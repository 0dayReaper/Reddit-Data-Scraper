    "postText": "In 1995, a series of unexplained events rocked the once peaceful beachfront hotel of Newhall Suites. The sinks and baths began to ooze foul smelling water. Clothes, keys, and later, children started to go missing.\n\nOn the cool Virginia beach things started to be found. Ancient artifacts from a time gone bye. Shattered clothes marred with teeth and blood. Chess pieces embedded with teeth.\n\nThe string of occurrences came to a climax in the summer of 1996, in which Newhall Suites suffered a fatal blackout. When the lights finally returned- seventy people had vanished- half the staff and guests, chosen at random.\n\nSince then, curious visitors have reported feelings of distinct paranoia, a sense of being watched.\n\nToday, Newhall Suites is scheduled for destruction. But in its center is an artifact responsible for events of 1995, an artifact certain clients are willing to pay a heavy sum to collect.\n\nMy name is Quentin Lorreno. I\u2019m somewhat of a middleman in the criminal underworld. I mediate the crime families, I arrange diplomatic marriages, I keep things civil.\n\nBut above all I host auctions. Art is a tastefully wonderful medium of laundering money, and hosting both underworld- and legal auctions is kind of my speciality.And I also recover and sell cursed artifacts.\n\nI had seen the woman at the Auction House a number of times before. She was wealthy, always surrounded by the same four bodyguards, and always seemed to carry briefcases filled to the brim with cash.\n\nNow, she waited in the lobby while I finished up a call with a potential client. She chatted with my assistant, Steven, and for a second, they seemed like normal old people, chatting and having a snack.\n\nThe opposite was true. They were both deeply embedded into the artifact black market. She paid to collect; we recovered and didn\u2019t ask questions.\n\nEveryone wins. Everyone profits, though I can\u2019t exactly think of a reason why exactly someone would want to collect cursed artifacts of all things. I suppose it was the risk, and the sort of show-offy thing the rich loved to see.\n\nThere was a guy who collected the bones of a Serpenthead Saint. There was a woman who liked to browse our warehouses in search of a certain feeling.\n\nThe nameless woman in the lobby seemed to have an eye for deadly, cursed paintings.\n\nI said my farewells to the client and cracked the door open. \u201cDo come in.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Mr. Lorreno,\u201d she replied, clapping. She waved to Steven, and she and her four bodyguards entered the room. Suddenly, I developed a fear of claustrophobia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem serving you, Miss-\u201d I paused.\n\n\u201cNames can be used for such deadly things, Lorreno,\u201d she insisted. \u201cYou have no need to know mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs usual, eh?\u201d I joked. \u201cWhat brings you to the House of Lorreno today?\u201d\n\nShe toyed with one of her many rings and bands on her arm, long enough to make me uncomfortable. \u201cI have located another Corelli, Lorreno.\u201d\n\nAh. A Corelli.\n\nThis did not bring good tidings. Isabell Corelli was, as Steven had educated, a painter who had lived a poor, terrible life in the mid-19th century. Her work came with a reputation in the artifact underworld, one of death and destruction.\n\nHer paintings, sculptures, crafts had a tendency to drive the mad man sane and the sane man mad.\n\nSome of them blinded those who saw. Some outright killed them. And some summoned great and incomprehensible things into the world.\n\nPreviously, I had only encountered a single set of Corelli paintings, ones that had pierced even the strongest of spells, and had been the deaths of fifty people. I wondered how deadly and how much risk I would take for the artifact the woman wanted.\n\n\u201cTell me about it,\u201d I decided; we had the necessary expertise to handle a Corelli. \u201cAnd how was the last Corelli we recovered for you?\u201d\n\nShe offered me a drink, and I accepted. One of her men unlocked a brief case and poured us a glass of Slisik. \u201cBrewed in the heart of the Stetski nests!\u201d she cheered, toasting the drink.\n\nI noted her clearly ignoring my question. I wasn\u2019t in the business for questions, anyhow.\n\n\u201cThose Serpentheads really know how to brew,\u201d I commented. \u201cBut really, do tell me about the artifact.\u201d I felt the need to add that I wasn\u2019t paying for the Slisik, but didn\u2019t bring it up.\n\n\u201cSummer of 1995, the Newhall Suite, a wonderfully brilliant beachfront hotel in the absolute best of Virginia,\u201d she explained. \u201cThat was the year occurrences started to manifest, people going missing, water going bad.\u201d She stopped, and then found a polaroid of a man shrouded in darkness, hands in beige, corduroy shorts.\n\nThe odd, unknown man also wore a sweater, despite being in the depths of summer. \u201cCoincidentally, that was the year this man paid for a room. His identity remains unknown, but what is known is that he spent the whole summer in his room.\u201d She paused to make sure I was digesting the information. \u201cPasserbys would often hear him, in his room, talking to a woman teaching him to paint. And children would find themselves suddenly awake in his room, staring directly at a painting I suspect is a genuine Corelli.\u201d\n\nI pondered on this. \u201cA genuine Corelli? Or could it be a reproduction?\u201d Even facsimiles of powerful artifacts- especially sigils or paintings, could replicate at least half of the effect.\n\nShe smiled and laughed, dismissing the thought. \u201cSomething that made seventy people disappear, kid, has to be a genuine Corelli. They say the painting trapped the souls of vanished into the art, and they loom in the background, waiting to be freed, tormented eternally.\u201d She opened a briefcase, revealing not cash this time- but gold. \u201cSurvive the trip, bring back the Corelli and this can all be yours.\u201d\n\nI inspected a bar. \u201cAre these unmarked?\u201d She nodded. \u201cWhat\u2019s the quality? Is this all vanity gold or are some enchantable.\u201d\n\nThis was the kicker. \u201cAll of them enchantable.\u201d Gold, the most refined and rare, could be used as a conduit for energy, allowing us to enchant and create whatever sigils or spells we needed.\n\nI called over my psychic, Aster, to verify her claim. But knowing the client, I knew it would be true. \u201cYou always bring out your Canary to judge me,\u201d the client commented. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you have faith?\u201d\n\nAster handled a bar, sensing its power. \u201cI have a name, you know. Aster.\u201d The client shrugged it over; it did not concern her. \u201cAnd Canary is such an old term.\u201d\n\nOld terms or not, this was a sweet deal, and Aster knew enough not to provoke the client. \u201cWe accept your deal,\u201d I decided, extending a hand. She shook it, cold, and unforgiving.\n\nShe smiled and offered me the entire case of Slisik, to which I accepted. \u201cAlways a pleasure doing business with you, Mr. Lorreno.\u201d She stood and tossed me a small glass sphere. \u201cThis was once your father\u2019s, but now I hand it to you.\u201d\n\nI studied the glass sphere, empty but engraved with symbols. \u201cYou knew my father?\u201d\n\nShe only waved and walked away. I wondered when I\u2019d really know how deep my father\u2019s dealings went. And how much longer it would take to pay off his debts.Mysterious woman or no, we had a mission.\n\nAs soon as the House was closed to the public I gathered the rest of my team. Together, united, we were a force to be reckoned with. My knowledge and access to my father\u2019s files- Aster\u2019s gift for the bizarre, Steven\u2019s affinity for spellcast, and Matt\u2019s plain old brute force.\n\nThe client had given us a small fortune of money we could spend on tickets. With spellcast, getting through airport security would be a breeze.\n\nMatt raised a hand. \u201cQuestion- what if the painting tries to eat us. Like the seventy people abducted?\u201d This was a good and valid point.Luckily, Steven had an answer. \u201cIt\u2019s been over two decades since that event, and nobody in the area has vanished since then. I\u2019d even venture that it was an isolated incident.\u201d\n\nAster was next to point something out. \u201cRight, but realistically, who\u2019s going near that place?\u201d she pointed at the images I had projected. \u201cIt\u2019s creepy, and being demolished.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly- it's being demolished- there must\u2019ve been construction workers or surveys recently, right?\u201d Steven argued.\n\n\u201cWe barely know anything about the place,\u201d Matt added; this, for the most part, was true. Besides the client\u2019s story, we\u2019d found little information online, which surprised me- seventy people missing should have raised more than just a buzz. \u201cDo we really want to go in blind?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe go in blind all the time,\u201d Steven reminded, starting to point out all the times we\u2019d recovered artifacts not knowing anything about the place.\n\nAster shook her head, siding with Matt. \u201cGoing blind is fine. But we don\u2019t go in blind for a Corelli.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if it is a genuine Corelli,\u201d I refuted.\n\n\u201cAnd we don\u2019t know who the hell painter guy is,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cHe was clearly the catalyst to whatever happened there.\u201d\n\nWe would be arguing all night if we continued like this. So I offered them a compromise. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we sleep it off?\u201d I shut down the projector. \u201cGo home, rest, and think on it. If you feel up to it, meet me here at six in the morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t?\u201d Matt asked.\n\nI shrugged. \u201cThen we don\u2019t go.\u201d I paused, thinking. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put any one of you in danger, and I don\u2019t want to go looking for a Corelli blind, at that, without the full force of everyone.\u201d\n\nAster laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re a good boss, Quentin.\u201d I shrugged. Maybe I was, maybe I wasn\u2019t. In truth I was a bit scared of going in blind. And Corelli\u2019s had such violent reputations I was starting to wonder if I should cancel after all.\n\nBut I slept on it. And so did the others.\n\nI came in to work at six the next day, ready to cancel if even one didn\u2019t show. But to my surprise, they all were there, already away and eating away at a box of bagels on the sofa.\n\nMatt threw me a bagel. I caught it. \u201cYou\u2019re late, Quentin.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s six fifteen,\u201d Aster pointed out, staring into the soul of a clock. I informed her the clock was ten minutes ahead. She chided me on not fixing it.\n\n\u201cI suppose we\u2019re all ready?\u201d they nodded, agreeing. \u201cSteven- pack everything you need. Don\u2019t forget the Silverback Glasses- don\u2019t want us seeing any symbols.\u201d I stopped listing equipment. \u201cI trust you know what to bring?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, all that and more,\u201d he finished.\n\nWith that ready, I settled myself in my office, grabbed a bottle of Slisik, poured a cup and drank it. It shot me into focus, and the drowsiness of the morning faded away.\n\nI snatched an enchanted dagger a man by the name of Mognis had given me. I found the pistol my father had often used and tucked it.\n\nThis was it. I was ready. And so was the House.\n\nWe were off to the airport, taking Steven\u2019s odd but still useful van. City paved into suburbs. Suburb paved into the country, and country soon paved into the ever bustling airport.\n\nThree hours later we were in Virginia, checking into our hotel for the night. And right after that we rented a car and drove to the Newhall Suites.\n\nThe place was essentially a large \u2018V\u2019.\n\nIt opened into the beach, and seemed ever larger than how the numerous photos had depicted it. To add insult to injury, a light rain had gathered above the hotel, and the waves crashed into the building, gently flooding it.\n\nWhen it was clear that nobody was around and we hadn\u2019t been followed we exited the car, opened the trunk, and retrieved our weapons.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cAs ever as I\u2019ll be,\u201d Matt managed, slinging a large rifle over his shoulder.\n\nI turned to Aster, who reached out into the ether, a blank look in her eyes. \u201cSomething powerful- not of this world. It\u2019s dormant, but it\u2019ll wake when we enter.\u201d She reached further. \u201cIt feels like a Corelli, but not quite.\u201d I asked her if she could pinpoint the exact location. \u201cLeft wing. Can\u2019t seem to pinpoint which room exactly- keeps shifting.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood enough, let\u2019s go,\u201d I ordered, standing up and walking onto the beach. The rain was cool, unforgiving, and even the wind seemed against us, sending shards of sand flying at every step.\n\nSteven opened his phone, found a document and read off of it, casting a light protection spell. The sand gently stopped.\n\nMatt raised a hand. \u201cThere\u2019s movement up ahead.\u201d\n\nWe observed the lobby. Ever slightly, there was movement, two shadows searching the area. Perhaps looters, perhaps curious explorers. No- they way they methodically checked every corner and carried themselves made me wonder if they were something more akin to our expedition.\n\nThey hadn\u2019t noticed us, and as silent as them, we slipped into the main lobby. Matt hand-signaled us to positions; we would take them by surprise.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d Matt shouted, alerting the two, rifles poised directly at them. \u201cHands where we can see them.\u201d They stepped out from the shadows, two men with weapons as dangerous as ours.\n\n\u201cCalm it, cool it,\u201d one of them managed, setting his weapon down. The other followed suit. \u201cWe\u2019re just urban explorers.\u201d\n\nSteven looked at them blankly. \u201cWhat type of urban explorers carries a gun like,\u201d he picked up the weapon and studied it, \u201cthat?\u201d\n\nThis was when I noticed they were wearing uniforms, a dark green with a distinct VII sewn into them. \u201cThey\u2019re with the Company,\u201d I informed.\n\nCompany 7 was in essence, the more legal side to the artifact trade. They recovered the bizarre, took them into their elusive warehouses across the world, away from the hands of evil.\n\nThey also went over rogue artifact dealers, and the black market. Unfortunately for us, we were the black market they were so intent on stopping.\n\nThe first man, about my age and clearly the leader, spoke, \u201cYou must be artifact dealers.\u201d He sized us up, studying each of us. \u201cWhat family do you work for?\u201d\n\nI shook my head. \u201cWe\u2019re independent contractors,\u201d I said. \u201cHouse of Lorreno.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of you,\u201d the other man noted. \u201cBut I thought Antony Lorreno was killed by the Company?\u201d This was news to me- my father had vanished on a cruise ship, searching for an artifact supposedly on an island plagued by ancient beasts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Quentin,\u201d I explained. \u201cAnd I have nothing against the Company.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just looking for the Corelli,\u201d Aster added.\n\nA frown fell on the leader. \u201cCorelli\u2019s don\u2019t belong in the hands of the black market.\u201d he seemed angry at this, a sort of personal anger I hadn\u2019t expected. \u201cTell me, do you know what your client plans to do with such a thing as dangerous as that?\u201d he added a final tidbit. \u201cWe weren\u2019t told there was a Corelli here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t ask questions,\u201d Steven countered. \u201cAnd if you people aren\u2019t here for the Corelli- why?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not your business.\u201d They both stood up now, challenging us. \u201cWe\u2019d like to go now.\u201d\n\nMatt placed a finger on the trigger. \u201cDon\u2019t you move!\u201d\n\nI raised a hand and pushed his weapon down. \u201cIf we take them,\u201d I pointed out, \u201cthe Company will go after us and burn everything down.\u201d Matt, and the others complied. I stared deep into the eyes of the leader. \u201cWe have no reason to fight each other- but maybe we can make a deal?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat deal would suffice?\u201d he arrogantly mocked. \u201cThe Company hass the information it needs. We can crush you any day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you do, my clients take business elsewhere,\u201d I refuted. \u201cAnd the House of Lorreno is inclined to deliver information on\u2026 dangerous clients.\u201d I extended a hand. \u201cIn this instance, we both win.\u201d\n\nHe shook it. \u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a deal.\u201d And with that, the two were off, walking coolly away into the wind and rain. \u201cBe careful,\u201d the other said, a warning, handing me a card.\n\nWe didn\u2019t wait then.\n\nAster reached into the beyond and we followed her, stepping over long destroyed debris and fallen statues. This was when the true scale and power of the artifact hit me.\n\nA deep sense of fear filled me, filling me with dread. I was afraid. Goosebumps lined my skin, and I thought about turning back.\n\nA freezing chill dawned upon us, and as we crossed into the deceript halls it only got colder. I started to see shadows moving, writhing out of the corner of my eyes, and yet, every time to turned to face them- they vanished.\n\nAnd then they would be-\n\nI felt my head spin and my vision warp, and suddenly- a wall slid in place in front of us, one that had not been there before.\n\nI heard a heavy sliding noise behind us and- a wall slammed in place, trapping us in the hall.\n\nAnd the paint on the wall started to shift, bulge, and that was when I felt truly scared of the building. \u201cShouldn\u2019t have gone in blind!\u201d Matt admonished.\n\nThe bulging paint turned to dripping blue insects, now breaking free and charging for us. \u201cSteven- dispel this!\u201d I shouted, firing at the paint.\n\nBullets hit the constructs, splattering paint across the floor. More and more emerged from the walls, living beings made of chemical and dust.\n\nSteven weaved some ancient art into the air. It pulsed, disintegrating the spirits. This was when the floor began to open up. \u201cCan\u2019t!\u201d\n\nThe warped and spiraled, transforming into a sinkhole that steadily grew. \u201cTo hell with this!\u201d Matt screamed, tossing flash-sphere into the hole.\n\nNothing happened. Aster suddenly developed a dark look into her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s awake- the thing inside- no, he\u2019s- he\u2019s awake.\u201d\n\nThe sinkhole grew in size. I found myself against a wall, batting painted constructs away from me, terrified. \u201cCan you communicate?!\u201d\n\nAster tried. \u201cHe- he wants us to leave!\u201d My mind shot back to the image of the unknown guest. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave!\u201d Aster shouted. An unseen thing spoke to her. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for the Corelli!\u201d\n\nThis was when the chaos stopped. The sinkhole closed, the walls slide away. The heightened cold vanished.\n\nThe hallway, dark- paint and color gone from the walls extended ad infinitum. At the end was the figure of a man with hands in his pockets and a stern, tall look.\n\n\u201cWe were sent to find the Corelli!\u201d I shouted. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\nAster tugged at me and shushed me. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand- we need to leave-\u201d she started to back away, and so did the rest of us.\n\nThe figure stepped into the light. It was indeed the man in the photograph, the young artist, hands kept in pockets. But in the dark, he seemed false, almost, different, a mere facsimile of a man.\n\n\u201cCorelli has given me life anew,\u201d the figure boomed, voice coming from all around us. \u201cIt is not yours to take!\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t understand. But Aster did. \u201cHe- he is the Corelli!\u201d The man was the thing created by the long-dead painter. He was the enchanted thing the woman so wanted.We should not have gone in blind.\n\nThe Painted Man phased forward- and then again. He outstretched a hand, and the walls began to return to their original, colored state.\n\n\u201cThose who seek the Corelli,\u201d he declared, \u201cmust die!\u201dAnd then the creatures returned, beings borne of pain. Bravely, we retreated, but with every corner we turned- he was there.\n\nAnd then we stopped, painted limbs rising from the floor. I struggled, slashing at them with my knife. Aster reached out and crushed her bonds. Matt fired wildy. Steven cast spheres of fire-\n\nSphere?\n\nThat was it. I found the glass sphere the client had given me and opened it.\n\nThe hotel screamed in agony as I did, and the painted constructs fell, rising into the air and disintegrating. A vacuum opened, and the paint started to swirl into the glass, filling in impossibly small space.\n\n\u201cShe has come back for my life,\u201d the Painted Man solemnly murmured. \u201cI have been- forsaken.\u201d\n\nAnd then the man himself disintegrated into nothing but ooze and globs of paint, vanishing into the jar.\n\nI looked into the glass. A face looked back out, frozen, somber, betrayed.\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Aster asked, confused. I told her that the client had given it to me.\n\nSteven inspected it, feeling the symbols. \u201cThis is the language of the Precursors,\u201d he puzzled. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 who exactly are we dealing with?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone who clearly has both the means to store the Corelli safely,\u201d I decided. \u201cIt\u2019s not our business to ask questions- but perhaps,\u201d I found the card the two agents had given me. Kyran Grey- Company 7, \u201cthey can.\u201d\n\nEnsuring there was nothing else to be found, we returned to the car, and by the next day, we were back in the House.\n\nI met the client, and we traded our goods. I was the proud receiver of a caseful of highly enchantable gold and she- the contained, secure Painted Man.\n\n\u201cI am quite surprised at your survival,\u201d the old woman noted. \u201cThe past three contractors found themselves dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is this guy?\u201d I demanded. \u201cThis Painted Man. Did Corelli really bring him to life?\u201d I studied the glass again. \u201cNo human has had the power to construct new, living beings that don\u2019t die.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorelli wasn\u2019t alone, you know?\u201d she informed; this was new information. \u201cShe was merely one of many avatars to the Painter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho the hell is the Painter?\u201d I questioned. \u201cYou\u2019re saying there are more like Corelli out there?\u201d I thought about the implications. \u201cMore Painted Men? More artifacts?\u201d\n\nShe chuckled at that and patted me as she got up. \u201cI thought your kind didn\u2019t ask questions.\u201d This was true. I was breaking a tacit code. \u201cCorelli\u2019s were always the most powerful of the line. But now- thanks to you, there are none left in the wild- it\u2019s about time her creations given life- gave them back.\u201d\n\nI decided to cross the code. \u201cWho are you? Really?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d she opened the door and stepped out, \u201cyou already know.\u201d\n\nShe was Isabella Corelli. And for some unbeknownst reason she was gathering her artifacts once more, to gather them into safety and taking back their power.\n\nWhy now, two hundred years after her \u2018death\u2019 was she back- I didn\u2019t know. But it was as she said. My kind- the middle man, the artifact hunter. We didn\u2019t ask questions.\n\nThat was the day I started to wonder if we should ask questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Issue #4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13f8u81/i_sell_cursed_artifacts_for_a_living_dont_let/)\n\n[Issue #6](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13hgbhf/i_sell_cursed_artifacts_for_a_living_the_bone/)",

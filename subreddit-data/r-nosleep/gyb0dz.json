    "postText": "My dad always wanted a son. He got three daughters instead.\n\nHe hated us all, hated my twin sisters, hated my mother\u2026 but hated me most of all because I was the last child my mother had before she died. That didn\u2019t stop him from treating me like his little boy, didn\u2019t stop him from attempting to beat the hatred of my own gender into me. *Quit your crying*, he\u2019d snap, *or you\u2019ll end up like your sniveling bitch of a mother*. After years of that shit, he was shocked that I grew up as a tomboy.\n\nI think he hated that even more because I was just a constant reminder of what he never got to have.\n\nMy mother died when she was only twenty-seven, when I was only four \u2013 the coroner ruled her death a natural passing, some weird heart complication that took her in her sleep. My dad, though, he says it was because of her family\u2019s curse. Whenever I came to him, desperate for more information about a mother I never really knew, he never had much to say. I\u2019m convinced he was just drunk since the day she died. *Every woman in her damn family, they die when they\u2019re twenty-seven*, he\u2019d sputter in between belches, his breath reeking of stale beer.\n\nI think the real curse is that my mom was the one to die, and not him.\n\nI wasn\u2019t fully convinced by the ramblings of a perpetually drunk man, but when I lost both of my sisters just months before their twenty-eighth birthday, I knew it couldn\u2019t be a coincidence. Moira was found murdered, her face practically blasted off by a shooter while she was on a jog. Joy took her own life only days later. I was the one who found her, hanging in the bedroom of her apartment as I came to pick her up for Moira\u2019s funeral. She\u2019d been there, swinging from the rafters, all night.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to live a normal life when you know you have an expiration date, especially when it encompasses an entire year. I always dreaded my birthday, which from an early age became associated less with fun and birthday cake and more with worry and funeral caskets. But once Moira and Joy died, my next birthday \u2013 twenty-five \u2013 was the most dreadful day of my life. Twenty-six was worse, twenty-seven unimaginable.\n\n*This is it*, I thought as I closed all of the blinds in my apartment, downing the last drop of vodka in the bottle. *This is the last year of my life.*\n\nTwenty-seven has been uneventful, to say the least. Why would I make any long-term plans, forge any meaningful relationships when I know they simply cannot last? The worst part of this last year has been simply *not* knowing when my impending death is coming \u2013 it could have been any day within the last three hundred and sixty-four. It could be within the next minute.\n\nI must admit I became something of a recluse, my windows always shuttered, additional locks installed in my door, letting the phone ring through to voicemail, hiding under my covers with the lights out whenever I got a knock on my door. I stocked up on preserved foods and various goods that I would need to last the year. I was so paranoid that I even covered my mail slot, stuffed a towel in the space beneath my front door. I didn\u2019t want anything getting through from the outside world \u2013 god forbid, an *anthrax letter*.\n\nFalling off the face of the earth didn\u2019t matter much, anyway \u2013 I didn\u2019t have friends or family anymore. My mother and both of my sisters were dead, and my dad disowned me when I came out as a lesbian after my sisters died. I moved away and severed contact soon after.\n\nThe night before my twenty-seventh birthday, I started getting these strange phone calls from a blocked number. I\u2019ve always had anxiety about phone calls, so I just let it ring. The number kept calling, at least once per day throughout the past year. Then the knocking started, once a week at first, but it\u2019s only been getting worse \u2013 more frequent, and the pounding on my door more frantic each time. Convinced it had something to do with my inevitable death, I\u2019ve been driven mad by the unknown visitor, especially over the past week.\n\nI got ready for bed last night, knowing that tomorrow \u2013 today, now \u2013 is the day I will turn 28. My time had run out, and I searched for comfort in a bottle of liquor. I didn\u2019t find it. I fell into bed, drunk and delirious, and prayed the morning wouldn\u2019t come, though I knew it would. I eventually got to sleep, but it was restless and unsatisfying. The kind of sleep where you feel like you have one eye open, always watching.\n\nThat\u2019s why I was quick to wake when the door to my bedroom creaked open early in the morning, before the first sign of light. I shot up in my bed, glancing around my room in a frenzied panic, at first seeing nothing out of the ordinary other than the door, pushed slightly ajar. A closer look revealed something I\u2019d missed, something that sent my heart racing, froze me to my core. Two dark figures stood in the empty space behind the half-opened door, unmoving, almost like a pair of statues.\n\nWaiting. Watching. Wordless.\n\n\u201cLeave me\u2026 leave me alone,\u201d I squeaked, unable to move, paralyzed in the power of their presence.\n\nThe shadowy figures instead shuffled out from behind the door, creeping slowly towards me in the dark. I knew this would certainly be the end of my life, the fulfillment of my curse, if I didn\u2019t act. Suddenly recalling the self-defense methods I\u2019d drilled into my mind, I flipped my bedside lamp on to stun the intruders and reached underneath the table to pull the knife I\u2019d duct taped there a year ago \u2013 a twenty-seventh birthday gift to myself.\n\nAs soon as the light flooded the room, though, I knew the blade would be of no use.\n\nMy intruders were not a pair of assassins \u2013 not human ones, at least. In the yellow light of the lamp I discerned the identities of the dark figures. They were my sisters. Joy stood at the foot of my bed, pale, in that same conservative black dress I\u2019d found her dead in years ago, the one she\u2019d picked out for Moira\u2019s funeral. Her head hung parallel to her shoulders, neck grotesquely bent from her hanging.\n\nMoira was a few steps behind her. I could only assume it was her, considering the severity of her injuries \u2013 she\u2019d suffered a gunshot wound to the head, so brutal that we were not allowed to see her after her death, so intense that it had entirely disfigured her face. The lower half of her face had been reduced to a pit of gore, her jawbone barely attached on one side, her mouth mangled, with only several teeth remaining studded randomly throughout the mess.\n\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I cried, gathering my knees to my chest and holding them tight. \u201cAre you\u2026 are you here to take me?\u201d\n\nJoy made a feeble attempt to shake her head, the side of her face only brushing weakly against her shoulder. She waited several moments before putting one of her feet in front of the other, moving towards the side of my bed. As I recoiled instinctively, she slowed her pace. Moira trailed after her until they were both beside me.\n\nI whimpered as Joy leaned over me, her head flopping forward suddenly with the motion, neck cracking sickeningly. With her lips brushing against my ear, she whispered, \u201cshe\u2026 she tried.\u201d Her speech was labored and wheezing, as if her vocal cords had nearly been shredded.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, Joy?\u201d I pleaded.\n\nHer lips moved against my ear once more, but no sounds came out despite a clear strenuous effort. Moira wagered an attempt at answering my query, but only succeeded in sputtering blood from the gaping wound in her face, ejecting one of her remaining teeth onto the floor as her jawbone swung precariously, barely hanging on. She raised one hand, slowly curling it into a fist before striking her knuckles furiously against my bedpost.\n\nThe incessant sounds startling me, I forced my eyes shut tight and pulled my knees even closer against my chest. Moira\u2019s knocking seemed only to escalate in volume, seemed to go on forever, until \u2013 finally \u2013 it stopped. I cracked my eyes open to find that both of my sisters had vanished, that the light of early morning had begun to spill in through the slats of my blinds. It was just past six o\u2019clock, the seventh of June, the day of my twenty-eighth birthday.\n\nI was born at 9:26 AM \u2013 once I learned of the curse, I burned the time of my ultimate expiration into my mind. I only had three hours and sixteen minutes left to live\u2026 if I even *had* that long. Draping my covers over my head, I resolved to spend the rest of my life asleep. I figured I\u2019d rather pass peacefully in my sleep like my mother did than to suffer a fate similar to my sisters\u2019.\n\nMy plans were interrupted, however, by that damned knocking on the door. The interruption usually didn\u2019t come so early in the morning. I decided initially to ignore the strange visitor but pulled the blankets back down soon after as a certain sense of familiarity struck me. The pounding on the door reminded me all too much of Moira\u2019s knocking just moments before.\n\nIt easily could have been a trick of the curse, but something compelled me to approach the door. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I called from behind the barrier, clinging to the relative safety it provided.\n\nThe reply came from an unfamiliar man\u2019s voice. \u201cI just have a letter for you, miss.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust\u2026 just slide it under the door, and please leave,\u201d I returned, using my bare foot to remove the towel I used to block the small space beneath it.\n\nHe deposited a bright yellow envelope under the door as I requested. I waited quietly for the sounds of receding footsteps before sliding on a pair of gloves to handle the letter. It was addressed to me, simply by first name and with no address. Carefully, I unsealed the envelope to reveal a birthday card. I hadn\u2019t received one in years.\n\nBright, sparkling letters on the front formed the words, *Daughter, you\u2019re 27!*. I scoffed at the sick joke. I hadn\u2019t received a birthday card since I was a child, and my dad couldn\u2019t even get my birthday right. I didn\u2019t think he even knew my address. I cracked it open gingerly to read the message inside.\n\n*Laura,*\n\n*If you\u2019re reading this, your father has killed me. Don\u2019t believe a thing he or the police say \u2013 I was not the target of a random attack, I did not die of natural causes, and I certainly did not commit suicide. I would never leave you if I had the choice.*\n\n*The truth is\u2026 I died is because I found the truth behind my family\u2019s curse and foolishly told your father. He was in on it the whole time, planted in my life by some secret society to eradicate me. To eradicate us. What we have is not a curse, it is a gift \u2013 a gift of immense power. The power to heal, but the power to harm just the same.*\n\n*We come into our power at the age of 28, a number associated with independence, leadership, and self-sufficiency. An age where we can handle the responsibility such a power inevitably comes with. It\u2019s a strong number, and you will come into great strength, though you\u2019ve always been a strong girl.*\n\n*I hope you\u2019ve made it this far, but at the same time\u2026 I know you have. You were always a feisty little girl for the four years I had the pleasure of knowing you, of loving you. You never let anyone tell you what to think or do \u2013 especially not your father.*\n\n*Happy birthday \u2013 I love you.*\n\n*Mom*\n\nI closed the card softly, thinking on the strained words of my sister \u2013 mom had tried to warn them, but they didn\u2019t listen. The pieces of the puzzle slid into place\u2026 my dad must have murdered Moira, and Joy ended her own life out of grief and a belief that she would inevitably be next.\n\nAt the time of writing this, I only have two hours and thirty-two minutes until I officially turn twenty-eight. Over the past hour or so, I\u2019ve already begun to feel the power flowing into my body, electrifying as it runs through my veins. I will the towel to reposition itself under the door, and it does so, sliding across the floor on its own.\n\nI need to keep myself safe until 9:26, after all.

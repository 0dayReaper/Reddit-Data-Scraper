    "postText": "As a person who has lived with their parents up until college, you can say I was spoiled. I was an only child, so I was always a priority. I was in private school my entire life, so I was protected by everything. My mother was a nurse and my father was a surgeon. Anyways, let\u2019s talk about the nightmares. \n\n\nThey first started when I first moved into my dorm. The dorm is really old. 234 years old to be exact. It\u2019s really creepy. People who have lived in the dorms gave me a set of rules to follow;\n\n\n1. Do NOT look the girl into the eye in the event of a nightmare. \n2. If you do look her in the eye, repeat the words \u2018I deeply and sincerely apologize and regret my actions\u2019 the girl should start to calm down.\n3. If the girl does not calm down, you have  failed, and will not wake up. \n4. If the girl offers tea, repeat \u2018My mother doesn\u2019t allow me to have tea. I do not disobey my mother.\u2019\n5. After 8:23 pm, you must get in your bed. All lights will go out for exactly 7 seconds. If you see eyes in the darkness, immediately shut your eyes. \n6. Last and final rule, do NOT shove things under your bed. He doesn\u2019t like his home crowded. \n\nAfter receiving these rules, I got goosebumps. Whose He? What eyes? What girl? I tried watching a movie to calm myself down. I was getting tired so I checked the time. 8:23. Less than 1 minute to get into bed. I turn the TV off, rush to my bed and get under the covers. The lights shut off. 1, 2, 3, I counted. 4 seconds later, it was done. I saw no eyes, so that part was definitely relieving.  I try to go to sleep, but I can\u2019t. I have so many questions. Most importantly, Why do we need rules? I shut my eyes and a few moments later, Im sleep. In my dream, there is one table. It\u2019s glowing. Everything else is dark. 2 chairs appear. They are also glowing. A girl appears on one chair. Shes maybe 5 or 6 but her eyes are glowing. I realized the rules. Oh no. She starts crying loudly. I almost start crying. \u2018I deeply and sincerely apologize and regret my actions.\u2019\nThe crying stops abruptly. \u2018Would you like tea?\u2019 \u2018My mother doesn\u2019t allow me to have tea. I do not disobey my mother.\u2019 \u2018Aw, okay. she said. I wake up, sweating. \n\n\nLights are off, but I didn\u2019t turn them off. I start sweating even more. I calm myself down. The nightmares counting for the next week. I ask my dorm neighbor about these nightmares and he says these nightmares last 10 days, meaning I have 3 days left. He said if they counting after 10 days, slip a note under your bed with it saying, \u201cNightmares will not stop. I seek help.\u2019 with a pen. Almost immediately He should slip it back with an answer. If He doesn\u2019t, He cannot help you. 3 nights later, I\u2019m overwhelmed with joy that the nightmares are finally over. I get into bed, excited to have my first normal dream in a while. I go to sleep but, the table is still there? The chairs appear, and so does the girl. I look in her eyes because I was not expecting her. She starts crying. \u2018I deeply and sincerely apologize and regret my actions\u2019 \u2018Would you like some tea?\u2019 \u2018My mother doesn\u2019t allow me to have tea. I do not disobey my mother.\u2019 \u2018THATS NOT TRUE!\u2019 she says. \u2018What?!\u2019 I wake up. Sweating. I grab my notebook, write \u2018Nightmares will not stop. I seek help.\u2019 He didnt send it back. I\u2019m scared. Next day, like everyday, 8:24, lights go off. This time though, I see eyes. I guess I didnt close my eyes fast enough, because after the lights are turned on, the eyes are closer. They come into my body, taking control. \u201cI\u201d start screaming. I can see everything happening, but it\u2019s not like I have control. The paramedics come. \u2018There\u2019s no hope, she looked into the eyes.\u2019 \u2018Unfortunate\u2019 one paramedic said. They take me into a room full of other people. The same thing happened to them. I\u2019m still in here. Help.",

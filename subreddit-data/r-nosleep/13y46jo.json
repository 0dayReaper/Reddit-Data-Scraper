    "postText": "When you don\u2019t see someone for a while, they tend to look kind of different the next time you meet. That\u2019s not because they\u2019ve actually changed, but rather due to your memory being inaccurate. Still, I don\u2019t think my roommate has always had barnacles growing on her. \n\nKit Sutton did indeed look different. Beautiful, but different. \n\nIn the short time we\u2019d been apart, her hair had grown to an impressive length. It trailed after her through the water as she effortlessly hopped from rock to rock before landing in front of us. She was even more scantily clad than usual; in fact, she wasn\u2019t wearing anything at all. Her normally olive skin had adopted a pearlescent sheen, interrupted by the algae, starfish and seashells clinging to her body. Her eyes shone in the light of our torch and she regarded us with an unreadable expression, putting a hand to her hip.\n\n\"I can't believe you're actually here.\" She shook her head, sounding like she wasn't even sure herself what tone to strike. \"You\u2026 you'd better leave. And fast. I-it's nice to see you, though.\"\n\nI took a step forward and hugged her. She felt slippery. \"I've missed you.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Me too. You should still go now.\"\n\n\"You need to come back,\" I said. \"I'm sorry I ever gave up on you. There has to be a way for you to come back.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Eva, you saw what my father can do. You saw the wave and you just saw his grotto guard. There's, like, a thousand more where that one came from.\"\n\n\"What are you doing here anyways? Isn't this a kinda way too lonely spot for you to hang out?\" Elijah asked. \"Doesn't seem very *you*.\"\n\n\"Yeah. It's\u2026 not.\" She rolled her eyes. \"I'm basically grounded. My Dad's gonna keep me here for the next two hundred years or so. I'm not allowed to leave until he trusts me again.\"\n\n\"Two hundred years?\" Eli echoed.\n\nKit massaged her temples. \"I don't like it either, believe me.\" Looking up, a hopeful expression crossed her face. \"How's Nettie?\"\n\n\"She misses you,\" I told her.\n\n\"She does? That's, um\u2026 nice.\"\n\n\"It's cool, I know about you two.\"\n\n\"Oh. Well. I'm really glad she's thinking about me. Is that mean? Because I don't want her to be unhappy, it just feels good, you know?\"\n\n\"I can imagine,\" I answered. \"And it only proves my point. We have to get you out of here.\"\n\n\"Dude, I said no. You actually can't beat my father. I wish that was an option, but it's simply *not*.\"\n\n\"Kit\u2026\"\n\n\"It's Chandra.\" She raised her head to fix me with a stern gaze. So empty, so joyless, so\u2026 unlike her. \"It was nice being Kit and running around up top and living with you. Those were a good few years, and now here I am, paying the price. There is nothing you can do against my Dad.\"\n\nSilence descended upon us for a sober couple seconds. I studied her expression, her set jaw and taut shoulders. \"And what about you?\" I asked. \"Can *you* do something?\"\n\nKit snorted. \"You've never even seen me use any sort of powers.\"\n\n\"But you have them, don't you?\"\n\n\"Actually, I do.\" She casually raised a hand, her wrist slowly describing a circle. Eli and I watched in astonished silence as a trail of water snaked its way up from the lake, arching above her head and trickling back down on the other side of the stepstone. Kit Sutton looked after it disinterestedly, then turned to us with a bored shrug. \"I guess I can sorta control water.\"\n\nElijah was gaping at her. \"Could you do this the whole time?\"\n\n\"Nope. Only when I'm in my natural habitat. I'm the *crown princess*\u2014\" she spat out the words in discontent, forming air-quotes around them\u2014 \"and the heiress to the throne, so I'm, like, ultra connected to my element or whatever. Not like my siblings.\"\n\n\"But as of now, you *are* stronger than them?\" I queried. \"Is there any possibility you could become stronger than your father, too?\"\n\nFor a moment, she stared at me, her bottom lip caught between her teeth. \"Actually, let me show you something.\" Her naked feet never once slipping on the wet stone, she proceeded towards the nearest platform rock, jumping off with ease and landing gracefully. After trading shrugs with Elijah Carter, we scrambled after her. She led us back a little ways and then down one of the other passages we'd glimpsed before, barely losing a word the whole time. I stopped trying to strike up a conversation, focusing solely on keeping up with her unnaturally sleek, swift steps. \n\n\"The olm you saw before was one of my father's guardians,\" she called out sharply over her shoulder. \"The sea breeds giants, as they say. Or rather, Dad does. He keeps creating abominations like that, and he uses them to ward off outsiders in places where they don't belong. They're obviously not stopping me from running away again\u2014you've seen that they'll obey me. But his Majesty has made it quite clear that if I break out, he's going to turn the town into a swamp. I'm not going to be responsible for people's deaths, or the loss of their homes. Especially not\u2026 not hers.\"\n\nShe came to a halt, squaring her shoulders. Above her head, I could make out the silhouette of an opening in the tunnel. \"We're here. This\u2026 this should be enough proof that he'll make good on any threat he's ever uttered.\" She stepped aside to make way for us.\n\nWe hesitantly pushed past her and into the room that lay before us. It was different from all the others we'd seen thus far\u2014it didn't lure one into a false sense of security with its descriptive beauty. In fact, the second the beam of our flashlight illuminated its interior, every last fiber of my being started to cry out to me, telling me to run. My flight instinct kicking in, I tried desperately to stay grounded somehow, to keep control. I couldn't allow myself to panic. This was a horrible time to end up going dimensions. I had to remain in this reality, no matter how difficult the sight before me was rendering the task. \n\nI heard Elijah Carter gag beside me, his stomach revolting at what he saw. His hand abruptly flew to my shoulder, cold, sweat-slick fingers clamping down on my skin, hard enough to bruise. With my own stomach doing kick-flips inside my body, I could understand his reaction far too well. Instead of shrinking away, I reached up to graze his knuckles with my own, a fleeting touch I couldn't find the strength to hold. It was hard to be reassuring given the circumstances.\n\nWe were looking at a *gallery* of corpses. They lined the walls, the floor, the ceiling, all in different states of wholeness and decay. A viscous, transparent fluid was gluing them to the stone, fixing them in their respective places. In some spots, it looked quite shiny and fresh, while in others, it had hardened, encasing the dead bodies like clear, pale amber. It was an unorganized chaos, the carcasses strewn practically everywhere, some overlapping, some upside down. Some had their eyes still open, their faces eternally frozen in void, empty expressions of terror. Most bodies weren't even complete\u2014arms, legs or heads were missing, pronounced bitemarks marring the aged yet well-preserved flesh. \n\nElijah and I found ourselves standing rooted to the ground, too terrified to move, too dazed to speak. My friend's dark gaze frantically raced over the walls, flickering across the horrid display, taking in the carnage. My own eyes seemed to be burning. My head was spinning, and I had to hold onto his arm to support myself\u2014it felt as though my legs were about to give way beneath me. \n\nA shimmering light at the center of the room caught my attention. Somehow finding it within me to steady myself, I took a couple faltering steps towards it. Elijah Carter followed suit and Kit Sutton wordlessly trailed after us. Stepping over the dozens and dozens of corpses in my way, I tried hard to keep my wits about me. When I finally reached its source, I was surprised to find it to be a pond, or rather a bottomless hole of water. Another connection to the sea, no doubt. The shine however seemed fine from within it, from down below where there would normally be just darkness. Looking in, the breath was once again stolen from my lungs. It felt rather like peering through a small window into a very large hall. I could only see a fracture of what lay beneath.\n\nHovering within the endless masses of water was the enormous statue of a woman. Her stony pale arms were raised, her hands reaching out almost pleadingly, as if she was hoping for someone to pull her up from her cold, abyssal grave. Her eyes, one of which was about the size of my head, were wide open, her colorless stare holding a wild, unreadable mix of emotions. Her lips were parted in a silent scream. An unearthly, bright glow surrounded her; it seemed to come from within her body rather than anywhere else. It was disturbingly beautiful.\n\n\"Her name was Calypso.\"\n\nKit's voice pulled me from my trance. When I turned to face her, she pointedly avoided my gaze. An idea took shape in my mind, created by the faint, wavery undertone of mourning in her words. \"She was someone special, wasn't she?\"\n\n\"My mother.\"\n\nI swallowed, my pulse still thrumming in my ears. Stepping forward, I tentatively grasped my roommate's hand. She let go of a soft breath, the corner of her mouth twitching. \"These people here have been rotting away for centuries. It's the worst punishment imaginable, isn't it. The lucky ones are dead before they get glued down, but the ones he's really angry at, he covers in that goo when they're, like, lethally injured. I don't quite know *what* this stuff is, but it slows down all those organic processes, the death, the decomposition\u2026\" She paused. \"With Mom, it was different. He turned her to stone. The same kind that grows from the ground here, you know; that smooth, shiny kinda rock that looks real pretty.\"\n\n\"What did she do to piss off your Dad?\"\n\n\"What did any of these poor fuckers do? Most of these are failed cult leaders, actually. You'd never guess how many cults the deep ones have dedicated to them. As for my mother, I don't know. I can't even remember her, to be honest.\" She shrugged with affected carelessness. \"You see it now? My father is\u2026 just beyond comprehension.\"\n\n\"So are you, though, aren't you? If you think about it.\"\n\n\"Eva, I *know* you're trying to boost morale here, but it's not working. Please let me get you out of here. And for heaven's sake, don't come back.\" \n\nShe led us back through the labyrinth of tunnels and corridors, staying well behind when we caught the first glimpse of daylight. \n\n\"I promise I'll think of something,\" I told her. \"I'll find a way to get you out.\"\n\nShe merely shook her head. \"No, you won't. Just go home and look for a new roommate. Or move back in with Nettie. She'll be glad.\" \n\nI clenched my teeth, but allowed Eli to press his palm to my back, guiding me towards the exit. \n\n\"Actually, just\u2026 just wait. Could you tell her I, like, miss her? A lot?\" Kit shouted after us, a sudden note of warmth softening her voice. \n\nElijah turned back to her with a sad smile. \"Of course.\"\n\nWe didn't return to the car straight away, instead walking along the shore for a little while. My extra limbs having retracted and Eli's face having returned to a less nauseous color, we didn't bear any outward traces of our experience in the cave. We didn\u2019t talk much, but we almost leaned onto one other with how closely we stuck to each other\u2019s side. Eventually, I gathered the strength to break the silence. \u201cThis can\u2019t stand, obviously.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou still want to get her out?\u201d He gave me a sidelong glance. \u201cThis is more for Nettie\u2019s sake than anything else, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do like Kit Sutton, and I miss her tremendously,\u201d I stated. \u201cBut largely, it is.\u201d\n\nElijah, having nothing else to add, gave a noncommittal grunt.\n\n\u201cWould you mind if I asked you something personal?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cTry it and find out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was wondering about what Mary Markov said about you earlier,\u201d I began. \u201cAn incident at a highschool.\u201d\n\nHe sighed. Silence fell, and for a minute I thought he wouldn\u2019t respond at all. Then, he slowed down, coming to a halt and turning to look out at the horizon. \u201cSo how do we do this, Shirley? You really want me to pour my heart out to you and let you in on my tragic past as we stare at the tossing waves? That\u2019s a bit too romantic for the two of us, if you ask me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019d let me in on your tragic past in a less romantic setting?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh sure, anytime,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cWell, not *any* time. I\u2019d be okay talking to you about it, though. See, it doesn\u2019t matter to me if you know or not, the problem is kinda the headspace and getting the words out of my mouth in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you feel like you could do that with me.\u201d I regarded his profile, noting how he swallowed and shut his eyes for a moment.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the car.\u201d\n\nSo we did. Only that it wasn\u2019t quite how we left it. Elijah noticed it first\u2014a low, hissed curse escaped him as he bent down to inspect the damage. The back window had been smashed in. The brown folder Mary Markov had given me was gone.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13dr5g0/help_im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[2:

I'm guessing Jewel stole it to see if their acolyte spilled some more valuable information, but again, the lady cultist stayed quiet pretty much.",

I wouldn't be surprised if a few a those people are there for talking to Kit, Chandra whatevs. I feel like Chandra is a dead name, feels gross typing it.

            "comment": "Eva, I feel as though I know you enough to say that.. a really hard lesson in life (in THIS reality/dimension, at least) is that sometimes really bad things happen to really good people and that no matter how badly you want to change those things, there sometimes isn't a way to do so. You are a very logical thinker and we love that about you, but if Kit is telling you that she cannot go back to the life she had on the surface, then you have to accept that as the reality. It is a better option to simply work with what you **can** change and maybe one of the things you can change is if you or Nettie or Eli or Frank can visit Kit safely. She will be there for 200 years and the guards listen to her, so why not? It's still a life, just not the one any of you want. \n\nThat being said, I think that you're being disrespectful towards Nettie. Nettie told you out of confidence that she and Kit were together romantically and that she had taken the time to mourn and move on. She isn't fixed and there will always be a part of her heart that is broken, but you're blatantly going against her wishes and stringing her heart around all because you want to fix what cannot be fixed. It's very selfish of you. You can be selfish despite your intent. You're going to hurt Nettie again and again because you won't learn the lesson that she felt she couldn't trust you to do the night she sent you away to be with Kit. She doesn't want someone to solve her problems. She wants someone to listen and love her and understand. \n\nNot to mention that what you're doing is so dangerous, not just to you but Nettie, Eli, and Frank as well. Could you imagine how devastated Nettie would be if something were to happen to you during this meaningless mission? Could you imagine if you got Eli killed during one, the person she considers to be her closest blood relative? Could you imagine how you would feel if Frank got killed? And that's not to say anything about the repercussions Nettie might face if Kit's dad finds out about her relationship. \n\nStop this suicide mission, Eva. Stop. You're hurting and will hurt so many of the people you love and.. there's going to come a time when those people start to love you less and want you around less and feel the bond you have less because that's what happens when someone you love keeps hurting you. You love them less.",

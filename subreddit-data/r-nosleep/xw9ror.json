    "postText": "***Day One.***\n\nWe had just opened our textbooks to chapter eight when the alarms blared overhead. A red strobing light spun by the door as metal slats slid down the wall to seal us in. \n\nThe others started to stir and panic at their desks. \n\n\u201cNow, now. Class, I\u2019m sure everything is fine. Probably just a drill.\u201d Mr. Jonas held up his hands in an attempt to soothe the crowd. \n\nJust as he was about to open his mouth, Evie came over the intercom. \n\n\u201cLevel 3 Contagion located in the south quadrant of campus. Lockdown protocol is now in effect. Isolation protocol is now in effect.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d The teacher suddenly looked pale and a little panicked himself. \n\n\\---\n\n***Day Three.***\n\nI slid my rook across the tiled chessboard to overtake Patricia\u2019s bishop. She stuck out her tongue in defiance as I removed it from the board. I smirked and then shoved another saltine cracker in my mouth. \n\nMr. Jonas said we shouldn\u2019t be in here much longer. It was probably just taking the CDC a while to quarantine and eradicate the contagion. He said it must be a pretty nasty virus if they are keeping us locked in our classrooms. \n\nWe have enough snacks for another day or so. It\u2019s been difficult to ration properly when all you have are crackers, candy, and canned spray cheese. \n\nOverall, though, we were keeping our hopes up which was all we could really do. Staying positive, for now. \n\n\\---\n\n***Day Five.*** \n\nThe room was starting to smell foul. We\u2019d designated some buckets in the corner as the bathrooms and they were about half full and beyond putrid. \n\nWe ran out of food last night. My stomach rumbled with hunger, but I did my best to ignore it. I didn\u2019t feel like playing chess or reading anymore, instead I just napped at my desk as much as possible to pass the time. I was hoping at any moment I\u2019d be awoken to the doors opening so that I could go home. I missed my parents. \n\nMr. Jonas was losing his composure too. He\u2019d been pretty put together up to this point and ensuring we were all calm. But his eyes looked a little wild now, and he kept pacing the room talking to himself. A few times I heard him cursing under his breath and then reciting prayers. \n\nI really hope we get out of here soon. \n\n\\---\n\n***Day Eight.***\n\n*Bang\u2026bang\u2026bang*\n\nA pounding sound coming from the other side of the classroom pulled me from my dreams. \n\n*Bang\u2026bang\u2026bang*\n\nI stayed still to appear asleep but cracked my eyes just enough to watch as the Biology teacher smashed a chair against the steel door over and over again. \n\n*Bang\u2026bang\u2026bang*\n\nHe was really losing it.\n\n\u201cLet us out of here!\u201d Mr. Jonas screamed as he tossed the chair to the side. \n\n\u201cI cannot do that sir. A Level 3 Contagion has been detected. I have sealed off the affected area, but you must stay isolated for your safety.\u201d The robotic voice hummed over the speakers. \n\nHe screeched profanities at the camera in the corner of the ceiling. \n\nSome of the other boys were becoming aggressive as well. There had been some fights the last couple of mornings. Also, some hands going where they shouldn\u2019t be going, back behind the fake plants and lab equipment.\n\nIt seemed as if we were slowly devolving. Becoming an enclosure of chimpanzees, like one you\u2019d see at the zoo but only hungrier. \n\nWe needed out, or something terrible was going to happen. \n\n\\---\n\n***Day Ten.*** \n\nWe\u2019d been on a diet of tap water for the past five days. I felt dizzy every time I stood from my desk. The room would spin and I\u2019d almost black out. I kept my footing by sheer force of willpower. I had this irrational fear that if I passed out, I\u2019d be eaten by my classmates, like a pack of hyenas on a gazelle. Feasting on my intestines as they spilled across the tiled floor.\n\nIt sounded crazy if I said it out loud, but when I looked around the room and saw all the hungry faces, I didn\u2019t think the idea was too farfetched after all. \n\nMr. Jonas hasn\u2019t said a word in over twelve hours. He\u2019s just been sitting at his desk, carving something into the surface of it with an exacto knife. \n\nFor the first time today, I had the thought that maybe we weren\u2019t going to make it out of this. Maybe we were all going to die in this classroom. \n\nI hung my head and cried. \n\n\\---\n\n***Day Thirteen.***\n\n\u201cMr. Jonas! Mr. Jonas stop!\u201d Micah cried. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you see? We have to do this, we need food. It\u2019s survival 101. When the pack is suffering and food is scarce, they turn on their weakest member. It\u2019s simple biology. Survival of the fittest.\u201d \n\nMr. Jonas had his hands around Trevor\u2019s neck, squeezing so hard that the boy\u2019s eyes were about to pop from his skull. \n\nTrevor struggled beneath him, but he was frail and terribly small for his age. \n\nMicah grabbed a large beaker from the table and lifted it high over his head. \n\n\u201cMr. Jonas stop now! Don\u2019t make me do this!\u201d \n\nBut the teacher was long gone, his eyes gleamed with delight as drool dripped down his chin from salivating at the thought of a meal. \n\nI jumped to my feet as Micah brought the beaker down as hard as he could onto Mr. Jonas\u2019 head. It shattered to pieces on impact, knocking the teacher out cold. \n\nI helped Micah push him off Trevor. The poor kid was wheezing and gasping for air as tears streamed down his face. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re alright, it\u2019s okay, you\u2019re alright.\u201d Micah patted the kid on the back, trying to calm him as he wailed. \n\nSuddenly there was a scream like a war cry and Mr. Jonas was air born. He leaped across a desk and plowed into Micah. \n\nThey both went sprawling across the tile. Micah resisted him but Mr. Jonas ended up on top and began dropping his elbows viciously on Micah\u2019s face causing blood to spew from his nose and mouth. \n\nStatic filled my mind, I didn\u2019t think, I only reacted. I reached down and picked up a hunk of glass from the broken beaker, grabbed Mr. Jonas shaggy hair and pulled it back to extend his neck. I pulled the glass through the meat of his throat as hard as I could. \n\nI\u2019d never seen so much blood before. It poured in a waterfall across Micah\u2019s chest. \n\nMr. Jonas fell to the side once more, this time never to get up again. \n\nI stared at my blood-soaked hands. I felt nothing. No remorse, no fear. Only static. \n\nSuddenly the metal slats retracted into the ceiling and the door swung open. \n\n\u201c*Lockdown protocol has been lifted. Please continue with your regular schedules. Lockdown protocol has been lifted.\u201d* Her cheery robotic voice seemed so distant and out of place now. \n\nThe other students gathered around me, just staring at the pool of blood. I think it was the hunger talking, but a part of me wanted to know what it tasted like. I think the others did too. \n\nThankfully, before that could happen a man in a suit strolled into the classroom. \n\n\u201cHello, class.\u201d His perfect teeth gleamed under the LEDs. \n\nBefore we could say anything a team of adults in overalls poured into the room. Some began taking pictures of everything. Others started cleaning up Mr. Jonas. \n\nOne man with gray hair dropped a large box on the teacher\u2019s desk and opened it. He then started throwing fresh fruit and granola bars to each of the students. \n\nWe devoured everything he gave us. I started to feel more like myself after two bananas and four granola bars. They tasted like heaven, a sweet salvation. \n\nThe first man with the nice teeth in the expensive suit waited until we were all done before he addressed us again. \n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s been a long thirteen days guys, I appreciate you all hanging in there. I\u2019ve alerted each of your parents that you\u2019ve been cleared to go home.\u201d\n\nThe classroom erupted in cheers as we all hugged each other. Even Micah, covered in gore, danced around excitedly. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll all be able to go home soon but first I just need to do a little debrief with each of you before you go. I\u2019m going to set up in the counselor\u2019s office and Mr. Moses here is going to bring you down one by one to give your account on what happened here during isolation.\u201d \n\nWe all nodded our heads in agreement, anything to get out of here. \n\nMr. Moses, the man with the grey hair and the snacks, took us down one by one and we spilled our guts to the man with the nice teeth. \n\nWhen I gave my story on what it was like I still felt numb, even when describing how I\u2019d killed Mr. Jonas, I just felt\u2026 nothing. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I\u2019d gotten home that evening that I\u2019d broken down and wept. Once I was in my mother\u2019s arms I cried and cried until I couldn\u2019t anymore. Then I ate more food than I ever had. I shoveled pasta down my throat until I thought my stomach would burst. \n\nIt was a good feeling. To be full. To be human again. \n\n\\---\n\nYears later while I was at University a whistleblower had leaked that what we\u2019d endured at the school was a government coverup for a top-secret experiment. \n\nThere had been no virus, no contagion. It began as an experiment to test the artificial intelligence system they had at the school. But then it morphed into a social experiment to see how long we would last before someone was murdered or severely harmed. To test the boundaries of civility and moral character under immense pressure. Just in case there was a real issue with the code in the A.I. and this scenario became a reality elsewhere. \n\nWhen I\u2019d killed Mr. Jonas, it had ended the experiment. \n\nThe news had made me sick to my stomach, I was angry and disgusted for weeks. \n\nI was okay with it now though. You see, Trevor may have been small, the weakest member of the pride perhaps, but he was also a genius. With his hacking expertise we were able to locate Mr. Nice Teeth and Mr. Moses. \n\nIt\u2019s been six days so far and every time they scream and hit the door with a chair, I just can\u2019t help but smile. \n\nIt\u2019s a little experiment a few of us are conducting. It\u2019ll end when someone is murdered or severely injured. \n\nMaybe\u2026",

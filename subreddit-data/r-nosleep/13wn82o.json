    "postText": "Since freshman year I\u2019ve been in and out of trouble, often getting myself in all kinds of nasty situations. It was around that time my grades started to drop and my parents got more complaints from my teachers. I hung with the wrong crowds and would often get suspended. Over the years things got worse. My problems left school and became minor offenses with the law. Everything from shoplifting to vandalism. I can\u2019t even count the amount of times I\u2019ve been dragged home in a squad car, only to be snatched in and scolded by my dad.\r  \n\r  \nIn the middle of senior year not much had changed. My grades were overall still piss poor and I almost got busted for selling prescription pills. At that point I had messed up so much that my parents finally decided that they\u2019ve had enough. They gave me an ultimatum. I had just turned eighteen, so they told me either I got my shit together, or they were going to let me go - one more mishap and I was out of the house.\r  \n\r  \nHonestly, I\u2019ve been wanting to move out and get away from my parents for a while anyways. My \u201cunruly\u201d and rebellious acts in high school was a result of their constant bickering and attempts at controlling every aspect of my life. I\u2019ve become more and more annoyed with them as time passed.  \r  \n\r  \nAfter our talk I became determined to stay out of trouble. I still needed somewhere to stay before leaving, and I didn\u2019t want to get thrown out before I found a way to support myself. I was motivated to turn my life around. But I had to start somewhere, and it was in an industry I knew I\u2019d hate working in. \r  \n\r  \nFast food.\r  \n\r  \nI found a position at a burger joint. After a few weeks of faithfully punching the clock after school, and fulfilling my duty as a cashier, I really was off to a good start. That was until I decided I needed a car. Although my job was only a few blocks away, I thought I would need some reliable transportation for myself in the future.\r  \n\r  \nObviously I had no money to purchase a new car, so I planned on buying a used one. One day after school I made a trip to the nearest dealership and searched for a used vehicle with a low price. I wanted to get the car as soon as possible, but I had no credit and I couldn\u2019t pay the full price up front. I searched for other solutions.\r  \n\r  \nAn old acquaintance told me about a guy called Bucky-Mac. He told me this guy would loan me the money for the car no matter what my credit was like. From what I've heard, Bucky-Mac was primarily a drug dealer, but he also lent money to desperate people on the side. \r  \n\r  \nApparently he's been around for years, so I found it odd that I've never heard of this guy before. The fact that this guy was pretty much a loan shark did very little to deter me at the time. My sudden enthusiasm and hope that came with finally wanting to get my life together and taking my future seriously kind of clouded my judgment. \r  \n\r  \nI went to the guy that my old friend had informed me of. Bucky-Mac spent a lot of time in a spot located on the other side of town. It was in a wooded area, at the end of a long dirt road deep into a labyrinth of trees. I rode my bike over there that day, so it took me about ten minutes to travel down the dirt road and reach the small wooden house with boarded up windows. \r  \n\r  \nThere were four black trucks parked on the property, with a few men hanging out and standing here and there. One guy smoking a cigarette turned and spotted me coming his way. He stopped in the middle of taking another swig and stared at me as I came closer. The other guys nearby spotted me soon after. I rode closer to the guy with the cigarette and hopped off my bike. All the eyes glued on me made me feel uneasy, so I was slow about speaking. After seconds of awkward silence the cigarette smoking guy says,\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe curious men that surrounded him looked as if they also wanted to know.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI-I\u2019m Jake. I\u2019m here to talk to Bucky-Mac,\u201d I said.\r  \n\r  \nHe nodded his head in approval before flicking his still lit cigarette away. Then he gestured for me to follow him. I was led into the nearly dilapidated house, as many of the other guys had their gaze locked on me as I entered.\r  \n\r  \nThe place was mostly dark inside. But there were a few dimly lit areas, many of which were occupied with boxes and blocks of a suspicious substance heavily wrapped in tape. There was a guy inside hauling many of the blocks into the boxes as he taped them up. The house also reeked of marijuana. The scent was so strong I was surprised it didn\u2019t hit me while I was outside.\r  \n\r  \nWe made a turn down a hall which had a closed door at the end. The guy in front of me knocked twice when we reached it. The door swung open in seconds, revealing a middle aged man standing in the doorway. He was smiling. He glanced at me quickly then laid eyes back on the guy in front of me.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWho is this?\u201d he asked.\r  \n\r  \nThe guy in front me shrugged his shoulders.\r  \n\r  \nThe middle aged man\u2019s smile grew wider. He had one gold tooth. His hair was slicked back, and it shined in the sunlight beaming in through the window behind him.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d He said, still smiling.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m fine, man. You?\u201d I replied.\r  \n\r  \nAlthough I felt a little uneasy, I tried to present myself as confident and just as friendly as this guy appeared to be so far.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come into my office?\u201d He said, stepping back and giving way for me and the other guy to enter.\r  \n\r  \nWe walked in then the middle aged man closed the door behind us. There were two chairs sitting in front of a decorative desk, which had a revolver and a half consumed glass of liquor near it. I took a seat in one of the chairs, as the man came and sat behind his desk. The other guy stood by the door.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSo, what\u2019s up? \"\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou are Bucky-Mac, right?\u201d I asked.\r  \n\r  \nHe picked up the glass of liquor and gulped down what remained before saying,\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOf course, mate! All day everyday.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI looked behind me and saw the guy by the door grinning. Then I spun back around only to see Bucky-Mac still smiling.\r  \n\r  \nI sighed.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI need to borrow some cash,\u201d I said.\r  \n\r  \nFrom there I explained my situation. I told him that I just turned eighteen and was about to graduate high school in a few months. I informed him of my bumpy years of high school, why I wanted to turn my life around after graduating, and how the money would allow me to buy a car, which would be convenient during the job hunting process.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHmm, I see,\u201d Bucky-Mac mumbled, staring at his desk, \u201cYou seem to be a man of good intent. You made some mistakes, and now you wanna do better. I can respect that.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nHe pulled a bottle of booze from behind his desk and started to refill the glass in front of him.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou know, most people would find this hard to believe. But sometimes I wish I did the same when I was your age,\u201d Bucky-Mac continued, \u201cIf I had thought the same as you earlier on, I\u2019d have a much more stable life right now.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI heard the guy by the door chuckle, as if he disagreed with Bucky-Mac\u2019s statement. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cThanks, man,\u201d I said.\r  \n\r  \nHe offered me a drink, but I kindly turned it down.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNo worries, pal. You have my support,\u201d Bucky-Mac assured, \u201cSo how much we lookin\u2019 at?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThe second I left Bucky-Mac\u2019s spot I headed straight for the dealership and purchased the car I\u2019ve had my eye on. Then on the following day I pulled up to school in it. Some of the kids standing in the crowd in front of the school building noticed me as soon as I pulled into the parking lot. A few of them were my friends, and I often walked to school with them everyday. \r  \n\r  \nThey were surprised to see me suddenly pull up to school driving a car, and no longer walking with them. I must say, it felt good to drive around in a vehicle that I could say was mine. Although it was only a cheap used one, it was still my first car.\r  \n\r  \nAmong some of the kids in the crowd was a girl. She was standing in an area alone by the front doors. She was really tall, towering over most of the boys that stood in a group not too far away from her.  Her eyes were locked on me as I drove by. \r  \n\r  \nAbatha is her name. I\u2019ve known her since first grade. No, we weren\u2019t quite friends. If anything we were the opposite. Abatha has been a total bitch to me ever since the first day we met as small children.\r  \n\r  \nIt all started in second grade. Abatha snatched a toy from me. Then she proceeded to push me down and go crying to the teacher, saying I was the one that took the toy from her. The teacher believed her, and I was put in time out. I remember seven year old Abatha teasing me for the rest of the day after that.\r  \n\r  \nThis small childish incident  led to non-stop feuding between us, year after year, well into our high school years. Most of it was initiated by her. \r  \n\r  \nOften Abatha would taunt and harass me every chance she got. It became worse at the beginning of high school when my years of delinquency began. She had many field days laughing and making fun of me the second she found out I\u2019d gotten into some trouble.\r  \n\r  \nHer harassment was never anything more than verbal. Abatha never physically assaulted me, or displayed a desire to do so. I found this odd, as she very well could've, and inflicted some damage due to her large size. She\u2019s always been a larger girl. Even when we were younger she had always been taller than me. By the time junior year came around she was 6\u20194.\r  \n\r  \nAs I pulled into a parking spot I saw Abatha grin before turning and entering the school building.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nTwo hundred fifty dollar payments a week. That was the deal. I told Bucky-Mac about my job as a cashier and he was willing to work with me. I expected close to half of my check to be gone every time I got paid for the next few months, but it was for a good cause.\r  \n\r  \nI returned to Bucky-Mac\u2019s spot one afternoon after leaving work, to pay him his share. The first week of paying was a piece of cake. Easy in, easy out. But it was when I went back the following week I realized I may have made a grave mistake. \r  \n\r  \nHe wanted double of what was paid the previous week. Five hundred dollars. \r  \n\r  \nWhen he told me that, my stomach dropped. During our negotiation he specifically said two hundred fifty dollars per week. I was confused as to why he was changing the terms and conditions.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI forgot to mention a little something called\u2026interest,\u201d Bucky-Mac explained, \u201cLook at it this way. You\u2019re helping me, help you.\u201d Bucky-Mac said.\r  \n\r  \nThat friendly smile he once had when I first met him had turned into something else. \r  \n\r  \nI already knew there would be some interest involved, because otherwise he wouldn\u2019t make any profit lending money. But I didn\u2019t expect it to be that much. Fortunately I was able to make the payment, as I could work more hours than most high schoolers who were restricted by child labor laws. But I barely had any money left afterwards.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I went back the third week he wanted a thousand dollars.\r  \n\r  \nOne thousand dollars. \r  \n\r  \nI mean, there was just no way he could expect me to pull that kind of cash on the spot. Especially after I told him about my low paying occupation. \r  \n\r  \nI told him I couldn\u2019t pay him that week. Then that\u2019s when the shit hit the fan, and the guy beneath that friendly fa\u00e7ade came to surface. Bucky-Mac\u2019s smile faded completely, then he abruptly gained an expression of pure rage.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe had a deal,\u201d he said, standing up out of his seat.\r  \n\r  \nThat same guy from before was standing by the door, but the second Bucky-Mac stood up out of his seat, he moved in closer to me.\r  \n\r  \nWith my heart now racing, I mumble, \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything about interest rates this high -\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe had a deal!\u201d Bucky-Mac shouted.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDude, I get that. But w-we agreed to something totally different!\u201d I said, now starting to get even more nervous.\r  \n\r  \nI glanced behind me once more and saw that the other guy was almost leaning right up on me, still glaring. At this point I wanted to just run out of the room.\r  \n\r  \nAs Bucky-Mac walked from behind his desk the guy behind me wrapped his arm around my neck, locking me in a tight choke hold. I struggled to break free but the guy was too strong.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat the fuck is thi - \u201c I started. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \nBefore I could finish my sentence, Bucky-Mac came and punched me in the stomach. I grunted in pain then coughed multiple times. Then he kneeled down to look me right in the eye, as the guy behind me still had a hold on me.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNow I\u2019m gonna tell you this, Jake. I don\u2019t like being ripped off,\u201d Bucky-Mac said.\r  \n\r  \nI felt the guy's arm slightly constrict around my neck tighter.\r  \n\r  \nBucky-Mac searched my pockets then pulled out all the cash I was carrying, which wasn\u2019t very much. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou\u2019re short on payment,\u201d he continued, \u201cFrom now on, I want full payments every single week, starting next week. By then, I expect two thousand dollars sitting on my desk\u2026.no excuses. Or we\u2019re gonna have some serious problems, Jake.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nBucky-Mac delivered a few more punches to my gut before the guy behind me finally released me, letting me fall to the floor as I held my stomach.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou can leave my office now,\u201d Bucky-Mac mumbled, drawing a cigar from the inside of his suit.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAfter that incident I hadn\u2019t returned to Bucky-Mac\u2019s spot for two whole weeks.  Bucky-Mac called my phone constantly during that time. I ignored. Every time my phone rang and I saw his number my heart would instantly leap. I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do. But I had to think of something quick.\r  \n\r  \nIn the meantime, everyone at school was already excited about prom. I wasn\u2019t. I had gotten myself caught up in some debt. Prom was the last thing I cared about. \r  \n\r  \nDuring the next few weeks that\u2019s all everyone at school discussed. My parents even brought it up to me, expressing how they hoped I planned on going to the last prom of high school. At first I disregarded their suggestion and didn\u2019t plan on going. I had no one to take. I was pretty sure anyone I asked would\u2019ve turned me down anyways. But to my surprise, someone asked me to prom instead.\r  \n\r  \nA girl named Alexis. This was odd because I hadn\u2019t interacted with her much over the years, and I barely knew her. But she told me she had no one to take to prom and she\u2019s been checking me out for some time. So reluctantly, I agreed to go to prom with her. Afterwards, we spent some time hanging out and dating off and on. Some mornings I\u2019d even pick her up and give her rides to school in my car.\r  \n\r  \nOne morning Abatha caught Alexis and I getting out of my car and heading to the school building. Abatha was standing alone once again. This time she was scrolling away on her phone. She spotted us out in the parking lot, then waited for us to approach her. Another mischievous grin plastered her face.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cLooks like the troublemaker caught himself another fish,\u201d Abatha said as we passed by.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I didn\u2019t reply, Abatha stepped out in front of us and blocked our way.\r  \n\r  \nI sighed.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAbatha, not today\u201d.\r  \n\r  \nI had to look up to her as I spoke.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI don\u2019t wanna get into it with you right now. Please move,\u201d I continued.\r  \n\r  \nI took Alexis by the hand and tried to move around her but she just blocked me again.\r  \n\r  \nAbatha did this often. I\u2019ve had many girlfriends throughout high school. Every time Abatha saw me with a new girl she\u2019d come and embarrass me in front of my date.\r  \n \r  \nEvery time.\r  \n\r  \nI sighed again. Abatha chuckled.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Jakey boy?...still feelin\u2019 butterflies?\u201d Abatha taunted.\r  \n\r  \nShe glanced at Alexis.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cLet me ask you something,\u201d Abatha continued, stepping closer to Alexis, \u201cDoes he often get\u2026jittery, when you\u2019re alone?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s any of your busine - \u201c Alexis started.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDoes he scream when you see him with his pants down?\u201d Abatha interrupted,  \u201cOnly asking because he did it before. When I pulled his pants down back in sixth grade\u2026..wait, have you seen him with his pants down yet?\u201d \r  \n\r  \nAgitated, Alexis took me by the hand and made her way around Abatha, pulling me along with her. As we trotted along, I glanced back and saw Abatha frowning. I smirked at her as we walked further away. Abatha rolled her eyes in frustration before turning around and going in the opposite direction.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI was just getting off work on one Saturday night, as my shift had just ended. My manager was counting the till and I just cleaned the last table in the restaurant. While I waited by the door for the manager to lock up for the night, I saw a black truck pull into the parking lot outside. The truck parked right beside my car. My guess was a last minute customer. Evidently my manager thought the same because he told me to tell whoever was in the truck that we were closed. When they came to the door, that is. But no one ever did get out of the truck. About ten minutes had passed by and they were still sitting there letting the engine run.\r  \n\r  \nMy manager and I stepped outside after he had set the alarm and finished the till. Then the both of us went our separate ways in the parking lot, after the manager had locked the restaurant doors.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I got to my car I tried to sneak a peek into the truck that was parked beside me but the windows were tinted very dark.\r  \n\r  \nGo figure.\r  \n\r  \nI heard the manager start the engine on his car and pull out of the parking lot. That\u2019s when a door on the mysterious black truck suddenly shot open. A large man hopped out of the back seat and grabbed me from behind, hauling me into the truck afterwards.\r  \n\r  \nAs soon as the large man threw me into the back seat, I was reminded that I had told Bucky-Mac where I worked when we first met. I told him part of my schedule, and gave some specifics on times. I had also informed him of some other things I couldn\u2019t recall at the moment. I know I may have told him a little too much but the guy seemed so friendly at first I thought I could trust him.\r  \n\r  \nThe guy that hauled me in pushed me further across the seat, before getting back in himself and closing the door. Someone else in the truck flipped on a light. Then I could clearly see Bucky-Mac sitting right beside me. He didn\u2019t look happy.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSup, Jake?\u201d He said. \r  \n\r  \nHe stared at me with cold and menacing eyes.\r  \n\r  \nThere were two guys in the front. They were looking back at me, holding expressions similar to Bucky-Mac\u2019s.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou\u2019ve missed some payments, and it better be for good reason. Now, I hope you have cash to cover these couple weeks you\u2019ve decided to skedaddle,\u201d Bucky-Mac said.\r  \n\r  \nHe continued to glare at me, waiting for a response.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI-I\u2019ve been trying to get the money. What do you think I\u2019m at this restaurant for?\u201d I stammered.\r  \n\r  \nHe snickered then covered his face with his hand.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNow, that\u2019s a good one!.....But it\u2019s still unacceptable. You haven\u2019t been paying, and you\u2019ve been ignoring my calls,\u201d he snarled.\r  \n\r  \nHe elbowed me in the face, striking me right in my nose.  My nose began to gush blood.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the guys up front lit a cigarette, then that\u2019s when Bucky-Mac and the large guy sitting on my other side started to viciously beat me. They kicked my ass in that back seat for minutes, then the large guy opened the door again before shoving me outside on the ground.\r  \n\r  \nThe black truck backed up and took off, leaving me behind in the moonlit parking lot.\r  \n\r  \nMy entire body was aching like hell, and one of my eyes throbbed non-stop. I touched my bottom lip. It was swollen, and felt slightly enlarged. I could barely stand up straight heading to my car, as the pain had caused my body to beg for rest.\r  \n\r  \nAs I opened my car door, I heard something from a distance. A strange sound. Like a howl. It was echoing out into the night, and it went on for seconds. I turned in all directions making several attempts at finding the source. \r  \n\r  \nI found nothing.\r  \n\r  \nI even glanced at the sky. There was nothing there but the half moon.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI had dug myself deeper into the debt hole by not visiting Bucky-Mac for those two weeks. He increased my debt even more, and accounted for the times I didn\u2019t show up. As expected, he doubled the amount for each week. This meant I owed him a total of eight thousand dollars as of the night in the parking lot.\r  \n\r  \nAfter that I made sure I stopped by Bucky-Mac\u2019s spot and paid him as much as I could for the following few weeks after, even though it was nowhere near enough. As a result of the low payments, I received more beatings everytime I went. But I had to keep going and pay him what I could, otherwise he\u2019d do something worse if I didn\u2019t show up at all.\r  \n\r  \nBut what was I kidding. I was never going to pay off this debt. At this point I realized that\u2019s exactly how Bucky-Mac wanted things. He wanted a constant flow of cash that never ended. Even if I showed up to his office one day and paid what I owed in full, he\u2019d just double the debt and kick my ass again.\r  \n\r  \nThe beatings were getting unbearable. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. So I felt I had to skip out on him for a couple more weeks as a way to catch a break from getting my ass kicked.  Again I ignored his calls when he hit up my cell phone. After that I just anticipated the black truck waiting for me outside of my job.\r  \n\r  \nBucky-Mac didn\u2019t show up at my job anymore. He came to my school instead. After the bell rang and the school day came to an end, fear showered me when I walked outside and saw the black truck parked across the street. \r  \n\r  \nI planned on giving Alexis a ride home that day, so she was by my side as I tried to ease my way to my car. Unfortunately I was spotted as I crawled into the driver\u2019s seat. The backdoor on the black truck swung open, then that same large guy from before came trotting across the street. When the guy approached my car, he swung my door back open then gently pulled me out of the driver\u2019s seat.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cJake, where are you going?\u201d Alexis said, \u201cWho is this?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe guy held his arm on my shoulder as he walked me across the street to the black truck. He faked a smile and pretended to be an acquaintance to avoid drawing the attention of the nearby students around us. We got to the truck then the guy shoved me into the back seat once again.\r  \n\r  \nI met Bucky-Mac with an unsettled gaze the second I was thrown in. I could hear Alexis constantly shouting my name outside.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI thought I wouldn\u2019t have to tell you again,\u201d Bucky-Mac mumbled, \u201cBut it looks like you\u2019re a pretty terrible listener!\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWith that, the guy up front started to slowly drive away from the school. I glanced out the window and saw Alexis jogging on the sidewalk to keep up with us. The truck made a stop after a block of cruising. They parked near a curb closeby.\r  \n\r  \nAnother beating was initiated, and I can tell you this was the worst one yet. They gave me double the amount of blows to my body. I received so many strikes to the face I was surprised I could see at all when it was over.\r  \n\r  \nAlexis peeped through the window with her hands cupped around her eyes, yelling for them to stop.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cStop it, you\u2019re gonna hurt him!\u201d she cried.\r  \n\r  \nThey kept going, punching and elbowing me for minutes. I could feel blood elevating my throat.\r  \n\r  \nBucky-Mac drew a knife and held it to my pupil. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cListen here you little shit. The next time you screw me over, not only are we gonna beat you twice as worse and twice as longer, but I\u2019m gonna take my blade\u2026and pluck one of your eyes,\u201d He threatened.\r  \n\r  \nHe brought the blade even closer to my eye. Almost to the point where I could almost feel the tip touching my eyeball.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou can\u2019t afford to test me again, Jake.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI was shoved out of the truck once more, only to be meant with Alexis crying on the sidewalk. The panic on her face grew more intense when she saw my nose dripping with blood.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cJake, what\u2019s going on?\u201d she sobbed.\r  \n\r  \nI didn\u2019t answer. \r  \n\r  \nSomeone else was walking towards us on the sidewalk. It was Abatha. She saw Alexis crying, then glanced at me. As soon as she saw my battered face there was an expression of concern.\r  \n\r  \nAbatha wasn\u2019t smiling.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAlexis broke up with me the next day. She got spooked by the incident and decided she didn\u2019t want much to do with me anymore. Our plans to go to prom together were also canceled. The incident had given Alexis the wrong impression - that I was still engaging in pathological behavior. She complained of not being able to be around me anymore, saying, \r  \n\r  \n\u201cSo these are the kind of people you deal with?!...If that\u2019s the case, then I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re not gonna work.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nShe walked away then barely spoke to me anymore after that. Then of course Abatha just had to be nearby to witness and overhear everything. Abatha was already holding her usual grin when I glanced at her.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cLooks like you messed up again, Jakey boy!\u201d She teased, \u201cYour fish unhooked itself and swam away?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI glared at her angrily, then brushed past her to enter the school building.\r  \n\r  \nIt was pretty disappointing for our plans to be canceled. But hell, my whole ideal ending for my senior year had been canceled as far as I knew. Just when I was starting to grow more enthusiastic about senior prom all hope was taken away. Prom was just a month and a half away and I no longer had a date to take. To make matters worse, Alexis had already found another prom date within days after splitting up with me.\r  \n\r  \nAbatha wouldn\u2019t shut up about that. She rubbed it in face for days.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWell that was quick. We\u2019ll see how fast you can find another date\u2026if at all,\u201d she said before trailing away, giggling.\r  \n\r  \nI lifted a middle finger at her as she walked.\r  \n\r  \nAt this point in time I no longer cared about the car. I wished I could return it and take back everything. I just wanted out of this debt with Bucky-Mac, and for senior year to just end already. I was giving up on all hopes for my plans for the future. As a matter of fact, after being too afraid to face Bucky-Mac once again and skipping out on meeting him for another three weeks, I decided that I\u2019d contact the police and inform them of the situation I\u2019d gotten myself in soon. Then let my parents know what was going on. \r  \n\r  \nI was sure my parents would definitely kick me out after finding out I made a deal with a loan shark. But I didn\u2019t care. Keeping a secret wasn\u2019t worth my life. Or in this case - my eye.\r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately I made the fatal mistake of not acting on those thoughts soon enough, as I ended another night shift at work with the black truck waiting for me out in the parking lot. My heart leaped instantly as I felt my body run cold. I wanted badly to just tell my manager everything and beg him to call the police for me. But instead all he did was activate the security system and lock the doors as usual. Then he pulled out of the parking lot, leaving me to endure what was to come. \r  \n\r  \nThe black truck pulled out of its parking spot and made its way over to me. That same large guy hopped out and started to haul me into the truck.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cGet his ass in here!!\u201d I heard Bucky-Mac hiss.\r  \n\r  \nWe all heard something. Then the large guy holding me paused.\r  \n\r  \nIt was the same howling sound I heard before. Again it echoed out into the night, and got louder the longer it went on.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d The large guy said.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWho gives a shit?!! Get him in!\u201d Bucky-Mac demanded.\r  \n\r  \nThe large guy did just that.\r  \n\r  \nThis time instead of giving me the usual beating quickie, they pulled off as soon as I was hauled into the truck and drove me back to Bucky-Mac\u2019s spot. The truck halted at a stop upon arriving at the small raggedy house.\r  \n\r  \nThis was my first time at the spot during the night, and it looked a bit different. There was no kind of artificial light in this wooded area so it was a lot darker than usual. But the light from the full moon above provided enough to see around the dark pit that surrounded us.\r  \n\r  \nThe men shoved me out of the truck and started their beating ritual. The other two men joined in this time, punching and kicking me, barely giving me a chance to breathe. In the middle of all this was the sound of the howling again.\r  \n\r  \nThe large guy was the only one to acknowledge it. He paused, but Bucky-Mac and the other two continued to beat me.\r  \n\r  \nAfter minutes of receiving many more blows, they all stopped. The large guy positioned my body to lean against the back tire of the truck. Then Bucky-Mac drew his pocket knife and kneeled down to face me.\r  \n\r  \nI moaned and groaned from the painful sensations moving throughout my body.\r  \n\r  \n\"I tried,\" Bucky-Mac started, \"I've really tried to work with you. But it's obvious you're a fraud.\"\r  \n\r  \nHe had some nerve. The loan shark, calling me a fraud.\r  \n\r  \n\"I think you get a kick out of not giving me what I want\u2026what I deserve.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nHe opened the blade on the knife and brought the point to my eye.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNow I\u2019m gonna take something away you desperately want\u2026.and don\u2019t deserve,\u201d he continued.\r  \n\r  \nI swore I could feel the tip of the blade slightly drive into my sclera. Before it could go any deeper, we all heard that howl for the third time that night. Except it sounded very close this time. So close no one could ignore it. Not even Bucky-Mac.  He lowered the knife then glanced behind him, as that\u2019s where it seemed the howling came from.\r  \n\r  \nThere was nothing there but a patch of darkness resting between the trees.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat the - ?\u201d Bucky-mac whispered.\r  \n\r  \nAs we all stared at the patch of darkness, two glowing dots emerged in front of our eyes. \r  \n\r  \nTwo yellow glowing dots.\r  \n\r  \nBehind the yellow dots came another howl, along with some deep and beastly growls.\r  \n\r  \nThe dots started to come closer, then continued until whatever was hiding in the shadows came out into view, and was exposed beneath the moonlight.\r  \n\r  \nThe sight of the creature we were looking at had caught us all off guard. Bucky-Mac dropped the knife then all five of us began backing away.\r  \n\r  \nIn front of us was some kind of tall and fury beast. The creature stood upright just like a human, and had to be no less than seven feet tall. Its muscles were so defined they practically rippled through its black and shiny coat of fur. Turns out the yellow dots were the creature\u2019s eyes. Those beady eyes were locked on us, as we backed away even further.\r  \n\r  \nThe creature opened its long snout full of pointed teeth, dripping with saliva, and let out a deafening, monstrous sound.\r  \n\r  \n\"Bucky, what the hell is going on?!\" One of the other guys shouted.\r  \n\r  \n\"H-how the fuck should I know?\" Bucky-Mac yelled.\r  \n\r  \nI could hear the fear and concern in their voices.\r  \n\r  \nThe creature let out several smaller growls, then suddenly began sprinting towards us on all fours. Bucky-Mac and his guys drew pistols and began firing multiple shots at the hairy beast.\r  \n\r  \nI turned to run but instantly tripped and fell on my stomach. The sharp pain in my stomach left me stagnant for seconds. \r  \n\r  \nBullets struck the creature in several areas on its muscular body. The gunfire seemed to do little to no damage, but it was enough to keep the creature temporarily distant. The beast backed off then started to crawl up the walls of Bucky-Mac\u2019s small drug house. The men continued to fire at the creature until it reached the roof.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cCome on, kill this fuckin\u2019 thing!\u201d Bucky-Mac shouted, firing away with his revolver.\r  \n\r  \nWith many bullets still striking its body, the creature took a huge leap off the building. It jumped so high I could see the full moon behind it\u2019s body as it accelerated through the air - towards us. It landed right on top of the guy who drove the truck, crushing his puny human body and taking a huge bite out of his head afterwards. Blood sprayed from the exposed brains in his skull, dousing his partner in the face nearby and preventing him from seeing where he was shooting.\r  \n\r  \nThe guy screamed and tried to flee the area. He could barely turn around before the creature took one of its paws and ran its razor sharp claws across his face, slicing one of his eyes in the process and leaving three gruesome gashes behind.\r  \n\r  \nShocked, Bucky-Mac dropped his gun and watched the creature lift his disfigured partner off the ground and pull one his arms clean off his body. The guy screamed in agony as his stump cascaded with blood and fell to the ground like a waterfall. He wiggled and twitched in pain, making several feeble attempts at breaking free of the creature\u2019s grasp.\r  \n\r  \nBucky-Mac turned and started to flee. The big guy followed behind him, dashing right past me, and leaving me alone with the beast.\r  \n\r  \nThe creature turned and started to stare at me with those yellow eyes, still holding Bucky-Mac\u2019s mangled partner in its hand. The fear and terror left me paralyzed. I couldn\u2019t move.\r  \n\r  \nI started to feel a little light headed, and keeping my eyes open became difficult.\r  \n\r  \nThe last thing I remembered before I passed out, was those glowing eyes and those sharp canines dripping with crimson.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nWhen I woke up I couldn\u2019t tell how much time had passed. I stood up and scanned the area, only to see the truck still beside me. The mangled bodies of the driver and passenger of the truck were laid out not too far away. But Bucky-Mac and the large guy were nowhere to be found.\r  \n\r  \nThe creature had disappeared too.\r  \n\r  \nI wasted no time. Right away I started to run, trying to make my way out of that neck of the woods. While darting through the trees, I came across two more bodies, one slumped on its side and the other on its back.\r  \n\r  \nI ran to one of the bodies and rolled it over using my foot. I almost screamed when I saw the face. It was Bucky-Mac, and he was unrecognizable. His face had been completely torn away, leaving nothing behind but his exposed and bleeding face muscles. His mouth was slightly open. Opened wide enough for me to see his one gold tooth.\r  \n\r  \nThe large guy\u2019s torso had been torn open, his body sprawled out, eyes staring out into nothing but the darkness that surrounded him. Dried blood was caked all over his face and neck.\r  \n\r  \nI heard some growls.\r  \n\r  \nThis caused me to start running again. I got a glimpse of a pair of yellow eyes hiding in the middle of some trees as I passed by. I ran faster. Then I heard multiple footsteps behind me.\r  \n\r  \nIt was following me.\r  \n\r  \nI made it out of the woods and reached a street light out on the road, where I sat down on the curb and took some time to catch my breath. I didn\u2019t hear the footsteps anymore so I assumed I was safe. I also glanced behind me again and saw nothing pursuing me.\r  \n\r  \nThat thing had all the time in the world to maul me to bits. It could\u2019ve easily caught me while I was running\u2026so why didn\u2019t it?\r  \n\r  \nFor some reason I still felt a bit light headed. I rested my head on my hand. But while doing so I felt a rough substance on my forehead. I brought my finger to my face to see what I had touched. Something blue and dry.\r  \n\r  \nLipstick.\r  \n\r  \nSomeone kissed me.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nMy parents wondered where I was and wanted to know why I was getting home so late that night. I lied and said I went to a party after work. They were a bit upset that I didn't call and let them know what was going on. I was fine with that. I was just glad to be alive, and for the first time since forever I was happy to see them.\r  \n\r  \nIt was that night I realized I would be just fine staying with my parents for a while longer. I also decided that I had no problem working at the burger joint until I figured out what I really wanted out of life, and college just may be a possibility in the future.\r  \n\r  \nI continued to faithfully show up to work and complete my shifts, and wait patiently for my senior year to come to an end.\r  \n\r  \nMeanwhile, the authorities found Bucky-Mac and his men. Then they raided his drug house. No one could identify the cause of their deaths, or tell whether another animal or human was responsible. The story was all over the news, and it had people in town shook. Everyone kept talking about the gruesome killings until the end of the school year. Who or what might have done it was always up for debate.\r  \n\r  \nTo this day, no one knows that I was there to see it all. I always got uneasy overhearing someone at school talk about it.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nTwo weeks before prom I opened my locker to see a pink envelope lying on top of my books. I picked it up and saw Abatha's name written across the front. While tearing open the envelope I sighed and rolled my eyes, expecting to see something crude and belligerent.\r  \n\r  \nThere was a folded letter inside, and upon opening it my eyes went wide. My heart started racing, and I was shocked to my core.  At the very top of the page was an imprint of lips with\u2026\r  \n\r  \nBlue lipstick.\r  \n\r  \nBelow that was a lengthy letter from Abatha, explaining how she really felt about me. How she's felt for a long time. In the last paragraph was something else that left me perplexed.\r  \n\r  \nShe was asking me out, and she wanted to be my girlfriend.\r  \n\r  \nShe..she also wanted to take me to prom.",

    "postText": "This subreddit might not be the right place for my story, but I just experienced a fundamental fracture in reality. And now I really want some comforting comments. Tell me I hallucinated the entire thing. I wouldn\u2019t believe you, but you could try.\n\nI invited some friends to my parents\u2019 house, and we were chilling in the garden. Sitting on rickety deck chairs. Blasting Alt-J through a tinny Alexa speaker. Nursing canned cider that Dad bought for us. I often try to be aware that I\u2019m a socially-inept, acne-ridden teen. But knowing yourself to be something doesn\u2019t make it any less true. My impulses often get the best of me.\n\nAnd that was what happened during a game of Dare/Spin the Bottle last weekend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s you, Lila!\u201d I cackled. \u201cAnd the dare is that\u2026 you\u2019ve got to kiss John.\u201d\n\nLila turned bright red. \u201cI didn\u2019t really wanna play this game, Mike.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoo!\u201d John cried, pursing his lips. \u201cGive me a smooch.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be arseholes, guys,\u201d Katie groaned. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to kiss John, and I don\u2019t blame her.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the rule!\u201d I said, laughing callously. \u201cOr would you rather go home, Lila?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m deeply ashamed of that emotional manipulation. Lila is a reserved, introverted person with deeply-rooted anxiety, and I used that to my advantage. There was no way she could refuse. She wouldn\u2019t want to be kicked out of the group.\n\nFor a fleeting moment, tears filled her eyes, and I felt a piercing pang of guilt. She leaned in to kiss John, and then a terrifying thing happened.\n\nTime halted.\n\nOr, rather, my friends halted. The tree leaves and grass strands continued to flutter in the ever-quickening gusts of howling wind.\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 Guys?\u201d I whispered, frightfully clambering to my feet and waving my hands in front of their frozen faces.\n\nThen I heard a distorted chuckle, which sounded eerily like my own, and my neck hairs stood to attention. Other than the whistling wind, the laugh was the only sound in that haunting realm.\n\nI spun around to face the back of my garden, and I saw a shape behind the fence. Something was peering through the gaps between the panels. I saw an eye \u2014 almost human, but far too wide and stretched horribly out of shape.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s you, Mike,\u201d A petrifying voice taunted, parroting my own words.\n\nI screamed as the figure squeezed itself through the fence panels, slithering its misshapen, half-human body into my garden. And there, standing at the edge of the lawn, pointing a gnarled finger at me, was a jumbled version of Lila. Limbs disfigured, one eye larger than the other, and crooked, colourless lips.\n\nI turned to view the real Lila, who was still stuck in time, and then I returned my gaze to the smiling monstrosity that was slinking towards me.\n\n\u201cAnd the dare is that\u2026 you must remove a finger, Mike,\u201d The horror wheezed in an inhuman voice. \u201cIt\u2019s the rule.\u201d\n\nExistential dread consumed me. I was certain that it must be a psychotic break, born from guilt of what I\u2019d done to my friend. I still would believe that, were it not for what happened next.\n\nLila\u2019s spectre seized me by the neck and hoisted me from the ground. I shrieked, gazing into the eyes of the girl\u2019s embodied trauma. A malevolent demon of my own creation.\n\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d I begged, choking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the rule!\u201d Lila bellowed.\n\nWith unnaturally long, sharp fingernails, the creature tore at the flesh on my chest. I walked in excruciating pain at the deep gashes, which released pools of blood into my shirt.\n\n\u201cOr would you rather go\u2026 home?\u201d Lila asked, looking down and cackling.\n\nThe lawn caved inwards, revealing an endless void beneath the surface of the Earth. Lila hurled me to the grass and smiled, laughing as I crawled away from the ever-expanding hole in the ground.\n\nWailing, and terrified beyond measure, I took a look at my left pinky finger and wondered how I could remove it to free myself of that frozen nightmare. The searing pain from the claw marks on my chest made it difficult to think coherently.\n\nIn a moment of insanity, driven by a primal urge to survive, I placed my pinky finger in my mouth. I thought of something I\u2019d heard about the strength of the human jaw. We can tear through flesh and bone with our teeth. It\u2019s possible. But it\u2019s a question of mentality, rather than physicality.\n\nI bit.\n\nI could attempt to describe the pain, but words would be insufficient. I nearly blacked out, and all I remember is Lila\u2019s ghoul grinning at me with those haunting eyes as my pinky tore free from my hand.\n\nAnd then my friends were screaming.\n\n\u201cMike?\u201d John yelled, jumping to his feet. \u201cHow did you get over there in the space of a second?\u201d\n\nThey ran over to my bloodied, mangled body several yards away.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck happened to him?\u201d Katie screeched. \u201cCall an ambulance!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how I know I didn\u2019t imagine it. And Lila looked just as perplexed as the rest of my friends. I truly believe she had nothing to do with what happened. I think reality broke for a moment. Her pain caused it.\n\nI caused it.\n\nWhatever the case, I learned something on my 18th birthday:\n\nActions have consequences, even when others don\u2019t see them.\n\nLila hid her pain, but that didn\u2019t make it any less real. I saw the terror within her mind.\n\nI apologised to my friend, and I pray I\u2019ve fixed the glitch in reality. I pray her fractured self never haunts me again.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

You\u2019re right, OP\u2014 making someone do something they don\u2019t want to know under threat of social isolation was disgusting of you. Hopefully she never comes back for you.",

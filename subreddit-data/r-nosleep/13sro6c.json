You can look it up for yourself, but I can give you the short version if you\u2019d like.\r  \n\n\nIn England during the 70s and 80s, there was a special number you could call from a red telephone box around Burnley in Lancashire.  A few people said you needed to dial a series of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 0s, while at least one other comment in a different thread suggested you had to tap the receiver a bunch of times to send an analog signal.  Whatever it was, some people claim that once you\u2019d dialled correctly, you\u2019d get through to a woman, talking in a stern, monotone voice.  By some accounts, she would say a couple different things, but everyone who said they\u2019d called this number agreed she\u2019d said one phrase over and over again.\r  \n\n\nHelp Me.  Help Me.  Susie\u2019s Dying.\r  \n\n\nI remember being quite intrigued by the story.  I was a fan of creepy things at the time (I think I was a teenager), and the idea of a number where all you\u2019d hear is a woman saying\r  \n\n\nHelp Me.  Help Me.  Susie\u2019s Dying.\r  \n\n\nseemed plausible enough to be real.  I think I may have chatted to a friend about it, and we concluded that it was probably some test by the phone company.  We never tried calling the number, though.  There wasn\u2019t a phone box in my village.  At least I don\u2019t think there was.  I can\u2019t remember my friend\u2019s name.\r  \n\n\nThat story, the\r  \n\n\nHelp Me.  Help Me.  Suzie\u2019s Dying.\r  \n\n\nstory, is one of the few things I have that reminds me I had a life before this.  I went online, I made friends, I lived in a village of some kind, somewhere.  Maybe I lived in Burnley?  I don\u2019t know.  In some ways, it\u2019s easier not to think about that stuff, since it just reminds me that I\u2019ve lost something, although I feel I lack even a remote sense of what I have lost.  Sometimes, I almost wish I was afraid, wish I was still able to conceive of a life beyond this place.  Was I kidnapped?  I know I didn\u2019t choose to be here, but did I really have a choice to begin with?  It makes me tired to think about.  Everything makes me tired, actually.\r  \n\n\nHelp Me.  Help Me.  Susie\u2019s Dying.\r  \n\n\nI was driving, I know that much.  It was a dark country road, and I remember the grey leaves forming a tunnel for me as I sped along.  I know I was driving, because I was alone, and I was clutching a wheel covered in a slightly sticky black leather.  There is a smell in the air, possibly cigarettes.\r  \n\n\nWhere was I going?  How old was I?  Susie\u2019s Dying.\r  \n\n\nThere is nothing much on my mind.  The radio is on, playing the same song over and over again.  The song is about love, or about a series of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 0s.  Everything is normal until I see the flash of something pale, an arm, or a leg, and I quickly slam on the breaks and with a violent jolt I stop, my heart pounding and my hands gripping the wheel even tighter than before.  In front of me, just outside the range of the headlights, I see a small figure.  It looks like a girl, possibly five or six.  She is wearing a puffy white dress, like the kind you\u2019d wear to a wedding.\r  \n\n\nHow do I know all this?  Help Me.  How do I know all this?\r  \n\n\nShe was standing upright, stiff like a mannequin.  Her arms and legs were bare, and I remember thinking how cold she looked, just standing in the middle of the road at night.  Her face was small like a button, all white with what looked like tears rolling down her cheeks and staining her white dress.  She was sobbing.  I should have known, but she was \r  \n\n\nDying.\r  \n\n\nall alone.  How could I leave her alone?  It was cold and dark, and I\u2019d nearly run her over.  I needed to\r  \n\n\nHelp Her.\r  \n\n\nI took off my seatbelt and got out the car.  I said something, asked her something, I think I asked her for her name?  I smiled, because I wanted to \r  \n\n\nHelp Me.\r  \n\n\nreassure her.  She wouldn\u2019t move, though, she was still and stared at me and her eyes were weeping but there was something off about them.  I got closer.  I told her my name was\r  \n\n\nSusie\r  \n\n\nand I asked if she know where her parents where.  I didn\u2019t know what to do, and I was starting to feel very afraid.  I wanted to call\r  \n*a number - I think it was made up of zeros, twos and ones - and without needing to insert two pence*\r  \n\n\nall the while she just stood there.  I got closer and closer, and I realized that even though she was crying, the little girl\u2019s face had no expression whatsoever.  Her mouth was just a straight line like the kind drawn with a marker pen, and her eyes weren\u2019t looking at me but were just staring forward like glass beads, even as the tears poured and poured and poured onto her white dress.  She was sobbing, but she wasn\u2019t\r  \n\n\nWhat wasn\u2019t she?  Help Me.  Susie\u2019s Dying.\r  \n\n\nThe next thing I remember was a great pain, greater than anything I\u2019ve ever known or can know.  It hit me on the head and travelled down me.  I fell to the ground and couldn\u2019t get up.  She was still there.  It was her and wasn\u2019t her.  She wasn\u2019t there.  I wasn\u2019t there.  I think I screamed out, called for help.  I needed help for me and this child I\u2019d found.  I could barely open my eyes, I was so tired all of a sudden.  I slept and woke and slept and woke and woke and now I\u2019m here, and I\u2019ve been here ever since.\r  \nThat\u2019s the last thing I remember.\n\nWas it a day ago?  An hour?  A year?  Was it even real, I don\u2019t know.  Thinking about it makes me tired.  I\u2019m just so tired.  It\u2019s cold in here, and despite my best efforts, I cannot sleep.  I have to watch the phones.  The phones are important, they are all red and shiny.  I must watch the phones, and I am happy to do it because if I don\u2019t there\u2019ll be no-one to look after her.  She needs help, she is all alone and cold and sobbing.  I must watch the phones and pray that someone calls me, so I can get us both the help we need.  I do not know the number, have any of you hear of this number?  If you know it, please give me a ring.  Please give me a ring.  She needs our help.  Give me a ring.  Give me a ring.  Give me a ring.

It was smashed up and had graffiti all over it, but I don't think that's related to the note.  Probably some arg or whatever, but still pretty interesting.  What do you guys think?",

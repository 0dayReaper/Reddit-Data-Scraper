    "postText": "Part 3\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13u95d4/ive\\_been\\_able\\_to\\_hear\\_the\\_voices\\_of\\_ghosts\\_for/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\n\nThe musk was the first thing I sensed after I came to. The mildew and humid, heavy air that filled my mouth and lungs. The second thing were the handcuffs holding my wrists together in front of me.\n\nSoon afterwards, I was jolted upright by the vicious barking of the dog gnashing its teeth at me. I slid quickly to the brick wall, putting myself as flat against it as possible.\n\nThe german shepherd yanked at its rusty chain leash to get to me. Pulling and pulling and pulling at the thick PVC pipe it was tied to. I begged for it not to break.\n\nThe snarls of the dog and the clanking of metal were not the only sounds, however. The basement was also filled with the bellowing and overlapping cries and calls of countless spirits. The voices of so many men and women whose ghostly forms were tied to this cold, stinking space. Every spirit that I had never heard in town was clearly trapped here.\n\n\u201cTRACER! SHUT UP!\u201d\n\nI heard the heavy footfalls of a single individual on the floor above me. The dog, Tracer, stopped his barking but kept his teeth bared. He licked his lips as I heard a door somewhere in the room open and descending footsteps creaking at old wooden stairs.\n\n\u201cAre you awake?\u201d Haines asked, before he rounded the corner to see me.\n\nWe made eye contact and he grinned at me. The ghostly wails continued. They filled my brain with layers upon layers of crying and yelling. Constant barrages of sound so that I could hardly think.\n\n\u201cFUCKING SHUT UP!\u201d I screamed with every ounce of ferocity my voice could manage, but the voices did not stop.\n\nHaines began to laugh even as I said,\n\n\u201cNot you. The ghosts. The damn ghosts. Shut up, for the love of God.\u201d\n\nHaines continued his snickering, but the otherworldly sounds began to fade.\n\n\u201cYou're losing it much faster than the others,\u201d Haines taunted. \u201cYou\u2019re already crazy.\u201d\n\nI managed to calm myself even as the spirits muttered amongst themselves. I closed my eyes and tilted my head up to the ceiling.\n\n\u201cYou have to help me. The ghosts of this house, please, you have to help me.\u201d\n\nAs I looked back down at the officer, his face filled with equal parts bemusement and disbelief.\n\n\u201cI think the fumes got to you, girlie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not crazy. You are the fucking crazy one.\u201d \n\nI shook the cuffs at him to emphasize my point. Haines chuckled, rubbing his hairy paws together.\n\n\u201cWhat are you gonna do to me?\u201d\n\nThe ghosts began to rile up slightly but listened to me when I again told them to be quiet.\n\n\u201cWow. Gotta say this is the strangest kidnapping so far.\u201d\n\nHe sat down on the floor across from me, petting the fur coat of his canine, killing companion. The dog never broke its gaze with me, nor did the bloodlust leave its eyes.\n\n\u201cWhen my babygirl gets back home, we\u2019re gonna kill ya, doll. We\u2019re gonna do it slow. You know. Have fun with it. Enjoy our date night.\u201d\n\nMy eyes darted from the hairy beast and back to the german shepherd which gnashed at me once.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah he\u2019s gonna get a taste too. He likes the hunt whenever we go on the trails, but that\u2019s a little riskier than just feeding him at home. He didn\u2019t even get to finish last time before you stumbled across Alice\u2019s body.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were still there?\u201d\n\nHaines snorted. \u201cCourse we were. If you hadn\u2019t darted out of there so quick, you probably woulda seen us standing in the tree line watching you.\u201d\n\nMy stomach churned. I had been so close to death so many times without knowing it.\n\n\u201cWhy did you wait so long to come after me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t gonna. Don\u2019t usually like to kill so fast after the last one, but\u2026 well you seemed kinda off in your interrogation. Seemed like you were holding back. Talked about it like a murder and we had to make sure you didn\u2019t see us. My girl was sure you did, that\u2019s why she dyed her hair.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see you, though. I only saw red. Everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen how\u2019d you know?\u201d\n\nI mulled over my answer for a moment, but since he already thought I was crazy and since I had nothing to lose, I answered truthfully.\n\n\u201cAlice told me. I spoke to her ghost when it followed me down the mountain.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, really? Is she here now?\u201d\n\nI heard a distinct *Yes* among the chatter of spirits.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nI won\u2019t lie to you. When she said that I felt a little bit better.\n\n\u201cThen at least you\u2019ve got company,\u201d he said with a smile. He stood up and rounded the corner mumbling, \u201cSchizo,\u201d before ascending the steps.\n\nThe second the door closed behind Haines, the ghosts began to shout again.\n\n\u201cStop. Please, Christ. Alice. Only let Alice talk right now.\u201d\n\nAfter the clammer faded I heard the faintest *hello...*\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Alice. I\u2019m not mad, okay. Just\u2026 just help me please. I helped you, you help me.\u201d\n\n*What can I do?*\n\nI had to think for a moment. What could she do? What could any of them do?\n\n\u201cGo upstairs. Keep an eye out and give me a warning if you see anything.\u201d\n\nShe agreed, leaving me in the basement surrounded by spirits and an angry hound. I placed my cuffed hands together to my forehead trying desperately to think.\n\n**May I speak,** said a deep melodious voice from the ether. It was one that I hadn\u2019t heard yet.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n**I was a police officer,** the voice continued. **I started catching on to what those two were up to, but I wasn\u2019t able to stop them before\u2026 well. But forget that. I can help you out some. Do you have a bobby pin in your hair?**\n\nThe question snapped me to attention. I quickly ruffled through my messy hair to eventually find and pull out a single bobby pin.\n\n**Perfect!**\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\n**Okay, listen close. Do you know how to use that to get out of those cuffs? Don\u2019t worry, that's okay. Some drifter got out of mine once using this trick and I\u2019ve learned how to do it. I need you to flatten out that pin.**\n\n\u201cDone.\u201d\n\n**Do you have some slack in the cuffs?**\n\n\u201cA little bit.\u201d\n\n**Awesome, now listen. I need you to slip that pin into the cuffs where the hinge piece inserts to the base. Shove it in there. Now squeeze them tighter. Let it click a few times.**\n\n\u201cIt worked,\u201d I said in disbelief as the cuff fell off completely. I quickly undid the other side.\n\nUnfortunately, as I began to work, Tracer got the hint that something was wrong and his snarling increased. Just as the second cuff was off the snarling turned to barking.\n\n\u201cTracer!\u201d I heard from the top floor. \u201cTracer, shut up!\u201d\n\nThe steps once again moved towards the door. Alice screamed at me that he was going straight for the basement.\n\n\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d\n\n**Into that room! Quick! You\u2019ll find some weapons in there.**\n\nI hurried into the only sectioned off room in the entire basement and locked the door. The scene on the other side was horrific. A blood stained wooden table was in the center. Five leather straps were located in spots that indicated one for each limb plus an extra for the neck.\n\nAlong the wall was a large rolling toolbox equally smeared in dry brown blotches. I rummaged through the drawers as quickly as I could. Haines screamed in the background and so too did the spirits.\n\nPounding and slamming and screams and wails. All order ceased. The voices overflowed once again. I grabbed a black metal hammer from the toolbox just as the burly man broke the door off its hinges with a final kick.\n\nI swung but he leaned backwards to avoid it then lunged back in to grab me by the throat. He knocked the hammer from my grip. As it landed on the table\u2019s edge, I landed hard on the concrete floor with a 200 pound police officer above me. Both hands clamped firmly on my windpipe.\n\nI could not breath. I could not speak. All I could do was stare upwards and mouth to the spirits, help\u2026me\u2026\n\nBlack edges began to fade in from the corners of my eyes but on the edge of the table I saw the black hammer begin to move. \n\nI had never witnessed any spirit move objects before. I thought it was another myth. But perhaps because of the circumstance or perhaps because of the amount of them, the hammer moved. Only slightly at first. Only subtly but it grew in power until it fell to the ground.\n\nIt was a meaty smack. I had managed in my desperation to land the hammer\u2019s blow directly at the officer\u2019s temple. He fell to the side, clutching his head and giving me enough opportunity to wrestle myself from underneath him.\n\nHis left eye was bloodshot and his right one stared at nothing. He seemed to try and speak to me, possibly begging. But as his hand went up to try and stop me I unleashed a flurry of swings downwards onto him.\n\nAgain.\n\nAnd again.\n\nI cried as I did so, but didn\u2019t dare stop until nothing was left but red. Red everywhere. Just like that day. Just like the visions.\n\nI didn\u2019t have time to pity myself, though. I heard my look out once again screaming at me through the voices and the furious barking.\n\n*THE LADY IS HERE! GET OUT!*\n\nThe windows were barred and I found no door to the outside world. As the steps indicated that Trittle was directly above me, I ducked underneath the stairs. She opened the door and immediately ran towards the body.\n\nI took my chance to bound up the stairs and lock the door behind me. I stole keys from the coffee table and rushed outside. I did not care that the car was a police vehicle, in fact I welcomed it.\n\nI pulled away onto the road with siren blaring and lights flashing. I spoke frantically over the radio, begging for help. Eventually a swarm of police vehicles, sheriffs, and highway patrol stopped me while I sped down the highway.\n\nThey arrested Trittle. She won\u2019t get the death penalty, it was abolished in Colorado in 2020. She will likely spend the rest of her life in prison. Although she\u2019s trying to claim I murdered Haines in cold blood, the evidence is pretty stacked towards self defense. Especially, since they\u2019ve started uncovering the bodies.\n\nI went back to the house yesterday. From the outside, it looked completely normal and it was even in the same neighborhood as mine. It was quaint. It was quiet. Soft breezes swayed the branches of the evergreens in the yard.\n\n**Peaceful now, isn\u2019t it? They\u2019ve all moved on.**\n\n\u201cI never got your name,\u201d I said to the ghost of the man who saved my life.\n\n**James Chisholm,** he said. **But thanks to you now everyone will know what happened to me. My wife and my little girl will know. That\u2019s all I wanted. Thank you.**\n\nThe wind picked up and the branches swayed more. For a moment the sun broke through the clouds and let down a ray of light.\n\n*And thank you from me too,* said a familiar voice.\n\nI smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not good at goodbyes.\u201d\n\n*You don\u2019t have to be.* \n\nThough I could not see her, I know that we spent a few minutes just admiring the nature. The same nature that had made us both avid hikers. That had, through unconventional means, brought us together.\n\n*Can I ask you a question?*\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said.\n\n*Where will I go? Now that I\u2019m leaving for good.*\n\n\u201cTo be honest, Alice, I don\u2019t know. No one\u2019s ever come back from the other side to tell me.\u201d\n\n*Well\u2026 wherever it is, I hope you get to go to the best version of it. After you\u2019re done down here of course.*\n\nI smiled again. She passed on just as the raindrops started to fall. I continued my drive out of the neighborhood and out of that little Colorado town. And after I passed the sign that said I was leaving, I looked into the sky and saw a rainbow.",

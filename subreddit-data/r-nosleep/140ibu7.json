    "postText": "So this is an update on how I accidentally killed a ghost. If you want to know how I accidentally killed a ghost, you can find the story here: \\[https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13zet02/help\\_i\\_accidently\\_killed\\_a\\_ghost\\_and\\_i\\_dont\\_know/\\].\r  \n\r  \nAround 30 minutes after I made the original post, my coworker, Sunny, came down the basement stairs. Her mouth was agape as she saw the lifeless body of the ghost woman lying near the foot of the stairs. Her head had stopped bleeding the inky liquid, but her eyes were now a milky white color.\r  \n\r  \nShe stared at the horrific display before looking back up at me. I thought she would have been freaking out, seeing a dead woman on the floor, but her expression was more of dismay. She pinched the bridge of her nose and let out a sigh. \"What happened?\"\r  \n\r  \nThe coherent thoughts in my head that would have clarified everything came out as a jumbled mess from my mouth. \"I-I was watching the tapes and sorting, and there were only two tapes left, so...\" My rambly explanation was cut short by her accusatory shout, \"So you watched the tape with the red strip!\"\r  \n\r  \nThe conviction in her voice made my heart sink. I retorted as quickly as she had cut me off, \"No! I said there were only two tapes. Of course, I would choose the one that I had to watch and not the one I wasn't supposed to!\"\r  \n\r  \nSunny was taken aback by what I said. \"So you're telling me the tape without the red strip caused this?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Yes! For crying out loud, she climbed out of the TV!\" My voice cracked a bit after I finished my sentence.\r  \n\r  \nSunny breathed out a deep sigh and walked down the remaining steps, taking extra caution not to step into the black puddle of blood. She seemed to be investigating the scene, looking at the water that spilled out of the TV and ran down the TV cart.\r  \n\r  \n\"Where are her footprints?\" the question caught me off guard.\r  \n\r  \n\"It dried up,\" I answered.\r  \n\r  \n\"In under 5 minutes?\"\r  \n\r  \nI stared at her, baffled. \"What do you mean? I've been waiting for you for like an hour and a half.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"What? But I ran all the way here. 5 minutes,\" the sincerity in her voice was undeniable.\r  \n\r  \nI pulled my phone out of my pocket and looked at the time displayed. \"See, it's 7:30. I called you at 6:30. Where were you at that time?\" I spoke while raising my phone up to her.\r  \n\r  \nSunny's eyes started to widen as she raised her arm, pulling back the sleeve to reveal a very fancy-looking wristwatch. \"The time is six past six,\" her voice quivered. I walked over to also look at her watch, and she was right. The time on her watch was six past six, six minutes past six o'clock. We both looked at each other in utter shock.\r  \n\r  \nBehind us, we heard the sound of a loud static eruption. Both of our heads turned in sync to look at the television set where we heard the loud bang. The sight was captivating. I don't know how to describe it accurately, but the screen of the TV was overflowing with blue static, like smoke pouring out and floating up to the ceiling.\r  \n\r  \nI found myself walking over to the television set and decided to see if I could stick my hand in. I have no idea why I thought of this idea, but I did. Astoundingly, my hand went through the TV. It felt cold and wet, with the sensation of bubbles clinging to my arm, as if I had stuck my hand into a large bucket of club soda. I pulled my hand out, drenched in the bluish water. I looked back at Sunny and saw that we were both thinking the same thing.\r  \n\r  \nNow, if you had told me that I would be dragging the body of a ghost woman across a basement to force through a TV that looked like a portal to a watery dimension, I would have laughed and slapped you across the face. But, with the help of Sunny, we successfully dragged the corpse all the way to the television. Now came the part of dumping her body into the TV portal. We managed to get her head into the TV and were busy trying to maneuver her shoulder in as well.\r  \n\r  \nWe took a break when half of her torso was in the TV portal, only showing her backside. Pushing a fully-grown woman into a box TV-sized portal proved really tiring. After the break, we went back to work. Only this time, the ghost woman's hand twitched. I yelped as I saw her index finger slightly curl, and Sunny let out a bunch of startled curses.\r  \n\r  \nOur screams grew as we saw the ghost start to reanimate. Her hand curled into fists, violently swinging as her legs kicked. Her ear-piercing wails came back full force, as if her skull being cracked on a bunch of stairs had merely paused it.\r  \n\r  \nNow, for the second and hopefully final time, I acted out of sheer panic. I ran up to the television, grabbed her legs, and shoved her deeper into the TV portal. She beat my chest with her kicks and made my ears ring with her blood-curdling screeches, but I refused to let up. I finally got her all the way through the TV as quickly as humanly possible. I yanked the cords linking the TV to the VHS player. Finally, her wails were cut short as the TV showed static.\r  \n\r  \nFor good measure, I also took the VHS out of the player and tossed it back into the box. I looked back at Sunny, who remained frozen, her hand covering her mouth as her eyes widened. For a long while, she imitated a statue. She finally spoke after a while, \"Hey, um...\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Yeah?\" I said, perking my ears.\r  \n\r  \n\"We're not gonna say anything, right?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"I wasn't planning on it.\"\r  \n\r  \nShe returned to her animated state, and we both walked out of the basement, climbing the stairs. \"Are we gonna clean up the blood?\" I asked from behind.\r  \n\r  \n\"I'll do it later tonight. But how did you kick a ghost?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"I don't know. I either have a superpower, or it was just a really shitty ghost.\"\r  \n\r  \nSunny chuckled at the remark as we left the basement, now entering the warehouse. She stopped before turning around and flashing the light almost in my eyes. \"Um... Are you gonna quit?\" the question was a bit out of the blue but considering what happened, probably not totally unexpected.\r  \n\r  \n\"Maybe. I mean, other than what just happened today, this job is pretty sweet,\" my response seemed to ease her as she gave a light smirk. I then asked her, \"You gonna quit?\" She immediately retorted, \"Oh god no. Where else would I go, retail?\" I laughed at her response to my question, and we walked back to the front of the store. The manager saw me appear and walked down to greet me.\r  \n\r  \n\"Hello, new employee. How was your shift as an archivist?\" The manager flashed his perfect row of teeth and smirked at me. \"It went well,\" I responded, a bit nervous.\r  \n\r  \n\"Good, good. Did you watch all the VHS tapes as required?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Yes, sir, but there was one with a red strip that I didn't watch.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Oh, yes, how fantastic. Now...\" the manager pulled something out of his pocket, still maintaining eye contact. \"Here is your bonus. Spend it on something good.\" He gave me a light slap on the shoulder before walking back to his office.\r  \n\r  \nI looked down at the $20 bill in my hand. All that for $20. I can at least buy a couple of tubs of ice cream with this money. I grabbed my things and left the store, saying goodbye to Sunny as I walked out.\r  \n\r  \nI am now typing this story in the comfort of my apartment, also with a half tub of ice cream on my lap. This might be my last post; I'm not really sure. I mean, some interesting things are bound to happen if I take the night shift, right?",

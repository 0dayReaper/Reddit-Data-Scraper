    "postText": "The bodies the authorities found in the middle of the park, laid out in the dead of night were torn to shreds. A killer- or beast unseen had struck them in a flurry, striking whilst everyone slept.\n\nTheir skins were pale, blood sucked away. They cloths were torn. Their limbs were snapped.\n\nOne by one, the members of the HOA fell. Their greed and power picked off, one by one, and yet they still carried an air of pretention, and superiority.\n\nMy name is Quentin Lorreno. I\u2019m somewhat of a middleman in the criminal underworld. I mediate the crime families, I arrange diplomatic marriages, I keep things civil.\n\nBut above all I host auctions. Art is a tastefully wonderful medium of laundering money, and hosting both underworld- and legal auctions is kind of my speciality.\n\nAnd I also recover and sell cursed artifacts.\n\nToday was a day off. On days off I usually plugged in one of our many gaming consoles onto one of the large screen televisions to play some games. But not today, no, today I was busy signing off an import of a large crate of Sanheim Root- a rare herb grown only in Stetski (Serpenthead) Temples that causes one to hallucinate several possible futures.\n\nThis was when Steven, great assistant as he was, approached me. \u201cQuentin,\u201d he greeted, helping me carry the crate, \u201cI\u2019ve got a request to make.\u201d\n\nThe words struck me as odd. Of my little team, Steven was the quietest of the bunch, and on off-days he spent his time with his family, away from the city and safe in suburbia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an off-day, Steven,\u201d I pointed out, \u201cyou can do anything. Shouldn\u2019t you be with your family?\u201d\n\nHe nodded at that. \u201cAye, sir, but I need your help with something.\u201d He sounded somber, and Steven was never one for emotion. \u201cI\u2019m fighting the HOA in my neighborhood- I could really use some help- I\u2019m a bit too old to really connect with the kids.\u201d\n\nThis was true. Steven was quite old, and he\u2019d worked for my father for over a decade before my father died and the family business of the artifact black market fell to me.\n\nI owed him a favor. Probably many. \u201cSure, what\u2019re you fighting on?\u201d\n\nHe sighed solemnly as he put the crate down. \u201cThe homeowner\u2019s association want to build a new swimming pool and gym to replace Oldman Park. That park,\u201d there were distant memories in his eyes, \u201cis one of the last few green spaces we have left- it means alot for me, and I don\u2019t want to live to see it destroyed.\u201d\n\nThis greatly puzzled me. I hadn\u2019t ever envisioned Steven as an environmentalist. No, he always seemed neutral on politics whenever they\u2019d come up.\n\nHe always said he was \u2018too old to be making decisions for the young\u2019, and that was one of the things I truly respected about him.\n\nSteven\u2019s cause sounded good enough. \u201cI\u2019ll help you. Should I call Aster and Matt?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Steven declined, \u201cthis is something I want to keep between us.\u201d\n\nI finished logging the crate onto our database, and then we were off. Steven owned a small van which he drove to work every day- although I had always offered to convert one of the larger storehouses into a living space.\n\nWe passed through the city fairly quickly. It was a weekend, and generally the city was never too crowded.\n\nA quarter of an hour later and we were in rolling hills with the occasional group of markets, all identical. That was something that had always tickled me somewhat- outposts of stores all identical, anywhere in the world- cookie cutter style.\n\nAnywhere you went- there was a McDonald\u2019s.\n\nThe stores soon passed into a neighborhood, and very soon we passed Oldman Park, construction already surrounding the place. \u201cThey,\u201d Steven informed, \u201cstill have to vote on it before starting.\u201d\n\nThe vote was today. And Steven really needed help turning the crowd. He told me that they were stuck on an even split, and hoped a young voice such as mine would help raise some of the other \u2018youngsters\u2019 to his cause.\n\nSteven parked the van in front of a medium sized building, just as cookie cutter as the stores we\u2019d seen earlier. This was town hall.\n\n\u201cSo how exactly can I help?\u201d I inquired, not entirely sure. \u201cShould I say something? Pretend I\u2019m an activist?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d like,\u201d Steven suggested, shrugging. \u201cI think having you by me will simply raise my confidence.\u201d\n\nI opted to mention whatever passerbys emerged to save Oldman Park. This went well until we entered the main meeting room, a large, sterile-white place with four members of the HOA sitting quite proudly.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the ones against me,\u201d Steven informed.\n\nWe sat across from them, and I observed the group. They laid back on their phones, knitting, ignorant of our entrance. They seemed awfully, as Steven would say, \u2018too old to be making decisions for the young\u2019.\n\n\u201cSteven,\u201d an old woman with obnoxious blonde-dyed, frizzled hair hissed. \u201cThe renovations to Oldman Park will benefit us all.\u201d\n\nAnd old man who held a rosary crowed in, \u201cThink of our house prices. They\u2019ll go through the roof!\u201d\n\nThe third one, a woman with a loudly barking chihuahua spat, \u201cIt\u2019ll make our neighborhood so much nicer- who really goes that park?\u201d\n\nSteven attempted to mention the families that did, but was silenced by the fourth member of the gang. \u201cA gym, pool, and a spa instead of a good-for-nothing park will open up so many more jobs, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d I cut in, adamant to help my friend, \u201cyou do realize this isn\u2019t for everyone, right? You know, studies suggest its important to have at least one green space-\u201d\n\n\u201cBah!\u201d blonde-dyed woman (whom I\u2019ll name Karen) snapped. \u201cWho cares for those radical lies. First thing its protecting the green space and the next thing its our children.\u201d\n\nThis elicited a look of puzzlement on both our faces. \u201cWho said anything about children?\u201d Steven pointed out. Karen's face turned red.\n\nA flock of college aged kids entered next, and they shook Steven\u2019s hands, greeting him. These were the ones on his side, but even as they entered, a of the oddly older, more hostile community poured in.\n\n\u201cSorry, Steve,\u201d a cap wearing man apologized, shirt filled with pins. \u201cMy friends at the university think voting won\u2019t change anything- they only want to after bigger companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Jason,\u201d Steven assured. \u201cWe can win this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe in you guys!\u201d I added. That didn\u2019t help at all. I couldn\u2019t vote anyway. I was starting to wonder what I should do.\n\nVoting began promptly as head of the HOA, the Chihuahua toting lady announced her plans to bulldoze the park and transform it into an elegant, public spa, gym, and pool.\n\nSteven argued against her next, telling the history of the place. The founders of the place, long before it had sprouted into a suburb were settlers who kept the park sacred, a place of meditation and study.\n\nThe rosary clutching man commented that they would build a church, so that all could meditate and study.\n\nJason claimed it just wouldn\u2019t feel the same. On and on they argued while I sat, a bit lost on what to do, silently supporting Steven and, as Karen mockingly called them, the \u2018greenies\u2019.\n\n\u201cAlright, cool it!\u201d Chihuahua lady snapped, slamming her purse on the table. \u201cLet\u2019s vote. All in favor- say aye!\u201d\n\nThe noise that followed was louder that the \u2018aiaiais\u2019 of her dog. That many was in favor of destroying the part. So many, in fact, that the voters against could barely fight back.\n\n\u201cThen it\u2019s decided,\u201d Karen monotone, a smile on her face. \u201cWith a vote of 32 to 30 construction begins tomorrow. We\u2019re so blessed, house prices are going to SOAR!\u201d\n\nSteven frowned and walked out the room. I, and many others followed.\n\nWe walked together back to the van in silence. We just kind of sat there for a while, before Steven turned the key and started the van. I asked where we were heading next, and he told me it was the park.\n\nParking in front of the construction work he turned to me and put a hand on my shoulder. \u201cHey, it didn\u2019t go well but I want you to know I\u2019m really glad you came.\u201d He paused and unbuckled his seat belt. \u201cYour father never really helped me fight off the HOA- I\u2019ve been doing it for the past decade. I guess it\u2019s over now.\u201d\n\nNo, there was something more here, more than a simple park. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\nHe walked out and I followed, wandering to the center of the small, yet open field. A great stone sat in the center, frozen in time. The sun began to set, and the small streams around it glittered in the evening sun.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the park, really,\u201d he continued, sitting in front of the stone. He touched it, and it seemed to glow. \u201cThis is where I learned my magic.\u201d\n\nSteven had served my father many years as his magician. He enchanted artifacts, drew protection sigils, and helped with virtually anything he needed. And he\u2019d shown double the amount of work to protect me.\n\n\u201cThis?\u201d I touched the rock. I didn\u2019t feel the sense of power that Steven clearly did.\n\nHe whispered something in a language I could not fathom to the rock. That was when I saw them.\n\nThere were small people living on the rock- no, now it wasn\u2019t a rock, but a bustling city lit by fae-lights and attended to by hundreds- no, thousands of people.\n\n\u201cFairies,\u201d I gasped, shocked. \u201cI thought they\u2019d all gone extinct?\u201d They were joyous in the way they carried themselves, ignoring the two of us. The fluttered here and there, bringing small crops to markets, strutting around happily, mindlessly whistling a tune.\n\nIt was gorgeous, and now I understood why Steven was so adamant on saving the park. \u201cIndeed,\u201d he confirmed, \u201cthis is one of the last fairies to live.\u201d\n\nI remembered the history lessons my father had Steven teach me. Lessons of the darker, more magical world. Tales of industrialization and the horrors it brought about the little folk.\n\nTiny bodies, invisible to all but the trusted, blackened by smog. Cities disguised as boulders and trees, crushed by the force of factories, construction.\n\nOnce upon a time these beings had power. This time was long over- the dawn of steel and iron slew them by the thousands- for they were immunne to all but the most refined of metals.\n\nAnd so we killed them. A silent, slow death. Genocide upon a million silent voices.\n\n\u201cI spent my childhood in this park,\u201d Steven started, tears welling up in his eyes. \u201cI saw them when I was six. And I brought them food at first, curious. It was hard to gain their trust- but eventually, I did.\u201d In the distance, I could hear the shouts of a chihuahua. \u201cI grew with the city, and their Queen- now dead taught me magic.\u201d\n\nSteven drew something in the air, a message of pure energy that drifted into the heart of the city. \u201cYour father never liked getting involved with fairy-folk. But they gave me my everything, and I can\u2019t let them die.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t they move?\u201d I suggested.\n\n\u201cThey have nowhere else to go,\u201d Steven revealed, sighing. \u201cOn all four sides are they surrounded with homes, cars, people- they would be destroyed. And the last truly green places on earth are threatened every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cFairies were once powerful-\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will fight,\u201d Steven finished. \u201cThey won\u2019t leave but they will fight- and I have done all that I can. They\u2019ve sent their familiars to attack those who would harm them. But nothing has changed.\u201d He paused, eyeing two approaching figures, Karen and the woman with the dog. \u201cWhat happens here will likely be their last stand.\u201d\n\nAnd the two HOA members approached, staring at us with eyes as evil and the stones of Kubash-Enneth. They shook their fists against us, as demons in the evening sun.\n\n\u201cAre you talking to a rock, Steven?\u201d Karen hissed.\n\n\u201cDo you live here, old man?\u201d the dog wielding woman snapped. \u201cAt Oldman Park?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone senile, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d Karen mocked. \u201cAnd,\u201d she sized me up, \u201cwhoever the hell you are.\u201d\n\nThis is when the wind started.\n\nFrom a calm nothing came a whistling, and the skies began to clear, letting the full force of the sun beat down upon us. And then the wind began to swirl, and me and Steven stepped back, behind the stone city.\n\n\u201cScared? You should be happy we\u2019re improving-\u201d and then the wind screamed. It screamed as stray leaves and dust picked up and I swear it was creating a face.\n\nThere was a face as real as the grass and sky in the wind, swirling. The cruel two snapped and snarled at us, ignorant of the mysticism. The dog\u2019s barks increased in tempo and sound, warning of the disaster that was to come.\n\nThe figure in the wind manifested then, a swirling, humanoid mass of leaves. And then the two HOA members screamed.\n\nIt reached out a leafy, cutting appendage and covered Karen with its leaves, slicing and sucking her into the mess. What remained as it passed through her was a dead body, skin paler in color and blood pouring out of her body- being vacuumed into the storm.\n\nMe and Steven only watched as the creature, enchanted through fairy magic chased the woman, absorbing her into its body and only leaving behind limbs, skin, and bones.\n\nThe dog barked and fled the scene. The creature did not make chase.\n\nIt faced us then, considered our efforts, and vanished into the wind, leaves and blades of grass settling gently.\n\n\u201cShould we hide the bodies?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cLeave them here,\u201d Steven decided. \u201cPerhaps they will treat this as a sign.\u201d I shook my head; it was unlikely.\n\n\u201cThe vote was 32 to 30,\u201d I reminded. \u201cWith these two\u2026 gone, it\u2019s a tie. Call an emergency redo or something- the bodies should delay construction for what? A week or so?\u201d\n\nA moment's pause came then. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Steven concluded. \u201cWe can still make this work.\u201d\n\nI had an idea then. \u201cI can get Aster- her gift may come in handy.\u201d Steven understood my plan then- Aster\u2019s gift allowed her to reach into the minds of the weak (I assumed all HOA members were just as weak and frail as they looked on the outside).\n\nIf we were lucky, she, perhaps, could uncover memories of the park, nostalgia- or perhaps, dark secrets we could use as blackmail material.\n\nAs we drove back to the Auction House Steven mused over the fairies\u2019 war. Their constructs of nature and flesh were powerful things, but beyond the park their power was limited by bits of metal and iron within the neighborhood.\n\nAt best, perhaps a spirit-fox or a lower tier golem. At worst, maybe a light that induced light paranoia.\n\nThings were not looking good for the fairies.\n\nI floated the idea of relocating them to the Auction House, but it simply wasn\u2019t green enough. No connection with nature, no direct bond to freedom. No, they would have to stay, and we would have to fight.\n\nI wondered why I was helping Steven and the fairies.\n\nIt didn\u2019t affect me in any way whether they die or survive. Besides my good conscience, perhaps. But something deep within me told me this was the right thing to do, to save the endlings of an already dead race.\n\nThat was it.\n\nI posted a surprise closure on my website for the next day. I lied about a leak in the water, intending to gather my team to stop the HOA.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d I began, having gathered all four of us in my office, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering why we\u2019re closed today.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother day off?\u201d Matt guessed, optimistic.\n\nSteven spoke next, telling his tale about our journey to the park and the vote we saw. He told his childhood, of how he gained their trust and was taught the ancient, arcane arts from the very source of all things magical.\n\nHe pleaded for us to save the fae. And to Aster and Matt\u2019s credit, they listened- and agreed.\n\n\u201cYou want me to rough them up?\u201d Matt suggested, flexing his muscles. \u201cI may have no magic or nothing, but I\u2019ve hunted monsters since the day I turned sixteen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing like that,\u201d I declined. \u201cI guess you can come for intimidation support.\u201d I told Aster the plan to uncover distant nostalgia and dark secrets to convince them to vote for the park.\n\n\u201cI can do that,\u201d she affirmed. \u201cAnything to help a friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call an emergency meeting,\u201d Steven decided, now realizing there was a chance. \u201cI can say that the deaths of Barbara and Karen-\u201d so her name really was Karen? \u201cPuts the community out of balance!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen let\u2019s do this!\u201d I cheered, already stepping out the door.\n\nWe took Steven\u2019s van. Also, he was the only one who drove to work- I lived inside the building sometimes, and Aster and Matt both had apartments.\n\nCity turned to cookie cutter stores, and those stores turned to the suburbs, and before we knew it, we were there.\n\nSteven\u2019s post had drawn enough members in to redo the vote, and we\u2019d arrived a whole hour earlier to convince the people. I and Aster would head one direction and go door to door, while Steven and Matt would do the same.\n\nArmed with magic, flyers, our wisened words, and a psychic, we were ready for anything. Especially an evil HOA bent on increasing the value of their homes.\n\nHope, nostalgia, and the dying power of the fae were on our side. Maybe not so much that last part.\n\nMe and Aster made quick work of the first row of houses, elderly couples who invited us in for tea. Most supported us, but were far too unconcerned to vote. I spun terrifying stories of a generation unable to see the green and Aster reached within to evoke waves of nostalgia.\n\nWe had mixed results.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you wish your kids could see that park too, and play?\u201d I insisted.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have kids,\u201d an old, tie wearing man informed.\n\n\u201cOkay, but what about other people\u2019s kids?\u201d I repeated. Aster reached in to evoke nostalgia.\n\n\u201cI hate children,\u201d the man insisted.\n\nSix times out of ten we were successful. And to me, that was a good sign, especially as the hour drew to a close.\n\nThe house of the rosary pressing man was last on our journey, and as we stepped on his porch we wondered if our mission would ring true.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d I began, as the man opened the door, \u201cI\u2019m wondering if you\u2019d like to change your thoughts on the park?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he silenced. \u201cConstruction is going to make this place rich.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d Aster spoke, reaching in as she did, \u201cby the time housing prices soar, you\u2019ll likely be dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut my children can reap the benefits!\u201d he insisted, wagging a finger at our faces.\n\nAster grimaced as she found a particularly distasteful memory. \u201cYou-\u201d something glimmered in her eyes, \u201cdon\u2019t talk to your children often. They don\u2019t believe in the same causes you do. What makes you think they\u2019ll appreciate this.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I said so, that\u2019s why-\u201d he paused, stunned. \u201cHow the hell do you know-\u201d\n\nAster cut him off. \u201cDoing this for your children won\u2019t make them hate you any more- but perhaps talking to them, and saving the park will help your kids more.\u201d\n\n\u201cI-\u201d he stopped, and slammed the door behind him.\n\n\u201cWell, that went well,\u201d I decided. My watch rang. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nThe team regrouped and together, with a new, rising army of the young, the middle, and old behind us. We were ready to vote. We had spread the word- only by participating within the small scale world could one truly make a difference.\n\nLife, I assumed, was like that. A thousand small things that added up into something truly real.\n\nEach small member, each person added into the culmination of the vote we would have today.\n\nIn the trees and shadows, brilliant foxes and lights watched us closely. Their survival bordered on our words. And I didn\u2019t want to see any other person, greedy HOA member or not, get killed by the whimsical spirits of nature.\n\n\u201cAs Karen nor Barbara are here,\u201d Rosary-Man began, \u201cI am in charge. Today we\u2019re gathered in the name of lord- er, construction to determine the fate of Oldman Park.\u201d He paused and scanned the audience. \u201cI know we\u2019re divided over this topic. Some of us want the new spa and gym. Some of us want to preserve the park. So let us discuss.\u201d\n\nSteven spoke next. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here all my life, and this park has brought me countless memories. Days skipping across with butterflies. Drawing things in the dirt, basking against the sun- surely you would not deprive your children-\u201d he eyed Rosary-Man; we\u2019d informed him of Aster\u2019s discovery, \u201cof these fine memories.\u201d\n\nThe crowd rumbled in both agreement and disagreement. Aster reached beyond the veil, tugging at the very heart of the community.\n\n\u201cThen let us vote!\u201d struck the man with the rosary. \"And personally- I have decided to keep the park.\"\n\nAnd so we voted. To vote for the both the soul of the community and for the survival of a species. For Steven\u2019s memories. For my conscience. A step forward in a brighter path.\n\n\u201cThe vote concludes,\u201d Steven shouted, taking all the ballots. He and Rosary-Man counted. \u201c64-38 in favor of preservation!\u201d A wide, joyous smile crept up on his face.\n\nWe had succeeded. Our will had preserved.\n\nI found myself with Steven hours later, walking the trail of the park, slowly making our way to the center. Aster and Matt had returned; there were still more boxes to catalog at the House.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Steven said, as we approached the stone, bristled with more life than ever. Spirit-Creatures danced around us, only seen to our eyes and the moon. \u201cYour father was deep in the world of the artifact. But you\u2019ve shown me that there\u2019s a new side to the trade, a less criminal, good side.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Steven,\u201d I echoed. \u201cYou\u2019ve served both my father and me. Thank you for being with us.\u201d\n\nHe laughed heartily and looked within my eyes with an old, wisened stare. \u201cMy debts to your family are long from being fully paid. But I\u2019m happy to serve for many years to come.\u201d\n\nAnd we watched the small folk upon their city, blissfully ignorant of the outside world, safe in their last citadel of safety. Even as their species came to an end did they find the smallest moments to live, to dance, to truly enjoy.\n\nAnd yet as small and insignificant as they were, their survival touched my heart, and it was then when I truly realized how significant even the smallest things could be.\n\nAnd though I was scared of the beasts the fairies had summoned, the thought of victory was good enough to assuade me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Issue #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13cci6c/i_sell_cursed_artifacts_for_a_living_theres_a/)\n\n[Issue #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13de659/i_sell_cursed_artifacts_for_a_living_this_is_the/)\n\n[Issue #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13eb7ri/i_sell_cursed_artifacts_for_a_living_i_found_out/)\n\n[Issue #4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13f8u81/i_sell_cursed_artifacts_for_a_living_dont_let/)\n\n[Issue #5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13g5lnp/i_sell_cursed_artifacts_for_a_living_in_an_old/)\n\n[House of Lorreno](https://www.reddit.com/r/JulianPageInstitute?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

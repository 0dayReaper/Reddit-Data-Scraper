    "postText": "The building had a reputation for being haunted. Kids would dare each other to go inside, but unlike other places around town, they would actually see something- or at least claim that they did.\n\n\nLittle Jamie Curry, 9-years-old, went into the basement of the abandoned Leatherman\u2019s complex on a dare and saw a zombie. He said he knew it wasn\u2019t just some guy in an outfit because the zombie had a grapefruit-sized hole in its chest, and he could actually see right through the middle of the thing. He had run right past his group of friends who were patiently waiting outside, screaming and wetting himself as he went. \n\n\nAnother young kid from my town, Alicia DeSilva, 11-years-old, said it was all a bunch of garbage, that she wasn\u2019t afraid of a run-down factory building, except for maybe the asbestos which her uncle told her \u201crots your lungs from the inside\u201d. She had said she would even go inside it at night. Why not? After all, there were no such things as ghosts or boogeymen. \n\n\nOne of her friends told Alicia that if she went inside Leatherman\u2019s main building at night, grabbed something from the basement and brought it back out for their mutual inspection, the friend would pay Alicia *five* dollars. Alicia had gasped. Five bucks was a good amount to someone like her. With five dollars, she could even get a kit so that she could finally fix her bike tire. They all met in front of the building, and Alicia disappeared into the dark fire doors on the side of the building, full of bravado and still laughing as she went inside.\n\n\nExcept unlike Jamie Curry, Alicia never came back out screaming and wetting herself, never had a chance to tell some unbelievable story about what she encountered in the fetid basement of that place. Her body was never found. The police were called after a few hours, and they searched the entire building from top to bottom. They were able to follow some fresh footprints in the dust that might have been Alicia\u2019s, but when they got to the basement, the prints just disappeared- as if the person making them had simply gotten sucked up into the ceiling. And yet they did find one thing, the only real evidence left in the entire building that night. What they found still gives me nightmares sometimes.\n\n\nOne of her eyeballs was inside a snowglobe. The glass and foundation of the snowglobe were all intact, and there were no signs of foul play anywhere on the decoration. It was as if it had been manufactured that way- with that blue, staring eye floating lazily next to plastic mountains and white glitter snowflakes.\n\n\nIn my nightmares, I often see an old woman shaking that snowglobe, an old hag who cackles and whose split lips form into a dreadful smile as she stares directly at me. The eye and the glitter all hang suspended in the water for a moment, then begin to fall slowly, the eye spinning rapidly as it drifts down the front of the globe. And when it\u2019s stopped, I see it is looking directly at me, and it still looks frightened.\n\n\n\\***\n\n\nOK, so that last paragraph was pretty dark. But what I\u2019m trying to communicate is just how terrifying that place is. The kids in school know what\u2019s going on, though, at least in a general way. After all, Alicia and Jamie came from among them, and they\u2019re not the only ones. Others have gone into the building before. And Matt wants me to go with him tomorrow to look at it.\n\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why the dreams are getting worse. Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019ve woken up screaming twice in the last few hours. Because there was something else, too, something else I saw in my nightmares. In that building, around the back walls, there were dozens of kids. Their skin was chalk-white, their hair and eyes all pure black. They were dead. And then thousands of \u201cMissing\u201d posters started to fly down, all of them of smiling children. I looked between the ones surrounding me and the posters and noticed that some of them showed these same kids. I turned to run but little rotted hands started pulling me down and then, I was sitting straight up in bed, yelling and pleading.\n\n\nI really don\u2019t want to go in that building tomorrow.\n\n\n\\***\n\n\nOK, so Matt and I went inside the doorway. No way was I going in the basement. But just the front doorway\u2026 well, that wasn\u2019t too bad. I even stuck my head in and looked around inside.\n\n\nMatt didn\u2019t see it, but I did. There was something huge in the front hall. It wasn\u2019t much more than a silhouette. It looked like a very tall, very thin man in a suit whose neck was all twisted and strange. It came off his chest like a snake\u2019s, turning and curling back on itself, and at the end it had this reptilian face. Everything about the man was hairless and slimy. I could smell the strange stuff on his skin.\n\n\nBut by the time I had gotten Matt\u2019s attention and pointed it out to him, the guy was gone. I don\u2019t know how he disappeared so fast. \n\n\nMatt was making fun of me as we walked home afterwards, pointing at random alleyways and asking, \u201cDo you see him there, too?\u201d and then laughing. It wasn\u2019t that funny. I\u2019ll prove to him there was someone in there.\n\n\n\\***\n\n\nI convinced Matt to come back with me. I need to see what\u2019s in there. He wasn\u2019t thrilled about it, but I told him an older kid offered to pay $10 for a souvenir from the place, and that I\u2019d split it with him if he went with me. All of this was total crap, of course. But I want to see what was in there, and I definitely want these dreams to stop.\n\n\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019re lucky you have a friend as brave and manly as me,\u201d Matt said, puffing up his little bird-chest. \u201cAfter what happened to those other schmucks, everyone has been avoiding this place like the plague.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, but unlike all of them, you know it\u2019s just a building,\u201d I said. He gave me a funny look then.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a building, but you know something actually happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI was talking to my dad about it, and he said maybe a homeless guy was living there, totally deranged, and maybe he cut out Alicia\u2019s eye and kidnapped her.\u201d He stated this was the seriousness of a news anchor recounting bits of total bullshit for the audience. I smiled at his grave expression, repressing an urge to laugh. He looked over at me disapprovingly. \u201cIt could have happened, you know. Homeless people are homeless because they\u2019re crazy. My dad says so. Maybe one of them just went really crazy and started taking souvenirs off of people\u2019s bodies.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI guess,\u201d I said. We were most of the way through the old industrial part of town now. Shuttered factories and condemned buildings stretched out on both sides of the street. A fat, limping raccoon walked lazily out of a nearby alleyway. He gave us a sideways glance, stopping for a moment, then kept on maneuvering his round frame forward. Something that Matt had said had given me pause.\n\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d I said, \u201cit\u2019s kinda weird that we don\u2019t have homeless people out here. We have all these empty buildings, yet most of them camp out on the sidewalks on Main Street. I\u2019ve never seen a single homeless person sleeping in one of these buildings, and I\u2019ve never seen one even close to the Leatherman building. It\u2019s like they have some sort of sixth sense to avoid the place.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cClearly they\u2019re smarter than you and me,\u201d Matt muttered. We were walking past the rusty metal chain link fence around the property. He looked pale and his eyes were wide. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d Right then, my instincts screamed at me to run.\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said simply, walking in first, taking the flashlight out of my pocket. \u201cI need to know. For sure. Either way, I\u2019d like evidence. Either it is my imagination, or something supernatural actually exists within and around this building.\u201d An old, musty smell permeated the huge hallway. I looked up and down it, wondering what was missing. Then I realized- it had no graffiti. It had to be the only abandoned building I\u2019d ever been in without tons of graffiti scrawled on the inside.\n\n\nIn some places, the walls had begun to buckle, and whole sections were crumbling and coming down. Farther ahead, the ceiling had collapsed inwards, blocking half of the main hallway off. Downstairs, lights started turning on, and the entire building started to come to life. I looked at Matt, who was looking dazed.\n\n\n\u201cBro, what the hell is that?\u201d he asked. I had no idea.\n\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s in here with us,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s go check it out.\u201d He looked at me like I was insane.\n\n\n\u201cAre you mad? What if it\u2019s cops? What if it\u2019s tweakers pulling out all the metal?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be quiet, and just peek around the corner,\u201d I said. \u201cI think we\u2019re meant to see this. Don\u2019t you want to know what\u2019s going on here?\u201d He scowled.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d much rather get home alive,\u201d he said, but he followed me reluctantly. There was a rhythmic hum coming from the floors now, as if machinery were coming to life. A sign, dirty and covered in spiderwebs, pointed to a staircase on the right. I looked down it, seeing bright light flood into the stairwell corridor, despite the fact that there was no electricity running to this building. We started down the staircase to the basement level. There was a smell of ozone in the air, a cyclical rhythmic humming that popped and buzzed. I took a deep breath, wondering what I would see down here. Then I poked my head around the corner.\n\n\nThere were conveyor belts stretching against the basement, their legs embedded into the cracked concrete floors. Beams and pillars ran up from the floor to the ceiling every ten feet or so. And it looked like there were countless workers just sitting on each side of the conveyor belts, sitting in crooked wooden chairs with splintering legs and backs. But it was the workers who caught my attention most of all. They looked\u2026 strange.\n\n\n\u201cDoes something look off to you?\u201d I whispered to Matt, who had been standing behind me only a moment earlier. But I got no reply. I figured he was too engrossed in the bizarre nature of what we were seeing to respond.\n\n\nThe workers, if that\u2019s what they were, looked blurred, as if in an overexposed picture with a long shutter speed. Their skin appeared to writhe and crackle, some of their heads constantly turned from side to side, and their limbs\u2026 all of them appeared to be missing limbs. I saw pale, white bodies without arms, without legs, even without heads, but they all still continued working in unison, moving in that jerky, blurred way.\n\n\n\u201cJesus, Matt, do you see?\u201d I asked suddenly, my eyes widening. \u201cDo you see what they\u2019re *doing*?\u201d I looked forward in horror as I saw human bodies rolled down the conveyor belts. The people were still alive. They were naked, many of them crying and covered in blood. As they passed by the workers, the blurred hands quickly took pieces of their skin off. Glistening sheets of it were raised by other workers walking along between the lines, and they would give an admiring look at the large pieces of skin, smiling eerily as their heads writhed from side to side and blurred in my vision.\n\n\nAnd I saw the kids from my dream, the kids from the missing persons posters, all in the corner. They were huddled, emaciated, with wide, staring eyes. They trembled and cowered as some of the workers came over to grab them and throw them on the belts.\n\n\nI turned to get the hell out of there, and that was when I realized Matt was no longer behind me. I caught a glimpse of something dark and massive moving at the top of the stairs, disappearing around the corner. I was alone. I know I should have stayed and looked for Matt, but instead, I ran. I got out of that place and went home and hid under my blankets.\n\n\nI thought 13 was old enough to deal with this, but it has gone way beyond what I thought.\n\n\n\\***\n\n\nMatt\u2019s parents are calling. My parents stand at the bottom of the stairs, my mother holding the landline in her thin hand, my father looking disturbed. They tell me that Matt is missing, that he never came home last night. What should I tell them? Certainly not the truth. If I started talking about the things in that building, I would be forced into a psychiatric ward before the week was up.\n\n\nThe police stopped by and asked me a few questions. I told them all straight-up lies. \u201cNo sir, I haven\u2019t seen him, and I have no idea what happened to him.\u201d But what else could I say? That he was taken by something from a nightmare?\n\n\nI have to go back. I have to try to rescue Matt. I shouldn\u2019t have ran like I did, but seeing those things cutting up people like that\u2026 it scared the shit out of me. Tonight, once my parents go to sleep, I\u2019m going to sneak out, and everyone will think I\u2019m a hero if I bring him back. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll probably end up as just another stupid missing kid who ended up way over his head.\n\n\n\\***\n\n\nI went back. I made it out, but I think they\u2019re coming for me. There was something in the basement.\n\n\nAll of the conveyor belts were gone, the lights were off, the rhythmic hum had disappeared. It was as if the other night was all a hallucination- except for, of course, Matt is still missing. His parents are freaking out, and I can\u2019t even tell them I know what happened to him, kinda.\n\n\nGoing into the building alone was terrifying. My legs felt like wood, and I kept glancing behind me every second as if I were hearing imaginary pursuers. But I walked through to the staircase, and I saw nothing.\n\n\nI went down to the basement, peeking my head around the corner. It was just a mostly empty basement, some broken furniture and old boxes stacked in one corner. I shone my light all over and saw no one. But there was a light coming from the far corner, a faint, glowing, orange light. A feeling of dread came over me.\n\n\nI crept slowly forward, trying to find the source of that light. A faint smell of smoke and roasting meat seemed to creep through the air. Off past the last line of boxes, I saw what looked like a small crater on the floor. There was a hole there with glowing fire underneath. Cracks spiderwebbed out from it in all directions for a few feet. More curious than afraid now, I peered forward and looked down.\n\n\nBeneath the abandoned building, there was another world. It had fire licking the walls and ground, and in the middle of this inferno, I saw Matt. His face was a map of blackish-purple bruises, his head was cocked at an unnatural angle, and I saw blood pouring out of his ears and nose. He looked up at me, and the bones in his neck grated together. I saw his spine was broken and his entire throat was crushed inwards.\n\n\n\u201cHelp me,\u201d he croaked. \u201cYou brought me here, now *help me*. You can\u2019t leave me. They\u2019ll come for you next\u2026\u201d All around him, I saw hands reaching up- the pale, jerky hands of those strange workers. They grabbed Matt and dragged him back down to the fire. I saw other horrid creatures in the flames, some laughing and insane, others shrieking in agony. Large, black insectile silhouettes moved through the smoke and flames. And then, like one, they started coming up towards the hole, coming up to the building where they would be free.\n\n\nI ran then, and I never went back. I know now that Matt is dead. I can\u2019t sleep. Every time I look out the window, I see shapes in the front yard- blurred humanoids with missing limbs, hiding in the bushes and trees, and constantly inching closer.",

    "postText": "In 2017, my roommate was busted for drug paraphernalia.  To make matters worse, the bust happened on the landlord\u2019s property, so even though no charges were placed on me, I was evicted.  Money was already tight, so without my roommate\u2019s contribution to rent I would\u2019ve had to move out anyway, but now I only had 3 days to find a place to stay.\n\nLiving in a rural area, my options were limited.  There was only one other small apartment complex and their rates were twice as high.  However, I did find a newly listed rental only five miles away.  It looked like an old barn that had been renovated and turned into a vertical duplex.  The listing said both floors were vacant, but only showed pictures of the bottom floor.  It was shabby, but I had no room to complain.  I called the owner, a sweet-sounding old man with a thick Southern drawl, and reserved the bottom floor.  The next day, I collected the few possessions I had and drove over to the farmstead.\n\nThe old man was waiting for me at the main house.  He looked like what I had imagined; dirty jeans, old boots, a big belly, and a long gray beard that matched his cotton shirt.  I parked and headed over to greet him.\n\n\u201cHowdy,\u201d he nodded at me as I walked over to him.\n\n\u201cHello!\u201d I answered, forcing any ounce of charisma I could muster into my tone.  \u201cI\u2019m Melissa.  Your property is beautiful!\u201d\n\nHe extended his hand, \u201cEli.  And thank you.\u201d  I dropped my bags to welcome his handshake.  \u201cShe\u2019s not what she used to be, but she\u2019s home.\u201d\n\nHe knelt to grab my bags.  \u201cOh, you don\u2019t need to do that.  It\u2019s not that much,\u201d I told him, but he shook his head and picked them up anyway.\n\n\u201cWhere you\u2019re stayin\u2019 is around back,\u201d he said as he started to walk that way.  \u201cSorry, but I don\u2019t have a driveway over to it yet.  You\u2019re welcome to drive \u2018round and park in the grass if you\u2019d like.\u201d\n\nThere was no way my beater could drive through the tall grass.  \u201cThat\u2019s alright, I don\u2019t mind walking.\u201d\n\nThe duplex was less than fifty yards away from the main house and there was a worn path through the tall grass to get there.  It was vertically symmetrical with the windows in the same places for the first and second floor.  The second floor window looked to not have any glass.  It looked smaller than in the photos, but I was looking forward to the serenity of nighttime on a farm.  He unlocked the front door and flipped the lights on.  It smelled of hay, manure, and wood; something I would have to get used to.  To my right, there was an old tube TV on a cabinet with a dusty recliner pointed at it.  Behind that was the bathroom, and behind that was the bedroom.  The kitchen was along the back wall.  To my left was a ladder leading right up to a hatch in the ceiling.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked Eli, pointing to the ladder.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way upstairs for now.  I\u2019ll be adding a door and steps upstairs to the back of the place eventually, just haven\u2019t gotten \u2018round to it.\u201d  He dropped my bags in the center of the room.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry, no one else is living here yet, and I don\u2019t plan on renting the upstairs out until I\u2019ve finished the other entrance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d I said as I continued to look around the space.  \u201cDid you just turn this into a living space recently?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d he answered.  \u201cMy granddad turned this place from a barn into a house many years ago for some distant cousins.  Twins, apparently.  I didn\u2019t know any of them very well, I just inherited this place a couple years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry for your loss,\u201d I said, but he shook his head.\n\n\u201cAh, I wasn\u2019t very close to my folks after eighteen,\u201d he huffed.  \u201cI wasn\u2019t much into farming, but as I\u2019ve gotten older, the more appealing it\u2019s been.  My parents worked tirelessly to try and keep this farm as big and profitable as my granddad did, but they struggled.  Since I had made a small farm of my own, I thought when I inherited this place that I could make it work, but I\u2019ve struggled just like they did.  That\u2019s why I\u2019m renting out the place,\u201d he said as he shrugged.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure running a farm is incredibly difficult, especially by yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he paused.  He looked around the room a bit before continuing, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be so bad if it weren\u2019t for something messing with my crops and killing livestock.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me, \u201cNow I don\u2019t mean to scare you.  I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just a few coyotes, and the livestock are all the way past the house on the other side.\u201d\n\nHis attempt to comfort me was appreciated, but I was starting to feel like this was a mistake.  I would stay there for as long as I had to, but I\u2019d continue looking elsewhere.  I guess that was a positive of renting from this man, as there was no contract and I just paid every month.  \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine,\u201d I said, trying to match his affirmation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have much of any livestock anymore, just a couple cattle and a few chicks, so I don\u2019t think it should be much issue,\u201d he handed me the key and stepped out the front door.  \u201cIf you need anything \u2013 anything \u2013 just call me or come knocking.  Don\u2019t be shy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you very much,\u201d I told him as he walked back to his house.  I walked around the space a bit before unpacking my bags and accustoming myself to my new home.\n\nThat evening, I sat in the recliner and browsed on my phone for other places to stay.  I looked for hours, expanding the boundary further and further away, but couldn\u2019t find anywhere I could afford.  I even contemplated posting online for roommates, but after getting evicted due to the last one and the thought of living with a stranger, I would just as rather risk being eaten by the coyotes.\n\nIt had gotten late, and I could already start to smell the dew on the grass outside.  When I got up to go to bed, the floor creaked loudly with every step.  It sounded like the entire house groaned for every move I made.  I didn\u2019t remember the house being this noisy earlier, but perhaps the silence of the evening made it that much more noticeable.  I made my way to bed, but hardly slept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next morning as I walked back to my car, I saw Eli carrying a shovel over to the barn.  I waved to him, but he must not have seen me.  He disappeared inside and I left for work.\n\nWhen I returned that evening, Eli was sitting on the porch smoking.  He nodded to me as I got out of my car.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d I called over to him.  I could tell he had had just as long a day as I\u2019d had.  \u201cLong day?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame as always,\u201d he said and smiled.  \u201cDoes misery love company?\u201d\n\nI laughed.  \u201cIndeed, it does,\u201d I answered.  I walked over to him and we talked for an hour or so about our lives, growing up, and how we got to where we are.  He was sweet and genuine, listening intently and sharing his own stories.  It was exactly what we needed.\n\n\u201cSo am I the first person to stay here?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cActually, I had one other lady stay here before you.  She was probably \u2018bout your age.  She didn\u2019t stay very long, though.  We had a bit of an argument early on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWell, she had rented out the bottom floor, but she let her sister stay on the top floor without talkin\u2019 with me first.\u201d  He sighed.  \u201cI should\u2019ve just let it go since I\u2019m still not ready to rent that top floor out, but it just seemed poor manners.  I brought it up to her kindly at first and she just kept denying it.  But I would see them both standing at the windows together, one in the bottom and one in the top window, staring at me.  I saw them several times over the course of a couple weeks doin\u2019 that.\u201d  He sighed again.  \u201cThey were odd ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s definitely rude,\u201d I replied.  \u201cI don\u2019t blame you.\u201d\n\nHe smiled at me.  \u201cWell, it\u2019s late.  It\u2019s \u2018bout time we go to bed.\u201d  He got up and headed inside.  \u201cGoodnight,\u201d he called out as he closed the door behind him.\n\n\u201cGoodnight,\u201d I answered as I walked around the house and back to the duplex.\n\nAs I stepped inside, I noticed the loud creaking again.  With each step, a squeak echoed around the house.  It took me walking to the bedroom to notice that each creak under my feet sounded again right above me.  I rocked back and forth to make sure I was hearing it right, and with each shift, the thud echoed upstairs.  Was someone up there? I wondered.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d I called out, but no one answered.\n\nWas the sister still living up there?  I tip-toed over to the ladder, each squeak upstairs matching my steps.  No, it must just be something with how this place was constructed, I assured myself.  I stared up at the hatch, contemplating taking a peek.  Maybe it\u2019s best I wait until morning.  I sat in the recliner that night, staring at the ladder.  I may have dozed off a time or two, but it was another night of poor sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn\u2019t see Eli in the morning, or I would\u2019ve asked him to investigate the second floor for me.  I went off to work but left early to check out the second floor before it got too dark.  When I came back, Eli was back near the barn with a shovel, covered in dirt and sweat.  I waved at him again, but he didn\u2019t see me.\n\nWhen I got to the duplex, I stepped around a few times to see if the creaks were echoing upstairs, but they weren\u2019t anymore.  I turned on my phone\u2019s flashlight and climbed the ladder.  I found the light switch and flicked it on.  The second floor was identical to the first floor.  Everything was exactly the same except for the missing windowpane in the front of the house, adjacent to the ladder.  I crept over to the kitchen to see if there was anything to cover the window with, but all the drawers were empty.  Then I noticed the bedroom door was closed.  I tried to open it, but the door was locked.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d I called out as I knocked on the bedroom door, but no response.  If someone had been living on the second floor, they didn\u2019t have any belongings.  The only way out that I wouldn\u2019t notice would be the open window, but there would be no way back in without a ladder.  They might have been sneaking in and out midday while I was at work, but surely Eli would\u2019ve seen an intruder.\n\nI went back downstairs to find something to cover the window with.  Despite how late it was, I decided to call Eli to ask him about the upstairs bedroom.  I found a spare sheet under the bed as Eli picked up.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cHey Eli, it\u2019s Melissa.  I\u2019m sorry to bother you so late, but I was checking out the second floor and noticed the bedroom door up there is locked.  Is there a reason?\u201d\n\nHe grumbled a bit to make it more obvious I had woken him up.  \u201cHuh?  There\u2019s no lock on the bedroom doors.\u201d\n\nI froze for a moment, then pressed one foot down.  The creak echoed upstairs just like the night before.  I took another step and it echoed again.\n\n\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Eli said as he hung up the phone.\n\nI froze.  The only sound I could hear was the crickets outside.  I dropped the sheet and sprinted towards the kitchen.  The thuds and creaks I made were equally matched above.  I grabbed a knife from the drawer and ran to the ladder.  Again, every thump matched me in step.  I climbed up and put my hand on the trapdoor, pausing for a moment to prepare myself, before bursting through.\n\nThere was no one.  I rocked back and forth, listening to the creaks coming from below my feet and above my head.  Then I stomped a couple of times and it echoed loudly, but it still sounded like it was coming from above.  It must just be how this place is constructed, how the sound bounces around or how the frame moves, I told myself.  But then I noticed the bedroom door was open.  I took a couple steps towards the bedroom and peered inside: empty.  Strange, but I was relieved.  I guess the door opened when I was stomping around.\n\nMy phone rang.  It was Eli.  \u201cHello?\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI was just looking around upstairs.  There were some noises and the bedroom door opened so I-\u201d but he cut me off.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said.  \u201cWhy are you on the roof?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing on the roof?  Why were you stomping on it?\u201d\n\nI froze again.  My mind raced.  I stared at the open window above the ladder.  \u201cAre you in your room?\u201d I asked.  I couldn\u2019t see the house through the window at the angle I was at, so he shouldn\u2019t have been able to see me.\n\n\u201cOf course, I was in bed,\u201d he answered.\n\nI raised my hand and waved.\n\n\u201cYes, hello!\u201d Eli said.  \u201cI see you!\u201d\n\nI dropped my knife and jumped down the hatch.  I grabbed my keys, got in my car, and never went back.  I left the few things I had behind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEli called me the next day and insisted I answer him as to why I was on the roof.  I tried explaining that it wasn\u2019t me, that someone or something else lived there, but he wouldn\u2019t listen.  Before we got off the phone, he asked me why there were blood and feathers in the upstairs bedroom.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answered, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think you have coyotes, I don\u2019t think the woman who lived there before me had a sister, and I don\u2019t think your cousin had a twin.\u201d",

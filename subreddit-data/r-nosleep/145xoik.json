Unfortunately, not everyone else did.\n\n----------------\n\n\u201cI never should have married you,\u201d Kimmy sighed as she leaned back against her Corolla.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the reassurance I wanted from the love of my life. [But considering how shitty the night had been, the news wasn\u2019t particularly shocking](https://redd.it/13z778h).\n\nShe smiled, and it was just the saddest thing. \u201cYou know how you won me over, Russ?\u201d she asked, her wavy hair falling over an elfish year in a way that always made my breath hitch.\n\n\u201cI have to give myself credit,\u201d I responded, forcing a grin. \u201cHow many people would save a stranger from a barfight?\u201d\n\nHer eyes drifted awkwardly to the side.\n\n\u201c\u2026you said that winning the fight was the sexiest thing you\u2019d ever seen.\u201d\n\nKimmy\u2019s eyes slid further.\n\nAn awkward silence hung.\n\n\u201cDo you know how big that guy was who wanted to kick your ass for flirting with me?\u201d she pressed, finally interrupting the crickets.\n\nI shrugged. \u201cAbout my height, I think.\u201d\n\nKimmy wrinkled her nose. \u201cNo, that was his friend. He came in to help the collegiate defensive tackle with arms as thick as your head.\u201d\n\nI squirmed. \u201cI thought the guy who punched me was the only other person in the fight.\u201d\n\nKimmy wrinkled her forehead. \u201cThat guy just wanted in on the asskicking you were about to get.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 what happened to Mr. Defensive Tackle?\u201d I pressed, confused.\n\nShe raised an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cWait \u2013 did you cripple him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI found out later that he never played football again.\u201d She scratched her nose. \u201cI actually don\u2019t feel guilty.\u201d\n\nI nodded slowly. \u201cSo you were impressed with how I beat up his shitbag friend?\u201d\n\nShe pursed her lips.\n\nMy jaw fell. \u201cDid you do your paralyzing trick on him just before he and I fought?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were going to get pounded through the floor, Russ!\u201d she answered defensively. \n\n\u201cI could have held my own,\u201d I whispered.\n\n\u201cHe was half-paralyzed and you still *barely* beat him.\u201d She folded her arms.\n\nI stared down at my crossed legs. \u201cSo everything was a lie from day one. You never liked me at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not *true,* Russ!\u201d she shot back, grabbing two fistfuls of her hair in frustration. \u201cHow do you not get it by now?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe the lying has confused me!\u201d I shot back, my heart racing.\n\nShe covered her face. Kimmy looked so small in that moment; I had always felt like her protector, and it crushed me to know that she had never needed it. \n\n\u201cI liked you *because* you were going to get your ass kicked, and you flew to my side anyway. I thought it was cute. I thought *you* were cute.\u201d\n\nWe paused.\n\n\u201cWell, I guess I am kind of charming, from a certain point of view.\u201d\n\nWe looked at each other. Pissed as I was, she still made my heart flutter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to marry outside of our kind,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo I told myself that I wasn\u2019t falling for you, that it was only a fling. But you were always so desperate for just *one* more date.\u201d\n\nI shrugged. \u201cYou were the hottest girl I\u2019d ever gone out with. I wanted to keep seeing you.\u201d\n\nHer nostrils flared. \u201cI know. And it caught me by surprise when that approach made *me* want to keep seeing *you*.\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cMy Tribe had been in this town 106 years when you and I got married in 2019. Our current matron is a woman named Charybdis. When I told her that you and I were getting married, she nearly excommunicated me.\u201d Kimmy rubbed her upper arms, glancing around, anxious. \u201cI was advised not to have children \u2013 and that if I did, and that child had Abilities, that I would have to take the baby and leave you.\u201d\n\nA chill settled in my stomach. \u201cAnd if the baby couldn\u2019t do your\u2026  magic shit?\u201d\n\nHer face went blank. \u201cThen I would have to surrender it to Charybdis for a Devouring.\u201d\n\nI wanted to puke. \u201cDoes that mean-\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly what it sounds like.\u201d\n\n\u201cShit.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nKimmy took in a deep breath before staring up at the dark sky. Though she sat just a few feet away from me, my wife was half-obscured in shadow as the moon revealed only what parts of her it saw fit. \u201cI told myself that I wouldn\u2019t get pregnant. Then,\u201d her voice trembled, \u201cI *did* get pregnant, and everything changed.\u201d She blinked quickly. \u201cSometimes, there are only wrong answers, and you have to pick what burns your loved ones the least.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that means you were never going to feed Ella to your Tribe.\u201d\n\nKimmy glared at me. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you were just going to wait and see if she had Abilities, then run out on me either way.\u201d\n\nHer face melted in sadness. \u201cWhat better decision could I have made?\u201d she asked, her voice pleading.\n\nI folded my arms. \u201cYou could have told me the truth, and we\u2019d have run away together, Kim!\u201d\n\nShe closed her eyes and shook her head, wavy hair bouncing. \u201cThey would have chased us, and you\u2019d have gotten your ass kicked immediately, Russ. What\u2019s the point in starting a lifetime journey that would kill you in one night?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause some things are worth getting your ass kicked for!\u201d I shouted, rising to my feet. \u201cIn high school, all I did was play video games and gobble bean burritos six hours a day. Do you know the last time I played a video game?\u201d\n\n\u201cYesterday,\u201d she deadpanned. \n\n\u201cYeah, but for only like twenty minutes! Kimmy, I *can\u2019t* go back to a time before you and Ella were the greatest inconveniences in my life!\u201d\n\nThe dappled moonlight couldn\u2019t hide her beaming smile. I wanted that fact to make me happy. But a chill crawled up my spine from the inside, licking the crevices between each vertebra as it worked its way into my skull. The fear lapped like a cat, just like a hungry cat, at the vulnerable folds of my brain. Kimmy\u2019s smile turned to abject horror. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to turn around. If my wife and daughter weren\u2019t nearby, I\u2019m sure I would have died browning my underpants as I ran away screaming. \n\nBut I had to face what was behind me. \n\nMy heart didn\u2019t just fall; it melted. The creature almost would have been human if it didn\u2019t have a circular wound where her mouth should have been; it looked like a vertical Sarlacc pit. When she spoke, her words made me feel like I was receiving an unsolicited rimjob from a snowman.\n\n\u201cTouching story,\u201d she clucked. \u201cRidiculous, but touching.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuss,\u201d Kimmy whispered in a voice that sounded like cracking glass, \u201cit\u2019s Charybdis.\u201d\n\nI wanted to say something clever, but my mouth wouldn\u2019t make the words go.\n\n\u201cWe had an agreement,\u201d Charybdis croak-slurped. \u201cIt will be honored, with or without your consent.\u201d\n\nMy world changed as she stepped closer, casting moonlight over her full figure. Satan only knows what supernatural abilities this thing had, because she had taken our daughter without either of us noticing, and now held a sleeping Ella in her arms.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Kimmy begged, too broken for tears.\n\n\u201cI have a right to the child,\u201d Charybdis pressed, stepping closer. \u201cAre you going to resist, Kim \u2013 or will you make a prudent choice for the first time in your life?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook \u2013 I don\u2019t know what fucked-up supernatural methods you\u2019ll use to beat the shit out of me, though I know it\u2019s going to suck,\u201d I roared, afraid of my own false bravery. \u201cBut you have *no* right to my daughter.\u201d\n\nCharybdis cocked her head. \u201cKim? He seems confused. Can you explain to him why I very much have a right to this child?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t want to take my eyes off of Charybdis \u2013 but even without looking behind me, I could tell that Kimmy was hyperventilating. \n\nI clenched my fists, praying that Ella would stay asleep as I died. \n\n\u201cRuss,\u201d Kimmy gasped, her words coming in short bursts, \u201cShe\u2019s been hunting for Ella since she was born.

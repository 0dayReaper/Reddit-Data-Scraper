    "postText": "This summer, I decided to get my DNA sequenced by 23andme. I wanted to know my ancestry, as well as find out if I'm a carrier for any genetic disorders, since my husband and I want to try and get pregnant soon.\n\nWhen the results came back, everything was what I expected. I was Romanian and German. I had the sun-sneeze reflex. Etc. The surprise came when I clicked on the \"Relatives\" tab. At the top of the list, it showed my parents.\n\nExcept, there weren't two parents.\n\nThere were *three*.\n\n**John T.**\n\n*Father, 50.0% DNA shared*\n\n**Agnes T.**\n\n*Mother, 50.0% DNA shared*\n\n**G**\n\n*Mother, 50.0% DNA shared*\n\nI stared at the last one. *Uh\u2026 what?* I scrolled up and down the list, but the rest looked normal. One of my brothers came up, along with an aunt and some cousins.\n\nCurious, I clicked on G's profile. But there wasn't any other information. To see details, like her ancestry or shared relatives, I'd need to 'connect' with her.\n\n*Probably just a glitch or something. Or maybe my mom made two accounts by accident.* I closed my laptop and tried to forget about it.\n\nBut for the rest of the day, it bothered me. Like a little itch in the back of my brain. *Maybe it isn't a duplicate account or a total glitch. Maybe she's some secret aunt or something, and 23andme just overestimated the shared DNA.* I'd read the horror stories, of 23andme uncovering family secrets like that.\n\nSo that evening, I decided to hit \"Connect.\" I didn't really expect her to accept.\n\nBut just a few days later, she did.\n\nI went over to the 23andme website, my heart pounding. When I scrolled down, I saw my ancestry composition and G\u2019s, side-by-side. Her ancestry looked like my mom\u2019s\u2014almost 100% Romanian. But\u2026 it was slightly different.\n\nMy heart pounded faster. I opened three tabs: my mom\u2019s ancestry, my dad\u2019s, G\u2019s, and mine. My eyes darted between them, comparing them. Studying them. And after several minutes, I realized it.\n\nI was 1% Scandinavian. But neither my mother nor my father had any Scandinavian ancestry.\n\nOnly \u201cG\u201d did.\n\nA chill went down my spine. I stared at G\u2019s profile. At her empty profile picture.\n\n*Who* is *she?*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI told my husband all about it. He thought I was overreacting. \u201cIt\u2019s just some glitch,\u201d he said, as he flipped the chicken on the stove. \u201c23andme must\u2019ve sequenced the DNA wrong, or mixed up the samples, or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s creepy though, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d He opened the cabinet, rummaging around for plates. \u201cBut there\u2019s just so much room for error with that DNA stuff.\u201d\n\nI tried not to think about it. But my night was plagued with nightmares of G\u2014a faceless woman, calling from the forest. Who had my long dark hair and tall stature. A second mother who, somehow, had given me her DNA.\n\nWhen I woke up, though, I realized something. If I shared 50% of my DNA with my father, and my mother, *and* G\u2014well, 50% + 50% + 50% did not equal 100%.\n\nOne of my parents had to share DNA with G.\n\nI called my mom on the way to work. \u201cDid you see anyone listed in your DNA relatives named \u2018G\u2019?\u201d I asked, as I pulled onto the highway.\n\n\u201cG?\u201d she repeated.\n\n\u201cYeah. There\u2019s just\u2026 a person named G who keeps popping up on my DNA relatives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know. The website is kind of hard to use. Brandon was helping me with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cCould you ask\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, sure. Gotta go now, though.\u201d\n\nWith that being a dead end, I decided to bite the bullet and send G a message. Most likely, it\u2019d be some big misunderstanding. G was probably some stranger living on the other end of the country with no connection to me whatsoever.\n\n**Hey, I noticed 23andme listed you as a relative. Do you have any family members with the last name T--- or K---, especially in the northwest US? Are you related to my mother, Agnes T---?**\n\nThe response came less than an hour later. And when I read it, a slow chill ran down my spine.\n\n**you will find out soon enough.**\n\nThat was the whole thing. The whole response. Those cryptic six words. I quickly shot a message back: **Are you related to me? Or my mom?**\n\nNo answer.\n\nI stared at the screen, my heart pounding. Then, in one swift motion, I moved my cursor up and removed her as a connection. *Just a troll. A scammer. Something weird like that.*\n\nA few days later, I checked 23andme again\u2014to find that G had removed her account. Or, possibly, that the glitch had been fixed. Because G was no longer listed as my mother, or a relative at all.\n\nWeeks went by and I forgot about the whole thing. Work got busy, gardening season was in full swing, and my hours were spent either working late in the office or slaving over my plant babies. I didn\u2019t even give G a second thought\u2014\n\nUntil, one morning, it all came crashing down.\n\nTwo pink lines. My husband and I spent the morning crying, hugging each other, overjoyed about this little person we would bring into the world.\n\nUntil I went to the mailbox.\n\nInside was a folded piece of pink paper, tied off with black ribbon. No stamp\u2014it must\u2019ve been hand delivered. My throat went dry as I flipped it open and read the words on the page.\n\n**meet me at d--- park at midnight tonight.**\n\n**-G**\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/146m2ef/23andme_says_i_have_a_second_mother_part_2/)",

Shielding was not what it is today. There is a chance that being exposed to all that radiation neonatally could have affected my DNA. Also my Grandpa on my Dads side worked with radiation for the DOD(we think, most of his projects are still classified); and while there are none of the genetic markers for cancer in the family, my Dad and one of his sisters both died of the same type of blood cancer... Linked to low dose radiation poisoning. \n\nI have a feeling has more people do DNA testing we're going to find out that having like 0.05% non-human DNA or what we think is human DNA is going to be more common. Right now the testing pool is still really small. And the human genome itself is really long to sequence all of so it could be like in different parts of people's DNA because when you do any of the DNA testing kits they're always just looking at just certain parts not your whole sequence. \n\nIt's just like we used to think there was only X and Y chromosomes and that you either 100% XX or 100% XY and now we know that chromosomes are way more complex than that and that it's possible for people to have chromosomes from both sexes and still be one sex.  The fun fact is we are always learning.",

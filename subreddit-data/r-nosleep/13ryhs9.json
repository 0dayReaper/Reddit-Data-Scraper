    "postText": "Does anyone remember Kyran Bridge? I must be losing my mind. Lately i\u2019ve been stuck in an endless void of confusion, drowning in the loss of hope and questioning my own sanity. Growing up as a child was tough. My dad passed away when I was 13 due to a brain tumour, and so I grew up with a single parent, who\u2019d spend most of her nights crying and getting drunk off wine. I was bullied a lot in school,  kids would pick on me because I was lonely and antisocial - and i\u2019m not talking about the usual, generic bullying. They\u2019d have a game they\u2019d like to call \u201cThe Silent Treatment\u201d, which had a self-explanatory purpose to see how long the class could go on without talking to me. It wasn\u2019t physical torture but psychological torture. I was left out and depressed, with no one to talk to about my problems. It was as if life had forced me onto an edge, and there was no escape but to plummet and pray. But that all changed when a new neighbour, not too far away, moved in. He had messy blonde hair, blue glasses, and a small scar just above his right (my right) eyebrow. His name was Kyran Bridge, and he had recently joined the school a week before Christmas break. It was at lunchtime before silent whispers spread about the game they\u2019d play on me, and I was pretty certain Kyran had overheard and may have obliged to these social morals; or at least I thought so. Later that day in P.E, i was instructed to retrieve the footballs (soccer balls in the US) from the forest behind the astro turf, as it wasn\u2019t uncommon for someone to kick one over. Not that I was complaining, I wasn\u2019t doing much that evening and despite the cold climate, the forest behind the school can be quite pretty in the autumn. It came as a surprise when i met Kyran.\n\nI spoke up in desperate hope.\n\n\u201cHey, I understand if you don\u2019t want to talk to me like the others, but i\u2019m human, and if you want a mate to get you settled in i\u2019m here for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI appreciate that, thank you, and the others are stupid. I completely understand you. You must get trampled on a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I suppose so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got that a lot before I moved here, I was always in the way of everyone, but here I\u2019ve only met nice people like you so far.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, I appreciate that a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you live here with your mum?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, she's been a bit down lately, but she\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\n\"And your dad?\u201d\n\nSuddenly, it went silent.\n\n\u201cTopic you don\u2019t want to talk about, Harrison?\u201d\n\nMy stomach sank. My name was Harley, Harrison was the name my mum called me. I didn\u2019t bring it up, I reinstated my name was Harley, but he carried on calling me that anyway. I got used to it. From then, things got better. I had a shoulder to cry on and my mum found a new boyfriend, we spent a lot more time together and for once I felt happy. Everyone forgot about the game they played on me and me and Kyran and I found ourselves into a large friendship group (me, Kyran, James, and Kyle). We stayed up late nights, got drunk, high, and found ourselves crashing parties, just the average teenage things. This continued for 5 years. However, I noticed that over the years Kyran became quieter, it became difficult to talk to him. He stopped hanging around with us as much. I told my mum, and she said I was being ridiculous, that she hasn\u2019t seen him for years except the average couple times she\u2019s walked past him. Eventually, we all left for college and made our own ways, I found a loving girlfriend and graduated college. But that\u2019s when things turned grey. Kyle has been arrested for drink driving and manslaughter, as well as possession of marijuana. My loving girlfriend I told you about, I found she cheated on me with James, who was coincidentally my manager for our business we set up together and I was fired after he found my replacement. My mum has recently been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer due to smoking habits and has been given only a few months to live. I figured, what I need is someone by my side. But it seems like no one is there for me. Everyone is leaving or has left. That\u2019s when I was reminded of Kyran. I recall the last words he said to me - \n\n\u201cIf you get lost, i\u2019m here for you, always.\u201d \n\nWell that\u2019s it, i\u2019m officially lost. I thought i\u2019d find him easily, but this is the freaky part. No one seems to remember Kyran. It\u2019s like he disappeared. My mum denies ever knowing of the boy and the old neighbours across the road swear they have lived there since before I was born and have never seen a boy of sort around. Its not like anyone can forget him, he has seen practically everybody that went to our school and was the reason our friendship group broke up - but even they say they don\u2019t remember a 4th member in our group. There was no trace he ever existed - his place in the year book was a blank and the school documents (yes, I even went that far to look for him) of a Kyran were non existent. But why does no one remember him? What happened? How come I do? Then, one night, I hear something. A crying. It was 12 at night, I was pretty startled and refused to step out my door, blaming my imagination and trying to sleep. But the longer I was awake, the more I realised how realistic these cries for help were. Opening my door, I see a pool of running blood trailing down my stairs into the kitchen. I shouted downstairs - \n\n\u201cHELLO!? ARE YOU OKAY?\u201d\n\nBut no response. Just endless agonising screams. It got louder as I followed, i\u2019m pretty sure I heard a few people screaming, but that of i\u2019m not so sure. I was petrified. The blood trail leads through the kitchen towards my dining room. The screaming stopped, and what I saw next haunted me. In the mirror wasn't me. It was Kyran. He was pale, had no teeth, and had large round lifeless eyes. His scar streaming with blood. He just looked at me, smiling, pointing to a picture of the 4 of us in the forest together, our chill out spot, the water below our feet. That\u2019s where i\u2019ll find Kyran Bridge. That\u2019s where i\u2019ll lose all my troubles. That\u2019s where, finally, I can be free. I saw the sign, and I saw him. Kyran Bridge greeted me, i\u2019ve never been so happy to see something all my life. I held him tight, and I spoke -\n\n\u201cGoodbye.\u201d\n\n30 meters below the bridge, my freedom awaits.",

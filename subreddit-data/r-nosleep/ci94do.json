    "postText": "\nI moved in with my boyfriend yesterday. We\u2019ve been together for 5 years now and we\u2019re old and wise enough to settle down and finally leave our parents houses. He just turned 24 and I\u2019m 22. He\u2019s the love of my life. His name is Jamie and I couldn\u2019t be happier to be living with him. \n\nWhen we decided to make the leap we spent 2 months looking at flats and houses, we couldn\u2019t afford to buy yet so renting was our only option but the prices were astronomical. For our budget we would have been lucky to get a box room and a stove.\n\nJamie works for a local 24 hour fast food restaurant and I\u2019m training to be a teacher. The early stages of training don\u2019t pay much and I owe a lot in student loans so finances are tough. \n\nWe had almost given up hope until we found our flat. It was nothing special, but to us it was a palace. A spacious 2 bedroom apartment with views of a city park, a balcony and local conveniences. It was in a tower block in a not so nice area, but neither of us had been wealthy growing up, we weren\u2019t fussy. Just grateful to be together. \n\nThe advert was sweetened by the deposit free option and open ended tenancy. The landlord was happy to sign a five year contract if we wanted. That sort of thing never happens in the city. We were told that along with no deposit we would also have no inspections, but would be liable to pay for any damage when we ended the tenancy. I\u2019d never heard of anything quite like it.\n\nWe knew that for our budget and location we weren\u2019t going to get any better. We snapped the place up fast, not even bothering to view it. It felt like our only chance. \n\nMove in day rolled around quickly and yesterday we got the keys to our first home together, it was such a strange feeling. The day was chaos, getting our stuff in and up in the lift. We were flat number 42, on the 7th floor. The items we couldn\u2019t get in the lift had to be taken up all the stairs by the removal men. I think they were grateful we weren\u2019t any higher but I still wish we had been able to give them a better tip. \n\nIn the evening we settled down on our second hand sofa, given to us by a cousin of a friend and watched some tv. We smoked cigarettes on the balcony looking at the park and fell asleep on our mattress on the floor super early because we had no energy to put the bed together yet and Jamie had work at a hideous time of the morning. \n\nWe slept soundly last night, I felt safe and happy. I don\u2019t think that feeling is coming back any time soon and it\u2019s all due to the note I found this morning. \n\nI found it in the kitchen, having a coffee, hours after Jamie had left for his early shift at work. It was in one of the cupboards that were fixed to the wall, there were a bunch of useful items from the previous tenant. Spare keys to the flat, a set of tiny keys that locked and unlocked the windows (necessary for those with kids this high up), spare smoke alarm batteries and a folded up piece of paper. \n\nThe note was handwritten with \u201cNew occupier of flat 42\u201d in beautiful cursive on the blank side. I opened it up and sat down to read. I can\u2019t really describe it to you, so I\u2019m going to copy it out below. \n\n*Dear New Occupier,*\n\n*Firstly, welcome to your new home. I lived here before you for 35 years with my husband. Unfortunately he had an incident at home recently that I\u2019d rather not discuss that claimed his life. My sister has now decided I can\u2019t keep up with the demands of the property and has insisted that I move in with her and her husband. I was reluctant at first, but the stairs do kill me at my age and without Bernie it\u2019s filled with sadness.*\n\n*Anyway. When you\u2019ve lived somewhere for as long as I have it feels like a person that you know. You understand it\u2019s personality and what makes it tick. I thought it was probably pertinent that I impart some of that knowledge on you.*\n\n*It\u2019s a wonderful home, honestly, I have lived through best and worst years and leaving it behind is very emotional but if you are to survive and get the best out of it then there are some steps you need to follow.*\n\n*1. The landlord will never bother you, he doesn\u2019t visit, call or communicate in any way. But make sure to pay your rent in a timely fashion always. I have only dealt with him once in 35 years and let\u2019s just say I never missed another rent day. Any repairs required you speak to the agent you rented the place with.*\n\n*2. DO NOT use the communal lift between 1.11 and 3.33 am. Just don\u2019t do it. This step is vital if you are to have a happy life here. It really is life or death. Don\u2019t do it. This has cost me and many others in the building greatly and I would rather not elaborate on why you shouldn\u2019t do this. Just please don\u2019t do it. I cannot stress this enough.*\n\n*3. When you hear the strange animal noises coming from flat 48 don\u2019t question it, Mr Prentice lives there and he\u2019s a lovely chap. Don\u2019t be afraid to say hello to him in the corridor or on the stairs (he\u2019s old school, so he never risks the lift) but whatever you do, don\u2019t check on him when you hear the noises. You\u2019ll know when you hear them.*\n\n*4. If you ever come across a window cleaner on the balcony ignore him. He may seem like the nicest fellow you\u2019ve ever had trying to sell you something at the door but it really is best that you don\u2019t engage. He will go away if you ignore him. But he tries pretty hard the first few times so you\u2019ll need some resilience. Whatever you do, don\u2019t offer him anything. No money, no hot drink.*\n\n*5. Don\u2019t leave food scraps out. Bin or refrigerate them immediately. If you have small animals, it is imperative that you watch them eat and take away any leftover food immediately after they are done. This and rule 2 go hand in hand, the things forage all day and seem to really love animal feed. You don\u2019t want them in your flat. I promise. You can leave what you want out between 1.11 and 3.33am so you may want to feed your pets then.*\n\n*6. Don\u2019t communicate with any neighbours who claim to come from flats 65-72. These flats suffered a fire in the late 80s that devastated the whole floor, all the residents died in their homes. The building was mostly council owned at the time and they never bothered to renovate the flats. They\u2019ve been empty ever since but every now and again someone will knock at your door claiming to live in one of these flats and ask to borrow some sugar. They will seem entirely average but you must shut and lock the door immediately. I installed two extra security bolts to avoid these fuckers. I don\u2019t like to swear at my age but they really are fuckers.*\n\n*7. Simple one for you here, keep a weapon in each room. Sometimes you follow all these steps and something still slips through the net. Better to be safe than sorry.*\n\n*8. The building has a committee that will try and get you to join. It\u2019s one of those neighbours groups about improving living conditions for all residents. It\u2019s a nice group and the lady who runs it - Terri from flat 26- is a fantastic neighbour. By all means get involved. But I wouldn\u2019t recommend babysitting Terri\u2019s 2 children. She\u2019ll ask you, because the poor woman needs a break, but if you accept don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.*\n\n*9. Stray hairless cats sometimes roam in the hallway. I know they\u2019re supposedly a special, expensive breed, but they don\u2019t belong to anyone. They\u2019re mostly  harmless, but don\u2019t pick them up. Not unless you see one of those neighbours that claims to live in 65-72. Then grab the cat and lock it inside with you. It\u2019ll burn your skin a little but the cats are friendly and I wouldn\u2019t want to see them hurt.*\n\n*10. There is no way to fix the damp patch on the ceiling in the bedroom. Sometimes it will turn a deep crimson and look quite concerning, but please try not to be alarmed, it doesn\u2019t drip, it doesn\u2019t get any bigger and it\u2019s been there longer than I have. The landlord won\u2019t budge on it, according the the agents. I flagged it many times, even called the police the first night it changed colour, but it was a waste of time and it will be for you too. It\u2019s best to ignore it.*\n\n*11. You can trust the postman. His name is Ian Flanders and he\u2019s been the postman since before I moved in. He has his own key to the main door and delivers post to the door every morning at 8.54. I can\u2019t include everything here, or it would become a novel but if you have any questions Ian will help you.*\n\n*12. Finally, the first few weeks are the worst. You\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve made a mistake, I\u2019m sure reading this you already do, but if you can get through the first few weeks it really is a lovely block to live in. Every property has it quirks and this one is a little extra special, but you can be truly happy here if you just take my advice. I wish you all the best, I really do.*\n\n*Yours truly*, \n\n*Mrs Prudence Hemmings*\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to think after reading the note. Hopefully it was some sort of joke but the agent had said the previous tenant was an elderly lady and I can\u2019t see anyone named Prudence Hemmings attempting to play practical jokes on someone they\u2019d never met. \n\nThere were also parts of the note I couldn\u2019t disprove, there was indeed a large damp patch above the bed that me and Jamie had already discussed reporting. No crimson but it definitely existed. I had also commented on a beautiful Sphynx cat roaming the halls as we were moving in. I started to get seriously freaked out.\n\nOur dream, our beautiful little home had just become a source of fear and confusion. I checked the time and it was 9.14. Damn it. Out of time to catch postman Ian. When I opened the door to check, sure enough, two letters addressed to a Mrs Hemmings sat on the doorstep. \n\nAt about 11.15 my worst fears were truly confirmed when a friendly middle aged looking man carrying window cleaning equipment knocked on my balcony door. I ignored him. I didn\u2019t want to take the risk until I\u2019d spoken to Jamie and showed him the note. I\u2019d texted him already to rush home. I felt bad as the man rapped his knuckles against the door for over 10 minutes, but honestly the longer it went on the more I was terrified. \n\nMy windows were sparkling, and due to our lack of curtains I couldn\u2019t even hide from his gaze. I felt so exposed. He stayed for a total of 30 minutes exactly and never once did he stop looking at me or knocking. He shouted the occasional ultra friendly line or humble request for a beverage in the heat through the door but I did my best to avoid eye contact. \n\nWhen he finally left I looked outside every window in the flat, but I couldn\u2019t see him on any of the other balconies or see any equipment suggesting he was around. He had vanished completely. \n\nJamie still hadn\u2019t text me back, he must have been having a rough shift, it was a Friday and they were always busy. It wasn\u2019t often that he didn\u2019t reply. He was due home in around an hour anyway.\n\nI read the note probably hundreds of times over, I tortured myself reading it for the next hour. Desperately waiting for Jamie to come through the door to tell me it was all crazy and I should relax. \n\nI hoped for that so much.\n\nBut Jamie never came. His shift should have finished around midday but by 2pm he still wasn\u2019t home. I panicked, I cried, I left over 100 voice messages on his phone but got nowhere. I finally decided it had been long enough that calling his work wouldn\u2019t embarrass him and his boss told me that he had never turned up for his shift. \n\nI thought about it, what could have happened?  And then it hit me. Jamie\u2019s shift started at 4am today. He would have left the flat at 3.15 and taken the lift down the stairs. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve tried to convince myself it was all just a big joke. Maybe Jamie wrote the note and got his boss in on it. A voice in my head kept telling me that he couldn\u2019t write like that if he tried but I had to attempt to fool myself. It\u2019s getting late and he still isn\u2019t home, what if it\u2019s all true?

Buy some extra Tupperware to put away your food. Get those weapons in every room. The suggestion of cast iron is a good one, lots of occult and supernatural things can't stand iron, and you can get a cast iron skillet or fire poker for every room easily enough. Get some curtains as well so you can ignore the window washer. Read the note over and over until you've committed all the rules to memory. It's going to be a rough 23 hours but talk to Ian. He'll help you out and if anyone knows how to save Jamie it will be him.",

Very old ones have extreme OCD and are compelled to untie knots or count and collect a spilled bag of small objects.\n\nBeans are typically on hand and roll and scatter in a large enough area to keep a vampire occupied and give you enough time to get away.\n\nIf you want to get fancy, visit a craft store and buy one of those large bags of little round beads.\n\nWhat's great is that the bags are often brightly colored and easily seen from a distance. Just wear it on your belt and the vamps will find something better to do with their evening.",

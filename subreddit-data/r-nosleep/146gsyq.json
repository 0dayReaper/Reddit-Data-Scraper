    "postText": "My name is Quentin Lorreno. I\u2019m somewhat of a middleman in the criminal underworld. I mediate the crime families, I arrange diplomatic marriages, I keep things civil.\n\nBut above all I buy and sell cursed artifacts. \n\nThese dissonant pieces of the world can be as anything as a shrunken head that gives you bad vibes to things as dangerous as paintings that squeeze the life out of you once you look at them.\n\nWhat my clients want with them, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t ask, and I don\u2019t tell- for the most part.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about UFOs.\n\nIn recent times sightings have increased and I\u2019m sure you, dear reader, have heard the commotion of the media and all the talk about them.\n\nWhistleblowers, leaks, court cases- all the like.\n\nInformation about alien spacecraft, intelligent aliens coming to visit- hell, even asteroids carrying data from other worlds, other systems. But let me tell you one thing: the people you call \u2018higher-ups\u2019 and the \u2018elites\u2019 barely know a thing about UFOs, much less alien life.\n\nBut I know pieces of alien starcraft are highly desired. And the fact that recovered debris and a ship itself can fetch prices so high you\u2019ll find yourself doubting your very eyes.\n\nThe artifact was in the center of the man\u2019s shop. A simple trader in the wet market, haggling with customers and overcharging tourists for the smallest things. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d I said, politely.\n\nHe turned to me and smiled, revealing a single gold tooth. \u201cAh, come my friend,\u201d he cheered, beckoning me inside. I followed; so did my assistant- and expert, Aster. \u201cWhat do you desire?\u201d he paused, and added, \u201cfriend.\u201d\n\nI observed the small artifact in the center of his shop. It was round, and inscribed with symbols I neither understood nor truly comprehended.\n\n\u201cI want this,\u201d I indicated. Despite the freezing rain of the wet market, the small spherical thing felt hot to the touch, and I drew back. \u201cAnd where\u2019d you find this?\u201d\n\n\u201cDown river, sir,\u201d he explained, vaguely gesturing to the roaring stream past the market. \u201cMy friend, the fishman found his nets. All fish in there, dead.\u201d\n\nI turned to my assistant. \u201cAster, can you verify?\u201d She nodded, slipped a leather glove off her hands and reached out into the ether.\n\nShe was a Canary- that\u2019s what we in the artifact business call those with heightened senses, those with powers of the interesting kind. She began to shiver and I laid out a hand on her shoulder as her eyes started to roll back- I feared for her every time she reached out.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s legitimate all right- not of this world.\u201d She closed her eyes, sighing. \u201cAnd he\u2019s telling the truth.\u201d\n\nI nodded to the shopkeeper. \u201cHow much for the er, magic sphere?\u201d\n\nHe thought, not entirely sure what to make of it. \u201cFive hundred dollars?\u201d \n\nI could get a better deal. \u201cThree hundred.\u201d\n\n\u201cFour-fifty.\u201d\n\nThat was acceptable. \u201cDeal!\u201d And I slid out my wallet and handed over cash. He seemed happy, and handed me the still-hot sphere. I nodded to him, and the two of us headed back out into the rain.\n\nThe moment the water hit the sphere it hissed and smoke trawled out. \u201cAgh!\u201d I yelped, the metal suddenly turning boiling-hot. It fell, and steam poured from the ground.\n\nAster, gloves on held it. \u201cHow much do you think we can sell this one for?\u201d\n\nThere were a few clients I had in mind. World governments, for one, charged more than they really needed to for alien artifacts. A representative from the U.S Department of Defense was a client I could easily phone. \n\nSo I thought. \u201cA few thousand,\u201d I assured. \u201cWorth the trip here.\u201d\n\nMe, Aster, and my bodyguard (where had he gone?) had traveled to the market to seek out old artifacts. Aster, with her ability, would sense if these artifacts were objects of the interesting kind, and we\u2019d buy them from the clueless merchants.\n\nThen we\u2019d turn right back around and sell them to shady rich people for a more than decent profit.\n\nIt was an easy game, save for the fact that self-proclaimed artifact bounty hunters were after us and the fact that handling cursed artifacts without proper precaution could just as easily wipe us (and bystanders.) off the map.\n\nA clean cut man with dirtied hair and ripped clothes raced up to me. \u201cHey boss,\u201d it was Matt, and with someone in tow, gripped tightly by the collar. \u201cThis guy says he knows you.\u201d\n\nI looked at the fiery redheaded man with odd, dark tinted glasses beside him. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d I looked at the man more carefully. \u201cNope, and Matt- release him.\u201d\n\nMatt did so and the guy fell to the floor. He picked himself up and extended a hand. \u201cMy name is Quincy Kieni,\u201d he pointed to the sphere Aster was holding, \u201cand uh, that sphere belongs to me.\u201d I looked at him in confusion. He scratched his chin. \u201cOkay, not really- but I was about to buy that.\u201d\n\nI shook my head. \u201cWell you can\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\nHe sighed and started to wave his hands rather eccentrically. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll pay you double!\u201d He began to rant now, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand how important that is. You tourists don\u2019t realize that-\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I cut him off. \u201cWhat\u2019s so good about this?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe me,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut it\u2019s an alien artifact. Debris from a crashed ship east of here. Now, I\u2019ll pay double-\u201d\n\nAster laughed at his words. \u201cYeah, we kinda already know that.\u201d He stopped and saw the gloves. \u201cWe\u2019re in the artifact underworld, you?\u201d\n\nHe nodded- then tried to seize the sphere. Matt caught him again. \u201cOkay, fine,\u201d he hissed. \u201cCan I at least propose a deal?\u201d\n\nThis was getting tedious. \u201cWhat deal?\u201d\n\nHe cleared his throat dramatically. \u201cFor the past week-\u201d he coughed, cutting himself off. Matt gave me a look, \u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors of a fallen meteorite east of here messing with phones, electronics, et cetera-et cetera.\u201d I wondered where his rumors came from. \u201cAlso according to some Company scanners I stole- anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d I snapped. \u201cYou stole Company scanners? Not cool!\u201d The Company were the people after us- those who stole artifacts for themselves in order to keep the world \u2018safe\u2019.\n\nAnd getting in their way mostly led to death. \u201cThat\u2019s not the important part,\u201d he mused. \u201cLook, I know they\u2019re doing recovery somewhere nearby-\u201d he pointed to the sphere. \u201cI can put together a spell or something and track down the rest of the ship.\u201d\n\nI saw what he wanted then. \u201cYou want to work together.\u201d\n\nHe nodded shyly. \u201cI\u2019ll locate the spaceship. We get in and out.\u201d He gestured to his little messenger bag. \u201cI got a list of spells in there. Invisibility, Bloomshape, Sanctified\u2026\u201d\n\nJoining forces with the strange little magician would definitely put more Company men on our trail. However, recovering more artifacts for ourselves could net me enough money from my contact at the DoD to essentially bribe our way out of any Company trouble.\n\nI sighed heavily. \u201cOkay, you got a deal.\u201d Matt released him, and for the second time he fell, splashing mud all over us.\n\nQuincy Kieni, as it turned out, was not good at magic at all. The first three attempts to cast a location spell on the artifact ended in a series of sparks, fires, and explosions, each time worse than the last.\n\n\u201cNot to worry,\u201d he seethed, \u201cseventh times the charm!\u201d At least he was right about that one.\n\nBlack smoky lines erupted from the sphere and pointed us east, cutting across hills and roads.\n\nSo we began the journey walking and splashing in the rain, the short fiery magician leading us forwards, whistling a tune to himself so annoyingly I considered cutting off the deal.\n\nMatt walked beside him, making sure he didn\u2019t pull any tricks. I and Aster walked behind, eyeing our surroundings for safety.\n\nAt a certain point Aster began to shiver. Not from the rain but- \u201cWe\u2019re getting close,\u201d she noted. \u201cIt\u2019s not all debris-\u201d she reached out into the ether and froze, \u201c-Company Men- and- something else.\u201d\n\nI asked her if she could tell what it was. She couldn\u2019t. The journey continued, and the boisterous Quincy started to the quiet, now muttering the tune underneath his breath.\n\nAnd over a hill and through the brush we saw it. A river, cutting through rocky hills in a small unassuming valley.\n\nAnd there it was, large and looming. A great metal disc, pulsing with energy and symbols that glowed against the rain. Smoke churned out as water reacted with the metal- just as the sphere had done.\n\nAll around the crashed ship were people. Explorers sent from the Company, bagging artifacts, taking photographs and even loading off large pieces of the ship itself into trucks coming and going.\n\nThey marched with urgency as the rushing waters eroded the ship, more and more parts of it being washed away.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Quincy murmured, \u201cthis is a larger operation than I thought they\u2019d send.\u201d\n\nI squinted. \u201cLook-\u201d I pointed to something like a chair being brought out. A dead body, short, gray, and clearly non-human lay dead on it, \u201ca gray.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s dead, large eyes, black as night looked eerily at us, sending a chill down my spine. \u201cThat\u2019ll fetch a price,\u201d Matt noted. This was true- corpses, though we never had the chance to recover one, sold at astronomically high prices, pun intended.\n\nQuincy seemed to disagree. \u201cBut think of the blood in that thing,\u201d he mused. \u201cSo many different applications to science. Cancer, the Flu, Covid\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a magician,\u201d Aster joked, \u201cyou seem to care a lot about science.\u201d\n\nI silenced them. \u201cAnd we better get in there before they take all of that loot away.\u201d I turned to our newfound magician. \u201cSo do your thing. Invisibility?\u201d\n\nHe reached into his bag and whipped out a phone, opening an app and observing a photograph of a spellbook. \u201cWell, see,\u201d he nervously began, \u201cI don\u2019t exactly know that one.\u201d I looked at him rather angrily. \u201cBut I can make them think we\u2019re one of them?\u201d\n\nI sighed. \u201cThat\u2019ll do.\u201d That in fact, as we would find out soon enough, wouldn\u2019t do.\n\nThe man read out the words and waved his hands eccentrically, and gold lines surrounded us like snakes, swirling around us. \u201cDone.\u201d And then he started to race down the rocky hill.\n\n\u201cMatt, keep an eye on him.\u201d He nodded and went after the magician.\n\nAster and I followed, entering the camp and nodding to the clueless agents. We went into a tent, found a couple of powerful devices and pocketed them into our bag- one enchanted to fit in an unknown number of items.\n\nWe made sure not to take anything that looked particularly dangerous. Or important enough.\n\n\u201cThe grey-\u201d I remembered, \u201cdo you think we can?\u201d\n\nWe observed the men transporting the body onto a truck. \u201cToo well guarded.\u201d\n\nA woman came up to us, a look of annoyance in her face. \u201cYou two!\u201d she snapped. \u201cStop idling about and get to work!\u201d\n\nThe spell held, though the lines seemed to waver. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I replied. \u201cWhere to?\u201d\n\nShe gestured. \u201cWe need more people inside the ship.\u201d\n\nI nodded and we headed off, the lines now starting to vibrate. This was not good. Her eyes were on us, and we quickly entered the alien ship before she saw through our deception.\n\nThe inside was definitely larger than the outside. It had seemed relatively small on the outside, enough to carry maybe a crew of four, or five.\n\nBut the inside was ginormous. It was a maze of halls crawling with Company Agents scanning and scraping samples of highly reactive metal.\n\nAster tugged at me, and we found a room deeper in. \u201cSomething\u2019s here,\u201d she whispered.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d a voice shouted. \u201cThat area hasn\u2019t been deconned.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll uh, handle it,\u201d I lied. The agent handed us a mask and we put it on, entering the room and closing the door behind us.\n\n\u201cWoah,\u201d Aster gasped, shining a flashlight onto the room. It was some sort of\u2026 morgue. Dead alien bodies, oddly humanoid and gray, now decaying sat on tables across the room, some cut up, some still preserved, pristine and glimmering in an unknown yellow liquid.\n\nI felt an odd sense of fear- and being watched by something hidden inside the room, watching with deep, bulbous black eyes.\n\nThe door opened behind us, and a woman with stark blue hair walked in. \u201cWoah is right,\u201d she agreed, spraying a bottle of something into the air. \u201cWhat designation are you from?\u201d She looked at us intently, and the spell started to drift. \u201cDo you even have clearance to be in this deep?\u201d\n\nI looked at Aster in confusion, then back at her. \u201cWe, uh, got sent here by the woman in charge.\u201d\n\nThe lines surrounding us started to vanish. \u201cI need to see ID Tags-\u201d she squinted as us- \u201cnow!\u201d That was the moment the spell broke. Her brow furrowed and- \u201cIntruder!\u201d she shouted, \u201cwe\u2019ve got artifact-\u201d\n\nAster reached out and scrambled her mind. She fell, dazed. I heard the rumblings of people approaching. \u201cDamn it!\u201d\n\nWe backed into the morgue, the dead almost staring at us, wondering what would happen next. I shoved a table onto the door, and the agents of the other side started to knock.\n\n\u201cWhat-\u201d the door started to open, \u201cnow-\u201d\n\nA uniformed man entered the room, saw us and started firing, bullets hitting the wall beneath us. They began to enter shooting as we hid behind a counter, firing back.\n\nThat was when the first man screamed.\n\nSomething leaped from the shadows slashing the man and pouncing off, leaving him bloodied and terrified. He fired around and screamed as it leaped back, falling to the floor, dead.\n\nI dared a peek- claw marks, stab wounds. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a live gray!\u201d a second agent yelled. Radio chatter. \u201cNon-lethals- the boss wants it alive!\u201d\n\nThis was good news for us. A tranq dart would at least keep us alive- though spending time in a prison was not so good. On the other hand, more agents were coming down the halls, ready to seize the alien.\n\nThat\u2019s when I had the plan. \u201cAster- this just might work, but-\u201d I told her the plan.\n\nShe nodded and began to reach into the ether. Across us, the agents fired at shadows in darkness- there were two of them, fighting back. Agents started to be lifted into the air, carried by an unknown psychic and tossed aimlessly.\n\nThen one of the Greys darted at us, and stopped. It bared claws and teeth sharp as knives and I grew scared for a moment.\n\nBut the plan had worked. Aster reached into its mind and- \u201cA deal!\u201d she whispered, harsh. She turned to me. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\n\nTemporarily, at least- they were on our side.\n\nThere were three, I realized, and we began to fight our way out. The agents started to retreat, overpowered by the surprise. The Greys led the way, and I headed out.\n\nThe hall ahead of us was clear, and in the midst of the confusion we quickly exited the craft. Outside was another mess though, and Quincy and Matt were shot and hid, spells cast, bullets deflected.\n\nA Grey snarled and leaped at them. \u201cMatt, Quincy!\u201d I shouted. \u201cLet\u2019s get outta here!\u201d\n\nWe were being surrounded. \u201cThe truck!\u201d Matt shouted back, starting to back towards a truck loaded with artifacts. \u201cI hotwired the truck!\u201d\n\nWe ran, avoiding all we could. A bullet just barely grazed me and I yelped as I reached the truck. The others followed suit, climbing inside and I started it up- and so did the three extraterrestrials.\n\n\u201cGo, go!\u201d Quincy shouted. \u201cShould\u2019ve-\u201d the window shattered and a bullet hole emerged in the leather behind me, \u201cmade a Plan B.\u201d\n\nI hit the gas and charged forwards, knocking a tent over and spilling it\u2019s contents. There was an explosion behind us, and suddenly, we were out of the hills and into fresh road.\n\nDistracted by whatever chaos we had sown, they didn\u2019t give chase. And it was smooth sailing from then; we headed into a little campground a little to the west, and stopped.\n\nWe got out, and cheered. The three aliens looked at oddly and seemed to nod, understanding. One had been shot and lay dying, leaking odd yellow from it. The two spoke words in a chittering sort of way to the third as it died.\n\nIt passed, breath leaving our world. The two stared at us with bulbous eyes and leaped into the trees, leaving us with the corpse of the third.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Quincy started, \u201cthat went rather well.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you insane?\u201d Matt snapped. \u201cWe almost died.\u201d\n\nI shook my head. \u201cBut we got some great loot here,\u201d reminding the two. \u201cAnd we got\u2026\u201d I stared at the corpse, \u201cthat. It\u2019ll pay off some of our debts and fetch a good profit for us all.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, his share?\u201d Aster inquired. \u201cThat spell was barely effective.\u201d\n\nThe magician seemed nervous at that. \u201cWell, I was actually thinking of another prize.\u201d Oh dear. What more was he going to ask for? \u201cYou all seem like experienced people,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWhat if I join you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d we all shouted. He ended up joining us anyway. We did need a magician, and a rather useless one was better than none at all.\n\nThe alien artifacts- especially the corpse fetched a high price on the market. We, soon, were overflowing in cash. Sure, we didn\u2019t know what our clients- much less the government was going to do with it.\n\nBut at the end of the day that didn\u2019t matter. Our job was done, and we lived to see another day. Such was life in the world of the artifact underground- it\u2019s really the small things that matter- the knowledge that you, at least, would live to see another day.\n\nAnd that, by me, was okay.\n\n\n[Vol 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13cci6c/i_sell_cursed_artifacts_for_a_living_theres_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

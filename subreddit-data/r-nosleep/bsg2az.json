    "postText": "[Part One](https://redd.it/brco33)\n[Part Two](https://redd.it/brsj8v)\n\n****\n\n\n\nShe hesitated a moment before breaking into a smile.  \u201cIs that what you call me?  I like it.  My name is actually Melanie though.\u201d\n\nI felt my face reddening.  Of course her name wasn\u2019t actually Rachel.  That was just something I made up in my head.  Still, my embarrassment couldn\u2019t keep up with my confusion and joy.  \u201cIs it really you?\u201d\n\nShe nodded.  \u201cYeah, it\u2019s me.\u201d\n\nRachel\u2026Melanie grunted as I stepped forward and started hugging her.  Laughing, she hugged me back for a moment, but then she whispered in my ear.  \u201cThomas, we need to talk, and not out here.  Can we go inside?\u201d\n\nI broke away and nodded, wiping at my eyes as I tried to finish unlocking the door with a shaking hand.  My heart was pounding and I still felt like I was in a strange and wonderful dream, but when we had gotten inside and sat down on my living room sofa, I forced myself to focus on the biggest question I had.\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\nMelanie had still been smiling as we sat down, but now she looked worried and sad.  \u201cThomas, that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to tell you.  Things aren\u2019t like you think they are.  They never have been.\u201d\n\nI frowned, a new line of fear cutting through my happy haze.  \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nShe held the bridge of her nose for a moment, looking down like she was trying to figure out how to say\u2026whatever it was she had to say.  \u201cThomas\u2026you\u2019re part of a psychological experiment.  I\u2019ve been a part of it for longer than you have as one of the actors, and I still don\u2019t know all the details.  I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s run by some government agency, and I know they\u2019re investing a lot of money and time into it, but for what reasons\u2026that I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d\n\nI realized I was wringing my hands.  No, that wasn\u2019t right.  It couldn\u2019t be right.  This was some kind of trick.\n\nMelanie went on.  \u201cWhat I do know is that you\u2019re being watched as a long-term subject.  They have constructed this whole scenario where you do a secret job watching someone\u2026me\u2026who looks like they might be trapped.  They give you instructions and a way of making choices.  You\u2019ve got buttons or something you can choose between, right?\u201d\n\nI nodded weakly, my tongue thick in my throat.  \u201cYeah.  A red one.   And a green one.\u201d\n\nShe sighed and nodded.  \u201cI think they\u2019re testing how much you\u2019ll obey.  What choices you\u2019ll make based off of your morals, your intelligence, and your fear.  It\u2019s interesting, or at least I thought so when I first joined up six years ago.  They\u2019ve never officially given me many details, just the overall gist.  But people talk.  The other actors and me, sometimes we hear things, and we gossip.\u201d  She smiled sadly.  \u201cThat\u2019s what caused me to start feeling bad.\u201d\n\nI interrupted.  \u201cOther actors?\u201d\n\nMelanie\u2019s eyes widened.  \u201cOh shit, yeah.  Sorry.  I think they still call him Mr. Solomon?  And there are others too.\u201d  When I just stared at her, she went on.  \u201cAnyway, for a long time it was just the normal job, right?  I spend six hours a day acting like I\u2019m this trapped girl, mainly faking painting or watching t.v.  You know, boring stuff\u2026\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but interrupt again, hating the hurt trembling in my voice.  \u201cYou fake the painting?  You aren\u2019t really painting those wonderful pictures?\u201d\n\nNow Melanie looked embarassed.  \u201cNo, sorry.  I can\u2019t paint a bit.  I\u2019m a pretty good singer though.\u201d  She tried to smile, but faltered.  Reaching forward, she touched my arm.  \u201cThat\u2019s why they always have the paintings turned where you can\u2019t see them.  They\u2019re already done beforehand.  All you ever see is some blank canvases and\u2026well, when they *want* me to show you something.\u201d  Her expression darkened as she went on.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I had to break the rules and contact you.  When they started doing this hidden message, mind game bullshit, I got worried.  Worried you would take it too serious.  That you could get hurt, or even hurt yourself.  As soon as you left your shift tonight, I talked to one of the guys in the video department.  He told me about how you had reacted.  Showed me how you were still parked down the street from the building.  I drove over\u2014the bedroom set is in a building outside of town.  I saw you sitting in your car, and I almost approached you then, but I was scared of getting caught and fired.  So I parked and waited until I could follow you somewhere else and let you know I was okay.\u201d\n\nShe blinked back tears.  \u201cI\u2019m ashamed to say I almost left a couple of times.  I don\u2019t want to lose this job, and I tried to tell myself you would be okay after a day or two.  I could get them to change the script enough that you felt like I was okay and wouldn\u2019t worry too much.\u201d\n\nI felt an angry heat growing in my chest.  \u201cWell, that\u2019s nice of you.\u201d\n\nShe looked up, her eyes red.  \u201cI know.  I\u2019m a shit.  I\u2019m so sorry.  I was being selfish and cowardly, but I didn\u2019t actually leave.  And then when I saw Charlie leaving the building, saw you running over to talk to him, I knew they were escalating it even further.\u201d\n\n\u201cCharlie?\u201d\n\nMelanie rolled her eyes in frustration.  \u201cShit, yeah.  Sorry.  Charlie Jefferies.  He\u2019s another actor.  In an earlier version of the experiment he actually played Mr. Solomon, but they decided he wasn\u2019t scary enough, so now he\u2019s usually in one of the suits.  He\u2019s actually done that for your version a lot, you just can\u2019t recognize him under all that get-up they wear.\u201d\n\nI kept curling and uncurling my hands on my lap.  It was all too much.  I felt like a pinball going between anger and relief and embarassment and confusion.  \u201cSo all that stuff he told me?  That was all just to scare me?  See how I\u2019d react?\u201d\n\nShe nodded as she sniffled and wiped her nose with the back of her hand.  \u201cYes.  I\u2019m sorry.  That\u2019s why I knew I couldn\u2019t wait any longer to tell you.  I could see how worried and scared you were going back to your car.\u201d\n\nI pulled my arm back from her touch.  \u201cWell, thanks I guess.  At least you stopped me before I went to the police and looked like a joke in front of them too.\u201d  I just wanted her gone, her sympathetic, pitying eyes off of me.  \u201cThanks for stopping by and letting me in on it.\u201d  I tried to make my voice sound hard and unfeeling, but it came out watery instead.  Standing up, I turned away from her so she couldn\u2019t see as I started to cry.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2026uh\u2026I need time to think about everything.  It\u2019s\u2026a lot.\u201d\n\nA moment passed and then her hand was on my shoulder.  \u201cThomas, you don\u2019t have anything to be embarrassed about.  They are very good at what they do.  All you did was what you thought was right.  Because you\u2019re a good man.\u201d  I shrugged.\n\n\u201cI thought that you were in trouble and I wanted to help.\u201d\n\nShe gently turned me toward her, and when I looked up, she smiled and sniffed again.  \u201cI know, but you need to realize, most people wouldn\u2019t have tried to help.  Not when it meant giving up their job or risking themselves like that.  Not for a stranger.\u201d\n\nI wiped at my face as I looked away.  \u201cWell, I still feel dumb, but I\u2019m glad it\u2019s not real.  I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay.  That we both are.\u201d  I paused and caught her eye again.  \u201cWe are, aren\u2019t we?  Safe, I mean.\u201d\n\nShe hesitated before nodding.  \u201cYeah, I think so.  Like I said, they have a lot invested in whatever this is, and the fact that they\u2019re willing to go as far as they have with you makes me wonder, but I\u2019ve never seen any signs of anyone getting hurt.  I think the worst that could happen is one or both of us gets fired.\u201d\n\nI felt my face getting red again.  \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that.  I\u2019m going to quit tomorrow.  I\u2019ll finally get to hit their damn buttons.  Maybe both of them.\u201d  I started to smile, but then I saw the look on Melanie\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cThomas, please don\u2019t do that.  I don\u2019t think they would hurt us, but if you up and quit, they\u2019ll figure out I\u2019ve talked to you.  I don\u2019t think they watch us all the time, but I don\u2019t know what they can find out.  You know, tracking cellphones, spy satellites, whatever.  I\u2019m taking a big risk just being here, and I don\u2019t want them catching on.\u201d\n\nI took a step back from her.  \u201cSo you want to keep getting paid to trick people like me.\u201d\n\nShe reached out and grabbed my right hand.  I had been clenching it unconsciously, and it relaxed at her touch.  \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to.  But I wasn\u2019t expecting this.  How the experiment has changed, getting to actually meet you\u2026I can\u2019t do it long-term, but another month or two to save up money?  Now that you\u2019re in on it and won\u2019t be scared or hurt by it any more?\u201d  She smiled.  \u201cThat I can do.  That we can *both* do.  We can keep going like normal, take some more of their money, and then one of us can quit.  The next month, the other one can.  How does that sound?\u201d\n\nI shrugged uncertainly.  It made some sense, and once I had calmed down, it would probably make more.  She gave my hand a squeeze.\n\n\u201cAnd when this is all over, I want to get to know you better.  I know I\u2019ve been playing a role, but for the most part, that\u2019s been me you\u2019ve been watching all this time.  I think it\u2019s only fair I get to see more of you too.\u201d  She blushed.  \u201cAssuming you\u2019re interested in that.\u201d\n\nI felt my hand growing clammy in hers as my stomach fluttered.  \u201cWell, I mean\u2026yeah.  Yeah, I would really like that.\u201d  Swallowing, I added, \u201cHow long do we have to wait to see each other again?\u201d\n\nMelanie grinned at me.  \u201cWork another month or so.  Save what you can.  And then quit.  I\u2019ll wait another two or three weeks, and then I\u2019ll do the same.  And then\u2026\u201d  She looked up at the ceiling as she pondered it for a moment, and I was struck again by how beautiful she was, even if she was a little different in person than I had imagined.  \u201d\u2026three months from tonight we\u2019ll meet right here.  I\u2019ll come over and we can start getting to know each other better.  How\u2019s that sound?\u201d\n\nReturning her smile, I nodded.  \u201cThat sounds great.\u201d  \n\n****\n\nWhen she left a couple of minutes later, part of me hated to see her go, but another part was relieved.  I was so exhausted, and while I was so happy she was okay and we had finally met, I felt like the burned up wire in an old lightbulb.  I needed time alone.  Time to think and calm down, and most of all, time to rest.\n\nI didn\u2019t really even remember falling asleep, and when I woke up, I realized my alarm had been buzzing for over thirty minutes.  I jumped up and raced to get to my shift at work.  As she had been leaving, Melanie had stressed again how we needed to act completely the same.  That meant not freaking out, but it also meant not acting like everything was okay either.  If I suddenly showed no signs of being worried about her, that would tip them off too.  I promised and she left after a brief hug and kiss.  Remembering that now, through the haze of my tiredness the night before, it felt like a dream.\n\nStill, I went into the surveillance room with a much lighter heart.  I didn\u2019t have to worry or feel guilty any more about not helping her, and there was some satisfaction in finally pulling one over on the people that had tricked me for so long.  Besides, in three months I would be done with this place and get to see Ra\u2026Melanie again.  In person, at least.\n\nBecause I got to watch her on the video feed as soon as I came into work.  She was asleep when I first got there, and I found myself wondering if she was as tired as I still felt.  When she woke up later and started reading a book, I found myself beginning to smile and had to stop myself.  I should still be worried acting, not smiling like I had a crush.  I had to do better so Melanie didn\u2019t get in trouble.\n\nAn hour or so later she started working on another of \u201cher\u201d paintings.  Watching her work, I was amazed at how real it all looked.  It was hard to see everything from my angle, but I would have sworn she had paint on those brushes and was really painting whatever was on the canvas.  I found myself feeling proud of her.  She really was a great actress.  Not only didn\u2019t I see her giving any clues that we had met or talked, but she really did seem different in the room than she had in my apartment.  I supposed that was what she had meant by \u201cplaying a role\u201d. \n\nI was almost at the end of my shift, and while I hated to leave her, I had to admit that I was ready for some more sleep.  Trying to guard my reactions all day had been exhausting, and I was dreading the next few weeks.  But then I realized she was done painting.  I expected her to just go and do something else, but instead she picked up the canvas at its edges and carefully walked it over to the sofa.  Her body was blocking it at first, but then she stepped aside.\n\nIt was a painting of a massive tree.  The bark was a dark red, with a huge twisting trunk that broke off into a dozen branches.  Those branches were covered in leaves that were so deep green they almost reminded me of storm clouds more than the top of a tree.  Like all the paintings, I felt touched by it, even now that Melanie had told me she didn\u2019t paint them.  The images themselves, combined with the colors and the small details\u2026they really were amazing.  \n\nJust like this one.  If you looked close enough, you could see that there were several small blackbirds in the branches of the tree.  It was funny, but they almost looked like they were\u2026\n\nIt almost looked like they were made out of words.\n\nI felt my heart start to hammer and I forced myself to stay calm.  No point in being silly.  I knew it was all a game now, and I just had to play my part a little while longer.  Still, the worried me would want to know what the words said, so I might as well try to read them.  I squinted, following the birds right to left and top to bottom.\n\n**That**\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**girl**\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**isn\u2019t**\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**me**\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nI looked away from the painting to see Rachel staring up at me.  She looked terrified.\n\n[*Oh no.*](https://redd.it/9ndww5)\n\n****\n\n[Part Four](https://redd.it/btkvkl)",

Anyone really painting those pictures is likely to have paint under their nails. I don't know what type of paint it's being used, but I'm guessing acrylic because it dries much faster than oils do, and when you described how the canvas were put onto the couch, you couldn't put one canvas against another (like, one leaning onto another, even at the edges) if it were oil paint, because it would smudge the other piece. You mentioned how realistic it looks when she's painting, and painting is often at least a little bit messy, whether from cleaning brushes, or paint splatter, what have you. But if you can, think back to \"Melanie's\" hands. She touched you often, so maybe you can recall that. Also, look very closely at the hands of the girl in the room. The whole reason for this long-ass post is that it may be able to help you differentiate betwixt the two girls, or help you identify one from the other. \n\nPlease be careful!",

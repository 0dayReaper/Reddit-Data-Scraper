Every scrape, and foot step full of grim possibility. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know if it was a dream or a vision, but the  grotesque beauty of that half wooden thing is burned into my mind\u2019s eye. I fear for my sanity, my autonomy, and my safety. \r\n\r\nAs I stare at the grim industrial cement of the walls, a little voice whispers to me from the back of my mind. This voice has nothing to do with living plant matter, or mysterious old burn outs. No, this evil, insidious fucking voice I\u2019ve known long before my life started defying reason. \r\n\r\nI hate myself, but for the first time, in a long time, I want, no, I fucking need a hit of something terrible. \r\n\r\nI check my phone, our jailers didn\u2019t seem too thorough in their search, seeing as we are kilometers deep into a space distorted wood mill from hell, they probably didn\u2019t feel much need to. \r\n\r\nIt's 7:00 am, and Mike rises, using the chemical toilet with a convict\u2019s lack of shame. \r\n\r\n\u201cYou know something I don\u2019t? \u201c I say, miserably. \r\n\r\nMike stretches, and sits on the bed leaning back against the grimy wall.\r\n\r\n\u201cProbably, but I want to change that. \r\n\r\nSome point soon, they\u2019re going to take one of us,  and start removing  pieces  to see if they can get a reaction out of Jim and the boys. \u201c Mike starts fiddling with the cuff of his suit jacket as he talks. \r\n\r\n\u201cDid you hear them talking or something? \u201c I say, confused, knowing the man had been out cold. \r\n\r\n\u201cNo. \r\n\r\nKidnappings, are cookie cutter things. They go one of a handful of ways, trust me. \r\n\r\nNeither of us are kids, and we know the Copy Clan are doing this for a reason. So we can take most of the options off the table. \r\n\r\nThey haven\u2019t killed one of us, so logic dictates they intend to either let us go, or tear us up a bit. \u201c As Mike finishes he tears a two inch or so hole in the cuff of his jacket. \r\n\r\n\u201cBut We\u2019ve still got about four hours to go. \u201c I say, continuing Mike\u2019s thought. \r\n\r\n\u201cVery good, Kev. \r\n\r\nThese guys are on edge, and judging by the human sacrifice, and ritual bullshit, I don\u2019t think they are versed in the art of torture so much as the love of it.  We won\u2019t last an hour, let alone four. \u201c  Mike is serious, but still possessed of that mercenary calm of his. \r\n\r\nThe only thing that\u2019d get me feeling like that at the moment comes from low rent apartments and low character people. \r\n\r\nMike shakes his sleeve and out falls a dozen or so pistol rounds. They look old, and tarnished. \r\n\r\nHe pulls out what at first, I think is a cell phone, but immediately I notice it\u2019s a bit too thick. My suspicions are confirmed as Mike twists and reassembles it into a small, but dangerous looking pistol. He loads and tucks it in an inside pocket of his jacket. \r\n\r\n\u201cBut you think you have these guys figured out? \u201c I say, challenging Mike\u2019s bravado. \r\n\r\nHe looks at me for a minute, silent, I begin to feel nervous. \r\n\r\n\u201cI did, until you said that. \r\n\r\nWhat do you know Kev? \u201c Mike\u2019s question is bordering on threat, the look he gives me brings back memories of missing teeth. \r\n\r\nMy gut instinct is to lie, I know there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to convince this maniac that there is something here worth saving. \r\n\r\nI shake my head, I feel a small smirk start to form. \r\n\r\n\u201cSomething was in my head. \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s something else here, it tried to convince me that it was some kind of victim, that I needed to help it. \u201c My words don\u2019t dispel my fear, but I as I speak them I start to get a grip on the situation. \r\n\r\n\u201cBut you felt it didn\u2019t you? You caught a whiff of paranormal bullshit. \r\n\r\nWonder why I wanted you along? I was useless as hell when I got here, the Path and the Mountain? They were a crash course in what this corner of reality is all about. And there\u2019s only one other person I know of who\u2019s passed. \u201c Mike grins, the man can wash off the makeup, and wear a discount rack suit, but that fang like smile is the same as always. \r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think they\u2019re taking you, do you? \u201c The chuckle at the end of my sentence is mirthless, the soundtrack to grim acceptance. \r\n\r\n\u201cNo, and in order for me to be able to do my thing, you are going to have to think on your feet. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know what you should be expecting, but you need to drag it out. \u201c  Mike is searching his jacket, and finds a small lump, he moves it to the tear in his cuff and produces a book of matches. \r\n\r\nAs he takes the worn, faded pack out of the jacket, I feel a sense of foreboding. Like most important things in my life, something is clearly off about these matches. \r\n\r\nMike puts them back in a suit pocket and that sense of dread subsides. \r\n\r\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s it, pack of spooky matches, sneaky pistol, and banking on me? \r\n\r\nGotta say Mike, my faith in these Watcher assholes is pretty low. First we get caught, and it doesn\u2019t exactly seem like Plan B had too much effort put into it. \u201c I Bitch for the sake of it, knowing we have to play the hand we\u2019re dealt. \r\n\r\nBut something, it doesn\u2019t seem quite right. Like there is a piece of the plan neither Mike nor myself are privy to. \r\n\r\n\u201cYeah, something isn\u2019t  clicking into place here. But we can cross that bridge when we come to it. We can\u2019t miss the forest for the trees here. \r\n\r\nFor now, we both have a job to do. \u201c Mike knows, or thinks he knows more than he\u2019s saying. I\u2019m honestly thankful he isn\u2019t choosing to share, I\u2019ve had just about as much shitty news as I can take at the moment. \r\n\r\nAround an hour later the door to the cell is opened by a pair of men. \r\n\r\nLarger than the rest, at first glance, they don\u2019t seem as deformed and twisted as many of their counterparts deep within the mill. \r\n\r\nThey wear loose overalls, hung with nasty looking tools that look like they would be just as efficient at shaping flesh as wood. \r\n\r\nMuffled is the best way I can describe their movements, like the outside of their bodies are simply layers and layers of dead tissue, being moved from deep within. \r\n\r\nAs I see Their sunken eyes, and teeth set in deep recessed mouths, I realize how inhuman these particular  golems are. \r\n\r\nOne points to me, and with one stiff, browning, leather like finger beckons me forward. \r\n\r\nI feel like I\u2019m being marched toward an electric chair. Every cell in my body screaming at me to fight or run, but that yoke of civilization pushing me forward, dignity trumping survival instinct. \r\n\r\nOnce upon a time I would have closed my eyes, or looked away from the horrors unfolding around me. But I force myself to watch the dark work , to try and understand, to try and sift some clue or meaning behind the ritual. \r\n\r\nThe victims are in various states of life, from screaming and mutilated beyond belief, to pristine and shackled, waiting their first attentions from Spaceshapers. \r\n\r\nIf this is what they do in the open, I shudder to think what they have in store for me in whatever dark corner of this place they are taking me. \r\n\r\nI wish I could help, I wish I could do something to stop the casual, almost, mechanical violence around me. \r\n\r\nBut I promise myself that I won\u2019t let this be in vain. I won\u2019t let the people around me be  treated like building materials and cheap cuts of meat for nothing. \r\n\r\nI notice the repetition, each of the flesh puppets moving almost as if on tracks, taking exact amounts of steps, moving their limbs to exact degrees. From time to time, something stops this, some break in the rhythm, some stumble or misstep, and it causes short lived brutal fights.  \r\n\r\nTheir chanting isn\u2019t gibberish,  the overlapping chatter is hard to sort with the din of the machines and the scrape of handtools, but I pick up bits and pieces. They talk of making space, of crafting bulwarks against time, space, and Gods. \r\n\r\nI try to burn every horrific sight into my mind. To get any edge I can. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m taken into a room, wide and empty, the back wall is deep in shadows, and in the center is an old tall workbench. The top is covered in decades of glue, stain and blood. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m cuffed through a steel eye bolt in the table. I chuckle to myself, wondering how many other people have been handcuffed on two separate occasions without police involvement. \r\n\r\nThe air is dry, sawdust sits in layers on the floor and stuck to the walls. There is a  rotten, spoiled sap like reek. \r\n\r\nThe shadowy room is full of dark Promises and evil potential. I can\u2019t control the racing of my heart, but I try and stay coherent. \r\n\r\nThere are a few stools in the room, waist high. Ceiling is a mess of support struts and rusted lighting. Cuffs are new, but the eye bolt\u2026 \r\n\r\n\u201cWell how the fuck\u2019s it going Kev? \u201c Ed says from behind me, I hear his footsteps, but also something else, a dull, meaty thump. \r\n\r\n\u201cBeen better. \u201c I say, trying to channel a little bit of Mike, Ed laughs, I assume I failed. \r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that Kevin, all of this is just a big business deal really. You are taking things too personal. \u201c I hear Ed take a wide path, keeping himself out of my line of sight for as long as possible. His work boots making muffled thuds on the cement floor, that other noise, getting more frequent and aggressive. \r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been told the same thing by shit like yourself for a couple of years now. \r\n\r\nNot getting any more comforting. \u201c I\u2019m doing my best to keep the conversation going, I don\u2019t know how long Mike needs, but once Ed starts in on me, I don\u2019t think I  have, long. \r\n\r\n\u201cShit like myself? \r\n\r\nOh you think I\u2019m\u2026 no Kev, all I am is white, getting on in years and Christian. I\u2019m not a void touched, thanks for the ego stroke though. \u201c  Ed finally steps in front of me, and I see the source of the noise. \r\n\r\nIt's old and red oak handled. It has a bright steel head, with a claw end, cleaned to a surgical shine.  I can\u2019t take my eyes off of the hammer. \r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I married in Kev. And me and the old lady have been keeping folks happy for a long time. \r\n\r\nWasn\u2019t easy finding her old man, even harder finding what he wanted for his daughter\u2019s hand. But I did it, wound up a little farther away from the light of God, but a lot closer to things with more\u2026 earthly power. \r\n\r\nAnd hey, the G-man has to forgive me, doesn\u2019t he? \u201c Ed laughs like a lunatic, ending his insane chortle by slamming the hammer into the layered surface of the table. \r\n\r\nThe sound is dull, but it sends shards of ancient glue, varnish and blood into my face. \r\n\r\n\u201cSo what does that have to do with us? \u201c I say, a drop of sweat and blood falls into my eye, I try to blink it away, but my vision stays red and blurry in one eye. \r\n\r\n\u201cEver heard of a Wood Spirit? Dryad, nymph, things like that? \u201d Ed says, I assume the question is rhetorical, a quick tap with the hammer makes my vision swim and tells me my assumption was wrong. \r\n\r\n\u201cI get the gist. \u201c I say, forcing myself to make eye contact with the man. \r\n\r\nThose eyes are yellowed, bloodshot, and on the verge of horrible things. \r\n\r\n\u201cWell, the Old Lady, she\u2019s within spitting distance of all that Dungeons and Dragons, hippie pagan bullshit. \r\n\r\nOnly, she\u2019s more like, fatwood, you know what fatwood is Kev? \r\n\r\nWhen a tree gets sick and parts of it start to die, sometimes the resin and nutrients get pulled to the living parts of the tree. As it rots, it creates fatwood. Real useful stuff, can start a fire soaking wet, burns for hours, but it\u2019s the death knell of the tree. \r\n\r\nThe old lady is why I can keep making little pocket dimensions for people like your buddy Art, she\u2019s the reason why I\u2019ve been alive since the states were young.  \r\n\r\nShe pulls those nutrients from the other branches of her family tree, but those branches are getting harder and harder to find. \r\n\r\nYour bosses, they want to try and buy me off with some trinkets and  cash. They don\u2019t want to get their hands really dirty, dragging  forest spirits,  wood nymphs and whatever the hell else back here for Ma to process. \r\n\r\nSo, I\u2019m going to give them a little choice, their folks, or Ma\u2019s family. \u201c His voice gets calm and quiet as he talks, as he finishes he brings the hammer down on my in tact hand. Not hard enough to break anything, but the pain makes me cling to wakefulness and fight back a wave of nausea. \r\n\r\nEd opens a drawer in the workbench, and draws out a 90\u2019s era camera. The red recording light turns on, and it\u2019s analogue internals grind to life. \r\n\r\nMy mind scrambles to find some purchase, to do something besides focus on the blinding pain, and mounting horror. \r\n\r\n\u201cWhat was with the dream? If you were just planning on torturing me, why the head games last night? \u201c my intent is to keep him in monologue mode, but a cloud flashes over Ed\u2019s face. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe fuck are you talking about? \u201c he says, sauntering his way toward me. \r\n\r\nHe begins to tap the hammer lightly against my skull, as if picking a spot to strike. \r\n\r\n\u201cI thought I was talking about you screwing with my head. \u201c I say, giving away as little as possible. \r\n\r\nEd cocks the hammer backward in a flash, my heart stops, but I force myself to talk, \u201c I wouldn\u2019t do that, if my eggs get all scrambled, you never get to find out if I am full of shit or not. \u201c, my voice is shaking, but my point is solid. \r\n\r\nEd puts on a grin that is made for being a last sight. \r\n\r\n\u201cYou think I keep that Bitch on a long enough leash to cause me trouble? \u201c the Spaceshaper says, kneeling, he digs the claw end of the hammer into my kneecap. \r\n\r\nThe shadows behind ed seem to shift slightly, the small, rustling noises from within getting more frequent. \r\n\r\n\u201cI think if this didn\u2019t matter I\u2019d be at minute ten of a snuff film by now. \u201c, Ed digs the claw deeper as I speak, daring me to push my luck, \u201c I\u2019m not trying to pull some power move, I think I\u2019m sitting on some information that can buy me, another couple of hours of you haggling with James before you resort to\u2026 this. \r\n\r\nYou agree? Or am I going to be walking in strange circles the rest of my life. \u201c\r\n\r\nEd\u2019s face lights up at the morbid dad-joke and he laughs, almost warmly, clapping his hand on my shoulder. Its calloused and has a grip like iron. \r\n\r\n\u201c I\u2019ll give you an hour, that\u2019s if you have anything to tell. \u201c Ed drives the claw end of the hammer into the table, burying it like an axe. \r\n\r\nI have his attention, but I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep it.  \r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, before this I\u2019ve never been much of a writer. Hell even now, let\u2019s face it, I\u2019m, okay at best. But I\u2019ve always been a top notch liar. \r\n\r\nI swing for the fences. \r\n\r\nI take every shred of knowledge I\u2019ve picked up, and put my own spin on it. If this was Art standing in front of me, whatever the fuck he is, I probably couldn\u2019t have gotten away with the fabrication. \r\n\r\nBut this guy, this paranormal tourist, how much does he really know?\r\n\r\nI talk without saying much, but I pepper in enough of the truth to keep him interested. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve never been so nervous in a conversation. It was the verbal equivalent of a Parkour routine, every sentence has to be interesting, but every twist of the truth is more dangerous than the last. \r\n\r\nAfter about twenty minutes I\u2019ve spun a story of being some kind of cryptozoologist, found the path chasing Junior, and know all about  \u201cThe Old Lady\u201d and her family. \r\n\r\nHe's buying a lot of it, but not the whole package. The guy is greedy, wanting to squeeze a little bit extra blood out of the rock that is me, but he knows how desperate I am too. \r\n\r\nHe paces, facing away from me, the mumbling he\u2019s doing is for my benefit, the words I can pick out are low and menacing. \r\n\r\nFun fact about the year I spent between escaping the mountain and now, there was a decent amount of reconstructive surgery on my hand. Believe it or not, bronze age caliber battlefield amputations do not tend to heal very well. \r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m saying is, I\u2019m missing a couple of bones next to my thumb. And as the smell of smoke starts to creep into the festering warehouse like room, I hope that\u2019s enough to get out of one of the cuffs. \r\n\r\nEd notices the smell too, and turns his attention toward the industrial door closing us in. He walks over, as the dull hum of old overhead speakers kicks on. \r\n\r\nI put my bodyweight on my thumb, muscles strain, tear and fold, the cuffs clatter slightly, but between the white noise of the speakers and the smoke, Ed doesn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nThere is a mechanical sounding screech of feedback that I\u2019m sure is purposeful, I know who is going to speak, long before I hear his voice. It\u2019s a perfect impression of a 60\u2019s radio announcer. \r\n\r\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain Mike, I just appreciate him. \r\n\r\n\u201cHey cool cats and hep kids, this is Jimmy Bonamo spinning the hits and cutting more than records on W-FUKT. \r\n\r\nToday\u2019s weather is combustible with a chance of random violence. \u201c \r\n\r\nEd is enraged, heaving on the sliding industrial door, something is blocking it\u2019s progress. \r\n\r\nThe surgically fused bones in my hand protest, but just as they feel like they are going to shatter, the cuff slides off of my hand. \r\n\r\nWhen Mike speaks again, it\u2019s not the man I talked with in my kitchen, but that clown garbled killer from the path. \r\n\r\n\u201cBut in all seriousness Ed, these flesh robots of yours, they don\u2019t pass the Turing test. \u201c There is a wet, meaty noise over the speakers, \u201c And this wood of your\u2019s , takes a bit to get going, but with the right firestarter\u2026. \u201c\r\n\r\nThere is an small explosion from within the woodshop, I use the rising din to cover the noise of tearing the hammer free. \r\n\r\nMike cackles over the speakers, I can see bright yellow flame through the crack in the door. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m feet behind Ed now, hammer ready to bury itself in the back of the man\u2019s skull. \r\n\r\nI know the chaos outside isn\u2019t as bad as it seems, that despite the way it sounds Mike is likely in just as desperate of a situation as I am. But Ed doesn\u2019t know this. \r\n\r\nNo, to Ed, and the half brained things manning the woodmill, this must seem like retribution, Devine or infernal. \r\n\r\nInstinct makes me put a hand on Ed\u2019s shoulder before I strike. Not a good instinct, or a useful one, but years of television have trained me. \r\n\r\nHe spins as I swing the hammer, the steel head slamming into his shoulder. \r\n\r\nAt first I\u2019m wary, thinking this man has some last trick up his sleeve. Some hidden weapon or, third arm, or whatever random bullshit the universe wants to throw at me. \r\n\r\nBut as we grapple and struggle for the hammer, the only weapon in this rapidly smoke filling room, I realize, we are both just people. \r\n\r\nAfter all of the things I\u2019ve been through, all of the literal monsters, my story might end at the hands of a man that has been middle aged for a hundred years. \r\n\r\nNeither of us are fighters, but we both know the stakes. From the outside the gradeschool level of fighting skill may have seemed funny under different circumstances. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019re rolling through discarded nails and debris, our blood adding to the ageless collection already soaked into cement and sawdust. \r\n\r\nMy elbow hits the workbench, my good hand goes numb, the hammer is wrenched from my grip, and I throw myself to the ground. \r\n\r\nEd buries the tool into the wood of the desk, where my head was a quarter second before. \r\n\r\nI get to my feet, dodging another swing of the hammer, it comes close enough to tear a gash in my cheek. \r\n\r\nEd is on the attack, his feet are stable, and the look in his eyes tells me he is looking for someone to take his frustrations out on. \r\n\r\nIf Ed was a technology loving man, I\u2019d have hit him with a cell phone. He\u2019d have buried the hammer in my skull, and had no problem torturing me to death. \r\n\r\nBut either being a luddite, or trying to keep with some kind of analogue horror aesthetic, what I grabbed from the table, was that massive, nearly suitcase sized 90\u2019s camera. \r\n\r\nIt breaks, but not before snapping his head back like a car wreck, and shattering his nose and teeth. \r\n\r\nThe hammer sitters into the depths of the room, but I\u2019ve grabbed one of the stools, it\u2019s awkward, but Ed is dazed, struggling to get to his feet. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know if you can kill someone with a stool, but I intend to find out. \r\n\r\n\u201cMa! \u201c Ed screams, blood from his broken face spraying the ground. \r\n\r\nThe organic, breaking, tearing noise shakes the room, pieces of the structure give way in an instant, the sliding door falling off it\u2019s tracks. \r\n\r\nThe mill proper has a half dozen open fires, the mimic like creatures try their best to douse the grey tinged flames, but nothing seems to properly put them out. \r\n\r\nBehind me, is a creature that is a mockery of the unearthly beauty from my dream. It tears trailing roots from the walls and ceiling around it, causing power surges and outages through the Mill. \r\n\r\nIt's nearly fifteen feet tall, a giant, and it\u2019s twisted, almost human face looks at me with rage and betrayal. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve made it out the door before the stool stops rolling. The thing behind me isn\u2019t some limping abomination I could bludgeon or outwit. \r\n\r\nThe mill is a vision of hell, cursed sawdust turns to screaming embers, torture victims scramble for freedom, hobbled or simply to tired and mutilated to run. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t bother looking for Mike, I see the most human of Ed\u2019s children armed with Wal mart rifles or handguns, taking wild shots where they think he might be. \r\n\r\nHe's either dead, or on his way to me. Either way, I run. \r\n\r\nIn the chaos, I\u2019m just another body, anything with a brain is trying to stop anything without one from burning to death, or destroying the creatures around it with a violent tantrum. \r\n\r\nThe screeching, rage filled plant thing behind me is slowed, but I push myself faster, desperate to get out of this hell hole. Any sense of confidence or power I had was dashed once fifteen feet of nightmare tore itself from the wall. \r\n\r\nMike\u2019s waiting at the lobby doors, purposely looking casual, but  matches my stride, we sprint through the blacktop parking lot. Twenty or so of Ed\u2019s children closing in, and the forest thing gaining more speed than seems possible now that it is out in the open. \r\n\r\nGunfire begins to close in around us, a lucky round puts a deep gouge in Mike\u2019s arm. Almost instinctively he draws the pistol,  turns, and fires a round into the crowd. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t understand why Mike would waste his time, with the novelty looking thing, until the round makes contact. \r\n\r\nSix of the human shaped things turn into piles of gore and wood pieces. My faith in the watchers increases marginally. \r\n\r\nMy faith in Mike drops, as he turns for a second shot and the recoil takes the awkwardly shaped pistol from his hand. Another four of Ed\u2019s children down, but they are within twenty feet and closing fast. \r\n\r\nThe end of the forest lined roadway is in sight, at the very last, I can\u2019t see them taking their army of horrors in the middle of the highway. \r\n\r\nBut fear and determination can only take a person so far. Mike starts to outpace me, and it dawns on me that I\u2019m not going to make the exit before being swarmed. \r\n\r\nMike turns to the left the second he leaves the forest, I don\u2019t blame him, but it doesn\u2019t exactly give me comfort. \r\n\r\nThe forest creature blocks out the last of the light from behind me and I feel a six fingered hand grab me by the wrist. \r\n\r\nFour police officers step onto the path in unison, their eyes are white and shifting, like thick smoke, not that it hampers their aim any. \r\n\r\nWhatever is behind me sprays me with gore, and it\u2019s grip goes slack. \r\n\r\nI break through the cordon, as armed creatures behind me take cover and begin focusing on the actual danger. \r\n\r\nThe half wood thing seems to dissolve into the forest, despite it\u2019s size. \r\n\r\nAlbert stands slightly off to the side of the police, covered from the gunfire and the horror by the foliage. \r\n\r\nHe smokes a cigar sized joint, and with every exhale the smoke cloud wafts to the officers in defiance of the building wind. \r\n\r\nMike is talking to James, who stands casually taking cover behind a car door. I join them half way through a conversation. \r\n\r\nMike is exhausted, and hurt, leaning against the police car. \r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s time we ask our friend for some help. \u201c James says, his tone seems to be chastising Mike, \u201c Do you agree? \u201c\r\n\r\n\u201cJust open the fucking doors old man. \u201cMike says pointing toward the horse trailer we had been towing behind the minibus. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs if in response, the doors spring open, a padlock shatters, and a twisted, feline head, easily the size of an engine block cranes out at an impossible angle. \r\n\r\n\u201cHello Kev. \u201c The creature says, as it pulls it\u2019s massive, lopsided form from the trailer. \r\n\r\nI know it\u2019s junior, but my fucking lord. \r\n\r\nHe could step on a tiger, hundreds upon hundreds of pounds of Path born flesh, no two limbs the same length, with teeth following suit.  But somehow, Junior moved with an insectile grace. His fur was patchy and mottled, but he looked strong, and full of violence. \r\n\r\nOne of the officers falls, neck spraying blood, the flesh creatures close in, and I see dark shadows near the edge of the treeline. \r\n\r\nJunior charges into the homonculai, gunfire having no effect on the displaced monster, he makes short work of the last of Ed\u2019s children. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m sweating, panicked, overwhelmed by the chaos of the forest. \r\n\r\nI see the toad faced woman, giggling to herself, and point to cars as they come within eyeshot.  Each one makes a dangerous u turn before they get too close. \r\n\r\nI see James, calmly watching the events assured out the outcome. \r\n\r\n I see junior, moving through the trees like a bladed wind, dragging the Forest creature out of it\u2019s illusion. The fight is one sided, neither gunfire, nor the flames of Mike\u2019s cursed matches harmed the half-wood thing, but Juniors claws, and twisted, randomly angled teeth tear through her oaken skin like paper. \r\n\r\nAnd finally, I see Mike, the look we share is a conversation. \r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t a cluster fuck that the watchers just pulled us out of. No, this was all to carefully planned out, this required way too many moving pieces. \r\n\r\nWhatever deal they struck with Ed, it was pretense, it was the foot in the door they needed to set up this situation, to get the tree-thing. \r\n\r\nJames makes Mike call junior off before it can decapitate the creature, confirming my suspicions. Albert makes the remaining three police officers load it\u2019s limbless, mangled form into a U-Haul truck. \r\n\r\nIt truly sinks in that this group of elderly psychonaughts, they have power, reach and motives neither Mike nor Myself actually understand. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve never needed a line so bad in my life.\n\n\nLink to Part 3\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/145thkq/finding_art_part_3_infinite_oldsmobile/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button",

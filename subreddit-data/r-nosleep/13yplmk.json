    "postText": "I know this sounds crazy. Shut up. I get it. I\u2019ve heard it all before: \u201cwhat are you talking about?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201d \u201cThis is why you shouldn\u2019t do molly before your brain finishes developing.\u201d My friends don\u2019t believe me. My parents don\u2019t believe me. My therapist doesn\u2019t believe me. And I don\u2019t blame them. I didn\u2019t believe me either, at first. Maybe I still don\u2019t. There\u2019s no moral here; this isn\u2019t some cautionary tale about the importance of keeping clean. If it were, it\u2019d be the sickest, most twisted way to teach someone to fold their stupid clothes.   \n\nI normally fold my laundry. I do. I\u2019m not a slob! I hate walking into my bedroom and seeing clothes on the floor. I hate it, seriously! I don\u2019t believe in it, don\u2019t subscribe to it, and don\u2019t condone it. The floor could be as clean as a freshly zamboni\u2019d ice rink, but the second my clothes touch it they instantly get dirty \u2013 coated in lint, dust, and grime that latch onto my shirts and underwear like leeches. \n\nBut no one\u2019s perfect. I\u2019m not an idiot, ok? I\u2019m a realist. I\u2019m an adult. I slip up sometimes. A bit of depression here, a dash of anxiety there, and suddenly I don\u2019t feel like folding that huge lump of clothes the exact second the dryer vomits them out. In those cases, I put the pile on my desk chair, and I wait a few days. I go to work, I run my errands, I wash my face, and, whatever \u2013 you get the gist. Eventually, I work up the courage to square up to that foul fabric beast and tear it apart, devoting twenty minutes to folding and putting away every single piece of clothing until my room is back to its normal, serene state. This cycle is a perfectly normal part of the monotonous yet inconsistent ebb and flow that is adulthood, and I\u2019m not going to put myself on trial for occasionally succumbing to it.  \nWell, the last load of laundry I did was a particularly big one. Massive, actually. So big I thought the washing machine drum would break off its axle, spin out into my kitchen, and crash through a wall. After the clothes dried, I let them sit in the machine for a few days because taking them out proved too daunting a task (and yes, I opened the dryer door a bit so the clothes could air out. I\u2019m not an idiot).  \n\nEventually, I worked up the courage to extract the atrocious textile pile and take it to my room for folding. The pile was too big and too heavy to fit on my chair, so I threw it on the ground. I know, I know \u2013 I\u2019m wincing at the thought. But I had too. It was enormous. At the time, folding felt like too herculean a task to do in that moment. So I waited a day. And another day. And another. I went to work, I ran my errands, I washed my face. By then, a week had gone by, and the pile was still there, on the floor at the foot of my bed. I went to bed that night promising myself I would deal with it in the morning.\n\nWell, girls and boys, I didn\u2019t deal with it. That day I did nothing; I did nothing but go to work, run my errands, and wash my face. And that evening I opened a beer, plopped my ass on the couch, and watched \u201cNew Girl.\u201d I hate that show. I despise that show. But I watch reruns when my body is tired but my mind is awake; when I need something to dull my brain until it meets my body halfway on that miserable road to exhaustion. \n\nWhen I crawled into bed that night, the laundry pile was still there, obviously. A sock was sticking out and touching the foot of my bed. It was funny, though, because I didn\u2019t remember the pile physically touching my bed the night before. But who really remembers things like that, anyway? I figured the pile must have come apart a bit due to vibrations in the floor when I walked -- gravity, or something. It was a bulbous, globular, uneven stack of clothes, for fuck\u2019s sake. I know this sounds silly \u2013 it\u2019s just that my first thought when I saw the pile had shifted slightly towards my bed wasn\u2019t that it was actively moving towards me. \n\nI have bad dreams often, but that night\u2019s was especially bad. I dreamt I stepped into an enormous bowl of pancake batter and couldn\u2019t get out. I sunk into the batter, slowly, tortuously, inch by inch, until the beige mass globbed onto my face. Just as it covered my eyes and stuck them shut, I suddenly woke up with a shooting pain in my foot. The pain was almost indescribable: a burning, almost acidic sensation. It subsided immediately the moment I woke up and drew my legs up to my chest, curling into the fetal position and rubbing my foot until my mind coaxed itself to sleep. \nWhen I woke up that morning, my thoughts returned to that brief pain in my foot. I almost couldn\u2019t even remember if it had been a dream or not. Until I looked at my foot. The top half of my left sole was a patchy red color. I grabbed hold of the foot and held it up as close to my face as my inflexible body could manage. My brow furrowed in disgust. I had the same expression in my face as when I was sixteen and riddled with acne and would pop an innocuous-looking zit, only for it to erupt and bukkake my mirror with an egregious quantity of pus. My disgust, however, then morphed into an acute sense of unease. Because there, in the center of this rosy patch on my foot, were four small indentations. They were deep in my skin, as far as you can press down on flesh before drawing blood. Each mark was parallel to the other. Bite marks.  \n\nI looked at my foot, then at the foot of my bed (no pun intended), where the pile of laundry sat. Then back at my foot. Then back at the pile. Something about it was different now. I swear it, suddenly it looked a bit more ominous, more looming, more\u2026 big. Yes, it was bigger. It had taken on a new color, too. A pair of jeans, my rainbow socks, and a Grand Theft Auto 5 T-shirt that I hadn\u2019t seen before on the top of the pile were now sticking out, looking right at me. It\u2019s strange; you don\u2019t expect a pile of clothes to activate your fight or flight response, but looking back on that moment now, even if my conscience didn\u2019t register it at the time, I was afraid. \n\nI got up, got dressed with whatever clothes remained in my closet away from the pile (not much), and shut my bedroom door. I went to work that day, I ran errands, I washed my face. I went home. I changed clothes. As I changed, I stared at the pile. Now there wasn\u2019t just a single sock touching the foot of the bed \u2013 now many, many socks were pressed against it, reaching out like little white hands of cotton. In fact, the whole pile seemed to be pushing its weight against my bed. But, like I said earlier, this was not something I consciously decided to worry about in that moment. It\u2019s a pile of laundry, for fuck\u2019s sake. I walked into the living room and shut the door behind me. I decided then that that night I would finally dismantle the pile and fold each and every piece of clothing. But not right then. My buddy Sam was coming over any second to have a beer and watch \u201cNew Girl.\u201d  \n\nHe got to my place twenty minutes later than he was supposed to, and when I opened the door four little legs trotted in with him. \u201cThis is Clarence!\u201d he said with that bizarrely prideful tone in his voice that new dog owners sometimes have. It\u2019s the same tone new mothers have, but since, as far as I know, humans are not physically capable of giving birth to chihuahuas, the tone in this case is always completely unwarranted. But I digress -- I was a little pissed, to say the least. Sam hadn\u2019t asked if it was ok to bring Clarence. \nWe were about five minutes into a random episode I had rouletted from season three when Clarence started yapping. I peeled my eyes off the screen and suddenly realized he wasn\u2019t on the couch with us anymore. Indeed, he was standing right in front of my closed bedroom door, howling into the air and clawing at the wood. \n\u201cYo, Clare! Shut up!\u201d Sam yelled as he paused the TV and sauntered over to Clarence. My first thought was *Is \"Clare\" really a nickname for Clarence?* My second thought was *Oh my god. Do not let Clarence into that room.*\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d I blurted out.  \n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Sam grunted as he turned to look at me with that big stupid face of his. Clarence kept barking. \n\n\u201cYou\u2026 you can\u2019t go in there,\u201d I stammered. \u201cIt\u2019s messy.\u201d I straightened myself up. \n\nSam scoffed. \u201cYou got dead bodies in there or something?\u201d He looked at Clarence, who refused to let up. \u201cSomething\u2019s bothering him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can see that, but \u2013\u201c\n\nSam laughed, put his hand on the knob and started to turn.\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d I screamed again. Clarence stopped barking that time. \nSam took his hand off the knob. \n\n\u201cI told you. Don\u2019t go in my room,\u201d I chided. \n\n\u201cDude. You\u2026 you don\u2019t actually have dead bodies in there, do you?\u201d Sam asked as his smile gradually disappeared. \n\nI sighed. \u201cJesus Christ. Of course not! It\u2026 it\u2019s just messy. Super messy. Like, so messy. It\u2019s embarrassed.\u201d \n\n\u201cOK. But now I feel like, as your friend, I have a responsibility to check. Just to make sure\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, well, I told you, you can\u2019t go into my room.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 just to make sure you don\u2019t have any dead bodies in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI DON\u2019T HAVE ANY DEAD FUCKING BODIES IN MY ROOM!\u201d My face went purple with rage. \n\n\u201cWell now you\u2019re reacting as if you have a dead body in your room.\u201d\nI sighed and rubbed my forehead. He had a point. \u201cOk. You can look inside\u2026 just\u2026 can you pick Clarence up first?\u201d\n\nSam looked at me weirdly, but then quickly accepted this one condition and picked the little hairy sausage up. He grabbed the knob and turned. I held my breath as he looked inside. \n\n\u201cOh my god. Dude. What the shit?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat? What?\u201d I raced to the door and peered inside. The room was more or less the same as it had been that morning. Well, except for the laundry pile had\u2026\n\n\u201cYou should really fold your laundry, dude.\u201d   \n\n\u2026 doubled in size. It was massive, over half the height of the room now, spilling across my bed. I started to shake. How was this happening? What was happening? There were more clothes in the pile now than I had ever owned in my entire life. And, I suddenly realized, I was no longer able to recognize the clothes themselves. While before I could clearly identify individual pieces within the pile \u2013 my red plaid boxers, my cargo shorts, a lone Nike sock \u2013 the mass now took on an abstract and mind-boggling shape. It was as if the clothes had stretched, twisted, even fused themselves together. Clashing colors bled into each other like watercolors. Disparate textures met at messy seams like some sort of scratchy, monstrous quilt. \n\nSam, clearly not understanding the apparent danger of this\u2026 this thing in my room, took a step forward. \n\n\u201cNO!\u201d I blurted out. I said that a lot that night. And I would say it again soon.\n\n\u201cWhat is going on with you, man?\u201d A condescending smile curled over that idiot\u2019s lips. I couldn\u2019t even begin to tell him. It was all too ridiculous. And yet, I had never been so terrified.  \n\n\u201cDo you wanna go on a walk? Let\u2019s go on a walk.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Sam said with that stupid, stupid face of his cocked at such a severe angle it looked like his neck would snap in half. \n\nMy eyes turned to Clarence, who was still in Sam\u2019s clutches and staring at the pile with wide, terrified eyes. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t peed in a while. Let\u2019s take him outside! Let\u2019s take him for a walk!\u201d I pleaded. \n\nSam looked at Clarence, who didn\u2019t even register his dear owner\u2019s gaze. His eyes were locked on the pile. He was trembling. \n\n\u201cEh. He\u2019s fine! You really should fold your laundry, though. I\u2019ll help.\u201d He walked towards the pile. \n\n\u201cNO!\u201d \n\n\u201cOK, can you calm the actual fuck down, dude?\u201d He turned to me again. Clarence squirmed in his arms. He whimpered and gnawed at the air, his little black eyes as if pleading, \"let me down. Let me go.\"\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck, Clare?\u201d Clarence managed to wiggle his way out of Sam\u2019s grasp and hit the floor like a billiard ball. Immediately he twisted himself onto his feet and scurried out of the room. \n\n\u201cMaybe he does have to pee,\u201d Sam wondered aloud. I sighed with relief.\n\n \u201cYes! Let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut first we gotta deal with this.\u201d He turned back to the pile. \n\n\u201cLater, Sam. Please.\u201d \n\n\u201cNah, bro. This is insane. It\u2019s one thing to put off chores for a couple days, but this\u2026 this is mental illness,\u201d He crouched down, right next to the pile, and reached out. \u201cI can\u2019t let you live like this -- \u201d\n\nThen there was movement. A flash of color. A sudden jerk. A lunge. Of polyester and cotton and wool and linen. A brief yelp -- \u201coh!\u201d--  managed to escape Sam\u2019s lips just before the pile swallowed him whole. \n\nI stood there like an idiot, frozen in terror as the pile contorted and undulated with Sam inside, re-arranging his big body like a snake swallowing a deer. The most vile and disturbing sounds I\u2019ve ever heard accompanied Sam\u2019s muted screams from inside: tearing, crunching, dissolving, guzzling. Sam let out one final blood-curdling scream before a nauseating POP rang out and everything went quiet. The pile was still now. A putrid smell filled the air, like the smell of raw chicken left out to rot on a hot concrete patio. Death. \n\nThen, right before my eyes, the pile began to grow, metastasizing with new lumps of fabric sprouting in all directions. The smell got thicker and heavier with each inch the pile grew. It wasn\u2019t until it reached the ceiling that I was able to rouse myself from my shock and I turned and ran out of the room. I grabbed Clarence, who had been scratching pathetically at my front door in a desperate bid to escape, and fled my apartment. I ran down the street. I ran down the block. I just ran. I ran for hours, in no particular direction, with Clarence in my arms. \n\nIt\u2019s been two weeks. I\u2019m writing this now from a motel room. I don\u2019t know what motel it is. I ran into the first one I came across and haven\u2019t left since. Clarence is fast asleep on the bed. He\u2019s ugly and annoying, but I\u2019ve found myself yelling \u201cClare!\u201d when I want to get his attention. I haven\u2019t been back to my apartment since that day. I\u2019m never going back. I don\u2019t want to know what\u2019s in there, how much bigger it\u2019s become. \n\nI\u2019m still wearing the same clothes from that day. My shirt and pants are heavy with sweat. I smell like shit. But it\u2019s fine because I\u2019m not changing my clothes. I\u2019m not cleaning my clothes, either. Maybe I will, one day. Not for a long time, though. And if I do ever get around to it, I swear to God -- I\u2019m folding them immediately.",

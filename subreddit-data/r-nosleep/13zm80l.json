    "postText": "Welcome to Camp Redwood! The feel-good camp for ALL AGES.\n\nWe toast marshmallows around the fire, tell spooky ghost stories, and hide in random secret military bunkers under the campgrounds! Because [SOMETHING IS HERE WITH US.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13tfgs0/camp_redwood_are_running_out_of_counsellors_these/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\nCamp Redwood is the PERFECT PLACE for a summer getaway where we start EVERY DAY with a CAMP REDWOOD SMILE.  Where our counselors disappear every five minutes, and our campers disembowel us for funsies! Did I forget to mention our littles aren\u2019t actually eight years old, but fully grown adults?  \n\nWe hope you enjoy your fucking stay! \n\nWe are also not responsible for any counselors revealing they are not who they said they are\u2014and not who they appear to be.\n\n... \n\nSo. There\u2019s a LOT to tell you and not a lot of time to tell it.\n\nRight now, I suppose you could say we are under lockdown\u2014if that is the word. I want to go over the last several days to get you up to date. That\u2019s all I can do right now. I can hope and pray the thing with Teddy\u2019s voice does not get in here, and once again cry out for help\u2014that I know is not coming. Not from the authorities, at least. But hey, if any of you fancy coming to rescue us, we\u2019re in the middle of the Canadian wilderness. The closest rest-stop is maybe three fucking hours away. So have fun. Has it really almost been a week since I posted? Well, we\u2019re still here! \n\nAnd surprise, surprise, help is not coming. So, please excuse the salt. I am seventeen years old and I have been abandoned by the adults who were supposed to be looking after us. \n\nWho were supposed to act under protocol if something like this happened. I know they were waiting for it\u2014there are specific fucking guidelines on an emergency evacuation for counselors if this ever happened. But then the little shits took over before we could do anything. I guess I\u2019ll start by letting you know that there are two of us   left. (three, if we count Rowan, but I\u2019m not). What I thought was going to be a quiet summer getaway with kids my age has turned into a nightmare.\n\nFor one, we have been cornered inside the head counselor\u2019s underground secret bunker. If you want to know why she has a secret military bunker, I guess you should keep reading.\n\nBecause shit gets weirder than animal crackers having the power to turn adults into kids, and vice versa. When I made my first post, I thought that was it for us. I thought for sure there must have been a self-destruct somewhere\u2014which meant whoever was running this camp was waiting for something like this. I was sure we were going to die, so after making the post, I have to admit with ya\u2019ll\u2014I just slept. I curled up, tried to ignore Harry and Carmel calling our names through childish laugher, and went to sleep with the thought in my head that I was completely at peace with what I had done with my life. \n\nSure, I was young. Seventeen years old is too young to be ripped apart by littles who are in fact grown adults. But as I was falling into slumber and allowing myself to fall, with my head resting in my lap, my head turned towards a separate pile of files on the other side of the room\u2014I realized I really wanted to know how this was possible. There was so much I needed to know. Why did eight-year-old Eleanor Summers have a file where here birthday dated back to 1979? Why had supposedly innocent sugary snacks turned our adorable littles into mini psychopaths?\n\nThese kids were not kids, somehow. But how? How was that even possible? Could it be that the files were wrong?\n\n1979 was definitely 45.\n\nBut Eleanor Summers couldn\u2019t be 45 years old. I knew what 45 looked like. I knew that they thought like. They spent half of their time on Facebook laughing at outdated memes, and the other half\u2026 I don\u2019t know, working? They have job\u2019s! They\u2019re happily married with kids, maybe soon grandkids! That was not Eleanor Summers. Because Eleanor Summers was most definitely eight years old.  I had played several rounds of teddy-bears picnic, and spent hours reassuring her that Harry's ghost stories were in fact not real, enough times for me to know that this little kid was little\u2014and a kid.\n\nBut something was bothering me. More than the secret military bunker, and magic age-regressing  animal crackers. When I first signed up to Camp Redwood, one of the tag-lines to gain attraction had been, \u201cSolve mysteries in the woods in the dead of night, with nothing but a flashlight and your fellow campers!\u201d I had no idea I would be solving this thing on my own, trapped inside a bunker.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Rowan, who was still looking through Allison\u2019s dinosaur laptop, turned to me with half lidded eyes, when I slowly got to my feet, careful not to make too much noise, and crept over to the pile of separate files which seemed to be crumbling apart from age. He kept his voice low, but it sounded almost like a whine. He could have been scared, but from the way he was sitting, cross-legged with a frowny face, I figured something must have been going on with him. The guy looked tired. More tired than normal.\n\nThe bags under his eyes were practically shadowing his face, and were an odd contrast to unusually ashy colored cheeks and slightly dilated eyes. Still though, Rowan refused to look vulnerable. I caught glimpse of Harry\u2019s raybans sitting on his head, pinning back thick dark brown curls from falling in front of sleepy eyes.   Maybe he was finally losing his cool and breaking out of the well-constructed fa\u00e7ade he had been hiding behind since Teddy disappeared.\n\nWe had just narrowly escaped a crowd of psycho littles high on age-regressing sugary snacks who were doing who-the-fuck knows to the other counselors who had been captured, so I didn\u2019t blame him looking like that. I guess he couldn\u2019t look me in the eye, because in Rowan\u2019s mind, he was the reason why this happened. He was the leader, and the camp had fallen to psychopathic little eight year olds who had taken half of the counselors hostage, and the other half\u2014most likely taken apart in the physical sense, after what we had witnessed in Cassie\u2019s cabin. Still though, it wasn\u2019t Rowan\u2019s fault. He could sit there and pull a face all he wanted, it\u2019s not like I was going to blow up at him for getting us stuck down here. He actually saved us. \n\nAnd trapped us, judging from the footsteps upstairs, Carmel and Harry still bouncing around looking for us. \n\nIt was a game in their heads.  The little\u2019s thought it was cat and mouse. Harry and Carmel were the oblivious cats prowling, while we were the mice, hoping to fucking GOD we weren\u2019t caught and eaten. Ignoring Rowan, I glimpsed what looked like a box full of DVD\u2019S\u2014all of which were labelled with dates and names. I saw familiar ones, my heart racing into my throat. Phoebe. Eli. Cassandra.\n\nEach DVD had one of the kid\u2019s names scribbled on the front, as well as a date.\n\nI found Eleanor\u2019s right at the back of the box.\n\nEleanor Summers.\n\n08/05/2021. (PM)\n\nBefore I could hesitate and think what I was doing, I slid the DVD into the portable player attached to the MacBook.  Rowan, to my surprise, didn\u2019t move. But he did make an acknowledging noise when the screen flickered to what looked like video footage. Peering at the screen, I found myself staring at a small white room. There was no door. Only a wooden desk and a chair, and sitting on it was a middle aged woman with dark blonde curls tied into a strict ponytail. She was wearing what looked like a prison jumpsuit. \n\nHer eyes were eerily glued to the camera, unblinking. Her wrists were cuffed in front of her. Though from the look on her face, she saw the restraints as a game. Her eyes lit up with intrigue and I could practically see the cogs in her mind starting to turn as she struggled with them. \n\nAs soon as I saw this woman, I felt all of my nerve endings set alight. I wanted to turn the screen off, or look away. But once I was looking at the screen, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tear my eyes away. \u201cLet\u2019s try this again.\u201d There was a woman offscreen. She sounded young. Too young to be in that kind of authority. I figured there was no way teenagers were being hired as special ops agents, but I guessed I was wrong. She cleared her throat. \u201cIt is 4:35 exactly. August 5th 2021. My name is Agent Lemrac,\u201d she stated. \u201cI am asking once again for you to comply with us. As I have said several times, the court are willing to lessen your sentence if you plead guilty with insanity.\u201d\n\nThe woman surprised me with a snorting laugh. She seemed to come alive, leaning forward with animated features, her brow reaching her hairline. She was acting like a child, bouncing up and down in the seat, her lips stretching into a wider grin. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. I could tell the woman was intentionally antagonising the interviewer.\n\n\u201cIt means you have been legally declared insane,\u201d the interviewer stumbled over her words slightly. \u201cMrs Summers, it would be in your best interest to work with us to lessen your current sentence which at the moment is standing at,\u201d the sounds of shuffling paper crackled through the speakers. The interviewer cleared her throat again rustling paper. \u201cThirty six years. Without parole.\u201d\n\nThe woman didn\u2019t speak, only continued to smile\u2014and the interviewer delved further into the sentence. \u201cIf you do in fact plead guilty with declared insanity, you will be sentenced to a program which is in the process of supporting and rehabilitating people with your\u2026\u201d she caught herself for a moment. I could tell this interviewer had a biased opinion and it was definitely showing through her interviewing style. I could hear the rapid intakes of her breath as she hurried through what seemed to be a script she was reading from. \u201cConditions.\u201d She finished. \u201cThe Redwood program aims to help people exactly like you.\u201d\n\nRedwood? I thought.\n\nLike\u2026 Camp Redwood?\n\nRowan whistled behind me. I guess I could call that a reaction. The guy was probably still in shock after seeing Caf\u00e9 de Teddy splattered all over little Cassie\u2019s cabin floor. I should have known those little bitches weren\u2019t playing Operation for eight hours straight. Turning my attention from Rowan and back to the screen, the woman in the jumpsuit appeared to have changed tactics. Her expression twisted into nonchalance. She leaned back in her chair. \u201cI am not pleading insane because I am not insane.\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs Summers\u2014\u201d\n\nThe woman cut her off.  \u201cI am not crazy.\u201d She raised her hands  \u201cI am doing what needs to be done.\u201d She leaned forward. \u201cHumanity suffers in the skin. We age and die\u2014 and how is that fair? What if we want to see the next millennium? And the next two millennia after that? Why should our bodies dictate our lifespan? Why should we sit here and wait to rot and wither and die when we have the intelligence and mindset to do it? If nobody else is willing to throw ethics aside to take a step forwards in human evolution, I should do it myself.\u201d She folded her arms across her chest, again, like a child. \u201cI did what was to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cDr. Summers.\u201d The interviewer\u2019s tone grew stiff. \u201cYou and your colleagues conducted illegal and unethical procedures on your family and friends\u2014as well as four other victims.\u201d\n\nThe woman inclined her head. \u201cYou have a daughter, am I correct? I have a son.\u201d\n\n\u201cA child you killed, Dr Summers.\u201d The interviewer retorted in a hiss which was definitely expressing emotion. She ignored the mention of her daughter, but I could tell it had rattled her to her core. Her voice had cracked. This case was close to her. \n\nThat was obvious. Without seeing the interviewer herself, I could sense how uncomfortable she was, shuffling in the chair. Every so often I would hear the sound of her rubbing her hands on her knees and tapping her shoe against the chair leg. She oozed anxiety, not just from her tone of voice, but the way the frame seemed to move with her. \u201cDr. Summers, you  used your son in your research, along with several of his friends. This was not science.\u201d Her voice shook. I heard her sharp inhale. Unprofessional, but very human. Instead of staying stoic and keeping to script, this agent was cracking apart.  \u201cIt was murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgent Lemrac, concentrate on the interview only.\u201d An official voice crackled through what sounded like an intercom on screen.\n\n\u201cGot it.\u201d She spoke through her teeth.\n\nThe woman was finding wounds and pressing on them. She was scanning the interviewer for vulnerabilities and preying on every insecurity. She leaned back speaking through a sigh. \u201cWithout my son\u2019s sacrifice we wouldn\u2019t have created an answer to death. To growing old and dying, and leaving loved ones behind.\u201d Her voice softened into a murmur, but I didn\u2019t trust it.\n\nAfter identifying the shattering pieces of this interviewer which were very clear visible in her view, the woman was taking advantage.\n\n\u201cAgent Lemrac, you have a daughter. Am I correct in saying her name is Mari?\n\n\u201cThat\u2026 that is not relevant.\u201d  \n\n\u201cGlioblastoma.\u201d Dr. Summers lips curved into a sickening smile hidden behind mocking sympathy. \u201cA sickness of the brain--which, unfortunately, I cannot fix. If your daughter\u2019s brain was in my hands, I would try. However, not even a brand new body would help her. One which would never age or grow sick. And for that, I am deeply, deeply sorry.\u201d She reached her cuffed hands forwards. \u201cMy condolences, Agent Lemrac. Honestly. I have to hand it to you. You are incredibly brave for coming here today and talking to me while abandoning your sick child.\u201d She shook her head. \n\n\u201cYour daughter is dying of an incurable illness, suffering inside fragile skin which will break and fall apart and be unable to keep her standing for much longer.  While my son will live on forever. He will see every millennia, a planet which will crumble and build itself back together. And maybe the end of the universe itself.\u201d There was a twitch in her expression and a glitter in her eye I did not recognise. Insanity. \n\nShe was fucking insane. I was seeing the pure of it, the depraved and disgusting gleam in eyes empty of remorse and regret. This woman did not care what she had done.  I could tell from the look on her face. If she had the chance, she would do this again.\n\nBut there was no way they were trying to say her cruelty and complete disregard for her son\u2019s life was due to insanity.\n\n\u201cYou are sick, Dr. Summers.\u201d The interviewer said after a moment of gathering herself.\n\nThe woman shook her head with a chuckle. \u201cI told you. I am not sick--\u201d  \n\n\u201cSick in the head!\u201d The interviewer\u2019s voice exploded through the speakers in a shriek\u2014a terrified cry she had been trying to hold in. I finally saw her\u2014or at least the back of her. She was a young woman with light blonde hair falling loose on her shoulders. She was trembling. Slamming her hands down on the table, she screamed at the orange jumpsuit woman. \n\n\u201cYou are psychologically fucked in the head! You psycho bitch! That is my sister!\u201d She spoke through strangled sobs rattling her whole body. \u201cMari is my little sister. She is not my child.\u201d \n\nHer breaths were strangled and harboured. I noticed figures looming in the background, but she was continuing. \u201cYou killed your own fucking son,\u201d she spat. \u201cYou are not legally insane, you are sick!\u201d she shrieked. \u201cYou planned and put this together! You sit there and you talk about your son like he\u2019s a\u2026 like he\u2019s a tool!  You deserve to rot. Do you hear me?\u201d I noticed the orange jumpsuit woman was still smiling, satisfied with the interview\u2019s reaction.  Her words were spoken in a vicious poison as she leaned forward and spat directly in orange jumpsuit\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cAgent Lemrac!\u201d Whoever her superiors were\u2014were panicking. \u201cI told you not to turn it off. I knew this was going to happen. Can we stop the demonstration, please? Human emotions present inside an Aceville soldier are too powerful\u2014\"\n\nVoices were murmuring in the background, and Agent Lemrac raised her hands. \u201cI want to stop.\u201d She choked out, her hands trembling. She spoke like she still had control over the situation and wasn\u2019t being apprehended.  \u201cI want to stop. Do you hear me?\u201d The interviewer was crying, I realized. \u201cStop the recording! I can\u2019t do this. Oh god, I think I\u2019m going to be sick\u2014\u201d\n\nWhen the footage ended in a burst of static, I found myself backing away, something slimy creeping its way up my throat.\n\nThe woman in the orange jumpsuit who had murdered her son and countless others in what sounded like an attempt at playing god, was Eleanor Summers. I thought back to Teddy\u2019s corpse, and the surgical precision of every organ\u2019s removal. The young interviewer had mentioned colleagues of Eleanor. \n\nWas it possible that Camp Redwood was in fact nothing more than a rehabilitation camp for murderous criminals?  There was a loud bang from above, and I was torn from my thoughts. \n\nI turned to Rowan, who had been unusually quiet. And I realized why, when I twisted around to find him three inches from my face, his laboured breath tickling my cheek. \n\nThe boy jumped back with a chuckle\u2014like me noticing him was some kind of game,  before diving back into the chair. I did notice something odd, as my thoughts spiralled. Rowan couldn\u2019t sit still. Slumped in the leather spinning chair, he fingers tapped a rhythm on the armrests while his feet jumped up and down. In the dim light of the bunker, I glimpsed a sheen of sweat glistening on his forehead and the flesh of his neck. He looked to be\u2026 feverish\u2014and now that I was looking at him properly, all of my attention on the boy, I noticed small things which seemed\u2026 off about him.\n\nFor one, he wasn\u2019t coming up with a plan. Rowan always had a plan. Even if he wasn\u2019t completely sure of it, or was completely winging it. This time though, he was strangely quiet. I found my voice when he stuck out his tongue at me. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\n\n\u201cRowan.\u201d I spoke softly, careful not to garner attention from above us where Harry and Carmel were still clamouring around, playing games. \u201cAre you\u2026 feeling okay?\u201d I asked, when he turned back to the laptop, manically biting his fingernails.\n\n\u201cI dunnnooooo, Josie! Am I feeeeeeling okaaaaaayyyyy?\u201d  He surprised me with an uncharacteristic laugh.\n\nBut I did know it.\n\nI knew it from earlier when he reacted to Allison\u2019s bunker and I had been too freaked out to realize that I was dragging along the enemy with me.\n\nBecause the fucking idiot had consumed animal crackers. I had seen him for myself earlier, pouring a pack into his mouth for a snack. Which meant either the \u2018kids\u2019 had intentionally dosed him with mind altering sugary snacks, or the more likely, he could not resist those preservatives which was the equivalent of caffeine.  It\u2019s not like I could blame him when he harboured the weight of an entire camp, but come on, did he really have to sacrifice his own fucking mind to keep himself awake?\n\nRowan wasn\u2019t just biting. His nails. He was gnawing. Which he previously thought was a filthy habit. He had yelled at a camper for chewing on her nails a few days earlier. \n\nNow that I was noticing it, I couldn\u2019t\u2026 stop noticing it. The boy\u2019s whole demeanour had changed; the way he was sinking into the chair, instead of sitting up straight like usual\u2014- I used to call it having a stick up his ass. The boy started typing on the laptop, ignoring me. But when I watched the pattern of his fingers, he was just typing gibberish. Footsteps pounded above us, Harry and Carmel acting as the kid\u2019s\u2019 brainwashed foot-soldiers. Or, more likely somehow, if the animal crackers had caused the littles, or I guess, the fully grown forty year old criminals, to relapse in age-- then maybe it was possible for the same thing to happen to us. To Rowan.\n\nI could feel myself starting to back away, but there was nowhere to run. I just slammed into a cupboard. My gaze flicked to Rowan again, who was tapping a beat on the laptop tracking pad, swaying back and forth, his eyes elsewhere before his gaze found mine. \u201cMarcoooooo!\u201d Harry shouted from above, giggling with Carmel. \n\nI had to guess their mental age had to be at least 8-10 years old. Which meant I wasn\u2019t just dealing with a camp full of forty-year-old psycho\u2019s, I was also dealing with mentally relapsed counselors acting like toddlers.\n\nRowan seemed to jolt in the chair, twisting his head around, his eyes suddenly incredibly childlike and playful, and very Un-Rowan, were finding the ceiling, his mouth stretching into a smile, like he was seeing butterflies. His eyes flashed to me, and I caught a twitch in his lip. I knew that look. It was the look on my seven year old sister, who knew mom was mad at me, and wanted to make it even worse. \n\nHis cheeks were starting to blossom scarlet from what must have been the overwhelming urge to laugh. Rowan pressed his lips together and held in a breath like a hamster, and the asshole was fucking with me. Waiting for me to beat him to it by accident. Kids were fucking ruthless, but there was something terrifying about an 18 year old with a little kid\u2019s mind.\n\n I lifted my index to my lips, miming for him not to even try, but the boy just mimicked me, bugging out his eyes and pressing his finger to his grinning mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking dare.\u201d I managed to whisper. The boy was definitely playing his own game, moving in twitching movements, baiting me. When he cupped his mouth, I almost let out a cry, but then he dropped his arms with a giggle, as if to say, \u201cI\u2019m just kidding!\u201d \n\nSlowly, I turned around, grabbed the salt I\u2019d found in Allison\u2019s cupboard, and a flat can of soda. Without making too much movement, I poured a handful of salt into the can. But Rowan seemed to know exactly what I was doing. Because in the time it was taking me to advance towards him with the can of salty soda, one arm shakily ready to grab hold of him, and put him into a headlock, he was cupping his mouth, all logic and everything adult, everything he had been as our leader, igniting in playful eyes, leaving me the last one standing. \n\n\u201cPollloooooo!\u201d\n\nBy the time Rowan had managed to reveal our hiding place in a spluttered laugh, I had hold of the squirming boy, one arm wrapped around his neck, my other forcing the can of soda into his mouth. I had definitely miscalculated his strength. During camp Redwood activities, he was always the last one to come back from the trail, holding his knees and panting. I figured he was unfit. However, I was wrong. Underneath his shirt, the guy had some serious muscles.\n\nIt was like attacking a brick wall. However, Rowan was mentally a kid. So, I had my intelligence and logic on my side. When it became obvious I wasn\u2019t going to get anywhere with brute strength, I resorted to tickling him, which made him squirm, squeaking out a laugh. When he opened his mouth to yell at me to stop, I took my chance, thrusting the can into his lips and holding his nose so he swallowed it down.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d His laughter turned into muffled yelling, as he batted his fists at my chest. \u201cNo, no, no! Get off, get off!\u201d\n\nHis body convulsed as the salt did its job, causing the boy to lurch to his knees and choke up forbidden animal crackers in a gooish sludge which turned my stomach. By the time Rowan seemed half himself and half not, still kneeling, his head pressed against the floor, Harry was poking his head through the door with a goonish grin. \u201cFound you!\u201d He giggled, before forcing the door open, allowing Carmel and Callen, freshly caught and  mentally turned into littles, to advance down the stairs with equally terrifying grins. There was something wrong with Harry\u2019s face, and I only realized it when the guy himself was hauling me from the bunker, Carmel dragging a barely responsive Rowan. There was nothing in Harry\u2019s expression, only blind childish excitement at winning the game. When he dragged me out of Allison\u2019s cabin and threw me to the ground, I realized he too had insane strength I had not been expecting. But that thought quickly retracted when I was seeing his face in the light of a crescent moon lighting up the sky an eerie glow. Harry\u2019s cheeks were puffy and swollen, his right eye way bigger than it should have been. \n\nWhen he spoke, his voice was more of a lisp. This was something far more realistic than magical animal crackers fucking with his brain.\n\n\u201cHe needs help!\u201d I managed to choke out when Carmel wrapped jump-rope around my wrists. Next to me, Rowan was refusing to get up, still choking up salty soda, groaning into his hands. Every time Callen tried to restrain him, he hissed out like an animal.\n\n\u201cDo you hear me?!\u201d I struggled violently. \u201cHarry needs\u2014\u201d\n\nBANG.\n\nIs what it felt like. The feeling of something\u2014what felt and sounded like a toy car\u2014colliding with my temples, sent me onto the ground, my head spinning itself off of its axis. I remember lying on my back and frowning at the moon which almost looked like it was getting closer to me, blurring into a white ball of light\u2014before reality sunk in, and it was in fact Carmel\u2019s converse coming down to finish me off. I didn\u2019t stay knocked out for long. But I did dream. \n\nI think you can call it a dream? I was lying in bed at home; my room drowned in the dark. I was cosy, curled up in my blankets, when a clammy hand slammed over my mouth, rousing me from slumber. There were two figures in my room. They didn\u2019t have faces. They just existed as shadows, silhouettes. Before one of them raised something above their head, and\u2026 impact. \n\nIt was the same impact as the toy car hitting me, snapping me back to that night. It wasn\u2019t a dream. Because I remembered his clammy fingers over my mouth, and his hisses for me to shut up as he dragged me from my room. \n\nMy parents stood in front of me with expressions of sympathy. Basked in warm light, my mom and dad looked almost otherworldly. \u201cFor the best.\u201d Was what they mouthed when my own phantom screams slammed into me. I asked them why, and they didn\u2019t reply, allowing him to pull me further and further from what I knew, from my life as I knew it. But.. that couldn\u2019t be real. I had memories of getting on the bus to camp Redwood. I could recall the whole journey. So, why\u2026 why was my tangled mind saying otherwise?  \n\nWhen I gathered myself, the first thing I realized was I was sitting down. I was outside, cool night air grazing my bare arms. There was something attached to me, jerking violently, And it took me several disorienting blinks to understand that I was tied back to back with Rowan. My head pounded, and something wet and warm dripped down my temple. Great. I could add head injury to the long list of things to worry about.\n\n\u201cLet me go you little fucking witch.\u201d\n\nRowan was back to himself, though from the muffled hissing and the sound of choking\u2014I had to guess he was being force-fed animal crackers.\n\n\u201cLet me\u2014mpphmmm. little\u2026. fucking\u2026 mphmmphhmhppmm!\u201d\n\n\u201cRowan.\u201d I managed to get out in a croak. Through flickering eyes, I caught glimpse of a familiar figure dancing around us. Shivers rocketed down my spine, and I wrenched at the jump-rope restraints, but they did a surprisingly job of restraining my arms behind my back.\n\nEleanor was with Rowan, while Eli was knelt in front of me. Looking at him, the boy had definitely aged in the face\u2014and I couldn\u2019t help wondering what exactly he had done as a forty something year old to be sent to this place.\n\n\u201cJosie!\u201d Rowan responded in a wail. \u201cJosie. Wake the FUCK up.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop swearing.\u201d\n\nEleanor spoke with the cold tone of her actual age.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Rowan spluttered. \u201cFuck you.\u201d The boy\u2019s laugh was still rough from almost vomiting his insides out from too much salt intake. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you were a fucking boomer all along?!\u201d He wriggled in the restraints, lunging forwards, which sent me backwards.\n\n\u201cStop swearing, Rowan.\u201d Was all the girl responded with calmly.\n\n\u201cLike I\u2019m going to listen to you!\u201d He sneered. \u201cFuck, fuck, fuckity, fucking fuck!\u201d What are you going to do, huh? Bite me with your false teeth?\u201d The sound of saliva hitting skin made me wince. He was pissed. I had no doubt his completely rational anger was going to get us killed. Rowan was also somehow getting mixed up between forty and eighty. Though he was unwillingly snacking on mind bending sugary goodness.\n\n\u201cFudge, Rowan.\u201d Eleanor spoke in a giggle.\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\n\u201cSay fudge. Not fuck.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nHis hiss of pain caught me off guard. I don\u2019t know what she was doing to him, but it was hurting him.\n\n\u201cYou fudging fudge! I\u2019m going to fudging kill you when I get out of these fudging ropes\u2014\u201c his manic cursing became a muffled yell.\n\n\u201cSay fudge,\u201d Eleanor hummed, followed by his hiss when the palm of her hand skinned his cheek. \u201cFuck is a bad word. You even said so yourself and you\u2019re my favourite counselor.\u201d\n\nHe heaved out a breath.\n\n\u201cYou fudge,\u201d Rowan spat. \u201cWhen I get out of this, I am going to fudging kill you, you fudging\u2014\u201d His manic ranting morphed, once again, into muffled yelling, after another fistful of animal crackers were forced into his mouth. When I risked twisting around, I could see his rebellion slowly starting to simmer out as he relaxed slightly. I wanted to yell at him to keep a clear head before cold fingers were dipping under my chin and forcing my head around where I found myself face to face with Eli.\n\n\u201cI like you, Josie,\u201d he said, before untying me and pulling me to my feet. Now at the age of nine or ten, he was a lot stronger. When I tried to pull away, the cruel blade of a knife grazed my gut. I caught his grin. \u201cBut we don\u2019t need you.\u201d Eli pointed to Rowan.\n\n\u201cWe just want them.\u201d\n\nI followed his pointer finger which went from Rowan to Harry and Carmel, who were just standing there like fucking idiots, probably awaiting the next game. Harry\u2019s face was getting redder. It looked like he was suffocating, and yet his grin was growing wider and wider, splitting his lips apart.  \u201cRowan Atlas.\u201d Eleanor said, dragging him to his feet. Something was stapled to his forehead head, which caused him to howl in pain, hissing another strangled line of \u201cFudge\u201d. but I couldn\u2019t read what it was.\n\n\u201cCamp leader. Intelligent, and problem solving skills.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry Carlisle.\u201d Eli nodded his head with a smile. \u201cQuick thinker. Strong minded.\u201d\n\n\u201cCarmel Locke.\u201d Cassie spoke behind me. She had her arms folded, a wry smile on her lips. \u201cSmarter than she makes out\u2014- an independent learner, and can work well under pressure.\u201d\n\nLooking at these kids, I felt sick to my stomach. They were planning something\u2014and had the intelligence of renowned scientists, which was what I gathered from the footage on the MacBook. \u201cWhat?\u201d was all I could hiss out, as Eli prodded the blade of the knife into my back, ushering me to walk. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cDuh.\u201d He spoke in a more tweeny giggle. \u201cLike I said, Miss Josie. You\u2019re my favorite counselor but we don\u2019t need you, so I\u2019m going to use you for parts.\u201d He laughed when a shiver spiderwebbed down my spine. \u201cSee! I told you I was going to show you my collection!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 what do you need them for?\u201d\n\nEli pressed his index finger to his lips with a laugh before forcing me to face forwards. \u201cThat\u2019s a secret!\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t move, he shoved me into a stumbling power-walk, and I managed to turn my head quickly, making feverish eye contact with Rowan.\n\n\u201cRowan.\u201d I said calmly through the gutter in my throat. \u201cGet\u2026. Get help.\u201d\n\nIf I was going to die, I needed him to get a hold of himself and somehow alert the outside world what was going on.\n\n\u201cFrom whom, Josie?!\u201d He wailed back\u2014and as I was dragged away, I could once again sense the childish undertones in his voice.\n\nI had no choice but to obey Eli\u2019s orders. If I didn\u2019t want a knife in my back. He took me to the main lunch cabin, which, when I set foot inside, almost sent me to my knees. \n\nSomething lurched inside me, and I was screaming with no voice, staggering backwards, only to be shoved onto my face. In front of me was what had been the lunch hall, fully converted into the beginning of a laboratory. \n\nWhat had been cafeteria tables were fashioned into makeshift gurney\u2019s and beds, and I was looking at all of the missing counselors. Yuri and Noah had been skinned completely, their faces laid out on a makeshift surgical table. Joey had been ripped open, his heart and brain removed, a glittering metallic substance creeping its way across his forehead. It was then when I remembered Eleanor Summers words.\n\nShe wanted to prevent death and preserve the human mind. Looking at what was in front of me, this was the start of it. There was equipment I had never seen before. Lily\u2019s body was empty, carved out completely, tubes forced inside her. When I glimpsed her fingers move and begin to ball into a fist, I saw red. I saw fucking red. The exit was so close and yet Eli, fucking Eli, wielded his knife. I think that is when part of me gave up. My brain just stopped. It short circuited. Seeing my friends murdered and yet somehow being kept alive through playing god, my body slumped to the ground. I was numb. Completely numb. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what would have happened if those bloody saws and instruments which had been used on my friends were used on me too. \n\nLuckily, that did not happen. Before Eli could get his slimy hands on me, he crumpled to the ground in an almost cartoon-like fashion, and standing over me was Harry. Who was looking better. When he grasped hold of me and helped me up, I only had one word. \u201cOut.\u201d And he was nodding, his eyes glistening as he drunk in our friends\u2019 fate. \n\n\u201cHow?\u201d I managed to sputter out, when we made it out of the cabin, ducking behind a tree. Harry turned to me, motioning for me to shut up. There was a group of now ten to eleven year olds already running around, searching for what I guessed was him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m allergic to peanut butter,\u201d Harry murmured, his grasp tightening on my wrist as he led me across the camp, the two of us stumbling.\n\n\u201cWhat, and you just magically healed?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t respond to that, which bothered me.\n\n\u201cThe bunker is our best shot,\u201d I hissed out. \u201cI think we can get in contact with someone down there.\u201d I paused, unable to stop myself. \u201cWhat makes you so important?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno. Maybe I\u2019m their favorite.\u201d \n\nWhen we found Allison\u2019s cabin, which was more of a safehouse (an exposed safehouse) I found Rowan sitting on the wooden porch with his legs swinging over the side. \u201cRowan!\u201d Harry groaned. I found it hard to believe their roles had been switched. Now he was the one yelling at the camp-leader. \u201cI told you to stay inside!\u201d \n\nHe ushered the boy inside, before barricading the door with some hefty looking equipment. I could tell from the grin on his face that our so-called leader was once again no longer himself.\n\nI had to bite back a groan. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d I said, pointing to Rowan, who buried his head in his knees and blew a raspberry. \u201cDoes he look and act like our leader right now?!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Rowan, Josie.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a liability.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s our friend! Wouldn\u2019t Rowan do the same?\u201d\n\nYes, he would. But. He would also realize we\u2019re lost causes.\n\n\u201cGag him with something.\u201d I said. \u201cIf he makes any more noise, we\u2019re dumping him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a kid!\u201d\n\n\u201cJust the mind of one.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how animal crackers worked, but his age seemed to be progressively younger. This time he just sat with wide eyes watching us.\n\nHarry almost tore apart the place looking for means of communication, before an old fashioned ringing sound made me jump.\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Harry turned to me with his lip curled.\n\n\u201cHow am I supposed to know?!\u201d I hissed. \u201cKeep looking!\u201d But when I ducked under the table, my hands crawled under the desk, finding a wire\u2014and attached to that, an ancient looking phone which looked straight out of a 1940\u2019s movie, a bright green rotary phone.\n\nHesitantly, I answered it, lifting the phone to my ear. \u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you awaken the subjects, Agent Salta?\" \n\nThe voice on the other end was a woman, an oldish sounding woman with the tinge of a British accent.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I shot a look at Harry before shaking my head. \u201cNo. My name is Josie Greenfield. We\u2019re at Camp Redwood, and we need help.\u201d\n\nThe woman paused.\n\n\u201cWhere is Agent Salta?\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cThis line is reserved for communication with agents only.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who the fuck you\u2019re talking about!\" I squeaked out. \u201cMy name is Josie, and whatever is happening here, we need help!\u201d\n\n\u201cJosie. Did you awaken the subjects?\u201d\n\nI paused after a moment, shooting Harry a look when he tried to take the phone off of me. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd\u2026 are our agents unavailable?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a health and safety breach is activated, our agents are awakened to deal with the Project Spearhead subjects if they were to ever go rogue, or become conscious enough to think. Josie, can you tell me what is in front of you? Describe it to me.\u201d\n\nI held my breath. Next to the hidden phone under the desk was what looked like mismatched wires, all of which had been severed. I lowered myself slowly, poking at mess. \u201cWires. I see\u2026 cut up wires.\u201d I whispered. \u201cDoes this mean they know about you?\u201d\n\nShe hummed. \u201cAh\u2026That makes sense. The only way to activate our sleeper handlers  would be to send out the signal. You appear to have been sabotaged. Unless activated manually, our agents cannot help you. I am sorry. They are your problem now.\u201d The woman paused. \n\n\u201cIf I were you, I would hope and pray they have not sabotaged the self-destruct. If you find that, then you may be able to save yourselves and find peace.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cThank you for your service, Josie Greenfield.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait.\u201d I managed to get out. \u201cWait, no! You can\u2019t just\u2026 you can\u2019t leave us! We need help!\u201d\n\nI found myself yelling at nothing when the phone went dead. The dull tone of the dead ringtone was clanging in my ears before footsteps from up above. \u201cFuck this.\u201d Harry picked up a lead pipe. \u201cThey\u2019re still little kids, right? I mean, their head must still be partly kids\u2014- so let\u2019s fucking beat their heads in.\u201d \n\nHe noticed something, then, starting forwards towards the mess of files I had left earlier. Harry knelt on the ground and picked up Eli\u2019s file, his eyes wide. But he wasn\u2019t staring at the dates confirming the little boy\u2019s age.\n\nInstead, Harry pointed at the bottom of the file. \u201cI don\u2019t want to freak you out, Josie,\u201d he whispered. Initially, I didn\u2019t know what he was trying to show before I glimpsed notes scrawled at the bottom of the file, followed by a signature.  \u201cBut I\u2019m pretty sure that is my fucking writing.\u201d\n\nHarry was right.\n\nI pulled the paperwork off of him, flicking through each file before turning my eyes to him. \u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d \n\nA clanging sound from above broke the tension, and whatever Harry was about to reply with was strangled in his throat. He slammed a hand over his mouth.\n\n\u201cGuys?\u201d\n\nThe voice twisted me up inside, threatening to release a shriek from my mouth I had managed to clamp shut.\n\nTeddy.\n\n\u201cAre you down here?\u201d His voice was strained, and had an odd tone to it. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t see you.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nCan someone please tell me what the fuck is going on?! It\u2019s been a blur of a week. We\u2019ve managed to stay down here, surviving off of Allison\u2019s rations. Rowan isn\u2019t getting any better. He seems to have stopped mentally de-ageing at the age of maybe six. Harry has spent the last few days trying to get in contact with anyone, but it\u2019s like they are IGNORING US. \n\nI\u2019ve been looking through everything I can find on Project Spearhead, but nothing points to Harry being involved. So. How is his signature all over the files? How is it possible that two friends I thought I knew several days ago, are now complete strangers?\n\nTeddy keeps coming back.\n\nHe\u2019s crying out to us.\n\nI think he\u2019s\u2026 in pain.\n\nMy god, I can\u2019t stand this anymore. Please. CAMP REDWOOD NEEDS HELP.",

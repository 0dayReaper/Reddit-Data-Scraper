    "postText": "Welcome to Camp Redwood! \n\nAre you ready to fight to the death with age regressed forty year olds with the faces of adorable little kids?\n\nHow about coming to terms with your entire life, or at least five years of it, being one big fucking lie?\n\nWe are so excited to announce our &gt;!2018!&lt; group! Where you will undoubtedly [FIND](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13tfgs0/camp_redwood_are_running_out_of_counsellors_these/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) yourself here. Your true self. \n\nThe self you did not know existed. \n\nSO, jump in that military bunker, grab that blunt object to fight against our little campers disembowelling our counselors, and get yourself down to CAMP REDWOOD. WHERE WE START EVERY DAY WITH A CAMP REDWOOD SMILE. \n\nApply now!\n\nApplication end date: &gt;!05/02/2018!&lt;.\n\n \u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been a tough few days.\n\nSo, I think I will be posting this update in two chunks so I can get everything down and clear my head. I am alone right now.\n\nYes. I am the last survivor of Camp Redwood 2023 (?). I\u2019ve been unsure how to start this and end this because I really just want to get into the meat of what has been going on. \n\nBut\u2026 I must ask. I have to. \n\nWhat year is it? \n\nThat doesn't matter right now. I'll continue where I left off. \n\nTeddy did leave us alone in the end. But his screams were still haunting me hours after the thing with his voice had left. I don\u2019t even think I could call it his voice. \n\nIt sounded like him but there were pieces of him missing. Like someone had reached into the boy\u2019s mind and pulled out the skeleton of his consciousness, the bare bones of his being\u2014and cruelly stuffed him into a metal shell.\n\nThat is what Teddy sounded like. \n\nHe sounded like a wounded animal, confused why he was alive. Terrified. I now know what he is the product of. Teddy is a victim of horrifying, unethical experiments our campers have been forcing on kidnapped counselors after taking over the camp. Have you ever heard of the sound of crying which isn\u2019t human? \n\nThat is Teddy. He is the product of forcing life into the dead, and leaving it to suffer with its consciousness. Which, in my opinion, is a fate far worse than death. \n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering where my two companions are.\n\nWell, that is why I am writing this. \n\nI want to tell you what happened so I can wrap my head around it myself, and choose between killing all of us and sending these psychopaths to hell, or coming to terms with our truth and fighting back. Well, it\u2019s their truth. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s mine. It took us three whole days to get the guts to risk leaving Allison\u2019s secret bunker inside her cabin, and attempting to find a way out of this hell-hole. Harry and I were the ones to do it, leaving a still-not-completely-himself Rowan to guard our safehouse. I didn\u2019t want to leave him alone for a multitude of reasons but due to Harry actually having a soul and a semblance of empathy, I was overruled. \n\nDespite being heavily under the influence of age-regressing animal crackers which had mentally turned him into a toddler, Rowan was still himself to a degree. Which meant he was back to being our leader. I was sceptical at first, because no matter how many times he insisted he was in fact okay, I couldn\u2019t seem to shake off the feeling that the childish parts of him, the warped parts of his mind which had turned him into a child, were still there. \n\nEven if they were very subtle. I caught him doodling on his clipboard, and much later on, singing to himself with an odd smile on his face he had successfully gaslit Harry and I into believing it was just a coping mechanism. Say what you want about Rowan Atlas, he is damn good at swaying your opinion. Even when we were 100% sure Rowan was not his original self, the guy we had both met at the start of camp. \n\nIt was almost like him having two minds. The mind of a child, and the mind of a teenager. \n\nFor example, he still ordered us around and attempted to take back his role of leader\u2014 which had at least secured some normality back into our lives. But he also hated loud noises, and freaked out every time one of the littles tried to get in. There was also the incident we had agreed not to talk about, because talking about it meant facing the fact that our friend was no longer himself.\n\nIt was a hours after Teddy left us in peace. Harry was sleeping, and I was on the cusp of slumber, slipping through more files. Rowan had been oddly quiet. Which wasn\u2019t a Rowan thing. Whether he was mentally a child or a teenager, he was still being loud and obnoxious. I sat up to find him cross-legged, playing with something. \n\nI thought it was a worm at first, but no. It was exactly like what I found at the start of this, an eye attached to a nerve. But this time it was undoubtedly human, and now Rowan\u2019s plaything. When I questioned him, he said he was \u201cstudying\u201d it. Though there was definitely a difference between studying something and playing with it. The scary thing was, he saw no wrong in it, holding it in his hands and stripping off the metallic pieces cruelly attached to it. \n\nIn the end, I took it from him and stamped on it. Rowan didn\u2019t have the reaction I was expecting. Because he was still hiding behind the fa\u00e7ade that his mind hadn\u2019t been warped by de-aging animal crackers.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t bad enough, Eleanor Summers had given me a 24 hour deadline to hand over the boys, and we were well over the limit so an ambush was likely imminent.\n\nI still had so many questions. Why were Rowan, Harry and Carmel so important while the rest of us were seen as nothing but spare parts? \n\nThat is what the little bitch said. Now physically eleven years old with the mind of a deranged forty year old scientist, Eleanor told me I was nothing to them but spare parts. God, it\u2019s so weird calling her what she is after looking after her kid self, her fake self, for weeks. \n\nLittle Eleanor with her golden pigtails and obsession with teddy bear picnics was in fact a complete fucking sociopath. That much of one in fact, that her and her equally psychotic colleagues who engaged in these experiments had been regressed into little kids inside a rehabilitation camp (Nicknamed: Project Spearhead) which was supposed to fix them and had failed spectacularly. Because they\u2019ve taken over. And this time? We\u2019re the fucking lab rats. \n\nThe counselors here at Redwood.  \n\nI had seen her adult self being interviewed by mysterious Agent Lemrac, a face behind Project Spearhead, the girl who was far too young to be an agent, and have that kind of authority. Also, someone with a soul\u2014who had a clear biased opinion against the experiments. \n\nPart of me wondered if Lemrac still existed. Maybe she was behind the odd phone calls we kept receiving on an old fashioned rotary phone. With Eleanor\u2019s deadline in mind, the two of us made our journey quick. It wasn\u2019t hard to leave the camp itself. There were guards in the form of Callen and Olive, brainwashed and turned into the kid\u2019s muscle, but they were easy enough to get past as long as we distracted them with something shiny.\n\nThey were mentally six-years-old so literally anything grabbed their attention.\n\nI quickly realized my mistake once we managed to escape the camp\u2014Harry in front of me, with me lagging behind. We moved slowly, ducking behind trees and throwing ourselves into the dirt. Very cloak and dagger. It didn\u2019t take us long to slip into the woods. Just past the lake were the exit gates to Redwood which led to a road. \n\nNot exactly civilisation, but I would take it over having my body taken apart for \u201cparts\u201d in these so-called experiments. \n\nWhen we got to the gate, however, I realized I had given the adults too much fucking credit. \n\nWhoever was in charge of Spearhead clearly did not care about lingering survivors, as long as they were successfully cutting us out from the outside world. And that\u2019s what the giant wall I found myself staring at was, an impossible foot monster towering over us and cementing my earlier thoughts. We were screwed. The woman on the phone had made it clear we were being abandoned, and yet some of me naively held onto them maybe still rescuing us.\n\n\u201cFuck.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to do, but kicking the damn thing felt like the right thing. I did, and then regretted it half a second later. \n\nThis thing was impenetrable. Impossible to climb unless we had a fucking death-wish.\n\nBlinking at it through fraying sunlight blinding me, the thing almost resembled a mirage. It stood under the sun, a giant roadblock completely blocking us from any form of help.\n\nThe sun wasn\u2019t helping, scorching through my shirt. I swiped at my sweaty forehead, unable to resist a frustrated scream I had to muffle-gag with my hand. I risked a look behind us. Thankfully, we were around ten minutes away from the main camp. The lake was nearby glittering under a late afternoon sun, and all I wanted to right then was to wade into the shallows and let the murky water swallow me up. The little shits couldn\u2019t swim, maybe I\u2019d be safe.\n\n\u201cFuck!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is bad.\u201d Harry Carlisle broke the silence after my frustrated cry. With his eyes glued to the wall, he took off his hat and ran a hand through dark brown curls which were catching the light of the sun, setting strands alight across his forehead. None of us were in great shape after spending days hunkered down in a secret bunker. Harry was no exception. \n\nHis short sleeved camp Redwood shirt was still covered with vomit, discoloured with days\u2019 worth of sweat stains and lack of showers.  \n\nHe bent over, grasping hold of his knees. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d I could tell by the tone of his voice he was freaking out, and I didn\u2019t blame him. But Harry was still on my mind. \n\nHis signature was undoubtedly all over every Project Spearhead file, despite him repeatedly insisting he had nothing to do with it. At that moment, I could almost believe him. The boy looked exhausted and frustrated, pained. \n\nHe surprised me by slipping to his knees and burying his head in the dirt and screaming into rough soil. I was struck, then, by the sudden memory of flames. I had been sitting around campfires for weeks at Redwood, but this one didn\u2019t feel like it took place at camp. \n\nInstead, it felt more personal. I could almost see it, flickering orange sparking at the backs of my eyes and the sour taste of beer in my throat. Like the memory was trying to push itself to the surface. This moment felt nostalgic and yet close\u2014as if it had happened yesterday. Like both the past and present had entangled in one.\n\nIf I concentrated I swore I could hear the murmur of voices, phantom laughter in my head and a cool night breeze grazing my cheeks.\n\n\u201cEarth to Josie?\u201d\n\nI snapped out of it quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me?\u201d I kicked the dirt again. \u201cI thought Rowan was our camp leader.\u201d\n\nHarry lifted his head after a moment, his eyes flicking to me. \u201cYou know he can\u2019t make rash decisions right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d I said. \u201cWe both know he\u2019s not back to his normal self. He\u2019s both right now. A little kid, and a teenager.\u201d I shuddered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, did I forget to mention our so-called head counsellor was playing with a human eye like a fucking cat?\u201d\n\n\u201cMm.\"\n\n\u201cWell, why aren\u2019t you taking it seriously?\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s gaze skated the horizon, cotton candy colored clouds blurring into twilight. \u201cBecauuuse the sun is going to your head.\u201d\n\nI could practically hear his eyes rolling. Harry took three strides towards the wall and pressed his face into rough brick. \u201cSo, this is it, right?\u201d He muffled into rough cement. \u201cWe are really going to die at fucking summer camp.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to die,\u201d I corrected him. \u201cThey want you two and Carmel because apparently you\u2019re special.\u201d\n\nHarry made a scoffing noise into the wall. I was starting to think he was setting up camp there, planning to tell all of his grievances to the cement. \u201cOh yeah, because that\u2019s a good thing? You\u2019ve seen\u2014no\u2014heard what they\u2019ve done to Teddy and the others, and you think them wanting us for something else is special?\u201d his voice broke a little. \u201cI\u2019d rather have your fate.\u201d\n\nThe boy\u2019s words made me realize how little I was compared to the others. While they and Carmel were part of some grand, psychotic scheme, I was just needed for extra bulk. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk to your friends?\u201d I said, after letting the boy throw several punches into the soil. I wasn\u2019t going to comment on his hits being surprisingly strong enough to shake the ground. \n\nHarry didn\u2019t look at me after calming down, resorting to tracing the earth with the toes of his shoe. \u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\"The CIA.\"\n\nI was surprised by his retort, even if it was equally sarcastic. \u201cOh, you think I\u2019m in the CIA?\u201d He stepped closer to me, his breath in my face. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, this is bigger than the CIA. Whoever is in charge of this project is way higher up.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re admitting you\u2019re a sleeper.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what?\u201d I demanded, cutting him off. \u201cWhy are your fingerprints quite literally all over this?\u201d\n\nHarry folded his arms, his expression darkening. \"You're still talking about this?\" He groaned. \u201cJosie.\u201d He planted his hands on my shoulders. \u201cI am not a spy, okay? Yes, my writing being on those documents was weird, but we\u2019re also dealing with animal crackers which turn us into littles.\u201d His lips curved into the slightest of smirks. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it would be easy for a group of scientists to use my writing as some kind of red herring. They\u2019re trying to turn us against each other, obviously. And that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d He squeezed my shoulders and I felt momentary comfort. I was so tired. \n\nI hadn\u2019t slept properly in days in fear of Eleanor coming to smoke us out\u2014and the urge to just sink into the boy\u2019s chest was suddenly overwhelming. Luckily, I had self-control. I took a step back, and he dropped his arms. \u201cThat's sobering, yes,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I\u2019m still going to try waking you up with those trigger phrases we found.\u201d \n\nWhen he tried to speak, I shook my head. \n\n\u201cLike it or not, you\u2019re our only way out.\u201d\n\nI had made it clear several times to the two of them that I had no intention to use the trigger phrases we found taped to the back of the door in the bunker, when searching for more intel. But the more I was really thinking about it, if there were sleeper agents capable of taking down a group of forty-year-old tweens, I had no choice but to at least try. Because it was either that, or I gave the littles what they wanted. The boy\u2019s. Whatever they needed, Rowan, Carmel, and Harry were the keys to their plan. \n\nWe needed a miracle, and those trigger phrases were our best shot. \n\nHarry, of course, was against this idea.\n\nHe did that thing he always did when he scrunched up his nose and curled his lip. It reminded me of a toddler not getting their way. I saw it exclusively when the littles were taking advantage of his piggybacking service. \u201cJosie, I\u2019m not a fucking spy!\u201d\n\n\"You could be.\" I said stiffly. \"And until we figure out what is going on with you, I don't trust you. You said it yourself. Your writing was all over the kid's files, so at some point, regardless of you remembering or not, you have been part of this project.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, why did you bring me out here?\u201d He inclined his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me and yet you bring me on your little mission to find an exit.\u201d\n\nI shrugged. \u201cI was partly hoping we would be attacked and your natural instincts would kick in.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m your lab-rat?\u201d\n\n\u201cPartially.\u201d\n\nHarry did the scrunchy-nose thing again. \u201cWhat the fuck, dude?!\u201d\n\nHe looked like he was going to argue before deciding against it. Instead, he slipped on his raybans and gestured behind me with a sigh.\n\n\"We should probably get going before those little freaks come looking for us and realize we\u2019ve left our safehouse.\u201d I didn\u2019t know how to explain and put into words that to survive we had to try everything\u2014and if there was a slither of a chance that Harry really was some kind of sleeper agent, I was going to take advantage of that. I hadn\u2019t forgotten about Carmel, Callan, and Olive. Rowan too, no matter how screwed up he was. I was counting on getting all of us out. I turned on my heel and started to head back to camp. I didn\u2019t look at him because doing that would make me weak. \n\n\u201cRight. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nThere was something going at the camp when we got back. I was startled by an intense blue light illuminating from the lunch cabin, and I had half a mind to turn and run. Then the screams started. Just like Teddy, they sounded both human and not, a horrifying mix of man and machine wailing for death. I found myself paralysed, crouched behind Cassie\u2019s cabin, their phantom screams rattling my skull sending my thoughts into overdrive. \u201cJosie.\u201d I felt warm fingers wrap around my elbow and pull me back. Harry was thankfully there, dragging me away before I could expose us. It was enough to snap me out of it. Enough to drive me into fight or flight. \n\nWhen we made it back to Allison\u2019s cabin, Rowan was sleeping. He had conked out halfway through a pack of gummy worms. I spent the next few hours going through each trigger phrase written on the yellow sticky note we found taped to the door. I figured if we were going to try and wake Harry up, he would have to be restrained in case he was triggered to hurt us or even himself.  \u201cIs this really necessary?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d I said, squinting at the third trigger phrase. The two of us were sitting cross-legged in front of each other. Harry, breathing heavily, and me, trying to make myself calm. Harry pulled gingerly at the jump-rope restraints we had managed to loop around his wrists. I was expecting something out of him, but all I got were his wide eyes staring back at me. \n\nThe latest phrase was twisting my brain. It sounded like a kid\u2019s book.  I took a deep breath. \n\n\u201cGreen Tigers Do Not Live Independently.\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t move, making a deal of blinking rapidly back at me. \u201cNo, I mean,\u201d he gestured to his arms pinned behind his back. \u201cWhy did you have to make them so tight?\"\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re a spy, dude.\u201d Rowan had woken up, intrigued by my attempts to wake up a possible sleeper. He was pretending to go through the Eleanor Summers footage again, but the boy was clearly invested in what we were doing. Sitting slumped in the spinning chair, he leaned his fist on his chin. There were various things about Rowan I wanted to point out, but I was too scared to. The tips of his fingers were still stained red, and I had no idea if it was new or old. Rowan Atlas used to be the one guy at camp I used to think looked older than he was\u2014and acted older than he was. \n\nInstead of taking part in camp activities, he chose to sit on a branch and read pretentious classics. Yeah. He was one of THOSE guys. The slight stubble on his chin would definitely get him served alcohol, and his intelligence and quick-thinking would easily sway you if you were sceptical. Now he was the complete opposite. Maybe I was imagining things, but he had definitely gotten younger in the face, even if it was just a year or two. \n\nI am not talking about his appearance, however. Rowan\u2019s mentality was drastically different from the guy who held crisis meetings and ordered all of us around like we were his own children. This guy had a certain childish twinkle in his eye when I happened to catch it, a twitch in his lips which was constantly a wide smile like he was constantly seeing butterflies. Before being force-fed animal crackers, the guy had maintained his hair and hygiene no matter what happened. Now, he looked like he\u2019d been dragged through a forest. Literally. There was still grass and leaves caught in his sandy hair, his camp Redwood shirt torn in odd places. \n\nHe yawned, curling up on the chair, apparently getting comfy. \u201cNo hard feelings, but we gotta keep you under investigation. Like Josie said, your name was all over those shady documents.\u201d\n\nEven his voice was different. I couldn\u2019t call it a squeak, but it was close enough to one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a spy,\u201d Harry grumbled, ducking his head. \u201cI think I would know if I was\u2014what, some kind of government agent?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the whole point of them,\u201d Rowan, still with lingering childish traits, winked at him. \u201cThey don\u2019t know either.\u201d He raised his hand and mimed the finger guns, protruding them into his temples and pretending to pull the trigger. Adapting a storytelling tone, he lowered his voice to a whisper. Like he was talking to the kids. \n\n\u201cThey can live their whole lives without realizing.\u201d I could tell from his tone he was getting excited with the idea of sleeper agents. Maybe it was a kid thing. Rowan sat up straight with wide eyes. \u201cCruelly brainwashed by a secret organisation at a young age and turned into super soldiers, these guys have no family. No friends.\u201d His gaze flicked to Harry, his lips twitching into a teasing grin. \u201cOnly the insatiable urge to kill and follow orders. They don\u2019t have brains to feel or emotions. And that?\u201d \n\nHe did a dramatic spin on the chair. I could tell he was revelling in the look of horror on Harry\u2019s face. \u201cThat is the most dangerous thing about them. The inability to have free will. Because what happens when they come face to face with people they used to love? People from their old life?\u201d\n\nWith both of us enthralled in his speech, the boy smirked. \u201cThey kill them. Family members and friends. With one simple order? BAM.\u201d Harry jumped, and I am ashamed to say I did too. Rowan blew his imaginary finger guns. \u201cWith one single and yet perfect headshot, it\u2019s allll over. There\u2019s blood EVERYWHERE. There\u2019s brains!\u201d He giggled. \u201cBrains! And it\u2019s like, sooo gross.\u201d\n\nWith the way he kept adding to his story, getting progressively more excited and practically vibrating in the chair, the boy was reminding me more and more of my little sister. Which terrified me. Because if this was him back to himself, was this his new normal?\n\n\u201cRowan, stop.\u201d It took every ounce of my being not to yell at him. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like a fucking child.\u201d I was frowning at a sign on the wall warning us to \u2018mind our head\u2019. It wasn\u2019t even a low ceiling, and yet that was the fourth time I had seen that sign.\n\nHarry looked mildly horrified. Usually, he was the one who told the ghost stories. I could tell even he was questioning his own identity at that moment, and I paused interrogating him with phrases. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but who out of us ate our weight in animal crackers?\u201d\n\n\u201cAgainst my will.\u201d Rowan yawned again, doing another spin on the chair. I had to turn around and shoot him a glare. \u201cThat\u2019s the second time you\u2019ve thrown me being turned into a kid in my face. Which is not fair. Did I ask to be stuffed full of poison?\"\n\n\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t exactly fight against Eleanor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was tied up, asshole\u2014and I\u2019m pretty you were in la-la land at that point.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m allergic to peanut butter, so no,\u201d Harry rolled his eyes. \u201cI snapped out of it when my body reminded me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds like a you problem, dude.\u201d\n\nHarry groaned, tipping his head back. \u201cHoly shit, Rowan. You used to be cool and now you\u2019re like an annoying little brother.\u201d\n\n\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up. Both of you.\u201d I found my voice, grabbing a pen and scribbling out the first line of trigger phrases which were a no-go.\n\n\u201cRowan, annoyingly, is right.\u201d I said, ignoring the guy\u2019s noise of glee. If he kept spinning around on that chair, I was going to kill him. \n\nThe blur of movement at the corner of my eye was driving me mad. Focusing on Harry, I took a break from the trigger phrases for a moment, poking him in the cheek. It was supposed to be light-hearted, but the guy looked offended. \n\n\u201cFor the third time, we can\u2019t ignore that at some point you have signed off on all of those files, which means you were part of Spearhead.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you are, but we have to be smart if we\u2019re going to survive against a group of deranged scientists.\u201d\n\nRowan chuckled. \u201cWhat she saiiiiiid.\u201d\n\n\"Why aren't we paying attention to the guy who clearly has allegiance to those freaks?\u201d Harry stuck out his tongue at Rowan, which was surprising on multiple levels. Wasn\u2019t he supposed to be the normal one? \u201cAren't you their favorite counselor?\"\n\n\"I was literally mind controlled by preservatives, asshole,\" Rowan shot back. \"And I'm not the only one. You and Carmel are on their radar too.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but we\u2019re not the ones playing with eyes.\u201d\n\n\"I'm too tired to argue with you.\" The boy responded in a yawn, cuddling into the chair armrest like a cat.  \u201cAlso\u2026 you\u2019re a noodlehead.\u201d\n\n\u201cIgnore him.\u201d I told Harry. \u201cJust focus on me, alright? You have to look at me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to make the donuts.\u201d I articulated it perfectly.\n\nHarry surprised me with a laugh. \u201cThat one can\u2019t be real.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is. Shush.\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cThe strawberry moon will rise in July.\u201d When nothing happened, I frowned. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m not saying them right.\u201d I peered at the next one, mentally speaking it and then muttering it to myself to get an idea of the tone.\n\n\u201cOr,\u201d Harry shrugged, pulling at his restraints. \u201cI\u2019m just spit-balling here, but maybe I\u2019m NOT a secret government sleeper agent after all?\u201d\n\n\u201cBe mindful of the deep ravine.\u201d This time I practically shouted it in his face, only to get his wide smile in return.\n\n \u201cJosie, this isn\u2019t working.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will.\u201d I was growing increasingly more frustrated. \u201cJust try and listen to them, okay? Don\u2019t push them out.\u201d\n\nI tried one more time, leaning close and scrunching up the sticky note in my hand. Harry\u2019s expression stayed stoic, though from the contortions in his forehead and the twitch in his lips he was trying so hard not to laugh. \u201cIt looks like it will rain tonight.\u201d\n\nI was surprised, then, when Rowan jolted in the chair suddenly. He lifted his head, his eyes wide. I was seeing him back to his usual self for the flicker of a second, his expression contorted with fright, lips curling into a scowl. \u201cDo you guys smell that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSmell what?\u201d I sniffed the air, but there was nothing which was out of the ordinary. I had grown used to the combined stink of our body odour.\n\nRowan wrinkled his nose. He sat up straighter. \u201cThat.\u201d He whispered. \u201cIt smells like\u2026 burning.\u201d\n\nI opened my mouth to ask what he meant before Harry went stiff suddenly. I sensed his entire body seem to brace itself. His eyes hardened. \u201cUntie me.\u201d He said in a croak. \n\nWhen my shaking hands went to the boy\u2019s restraints, his were balled into  fists. I glimpsed muscles bulging through the back of his shirt and forearms. His demeanour reminded me of an animal growing territorial.  \u201cSomething is\u2026 wrong,\u201d he said in a sharp breath. Harry\u2019s frightened eyes found mine. \u201cWrong.\u201d He said again, blinking rapidly. \u201cSomething is...wr\u2013wrong. \u201d When I pulled the last of the rope from his arms, Rowan shocked me with a piercing cry which sent him tumbling off of the chair, his trembling hands planted over his ears, lips carved into an O. \n\nHis eyes were wide with terror, with agony I couldn't understand. Childish terror. Which catapulted him back to his real age. \n\nBefore I could hesitate, I was crawling over to him, attempting to snap the boy out of it. But he was inconsolable, his eyes almost unseeing, his body contorting with every shriek. It took me a moment to realize Harry was the same. But instead of a piercing shriek of a scream, he was wailing into his knees, as if to escape something. \n\nHis body seemed to jolt left and right, like he was being electrocuted. When I saw glimpses of sharp red pooling between his fingers and down the back of his neck, something sickly crept up my throat. Rowan was somehow worse, his whole face contorting like it was it's own separate being, rivulets of intense red dripping from his nose and mouth, and staining his hands desperately pressed over his ears. \n\nIt was a synchronised cry, I realized, after concluding that no matter what I did, I couldn't save them. \n\nIt was a sound only they could hear, a high-pitched screech like a dog-whistle which was only affecting them. It was the kids, I thought. Surely. If they could disembowel counselors, I was sure they would have no problem engineering a sound which would only affect certain people. \n\nStumbling back, I had two choices. I could either try and help them, try and block out this phantom noise slowly killing them-- or I could leave them and find a safer place. With that choice in my mind, I barely noticed the phone begin to ring under Allison's desk. \n\nThat same old fashioned trilling rang in my head, and I managed to reach under and grab the receiver, my heart in my throat. \"Please.\" I managed to squeak out, trying to ignore Harry, who was trying to rip out his hair, his eyes rolling into the back of his head. I saw the whites, blood vessels popping one by one. \n\nWhen he crumpled to the ground, I thought he was dead. But his wails continued into the floor, and I wanted them to stop. I wanted him to die because I couldn\u2019t stand hearing him screaming for help which wasn\u2019t coming. I couldn't help them, and it was killing me. The kids were clearly trying to smoke us out, this time targeting the boy\u2019s. Still though, I had my secret weapon. The Spearhead project. \n\n\"There are three of us left,\" I panted down the phone. \"You have to help us. I am at Camp Redwood. You need to get us out of here. Do you hear me? You need to get us out\u2013\"\n\n\u201cAttempts to fix the current situation have been unsuccessful, Miss Greenfield,\" the woman with the British accent's voice came through in a rush of static, cutting me off. Her voice was monotone, and I wondered if she was in fact a programmed bot.  \n\n\"All efforts for manual activation have failed from the disaster zone. The signal appears to have been sabotaged. I repeat. The E.485 frequency has been sabotaged. Designated models 0115, 0116, and 0118 are now officiated as being faulty and are no longer needed for protocol 9AXC5. Please stand by for standard protocol deactivation.  Thank you for your service. Agent Salta. Agent Elsilrac. Agent Lemrac.\u201d\n\nMy grip loosened on the phone, and I felt my legs started to give-way. \"You're the one doing this to them?\u201d\n\nWhen Rowan dropped to his knees, blood dripping from his nose, my stomach jumped into my throat. There was no way. I figured it was an attack from the kids, but I was wrong. Instead, this sound, this frequency, was coming from the phone.\n\nI thought back to the video footage. Agent Lemrac interviewing Eleanor Summers. Harry's signature on the paperwork. \u201cCan you\u2026 say that again?\u201d I heard myself say in a breath. But the dead ringing tone was already clanging in my skull, a robotic countdown laced within the static. I grabbed the pen I had been writing with, scribbling those names down, my hands shaking.\n\n\u201cPreparing emergency shutdown protocol. Thank you for your service, Agent Salta, Elsilrac, Lemrac.\u201d The voice continued, which was just another stab in the gut. I heard Salta before. I heard Lemrac. But writing them down, I realized what they meant.\n\nSalta.\n\nElsilrac.\n\nLemrac.\n\nI was a fucking idiot. No wonder the littles wanted them and Carmel\u2014 why they were so important to their plan. Slowly, I could feel myself start to crumble. The phone slipped from my clammy hands, but I could still hear the woman beginning an emergency shut down. \n\nI didn\u2019t feel the impact when my knees hit the ground, but I did start to sense something twisted and sour tickling the back of my nose and throat. By the time I had noticed it, it was already choking the bunker. But somehow, I didn\u2019t care about the stars in my eyes or my own blood being projected onto my hands with every wet sounding cough exploding from my lungs. I could still hear their names, and every time I said each of them, more and more of me shattered.\n\nAtlas.\n\nCarlisle.\n\nCarmel.\n\n\u201c18\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c17\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c16\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c15\u2026\u201d\n\nLaying on my back while my head spun, I was partially aware the boy\u2019s screaming had cut off. \n\nInstead, they were just sitting there, eyes wide and unseeing, the blankest I had ever seen them. There was so much blood running down their faces, and I imagined something rooted inside of them tearing their minds apart from the inside. Letting out another strangled cough, which was definitely biological warfare courtesy of the kids (not enough to kill, but definitely a warning not to fuck with them) my gaze flicked across the bunker, taking everything in. The paperwork we had been going through. The chair Rowan had been spinning around on. The ropes Harry\u2019s arms had been entangled in. I was frowning at the walls, and then the ceiling. \n\n**\u201cPlease mind your head when you step down the stairs.\u201d**\n\nDrinking in the words slowly, my cotton candy thoughts imploding into one blurry mess. \n\nBut then I was a little more awake, this time turning my gaze to the wall where the same sign had been taped to the wall. **Please mind your head when you step down the stairs.** And\u2026 there it was again, taped to the desk, and underneath the laptop. Hidden in plain sight. It had been there all along, and yet I only realised when I wasn't thinking about it, when my mind was being suffocated. Something seemed to snap inside of me, and I sat up, driven by pure adrenaline. With one hand pressed over my mouth and nose, I forced myself into a sitting position and dragged myself to Harry, whose head was lolled at an unnatural angle, his eyes closed. \n\nPart of me wanted to smash up the phone, knowing what these bastards had done to their sleeper agents now they were no longer usable. The boy almost resembled a doll. Was this the so-called sleeper which had been planted inside Redwood? Empty eyes, empty everything. He was like a shell with a human face. No better than Eleanor's experiments.\n\nWhen I grabbed hold of his arms, I had to hold him steady, his body cut from these puppet strings which had held him. \u201cHarry.\u201d I could barely speak, my voice more of a croak. I knew he was awake and aware, but a singeing, almost burning smell was coming from directly inside his head as blood ran from his nostrils in shades of red and pink. Now I knew what the burning was when I pressed my face against his and sucked in a lungful of poisoned air. It was him. He was a defect being set alight from the inside. \u201cYou need to look at me, okay?\u201d \n\nWhen he didn\u2019t, instead crumbling in my arms, I struggled to hold him upright. Twisting my head to Rowan, he seemed in a better state\u2014kind of. At least he was still sitting straight. \n\nMy last words were barely audible. \u201cPlease mind your head when you step down the\u2014\u201d no sooner had the words left my mouth before the sounds of footsteps coming from above, the unmistakable murmur of giggling getting closer and closer. Harry dropped to the ground like he had been severed from his puppet strings. \n\nI wasn\u2019t aware when I slipped to the floor, whatever had filled my lungs finally taking its toll. Through flickering eyes, I could see our barricade being blown through, the ground rumbling beneath me, throwing me into something warm.\n\nRowan.\n\nHis body was curled up against the wall, haemorrhaging from the ears. \n\nIt was only when I was truly taking in the stink curling in the back of my nose and throat as Eleanor Summer\u2019s mechanical grin popped out of nowhere, when I realized I had smelled it before. I had choked on it before. The circle of kids looming above me let out a shrill squeak of, \u201cFound you!\u201d while I found the dark, and beyond that, a memory I thought was a dream.\n\nFirelight flickered in the backs of my eyelids. The blur of orange and shadowy smoke was mesmerising. I stared real hard at the fire like I was told to, at smouldering shades of yellow and orange colliding, thick black smoke billowing into the air while our faces illuminated the circle. I tightened my grip on my beer, swallowing another mouthful. It was cheap shit, but had just enough burn to get me tipsy. I felt good at that moment. Relaxed. \n\nMy head was starting to spin, but it was the good spinning, like I was going round and around on a carousel. I wasn't sure why I felt apprehension at the moment. \n\nIt was just a game, right? So, why did I want to jump up and go home? Why did I want to squeeze my eyes shut? Milo's words rattled in my skull as I squinted into the fire. \"Come forth, those who are no longer with us.\" Ghosts weren't real, I thought dizzily. They couldn't be. \n\nNot when science and logic existed. However, when the flames began to grow increasingly more erratic, I couldn't resist leaning forward, and... there. Something warm crept its way up my throat. \n\nThere was a shadow twisted in the smoke, a very human-like thing stepping directly from the trees, from the hollowed darkness I had been too scared to fully take in-- finding solace in flickering and illuminated sparks spitting from the fire. The others started to murmur to each other as the thing took a step out of the trees. Clea shuffled back with a cry, and Milo and JJ turned twin shades of sickly pale. It was a guy. \n\nOlder, by maybe a year. Shaggy reddish hair tied into a loose ponytail. His clothes were a simple leather jacket and jeans, but looking at his face, he was bruised, every part of him exhausted and battered. His eyes, when I caught them, were nothing but twin pools of oblivion glaring back at us.\n\n\"Holy fuck.\" Milo hissed out. \u201cI didn't think that would actually work!\" Downing his beer, he whooped. \"Alright! Name, age, occupation, and...\"\n\nHis lips quirked into a grin. \"How you died, man!\u201d\n\nThe guy inclined his head, his mouth curling into the start of an amused smile. \"I'm not a ghost, Jackass.\"\n\nHis British accent was jarring.\n\n\"And?\" Milo leaned back, crossing his legs. \"Play along, bro. Or I call the cops and tell 'em a grown ass man is fucking with some minors.\"\n\n\"But he looks our age,\" Clea hummed. \"And he's kinda cute.\"\n\n\"I don't give a fuck,\" Milo's eyes were hard. \"State your truth, or I get my dad on the line.\"\n\nThe guy rolled his eyes, raising both arms like he was surrendering. \"Samuel Joseph Wilder,\" he surprised me by responding. Now that I looked at him, this guy definitely was not dead. Unless dead people carried a gun latched to their belt, and a cheap iPhone sticking from their jeans pocket. \"Nineteen years old.\" He shrugged. \"I guess you could say I'm an ex-student.\"\n\nHe paused, and I caught emotion flicker across his face, his hands balling into fists. \"I was killed\u2013 no, murdered, by my town.\"\n\nMilo leaned back, cracking open another beer and taking a sip. Clea leaned closer to him, her eyes wide. \u201cPlaying along, huh? I like it. State your truth.\"\n\nThe guy nodded, lowering his arms. His dark eyes flicked to each of us, drinking all of us in. \u201cI just escaped from a secret government facility doubling as a summer camp which has converted half of my town\u2019s kids into mindless super soldiers.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause, before Clea burst into nervous giggles. Milo cocked his head. \u201cI said state your truth, not plagiarise The Hunger Games.\u201d\n\nIgnoring Milo, the guy turned his eyes to me. \"Josie Greenfield?\" He took a step forward before seemingly deciding against it. I didn't move or speak, my heart in my throat. I didn't have to reply. This strange boy continued, his lips curling. \"You're going to die tonight, Josie.\" \n\nAt that moment, I realized why I had been feeling nauseous all night. Why my mind had been anticipating something all day, and why, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't brush off his words. Maybe part of me was expecting this. \n\nThe stranger's tone was too cold to ignore, the state of him too real to brush off as a joke. \n\nSuddenly, it was just me, him, and fate itself glaring down on us, my life as I knew it exploding into nothing in the charred remains of the dying fire. \n\nHis voice echoed in my head, collapsing into white noise, when I noticed how truly inhuman he looked. I fully took him in, illuminated in firelight. \"If you don't get the fuck out of this town, you are going to have the same fate as me.\"\n\n\u2026\n\nI\u2019m going to go out on a whim and say it\u2019s\u2026 not 2018 and I\u2019ve been at Camp Redwood for way longer than I realized?",

    "postText": "Well then\u2026 here we are.\n\nI have to be honest; when I posted the first of these logs from my bedroom in North London, I didn\u2019t think it would go very far. After all, why would it? I wasn\u2019t a regular contributor to this site, nor a seasoned veteran of the paranormal. I was just a man who missed his friend, seeking a few words of wisdom from an online message board, open to the idea that it wouldn\u2019t lead anywhere.\n \nSuffice to say I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong.\n\nOver the past two months, the incredible advice I\u2019ve received from this forum, and the amazing leads you\u2019ve sent my way, have opened up entire worlds of possibility. It\u2019s thanks to all of you that I\u2019m where I am now; sitting in a rental car on a quiet street in Phoenix, Arizona, posting the last of Alice\u2019s records.\n \nI realise I\u2019ve written more than usual for my part. Apologies for this. If you want to skip straight to Alice\u2019s section, that\u2019s fine.\n \nOtherwise, please consider this the prologue to the epilogue.\n \nIt\u2019s very, very early in the morning over here, with only the gravest of the graveyard shift out on the streets. By all rights I should be in bed, and not wasting petrol on an aimless drive through the city. The ritual helps me think however, and I\u2019d recently been given a lot to think about, courtesy of a young woman at a local bar.\n \nShe was a forum member, who\u2019d contacted me over Direct Message. When we met up earlier in the night, it was clear she\u2019d done a great deal of research; charting every mirror shop in Phoenix in an attempt to reconstruct the route Alice took on February 7th 2017.\n \nWe spoke for quite a while; about the game, about Alice, and about life in general. Once closing time rolled around, she handed me a printout of the most likely route, with all the key locations circled. Then, in the final minutes before we parted ways, she nervously asked me two questions. The first put me in a rather sour mood.  The second provided the fuel for my 3am drive.\n \nQuestion One; Are you sure she wants you to find her?\n \nI\u2019ve been hearing the same query from a few of you recently, especially since Part 9 was posted. People commenting that Alice made a clear choice when she left Rob behind in the silent city. That I was searching for someone who wasn\u2019t seeking return.\n \nI\u2019d like to take a moment to respond to this, as I responded to it earlier tonight. To be clear, the Alice I know wouldn't do that. She was planning to come back, she\u2019d told us as much. I\u2019m not going to waste your time with my theories, but we\u2019ve seen what the road can do to people's minds, how it can carry them away against their better judgement. I understand why it's being asked but if those sorts of questions are all you have to offer, I\u2019d kindly ask you find another way to help.\n \nQuestion Two was less clear cut; what are you going to do now?\n \nIt\u2019s something you guys have also been asking me, but that was the first time I\u2019d heard the question out loud. In the awkward silence that followed it became obvious to her, and in some ways to me, that I didn\u2019t yet have an answer.\n \nI decided to take a drive while I figured it out\u2026 I\u2019ve been in my car for the rest of the night,\n \nAfter an hour of aimless meandering, I realised I was close to one of the marked locations; the alleyway where Alice first entered the underpass, the point at which she first disappeared into the road. Turning into the side street, just after a large intersection, I was briefly relieved to see no sign of the tunnel. The part of me that still hoped this game was a fiction swelled at the sudden lack of evidence. My reaction was short lived of course, as I quickly realised that the tunnel wouldn't have shown itself to me anyway. Even if the game were real, I\u2019d hardly been sticking to the rules on my way here.\n \nThere was no denying that the place resembled Alice\u2019s descriptions however, and with a long time to go until I\u2019d feel remotely tired, I decided to work my way back along the route, retracing Alice\u2019s steps towards Rob Guthard\u2019s street.\n \nOK so I have to admit at this point, I suffered from a momentary lapse in intelligence. In a fog of distraction, residual jetlag and general dullardry, I drove for longer than I\u2019d care to admit under the misconception that I *wasn\u2019t* playing the game. I thought this because I was heading in the opposite direction, and had started my run with a right hand turn, when the rules explicitly state that you begin by turning left. Of course, as I\u2019m sure all of you would have realised immediately, that didn\u2019t mean I was out of the game, it just meant I started playing with my first left turn, one road later.\n \nAlice was always the smart one.\n \nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that, due to this fairly mindless oversight, I wasn\u2019t exactly looking out for the Woman in Grey as I drove past what should have been her corner. There wasn\u2019t a mirror shop this time of course, that\u2019s only the 34th turn when you\u2019re coming the other way, in fact I\u2019m not sure which of the many passing streets it was. It is strange though, as I think back through my journey, I feel like I would have noticed her. The streets were practically deserted, so much so that any pedestrians stood out immediately. I know I should\u2019ve been looking more closely but, if you asked my honest opinion\u2026 I don't think she was there at all.\n \nThe moment I realised this, I felt it again; the faint perverse, hope that I\u2019d been misled, that the entire story was nothing more than a twisted, elaborate fabrication.\n \nIt wasn\u2019t long until I passed an old mirror shop and, 34 turns later, arrived on what must have been Alice\u2019s starting street. It was an inner-city neighbourhood whose residents were all fast asleep. From the moment I realised that the game was in play, I\u2019d been thinking less and less about this particular road, and more about the one directly after it, resting just beyond the crossroads. I\u2019d come halfway across the world on the strength of Alice\u2019s account, but I\u2019d seen no first hand proof of the Left/Right Game. If the whole thing was a hoax, then the next road should just be another street. If it was real, then I\u2019d know soon enough.\n \nI crawled up to the junction with my heart in my throat. With every inch of road that passed under my tyres, I found myself hoping more and more that it wouldn\u2019t be true. Let someone be playing a prank on me, let the logs be counterfeit... let Alice be anywhere else but on that road.\n \nI took the corner in a wide arc, parking myself in the centre of the crossroads, my headlights facing down the next turn.\n \nAhead of me was a quiet residential street; lines of neatly parked cars, rows of well-kept yards and squarely drawn windows. Yet at its centre, in utter defiance of the modest surroundings, the road sank into a deep and dimly lit corridor, cutting beneath the street, and disappearing into complete darkness.\n \nI\u2019d always known it was true.\n \nIn the presence of grim confirmation, the question I was asked earlier that night started to ring in my ears, as if echoing out of the tunnel itself. After an entire night\u2019s driving, after two full months of searching, I still didn\u2019t have a response.\n \nIn the end I just left the engine running, as if turning it off would somehow be a sign of retreat, and decided to type up the notes you\u2019re reading now. I thought maybe the process of putting it all down on paper would bring me clarity, and leave me with either a note of farewell or a note of apology to Alice, for not having what it took to find her.\n \nAnd now\u2026 here I am; still undecided, still writing, still sitting in this rental car on a quiet street in Phoenix, Arizona.\n \nThough perhaps the street\u2019s not as quiet as I thought.\n \nI\u2019ve just looked back to the previous road, down the street where Alice began her journey. As I type this very paragraph, I can see a figure standing on the sidewalk, just outside one of the houses. It isn\u2019t the woman in grey this time.\n \nThough it\u2019s almost too dark to make out, I can tell the figure is an older male, well built and imposing, the rugged features of his weathered face half lit by moonlight. I\u2019ve never seen this person before, yet he bears a striking resemblance to another man; a man whose description has been well recorded within the pages of Alice\u2019s logs.\n\nHe watches me in silence, staring through the window of my still running car.\n\nI wonder if he can help.\n \n[Part 1](https://redd.it/7asz8x)\n \n[Part 2](https://redd.it/7bkk41)\n \n[Part 3](https://redd.it/7cf4h8)\n \n[Part 4](https://redd.it/7dmuvp)\n \n[Part 5](https://redd.it/7fdu9c)\n \n[Part 6](https://redd.it/7h9jzb)\n \n[Part 7](https://redd.it/7jabqd)\n \n[Part 8](https://redd.it/7loh1l)\n \n[Part 9](https://redd.it/7q3x6e)\n \n*****\n \nThe Left/Right Game [DRAFT 1] 20/02/2017\n \nThe Left/Right Game was once nothing more than a 9-page document, peeking out of a yellow envelope, resting quietly on my desk.\n \nI remember reading it on my lunch break.\n \nI remember it made me laugh.\n \nThe submission had arrived with the first post, quietly making its way around the office, treated by everyone as a short-lived novelty of little journalistic value. The story was easy to dismiss, appearing all too similar to the rambling ghost stories and blurry UFO sightings that filled our mailbox on a daily basis, and which most of the senior staff had learned to instinctively ignore. Doomed by association, the document was quickly passed over, my desk merely a pit stop on its way to the rejection pile.\n \nI was curious however and, after an uneventful few months in my new role, I had no compunctions about fishing from the scrap heap. Placing the envelope in my satchel, alongside a misfit crowd of similar rejects, I slipped away to a local coffee shop, reading it in an armchair by the window.\n \nSomewhere around page three, between the description of the game\u2019s rules and the exhaustive list of \u201cRequired Skills\u201d, my mouth started to curl into an irrepressible smile.\n \nThey\u2019d been gloriously wrong about this one. It wasn\u2019t some paranoid diatribe, nor a sensationalist plea for attention. Within those pages lay an introductory glimpse of a man\u2019s passionate obsession. As I read on, something about his earnest eccentricity, incredible thoroughness, and unquestioning confidence made it impossible to put down. When I turned the final page, reading the last of Rob Guthard\u2019s charming and refreshingly well formatted submission, I knew that this was the story I wanted to tell.\n \nLater that day, I found myself in the editor\u2019s office making a case for it. They didn\u2019t quite see what I saw, but I was intent to win them over regardless. I told them the story would be characterful, colourful, thought-provoking and, at the very least, that I wouldn\u2019t be gone long.\n \nIt\u2019s been twelve days since then; ten since I first entered the Wrangler in Phoenix, Arizona, five since I commandeered it myself, leaving Rob behind in the silent city. I haven\u2019t updated much recently, save for a regular set of notes made for my own benefit. In all honesty, after I finished writing up my account of the city, I was struck by an overpowering sense of needlessness. There was no one left to receive these logs, no friends to proofread, no editor to hand them to. It seemed pointless to maintain the same prosaic format as before.\n \nI still largely agree with this assessment. It\u2019s only due to a set of exceptional circumstances that I\u2019ve chosen to type up the following account in full.\n \nWhoever this reaches, I want to thank you for reading up to now.\n \nI\u2019m quite sure this will be my final instalment.\n \n*****\n \nThe moon has broken, and in my entire life, I\u2019ve never witnessed an evening so still.\n \nThe air is cool and quiet, and the Wrangler cuts cleanly through it as I glide down a stretch of even tarmac. The scene is defined by calm and absence. Not a cloud in the sky, not a solitary whisper of breeze, not a single blade of grass stirring on the dark green banks beside me.\n \nYet even on a night as peaceful as this, I can\u2019t help but feel far away from home. The city had served as a turning point in that regard. Before we reached those titanic monoliths, the landscapes we passed through generally resembled the world I once knew. A few obvious exceptions aside, there was nothing about the environments that looked truly divorced from reality. That\u2019s all changed now. The aberrant aspects of this new world are unignorable, constantly hanging at the corner of my eye, passively injecting a sense of wonder and disconcertion into the otherwise silent night.\n \nA few days ago the moon started to crack like old porcelain. I hardly noticed at first, my eyes fixed on the road as it loomed above me, quietly splintering into three jagged pieces. As of tonight, the empty space between each fragment has significantly increased. If I focus on the sky for a little while, I can almost see them falling away from each other, charting infinite and lonesome trajectories through a barren cosmos, against a backdrop of foreign constellations.\n \nThe stars themselves fall further than they should. The night sky travels down past the horizon and continues below it, wrapping underneath the grassy bank. It\u2019s as if the road, and the narrow plains on either side, are suspended in the middle of a vast abyss; a platform in the middle of open space.\n \nAt least that\u2019s what I thought it was at first. It didn\u2019t take long before I noticed the broken moon was appearing twice in the sky, both above and below me. A pair of orbiting satellites; identical and in perfect alignment. That\u2019s when I realised that there were no stars below me. I was merely staring across a flat surface so flawlessly mirror-like as to cast a perfect reflection of the heavens above.\n \nI was driving through the centre of a lake.\n \nThe water is impossibly still. Since leaving the shoreline proper yesterday night, I\u2019ve seen neither a wave, nor a ripple across its placid surface. It\u2019s also undeniably vast, reaching beyond the horizon in every direction and continuing further still. Without being sure how I know, I\u2019m aware that the waters carry on for an unspeakable distance, that I would sooner reach the stars themselves before setting foot on its opposite shore.\n \nI lean over and switch gears. The act of driving the Wrangler was a daunting one at first, but after the first two days I\u2019ve managed to make do. An old scarf wrapped tightly around the steering wheel serves as a makeshift handle, allowing me to navigate corners one handed. I don\u2019t have an elegant solution for the gearshift, but I\u2019ve quickly grown used to the process. If I\u2019ve learned anything from the road, it\u2019s that grace is the first casualty in the fight for survival. Adaptability, no matter how clumsy, outlasts it at every turn.\n \nA few minutes later, the Wrangler pulls up to a spacious verge. A large circle of land surrounded entirely by dark waters. At the far end, the grass seems to fall away, dropping sharply into the lake with a dead stop. The road continues of course, but it's the only thing that does. With nothing on either side, it forms a narrow bridge of perfectly flat asphalt, raised on a bed of mud and rock.  \n \nI press my boot onto the brake pedal, easing the Wrangler to a steady halt at the centre of the clearing. For the first time today, I open the car door and climb out of my seat. The dull tap of asphalt shifts to a soft rustling as I make my way over to the lakeside.\n \nThere\u2019s something on the shore, a barely discernible object, almost entirely concealed by a shock of verdant undergrowth. It\u2019s a miracle I\u2019d managed to spy it from the road, though perhaps something about the stark uniformity of the landscape had made it stand out. \n\nAs I advance towards the water, and the object draws near, its indeterminate form solidifies in my mind.\n \nIt\u2019s a human arm, reaching out from the water and onto the bank. I crouch down to examine the few pertinent details. The fingers are still embedded firmly into the soil. The thumbnail is broken, coloured by a peeling coat of faded varnish. There\u2019s a pallid, emaciated quality to the skin, spreading down the arm until it disappears beneath a thick, woollen sleeve. At the point it meets the surface, the water soaks into the fabric, turning it black from the original grey.\n \nWith a sad exhalation, I rise to my feet and lean over the water\u2019s edge.\n \nThe body of Marjorie Guthard lies against the silt, her cheek resting on the lake bed, her wide bewildered eyes staring out into the open lake. She\u2019s been almost perfectly preserved. Save for the striking tautness of her skin and its mottled, grey pallor, she looks exactly like the woman I saw on the 34th turn, who\u2019d tried to repel me from the road, who\u2019d spoken of a lake drinking her wounds clean.\n \nIt seems her ramblings weren\u2019t completely void of fact. It\u2019s clear to see that Marjorie has been exsanguinated, so completely in fact that the only evidence that blood ever flowed through her veins, is a large dark stain across her shredded blouse.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take long before the perpetrator makes itself known.\n \nAs I stare into the water, a steady stream of formless whispers sink up through the depths of the lake. The softly spoken murmurings drift up to my ears, taking root in the back of my mind and instantly blooming into a flurry of deeply persuasive promises.\n \nI find myself entirely transfixed by the still water, as a myriad of generous offerings unfold in throughout my consciousness. The whispers suggest an end to the phantom pains in my absent arm, perhaps even a completely restored limb, stronger than it had been before. Furthermore, it shows me a glimpse of its incomprehensible span, its furthest bank reaching across countless worlds, its deepest point lying below everything. I\u2019m offered total knowledge of every league, every fathom, every inconceivable shore.\n \nMy hand reaches down as the whispers continue, every bargain steeped in sweet beneficence. A moment later, my outstretched fingers brush against the soft grass, and wrap around Marjorie\u2019s exposed arm.\n \nDigging my heels into the ground, I lean myself backwards and pull. The water ripples and splashes as I drag Marjorie\u2019s lifeless body slowly onto the bank. I feel the voices in my mind grow louder, erupting in anger as I back away from the lake.\n \nThe promises had been convincing, each quiet solicitation undeniably persuasive. But after seeing Marjorie\u2019s wretched fate and the look of eternal betrayal in her vacant eyes, I found myself aware of a subtle undercurrent behind every syllable, a sense of desperation and timeless hunger emanating from beneath the lake\u2019s surface. I already have a clear understanding of what would have happened if I\u2019d lost myself to those waters. I suspect it\u2019s no coincidence, that of the countless shores it showed me, all of them appeared to be deserted.\n\nMarjorie wouldn\u2019t have stood a chance. She\u2019d left the forest alone, grievously wounded and without a vehicle. She\u2019d walked the whole way here, bleeding endlessly, the road\u2019s rejuvenating power battling every moment against her body\u2019s natural inclination to die. I suspect the road\u2019s influence wasn\u2019t strong enough, and when a whispering voice promised, ever so sweetly to mend her, she would have been in no position to refuse. \n \nHer other sleeve brushes against dry land, her body leaving the water for the first time in decades. I keep pulling until my boots hit asphalt, laying her down on the grass just beside the Wrangler.\n\nAfter a moment of sober vigil, I walk to the back of the car and fetch Rob\u2019s foldable spade.\n \nA long few hours follow. I\u2019ve never dug someone\u2019s grave before, and my injury is hardly conducive to the task. My fleece tied around my waist, pearls of sweat running down my brow, I manage to slowly chip away at the damp earth. Five hours later, my back cramping, my hand raw from gripping the shovel, I attempt to lower Marjorie into the rough pit with some semblance of grace, her legs dropping limply into the soft soil despite my best efforts.\n\nIt takes over an hour to shovel the soil back. It\u2019s a sobering and ugly task. As a layer of dirt covers her face, I realise this will be the last time a living person lays their eyes on Marjorie Guthard. Burying her suddenly feels disrespectful, as if it\u2019s an act I don\u2019t have the right to perform. \n\nOnce it\u2019s done, I drop onto my knees, a dull ache in my muscles as I smooth out the disturbed ground with the back of the shovel.\n\n**MARJORIE:** You.\n\nEven before I turn to face her, I can hear a scowl in her voice. There\u2019s an odious depth to that one acrid syllable, a potent witch\u2019s brew of contempt and accusation that feels like it\u2019s been festering in her drowned lungs for decades.\n\nReluctantly, I rise to my feet and turn around, finding myself face to face with the woman I just buried. She looks different now, her clothes are dry, her skin clear, with nothing to be seen of the deep, dark gash in her blouse.\n\n**AS:** Marjorie.\n\nUnlike the empty vessel below us, the woman in front of me is by no means at peace. She shakes and wretches with the same indignant fury I witnessed when we first met. When she speaks, her words shudder under the weight of her own turbulent emotions.\n\n**MARJORIE:**  I chased you. I ran to you. I\u2026 I gave him up for you.\n\n**AS:** I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry Marjorie, I don\u2019t know what you mean. Tell me what you mean.\n\n**MARJOIRE** The things I saw, things so beautiful. And I saw her, walking alone through the new worlds. I gave everything up for you!!\n\nI don\u2019t know quite what to say. It\u2019s pointless to ask her what she means, to try and understand her frenetic ramblings. In the end, I can only try to speak her language.\n\n**AS:** Marjorie I\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean you to.\n\nMarjorie\u2019s trembling breaths burst into a despairing fit of laughter.\n\n**MARJORIE:** Oh\u2026 oh yes you did. Yes you did. And now\u2026 now you\u2019re here.\n\nMarjorie\u2019s wild and volatile demeanour shifts once more, her laughter degrading further into a desperate crying panic.\n\n**MARJORIE:** And what do I do now? What- What do I do?!\n\nMarjorie cringes with the terror of the self-imposed question, placing her head in her hands and repeating it over and over again. As I watch her wrestle with despair, I\u2019m struck by an idea I\u2019ve never before considered. The disconcerting notion that, in death, we are not transported to a set destination by some ethereal attendant. That in fact, nothing is decided for us. Perhaps the manner in which we spend our afterlife is down to us, a decision we have to make ourselves.\n\nMarjorie is standing over her own lifeless body, still lost, still entirely unmoored. \n\nThere's no sign of boundless paradise, inescapable damnation or everlasting nothingness, and the common thread they share, a final release from the weight of our own agency, is similarly absent. Perhaps we never get that freedom, perhaps we continue like we always do, accompanied by all our imperfections, uncertainty and discontent. \n\nPerhaps we must choose our eternity.\n\nAfter all my time on the road, that\u2019s possibly the most terrifying notion I\u2019ve encountered. \n\n**AS:** He never stopped looking you know.\n\nMarjorie snaps out of her wretched despair, instantly aware of who I\u2019m referring to, staring up at me with an expression I\u2019ve never seen her wear before. \n\n**AS:** I saw him, walking on the road. He didn\u2019t stop. He was never going to stop. I think he was looking for you Marjorie, he still is. \n\nMarjorie stares through me. For the first time since we met on that quiet Phoenician corner, I can see the faint spark of something other than misery and rage across her tear stained face.\n\nI hold her gaze for a moment more, before pulling my phone from my pocket. In a single sweep of my contacts, I delete every number except for one. A number I pulled from the Nokia during our second night on the road. A number that connects to a lost wanderer of the road.\n\n**AS:** I don\u2019t know if this can help but\u2026 stranger things have happened.\n\nAs she stares up into my eyes, I feel like we\u2019re finally meeting for the first time. Without a word, Marjorie reaches out a quivering hand and takes the phone from my outstretched fingers. \n\nBefore I can say anything more, Marjorie Guthard is gone.\n\nA few moments later, a refreshing breeze lands against my cheek, a soft zephyr, cooling my still warm face. It\u2019s a welcome sensation, and the first movement I\u2019ve witnessed in the air since I set out onto the lake. Wiping the sweat from my forehead, I stare quietly along the bridge, the breeze picking up around me.\n\nIt\u2019s a subtle wind at first, brushing stray hairs across my forehead, chilling the perspiration on my neck. Yet as I reach my hand out, and feel the air slip between my fingers, I\u2019m witness to a steady rise in both strength and magnitude.\n\nThe sound of the wind grows from a whisper to a howl, Seconds later, the hanging sleeves of my fleece begin to stream sideways. My hair lifts from my back, billowing in the throes of a developing gale. \n\nI back up against the Wrangler\u2019s hood as the air finally erupts into a roaring, cacophonous cyclone. My hand reflexively seeks the sturdy frame of the Wrangler, my fingers wrapping around the grille, my arm tensing as the unrelenting wind threatens to drag me from the road.\n\nSquinting through the violent tempest, I focus on a single point in space, just above the threshold of the bridge.  In the midst of the storm, a jagged line of white hot light bursts out of the ether, tearing through the night\u2019s fabric, a crackling fissure that widens and yawns, forcing apart the curtains of reality as they frenetically struggle to recombine. \n\nStaring through the shuddering fracture, I\u2019m subjected to the briefest glimpse of a boundless, and impossible vista. It is a faraway place in both distance and time. An achingly beautiful and gloriously terrifying dreamscape, enduring on the majestic shores of infinity. Every moment there spans a millennium and unfolds in countless directions at once. Every passing shadow holds a darkness beyond measure, their edges burned by the glare of a waking sun which looks across every conceivable world with a hollow, rancorous intent.\n\nIn the midst of this maddening landscape, a singular entity approaches, gliding towards the portal with the clear intent to pass through. As it breaches the shuddering gateway, and the wind dies down around it, I stare up at its grand celestial form.\n\nThe being is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen; composed entirely from electric arcs of brilliant, magnesic light which burst from a volatile and blinding central core. It sounds like a lightning storm, its plasmatic tendrils snapping and crackling, bursting chaotically through the night air before collapsing in on themselves. As they fall back into the creature\u2019s centre, they emit pale clouds of vaporous fractals that fade softly into the air.\n \nSomehow, even as my eyes barely adjust to the stark light, I realise that the entity usually burns much brighter. It's dampened its glow for my benefit, so that it can appear before me without scorching my eyes from their sockets.\n\n**AS:** It\u2019s you\u2026 isn\u2019t it. You\u2019re the voice I\u2019ve been hearing. You\u2019re the one who brought me here.\n \nThe bristling maelstrom of light hangs in the air, crackling and shifting, its transient limbs strobing with chaotic incandescence. Part of me wants to hide, part of me wants to run, but neither are an option anymore. Releasing my hand from the Wrangler\u2019s grille I take a single step forward, standing on my own and staring up into the entity\u2019s smouldering core.\n\n**AS:** Can I get an interview?\n\nThe creature doesn\u2019t react. In the following silence, I feel it observing me. When it finally responds, its voice ruptures the night, echoing through my skull.\n\n**VOICE:** There is little time, but you may ask what questions you have.\n\nEach reverberating syllable forms a string of literal shockwaves in the surrounding lake, emanating outwards from the being in a perfect circle. I watch the waves roll into the distance, showing no sign of ever diminishing, and I think about what question to ask first.\n\nIn the end, it comes to me quickly; a promise is a promise after all.\n\n**AS:** What happened to Marjorie? Why did she do what she did?\n\nThe being pauses, as if considering its response. When it does reply, it speaks with a calm sobriety.\n\n**VOICE:** She glimpsed an echo of the future, dreamed of the road, of the things that it passes through.\n\n**AS:** Like whatever\u2019s through there?\n\nI gesture through the gateway, which is now almost entirely blocked from view by the creature\u2019s spiralling form.\n\n**VOICE:** She dreamed of untold frontiers. She saw a lone woman walking them. Over time, the fulfilment of that vision became everything to her.\n \n**AS:** But it wasn\u2019t her\u2026 she thought she was seeing her own future\u2026 but it was-\n \n**VOICE:** It was you.\n\nThose three words, as they burst into the open air, casting three narrow waves across the boundless water, hit me with a deep and heavy force. Unbeknownst to myself, decades before I was even born, Marjorie had been driven insane by dreams of maddening grandeur, of a life of boundless possibility and true significance. She had given everything up to chase a shadow\u2026 a shadow that eventually turned out to be mine.\n\nI hadn\u2019t just pulled Rob into this game, I was the reason for everything. I was the cause for the tragedy that befell his entire family, \n \n**AS:** She didn\u2019t just dream those sights. You influenced her. You let her see them\u2026 the same way you made Rob see me in Aokigahara. You pushed and you prodded wherever you needed so that I\u2019d end up here. Are you the reason Bobby got the rules in the first place?\n \n**VOICE:** Yes.\n \n**AS:** But\u2026 why? You toyed with so many lives across\u2026 across decades. Why me? Why does it matter that I travel the road?\n \n**VOICE:** Because across all humanity, across every conceivable permutation, you are the one who makes it the furthest.\n \nIt speaks plainly, as if the statement were a foregone conclusion. Yet its words strike me into silence.\n\nThe creature continues.\n\n**VOICE:** I\u2019ve watched you work your way here, through skill and through tenacity\u2026 and undeniably through luck. You were brought here because of these qualities, and they will carry you further along the road than any other.\n \n**AS:** Then why didn\u2019t you just bring me here? All that influence and you didn\u2019t lift a finger\u2026 after everything that happened-\n \n**VOICE:** Events transpired as they needed to.\n \n**AS:** As they\u2026 needed to?! People died! Marjorie. Bobby. Ace. Apollo. Eve. Lilith. Everyone. They\u2019re all gone. Do you not care at all?\n\nIn response to my words, the entity remains silent for longer than usual.\n \n**VOICE:** I care more than you know. There are things greater than your understanding, forces that exist beyond the realms of your comprehension that you would consider a threat to everything you hold dear. My actions were guided by a higher standard of knowledge. Your protests are predicated on false understanding.\n \n**AS:** You\u2019re saying I don\u2019t understand death?\n \n**VOICE:** You don\u2019t.\n \n**AS:** ... That still doesn\u2019t make it right.\n \n**VOICE:** Regardless, my influence is necessary. That which is necessary must be.\n\n**AS:** What even are you?\n \n**VOICE::** I cannot answer that question in any way you\u2019d understand.\n \n**AS:** That's not good enough.\n\nThe creature doesn\u2019t respond, as if it doesn\u2019t feel it needs to. So far it\u2019s returned my every argument with impenetrable certainty. From the domain it occupies, knowing what it knows, my arguments must seem entirely facile. Even if it did feel the need to justify itself, after seeing the place it hails from, I wonder if there\u2019s any way I could ever comprehend its motives.\n\nStill, that doesn\u2019t mean my arguments are invalid, and the creature\u2019s lofty dispassion does little more than stoke my desire to oppose it.\n\n**AS:** And what if I don\u2019t want any part of this?\n\n**VOICE:** You are travelling the aberrant strand; a singularly stable flaw in the fabric of reality. As it carries you further from the world you know, you will be freed from the influence of the old laws. You have already noticed the effects in those who settled the road, those who were lost to it and in yourself; energy without consumption, knowledge without requisite experience. You are shedding entropy, and causality and in time you will reach realms of understanding you cannot currently fathom. You will find answers to questions you never thought to ask. You will discover absolute truth. For this reason, you will carry on.\n\n**AS:** That\u2019s the only reason?\n\n**VOICE:** Do you need another?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t come across as a question, but rather another blunt statement of fact. I understand the effect it\u2019s speaking of. Ever since the city, I\u2019ve been encountering vague notions and fragmented ideas that occur to me randomly and without announcement. New avenues of thought leading to revelations that would otherwise lie beyond my mortal reach.\n\nI\u2019ve started to comprehend things I could barely have conceived of back home, and though the onset of these notions had been terrifying at first, they grow less so with every passing day.\n\n**AS:** No\u2026 no, I don\u2019t trust you. I don\u2019t-\n\n**VOICE:** Your trust is immaterial. You will travel the road regardless.\n\nThe creature\u2019s already stark glow starts to intensify.\n \n**VOICE:** I\u2019ve watched you, on every turn \u2026 across every moment of your journey.\n\nOne of the creature\u2019s countless protrusions lashes out at the empty air, forming another harsh, glowing fissure. It wrenches itself open in a few stilted jolts, a transparent, almost crystalline membrane stretched across the gap. Through it, I can see myself, in the centre of a cornfield, examining a block of C4 explosive.\n\nIt\u2019s as if I\u2019m staring into the past through a jagged shard of one-way glass.\n\n**VOICE:** I\u2019ve watched you questioning.\n\nThough we can\u2019t be seen through the aperture, I see the glasslike membrane shake with the force of the creature\u2019s voice. As the window collapses, I can see the rows of corn thrown into a frenzy.\n\nA second arc lashes out at the sky, forming a second aperture. This time I\u2019m expecting the sight before me. I see myself, crying in the forest\u2026 a silent radio by my side.\n\n**VOICE:** I\u2019ve watched you struggle.\n\nThe second window closes. The creature has made its point.\n\n**VOICE:** I\u2019ve watched you fight\u2026 to make your way here.\n\n**VOICE:** You will not turn around. \n\n**AS:** You make it sound like I don\u2019t have a choice.\n \n**VOICE:** You do have a choice Alice, but you have already made it.\n\nAs much as I\u2019ve grown to detest the creature\u2019s presumption, in that moment, I know it\u2019s right.\n\nWhat it\u2019s saying is true. I\u2019ve done things I never would have imagined in order to get where I am now. In fact, if this being hadn\u2019t arrived at all, I\u2019d already be heading out over the bridge. \n\nI\u2019m not proud of what drives me; that same, ugly impulse that led me to refuse Rob\u2019s offer of return, that made it so easy to leave him behind in the silent city. But there\u2019s no denying the impulse is there. It\u2019s been with me the whole time, long before I ever arrived in Phoenix, Arizona\u2026 and it\u2019s buried deeper than I\u2019ve ever wanted to admit.\n\n**AS:** Can I\u2026 do I get to say goodbye?\n \nThe entity says nothing. It hangs in the air, flickering and coursing with rupturing bolts of light. The next thing I hear is a faint mechanical hum emanating from the Wrangler behind me. Turning around, I pace briskly back to the car, opening the door and reaching into the passenger seat. My notebook is booting up, seemingly of its own accord.\n \nPicking up the laptop, I lift the lid as I march back towards the bridge. I stare up at the silent being before me. When I look down to the laptop, my email client is already displayed on the screen.\n \n**AS:** How\u2026 how long do I have?\n\n**VOICE:** Long enough.\n \nThe entity begins to regress, its arcs diminishing as the being at its core turns away. Its message has been delivered. There is nothing more to discuss. \n\nAs it passes through the gateway, into an unknowable world far removed from my own, I call out after it.\n \n**AS:** I\u2019m still not certain I trust you.\n \nThe being focusses on me once more, as the fracture begins to close. A final set of waves pass across the surface of the lake as it solemnly replies. \n \n**VOICE:** \u2026 I remember.\n \nA moment later, the being is gone.\n \nI stand motionless in the middle of the road, the entity\u2019s final remarks washing over me, its curious choice of words echoing in my head. In the renewed silence, the faint stirrings of an overwhelming and terrible revelation start to form in my mind.\n\nIt could have simply said that it knew of my mistrust, that it heard the overtones in my voice, saw the disdain across my face or otherwise sensed it in the space between us. Instead, the being spoke as if my current feelings were a memory, dwelling somewhere within its depths.\n\nIt was undeniable that my time on the road was changing me, but in all this time I\u2019d never truly considered how those changes might evolve as my journey continues. \n\nI\u2019d never thought about what I might gain, what I might lose\u2026 or about what I might inevitably become.\n\nA short while passes before I lower my eyes from the empty space above the bridge, to the screen of my notebook. Lowering myself down, I cross my legs and rest my back against the Wrangler.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been reading from the beginning, you\u2019ve finally caught up with me.\n\nI hope you\u2019ll allow me a few personal messages.\n\nTo Rob. I hope you\u2019re able to read this someday, and I am so, so sorry for everything I\u2019ve done; for everything I may do. I hope you understand that I didn\u2019t know, and that none of this was your fault. You did the best you could, and the days I spent with you were the most significant of my life. It was an honour to know you and I hope that, among these pages, you find the answers, and the peace, that you deserve.\n\nTo my mum and dad, I\u2019m sorry I won\u2019t be sending this to you. In the end, I was carried along this road by a profound selfishness, and I just can\u2019t bring myself to face you. I can\u2019t imagine the pain I\u2019ll be putting you through, and I won't try to justify my actions. All I can say is that I love you and I\u2019m sorry that my last act towards you was one of cowardice.\n\nAnd finally to you; the person to whom this message will be addressed. I\u2019m sorry. I always thought I\u2019d see you again someday, that the roads I took would eventually lead me home. That doesn\u2019t look so likely now. Though I could say a lot to you, I\u2019m not going to.\n\nBut I wish we could have been friends for longer.\n\nIt feels like a lifetime since I first arrived at Rob Guthard\u2019s quiet street. I remember the uncertainty as I waited for him to open his door, with no concievable idea what was about to transpire. \n\nLike so many other things, that\u2019s now changed. Despite being in an entirely new world, further from home than anyone\u2019s ever been, I know exactly what\u2019s going to happen next.\n\nI\u2019m going to take a drive. Take a left, then the next possible road on the right, then the next possible left. I will repeat the process ad infinitum, until I wind up somewhere new. \n\nAnd from there I\u2019ll keep driving, beyond worlds, beyond time, beyond the bounds of my imagining. To a place where the lake runs dry, where the broken moon drifts away, and the stars disappear in the rear view.\n\nTo a place where everything has fallen away, and the road is all there is.",

I guess perhaps he could realize that Alice is basically on the path to no longer really being Alice anymore, that she's not coming back, and after cleaning things up with Rob, he could just come back..\n\nOr maybe Alice/weird entity Alice needs OP following her?  \nOr maybe the whole point of the road is that it recursively draws people in.\n\n\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

Alice avoided this fate ONLY because Marjorie's body was there. Immediately after she avoids that grim fate, a being appears out of thin air to justify everything she has been through and tell her she is predestined to continue down the road. Not only that, it makes a vague promise about finding truth, which is Alice's core motivation in life. How. Bloody. Convenient. \"She knew it was right\" mhm. Just like Marjorie knew she had to play the game? Just like she knew the lake would help her? Alice is right not to trust the smug alien bastard- it's just another weapon in the road's arsenal. Because the road is alive and it feeds on those that travel it. Wouldn't it be wonderful if Alice WAS the being and everything made perfect sense and all was well with the universe? Since when has it ever been that easy.. OP, if you're reading this, find her. If you're very lucky... you might just be able to save her before it's too late. And whatever you do- don't trust anyone on the road. ",

And now her role has been played, she lost all she had, even her life, and she is stuck alone in a  horrid dreamscape for the rest for eternity. \"And what do I do now?\" Even when/if Bobby and her manage to find one another, I can't see much hope.

But the idea of actually \"going in\" may also further motivate NeonTempo to go in.  It's like the difference between knowing that skydiving is real, and skydiving.   \n\nIf he saw Rob there at the tunnel opening that he found, then, if Rob is willing, he might take a trip \"just to see.\"\n\nIf I were Rob and was going to go in again, I'd want something on the order of an APC or tank, to make it through Jubilation.",

It could be that Alice has gone far enough to become this entity, but there is something or somewhere only OP can reach. \n\nAnd since it has shown itself to be so manipulative, can we really be 100% sure that it didn't say \"I remember\" just to lead Alice to the conclusion that it was her? It wasn't a subtle hint at *all* - at that point saying it 'remembers' Alice's feelings towards it alongwith telling her she will go the farthest across all timelines and multiverse can only hint that it is what Alice will become. It lead Marjorie to the road by showing Marjorie a future that she thought was hers but turned out to be Alice's, who can tell if the same thing isn't happening to Alice? How do we know it isn't leading Alice away so OP will chase her? \n\n",

He mentions it a few times (wanted London to be her call sign, is a little surprised when he\u2019s reminded on the road that she\u2019s not from London, etc). So Rob definitely has Alice and London linked in his mind.  \n\nThe only other time London is mentioned in the story, it\u2019s in regards to OP living there with Alice.  And OPs name or gender is never mentioned, but this last entry implies that Alice and OP could have been more than friends. That doesn\u2019t mean that OP is a guy of course, but it\u2019s something. \n\nThen again, Rob mailed his notes to Alice\u2019s office, which was probably in London. That could also be why he thinks she\u2019s from there. \n\n\nEdit:  OP does say he\u2019s a he in Part 1:  \u201cA meandering waster trying to stay off his parent's farm\u201d\n\nIn Part 9, Rob says (in reference to Bobby):  \u201che coulda run the farm at 15 but, country life didn\u2019t take\u201d\n\nThanks to u/DreamTimeDeathCat for pointing that out.

For example, she didn\u2019t tell the audience that she kept the C4 from Bobby\u2019s car (until she blew up Bluejay). So it\u2019s possible that she simply changed the names in her story. \n\nOr, Rob intentionally gives a fake name. I did some googling as found a website that gives meanings for names. It\u2019s nothing fancy, but it\u2019s the second or third link in a google search, so it\u2019s possible someone used it to search for meaningful names. [Check out these listings for Guthard](http://www.meaningslike.com/name-stands-for/guthard). \n\nEdit:  especially meaning 3.  So on the nose it\u2019s suspect lol",

And Rob never showed signs of being so socially tone deaf at other times.  For example, he avoids pressing Bonne and Clyde about what\u2019s bothering them after they tell him Bonnie has Alzheimer\u2019s. He doesn\u2019t want to overstep any bounds by pressing the matter, or by telling the group.  But for some reason, he thought it was ok to go into a sleeping stranger\u2019s room and hang out on her bed while she eats.  That\u2019s notably weird, unless Rob already knows her.  \n",

Is that thread from 2016 somewhere to be found? \nBecause I know for a fact that I haven't read this story before. But the left and right game seemed so similar. Like I had heard of it before. But even more than that. Like I had experienced it. \nWhen I was reading the first few parts it was just there like a shadow. A small thought that I might have seen that original thread somewhere, and since I read a lot of nosleep and listen to horror podcasts I thought that might be it.\n\nBut then a few parts in, when Bonnie started talking about Wintery Bay, something jolted inside me. As soon as I heard the name I knew I had been there. I know the streets, I know the mountain next to it. I know the water. \n\nBut most of all I know that I had a fight there. It is a memory. Like deja vu, but rather like it was in a dream. I was in Wintery bay. There was around five people around me and I was screaming to one of them. She had a yellow coat. I do not remember what I was screaming about nor do I remember what happened after that, just that I was scared and cold. \n\n This could be something I have read on the original thread because the memory is so distant, it could also be a dream. All I know is that Wintery bay sound like someplace I would like to visit if the road takes me there.  ",

It may be a total bust.\n\nYesterday evening, browsing through my encyclopedia of saints, I noticed St. Julian the Hospitaler (\"The Poor Man.\")  Most of the information on Julian comes from *The Golden Legend,* a 13th-14th century text that contains a lot of \"traditional\" (and perhaps not remotely factual) information.  He killed his parents by mistake.  The Pope told him (accompanied by Julian's wife) to go open a hostel in an inhospitable place.  They did, and addition to doing that Julian became a ferryman.  They served many people and they were eventually killed in just the same way as Julian had mistakenly killed his parents.  Then the miracles started, and he became a saint (but not her.  Quite).\n\nTheir favorite people: *ferrymen*, *pilgrims*, *travelers*, *the childless,* *murderers*, those who are hospitable, jugglers, clowns carnival workers and circus people.\nIcons/attributes: *stags,* oars, and swords.\nFeast days:  January 29, *Feb 12*.\n\nI  hope St. Julian blesses any decision u/NeonTempo makes about what to do next.  And if Rob and/or Alice are still alive at the end of this thing, may St. Julian bless and watch over them.\n\n[EDIT 1]  Not through yet, but: Lake, check.  Bridge, check.  Marjorie, check.  Feral baby = Marjorie's baby, check.\nSo much beauty and so much awefull weirdness.  And this:\n &gt;I\u2019m struck by an idea I\u2019ve never before considered. The disconcerting notion that, in death, we are not transported to a set destination by some ethereal attendant. That in fact, nothing is decided for us. Perhaps the manner in which we spend our afterlife is down to us, a decision we have to make ourselves.\n\nI've never seen/felt that articulated that way before.  Awesome, awesome, awesome.\n\n[EDIT 2] St. Julian shows up in no explicit way, but the sentiments for blessings stand.\n\nMoore boxes checked.  THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM LEFT FOR PART II!!!\n\nTo the redditor who expressed misgivings about possible \"deus ex machina\" wrap-ups:  That's kind of what we got, but I personally feel quite satisfied by what we got.\n\nHats off to all the smart redditors who figured out the foreshadowings and got so much of this stuff right.  Y'all are might clever!  And thanks again to u/NeonTempo for delivering such an evocative and original story.",

Still, going the weird benevolent alien route left me wanting more. This chapter was not as exciting, perhaps by design, and it left many questions unanswered, such as what happened to Rob?

She transcends this - becomes God, if you will, to some degree omniscient and able to affect our world. It's a bit like that time loop where you are your own grandfather, so it is necessary that you must go back in time to impregnate your grandmother. (That's from something but I'm not sure what, and tabbing to Google is hard.)\n\nThe journey that leads to Alice's transcendence is implied, not told, but clearly she continues to survive until she reaches the state the entity is at. There's implications too that, since the entity can observe and interact with Alice at any time, that there are discrete instances along this world's Timeline that can be interacted with repeatedly.\n\nThe road itself probably called to those certain people who would put Alice in the circumstances in which she is now, since her experience was shaped by those around her. Her destiny is to become God - why, I don't think is revealed. But not likely to pass her legacy on to anyone else, since the loop has completed - the Alice of our world's time has started her journey there. OP seems to only have wanted to confirm that this was true, that Alice really was gone.",

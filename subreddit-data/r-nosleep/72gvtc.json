    "postText": "One of my least favorite parts about being a middle school history teacher is the bullshit \u201cLiving History\u201d assignments we give at the end of every school year. Kids are supposed to sit with their grandparents and video tape, voice record, or transcribe their oldest memories for posterity (and for an easy way to bring up their GPA).\n\nI have been doing this for seventeen years, and when I collected the projects this time around, I assumed they would be as dull, if not duller than usual. This had not been a particularly bright class.\n\nSo I went home, poured myself a glass of wine, and prepared for a long night of \u201cI only owned two pairs of pants when I was your age\u201d and \u201cMy brother got beat with a newspaper for hitting a baseball into a neighbor\u2019s yard.\u201d And of course, these projects were peppered with innocent, old-person comments that were so horribly sexist and racist you just had to laugh. \n\nNow, I had a girl in my class whom I will call Olivia. She was pudgy, quiet, and proved herself a consistent B student. I expected her project to be as unremarkable as her, and perhaps that\u2019s why I was so profoundly disturbed by what I witnessed that night.\n\nOlivia had submitted two discs for some reason, so I began with the one marked \u201cinterview.\u201d My screen hiccupped twice before a grainy image of a living room came into view. The place was a hoarder\u2019s hell. Olivia was curled up in an armchair clutching a notebook and looking like a scared animal. Across from her sat a man with a somber countenance, smoking a cigarette and staring at her expectantly.\n\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d a woman\u2019s voice whispered from behind the camera. Olivia\u2019s owlish eyes flashed towards the screen, then back to the man.\n\n\u201cI am here with my Great Uncle Stephen,\u201d she began almost inaudibly. \u201cHe is going to tell us about his oldest memories from being in the army.\u201d\n\nGreat Uncle Stephen looked like he\u2019d rather be in a goddamn trench at the moment, but he waited patiently for the questions to begin.\n\nNot surprisingly, Olivia read verbatim from the suggested questions sheet I had handed out to the students. He answered her curtly. Once or twice I heard her mother whisper \u201cspeak up, Olivia\u201d from behind the camera. Typical, boring shit.\n\nSo I was intrigued when Olivia set down the notebook and asked, \u201cDid you like being in the army?\u201d \n\nThat was totally off-script. Great Uncle Stephen emitted a chain smoker\u2019s wheeze. \u201cNope. Glad to get out of my town though.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d\n\n\u201cBalkans.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d she said. I doubted she knew what the Balkans were, and my suspicion was confirmed when she asked, \u201cWas Baukiss very different from here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nMom cleared her throat from behind the camera, perhaps encouraging Great Uncle Stephen to be a little more forthcoming.\n\nBut Olivia seemed genuinely interested. \u201cUncle Stephen,\u201d she asked, \u201cwhat is your very worst memory from the army?\u201d\n\nThe old man crushed his cigarette in the ashtray and then slowly lifted himself out of his chair. \u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d he mumbled. The camera cut off.\n\nWhen the screen flashed back on, everything was the same except Great Uncle Stephen had several pieces of paper in plastic sleeves laid atop all the crap sitting on his coffee table. One, he held in his hand.\n\n\u201cI was a kid when I enlisted,\u201d he said, looking at Olivia. \u201cYour brother\u2019s age,\u201d he told her. Olivia nodded. \u201cI never saw combat. Both of my deployments were to cities in Eastern Europe that had been destroyed by civil wars. Everything was a mess. I felt like a janitor for fuck\u2019s sa-\u201d \n\n\u201cAhem!\u201d Mom coughed.\n\nGreat Uncle Stephen sighed and looked at his paper. \u201cMy unit was assigned to a school that had been obliterated by all the violence. Broken windows, caved in rooms \u2013 and for some reason, the part that got to me the most was that the school had been like this for years before we got there. No one had lifted a finger to fix it. I saw kids walk by it on their way to go beg for money or whatever shit they did-\u201d\n\nThe camera dipped towards the floor as I heard Mom whisper harshly at Great Uncle Stephen. I couldn\u2019t make out what she was saying, but it wasn\u2019t hard to imagine.\n\n\u201cDo you want to hear this goddamn story or not?\u201d I heard him bark in response. \u201cThen you better let me tell it how I want.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom,\u201d Olivia chimed. \u201cPlease stop interrupting.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you presenting this in front of the class?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Mom, we\u2019re just handing it in to the teacher.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s heard the word shit before,\u201d Great Uncle Stephen contributed helpfully. I wasn\u2019t a \u201che\u201d as a matter of fact, but other than that the statement was accurate.\n\nThe camera was lifted and after a couple of blurry focus adjustments, the shot was the same as before.\n\n\u201cAhh I\u2019m talking too much anyway,\u201d he grumbled. He lifted the piece of paper in his hand close to his face. \u201cIn the basement, I found this letter. I didn\u2019t know what it said but I had a buddy of mine translate it. So I\u2019m gonna read it now. And then I\u2019ll tell you what I saw in that basement.\u201d\n\nA chill ran down my spine. Mom zoomed in to Great Uncle Stephen and his letter. His palsied hands trembled as he held up the paper. This is what he read:\n\n\n\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI never loved my country. So many of these skirmishes are born from patriotism, a power struggle for the shards of a once-great empire, but I do not care what name my home has on a map. This fighting is senseless and I stay as far away from it as I can.\n\nIt was not these attacks and disorganized violence that took the lives of my wife and child. It was illness. Mercifully, it happened quickly for the baby. Nadja suffered for longer. I watched in horror knowing I could do nothing for them. My only solace is that I was there for them every step of the way. I stopped going to work one day, and no one came after me. I doubt they noticed I was gone. Since the school was simply across a field, visible from my window, it would have been easy to go for a few hours each day and come home quickly to care for them. But what was the point? All I did was clean floors. I was as useless to the world as I was to my family.\n\nI tried to take Nadja to the hospital, but the journey was too long and taxing. I brought her home and she died that night.\n\nAfter Nadja and the baby were gone\u2026 well, I don\u2019t remember much. I didn\u2019t leave my hovel, barely ate and slept, thought many times of taking my own life. Tempting though it was, I felt paralyzed by my own helplessness.\n\nThe one thing that kept me sane was my radio. I never turned it off once. Even though I didn\u2019t listen to the words being said \u2013 in fact, the channel I got the clearest was in English (I think) which I don\u2019t speak a lick of. But the voices, the music, and the true knowledge that life existed beyond this violent city sustained me.\n\nI have no idea how long passed before I saw the light of day again. I was dizzy from hunger, so finding food was my priority. My radio came with me, of course. Since I first holed myself up, it has gone everywhere with me. It talks to me as I sleep and as I wake. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s saying, but I know I would die without it.\n\nOnce I had some water and food, it occurred to me that the only thing left to do was go back to work. So I did. The following morning, I simply returned to the school where I was a janitor and got back to work. \n\nNobody made a big deal out of it. Like I said, Nadja had been sick for a long time, and those who worked at the school knew it. I appreciate that no one had pestered me to come back to work during the hardest days of my life. The teachers never said much to me, but we smiled at each other in the halls and that mutual respect was perhaps the reason I decided to come back at all.\n\nThe place had gone to the dogs without me, so I simply grabbed my broom and rags from my closet and set to cleaning. Everyone is grateful to have me back, I know. And the best part is that nobody minds my radio. I bring it with me everywhere and keep the volume low enough not to disrupt the students. No one has ever complained. In fact, I suspect they like it.\n\nThe schoolhouse is not very big, but does require a lot of maintenance. The floors are always sticky and stained, so I spend most of my time mopping. Kids make messes \u2013 I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m still in business. Sometimes I have to move things around to make sure I get every spot on the floor beautiful and clean, but I take pride in that.\n\nAnd the repairs! The school always needs tune-ups here and there, and I am happy to help. Some days I\u2019m reconstructing a desk that broke as I whistle along with the radio, other times I handle more serious, structural issues. Days when I have work like this, I feel truly instrumental, like a cog in a larger machine. How could this school survive without me? It took me a long time, but I once again feel that I have purpose.\n\nThere is a larder behind the school that is full of preserved food. In lieu of payment, I am allowed to take as much food as I need. That arrangement is fine \u2013 what would I do with money anyway? I used to bring the food back to my home, just one field away from the school, but when I started sleeping in the basement no one seemed to notice. This school is special to me and I cannot leave it unguarded.\n\nWhen I am besieged with memories of my wife and baby, I turn up the volume on the radio to drown out such thoughts. It works for me every time.\n\nExcept this morning.\n\nBecause this morning, I woke up to dead silence.\n\nI frantically examined the radio to see what had happened. I honestly cannot tell you how many days in a row I have been using it. Did it simply live out its life and die naturally? I have spent the entire day trying to fix it. Most of this time, I have been crying. I am losing my mind without it.\n\nI have given myself until sundown. If I cannot fix it by then, I am going to take my life. I am writing this because the sunlight is starting to die and I know what my fate shall be.\n\nI have thought about taking one last walk through the halls of my school, saying goodbye to the students and teachers. I know I will be missed. But I cannot bring myself to leave this room. I cannot go anywhere knowing that my radio is dead in here.\n\nThere are no more tears in me. It feels now like I can\u2019t catch my breath. I vomited what little food I had in my stomach and I am growing dizzy again, like I did after Nadja died. I am not long for this world.\n\nBut before I take my life, I have closed the door to this room and stuck a chair beneath the handle. It is the only room in the basement and has a small casement that lets in just enough light for me to see what I am doing. If anyone is kind enough to come looking for me, they should not be met with this gruesome sight. Perhaps they will see the door is blocked, smell my rotting body, and simply forget I ever existed.\n\nBut I have placed both my radio and this note outside the door. Kind sir, if you are reading this, I have one humble request: please fix it. Save my radio. It did not deserve to die in its sleep and I am ashamed that I cannot revive it.\n\nNow I am ready to join Nadja and little Ludmilla in heaven. I hope this school can find another janitor who loves and cares for it the way I do.\n\nThe hour is now. Do not forget my radio.\n\nStanislav\n\n\n\n\nWhen Mom zoomed back out, Olivia had tears in her eyes. \u201cThank you for sharing, Uncle Stephen,\u201d Mom said, her voice choked. \u201cI think we have enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d Olivia chirped. \u201cHe said there\u2019s more. What did you find?\u201d\n\nBefore Great Uncle Stephen could open his mouth, the image disappeared. My jaw dropped. Was that it? What did Great Uncle Stephen see?\n\nI promptly remembered that there was a second disc. This one was unmarked, but I hoped it contained the rest of the interview.\n\nThere was no video, only audio. The voice that started up was Olivia\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHi Miss Gerrity. I\u2019m sorry about my mom, but she refused to record the rest of what my uncle was saying. But I asked him to continue and secretly recorded the story as a voice memo on my phone. I remember you said earlier this year that history is written by the people who win wars.\u201d She sucked in a breath and commenced crying. \u201cBut everyone\u2019s history is important, even if they are sad, pathetic people and even if they never won a single thing in their life. I haven\u2019t slept through the night since I finished this project, but you have to hear what my uncle has to say.\u201d\n\nThere were tears in my eyes, too. The sincerity of her words was beautiful. I was also flattered that she had remembered some trite phrase I threw around because it was what my history teachers said to me. \n\nBefore I got too sappy over it, the audio began again.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d came Mom\u2019s frustrated voice. \u201cIf you want to hear the rest of the story, fine, but this is not appropriate for a school project.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me finish,\u201d Great Uncle Stephen snapped. \u201cIf it\u2019s too much for you, help yourself to a snack in the kitchen. But Olivia wants to know what happened.\u201d\n\nI heard her mother mumble something and walk away. Olivia and her uncle were alone. I imagined her looking at him expectantly. \n\n\u201cSo did you find the radio? Or did it get ruined when the school got blown up?\u201d\n\nHe rasped and I heard the distinct click of a lighter. \u201cThat letter,\u201d he began slowly, \u201chad a date on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat date?\u201d she inquired hungrily.\n\n\u201cIt was dated two weeks before we started rebuilding the school.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you say the school had been destroyed like two years ago?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Great Uncle Stephen. \u201cIt had been.\u201d\n\nThere was silence as I felt goosebumps on my arms. The images that came to my mind were almost too overwhelming to express, but Great Uncle Stephen put them into words effortlessly. Clearly he had spent his whole life thinking about it.\n\n\u201cThis man, this Stanislav, went to a vandalized, falling apart schoolhouse and cleaned up blood and rubble like it was spilled drinks and dust. He smiled at dead bodies in the hallway and believed they were smiling back at him because they liked his radio. He moved around corpses so he could sweep the ground under them. The roof was half collapsed, so when it rained, he must\u2019ve gotten soaking wet but was so oblivious that he didn\u2019t even feel a thing.\u201d I could hear Olivia crying steadily. \u201cI found the larder he was talking about. It was all pickled, preserved food that probably tasted like shit. Most of the stuff was moldy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid \u2013 did you see the dead body?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Hanging from the ceiling, but still amazingly\u2026 lifelike. He wasn\u2019t rotting away.  This hadn\u2019t happened years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he look peaceful?\u201d she asked, a chord of desperation in her voice.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t tell you. The smell was rank, and his face was blue and his eyes were bulging. Like this.\u201d I imagined him demonstrating. \n\n\u201cAnd the radio?\u201d Olivia wept.\n\nI heard Great Uncle Stephen take a long drag of his cigarette. \u201cIt was there, alright. And it was still on.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Not enough to form drops that rolled down my cheek but enough that I needed to rub them to clear my vision. This was a truly gutwrenching story. As a person that deals with mental illness quite often, and has witnessed dementia in my mother when she\u2019s off her meds &amp; sleep deprived and has an episode I am fully aware that someone can snap &amp; stop seeing reality. I have even been on the precipice of madness more than once, seeing demons and ripping them out of my body, seeing auras &amp; angels hearing &amp; smelling things that weren\u2019t really there. I\u2019m lucky enough that I can shake off the crazy by sheer force of will but I am afraid that that won\u2019t always be the case. That one day I will lose touch with reality &amp; begin hallucinating again but this time not being able to force myself to stop seeing the demons &amp; that this time I may not defeat them as easily.",

Also, I'd invite you to check out this book called The Science Of Compassion by some dude named Gregg.  It doesn't really help with the preventing insanity, but it made me feel a lot better about a lot in my life and that's been nice.  Anyway, best of luck!  And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes, I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.  Also, have you seen a mental health care professional, cuz they totally have anti-hallucination pills or so I've heard.  Peace!  ",

Maybe he just finished breaking, and gave up. \n\nBut I think it could well have been physiological. He was eating molded, pickled food, exposed to the elements and to the dead. Pneumonia gotten from repetitive exposure to the cold rains could cause hearing loss. He could have picked up an illness (or had what his wife and daughter had in a lesser strain) that took his hearing. ",

Right when he found some peace, even if delusional, it was broken and he died,  just like the radio. \n\n\n Listening to radios and tv as background noise can help somewhat with some mental illnesses by breaking through their repetitive or obsessive or intrusive or hallucinatory thoughts. \n\n\nI wish he had found someone to help him fix his radio. I bet the spirits and ghosts appreciated his efforts. Maybe a ghost could have left him instructions. He must have known on some level that nobody else was alive, so he had nobody to help him and didn't ask a science teacher etc. Very sad. ",

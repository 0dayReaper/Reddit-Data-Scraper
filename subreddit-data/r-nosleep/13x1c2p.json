    "postText": "\r  \n\r  \nIt all started last week\u2026\r  \n\r  \n\u201cGo brush your teeth and get ready for sleep\u201d, my mom said to us as she moved the wine in her cup in a circular motion while sitting on the couch with her legs crossed on the surface of the table.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYeah, go to sleep brats, your old men need some privacy\u201d, Eddie, my stepfather said from next to my mother.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat the hell you talking about? She\u2019s mine not yours, idiot!\u201d Paul yelled out from my mother\u2019s other side, knocking some booze out of his behemoth of a glass and onto the carpet. \r  \n\r  \nEvery day it was the same. These two clowns come to our house just to spend time with my mom. And by spending time I mean what I mean.\r  \n\r  \nMy mom is, as you can say, made to make even a fairy jealous. She has almost perfect skin with no flaws in her facial appearance at all. She is basically the next angel ready to ascend to heaven. Unfortunately, her nature, how she lives and her personality say otherwise.\r  \n\r  \nShe isn\u2019t even our mom, why am I even calling her that as I\u2019m writing this?\r  \n\r  \nMaybe I\u2019m being generous, maybe I\u2019m being foolish or maybe I\u2019m forgiving. Either way, she isn\u2019t the mother that tucks you in your bed every night. She isn\u2019t the mother that cares. Caring? Selfless? Generous? Those words don\u2019t fit right in her personality.\r  \n\r  \nShe\u2019s narcissistic, bipolar and selfish. Those words fit right in. Every night, my \u201cstepfathers\u201d wait at the door for Marie (Mother) to open the door for them. After that they get drunk. Beyond getting drunk? I don\u2019t know. We are forced to go to sleep early and it\u2019s not like I want to find out.\r  \n\r  \nI can\u2019t run away either. Where can I live then? Momma is the only family member left and I don\u2019t even go to school anymore to find friends that would be happy to let them into their homes.\r  \n\r  \nThe cops won\u2019t do anything either because I don\u2019t even have a goddamn phone to call them.\r  \n\r  \nI really wish dad was here. The last memory of him was the time he took us to the park one summer evening 4 years ago while mom was out with some friends. I knew he was sick, but he didn\u2019t want to admit it.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDad?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYeah sport?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat happens if you go away?\u201d\r  \nHe turned to face me, his face glowing in the fading sunlight. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cJust remember that I\u2019ll always be with you guys no matter what. Even if I\u2019m gone, just remember that I\u2019ll always be there for you.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI looked up at him. Eyes swimming with tears, I said, \u201cOk dad\u201d.\r  \n\r  \nI sniffed.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cTh-thanks dad. I love you too\u201d.\r  \n\r  \nThen he fell to the ground with a thud.\r  \n\r  \nI screamed and screamed and screamed.\r  \n\r  \n  \n\r  \n\r  \n\\*  \\*  \\*\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAs I lay in my bed I couldn\u2019t help thinking about that time. It was a pure nightmare, one that I can\u2019t forget, ever. Painful images swam in my head, mostly about how my dad dropped dead that evening. I wanted the memories to stop coming to me. Why now?\r  \n\r  \nThere was a song he used to sing to us when we were still in diapers. Every time he sang it my heart would think it could fly from my chest up to heaven. I always felt like a shield was surrounding me from any danger when each word came out of his mouth.\r  \n\r  \nLittle one,\r  \n\r  \nDon\u2019t be scared,\r  \n\r  \nI will always be there,\r  \n\r  \nDon\u2019t be scared,\r  \n\r  \nNot even the devil will care,\r  \n\r  \nDon\u2019t be scared,\r  \n\r  \nMy love is in the air\r  \n\r  \nDon\u2019t be scared.\r  \n\r  \nI repeated the lyrics over and over in my head until I managed to get rid of all the memories of the incident in my head. I was just drifting to the depths of sleep when I started to hear voices coming from the room next to mine.\r  \n\r  \nMother?\r  \n\r  \nNo, her room was upstairs. I should know this.\r  \n\r  \n(i should know this)\r  \n\r  \nMy mind is foggy from exhaustion. Acting as a slave for your mother isn\u2019t easy. We have to mop the floor, clean up the booze from the carpet by wiping it and even wash the clothes of my dirty step dads.\r  \n\r  \nThe voice persisted to the point that I could identify the words\r  \n\r  \n(singing)\r  \n\r  \nand what it is. Singing? Why would someone be singing at this hour and who is it? I slid from my bed and onto the floor, landing on my belly but getting back up.\r  \n\r  \nMan, I am really tired.\r  \n\r  \nI walked through the dark hallway, listening to the singing getting louder and more intelligible as I got closer to my brother\u2019s room.\r  \n\r  \nWhy the hell is my brother singing this late? Not like he had ever sung a song in his life for that matter. At least not that I can remember.\r  \n\r  \nI put my ear on the door of my brother\u2019s bedroom and listened:\r  \n\r  \nLittle one,\r  \n\r  \nDon\u2019t be scared,\r  \n\r  \nI will always be there,\r  \n\r  \nDon\u2019t be scared,\r  \n\r  \nNot even the devil will care,\r  \n\r  \nDon\u2019t be scared,\r  \n\r  \nMy love is in the air\r  \n\r  \nDon\u2019t be scared,\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d, I said out loud.\r  \n\r  \nOk, now I am seriously puzzled and confused. He doesn\u2019t even care about dad that much yet he is singing it. It doesn\u2019t make any sense, what the hell.\r  \n\r  \nWith anger and some confusion, I pushed the door open. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cBro, what the fuck are you doing\u201d, I said as I switched on the light.\r  \n\r  \nHe stood up from his bed and looked at me with an ear-to-ear grin.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cLittle one,\r  \n\r  \nDon\u2019t be scared,\r  \n\r  \nI will always be there\u2014,\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cShut up, I'm tryna sleep here, and all I can hear is you singing. You never even cared about dad in the first place so why sing that fucking song. Go to be\u2014\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI will always be there,\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDon\u2019t be scared,\r  \n\r  \nNot even the devil will care,\r  \n\r  \nDon\u2019t be scared\u2014\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSHUT THE F\u2014\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThat\u2019s when I heard it. The bed creaked and groaned as a humanoid figure was emerging from under it. Its pale skin reflected the moonlight from the window. \r  \n\r  \nWords cannot describe the shock I felt in that moment.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWha\u2014\u201d, I stuttered.\r  \n\r  \nThe creature eyed me with morbid curiosity, then seemed to smile with its twisted mouth. There was something about that smile that I loved. I couldn\u2019t quite explain it.\r  \n\r  \n(its face)\r  \n\r  \nThe face was critically familiar. Where have I seen it? Why has my memory suddenly gone blank?\r  \n\r  \nMy brother, still grinning, began to sing once more:\r  \n\r  \nLittle one,\r  \n\r  \nDon\u2019t be scared,\r  \n\r  \nI will always be there,\r  \n\r  \nDon\u2019t be scared,\r  \n\r  \nNot even the devil will care,\r  \n\r  \nDon\u2019t be scared,\r  \n\r  \nMy love is in the air\r  \n\r  \nDon\u2019t be scared,\r  \n \r  \nThe creature rested its abnormally large hand on my brother\u2019s head and squeezed.\r  \n\r  \n(splat)\r  \n\r  \nI fell to my knees. I had had enough. My mind was blank and blood is on my face and walls and hair and\r  \n\r  \n(shut up)\r  \n\r  \nnow my mind is on overdrive.\r  \n \r  \nWhat remained of my brother now lay on the bed soaked with blood. The creature let its hand drop to its side and smiled wider.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWh\u2013what the hell do you want\u201d, I roared at it.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWHAT ARE YOU!\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe eerie smile seemed to grow larger and broader. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou\u2019ve grown, sport\u201d, The creature rasped.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHas Marie been treating you well?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI couldn\u2019t respond. How could I? I\u2019m talking to a damn monster. \r  \n\r  \n(footsteps)\r  \n\r  \nOh shit. My mom is coming. That means\u2014\r  \n\r  \nMy mother came bursting into the room with her 2 new husbands, obviously drunk and intoxicated. They panned the room, looking at all the gore until their eyes had lain on the creature.\r  \n\r  \nEveryone stopped moving, it was as if time had stopped. Time was now just an illusion in my eyes as the creature launched itself onto my mother and her husbands. My brain couldn\u2019t process the gore and violence that was unfolding in front of me. \r  \n\r  \nBlood splashed all over the place, limbs flew around the room, organs and intestines dropped to the floor like damp clothes.\r  \n\r  \nIt was a massacre.\r  \n\r  \nAll I heard was guttural groaning before I blacked out completely.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n \\*   \\*   \\*\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nWaking up and getting up from the wet floor had been a mission. My clothes are soaked with blood and the metallic smell of blood has invaded my nostrils. I limped toward the door, every step shot excruciating pain in my head.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cJesus\u201d, I muttered. Blood dripping from my clothes and dropping onto the gory floor.\r  \n\r  \nAs I made it to the hallway, I couldn\u2019t help sensing the creature somewhere near me. I had a strong feeling, a really strong feeling that it\u2019s close\r  \n\r  \n(inside of me)\r  \n\r  \nby.\r  \n\r  \nMy chest suddenly felt like it was being slashed by a machete. My knees gave way and I dropped to the floor, knees getting soaked from blood.\r  \n\r  \nMy heart had burst.\r  \n\r  \nBlood ran down my bare ribcage and onto the already blood-soaked floor. Shock had overcome my face as I looked up.\r  \n\r  \n(dad)\r  \n\r  \nA groan escaped me, then the tears came. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cHey sport. How are you doing\u201d, his honey-like voice chirped.\r  \n\r  \nTears flowed down my cheeks like waterfalls. \u201cD\u2014Dad?\u201d.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSport, we can go down to the park if you want. It\u2019s not that cold outside\u201d, he said.\r  \n\r  \nNot feeling pain any longer, I stood up and looked into the eyes of my loving father.\r  \nBlood was everywhere, but I didn\u2019t fucking care. My dad had come to save me from this shit life, and he is right in front of me right now. Nothing matters now, I can finally rest. \r  \n\r  \nMy dad wasn\u2019t a human to begin with. He took square pills that made him sick, but now I know why.\r  \n\r  \nHe stood over 8 feet tall, with a gangling frame. Claws sprouted from his arms, legs, hands, feet, neck and back. His face was completely normal except for the dark outline around his head.\r  \n\r  \nI stepped forward and wrapped my arms around him. Tears formed and died in my eyes, spilling down my wet cheeks like waves of the sea. Father did the same.\r  \n\r  \nWe embraced for a while longer until father was the first one to break it. The house was coated in scarlet and debris of the people I knew but hated.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDad?\u201d, I said\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYeah sport?\u201d. He slumped to the ground to sit.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cCan you sing to me please?\u201d.\r  \n\r  \nHe smiled a million dollar smile and laughed. Every second of that laughter made my heart yet again want to fly from its home. Not that I have a heart anymore.\r  \n\r  \nLittle one,\r  \n\r  \nDon\u2019t be scared,\r  \n\r  \nI will always be there,\r  \n\r  \nDon\u2019t be scared,\r  \n\r  \nNot even the devil will care,\r  \n\r  \nDon\u2019t be scared,\r  \n\r  \nMy love is in the air\r  \n\r  \nDon\u2019t be scared.\r  \n\r  \nFather drew a breath. \u201cSo, sport\u201d.\r  \n\r  \nI looked up at him, focusing full attention. His tone was serious now.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWho else was bothering you?\u201d, he asked\r  \n\r  \nHe expanded his claws out of their sockets and shot a nefarious grin\r  \nI smiled. \u201cNo, but California has a lot of people in it\u201d.\r  \n\r  \nSomewhere in the house, my mother let out her last breath.",

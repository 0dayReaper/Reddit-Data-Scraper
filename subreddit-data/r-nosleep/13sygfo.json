    "postText": "I don't know what to do. In the past 72 hours my life has been turned upside-down. Our family has been thrown into chaos. My wife is missing, and I fear she'll never return.\n\nLet me start from the beginning.\n\nMy wife and I started playing hide and seek with our two young kids. However, they're a little too young to hide effectively--they always hide in the same spot, every time. So we've found it's more fun for one of us parents to hide, and then the rest of us seek.\n\nI've hidden from my wife and kids just by standing completely still in the corner of a dark room. It's amazing how our brains are programmed to see things that move. My wife gets a little more creative, but it's hard for us to do anything too elaborate because the kids are not very cooperative in waiting for us to hide.\n\nOn Tuesday evening after work, we decided to play. My wife decided to hide first. I counted down from 10 with the kids holed up in the downstairs office.\n\n\"Ready or not, here I come!\"\n\nThe kids bounded out of the room like wild dogs. I followed, slowly, trying to get a sense of where my wife was hiding. I'd often try to figure out what room she was hiding in first, to gently guide the kids so that we wouldn't find her too soon, or spend too long looking for her.\n\nI saw her when I entered the living room. She was crouched behind the couch--I could see a bit of her elbow poking out from behind the upholstery. The kids walked right past her, too intent on checking the kitchen.\n\nI waited for them to return. As they walked back in and rounded the couch, I waited for them to squeal in delight.\n\nExcept they didn't. Confused, I approached the couch--\n\nShe wasn't there.\n\n*Huh*. Maybe I'd just seen a tag or something poking out. Or maybe she'd moved her hiding spot. Wouldn't be the first time. As I said, she's more creative at this than I am.\n\nSo we moved on. We checked all the usual spots--underneath the shelving in the garage, behind the kitchen door, even in the lower kitchen cabinets.\n\nShe wasn't in any of those spots.\n\n*Maybe she went upstairs.* I hadn't heard her go upstairs, but she can creep pretty quietly. I walked along the hallways, the kids in tow. \"Jessie,\" I called, in a sing-song voice. \"We're going to find you!\"\n\n*Gotcha.*\n\nOur bedroom door was open. And there was a long, Jess-shaped lump under the covers. \"Let's check Mom and Dad's bedroom!\" I said to the kids. Pattering footsteps as they charged behind me.\n\nI reached for the light switch--flicked on the lights--then grabbed the hem of the comforter and yanked it off.\n\nMy heart dropped.\n\nThe bed was empty.\n\nI stared down in confusion. *It must've just been bunched up weirdly? But I could've sworn it looked like a person under there... The rough shape of someone in a fetal position, legs bent, back curved...*\n\nI backed out of the room. The kids and I went downstairs. \"Jess,\" I called out. \"We can't find you. Come on out.\"\n\nNothing.\n\nThe kids lost interest. They bounded into the family room and began playing with their cars. I was about to call out to her again, when I noticed the chain of the basement door lock was disengaged.\n\n*Aha.*\n\nAs I approached, my heart hammered in my chest. I knew she was waiting on the other side. Waiting to jump out at me and give me a heart attack. She'd done that before.\n\nI took a deep breath and swung open the door--\n\nShe wasn't there.\n\nDamp air wafted up from the basement. I clicked on the light. \"Jess?\" I called out.\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"The kids aren't playing anymore,\" I called down. \"And you shouldn't be hiding down there anyway. These stairs are too dangerous.\" Nothing. I turned, about to close the door\u2014but then something caught my eye.\n\nBlack hair. Poking through the gap between the stairs, about halfway down.\n\n*She's hiding under the stairs.*\n\nI stepped down. The wood creaked under my weight. The hair glistened below me in the dim yellow light. I continued down the steps, avoiding stepping on her hair, until I was standing on the concrete floor.\n\nI whirled around\u2014\n\n\"Aha!\"\n\nBut the space under the stairs was empty.\n\nMy blood ran cold. \"Jess, this isn't funny!\" I shouted. \u201cStop playing games with me!\u201d\n\nA footstep sounded behind me. I whirled around.\n\nThe naked bulb in the ceiling only lit half the basement. The other half, where we had rows and rows of storage boxes, was in near-total darkness.\n\nBut...\n\nI squinted, trying to make it out. In the murky darkness... behind a stack of boxes, in the corner... I thought I could see her standing there.\n\nI could only see her in my peripheral vision. Like how you can only see dim stars when you\u2019re not looking right at them, because of how your optic cells are arranged. I focused on one of the storage boxes, really stared at it; and when I did, I realized I could see her pale calves, extending up into the darkness.\n\nAnd, as I stood there, I realized I could hear her breathing.\n\n\"I can see you there,\u201d I said, my voice wavering. \u201cWhy are you being so weird? The kids aren't even playing anymore. So come out. Please?\"\n\nDeep in the pit of my stomach, I knew there was something wrong. Something horribly wrong. So I chickened out.\n\n\"I'm going upstairs. You can join me when you're ready.\"\n\nI headed for the stairs. But halfway there, the bulb flickered\u2014and went out.\n\nTotal darkness surrounded me. I stretched my hands out, blindly groping into the darkness. They only fell on air. I frantically pawed through the air, searching for something, anything\u2014\n\nMy fingers caught in something.\n\nHair.\n\nI screamed and yanked my hands back. Then I ran blindly into the darkness\u2014but something glanced off me. I shoved at it\u2014I heard a dull *thwack*\u2014and then I kept running. The side of the banister caught me straight in the chest. Panting, I felt my way to the stairs and climbed them as fast as I could.\n\nThen I locked the door to the basement and frantically ran to my kids.\n\nThey were fine. But as I hugged them, I couldn\u2019t get the horrible thought out of my mind. The hair I\u2019d felt\u2026 it was higher than my eye level. About six, six-and-a-half feet off the ground.\n\nJess is only 5\u2019 2\u201d.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe police searched the entire house. My wife isn't here.\n\nThey searched the backyard and patrolled in a three mile radius. They came up empty-handed. It's like she disappeared off the face of the earth.\n\nExcept.\n\nLast night, as I rolled over in bed, *I swear* my fingers touched something [warm.](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)",

It sounds like whoever you keep finding meets her description,  so the simplest answer is that it is her. But the tall one freaks me out. I'd really like to think that's her, but somehow reality has shifted.  Just a theory. I hope you get her back! \n\nMaybe try playing another game of hide and seek in the exact same way as that fateful game to see if you can pull her back ?",

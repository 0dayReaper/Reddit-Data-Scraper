    "postText": "Side by side, we continued on our path, skirting through the lower section of the factory. After my initial shock, my heart rate had slowed to a healthier pace again. Frankie had assured me that his old boss most likely hadn\u2019t heard us (\u201cShe used to have her earbuds in all the time with the volume cranked way up\u2014you couldn\u2019t have gotten her attention if you\u2019d tried\u201d), but we still considered it prude to move forward at a more hurried pace. \n\nWe soon came to the conclusion that we would have to go up one of the outside staircases. Frankie admitted in humiliation that his memories of the factory weren\u2019t as accurate as he\u2019d thought\u2014either that or FunFlair had made a few changes to the building. The upper floor containers all had glass doors, presenting us with a sticky problem. If we were to go up there directly, we\u2019d probably be spotted immediately. \n\n\n\u201cThis warrants a change of plans,\u201d I declared soberly, keeping my voice low. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to knock her out, then.\u201d\n\nFrankie whimpered.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like that?\u201d I prompted. \u201cI\u2019d be the one to do it, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cYe-es.\u201d He shuddered. \u201cIt\u2019d be satisfactory for sure, but that\u2019s only assuming nothing goes wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe can hardly be stronger than I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I guess not. She, uh\u2026 yeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, then.\u201d I offered an encouraging smile as I started leading the way back outside. \n\nWe rounded the container with the lights on inside, ascending the metal grate staircase connected to it. Every step carried us closer towards the light. Just before the door fully came into view, I turned to Frankie one last time. \u201cAre you alright? This\u2019ll be it in a moment.\u201d\n\nHe made another chew-toy sound.\n\n\u201cFran, what is it? If you know something I don\u2019t about what might happen in there\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t see me,\u201d he squeaked out. \u201cI can\u2019t control myself around her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand; did you two use to be an item?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! No, no, no. I can\u2019t explain it any other way. She can make me do things I don\u2019t want,\u201d he told me, his tone growing in desperation. \n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d take too long to explain now, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s really very complicated. Please, can you do it without me? I can\u2019t go up there after all, I\u2019m so sorry but I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\nI sighed, leaning in to put my arms around him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I whispered into his hair. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. Wait here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry, Eva. I swear I\u2019ll make it up to you. This is the last time I\u2019ll ask something like this of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI doubt it,\u201d I replied. \u201cBut it\u2019s okay.\u201d I drew back, reluctantly letting go of him. \u201cFor now, it\u2019s okay.\u201d I continued marching up the stairs. Behind the glass door, a feminine figure in a black rubber apron came into view. She seemed to be nimbly skirting around another operating table, this one occupied by a fully formed, petite doll. *Now or never.* I reached for the doorhandle, pushed it down and crossed the threshold in a single, large step. I slammed the door shut behind my back, drawing the attention of the woman.\n\nShe looked up at me, her eyes widening in shock behind her thick glasses. With a swipe of her slender fingers, she removed her earbuds, dropping them into her pocket. \n\n\u201cAre you Philomena Wallis?\u201d I asked.\n\nFor a split second, she appeared to be too stunned to speak. Her pale face was framed by messy strands of jet-black hair that had worked their way out of her long ponytail. When she broke from her silence, she spoke with an irritatingly pearly voice. \u201cWho\u2019s asking?\u201d\n\n\u201cA former delivery girl. Well, are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am. I don\u2019t understand; I-I\u2019ve never seen you before\u2026 How did you end up here? What do you want?\u201d \n\nI took in a deep breath. I glanced over at the door, inwardly cursing myself for what I was about to ask her. \u201cI need to know what you did to Frankie Preston.\u201d\n\nFor a couple seconds, silence reigned. The other woman was staring at me with knotted brows. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she said finally.\n\n\u201cAbout yay high\u2014,\u201d I raised my hand above my head, \u201cslightly built, blond curly hair, dreamy smile\u2026\u201d\n\nPhilomena narrowed her eyes. I cleared my throat, holding her gaze. Then a look of cold comprehension settled on her features. \u201cOh my god,\u201d she muttered. \u201cHoly shit\u2026 hold on.\u201d She turned around, pulling up a photo on her computer. \u201cIs that him?\u201d\n\nI cautiously stepped closer to get a better look, only to shrink back slightly. It was, indeed, a picture of Fran. He was entirely naked in it, lying on a table similar to the one I was standing in front of now, his wrists and ankles locked in restraints. His neck was craned, his face averted. The camera had caught him mid-motion, a blur around his head visually conveying a kind of violence in the movement. I couldn\u2019t bear to look at it any longer. Instead, I moved closer to the doll on Philomena\u2019s table, taking her in fully. Another blonde\u2014her hair was straight, though. Her body was exaggeratedly curvy, her face delicate and fawn. Speechless, I locked eyes with Philomena from across the room again. She gave me a light shrug. \u201cYou look like you need some time for this to sink in,\u201d she remarked, drawing out the words. \u201cI take it you didn\u2019t have all the information previously.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d I replied. \u201cI think I get it now.\u201d My head felt empty, my own voice seemingly echoing back and forth between my ears.\n\n\u201cSo, you know my prototype,\u201d she stated, confusion and disbelief mixing in her tone. \u201cHe told you how to get here, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a way.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you came here to find out,\u201d she concluded. \u201cThere\u2019s not much I can tell you that you haven\u2019t figured out by now. We wanted to create the most detailed doll there was. He was our first attempt. I started developing him back in the late nineties as just a hopeful pet project. I kept adding more functions as time went on, though, and he turned into an insanely lucrative prospect. I wanted him to be able to move and dance and mimic an airflow, and it worked out better than I\u2019d ever expected. So he can do a lot of things, but I never intended for him to have any sensory awareness or to talk\u2026 I have no idea how that happened. It just did. One day, I turned him on and he simply *looked* at me. There was something different about his eyes, and I knew right away he wasn\u2019t the same as before. And then of course he spoke.\u201d\n\nA shudder ran through her entire upper body at the memory. \u201cI have no idea how. None of us did at the time. He had no recorded voice lines or anything of the sort. And yet, he opened up his mouth and there was just\u2026 words coming out, like.\u201d She shook her head in bewilderment at the memory. \u201cAfter I got over the initial shock, I realized how big of a problem this was. He was telling me to stay away from him; he wouldn\u2019t do a thing I told him anymore. There was my best invention in the entire field yet, *rebelling* like a teenager. When I tried to get him back in line, he got physical, too. Thrashed around like crazy. One of my assistants ended up concussed because that thing threw him down a flight of stairs. So we had to put an end to that, as well.\u201d\n\nA faint feeling of nausea seeped into the pit of my stomach, strengthening by the second. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we had to take him apart, of course! And put him back together. Wash, rinse, repeat. We kept trying to figure out what was wrong with him, or at least to find a way to stop his babbling and hitting people. We didn\u2019t, though. We managed to control his outbursts, though. He was made to react to voice commands, but obviously, that wasn\u2019t working anymore. So after the umpteenth time we rebuilt him, we managed to make it so he couldn\u2019t physically attack people. Don\u2019t ask me about the finer details of his programming; the process was beyond tedious. Anyways, he kept talking and moving around on his own even afterwards. He\u2019d only listen to what we told him *occasionally* and even then, he\u2019d mouth off. We didn\u2019t want to discard all the progress we\u2019d made, though. He was still an incredibly well-made doll, even if he was\u2026 apparently possessed and sentient.\n\n\u201cWe built two more like him. We tried harder with their faces seeing as that of the prototype had fallen very far into the uncanny valley. They turned out great, perfectly shaped and working smoothly. Their development took a lot less time than that of the prototype. Once we were sure they were all good, we started talking about destroying the first one. We\u2019d kept him locked up in the meantime, but the little fucker kept on breaking out. We\u2019d literally cuff him to the wall and moments later, he\u2019d come up behind me and scare me half to death. He was becoming a bigger nuisance every day. We were set on taking him apart a final time, but before we could, he disappeared. He\u2019d destroyed all our equipment he\u2019d gotten his hands on, stolen unnameable sums from our online banking accounts\u2014Lord knows how he did that\u2014and worst of all, he somehow managed to\u2026 *activate* the two new builds. He destroyed most of the cameras, but the footage that was left clearly showed them walking around with him. And that\u2019s that.\u201d She palmed her forehead. \u201cHow did he get away from the people I sent after him?\u201d\n\n\u201cLargely with my help.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh. So who are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cStill just a former delivery girl.\u201d Shrugging off my jacket, I made room for my extra limbs to breach my skin, simultaneously opening my mouth as my teeth morphed into fangs. \n\nPhilomena watched my transformation almost disaffectedly. Her steps as she carried herself over to her operating table however nearly faltered. Before I could advance on her, she\u2019d cupped the sleeping dolls cheeks, causing the limp body to spring to life. The mannequin\u2019s head jerked up along with her torso. In several clipped, mechanical movements, she slid off the surface, placing her naked feet on the floor. Her eyes flew open, fixing me with an empty glare. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the fuck you are or what you want from me,\u201d Philomena began, \u201cbut I\u2019ve got weak nerd arms. So have fun dealing with this instead.\u201d\n\nI shrank back a step, the memory of Frankie picking me up like I weighed nothing fresh in my mind. Phil pressed her lips to the side of the puppet\u2019s face, whispering something I couldn\u2019t make out before quickly drawing aside. Before I could do so much as blink, the doll was upon me, crossing the distance between us in one impressive leap. She toppled me over, instantly reaching for my throat. I batted her cold, rubbery hands away, then pried her off of me with all my might. Using two of my tentacles, I flung her aside, sending her crashing into a shelf in the corner. Not wasting another second, I lunged at Wallis, delivering a blow to her head that sent her staggering. She sank back against her desk and I lashed out at her once more, briefly shutting my eyes to spare myself the sight of her face connecting squarely with the wooden surface as I bashed her down on against it.\n\nShe fell limp, and while I wasn\u2019t sure if she was still breathing or not, I didn\u2019t take the time to check. Her puppet was rising to her feet again, striding towards me in a vacantly determined fashion. I whirled around, bursting through the door and taking two steps at once. Frankie was waiting for me at the bottom of the metal staircase, his face falling when he caught my expression. \n\n\u201cKnocked her out,\u201d I gasped. \u201cWe have a problem, though.\u201d\n\nFran looked up at the glass door, the hinges of which were already groaning under the pressure of the mannequin throwing herself against it from the inside. With a sharp crack, a tear began to grow on the thick pane, and Frankie cursed loudly. \u201cGet away from here!\u201d he hollered, nudging me into the general direction of the woods. \u201cI doused everything I could find down here,\u201d he explained quickly. \u201cIf Phil\u2019s out, I\u2019ll do her room, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about the\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNever you mind that! I can hold her off no problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou literally took out the one thing holding me back,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you get hurt out here. Just wait for me over by the trees.\u201d\n\nI still wouldn\u2019t budge, so he grabbed a bunch of my tentacles and used them to turn me around. \u201cGet your cute-ass face out of here, Sunshine!\u201d\n\nI started running, albeit reluctantly. A loud crashing noise rang out from behind me as the door burst under Phil\u2019s puppet\u2019s onslaught, but I forced myself to keep from turning around. Ignoring the searing hot feeling of panic raging inside my chest, I carried myself further and further away from the scene, only stopping when I reached the treeline. There, pressing myself up against the rough bark of the nearest trunk just to ground myself, I resigned to staring at the containers. I couldn\u2019t see the waiter from where I was standing, but my eyes remained trained on the factory. They were gradually drying out, but despite the pain, I kept them wide open. I didn\u2019t dare to blink. \n\nFor several minutes, all was still. The only sound I could hear was the frantic beating of my own heart and my pulse thrumming in my ears. Then, all of a sudden, inferno broke loose. Bright flames started to spread from around the sides of the building, quickly rising high into the sky. Crackling and roaring, they soon enveloped the entire site, lighting up the rooms behind the formerly dark windows. And emerging from the fire like a bird of myth came Frankie Preston. He was running, but with a light spring in his step that almost made it look like he was dancing.\n\nHe came to a halt in front of me, lifting his head to meet my gaze. His expression was difficult to read. It still looked empty, but in a different way. In a good way. \u201cHi,\u201d he began.\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d\n\nThe firelight was bouncing off his curls and playing on his thick lashes, putting a reddish glint into his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d I added.\n\nHe drew in a little closer. No gasp preceded his smile. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\n\n\u201cI, uh\u2026 I don\u2019t know yet.\u201d He glanced between me and the burning containers. \n\n\u201cOkay. Take your time.\u201d I stretched my arms and rolled my shoulders, shrugging my additional limbs back into the inside of my body. \n\n\u201cSay, where do they go when you don\u2019t have them out?\u201d Frankie asked with a raised brow.\n\n\u201cI never know.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm.\u201d He turned to stand at my side. At first, his knuckles merely grazed mine, then he flipped his hand to link his fingers with mine. I briefly smiled at his profile, then went back to admiring the flames.\n\n\u201cDo you think the whole woods are gonna burn down?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d he replied, shrugging. \u201cThough that would be pretty cool\u2026\u201d He trailed off when I shot him a reprimanding look. \u201cYeah, yeah, we can call the fire fighters or whatever. Later, though, alright?\u201d\n\nI rested my head against the side of his arm. \u201cSure. Later.\u201d\n\nFor a couple minutes, neither of us spoke. The only sound was the steady crackling and occasional thump as bit by bit, the structure collapsed. \u201cSo, um\u2026 this is pretty amazing,\u201d Fran said in a low voice. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve never been happy before; my life\u2019s kind of had its ups and downs, it\u2019s just that this is better than any *up* there\u2019s been so far. I guess I\u2019m just really grateful and you ought to know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know.\u201d I paused. \u201cCan we get out of here? The place is starting to stink.\u201d\n\nHe nodded agreeably and we turned our backs on the scene, only for our retreat to be abruptly stopped by a garbled, drawn-out screech. We spun around in perfect synchronicity. I couldn\u2019t stop myself from letting out a sharp cry of shock. From the burning wreckage, a figure dragged itself forth on her hands. Philomena\u2019s puppet had suffered immense damage in the fire. Her skin, obviously not made to withstand extreme heat, was melting off her face like molten candle wax. The wires that were bared beneath gave off angry sparks. She couldn\u2019t seem to get up anymore, her legs were beyond repair and her movements overall were getting more and more arduous. She dug her fingers into the ground, pulling her body across the forest floor in slow, pained jerks. \n\n\u201cWhat the fuck? I thought I switched her off,\u201d Frankie uttered beside me, sounding just as terrified as *I* felt.\n\n\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d I exhaled the words in a single quick breath, unable to take my eyes off the doll. \n\n\u201cI got no idea\u2026 I-I don\u2019t wanna deal with this\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to help her or something, she\u2019s\u2014she\u2019s awake!\u201d Before I could say anything else, the doll had emerged from the blaze. Rolling around, she managed to quench the remaining flames, pressing the dirt and leaves into her own dripping, melting body. Finally, she started trying to push herself up into a sitting position, only to fail miserably. I took a slow, tentative step towards her twitching form. Her face was contorted into a nightmarish grimace, and she let out an incomprehensible gurgle upon noticing me approaching. She reached out a mangled hand and I stumbled backwards before she could grab my ankle. \n\nDespite the heat, beads of cold, fearful sweat were running down my face. I had no idea what to do. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave her,\u201d I said, my throat bone-dry. \u201cThere\u2019s something in there, she\u2019s not like before.\u201d\n\nFran let out an exasperated, long-suffering sigh. \u201cIs there any use in arguing?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so cold.\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you used to it by now?\u201d\n\nI turned to look at him over my shoulder. He met my gaze and I could see something in his features change or perhaps even soften. He threw his head back, then pulled out his phone. \u201cThis is gonna ruin my night, but *fine*. I\u2019m calling that insufferable news lady.\u201d\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13dr5g0/help_im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[2:

There's no way I can respond to each of you individually, so I'm just going to address some common things again, and then move on to the stories. I'm going to write as many as I can think of, in addition to my friend's stories, and I will probably not update again until I get a chance to answer some questions that I myself have for my superiors.\n\nAlright, so the common questions I found you all had:\n\n* I am not comfortable talking about where exactly I work, unfortunately. In all reality some of the things I've mentioned here could get me in a lot of trouble or fired, so it's best if I just don't discuss too much. I will say that I'm in the United States, and in an area that is comprised of a great deal of wilderness. We're talking hundreds of miles of thick forest, with a mountain range and a few lakes.\n\n* There is still a great amount of interest in the stairs, and luckily for you guys my friend has a story that I think you'll all be very interested in. I'll go into that more at the end of this update. As for whether or not I have ever thought of asking my superiors about them, I have, but again, I don't want to risk my job. However, one of my former superiors no longer works as an SAR officer, and it's possible that he may be willing to talk to me about it. I'll be speaking to him later in the week, and I will let you all know what comes of that.\n\n* As far as advice on becoming an SAR officer goes, I think the best advice I can give is to contact your local Forest Service office and see if they offer and training courses, or what the qualifications are. I've been doing this for years, and I started out as a volunteer helping on SAR operations. It's a great job, despite the occasional tragic situations, and I wouldn't want to do anything else. \n\nAlright, let's move on to the stories:\n\n* The first happened on a case that I went out on right after I got out of training, and was still pretty new to everything. Before I took this job, I was a volunteer, so I had a basic idea of what to expect, but on those calls you're mostly dealing with finding lost people after vets have found signs of them. As an SAR officer, you go out for all kinds of cases, from animal bites to heart attacks. \nThis case got called in early in the morning, from a young couple who were up on one of the trails that goes by the lake. The husband was completely hysterical, and we couldn't really figure out what was going on. We could hear the woman screaming in the background, and he was begging us to come up there right away. When we get there, we see him holding his wife, and shes got something in her arms. She's screaming these awful, almost animal-like screams, and he's sobbing. He sees us and he screams at us to help them, to please get an ambulance up there. Now obviously we can't just drive an ambulance up the walking path, so we ask him if his wife needs help, or if she can walk on her own. He's still hysterical, but he manages to tell us that it's not his wife that needs help. I go over while one of the vets tries to calm him down, and I ask the wife what's going on. She's rocking, holding something, and just shrieking, over and over. I crouch down and see that whatever she's holding, it's covering her with blood. That's when I notice the sling on her front and my heart sinks. I ask her to tell me what's going on, and I sort of pry her arms gently open so I can see what she's holding. It's her baby, obviously dead. His head is caved in on one side, and he's covered in scratches. Now, I've seen dead bodies before, but something about this whole situation hits me hard. I have to take a second to compose myself, and I get up and go get one of the other vets, who's standing by. I tell him that it's a dead kid, and he sort of pats my shoulder and tells me he'll deal with it.\nIt took us over an hour to get this woman to let us see her kid. Every time we try to take him from her, she flips out and tells us we can't have him, that he'll be okay if we just leave her alone and let her help him. But eventually, one of the vets manages to calm her down, and she gives us the body. We took it back to the med area, but when the EMTs showed up, they told us that there was never any hope of saving the kid. He'd died instantly from the trauma to his head.\nI was good buddies with one of the nurses who met them at the hospital, and she told me later what had happened. Turns out the couple had been walking with the baby in the sling, and they stopped because the kid was fussing. The dad takes the kid and is holding him, looking out over this little gully by the path. The mom comes to stand next to him, but she ends up stepping on a loose patch of soil, and she trips. She falls into the dad, who drops the kid, who ends up falling about twenty feet down this little gully onto the rocks at the bottom. The dad climbed down and recovered the kid, but he'd fallen right on his head, and was dead by the time he got there. The baby was only about fifteen months old. It was a total freak accident, a series of events that coalesced into the worst possible outcome. Probably one of the more awful calls I've been on.\n\n* I haven't seen a lot of animal bites in my time as an SAR officer, mostly because there aren't that many animals that come around the area. While there are bears in the area, they tend to stay pretty far away from people, and sightings are highly unusual. Most of the animals you'll see are small ones, like coyotes, raccoons, or skunks. What we do see frequently, though, are moose. And let me tell you, moose are nasty fuckers. They'll chase after anything for any reason, and god help you if you get in between a female and its baby. One of the more amusing calls was of a guy who'd gotten chased down by an absolutely massive male moose, and was stuck up a tree. Took us almost an hour to get him down, and when he was finally on solid ground again, he looks at me and says: 'God damn. Them fuckers is big up close.' I guess that's not really a scary story, but we still laugh about that one.\n\n* I honestly don't know how I'd forgotten this story, but it is, by far, the scariest thing that's happened to me. I guess maybe I've tried so long to forget about it that it just didn't come to mind right away. As someone who spends literally all of their time in the woods, you don't ever want to let yourself get scared of being alone, or out in the middle of nowhere. That's why when you have experiences like this, you tend to just forget about them and move on. This is, to date, the only thing that's ever made me really seriously consider if this job is the right one for me. I don't really like talking about it much, but I'll do the best I can to remember it all.\nAs I recall, this took place right at the end of spring. It was a typical lost-child call: a four-year-old girl had wandered away from her family's campsite, and had been missing for about two hours. Her parents were completely despondent, and told us what most parents do; my kid would never wander away, she's so good about staying close, she's never done anything like this before. We assure the parents that we'll do everything we can to find her, and we spread out in a standard search formation. I was partnered with one of my good buddies, and we were sort of casually holding conversation while we hiked. I know it sounds callous, but you do sort of become desensitized when you've done this long enough. It becomes the norm, and I think to a certain extent you have to learn to desensitize yourself in order to work this job. \nWe search for a good two hours, going well beyond where we think she'd be, and we come out of a small valley when something makes us both stop in unison. We freeze and look at each other, and there's almost a sensation like a plane depressurizing. My ears pop, and I have this odd sensation of having dropped about ten feet. I start to ask my buddy if he felt that, but before I can, we hear the loudest sound I've ever heard in my life. It's almost like a freight train passing directly by us, but it's coming from every direction at once, including above and below us. He screams something to me, but I can't hear him over this deafening roar. Understandably freaked out, we look all around us, trying to find the source of the sound, but neither of us sees anything. Of course, my first thought is a landslide, but we're not near any cliffs, and even if we were, it would have hit us by now. The sound goes on and on, and we're trying to yell to each other, but even standing close together we can't hear anything but this sound. Then, as suddenly as it starts, it stops, like someone threw a switch and cut it off. We stand there for a second, perfectly still, and slowly the normal sounds of the woods come back. He asks me what the fuck just happened, but I just kind of shrug, and we stand there looking at each other for a minute. I get on the radio and ask if anyone else just heard the end of the fucking world, but no one else hears it, even though we're all within shouting distance of each other. My buddy and I just sort of shrug it off and keep going.\nAbout an hour later, we all check up on the radios, and no one's found the little girl. Most of the time, we won't search when it gets dark, but because we don't have any kind of lead on her, a few of us decide to keep going, including me and my buddy. We keep close together, and we're calling out for her every couple of minutes. At this point, I'm hoping beyond hope that we find her, because while I may not like kids, the idea of them being out all alone in the dark is awful. The woods can be intimidating to kids in the daylight; at night, well, it's a whole different beast. But we're not seeing any signs of her, or getting any responses, and around midnight, we decide to turn around and head back to the rendezvous point. \nWe're about halfway back when my buddy stops and shines his light to the right of us, into a really thick deadfall, or group of dead trees. I ask him if he's heard a response, but he just tells me to be quiet a second and listen. I do, and in the distance, I can hear what sounds like a kid crying. We both call the girl's name and listen for any kind of response, but it's just this really faint crying.\nWe head in the direction of this deadfall and go around it, calling her name over and over. As we get closer to the crying, I start getting this weird feeling in my gut, and I tell my buddy that something isn't right. He tells me he feels the same way, but we can't figure out what it is. We stop where we are, and call the girl's name again. And at the same time, we both figure it out. \nThe crying is on a loop. It's the same little hitching sob, then wail, then quiet hiccup, repeated over and over. It's exactly the same every time, and without saying another word, we both take off running. It's the only time I've ever lost my composure like that, but something about it was so incredibly wrong, and neither of us wanted to stay out there anymore. \nWhen we got back to the rendezvous, we asked if anyone else had heard anything strange, but no one else knew what we were talking about. I know it sounds sort of anti-climactic, but that call fucked me up for a long time. As for the little girl, we never found a trace of her. We keep an eye out for her, and all the other people who we've never found, but frankly I doubt we'll ever find anything. \n\nOf the missing persons calls I've gone out on, only a handful have ever resulted in a complete disappearance, meaning no trace of the person and no body ever found. But sometimes, finding a body just leads to more questions than answers. Here are some of the bodies we've found that have become infamous in our team:\n\n* A teenage boy who's remains were recovered almost a year after he vanished. We found the top of his skull, two finger bones, and his camera almost forty miles from where he was last seen. The camera, sadly, was destroyed.\n\n* The pelvis of an older man who had vanished a month earlier. That was all we found. \n\n* The lower jaw and right foot of a two-year-old boy on the highest peak of a ridge in the southern part of the park. \n\n* The body of a ten-year-old girl with Down's Syndrome, almost twenty miles from where she'd vanished. She had died of exposure three weeks after going missing, and all of her clothes were intact except for her shoes and jacket. There were berries and cooked meat in her stomach when they did the autopsy. The coroner said it appeared as if someone had been taking care of her. There were no suspects ever identified.\n\n* The frozen body of a one-year-old baby, found a week after vanishing in the hollow trunk of a tree ten miles from the area he was seen last. There was fresh milk found in his stomach, but his tongue was gone.\n\n* A single vertebra and right kneecap of a three-year-old girl, found in the snow almost twenty miles from the campground her family had been at the previous summer.\n\nNow on to  a couple of the stories my friend told me. I mentioned that you were all interested in the stairs, and you're in luck: he's had a closer encounter with them. Though he doesn't have any explanation for them, he does have a bit more experience with them than I do. \n\n* My buddy has been an SAR officer for about seven years, he started when he was a junior in college, and he had a very similar experience when he first encountered the stairs. His trainer told him almost the same thing mine did, which was to never go near, touch, or ascend them. For the first year, he did just that, but apparently his curiosity got the better of him, and on one call he broke away from the line and went to go check a set of them out.\nHe said they were about ten miles from the path where a teenage girl had vanished, and the dogs were following a scent. He was on his own, lagging behind the main group, when he saw a set of stairs off to his left. They looked like they were from a new house, because the carpeting was pristine and white. He said that as he got closer, he didn't feel any different, or hear any weird noises. He was expecting something to happen, like bleeding from his ears or collapsing, but he got right up next to them and didn't feel anything. The only thing, he said, that was odd was that there was absolutely no debris on the steps. No dirt, leaves, dust, anything. And there didn't appear to be any signs of animal or insect activity in the immediate area, which he found strange. It was less like things were avoiding them, and more like they just happened to be in a relatively barren part of the forest. He touched the stairs, and didn't feel anything except that sort of sticky feeling you get from new carpet. Making sure his radio was on, he slowly climbed the stairs; he said it was terrifying, because the way they'd been stigmatized, he wasn't really sure what was going to happen to him. He joked that half of him expected to be teleported to some other dimension and the other half was watching for a UFO to come swooping down. But he got to the top with little event, and he stood there looking around. But, he said, the longer he stood on the top step, the more he felt like he was doing something very, very wrong. He described it as the feeling you'd get if you were in a part of a government building you have no business being in. As if someone was going to come and arrest you, or shoot you in the back of the head, at any second. He tried to brush it off, but the feeling got stronger and stronger, and that's when he realized that he couldn't hear anything anymore. The sounds of the forest were gone, and he couldn't hear his own breathing. It was like some kind of weird, awful tinnitus, but more oppressive. He climbed back down and rejoined the search, and didn't mention what he'd done.  \nBut, he said, the weirdest part came after. His trainer was waiting back at the welcome center after the search ended for the day, and he cornered my buddy before he could leave. He said his trainer had this look of intense anger, and he asked what was wrong.\n'You went up them, didn't you.' My buddy said it wasn't phrased as a question. He asked how his trainer knew. The trainer just shook his head.\n'Because we didn't find her. The dogs lost her scent.'\nMy buddy asked what that had to do with anything. The trainer asked how long he'd been on the stairs, and my buddy said no more than a minute. The trainer gave him this really awful, almost dead-eyed look, and told him that if he ever went up another set of stairs again, he'd be fired. Immediately. The trainer walked away, and I guess he's never answered any of the questions my buddy has asked him about it since.\n\nMy buddy has been involved in a lot of missing persons cases where there's never been a trace of them found. I mentioned David Paulides, and my buddy said he can confirm that those stories are, for the most part, accurate. He said that most of the time, if the person isn't found right away, they're either never found, or they're found weeks, months, or years later, in places they can't possibly have gotten to. One story he told me really stood out that involved a five-year-old boy with a severe mental disability.\n\n* The little boy vanished from a picnic area in the late fall. In addition to the mental disability, he was also physically handicapped, and his parents explained over and over that he simply could not have vanished. It was impossible. Someone had to have taken him. My buddy said they searched for this kid for weeks, going miles out of the accepted range, but it was like he'd never been there. The dogs couldn't pick up his scent anywhere, not even in the picnic area where he'd apparently vanished from. Suspicion fell on the parents, but it was pretty clear that they were devastated, and hadn't done anything sinister to their kid. The search was concluded about a month later, and my buddy said everyone had pretty much forgotten it by later in the winter. \nHe was out on a training op in the snow, on one of the higher peaks, when he came across something in the snow. He said he saw it from far away at first, and when he got closer, he realized it was a shirt, frozen and sticking part way out of the powder. He recognized it as belonging to the kid, because it had a distinctive pattern. About twenty yards away, he found the kid's body, laying partially buried in the snow. My buddy said there was no way the kid had been dead for any more than a few days, even though he'd been missing for almost three months. The kid was curled around something, and when my buddy brushed off the snow to see what it was, he said he almost couldn't believe what he was seeing. It was a big chunk of ice, that had been carved crudely to look sort of like a person. The kid was holding it so tight that it had frostbitten his chest and hands, which my buddy could tell even with the decay that had taken place. He radioed the rest of the crew, and they took the body off the mountain. \nNow, he recapped all of this for me, and to put it simply, there was no way this kid could have both survived for almost three months on his own, or have gotten to this peak. There was no physical way this child could have walked almost fifty miles and ended up on the top of a god damn mountain. To top it off, there was nothing in the kid's stomach or colon. Nothing, not even water. It was like, my buddy said, the kid had been taken off the face of the earth, put in suspended animation, and dropped on this mountain months later, only to die of exposure. He's never really gotten over that one.\n\nThe last story I'll share from him was one that took place relatively recently, only a few months ago. \n\n* They were out doing a recon for mountain lions, because there had been several reports of sightings in the last couple of days. One of our jobs is to scout out the areas where these animals are seen to ensure that if they are in the area, we can warn people and close off those trails. He was out on his own in a very heavily forested part of the park toward dusk when he heard what sounded like a woman screaming in the distance. Now, as most of you know, when a mountain lion screams, it sounds almost exactly like a woman being brutally murdered. It's unsettling, but far from abnormal. My buddy radioed back and let ops know that he'd heard one, and that he was going to keep going to see if he could figure out where its territory started. \nHe heard the mountain lion scream a couple more times, always from the same spot, and determined the approximate area of the mountain lion's territory. He was about to head back when he heard another scream, this time within only a few yards of him. Of course, he freaks out and starts heading back at a much faster pace, because the last thing he wants is to run into a god damn mountain lion and get mauled to death. As he got back on the path and started heading back, the screaming followed him, and he broke into a jog. When he was about a mile from ops, the screaming stopped, and he turned around to see if it was following him.\nIt was almost night by this point, but he said in the distance, just before the path rounded a corner, he could see what looked like a male figure. He called out to them, warning them that the paths were closed, and that he needed to come back to the welcome center. The figure just stood there, and my buddy started to walk over. When he was about ten yards away, the figure took, as he described, 'and impossibly long step' toward him and let out the same scream my buddy had been hearing. My buddy didn't even say anything, he just turned and sprinted back to ops, never looking behind him. By the time he got back, the screaming had moved back into the woods. He didn't mention it to anyone else, just said that there was a mountain lion in the area and that they would need to close those paths until the animal could be located and moved. \n\nI'm going to end this entry here, since it's turned into a huge wall of text. I'm going to be heading out on a yearly training op tomorrow morning, so I'll be gone until early next week. I'll be meeting with a  lot of former trainers and buddies who work in other areas of the park, and I'll be asking around about any stories they'd like to share. I'm so glad you guys have been interested in my stories, and once I'm back from this op, I'll continue to share them!\n\n**EDIT: Part 4 is up: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3jadum/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest/**",

Once I saw a ton of beer bottles, fresh beer bottles. Naturally my first thought was god damn, someone must have REALLY wanted to drink by the fire if they hiked all these beers in (it's about a day and a half from the nearest trail head with some killer climbs). I decided my next trip I was going to bring my GPS and spend a day exploring the area around the camp to see if there was another trail. I walked a spiral out from the camp, and sure enough I found a small parking area/turn around and a 4 wheel drive trail. I hiked the track down the mountain a few miles, marking spots on my GPS. When I got home I uploaded the data and spent some time on Google earth tracking back the muddy streak of the road on satellite view, found where I thought it joined the forest road and marked that intersection on my GPS.  The very next trip, I took my truck to the intersection I had saved on GPS. Couldn't find the intersection. So o got out and hiked around and finally found the trail. Ten bumpy miles and one mud recovery later, were at the campsite. That night we are chilling by the fire and three old men come out of the woods. They look like hell, it's freezing cold and windy but I had brought half a truck bed of fire wood. They are all 65+, one has a heart condition and the other is diabetic. They had been lost, run out of food and water the day before. All the diabetic had been consuming was what little water he had left and candy. I have to say, for a 65 year old diabetic who hasn't been eating and still hiking, this dude was a man with a capital F to still be hiking. As I mentioned, we are still a day and a half hike from the eastern trail head- and that's a time estimate for a young guy in good shape that hikes pretty fast. I was able to convince them to let me drive them and had them at their car at the ranger station/welcome center in an hour. So my point is, these guys were in pretty deep woods, and as OP has shown us you never know what's over that next ridge... Those guys were honestly not far from being on deaths door and I am positive that if they had camped out there in 20 degree weather in a lightweight backpacking tent they probably wouldn't have had the strength to make it back.

Years &amp; miles. Seen lots of shit. I can't explain everything I've seen in the wild but I can tell you this: you will see things out there that defy explanation &amp;, you'll spend the rest of your life wondering about them.\n\n&gt;If you ever take word of caution, take this like your life depends on it: Don't go into the wild alone. Don't stray from your camp at night. Don't answer or seek out anything that calls you mysteriously in the night. DO NOT believe everything you see with your own eyes.\n\n&gt;I need to repeat that, Like your life depends on it: Do not believe things, especially 'out of place' 'people', voices, or suspicious things that you see, even with your own eyes, especially when your gut &amp; instincts are warning you.\n\n&gt;There's something out there, something that scares grown men even like me, something we won't talk about but it's real, has no consistent form, and it lures you.\n\n&gt;If you are a wild thing &amp; a hunter of human beings, there's no better hunting ground than our busiest national &amp; state parks. Note I said busisest. If you are a hunter of opportunity, then there's no better prey than the young, the weak, the old, the alone.\n\n&gt;There's something out there, so old, so skilled, so clever &amp; cunning, not just a being but a species, that has or have developed a specialized survival skill: luring &amp; preying on lost or solitary humans.\n\n&gt;Can a predator in the natural world lure, trap, summon or even hypnotize their prey? A quick google search should yield you hundreds of examples of such species in the animal, fish, bird, and insect kingdoms.\n\n&gt;What I submit, if exist such a species, old as man, who's success depended on the successful hunting of humans, not only would it be very clever and good at it by now, but we'd have no record or memory of it in our history, just as no insect has probably ever survived an encounter with a trapdoor spider.\n\n&gt;I submit their hunting approach is case by case. They're lure different depending on their human prey's age, strength and size, but what I submit is that our oldest natural predator, an undiscovered predator, is still opperating due to it's skill of being able to read us like a book, hit us with lure (a lure I've distinctly recognized several times, particularly at night, just beyond the glow of the campfire) lead us into a trap, to never be seen or heard from again.\n\n&gt;People I submit a thing exists, something's out there, a species, that's not too unlike Stephen King's \"It\".\n\n&gt;I've felt the lure, tasted it, smelled it. It's the smell of food when you're hungry, company when you're lonely, music where there should be none, beauty where there's danger. Nothing can explain the sensations, but deep down you'll feel it, in your gut. Something's not right. Something's waiting. Something's watching. Ask any man who's survived long enough alone in the wild. There's a Siren like hunter out there. It'll own you dead to rights, if you don't listen to your gut.\n\n&gt;Having said that. I have questions. These stairs, do they move? There one minute, gone the next? Do others always see them? Or are they visible only to 'targets'? Do they see stairs? Or for them are the stairs another lure, like an apple pie, a warm bed, something to surrender to?\n\n&gt;What I'm getting at are these stairs def sound like the work of the It. A cave or door might be to scary to enter, but stairs, a perfect lure for the \"Search\" &amp; rescue mindset. Perhaps the vison of stairs are perfectlyt taylored to what's on 'your' frame of mind. \"If I could only find some higher ground to spot that lost kid. If only I had a ladder or a...\"\n\n&gt;See what I mean?\n",

I had lots of dogs on the farm I grew up with. They were everyone's dogs really but they always traveled with me. I remember several distinct times I would be far up in the woods playing/riding dirt bikes/exploring and everything would be going great. Then all of a sudden I would get this dangerous feeling in my gut like I was being watched and the dogs would start growling. At this point I would trust my instincts and GTFO but the whole time I was heading back down to my house or my grandpas house I felt like something was coming after me. I have no explaination for it whether it was real or not, but I definitely remember those times and it was giving me the absolute shivers reading some of these stories last night. My only unexplained story where I actually saw a being was when I was around 13 or 14 my parents were out for the night and I was at home watching my brother and sisters. My house was actually situated way up in the woods so we were in the forest. I remember sitting inside the house and getting that instinctual feeling of impending danger/doom. I checked all around the house making sure all the doors were locked checking every window. The sun was starting to set and I really didn't like how I was feeling in my gut. I remember going to my sisters room and looking out the window(she was on the 2nd floor of our house) when I looked down I saw a dark figure in our yard making its way around our house. Scared the living shit out of me. I hightailed it to my dad's room went to his closet grabbed his loaded 12 gauge and sprinted back to my sisters window. Looked down whatever was there was gone. Sprinted all around the house looking out every window, every door. Keep in mind it took me around 30 seconds to get my dads gun but whatever was moving around our house was gone. Naturally being freaked out by this and being young and stupid I opened a window and screamed my defiance at whatever was out there. It didn't matter because it was definitely gone, but the strangest thing is that my dogs weren't around and they almost always were when we were home. I called for them and they came running out of the woods maybe 5 minutes later panting like they had been running a long way chasing something. ",

They actually have a name for \"It\" -- they call them the Aluxes. They're basically demon/sprites that own the forest...except they're actually the real deal. I'm neither spiritual nor religious but at one point while I was in a Mayan village I asked a question about a nice clearing not too far away in the middle of the forestry. Wouldn't it be nice to visit there?\n\n\nThey explained to me that that belonged to the aluxes and they do not respond well to people entering their space. Two young macho villagers tell me that they're going to go out there with me since 'they're not afraid,' and off we trek. When we arrive to the edge of the clearing, they refuse to enter, and in fact, physically prohibit me from exploring it without them. When I ask them why they're being such sissies about the whole thing, they tell me to wait. So we stand. And we wait -- for about 30-45 minutes I'd estimate. As I'm starting to get really steamed and thinking they're screwing with me -- voices start. The voices begin calling back and forth to each other, talking and conversing. Those voices were definitely not human.\n\n\nNeedless to say, I never gave my host mother grief whenever she left her offering of tortillas under my hammock for the aluxes. ",

As i walking away i could hear something following me which was also making a talking nosie so i sped up the pase of my walking but then the whatever it was somehow was infront of me and i could feel a push from it that was oushing me back to the farm house so i turned right at a 90 degree angle and walked for a while and i could still hear the thing to my left so i decided that i should face the what ever it was and walked directly uphill to the fire track. as i did the the thing moved it self right infront of me and the sounds it was making were getting louder but they were at such a low pitch that i couldn't really hear them but i knew it was a voice and as i walked towards it it got louder and the voice felt panicked and frantic i got with 5 meters of the noise and it was so loud it hurt and made everything around me vibrate i could even see the vibration in my water bottle. At this point my nose was bleeding and it was really freaking me out but i needed to get home so i ran at it and i burst into a 2 meter wide clearing that had a very disfigured stag ( a fallow deer) in the center which had pure white glowing eyes with black dots in the middle and when i looked into those dots everything went black and i started falling and i passed out. i woke up from what i could tell was quite a while later but i couldn't see very well and i was under something so i pulled it off and it was a blue tarp and i was in the barn that was next to the barn. Now i was really freaked out and i ran outside and again i was at the farm house. I then ran up the hill towards the ridge and i could hear something chasing me so i ran fast as i could up the hill. I ran for ages with this thing following me i eventually came to a information board that is 1 km from the dirt road that heads into the nearest village. I ran even harder and faster and i made it to the road where 2 hikers were packing away their stuff so i stopped next to them and i was absolutely rooted and puffed by this point and the hikers looked really concerned about me and they moved towards me and i blacked out again. I woke up with my head in the lap of a lovely german woman who was trickling Gatorade into my mouth. i asked her how long i'd been out and she said i'd only been out for 5 minutes she then asked me why i was running and what i was running from. i told her i was running because something was chasing me and i didn't know what it was to which she laughed and told me i was being silly. i then asked her what the time is and why they were packing up in the morning to which she was astounded because it was 4:37pm which freaked the crap out of me because when i found the house it was only 11:00am so i must of been out in that barn for over 4 hours of which i can't remember and i some how was moved from where i saw the freaky deer thing to the barn which was over 1km away.\nI've been back to the barn with a friend and we got the weird talking again as well as the red vision and metallic taste when we walked towards the house. We checked the barn and found the tarp as well as my foot prints and what looked like something had been dragged in and i am not sure if that was me or something else. We then left as fast as we could with no problems and we've never gone back there nor do i ever plan too.",

I would typically walk or ride my bicycle the three miles between my house and the camp. When I walked, I would cut through the woods, because it cut about fifteen minutes off the hike.\n\nOne day, I was hiking home through the woods and thought I heard something in the trees over my head. I assumed it was a bird or squirrel or something, and kept walking. But the sounds seemed to follow me. It started to really creep me out.\n\nI was tempted to look up, but the more creeped out I got, the more reluctant I was to look. A friend of my fathers had lived and worked for years on a Choctaw reservation down south, and had told me stories of spirits and creatures that lived in the woods. All these horrible stories were running through my head when I head a series of tremendous crashes down the tree immediately to my right.\n\nI screamed (and might have peed a bit) as a dark ball of something landed directly beside me. The ball hopped up and unrolled into the most pissed off (and probably clumsiest) raccoon I've ever seen. It hissed and glared at me while I stood, shocked. After a moment, I said to the raccoon, \"I'm... I'm just gonna go that way,\" and pointed in my direction of travel. And I did.\n\nThat's the scariest thing that's ever happened to me in the woods.",

This didn't occur to me as an issue until I got up just now and headed to the kitchen and stopped... because the rooms ahead were dark (I like to save power) and the windows were open (to cool the apartment), and the *sound* of wilderness was so completely and loudly filling my home that it drove home *there are NO barriers between me and anything out there!*\n\nThis thought is banging around in my head IN MY OWN HOME! My \"safe place\"! I guess this is a \"lite\" taste of how people feel scared of their home after a burglary. Nice work. :)\n\nSo I steeled myself, strode into the dark and quickly shut the windows... and locked them.\n\nThere really is just a pane of glass between me and miles and miles of wilderness. I'm told there are mountain lions out there, and I've often heard a bone-chilling shrieking cacophony of a vast wolf-pack of demon hell-hounds, but it's probably just coyotes (I don't have much experience with American wilderness). I've heard stranger things that I have no clue what they are, including a purring clicking right out of \"Predator\", plus various things I can happily identify - owls, turkeys, etc. On multiple occasions, on the computer in the dark, I've heard a bone-crunching *chewing* coming from the darkness on the other side of those panes of glass. As in, three or four feet from my head, something is *crunching*. Loudly. I've always happily assumed that it's Bambi chowing down on some yummy shrubs or grass - there are a lot of deer around here, and I bet a ruminent chewing plant sounds a lot louder and more grisly than I'd expect, probably more like what I'd imagine crunching bones to sound like, so it's totally a deer. Once I put my phone (the only light-emitting device nearby) to the window and took a photo to find out. The flash reflecting off stuff or me looking at the bright phone screen meant I couldn't see anything in the blackness outside the window, and the photo likewise came out black... except for a flash reflection off some kind of eye. So I didn't actually learn anything but happily continued assuming it was a deer's eye, but when this happens in the future, after tonight...?\n\nDamnit.\n\nTime to board up those windows like it's the zombie apocalypse! :D\n\nOh crap, I didn't even think about that - those crunching-chewing sounds would be creepy-as-fuck FX for a zombie gnawing on a corpse.",

That happens on occasion and it makes me want to shit my pants. I can just feel something out there when it gets quiet. The worst part is when i hear my dogs abruptly stop barking. I turn on all lights in the house get out my rifle and just sit listening and waiting. Thatrmoment of peace when the crickets come back and the dogs bark again is more relieving than anything else in the world. ",

Then all of a sudden I woke up, it was just a feeling that  I had, something primitive. Then all the forest sounds simply came to a halt, all the bugs, frogs, etc.. simply shut the fuck up about 2 minutes after I woke up, that was creepy in itself. The next thing I knew there was a blood curdling scream, like a women screaming at the top of her lungs like she is being murdered, but with quite a demonic tone behind it. It was near my camp site and it would scream to the right of me, and the next thing I knew it screamed in front of me, then behind me. I didn't hear any steps or movement of something outside, but the screams came from different place every time. Then all of the sudden the forest came busting back to life and the frogs, crickets, etc.. were going full force, almost like they were being as loud as they could to help forget about what just happened. Shit was freaky. This whole time I thought it was a Bobcat or a Puma, but now... who the fuck knows.\n\n  The other time I was camping way deep in the Appalachian mountains with my dogs, like 10 miles to walk in any direction to get to any kind or forest service road. Same kinda thing happened. I was having a good old time by the camp fire late at night (just me and my dog) when all of a sudden I got this strange feeling  and my dog tucked her tail and sat right next to me. The next thing I knew I started hearing this weird ass noise, like something one would hear from star trek or something. It sounded like something you would hear when a portal would open from the movies, like a loud buzzing, humming type of noise, but nothing like electrical lines or anything like that, its hard to explain.  It lasted only about 3-4 seconds ever time it happened, but it happened again and again. It sounded like it was directly on top of me, but I couldn't see shit when I looked up. But the sound its self almost gave its self body, like it was tangible  and I could touch it. It is hard as hell to explain, but that's pretty much as accurate as a description as I can give. This went on for about 5 minutes, and my dog was doing the whole slanting her head way to the side every time the sound started and looked up at the exact same place I looked, which was directly over my head. I swear I could have reached up and touched the sound. After the sound went away I went to sleep and was woken up at about 3 in the morning with the largest pack of coytoes I have ever fucking heard howling at the moon. They literally encircled my tent and just straight howled their fucking lungs out for a good 30 minutes, it scared the fuck out of me. Their had to have been about 20 of them minimum. I could see their silhouettes right outside the tent because the moon was bright as hell. It was actually neat to have witnessed the coyotes singing to the night, but was weird that both those things happened in the same night.",

I think I was around twelve when it happened. I was on a hike in the Ozarks (or somewhere around there) with my mom, dad, and then-nine-year-old brother. My family is usually really frickin slow on hikes, so it seems like I'm always ahead. (Thanks to this series, that won't be an issue anymore.) I was sitting on a rock, waiting patiently for them to catch up, when a rock or a branch or some shit suddenly decides to fall and make an extremely loud noise. There's absolute silence for maybe ten seconds. It felt like an eternity. The wind seemed to stop blowing. I didn't even breathe. It was one of the most eerie things I've ever experienced. Then, the forest spontaneously continues its noises and I begin to breathe again. At exactly the same time. It was really cool and really creepy. Silence has a bigger impact than people take it for.

            "comment": "I know this is a place for scary stories. My story isn't conventionally scary, but it is true, and it relates to the ones posted in this thread in that it takes place in the woods, and involves the unexplained.\n\nI live in a suburb that sprung up around an old copper mine. The mine has been abandonned for a few decades, so I've only ever known it as strange undergrowth peppered with concrete ruins. \n\nLike many local children, I grew up on the mine. Some of our parents didn't like us playing there and the place had a bad reputation. The exact nature of that bad reputation depends on whom you ask: some opined (rightly) that the soil was dangerously polluted; others thought the ruins were frequented by the criminal element; a few talked about some kind of Native American bogeyman.\n\nUnlike most of my friends who grew up and moved away, I stayed home for college, so I kept visiting the mine. I would go there for brisk walks, usually around dusk. \n\nI'd frequently run into three or four deer. One autumn night, after I climbed a steep hill overlooking a clearing, I came upon twelve of them -- exactly twelve deer, all of them mature specimens. I thought it was an oddly large herd, but I fully expected them to disperse as I walked down the path through the clearing. Except they didn't. They stood stock-still,  not only unafraid but seemingly oblivious to my presence.\n\nWhen I got to the center of the clearing, I noticed they were all facing east, looking into a dense section of forest that's older than the mine. I intuitively looked in the same place, and I felt something there. I can't say that I \"saw\" anything, because it was rather indistinct, though not \"obscured\" so much as actually blurry. It was something like a shadow where there could not have been a shadow  -- in the direct light of the setting sun -- and it felt like the shape and presence of a giant.\n\nWhen I noticed the presence at the edge of the woods, I began to feel as though I'd interrupted an ancient ritual to which I should not have been privy. I think I ran away at that point, but to be honest, everything after the realization that there was an impossible thing in the woods is a bit of a blur. I vaguely recall that the deer eventually ran off each in their own direction, and that their step seemed unaturally swift.\n\nI wanted to tell everyone but I soon found that I couldn't. Months later, I was able to talk to a friend who was asking around for stories for a pagan zine. I can't actually account for my silence in the interim. It just didn't feel at all like an appropriate topic.\n\nJust to be clear: I'm a fairly down-to-earth guy; I have an interest in religion and myth, but I have for long considered that these things are more or less \"made up.\" The giant at the edge of the woods is the only exception in my otherwise perfectly cartesian mindset. Maybe it was the Internet-famous Goatman? My first intuition was to tie this experience with the Celtic Cernunnos, because it was the closest thing I knew from mythology that matched the vibe I got from the presence. ",

            "comment": "I used to volunteer at a State Park in Oklahoma, and I always got spooked by the stories the older park rangers would tell me.  Since everyone is especially spooked by the story of the luring crying, and the stairs, here is one relating them.  From the perspective of the older ranger who told me the story, he was a younger vet in the 90's when he came across a structure that looked like the bottom floor of house. A floor of wood about 8x8 that looked well crafted for being out in fuck of nowhere, with a chair and table on it. He approached it until he heard his CO calling out to him, but when he turned around he saw him yelling with all his strength. He ran back and the CO told him that it's a common trap used by the fucked up people in the world to catch someone. They use familiar objects to prey on wanderers, because they feel comfortable near them, or in the case of stairs they look like good vantage points to see what direction civilization is.  What made the floor particularly crazy is that it was put in a sort of natural bowl in which the acoustics blanketed all noise with a layer of \"white noise,\" making it so you can't hear anyone approaching. He said the next week his CO brought in the proper authorities to blow the damn thing up.\n\nThe story did not end there.  They went to check the site immediately after (to make sure there was no way in hell a fire could start) and in the middle of where the floor had been, they saw three or four holes near where the table and chair was. Now due to the explosion the holes had caved in, but the authorities said that with some of the wood they collected, it was possible that near the table and chairs, thinner wood was used to where they could fall through into the holes. They didn't find anything in the holes after digging them up again, but from how different the densities in the soil was, they could tell that the holes were built to be about six feet deep.\n\nMoral of the story, animals aren't the only hunters out there.  If you see something too unnatural or too perfect to be true, don't instagram it, run.",

For those of you who know umass, that time of night still usually has a lot of kids walking around, particularly near the southwest dorms which around where we were. However there was no one else around us, and at one point in our walk home we all noticed a figure standing about 100-125 yards away from us. This \"person\" was extremely tall, had to be at least 7 foot 6, and just kind of a dark blurr with no distinguishable face which didn't make sense because we really weren't that far away. We all stopped to look at this thing, who all of a sudden seemed to start moving backwards, and then at the same instant starting taking massive steps towards us. These steps it was taking were at least 10-12 feet long because in just a few seconds it was already way closer to us than it should have been, and it was not running, just taking absolutely massive steps. Now at this point it gets even weirder, which could just be a coincidence but the timing is bizarre, and keep in mind this all happened in the span of a few seconds.\n\nJust after it starting taking its steps towards us, we all freaked out and started to run away. A couple of seconds later we hear this deafening explosion, loud enough to be heard throughout the entire (massive) campus. This caused us to turn around, where the thing that was walking towards us had dissapeared. We were on the outskirts of a parking lot and it would have been impossible for a normal person to get out of our view from where this thing was in the amount of time that this all happened. Extremely rattled, and glad the thing was gone, we all went home and went to bed. The next morning we all woke up to an email from the Umass administration telling us that there had been \"some sort of accident at one of the science buildings last night resulting in a very loud explosion\", but that there was nothing to worry about.\n\nAs I said before the explosion and this thing walking towards us could have been completely unrelated, but the timing was just so weird it scared the shit out of all of us.

            "comment": "I don't think OP has stressed this enough, but the message is pretty clear: DO NOT GO ON HIKING, CAMPING, OR BACKPACKING TRIPS ALONE. \n\nAlways have a buddy/buddies, tell someone when you are leaving, where you are going, who else is going with you, what time/day you plan to return, and what to do/who to call if you don't come back on time. \n\nI don't have any particularly frightening tales from my times when I've worked at boy scout camps and roamed the Ouachita National Forest, but I do have a story to back up my statement I made above. A friend and I had planned a Spring Break backpacking trip into the Ozark Mountains along the Buffalo river valley in the western part of the state. What we failed to realize was that the weather was as bad, if not worse, than it had been the previous year, when a group of campers had been flooded, overwhelmed, and drowned by a rapid rise in the water level of the Buffalo River. \n\nOn the second day we were out, we probably hiked around 11 miles and came to a stopping point on a well-established trail about 3/4ths of a mile from the river and atop a ridge that was easily 30 to 40 feet above the water level of the river. \n\nWe made camp, cooked some food, and climbed into our tent for the night at around 8:45 or 9:00 PM. I woke up at about 2:30 AM freezing and wet, and realized that loose items in the tent were either completely soaked or *floating* in about 2 inches of water that had crept through the tent flap. Then I heard the rushing sound of swift water moving past our campsite no more than 30 feet from the tent. \n\nI got out of the tent and saw that the river had risen *at least* 25 feet in the time between us calling it a night and our startled awakening. We broke camp, gathered what trash and gear we could that wasn't submerged or actively floating away, and made for the trail head that was about a mile distant. \n\nThis is all a very long story to make a very short point, I apologize. But when we made it back to the trail head that led to a bridge crossing the river, we realized just how much danger we had just escaped from; the river was flowing *over* the footbridge leading back to the parking area and the only place on the trail head and it's small picnic grounds that wasn't filled with water were the unisex latrine huts. My friend and I spent a very cold, damp night sleeping next to a literal shit hole, waiting for the water to recede so we could get back to my truck.\n\nHad I been alone on the trip, like I had been planning to be originally, things could have gone very differently. I don't know if I was more alert that night because I subconsciously knew that I needed to keep my friend alive, as well as myself, but I am sure glad he was there with me, and that we told people where we were going and when we planned to be back. \n\nTL;DR: always have a contingency plan that will allow people to begin looking for you if you go missing in the woods. Communicate, communicate, communicate. ",

            "comment": "Firstly I'd like to thank the OP for the fascinating, and disturbing, glimpses he has offered us into the nature of the wilderness out there. It brought to mind a quote, originally penned by Shakespeare but also quoted by Major Briggs to his son Bobby in Twin Peaks, which seems most apt, since clearly something akin to the Black Lodge is at play here: There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\n\nAnd it strikes with a particular resonance with me. I grew up in the Cotswold Hills, old country, old forests, as evidenced by the stone cricles you can find regularly. As a teenager I used to hand around with new age travellers and all of them had strange tails of creatures seen in the woods, or occasionally on isolated roads. Golem-like creatures, or short hairy men being the two most consistent.\n\nBut one time I saw something, something strange. It would have been around 3am, driving home from a friends in village called Painswick. I was on a very isolated lane that passes through Cranham Woods, old forest, the wyldwood that has a reputation for the odd occurance. I have told this story many times and always it has been dismissed, but given the discussion here I think it's worth re-telling. As I said I was driving along and either something caught my eye, or something caused to look to my right. There, beyond the tree line were two objects I can only describe as eyes. Except they were about the size of a tennis balls and they glowed white, a luminescence more than a genuine light. Before I'm told they were animal eyes caught in the headlights and reflecting them back, these were back from the road and square on to me, beyond the tree line and out of my lights. I may have dismissed them had I not looked to the other side of the road and seen the exact same phenomena, again back from the treeline and out of the lights. I have no explanation for what I saw except I have never felt a sense of dread like it. It gives me goosebumps even now to tell it. I just remember flooring the accelerator and getting the hell of there. Now reading these stories, and that comment from an experienced backpacker about something being out there, preying on lost or lone humans in the wild, that I saw something similar.\n\nI think it was automatic reaction that makes me believe I saw something otherworldly: there was a sense of wrongness, a knowledge that I was in the presence of something that raised a essential, primordial fear in me. \n\nAnyway, thanks OP for the stories.",

Two minutes on the stairs might make time change for the entity with the kidnapped child. That's why the dogs lost track of the girl. Stepping on the the stairs created a time shift two minutes = three weeks etc. That is why the alive/deceased person ends up miles away and found days to weeks later. They are temporarily on a different plane/time of existence. They might only find bones and a piece of shirt because they are hundreds of years into the future/past.\n\nMy other theory is that the stairs are actually a circuit (wormhole). When the entity enters our dimension it does not have a way back to where it came from. When someone gets close enough to the stairs it creates a new portal. It needs two humans to complete the circuit. If lucky the entity gets both humans. The portal could also be a trap to just grab one unsuspecting person. \n\nThe stairs are always a trap no matter what theory you believe.\n\nThat is how the supervisor knew he had messed with the stairs. Some higher ups know much more about these things and the stairs. These things either possess some form of technology we have no idea about or they are legendary fairy creatures from our folklore that our ancestors were scared of. We discount them because we have been made to believe they don't exist.\n\n",

These have captured my attention more than any other recent reddit posts out there.\n\nI too have encountered weird stairs but not as similar to the ones posted here.  \n\nI grew up in a small town in SE Nebraska along the Missouri river.  In high school my friends and I tried to investigate all of the local lores and stories of ghosts/etc.  On one of our outings we found abandoned ruins of a farmstead back in the woods on the bluff overlooking the river.  \n\nOn the property we stumbled upon a well engineered brick staircase leading down into the ground vs. up like the ones posted here.  This stair case was separate from the house ruins on a random part of the property.  They went down into the ground for what I remember of at least 3 flights.  We couldn't descend any further due to water filling the rest of the decent.  But I can remember the most horrid sense of dread while going down those stairs (sounds going away, time slipping, our flashlights going in and out).  Needless to say we didn't stick around for too long.  We never made it back, but I would guess they still might exist.\n\nIt was one of the most eerie locations we every visited.  Perhaps it was the location of a local lore passed down regarding an old steamboat captain who built a house on the bluff and who supposedly built an underground stairway/tunnel from the bluff top to the river bank.",

These dogs were whining at something outside - not barking, just whimpering. Something had them spooked and these were dogs who would usually bark if provoked.\n\nMy friend and her family members couldn't see anything on the ground so they went out there with flashlights to check out things and my friend looked up in the treeline on one side of the house to see something leaping, almost gliding, soaring, from treetop to treetop. She described it as vaguely human-shaped and white and big and bulky. Despite being big it was only just disturbing the trees it was leaping to, barely causing any branches to stir. Her relations saw it too and they all ran into the house. Whatever it was, they figured it was gone when several minutes later the dogs stopped their whimpering. They waited until it was light to go out and check though. They couldn't find a trace of anything on the ground, nothing disturbed, but they were sure they did see something  up there because whatever the white thing was had been caught in their flashlight beams and it certainly looked like something solid.

The funny thing as a kid I felt invincible as most kids do and never was afraid to go out on my own exploring. Now as an adult who has been city-fied I'd be wary of being off in the woods by myself\n\nAs far as your scariest experience I've had a similar thing happen here in Long Beach, CA. One day I was outside my local coffee shop when out of nowhere the loudest sound I've every heard came blasting from all directions. The sound was instantly recognizable as a jet engine of military variety or so I thought. The only problem was that it wasn't coming from above, it was distinctly at ground level and in the immediate vicinity, not a faraway echo from the nearest airport which was 5-7 miles away. I looked around and while I saw a few curious faces no one seemed alarmed by this deafening sound that drowned out everything else. After about 30 seconds it cut off as quickly as it started and everyone started up their conversations as if nothing happened, just kept on like a Zach from Saved By the Bell un-paused the scene. I'm a bit of an avgeek so I know planes, they're sounds from close and far away. I've been close to 747s as the take off and theirs is a dull roar and this was a higher pitched roar. Even though I knew the answer I still emailed the local paper if they A) Heard the sound and B) Were F-18s on maneuvers out of Long Beach Airport as was fairly common. I got a quick reply and the answe was no to both. Also I'd like to mention this was not a stucco machine spraying houses. Living in SoCal my whole life I know that high pitched whine and it was not that. Besides it was much much louder and as I said before coming from what seemed like all directions. Anyway to this day I still don't know what it was and kind of creeps me out.",

            "comment": "I would love to hear your advice on how to mange this fear.\n\nI only felt the fear once. I was in a state park in Missouri and was doing a short day hike. The main attraction was caves and I saw at least a dozen people in the area. I decided to do a loop trail that I ended up not seeing anyone else on. Not too long after starting I started to feel very uneasy. It felt like I was being watched, or someone else was there but I couldn't see them. There wasn't particularly dense growth but it was karst topography, meaning there were plenty of dips and little knolls. The feeling never left and I continued to glance behind me frequently the rest of the way. \n\nI imagine this fear works in a feedback loop: I unconsciously pick up on something unusual and it kicks in that eerie/uneasy fear or doubt. Then I start to find more scary/odd things because I'm looking for it. The uneasiness grows until I'm uncomfortable and on high alert. From that point forward I'm convinced there's a murderer watching me. \n\nI know these responses keep us safe but it is also important to stay calm. I really liked the comment about not trusting everything we hear and see. We've got to maintain the function of rational thought for that to occur. How do you manage that? Is there anything you tell yourself or do? ",

We are dropped on the island with anything more than a army knife, a canteen of 50cl of fresh water and our army wear (it is a tough exercise but i love it.. it makes me defy my limitations).. We must do the entire exercise alone (yeah, we cannot group away with our comrades).. So i was that night in the middle of a motherfucking dense florest island carving out my shelter for the night while starting a fire to cook out some rat like animal i could catch earlier.. Everything was ok, when i decide it was time to go searching for some fresh water and call it the day.. Was wandering about and marking out the places for orientation when from nothing i see a freaking staircase in the middle of a forest whe always knew it was closed to construction and for military exercises only for various countrys... I never felt such striking sensation down my spine like that.. I approched to verify wtf was that doing there when the odd part of it striked out.. the staircase was freaking clean and shiny eventough there was a tree right above (for a moment my brain was thinking how the hell the falling leafs never stayed right above the object below..).. Im a person who doesnt believe in ghosts, ets, conspirations, religions etc, i believe in my eyes merely.. When i proceed to put my feet up on the staircase i felt a sensation of warning, it was like my brain was crying out loud to gtfo but curious like i am i ignored and tried to check it out better when i start to feel nauseous and start to notice all the around sounds start to fade away, i panicked and run like for 5 miles without looking back... If it was a emergency call to roll out the exercise i would without think call it off.. Wtf i was trough by? What was that? \n\nWhen the exercise went over, i moved to the extract point still blank like snown and acting weird to those comrades i live day by day all the year.. When i talked about everything they laughed and said i was crazy because being alone on the forest for 3 days (but i knewn it was true.. i did this same exercise 3 times before and always going by well done).. To this day, i feel way too much afraid to go in forest and see those staircases alikes again... Sorry for the bad english.. I dont get to speak it so much..",

            "comment": "These large figures making guttural  \"meow\", and wails/screams/other assorted types of sounds are quite consistent with what sasquatches are said to make.\n\n\nI've even read specific reports where phonetic sounds such as \"meow\", and other gibberish type \"words\" are heard. Even straight imitation of people and animals. Sometimes it seems they have their own true language. \n\nThey will also make these sounds whilst approaching, as a \"warning.\" Other times seemingly making sounds to themselves as they traipse around. I listened to one account where a man was accosted and bothered by a female Sasquatch that he believes was either extremely distressed over the loss of its child, or just mentally ill. Acting exactly like a schizophrenic/schizo-affective individual, muttering, random wails, pacing; odd, stereotypic repetitive actions and movements.\n\n\nAnyway, I digress. This shit is interesting, and terrifying. Some sasquatch are gentle with the children they take, often times returning them. Others are still gentle, but keep them, some theorize these females could not have a child, or lost one. Some males try to kidnap children either for prey, or to possibly present to their/a potential mate. ",

I figured I should add my story to the mix also since the wonderful OP has inspired everyone to share theirs!\n\nI rockhound a lot. Topaz Mountain is one of my favorite spots to go-it is in the west desert area of Utah and this area is super desolate and as empty as can be. I went during the first weekend when spring started to warm up when this happened, so we were the only group out there that I saw besides a couple and their dogs.\nAnyways, the first night I go out to pee. The moon was full so I didn't bother taking my headlamp. No one else is awake by this time. I pop a squat and then afterwards I walk up the small hill that our camp is at the base of, to admire the clear sky for a minute.\n\nThis humanoid figure was fairly far away, down the hill and across a large gully/washout. It was really tall and not skinny, but pretty wide and robust. I wondered if it was a weird tree with the shape of a head and body, however it moved after I stared at it for a few seconds and seemed to be walking around. I didn't really know what to make of it and I was still half asleep. I turned around and fast walked/shambled down the hill awkwardly and back to my tent. I only got super freaked out once I was trying to fall back asleep. I nearly shit myself when I heard shuffling and sniffing noises right outside my tent. I know it was probably an antelope or coyote making the sounds, still couldn\u2019t sleep most of that night though.\nDeserts can be scary too!\n",

            "comment": "This is what I've been able to piece together from OP's last 3 posts. \n\n- OP's provided reports of sinister \"figures\" in the area he works, responsible for terrorizing visitors and - quite possibly - abducting young children. Each report varies slightly but there are some striking similarities. Children tend to report a \"big/tall man\" with a \"funny/weird/scary\" face, who takes one of them away (little boys in these cases). There are two adult reports as well; a young woman who reported a \"hairy, big man with black eyes\" was following her, and an injured climber who claimed to have been frightened by a \"man with no face\". \n\n- \tThe parents initially thought their sons had wandered off; in both cases the girls claimed the boy had been taken away by the man. The children are described as calm during these encounters, as if they\u2019ve been drugged.\n\n&gt; \u2026when we asked where her brother was, she told us that he'd been taken away by 'the bear man.' She said he gave her berries and told her to stay quiet, that he wanted to play with her brother for a while. The last she saw of her brother, he was riding on the shoulders of 'the bear man' and seemed calm\u2026\n\n&gt; \u2026Her kids are walking in front of her, when she hears what sounds like someone coming up the path behind her. She turns around, and in the four or so seconds she's not looking, her five-year-old son vanishes. She figures he's stepped off the trail to pee or something, and she asks her other two where he went. They both tell her that 'a big man with a scary face' came out of the woods next to them, took the kid's hand, and led him into the trees. The two remaining kids don't seem upset, in fact she says later that it seems like they've been drugged. They're sort of spacey and fuzzy\u2026\n\n&gt; \u2026He said the guy had no climbing equipment, and he was wearing a parka and ski pants. He walked up to the guy, and when the guy turned around, he said he had no face. It was just blank. He freaked out, and ended up trying to get off the mountain too fast, which is why he'd fallen. He said he could hear the guy all night, climbing down the mountain and letting out these horrible muffled screams\u2026\n\n- I believe it's possible these are all reports of one person...or thing, which I will refer to as the \"Bear Man\"\n\n- in some of the most unusual cases missing victims have been found stashed in areas (trees, cliffs, etc.) they could not possibly have reached on their own, far from where they'd disappeared. In all cases they were found dead from exposure, yet strangely had no injuries and seemed to have died only days before (despite having been missing or weeks or months). In every case these victims have been children, and appear to have been cared for.\n\n&gt; ..the body of a 10 year old girl with Downs Syndrome\u2026found 20 miles from her campsite\u2026cooked meat and berries found in her stomach, as if someone was caring for her\n\n&gt; \u2026Not only was this kid 15 miles from where he'd started, there was no possible way he could have gotten up there on his own. \n\n&gt; My buddy said there was no way the kid had been dead for any more than a few days, even though he'd been missing for almost three months\u2026There was no physical way this child could have walked almost fifty miles and ended up on the top of a god damn mountain\n\n- canines were also unable to pick up the victims' scent, and their shoes were missing (as if they'd been carried; interestingly the young woman OP rescued was missing her shoes). \n\n&gt; ...You went up them, didn't you.' My buddy said it wasn't phrased as a question. He asked how his trainer knew. The trainer just shook his head. 'Because we didn't find her. *The dogs lost her scent.*'\u2026\n\n&gt; \u2026My buddy said they searched for this kid for weeks, going miles out of the accepted range, but it was like he'd never been there. *The dogs couldn't pick up his scent anywhere*, not even in the picnic area where he'd apparently vanished from... \n\n&gt; \u2026*Canines can't pick up any scent*, we don't find any clothing or broken bushes or literally anything that would signify a child being there\u2026\n\n&gt; Not only that, but the kid doesn't have a scratch on him. *His shoes are gone, but his feet aren't damaged or dirty\u2026*\n\n- those who\u2019ve encountered \u201cBear Man\u201d report it imitating unusual sounds, seemingly to taunt or lure its victims; OP's friend reported it imitating a mountain lion/screaming woman; the victim who was pushed off the cliff likewise reported it as screaming, but its speech was \u201cmuffled\u201d (maybe because it doesn\u2019t have a mouth). We have two reports that the figure\u2019s speech sounded flat, almost monotone, as if it came from an electrolarnyx (the cat\u2019s meow\u201d, and the tape-recording of the crying girl). In two cases the OP and an older woman described this voice as having a buzzing quality - similar to an insect or tinnitus. OP personally has described it having come from \"all directions at once\" - in the case of the \"cat\" and the \"rhythmic, coughing noise\" it made when he rescued that young woman\n\n&gt; \"It wasn't a cat. It was a man, saying the word 'meow' over and over. Just 'meow, meow, meow'. But it wasn't a man, it couldn't have been, because I've never heard a man make his voice buzz like that. I thought my hearing aid was going out, but it wasn't, I adjusted it and *it still sounded all buzzy.*\n\n&gt; but it sounded exactly like a man saying 'meow, meow' in this really odd monotone... I go off the trail in the direction I think it's coming from, but I never seem to get closer. *It's almost like it's coming from all directions.*\n\n- Then there's a tenuous connection between Bear Man and the staircases. Our only account of what the staircases actually do comes from OP's buddy, however, his account practically matches up with one from another search. \n\n&gt;\u2026We freeze and look at each other, and there's almost a sensation like a plane depressurizing. My ears pop, and I have this odd sensation of having dropped about ten feet. I start to ask my buddy if he felt that, but before I can, we hear the loudest sound I've ever heard in my life. It's almost like a freight train passing directly by us, but it's coming from *every direction at once*, including above and below us. He screams something to me, but I can't hear him over this deafening roar. Understandably freaked out, we look all around us, trying to find the source of the sound, but neither of us sees anything...The sound goes on and on... we can't hear anything but this sound. Then, as suddenly as it starts, it stops, like someone threw a switch and cut it off... slowly the normal sounds of the woods come back\u2026\n\n&gt; \u2026He tried to brush it off, but the feeling got stronger and stronger, and that's when he realized that he couldn't hear anything anymore. The sounds of the forest were gone, and he couldn't hear his own breathing. It was like some kind of weird, *awful tinnitus*, but more oppressive\u2026'\n\n- One more detail; in two instances before SAR had two accounts of the Bear Man (one from a civilian, the other from OP's friend) there were also reports of dangerous animals...bears and mountain lions, respectively. \n",

That night we told spooky stories, you know, haunted tent, haunted house and stuff like that. One story stuck out, it was crappy, but original. Big Cannibal willy. Guy was in an asylum, getting read his last rights, he killed the priest, and walked out in the guys white robes. Yippee. Well, next morning we kids were collecting sticks for breakfast. The oldest kid, John, was ahead of me. My sis and his bro were lagging behind. I somehow got ahead of him and saw some cool berries, while i was distracted, he got wayyy ahead of me. I start walking faster, and he is like stomping through the brush, his long white shirt covering up his cargo pants. I whine and tell him to stop. I say \"John, wait up\"  Suddenly i am spun around by my sister. She looks at me and says \"What are you doing? We are way too far from camp\" I'm about to tell her off but i see behind her John and his brother. At least ten feet back. And no one in our group was wearing white, only green, blue and brown. I whip around and the person is gone. Not a trace. There isnt that many trees, and the ones that are there are thin. So they couldn't of just hid. I was pretty shaken up about it. I remember the white shirt. Everyone joked about \"Big Willy\"   But still i have no idea what the hell it was. It was so weird.",

            "comment": "I grew up in the PNW, and have gone camping a lot as an adult. Nothing comes close to freaking me out like the one time I went \"bear hunting\" with my first boyfriend.\n\nSo my boyfriend in the early 1970s who was a Vietnam vet, finally convinced me to go in the mountains outside Spokane \"bear hunting.\" He took a lot of garbage which he dumped about a block from where we put up our tent, then we headed out in his jeep to climb the mountain. Shifting his jeep into low gear, he powered half way up before he high-centered on a rock. He tore the oil pan out and we rolled backwards down the hill. Now we were totally screwed...20 miles into dense mountain trails and 2 hours from Spokane where we lived. Taking our rifles (his, but we both had one) we left our camp area and walked several miles along a dirt road before we came upon several guys cooking squirrel over a campfire. He talked with them for a while, looked at me, and then said, \"You take our guns and hike back to the tent and stay there. I'll jog back (20 miles!) to town and return for you.\" No problem.\n\nWe separated and I marched along the dirt road with the rifles and extra ammo belts criss-crossed across my chest. I found the trail that lead to our tent, walked past the mound of garbage and down to our tent. I went in (now its about 2p) and promptly fell asleep.\n\nI woke up startled by a noise REAL CLOSE outside the tent. It sounded like something HUGE moving through the brush. Was it a bear, a moose, or what? I had no idea. It was pitch black in the tent. I had no idea what time it was, but I was scared shitless! I groped for the rifle, and was just about to cock it, zip the flap open and shoot it into the air to hopefully scare whatever was prowling around the tent when headlights blinded me. My boyfriend arrived with my dad and one of his friends, and was my boyfriend ever pissed! All the way back to town, he kept saying, \"Why didn't you build a fire?

            "comment": "Hello,  \nI'm currently employed at the CDC with the background in hematology and ID specialist (infectious disease specialist), going on for about 15 years.  \nSome of the projects (I would say most) are highly classified as given to the wrong hands will cause a pandemic but they're protocol measurements to prevent that.  \nWhat does the CDC have to do with anything about the OP?  \nI'll give you a little bit of what I know about the staircase.  \nThe CDC was founded in 1946, but before that, there was a smaller organization that kept archives about past pandemics, diseases, pretty much anything related to death and some supernatural cases (much like how the vatican archives are depicted).  \n1 year later, in 1947, the famous roswell crash. Of course, it's up to you to decide if there actually were aliens that crashed or not. But that same year, the CDC budget increased 10x.  \nUsually when the CDC budget increases, it's usually means that it's trying to increase its black market funding for black projects. Of course, this was over 50 years ago and the CDC records of it doesn't exist in the system.\nMoving on, that same year, the national park ranger started reporting about animals randomly being mutilated and we were brought in to investigate and during that time, it was cheaper for the DoD to send in the national guard for protection while we were investigating the deaths.  \nAfter what was suppose to be a 1-2 weeks investigation, turned out to be a 6 months investigation. Dozens of people who were on the field reported about the staircase or stones being in the middle of no where. We did further investigation of this and it turned out, some of the staircase sites were emitting a frequency that wasn't measurable.  \nHere's the interesting part. If there was ever a paranormal case that was involved, we were to call a specialize department (not part of the CDC) but in order to get them, we had to go through an intensive list of protocols. But eventually, they were called in.  \nFast forward 6 months, hand written accounts in journals were made and only passed down through trusted colleagues and I received this journal a few years ago from someone who recently retired but the old saying is, we never really retire because we're usually called in to review a case for further opinions.  \nThe journal is over 2200 pages (more like a history book) of first hand documented experience about some of the most craziest thing out there. What's written about the staircase?  \nFirst, they thought it was someone who wanted to build a house in the middle of the woods but decided to get up and leave for some reason but the problem remains, when you build a house, the first thing you DON'T build are stairs. While further investigation, the first weird thing started to happen was the staircase vanishing and re-appearing in a different location. When they first stationed a tent 30 meters away from the staircase, they woke up to it being vanished. The imprints left on the ground was pitch black, almost looking like it was toasted on the spot. Next 2 days, it re-appeared but 50 meters away. They decided to do some readings and tried to sample part of the staircase but the wood structure staircase was harder then steel. None of it could be chipped off for sampling. One of the things they found about the structure was that, it was emitting frequency. To emit frequency, usually means that there's a receiver at the other end and that's what they were trying to find out. Who or what was receiving the other end of this staircase? While the structure was harder then steel and emitting a frequency, they wanted to further research this. 6 days later, it disappeared. A search party was sent out to look for another set of stairs. They eventually found a set of stairs but it was different this time. The first party who made initial contact had disturbing accounts. One of the accounts were that when they got close to the staircase to confirm, they felt as if the weather suddenly went black and wind started to pick up. They had a feeling of darkness and terror so they decided to pull back and just call it in. Few hours later, they set up camp around the staircase, and set up cameras pointing at the staircase 24/7. One of the weird things written about this part was that, every 3 hours, the camera and readings would spike, right on the dot. Almost like it had a hear beat but bumping every 3 hours.  \nAbout a month later and not still not much about the staircase, they ran into a tribe who knew all about the staircase. They tracked down a translator and flew him in. Apparently, from the tribes account, the staircase are portals to other dimensions, some being like another Earth, purgatory, hell, heaven, etc. It may be why some of the staircase exhibited fear and terror and some exhibited neutral, and others loved. The tribe later goes into detail about travelling into one of these dimensions. When you enter these portals, there's no going back because the link is only a one way ticket, which may explained why we only found readings of it sending out a frequency but with no returning signals or anything. They also go into accounts of big tall human beings using these (bigfoot) and how they are kidnapping their kids. While the notion of bigfoot seems interesting, we couldn't link bigfoot to it because we found no accounts but it doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.  \nOh boy, not sure if i'm running out of space but if anyone finds this interesting, ill continue writing more of it.

I go out with volunteer trail maintence trips sometimes during the summer, and on this particular one we were like 20 miles down some fire acess dirt/gravel road and then hiked in 6 miles. From base camp to the worksite it was at least another 2. We were out one day replacing a puncheon bridge and for lunchbreak i decided to climb ontop of this large boulder and chill. I get up there and look around and a few hundred meters out theres these small steps, probaly no taller then like 5 feet. Looked like it came out of an apartment or something, it was weird. I dont know how i dismissed it at the time but reading these stories brought it to mind.",

I think I thought it was the remains of one of the many buildings that used to exist on their property and where subsequently torn down but they where just in the middle of a meadow surrounded by tall grass and no debris from any sort of building? This sort of mahogany staircase that spiraled upward with tan carpet, like a display from a home improvement show room dropped into the middle of bumfuck-nowhere Michigan. \n\n",

Given some of them are tragic, but it scares me more than any horror movie because it leaves your own mind to fill in the blanks with what might have happened to these people especially the one with the bodies found much later. It could be as simple as them just dying and being picked apart by animals to them being abducted by aliens/mountain people. You always get me with the stair cases and I'm a lot \nMore curious now about them. The reason being is because I have a close friend who hikes and he has seen them. He claims they were built during the Great Depression to help clean up the AT, but he has said that he gets weird feelings around them still and doesn't really go hiking anymore. A former boss of mine also used to hike a lot and it freaked her out because she got that instant terror feeling when she saw one on the AT. She's never gone to that same place again. These stairs are what gets me and how mysterious they are. I'm looking forward to more stories and stay safe out there dude.",

Also higher level in woods is useful to find a proper direction so we have a compilation of a path and direction wich corelate with a search of missing person. \n\nSummarizing, the stairs are a symbol of missing persons' trace. That looks like that wood is cursed. I come from slavic culture (the witcher and stuff) and cursed lands aren't uncommon among villagers' talk. In our national parks we put christian crosses or obelisks. Pagan culture quickly adapted to christianity, 'cause christian \"magic\" simply started to work. \n\nProbably in your woods there is a psycho-shaman or a very strong curse. I would bet that some slaughtered Indians cursed the land. Most of paranormal cases the OP told, were made to scary the SAR officers. Looks like the land wants them to get out. I would say that there is a pattern of child abduction. Probably it is a message to SAR \"no matter what you do, people will still dissapear and you can do nothing to save them.\"\n\nIn my city there is a pub that you can literally have your beer got \"magically\" taken away by ghosts of Jews killed in that basement during WW II. When it comes to midnight, sometimes 1 a.m., sometimes 2 a.m. the ghosts get pissed and are kicking people out. Seems funny? Well old clients know the drill. When glass breaks out of nowhere, the doors open and shut by itself, it is time to leave.",

    "postText": "When I was getting started, an actor I knew gave me some really good advice. While deciding whether or not to take a certain role, consider three factors: the money, the show, and the people. If at least two of those things are good, accept the job. If they\u2019re paying you well and you love the play, you won\u2019t mind putting up with shitty people. If it\u2019s a great show with a cast full of friends, but you\u2019re not getting paid so well, that\u2019s still alright, it\u2019ll be artistically fulfilling. If it\u2019s a bad show but you love the cast and you\u2019re making money, you\u2019ll probably have the time of your life making fun of the playwright backstage and laughing all the way to the bank.\n\n\r  \nWhat my friend failed to mention is that as an aspiring actor, you don\u2019t usually get to be that picky. When I got the call from my agent that a production of *The Bacchae* was urgently seeking a new chorus member, all I could see were dollar signs. My survival job had just fallen through (the family I nannied for was moving upstate, insisting that Manhattan had just gotten \u201ctoo dangerous\u201d for their toddler), and my savings were only going to cover my rent for another month. \n\n\r  \nIt was raining the day of my audition, and my train got delayed. I showed up panting (I had to run from the subway station) and my hair a disaster. Luckily, in *The Bacchae*, the chorus is full of\u2026 well\u2026 Bacchae. Fervent followers of Dionysus, wild women, drunk and running through the countryside. In the climax of the play, they crowd the protagonist in a frenzy, literally ripping him limb from limb.\n\n \r  \nI\u2019ll never know if it was my frenetic energy from barely making it to the theater on time, or my actual acting, but I got the part. My costume fitting was the next day\u2013 they weren\u2019t kidding about urgently needing a replacement. Which thrilled me, because *I* wasn\u2019t kidding about urgently needing the money. At the fitting, I discovered something my agent failed to mention about the production: this wasn\u2019t just any version of *The Bacchae*, it was a recreation\u2013 an attempt to perform the play in the traditional Greek style. In other words, everyone was wearing masks.\n\n\r  \nI\u2019ve never been fond of masks. We had to do a few assignments with them in my college acting courses; covering your face can enhance the physicality of your body, something like that. But I never liked wearing them, or seeing other people wearing them. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to call it a full-on fear, but the stiffness, the lack of expression, gives me a weird feeling in my stomach. And wearing one, your field of vision limited, your mouth covered, making it harder to breathe, harder to project your voice\u2013 I don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s as simple as that.\n\n\r  \nBut I needed the money. My costume wasn\u2019t ugly, per se, just strange: a long white dress, or maybe toga is a better word, the fabric about the thickness of a burlap sack. My mask, stark white, paper mache, covering my entire face except my eyes, the mouth carved to imitate a grin. No shoes. My hair tucked into a wild black wig\u2013 we wore wigs, they explained to me, so the chorus could be identical, indistinguishable. We moved as one, spoke as one, and were meant to look like one. They even made sure to cast women of the same height. In our costumes, it was impossible to tell which of us was which.\n\n\r  \nIt didn\u2019t help that I was an outsider to the rest of the cast, joining the show weeks into rehearsals. Everyone seemed annoyed that they had to teach me the blocking, the inflection of the lines (so my voice didn\u2019t stick out from the other chorus girls), and where to go backstage during scenes with no chorus. A few people tried to be nice to me, but quickly gave up when they realized I knew nothing about Greek theater, or masked theater, or the avant garde. My last show had been a regional production of *Cats*, for God\u2019s sake. I was totally out of my element.\n\n\r  \nThings got especially sour when I tried to ask what had happened to the girl I was replacing. Nobody wanted to talk about it. People gasped when I brought it up. The clearest answer I got was a whispered, hesitant, \u201cshe fell,\u201d but the person wouldn\u2019t elaborate any further. The cast seemed superstitious, uncomfortable, like talking about her would cause them to suffer her fate: removal from the show. And it was clear that, aside from me, everyone else *loved* this show. The actor playing Dionysus, the couple of times he deigned to talk to me, just kept gushing about how honored he was to play this role, how electrifying it felt to put his history minor to use, to show people a piece of the world\u2019s theatrical beginnings.\n\n\r  \nI thought the show was fine. Kinda boring, kinda scary. I don\u2019t think I \u201cget\u201d *The Bacchae*. In brief, the story is about Dionysus, son of Zeus, disguised as a human. He and his followers (the chorus) show up in a town, but the leader of the town, Pentheus, is upset about it. He doesn\u2019t understand why all these women are acting crazy, and he arrests Dionysus, not believing him to be an actual God. As punishment, Dionysus possesses Pentheus\u2019s own mother with the same madness as his followers, and together, with their bare hands, they rip Pentheus apart. His mom walks back into town holding her son\u2019s head, thinking it to be, in her madness, the head of a lion. When she realizes what she\u2019s done, she is overwhelmed by grief, and futilely attempts to put Pentheus\u2019s mutilated corpse back together. Dionysus returns, basically saying, \u201cwell, he said I wasn\u2019t a God, and that\u2019s blasphemous, so he got what was coming to him.\u201d Pentheus\u2019s mother is exiled. \n\n\r  \nIt\u2019s incredibly dark. In the reviews, critics called it daring, challenging, a bloody spectacle, a feminist masterpiece. I don\u2019t really get what part of \u201ca man who\u2019s a God possesses women\u2019s minds, driving them to murder\u201d screams \u201cfeminism,\u201d but hey, I\u2019m the girl who commuted to New Jersey every day for four months to do *Cats*, what do I know?\n\n\r  \nHere\u2019s something I do know: the other chorus girls did not like me. And they took their jobs seriously. As we waited to enter for each scene, there was dead quiet in the wings. Usually, there\u2019s some light joking, maybe quickly running lines, maybe physical warmups, shaking out your nerves\u2013 I tried to do this once. Before our entrance at the top of the show, we all gathered in the stage right wing, all twelve of us, a perfect and identical dozen. It was a dress rehearsal. No audience. I did a few jumping jacks, trying to hype myself up. Another masked girl grabbed my bicep, hard. When I turned, she just shook her head \u201cno.\u201d Just a simple, silent, \u201cno.\u201d We don\u2019t do that here. We stand silently in the wings, focusing on our craft, breathing, waiting for our entrance. I never tried it again.\n\n\r  \nWhen you can\u2019t talk to your coworkers, acting becomes a lot less fun. The collaboration element is totally gone. And honestly, the \u201cacting\u201d element was gone for me, too. How am I supposed to find my character or sense of identity in a role when my role is \u201cdon\u2019t let your voice stick out, don\u2019t take a wrong step, blend in perfectly with eleven women who dislike you?\u201d\n\n\r  \nSo before the shows, instead of chatting, or doing jumping jacks, I wandered the theater. I\u2019ve always loved theaters; the dramatic architecture, the ornate prosceniums, the stark contrast of backstage, so dark, so dusty. The theater was no Broadway house, but it had a fly system (which we didn\u2019t use, because the Greeks wouldn\u2019t have been able to fly anything in), just over three hundred seats (including a mezzanine\u2013 fancy!), and lots of backstage space. I could say more about it, because I spent hours during the run of the show wandering, but it wouldn\u2019t be terribly interesting to anyone who\u2019s not me. Just know, it was a beautiful old theater\u2013 and I mean OLD. Built in the 1910s, just before the Great Depression. I used to love imagining how many generations of people had performed on that stage, imagining what they\u2019d think of this show, or what they\u2019d think of me.\n\n\r  \nAbout a week into my wandering, on some fifteen-minute break, I was looking at the ladder that led up to the catwalk\u2013 a long, thin metal walkway stretching across the stage from above, usually used for hanging lights. I wondered how long it had been since it was used during a show. I wondered if it was even safe. What would the view be like from up there, seeing the entire stage from thirty feet in the air?\n\n\r  \nI slowly looked up the ladder. I wouldn\u2019t actually climb it. That would be crazy, right? I\u2019m not particularly good with heights. As my eyes lifted, I made eye contact\u2013 or rather, mask contact\u2013 with someone. A fellow chorus girl, up on the catwalk. \n\n\r  \nI stopped breathing for a second. What was she doing up there? I started to say something stupid, like, \u201cWhy are you up there?\u201d when just as quickly as the face appeared, it vanished. I saw her white robed form retreat down the catwalk, heading for a different ladder, probably. It was weird. Why did she run? Embarrassed to be caught somewhere she shouldn\u2019t be?\n\n\r  \nI allowed myself to entertain a little fantasy: maybe she was just like me. Maybe she also hated the other chorus girls, and didn\u2019t \u201cget\u201d *The Bacchae*. Maybe she was exploring the theater for fun on our break, enjoying the old architecture, like I did. I had no idea who she was under the mask, and she had no idea who I was. She probably thought I was one of the normal judgemental girls, and ran off before I could tell on her to the stage manager.\n\n\r  \nI was filled with unfounded hope. Could I make a friend here? Was it possible? After two and a half weeks of silence from the other girls, it was hard to imagine. How would I find her? How would I let her know it was me\u2013 that I had seen her on the catwalk, and we were the same?\n\n\r  \nAfter that day, I got much more observant. When the director called for a break, instead of immediately retreating into the depths of backstage, I watched my eleven doppelgangers carefully, tracking who went for water, who went back to the dressing rooms, who ran off towards the vending machines. It was hard to tell everyone apart, but people had to take their masks off to drink water eventually. I memorized faces and tried to keep track of them. I started to get a handle on everyone\u2019s patterns, narrowing down potential adventurers. \n\n\r  \nIt was impossible. Eleven people is too many to observe. But I\u2019m an actor. Memorizing shit is literally my job. By week four, just days from opening, I had three potential girls. I tried to stick close to them during rehearsals, picking one to follow each day, but nobody ever wandered towards the catwalk. Maybe the girl, whoever she was, had been scared away from adventuring when I caught her. I started to lose hope. We were opening soon\u2013 I should focus on making my entrances, not making friends.\n\n\r  \nBut then I saw her again. \n\n\r  \nThis time, it was half an hour before the curtain went up for our invited dress rehearsal. The press was there. I was nervous. I knew I had my part down, but when you\u2019re doing a show, no matter how prepared you are, there\u2019s always the lingering fear that you\u2019ll freeze up, forget everything, and ruin everyone\u2019s hard work. It just means that you care. I was surprised that I cared so much. I still didn\u2019t even *get* the play. I couldn\u2019t let the other girls see me weak. I barely show my real feelings to people I care about, much less mean actresses who look down on me. To get away from it all, I wandered down to another unused part of the stage: the orchestra pit. We did have music in the show, but the Greeks didn\u2019t have orchestra pits. So it was closed off, being used as storage. \n\n\r  \nI loved it down there. I loved looking through the storage bins, finding props from long-forgotten productions\u2013 sometimes I would find something incredible, something I swore was from the day the theater opened, something old and valuable\u2013 and usually, I could never find it again. Those bins were a treasure trove. Of all the weird little spaces I found backstage, the pit was my favorite. I felt like a real explorer down there, illuminating my path with my phone flashlight, getting spooked when a mouse ran over my foot (of course the theater had mice, it was more than a hundred years old! And besides, every building has mice in New York City).\n\n\r  \nThat day, I wasn\u2019t there to look around. Just to sit. Just to catch my breath. I tiptoed down the creaky steps, and plopped myself on the ground, surrounded by bins. I inhaled and exhaled, smelling the mildew-y scent of old props on every side of me. And that\u2019s when I heard a noise. Not a mouse noise\u2013 I was used to those. Something bigger. I turned my phone flashlight on immediately, calling, \u201chello?\u201d\n\n\r  \nAnd the light landed on a mask, just like mine. Mine which was currently off, because I was doing my breathing exercises. I felt exposed\u2013 she could see my face, but I couldn\u2019t see hers. I stood up. \u201cYou scared me!\u201d\n\n\r  \nShe didn\u2019t respond. She looked at me for a second, and started to retreat the other way, towards the stairs at the other side of the pit.\n\n\r  \n\u201cWait!\u201d I called. \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone I saw you!\u201d\n\n\r  \nShe stopped for a second. But then she kept walking. I stood and followed. \u201cPlease stop. Can I at least know who you are? I don\u2019t fit in with most of the chorus girls\u2013\u201d\n\n\r  \nI reached for her long white toga. I swear, I had it in my hand, but somehow, she slipped away. I staggered a bit, almost tripped, confused that I hadn\u2019t made contact with her costume. And when I looked back up, I only saw a glimpse of her disappearing up the stairs.  I tried to follow, again, but I found that side of the pit\u2019s stairs reached a dead end. I didn\u2019t understand how she\u2019d gotten out. And when I looked back down at my phone, it was time for places. Disappointed and defeated, I rushed away to the other stairs, making my way to the stage right wing to wait for my entrance.\n\n\r  \nI counted heads immediately when I arrived. Maybe she hadn\u2019t made it back yet. But, alas: twelve. All accounted for. I nudged a girl next to me, subtly. \u201cWho was the last one here besides me?\u201d\n\n\r  \nShe just stared at me for a moment, which came off as very creepy through the blank dead stare of her mask. \u201cHow the fuck am I supposed to know? We all look exactly the same.\u201d \n\n\r  \nI sighed. \u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d *For nothing*, I thought bitterly.\n\n\r  \nThe invited dress went well. The press liked it, as I\u2019ve already said. I was distracted the entire time. After that day, I made it a habit to count all the girls when the stage manager called for \u201cplaces.\u201d If I was right about this girl, she, like me, would be one of the last, if not *the* last one there. She would be wandering, exploring, getting away from the bullies.\n\n\r  \nI wish I hadn\u2019t done this. I wish I\u2019d given up when she disappeared on a dead-end staircase. I wish I\u2019d never seen her on the catwalk. Because when I started counting heads, I noticed something impossible. Sometimes, before we went on, I counted thirteen identical masked faces.\n\n\r  \nIt was a chorus of twelve. It was *supposed* to be twelve. I\u2019d recount. Recount again. Thirteen. A chill went down my spine. We all looked the same. Same masks, same togas, same wigs. Who was the imposter? How *could* anyone be an imposter? It didn\u2019t make sense. How would they get into the theater? How would they get a costume?\n\n\r  \nI started counting more often. Between scenes, in the dressing rooms, even on stage during dull moments. It fluctuated. Sometimes I\u2019d count twelve for a whole day, an entire show, and sigh in relief, feeling like some curse was broken. But the next day, at least once, I\u2019d count thirteen.\n\n\r  \nAnd it seemed as if one masked pair of eyes was always trained on me. I don\u2019t know how she knew it was me. We looked the same. But she\u2019d stare. It felt scary, but also ridiculous\u2013 I couldn\u2019t be sure it was the same person looking every time. I couldn\u2019t be sure it was unlucky number thirteen. But I *felt* like it was.\n\n\r  \nI felt a lot of things. I felt like I couldn\u2019t tell anyone. The other girls already didn\u2019t like me\u2013 I couldn\u2019t have them thinking I was crazy. And admitting the presence of the thirteenth would mean admitting to my adventures into forbidden backstage areas. I couldn\u2019t lose this job. I was living paycheck to paycheck. I wasn\u2019t eating well, or sleeping well\u2013 maybe this was all a hallucination. And somehow, my biggest feeling was that if I told someone about the thirteenth, I\u2019d never see her again.\n\n\r  \nAnd I needed to see her again. The obsession had only gotten stronger. I knew, somehow, deep inside, that she was the one I had seen on the catwalk and in the orchestra pit. I no longer wanted to be her friend\u2013 I wanted to corner her. To ask who she was, and why she was sneaking in as if she was one of us. I wanted to ask what she wanted from me.\n\n\r  \nBecause she must want something from me, right? Why else would she stare? Why would she appear only to me? \n\n\r  \nThe timing never lined up. The show had opened at this point, and I had a job to do: delighting the audience. I couldn\u2019t skip my entrance to catch number thirteen. The chorus formations would look ridiculous with a missing person. And as much as the other girls hated me, I owed it to them as my costars to make them look good.\n\n\r  \nLogically, I knew there was only one person the thirteenth could be: Catalina, the actress I\u2019d replaced. She must be jealous of me. Bitter. Maybe she wanted to take my role, like I\u2019d taken hers. It would be insane, but it was all that made sense. She was the only other person who had the costume, who knew the keypad code to get into the theater. She must have recovered from her fall and come to find me.\n\n\r  \nIt was almost like a game. It definitely made the show more interesting for me. Before I realized what was happening, I dreaded performances. I felt stupid, taking on this role in a show I didn\u2019t even understand. But now I had so much to do. I had to plan. \n\n\r  \nI started showing up early, an hour before my call time. I walked my old spots, thinking I may see her. The other chorus girls were impressed that I was showing up early, thinking it showed some sort of dedication to the show. I think they even started to hate me less. They still detested any attempts at conversation in the wings, but in the dressing room, I started to have a few breakthroughs. In particular, I started a semi-friendship with Erin. Ironically, she had been one of the three women I thought may be the thirteenth, until I realized the thirteenth wasn\u2019t really one of us at all.\n\n\r  \nShe was the only person who I could actually ask about Catalina. \u201cDid she ever say anything about the theater? The building, I mean? Did she have a favorite part of it?\u201d\n\n\r  \nErin would laugh at my seemingly random specificity. \u201cWe weren\u2019t close, Michelle. I have no idea what she thought about the theater.\u201d\n\n\r  \n\u201cWhat did she do on her breaks?\u201d\n\n\r  \nErin thought for a second. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I never saw her at the vending machines, or the dressing room. I guess she found some quiet place to run lines.\u201d\n\n\r  \nThat confirmed it, for me. A quiet place like the catwalk. Or the orchestra pit. We were three weeks into our five week run when I came up with a plan to catch Catalina. It wasn\u2019t a great plan, and I had no idea if it would work, but showing up an hour early every day was making me tired and producing zero results. I needed a new strategy. I realized that after seeing her in the pit, I only ever saw the thirteenth when all twelve of us were together.\n\n\r  \nSo I told a white lie. One night after the show, when everyone was changing in the dressing room, I appealed to my fellow chorus girls. \u201cAre you guys busy before the show tomorrow?\u201d I innocently asked. \u201cI\u2019m feeling a little shaky on some of the entrances. If we could all get here just twenty minutes before our call time tomorrow, I\u2019d love to run some stuff with you guys. I\u2019ve been running it on my own, but without the entire team, I don\u2019t always remember where I fit.\u201d\n\n\r  \nTo my surprise and intense joy, everyone agreed. They really did seem to respect me more when I looked like I was taking my role seriously. I could barely sleep that night, I was so excited to see if my plan worked. And hey, if it didn\u2019t, I had two more weeks of shows to think up something else.\n\n\r  \nIt was a Sunday night, our last show of the week. Mondays are often \u201cdark days\u201d in professional theater, meaning there are no shows that day to give the team a rest. I had planned this on purpose\u2013 if I failed, I had a dark day to reflect on that failure and try again.\n\n\r  \nAt 5:40, twenty minutes before our call time, all the girls were assembled and in costume. We started running entrances. After ten minutes, I thought my plan had failed. We had run our first three entrances, and I never counted more than twelve heads in the wings. But around 5:55, as we got to our entrances in act two, offstage, I locked eyes with a mask. A thirteenth mask.\n\n\r  \nI quickly told everyone \u201cI think I got it, you guys, thank you so much for coming early!\u201d Everyone mumbled that it was no problem, that they were happy to help.\n\n\r  \nThe thirteenth mask broke eye contact with me, looking around in confusion\u2013 perhaps distress. The girls started to trickle back towards the dressing room. The thirteenth turned and power-walked away. I shoved through the crowd to catch her, not calling out like I had in the past. I knew she didn\u2019t respond to that. I knew I had to catch her now or never. Once we were out of the crowd\u2019s eyeline, I began to run. She ran, too. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting away this time!\u201d I yelled, like some kind of cartoon superhero. My adrenaline was pumping, and blood rushed to my ears. \n\n\r  \nAfter I yelled, I suddenly became aware of another set of running feet behind me. \u201cMichelle? Where are you going?\u201d It was Erin\u2019s voice.\n\n\r  \n\u201cDon\u2019t follow me!\u201d I hastily called back, picking up speed. The thirteenth also picked up speed. Though she was running just as fast as I was, she showed no signs of exertion. I couldn\u2019t hear heavy breathing, or heavy feet on the floor. It was like she was gliding. It infuriated me. \n\n\r  \nErin didn\u2019t let up. \u201cMichelle, the stage manager is gonna wonder where we are!\u201d\n\n\r  \nI ignored her. The thirteenth rounded a corner, and I realized where she was going: the catwalk. The ladder.\n\n\r  \nShe ascended the rungs rapidly, like a spider. I clamored up much less gracefully. Erin\u2019s voice had a heavy tinge of concern. \u201cMichelle, what are you doing?! It\u2019s not safe up there!\u201d\n\n\r  \n\u201cThen don\u2019t follow me!\u201d I yelled back, exasperated. \u201cThis is between me and her!\u201d Despite my vocal warning, I heard Erin climbing behind me.\n\n\r  \nOnce on the metal rail, I looked both ways, terrified she\u2019d escaped me again. But her white toga was just a few feet away, retreating into darkness. I lunged at her. The entire catwalk shook. The thirteenth and I both grabbed the railing to steady ourselves. We met eyes. Or rather, we met masks.\n\n\r  \n\u201cYou have nowhere to go.\u201d I stated.\n\n\r  \nI heard Erin reaching the top of the ladder behind me. \u201cMichelle, come down, *please*. You\u2019re scaring me.\u201d\n\n\r  \n\u201cI can\u2019t. I finally have her.\u201d I took a step towards the thirteenth. She took an equal and opposite step back. \u201cTake the mask off.\u201d I beckoned her. \u201cI know it\u2019s you, Catalina.\u201d\n\n\r  \nI felt the rail shake slightly as Erin got on it. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Michelle?!\u201d\n\n\r  \n\u201cShe\u2019s been sneaking in, Erin! She\u2019s been standing in the wings with us before we enter! For *weeks!*\u201d I took another step towards the thirteenth. In my peripheral vision, I could see how high we were above the stage. Thirty feet. You could die, falling from that height.\n\n\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s not Catalina. It can\u2019t be. Stop this.\u201d Erin called. Finally, frustrated, I turned towards her. \n\n\r  \n\u201cWho else could it be?!\u201d\n\n\r  \nErin had taken her mask off. Her face was streaked with terror. \u201cCatalina died, Michelle. She fell off this catwalk, directly onto her face, and she *died*. Please come down with me. I don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking to, and I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to do, but it isn\u2019t worth it.\u201d\n\n\r  \n\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019m talking to\u2013\u201d\n\n\r  \nI turned back, and she was gone. Vanished like a bad dream. \u201cI swear to God, Erin.\u201d I started to say. \u201cShe was right in front of me. I chased her here\u2013\u201d\n\n\r  \nI turned back to Erin. The thirteenth was behind her. \n\n\r  \nIt made no sense. Nobody can move that fast. Nobody can be in front of me one second and behind me the next. It was inhuman. I stopped speaking. I stopped breathing. It sucks to learn that in a fight-or-flight situation, my answer is to freeze.\n\n\r  \nErin must\u2019ve seen how my face changed. \u201cMichelle?\u201d She asked quietly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\n\r  \nBehind her, the thirteenth raised a hand to her mask. Her hands were impossibly pale. How had I never noticed that before? She gripped the mask in her hand. Time stretched. It must\u2019ve only been a second, because Erin didn\u2019t move. But it felt like years of my life passed me by as the thirteenth, inch by inch, raised her mask from her face. Or\u2013 raised her mask. \n\n\r  \nBecause there was no face.\n\n\r  \nUnder the mask, pale and gruesome, was a bloody flat edge. Broken, disgusting, it was impossible to make out eyes, or a nose, or a mouth. Inside a somewhat face-shaped frame of stark-white skin, all I could see was flesh, red and raw, squished in on itself. Like someone had fallen from a very high height. And landed on their face.\n\n\r  \nBy the time I finally began to react, it was too late. The thirteenth\u2013 or, Catalina\u2013 or, the ghost, or\u2013 whatever the fuck that *thing* was. It moved its hands from the mask to Erin\u2019s shoulders. And it pushed. And she screamed, agonizingly loud, as she flew over the side of the railing. And she screamed for the second or so she was in the air. I was screaming, too. And after the crunch of her body hitting the wooden floor of the stage, everyone else screamed, cast and crew alike.\n\n\r  \nI stared down at her limp form from thirty feet up. Her legs were twisted the wrong way. A pool of blood began to seep out of her. When I looked up again, I expected the thirteenth to be gone, but it wasn\u2019t. With no eyes, it was also looking down at Erin. At what it had done.\n\n\r  \nAnd then, slowly, it turned towards me. On all fours, backwards, I scrambled away from it on the catwalk, terrified, not wanting to be next. The thirteenth\u2019s shoulders shook rapidly, like a person laughing. But it made no sound. It *never* made a sound. Not going up the stairs of the orchestra pit. Not when it pushed Erin. And not as it climbed back down the ladder, rung by rung. I found myself alone on the catwalk.\n\n\r  \nErin survived, somehow, paralyzed from the waist down. Apparently she fell on her legs, which, when you\u2019re falling from thirty feet up, is a good thing. If she\u2019d gone down head first, there was no chance. The show had to close, of course. When they lost Catalina a few weeks into rehearsal, she was replaceable. But with me refusing to go on, and Erin in the hospital, there was nothing to be done. I haven\u2019t seen Erin since that day. I feel too guilty. But I was never arrested, so I guess she told the authorities that I didn\u2019t push her. I don\u2019t know what she told them. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve told them, had they asked me.\n\n\r  \nI don\u2019t do stage plays anymore. The family I used to nanny for gave me a star-studded recommendation, and now I make my living taking care of a five-year-old and a two-year-old for another filthy-rich family. I still act, but I only audition for film work. \n\n\r  \nI don\u2019t even see plays these days. I won\u2019t set foot in a theater. If the thirteenth had vanished off that catwalk, maybe things would be different. Maybe I could chalk it up to an extreme hallucination, some terrifying creature my mind brewed up to cope with the stress of the show and paying rent. Maybe I could even forget its bloody mess of viscera in the vague shape of a face.\n\n\r  \nBut I saw it go down that ladder. Rung by fucking rung. And I know it\u2019s still out there.\n\n\r  \nErin was unlucky. Erin was a victim of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. And if I step inside a theater again, some way, somehow, I know the thirteenth will get me on another catwalk. \n\n\r  \nThis time, I\u2019ll be the one going over the railing.\n\n\r  \nAnd I\u2019ve never once landed on my feet.",

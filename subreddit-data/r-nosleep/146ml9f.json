    "postText": "I\u2019m not gonna beat around the bush. Maybe it\u2019s my fault, but at least it gives me a guess as to what started this all.\n\nMy friend Henry had a bad breakup and invited the guys out to go bar hopping. His own liquor therapy, if you will. \n\nObviously, that\u2019s my buddy, so I went. One of the guys set it up so his girlfriend would pick us up at like 2:30-ish so we were all free to get as fucked up as we wanted. \n\nI\u2019d like to think I\u2019m an average guy. I don\u2019t drink more than a beer a day, if that. Rarely party. Never do drugs unless it\u2019s the occasional smoke sesh. \n\nWhen I do party, I like to get a little wild. Sue me. \n\nSo we getting pretty crazy throughout the night and after the third or fourth(?) bar, that\u2019s when things start to get a little hazy. I really couldn\u2019t tell you how much I drank, but I was definitely drunk. \n\nAgain, hazy memory, but it was getting close to 2:30 so I\u2019m pretty sure we started off toward wherever it was Mike\u2019s girlfriend was gonna pick us up. We were stumbling and being rowdy; we fit in with all the other drunks. \n\nI felt something cold on my shoulder and groggily turned around.\n\nThe chick in front of me was like everything I\u2019m into checked off. Long red hair, brown eyes, and the body\u2026\n\n\u201cHey, gorgeous,\u201d I mumbled, and even in my drunken state, I knew I sounded like an idiot. \n\nShe only smiled and looked down, and my eyes followed her gaze to my wallet in her hand. \n\n\u201cIs this yours?\u201d She asked. Her voice was hypnotic. \n\n\u201cDude, yeah. Thanks. You\u2019re a lifesaver,\u201d I said as I pocketed it. \n\nShe bit her lip. Coy. \n\nI kept talking.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all heading to my friend\u2019s house to crash, you wanna come with?\u201d \n\nSomething flashed, a glimmer of sharp red in her deep brown eyes. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t, I have plans, but maybe,\u201d her cool hands touched my forearm, her nails gently pressing against my skin. \u201cMaybe a rain check?\u201d\n\nI nodded quickly.\n\nShe leaned in and pressed her lips on my cheek, softly, before her grip on my arm tightened. She dragged me down to pull me into a kiss.\n\nChaste, but effective. We grinned at each other. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d She stuffed a dollar in my hand and hurried off.\n\nI glanced at the bill and noticed a phone number in blue ink. Score.\n\nI didn\u2019t call her the next day because I spent every waking moment nursing my own hangover. Like I said, I don\u2019t drink that much too often. \n\nIt felt worse than usual, though. My skin started itching horribly, but I figured it was related to the whole Asian glow thing. I\u2019d never had it before, but first time for everything right?\n\nIt didn\u2019t get better. \n\nI hadn\u2019t had a hangover in a good 6(?) months, but I knew they didn\u2019t feel this bad. Or weird.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just my usual symptoms, dry mouth, headache, and dizziness.\n\nMy stomach was restless with awful noises and an incessant pain. And my skin! My skin felt like I had ants crawling all over me.\n\nThe day ended, I went to sleep thinking at least now I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nYeah, right.\n\nMost symptoms went away, but my stomach was firm. I\u2019m talking like I had a rock sitting in my gut. My skin was pink and uncomfortable. I had scratch marks on my legs, like I had been itching at my ankles the entire night. \n\nI thought maybe that girl gave me like an STD or something, but I\u2019m still not sure. I\u2019m not too up to date with all that kinda stuff, but I figured google would just tell me I have cancer. Or worse. \n\nI took like 5 tums and coated my limbs in calamine lotion. I did my best to ignore it at work, but I was damn near twitching with the effort it took not to curl up in a ball on the floor and scratch my skin raw.\n\nThe second I made it to my car, I did my best to focus on driving home as I rubbed my body against the seat, trying to find relief.\n\nIt got worse. The stomach pain was something I could get used to, and I kinda did. Just take a stomach pain cocktail every day, I guess! It still ached and felt like I had swallowed a sack of bricks that won\u2019t digest.\n\nIt was my skin.\n\nMy face was peeling, and not like a little sunburn, but thick layers of skin. Everything itched and I couldn\u2019t find any over the counter solution. My sister said aloe vera would work but it just kept me from feeling like I was melting. \n\nYesterday, I almost cried. It\u2019s so freaky and I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nThe skin on my face felt so tight and thin. Like it was being stretched over something it clearly didn\u2019t fit around. I could barely move my mouth, everything felt taut. \n\nMy arms and legs had bunches of ingrown pimples, I think. So so ugly.\n\nToday, I can\u2019t stop shaking. It\u2019s not even something I can get away from because it\u2019s inside my skin. My fucking skin. \n\nI gagged and clutched at the bubbling mass resting against my stomach. I can\u2019t get away.\n\nWhen I woke up, I noticed a few of the lumps had sprouted into gaping holes. I put my glasses on and I saw it. \n\nA bug. \n\nA caterpillar type thing. It was so fat, like it was full of something and it moved sloppily. Still, before I could slap it off, it crawled into one of the holes on my forearm and disappeared.\n\nI can feel it. I can feel a bunch of them.\n\nThey\u2019re in my skin, or under it, I don\u2019t know. They\u2019re in there and they\u2019re moving fast. I can see their nasty little outlines under my skin but I\u2019m too afraid of their dead bodies being stuck inside me to smash them, so they\u2019re all just\u2026 wandering around inside me.\n\nI\u2019ve been looking up bugs to see which ones they look most similar to. I\u2019m almost sure they\u2019re caterpillars, which makes me very nervous. Well, more nervous than I can be about animals inside me.\n\nHow long under they start building cocoons?",

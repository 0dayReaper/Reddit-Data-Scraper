    "postText": "**PART 3:**\n\n.--. = P\n\n..-  = U\n\n.-.  = R\n\n.    =   E\n\nWhat does that even mean? I feel like now I\u2019ve got more questions than I started with\u2026 After reading through some comments on my last post, I came to the realization that those dots and dashes were indeed *NOT* random ink splotches. It was freaking Morse code! How I didn\u2019t come to that realization in the first place is beyond me. But for one thing, my nerves are fried. I\u2019ve not been thinking clearly and I\u2019ve not been sleeping very well. Between constantly being on high alert and staying up every night until I pass out, I feel like I\u2019m slowly losing my mind. So listen, all of you were a great help last time and maybe you can help me figure out what this new sticky note means too. It looks as if it corresponds to the blue one, and I\u2019m starting to think that the color of them doesn\u2019t even matter anymore. The newest one that I\u2019ve received is purple. As promised, I\u2019ve attached pictures of both sticky notes in hopes that all of you can be of some help.\n\nBlue Sticky Note: [https://imgur.com/a/6pL3cnv](https://imgur.com/a/6pL3cnv)\n\nPurple Sticky Note: [https://imgur.com/a/jp73n73](https://imgur.com/a/jp73n73)\n\nBut, I know you all aren\u2019t reading this post to hear me whine about my sanity... So I\u2019ve got an update. I\u2019ve received another sticky note, this one has another marking on the corner and it was delivered to my workplace again\u2026. Straight to my desk... With a dozen white roses. The second I opened the little  envelope and pulled out the sticky note, a sickening wave of nausea crashed over me so hard that I vomited up everything I had for breakfast. The other ladies in the office were quick to rush to my aid. And as comforting as they were, they were all completely oblivious to the fact that this sudden sickness was brought on by the note I\u2019d received with the roses. I hadn\u2019t told anyone at work, and I didn\u2019t intend to. My boss ended up sending me home and telling me to feel better soon. His words were nice, but all I could think about was the fact that I *wasn\u2019t* going to be feeling better anytime soon.\n\nIn the meantime, let me walk all of you through what precautions I have taken. I had my carbon monoxide detector checked\u2026 Twice. I checked for hidden cameras and I checked every vent and cupboard in my apartment. After the first couple of weeks that I dealt with these sticky notes, I also decided to speak with the landlord and see if he could offer any help. My next step was to see if he could assist me in getting my locks changed. He's a nice enough man and is always incredibly helpful. In fact, when I came to him in search of any openings, he was one of the only apartment complexes in town to offer me something around my price range. I was living paycheck to paycheck, and he knew what that was like. I still remember our first interaction clear as day.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n*1 MONTH EARLIER*\n\n\u201cHi! What can I help you with today?\u201d\n\nWarm brown eyes met mine from across the room. He was young, probably in his early thirties, and had a head of thick chestnut colored hair. There was a medley of tattoos on one of his arms, and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how long it took him to gather that many. I smiled and walked up hoping that this time I wouldn\u2019t get turned away. The moment I approached the desk, he was quick to exchange pleasantries and shake my hand. He was a tall man, towering over my small 5\u20196 frame with ease. A little gold name plate stared back at me from the desk: Jack.\n\n\u201cUm, hi Jack! I\u2019m hoping that maybe your apartment complex has some 1 bedroom, one bath openings?\u201d\n\nTapping a pen on the table, he sat back down and clacked away on the keyboard before he looked up and said, \u201cYou\u2019re in luck! We actually just had one open up about a week ago. It\u2019s ready to move in and it\u2019s yours if you want it!\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat! That\u2019s perfect!\u201d I smiled up at him, elated at the fact that I\u2019d finally found an opening. The second he went over pricing though, I felt my smile drop into a concerned frown. As he went over the amenities and everything that was included, I anxiously twisted the ring on my finger. I couldn\u2019t afford any of this\u2026 Tugging the ring free, I continued to fidget with it until I felt it slip from within my grasp and tumble over the desk and onto the floor in front of him. I sheepishly laughed, embarrassed at my nervous habit.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d My words rushed together, tumbling out of my mouth almost as quickly as my ring tumbled out of my hands.\n\nReaching under his desk, he snatched it up and handed it back to me with an understanding smile. \u201cNo biggie! Really! It\u2019s a beautiful little ring.\u201d\n\nCheeks still red with embarrassment, I smiled back and said, \u201cThank you! It was a gift from my grandmother.\u201d\n\nNodding his head, he pointed to it again. \u201cThat ring looks kind of familiar?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s just a simple little purity ring!\u201d I tucked a stray piece of hair behind my ear before slipping it back onto my finger. \u201cPlaying with it is a bit of a nervous habit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he started. \u201cIf the pricing for the apartment is what you\u2019re *nervous* about, I\u2019m sure I could make an adjustment for you. You seem like a really nice person, with a good head on her shoulders and I know finding a decent place to stay around here is a hit or miss.\u201d\n\nA small smile tugged at my lips as I looked up at him. I could hear the genuine sincerity in his words, and I was more than appreciative. \u201cThank you\u2026 really.\u201d\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nAs I sit on my couch, the purple sticky note is staring up at me menacingly from my coffee table as I twirl the little ring around and around my finger.\n\n***\u201cAre you afraid yet?\u201d***\n\nYES! I wanted to shout at it. I am afraid. In fact, I am terrified! The other sticky notes were scattered around it and my eyes roamed over each one, but they stayed on the blue one and the purple one. Both had triangular shaped arrows on them. What did it all mean though? What was this psycho trying to convey to me? Around the time that I was ready to pull my hair out, I heard a knock on my door. My heart raced as I heard the knock sound again. A bit of perspiration collected at my brow as I got up to cross the room. Stopping at the door, shaky breaths left my lips as I tried to force myself to look into the peephole of the door. No one that came to my door felt safe. This stalker could be anyone, and I didn\u2019t want to take my chances. Finally peering through the hole, I noticed it was my next door neighbor. We hadn\u2019t ever spoken and so why he wanted to speak to me now was beyond me. I didn\u2019t even know his name.\n\nLeaning my head up against the door, I drew in slow, steady breaths. The coolness of the door against my forehead was slightly comforting as I waited for the knocking to stop. Once I saw him walk back across the hallway to his apartment I hesitantly opened the door. There on my welcome mat was a note. My breathing quickened again and my vision blurred as I picked it up. My legs threatened to buckle as I reached out to grasp the side of the doorframe. I needed to get a grip. If I wasn\u2019t careful, I was going to send myself into a panic attack, or worse, I was going to pass out. The moment I opened it though, the first thing I noticed was an obvious difference in handwriting. Relief flooded my body for a split second before I took the time to actually read what it said. Closing the door, I locked it and slumped down onto the floor. I couldn\u2019t decide if this message was good or bad, but a part of me hoped that maybe he'd just happened to see something I hadn\u2019t?\n\n***\u201cHey... We need to talk.\u201d***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you missed PART 2: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/143h6zb/i\\_think\\_ive\\_got\\_a\\_stalker\\_and\\_he\\_sends\\_me\\_sticky/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/143h6zb/i_think_ive_got_a_stalker_and_he_sends_me_sticky/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)",

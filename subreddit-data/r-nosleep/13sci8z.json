    "postText": "  \u201cOh thank you! You\u2019re such a kind young man, aren\u2019t you? I really appreciate this you know. I really, really do!\u201d \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just gave a sheepish smile as I set Gloria\u2019s grocieries down on the kitchen counter.\n\n  \u201cIt\u2019s no problem at all Mrs. Mercer!\u201d I assured her.\n\n  \u201cNonsense, you took the time out of your day to help me, the least I can do is thank you!\u201d She said, \u201cCould I get you some tea perhaps? Or would you prefer coffee?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \u201cReally, it\u2019s fine!\u201d I said but she waved a hand dismissively, refusing to take no for an answer.\n\n  \u201cI insist!\u201d\n\n  \u201cCoffee then, I guess.\u201d I said.\n\n  \u201cCoffee it is, then!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really didn\u2019t want to stay at Gloria\u2019s for too long, but it felt rude to just dip out. When I\u2019d noticed her struggling with the groceries, I knew I couldn\u2019t just leave her alone. Gloria was pushing 80 and skinny enough that the wind had blown her over a few times before. Helping her was just the right thing to do. Although I\u2019d never actually taken her up on her offer of coffee or tea before though. She usually offered whenever I helped her out with something, although I usually was able to get out of it. She was nice and all\u2026 but I just had other things to do! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis time though, I was actually in her kitchen and she\u2019d already put the coffee machine on.\n\n  \u201cDo you take cream or sugar?\u201d Gloria asked me.\n\n  \u201cTwo sugars, please, and thank you!\u201d I said, putting on my best smile and taking a seat at the kitchen table. Gloria\u2019s house had a simple sort of grandmotherly charm to it. There were cute little decorative plates hung on the walls and a lot of clutter that felt kind of organized in a way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven watching Gloria putter around the kitchen invoked memories of my own grandmother, (rest in peace). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \u201cYou know it warms my heart so much when people stop to help me,\u201d Gloria said. \u201cThe simplest things can be so difficult when you\u2019re my age\u2026 and time catches up to you so slowly that you never notice just how much it\u2019s taken from you until it\u2019s gone. Like my husband. Oh\u2026 that man was so sweet. You remind me a lot of him, you know.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \u201cYeah?\u201d I asked, trying to participate in the conversation despite not being terribly interested. Just because I didn\u2019t really want to listen to her reminiscences didn\u2019t mean I shouldn\u2019t at least be polite about it. \n\n  \u201cOh yes! He was such a gentleman. He would have liked you, Raj. He would have liked you quite a lot, I think!\u201d \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure I would\u2019ve liked him too!\u201d I said and she chuckled.\n\n  \u201cYou would have. You seem like a very smart boy with a good head on his shoulders! My husband Nigel and I never got to have any children of our own\u2026 but I\u2019m sure that if we ever had a son, he would have wanted one just like you!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \u201cYou\u2019re flattering me, Mrs. Mercer!\u201d I said.\n\n  \u201cNo, not at all!\u201d She said before pouring me a cup of coffee. She took her time adding the sugar to it, before slowly bringing it over to me.\n\n  \u201cYou know\u2026 I miss my Nigel every day,\u201d She sighed. \u201cI did try to date after he passed but\u2026 well\u2026 it was hard to find another man as good as him.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe set the coffee down in front of me.\n\n  \u201cWell, it\u2019s never too late, right Mrs. Mercer?\u201d I asked.\n\n  \u201cOh? That\u2019s sweet of you to say, dear.\u201d She replied wistfully. I took a sip of my coffee. It tasted a little bitter, but I figured she just hadn\u2019t put enough sugar in it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \u201cYou hear so much about just how awful people are towards each other these days that it\u2019s easy to expect the worst of people\u2026 kindness seems in such short supply these days. My husband wouldn\u2019t have stood for that\u2026\u201d Gloria said, staring out toward the window. She seemed a little lost in thought. \u201cI miss him every day, you know\u2026\u201d\n\n  \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking, Mrs. Mercer\u2026 what happened to him?\u201d\n\n  \u201cHe got sick,\u201d She replied. \u201cVery, very sick.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe looked over at me again, snapping out of whatever trance she\u2019d been in.\n\n  \u201cIs the coffee alright, dear?\u201d\n\n  \u201cYeah, it\u2019s great!\u201d I lied and took another sip. She watched me like a hawk for a moment before letting her thoughts take her away again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \u201cYou know, I did try to meet other men after he passed\u2026 but none of them quite measured up. It was so disappointing.\u201d\n\n  \u201cYeah, I can imagine,\u201d I said. \n\n  \u201cCan you?\u201d She asked dismissively. \u201cNo Raj\u2026 I don\u2019t think you can\u2026 forgive my rambling, though. I\u2019m sure that I\u2019m boring you!\u201d\n\n  \u201cYou\u2019re really not!\u201d I said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe looked back at me and cracked a knowing smile. \n\n  \u201cYou don\u2019t need to lie,\u201d She said. \u201cI understand why you are. But you don\u2019t need to. Old stories aren\u2019t of much interest to most people\u2026 and while you are a good man, Raj. I know that your mind is elsewhere. Work. Video games. Your friends. Pretty girls\u2026 but that\u2019s okay. We can work on that.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething about her tone didn\u2019t sit right with me. Her smile didn\u2019t sit right with me either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nActually, nothing about what she\u2019d just said sat right with me. It seemed very\u2026 ominous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI set my coffee cup down, unsure exactly how to respond to her.\n\n  \u201cUm\u2026 yeah, we will\u2026\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe next time? I should probably go.\u201d\n\n  \u201cIf you wish,\u201d She said, staring at me as I started to stand. Although I could already feel my legs starting to give out from under me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Raj\u2026\u201d She said again. \u201cThe others weren\u2019t good\u2026 but you\u2026 you\u2019re just like my Nigel was. You\u2019re the one I\u2019ve been looking for\u2026 I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d\n\n  \u201cG-Gloria\u2026?\u201d I stammered, trying to ask what the hell she was talking about, trying to ask what the hell she\u2019d put in my drink, trying to ask *anything!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the words wouldn\u2019t come out and as I sank to the floor, darkness swallowed me whole and the last thing that I remembered was Gloria smiling down at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t know how long I was out for. I only know that when I woke up, I wasn\u2019t in the kitchen anymore. As far as I could tell, Gloria had moved me down to her basement. Given the headache I had and the faint taste of blood in my mouth, she hadn\u2019t been gentle about it either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs my vision slowly adjusted to the low light around me, I was greeted by the sight of a human face a few feet away from me.\n\n  \u201cHello?\u201d I called, \u201cHello? Is anyone else the-\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy voice died in my throat as I noticed the face beside the one I was looking at. A face that had mostly decayed into little more than a skull. And beside that, was another skull\u2026 and another\u2026 and another\u2026 and another\u2026 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh God, they seemed to line both sides of the room! Skulls upon skulls upon skulls! I wasn\u2019t even able to begin to count them! And as I looked at the skulls that lined the room, I slowly realized that the face I\u2019d been trying to talk to wasn\u2019t attached to a living person. In fact, it wasn\u2019t attached to a person at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \u201cAre you awake, Raj?\u201d Gloria called from the next room. I saw her coming through the door at the end of the room to join me. She\u2019d changed into a flowing white dress that almost looked like a bridal gown. She studied the look of absolute terror on my face before frowning.\n\n  \u201cOh no\u2026 I left the lights too bright, didn\u2019t I dear?\u201d She asked. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026 I hadn\u2019t wanted you to see those just yet.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \u201cWhat the *hell* is this?\u201d I demanded. \n\n  \u201cThese are the men who were\u2026 inadequate,\u201d She said. \u201cThe men who were cruel\u2026 or demanding\u2026 or vulgar\u2026\u201d She shot me a look. \u201cThe men who weren\u2019t as good as my Nigel. I had to get rid of them, you see. I couldn\u2019t just let them go out there and mistreat some other poor girl. It wouldn\u2019t have been right.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stared blankly at her, unable to fully process what I was hearing. I was still trying to accept that the kindly little old lady I\u2019d known for the past few months was a goddamn serial killer! I tried to move. Tried to stand up. But the handcuffs keeping me bound to the chair wouldn\u2019t budge. My legs were free, but there wasn\u2019t a hell of a lot that I could do with those. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \u201cBut you\u2019ll be different, Raj\u2026\u201d She said, \u201cYou\u2019ll finally be different!\u201d\n\n  \u201cAnd if I\u2019m not?\u201d I asked weakly, dreading the answer.\n\nGloria didn\u2019t respond. She just stared into the empty eye sockets of one of the skulls\u2026 and that seemed like all the answer that I needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \u201cGloria\u2026 please\u2026\u201d I said, \u201cYou have to understand how insane this is, right? I mean\u2026 come on, you can\u2019t just keep me down here!\u201d\n\n  \u201cAnd I won\u2019t. I don\u2019t intend to keep you trapped down here forever, dear\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t do to treat my husband like that, would it? Once I know you\u2019ll behave, you\u2019ll be free to leave that chair,\u201d She assured me. \u201cWe can start with teaching you your proper manners. I don\u2019t expect to have much trouble with that. You\u2019re already quite well spoken. But the last good candidate I had proved\u2026 deceitful. Oh, he said such wonderful things when I had him bound down here. But once he was free, he tried to run from me! I had to move here after that\u2026 a shame. I quite liked my old home. But then again, if I hadn\u2019t moved, I would never have met you, would I?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe grinned and drew closer to me.\n\n  \u201cOh Raj, you\u2019ll be very happy with me. I assure you. I\u2019ll be every bit the girl you need and I will take *very* good care of you. Yes, yes\u2026 even in *that* way, you dirty boy.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe reached over to caress my cheek, still smiling at me as she did.\n\n  \u201cGloria\u2026 no\u2026\u201d I said, but she ignored me.\n\n  \u201cBut first\u2026 you and I will need to spend some time together. Just the two of us. I thought I might tell you about your predecessors\u2026 they were an interesting lot. There are 28 of them in here, you know. 28 failed attempts at love\u2026 it\u2019s a little embarrassing. But, I think you\u2019ll be the one who finally stays.\u201d\n\nShe seemed off in he own little world as she rambled to me about the men she\u2019d killed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \u201cYou\u2019re the most like Nigel, you know\u2026 the others, they were either violent, or they were drunks or they had a wandering eye\u2026 there was always something.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs she spoke, I could do nothing but stare at her, half listening as I tried to think of some way out of this situation. The chair she had me tied to was made of uncomfortable wood and metal. It seemed fairly sturdy. The handcuffs were secured to the chair, and I had no idea how I could get out of them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy legs were free, but it\u2019s not like that would do me any good. The chair was bolted to the floor, making any attempts to move fruitless. I was stuck there. \n\n  \u201cFlorisvaldo, for example. Florisvaldo was my third\u2026 an immigrant. I thought he was so charming at the time. So exotic! But he had a wandering eye. He told me he would be loyal, but his penchant for staring said otherwise. So I thought it only fitting I take his eyes first.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe spoke about the way she\u2019d killed a man with such fondness, as if she were reliving a happy memory. Listening to her talk like that\u2026 I think that\u2019s what really hammered home just how *fucked* I was.\n\n  \u201cOr Theodore. Oh, Theodore was *such* a romantic. He used to take me dancing, just like Nigel did\u2026 do you like to dance, Raj? I\u2019m sure you will soon. Theodore used to be such a great dancer. But when he went out he liked to drink and when he drank too much, he wasn\u2019t a good man anymore. That just wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was going to find a flaw in me. I knew that was just about inevitable. She was going to find a reason to kill me. Maybe it would be because I was too young, maybe it would be because I didn\u2019t like being tied to a chair until stockholm syndrome took hold, maybe I\u2019d say the wrong thing and set her off. Whatever it was, she\u2019d find a reason!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was going to kill me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnless\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy legs were still free. I swallowed uneasily, and decided that I had nothing to lose. \n\n  \u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, Gloria will you just *shut the fuck up?\u201d* \n\nThat got her attention. She went silent, her head snapping to look at me and her eyes narrowing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \u201cExcuse me?\u201d She asked.\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t care about any of your ex boyfriends you evil ball of shit!\u201d I spat. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care about your stupid dead husband! *Get the fuck over it, you whiney fucking bitch!*\u201d\n\nI could see Gloria\u2019s breathing growing more violently. \n\n  \u201cYou are trying to provoke me\u2026\u201d She said, struggling to keep her voice calm. \u201cYou are trying to get me to get angry with you\u2026 but I know that this is a trick.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \u201cIt\u2019s not a trick you fucking ancient whore, you locked me in your fucking basement with your corpse collection! I mean, what the fuck?! You\u2019re just going to up and tell me about how you went and fucked up *every single relationship you\u2019ve ever been in* before fucking murdering the guy? What the fuck is wrong with you? How the fuck do you fuck up dating 28 goddamn people? How fucking unlikeable are you? How the hell did you not find a single other person in however many years it\u2019s been since Nigel died that could tolerate you? Jeez, at this rate I\u2019m not entirely convinced that Nigel isn\u2019t *lucky* to be dead so he doesn\u2019t have to stay married to you!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGloria didn\u2019t reply, but I could see the rage in her eyes.\n\n  \u201cY-y\u2019know maybe I AM trying to provoke you, because right now, getting murdered seems more appealing to me than spending another moment with you! If I\u2019d known this is what would happen, I would\u2019ve let you break your withered old spine hauling the groceries in! I mean hell, you barely got me down here, didn\u2019t you? What, did you throw me down the fucking stairs?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could see her pause for a moment, before shaking her head.\n\n  \u201cStop it, you\u2019re trying to provoke me\u2026\u201d She said, her voice cracking. \u201cYou\u2019re not *like this* Raj!\u201d\n\n  \u201cOh no, I\u2019m *exactly* like this!\u201d I snapped, \u201cI was just being nice because I felt *bad for you* because of how fucking pathetic you looked! But now? Now I don\u2019t give a shit about you, Gloria! *Fuck you!\u201d*\n\n  *\u201cENOUGH!\u201d* She roared. I watched her storm out of the room, before returning with a kitchen knife.\n\n  \u201cIf you\u2019re no better than the rest, then *die like them!\u201d* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe came for me, and I let her do it. I figured that this was going to end in one of two ways and at this point, I was fine with either of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen she was close enough, I kicked up at her as hard as I could. The first kick connected with her knee, and I heard the crack of bone as her leg broke. Gloria screamed as I kicked at her again, hitting her in the stomach this time and sending her crashing to the ground. The knife slipped from her fingers as she landed hard on the concrete floor with a grunt of pain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was silence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGloria was still alive. I could hear her panting. Beneath her dress, I could see that her leg was bent at an odd angle. She tried to drag herself toward the knife, before crying out in pain when she moved her leg.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \u201cNo\u2026\u201d She rasped, \u201cWhat did you do to me\u2026\u201d\n\n  \nI didn\u2019t have an answer for that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGloria kept trying to move, howling with pain every time her broken leg so much as shifted. I could see the tears of pain streaming down her cheeks, before she fixed me in a look of pure hatred.\n\n  \u201cWhy\u2026?\u201d Was all she could ask.\n\n  \u201cI don\u2019t want to die\u2026\u201d Was the only answer I could give.\n\nNow it was her turn to be silent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI watched as she slowly tried to drag herself toward the fallen knife, although she didn\u2019t make much progress. Every little movement seemed to send a fresh jolt of pain through her and when it got to be too much, she\u2019d simply lay there, breathing heavily and refusing to talk to me. The whole time, I just sat there\u2026 and slowly realized that even with Gloria incapacitated, I still had no real escape plan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had no way out of the handcuffs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was still stuck down there with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hours passed by slowly. Gloria would move in small spurts before the pain became too much for her, but she never got very far. Even when she finally made it to the knife, all she really did was clutch it to her chest and lie on the ground, staring at me. At first she looked angry, but as the hours ticked by, that anger faded. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \u201cWere you trying to bait me\u2026?\u201d She finally asked, \u201cWere you just saying those things, Raj?\u201d\n\n  \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d I admitted, \u201cYeah, I was\u2026\u201d\n\n  \u201cThose were some very awful things you said, you know.\u201d\n\n  \u201cYeah, well those were some very awful things you did, Gloria,\u201d I replied. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe scoffed.\n\n  \u201cYou didn\u2019t know those men\u2026 you didn\u2019t have to meet them.\u201d\n\n  \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t have to murder them. So\u2026 yeah, that.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went back to being silent after that, and we didn\u2019t really speak for a while afterward. I imagine that it must have gotten dark at some point. The lack of light made it hard to tell just how much time had passed, but it had to be hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt one point, I saw Gloria\u2019s eyes drift close as she slipped into a restless sleep and I dozed off not too long after that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m not sure how long we slept for. Long enough, I suppose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was still asleep when I woke up\u2026 and so I sat there in silence, looking into the eyes of the skulls that surrounded me, wondering who they\u2019d been. I thought about asking Gloria when she finally woke up, but I wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d tell me or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe basement was silent. The only thing to look at was Gloria and the skulls. Gloria was still alive. I could tell because she was breathing, and because at some point she\u2019d pissed herself and that still seemed relatively fresh. The skulls were not alive, even if the one that still had a relatively fresh face attached to it seemed to move sometimes\u2026 that was probably all in my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \u201cRaj\u2026\u201d Gloria asked me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hadn\u2019t realized that she\u2019d woken up, nor was I sure how long she\u2019d been awake for. How much time had passed, exactly?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.\n\n  \u201cI\u2019m thirsty\u2026\u201d She said. \n\n  \u201cMe too\u2026\u201d \n\n  \u201cRaj\u2026 I can\u2019t get up,\u201d\n\n  \u201cYeah\u2026 neither can I.\u201d\n\nGloria went silent again, before meekly trying to move her leg. She whimpered in pain and stopped. I watched her clutch the knife tightly and for a moment I wondered if she was going to use it on herself and leave me alone in the dark. I was afraid that she might do that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe seemed to be as afraid of what would happen if she did that as I was, even if our fear was for two completely different reasons.\n\n  \u201cI just wanted to be happy again\u2026\u201d Gloria murmured, \u201cThat\u2019s all\u2026\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that, it was back to the silence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think Gloria died sometime during the second night. After I fell asleep again, she didn\u2019t seem to be breathing anymore. I was all alone down there. And I knew that it wouldn\u2019t be long before I died too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sat in that chair, contemplating the skulls around me and watching Gloria\u2019s body, waiting for the moment when I slipped away and joined her. My muscles felt sore and weak. I\u2019d given up my dignity and soiled myself days ago. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hoped I\u2019d die in my sleep, since it seemed less scary than the alternative. So after Gloria died I spent as much time as possible trying to sleep. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn\u2019t. Sometimes I\u2019d imagine that Gloria was still talking to me, although I think those conversations might have been in dreams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m sorry if the details are getting hazy here, everything after Gloria died sort of blurs together. Hell, most of what happened after I broke her leg blurs together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe days went by and I felt myself growing hungrier, thirstier and weaker. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe days went by and I waited to die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I didn\u2019t.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess one of the neighbors got concerned after not seeing Gloria for a few days, so they called for a wellness check. When I heard a voice upstairs, I thought it was another dream. But I called out anyways.\n\n  \u201cI\u2019m down here! I\u2019m in the basement!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I heard the footsteps coming down, and I still thought it was just a dream. It wasn\u2019t until they\u2019d cut me out of the handcuffs and called an ambulance that I knew that this was real.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was still alive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s been a few weeks now. I\u2019ve told the police everything and they\u2019ve taken Gloria\u2019s body and the skulls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t sleep very well at night. When I dream, I dream of the basement and the skulls. I dream of sitting alone in the dark with Gloria\u2019s rotting body, with the stench of my own filth filling my nostrils, hunger gnawing at my stomach and thirst clawing at my throat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy therapist said that talking about what happened might help me. So\u2026 here goes nothing, I guess. Maybe it really will help. Maybe it won\u2019t. All I know is that after everything, I\u2019m still alive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that I\u2019m still alive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m sure that I\u2019m not still in that basement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m sure that I\u2019m safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m sure that I\u2019m free.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m sure\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m sure\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m sure\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Sure\u2026](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre)",

Don't use pain, you'll get addicted and harming yourself isn't healthy. Lemon juice is good, it's very sour and snaps you out of it. Pepper oil is also good and it lingers longer. Helps you keep grounded in reality. Try it, maybe it will help you know you're safe.",

I'm sorry you went through that; you do seem like a good person despite everything. I think you were able to get through to her a little in the end...\n\nYour retelling of your experience was so vivid and absorbing; I could 100% relate to everything you were feeling, even though I've never been in a situation even close to that.",

    "postText": "We sat in front of the small brick building for ten minutes without saying a word. Neither one of us wanted to make the first move, because we knew that when we exited the truck, one way or another, our lives were going to change forever.\n\nDr. Serrano\u2019s office was cozy. When you\u2019re a fertility doctor, I guess you try to make your patients feel as comfortable as possible. We sat in the waiting room, holding hands. It\u2019s not something Grady and I did often, but since we were kids, we knew that holding hands meant we were there for each other...no matter what.\n\nDr. Serrano called us back. We forced the normal pleasantries through the underlying tension in the air. Grady moved his chair closer to mine, so he could hold my hand as we heard the news.\n\n\u201cJoslyn, have you ever had surgery of any kind?\u201d he asked bluntly once we all settled in.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026never,\u201d I replied. Then I looked to Grady who also thought the question was strange.\n\nDr. Serrano looked at us for several seconds, in that way parents look at their children when they\u2019re wondering whether they should believe them or not.\n\nHe looked me straight in the eyes when he finally said, \u201cYou\u2019re missing your uterus.\u201d\n\nIt took Grady and I a moment to comprehend what he said.\n\nThen, Grady blurted out, \u201cMissing? What the hell you mean by missing?\u201d\n\nI squeezed Grady\u2019s fingers\u2026something I did to keep him settled when he got worked up.\n\nDr. Serrano explained to us that he believed I had MRKH\u2026a disorder where a female is born without a uterus.\n\nMy mind filled with a cloud of confusion as he continued on with low and muffled words\u2026\u201cTell me about your periods\u2026\u201d \u201cWhat is intercourse like for you two\u2026\u201d questions that I am glad we were too distraught to answer.  Grady and I felt the answers were none of his business anymore. If I was unable to carry a baby again, then there was no point sharing our intimacies\u2026or our secrets.\n\nThough in a state of grief, we carried on as usual\u2026we had to. We cared for over thirty animals on our land. Being gone for a few hours for a doctor\u2019s appointment meant a full day of catch-up work. We hated catch-up work.\n\nOne night, about two weeks after the doctor\u2019s visit, I was tending to Wanda, a pregnant pig under our care. I touched Wanda\u2019s belly to make sure I felt plenty of movement and that\u2019s when I felt the *warm* in my belly. Usually when I feel the warm, it starts in my face and works it\u2019s way down\u2026stopping at my chest\u2026filling my heart with a feeling of peace that I can\u2019t describe with words. This time though, the warm started in my belly and it just stayed there. Normally, the warm would pass after a minute or so, but this time it stayed for several minutes.\n\nWanda, as big as she was, tried her best to shuffle closer to comfort me. I looked into her eyes and we shared, *knowing*\u2026almost the same way I would share knowing with Grady. She told me to not be frightened and I told her I wasn\u2019t\u2026the warm was always a good feeling - a feeling of comfort and safety. She looked at me with fear in her eyes. I now realize that she knew right then that something other than the warm was coming but she was too frightened to tell me.\n\nLater that same night, I told Grady what had happened when I was with Wanda. He didn\u2019t think it was a big deal except he was very curious about the warm being in my belly and not my head and chest. He wondered what it would feel like in his belly. I knew he was jealous, even though he didn\u2019t say so. He never had to say how he was feeling. I never had to say what I was feeling. Not after that warm Friday night in 1996.\n\nWe were sixteen, on our way home from a late Summer bonfire. It was something we did every Friday night during the school year. We\u2019d watch the varsity football game, go to the bonfire at Lake Lewisville to party with our friends, then head back to the trailer park where we lived. Grady had his own truck and we had parents who really didn\u2019t care what we did as long as we paid our share, so that night, like all nights, it was late when we headed home. It was 3 am.\n\nThe last thing we remember was Grady turning the radio on and only getting static. I looked down at the radio and said, \u201cPop in a tape\u201d \u2026and that was it. The next thing we knew we were upside down in a ditch. We opened our eyes at the same time and looked at each other for several moments without saying a word. We didn\u2019t have to. We knew how the other felt, and that was when our knowing first happened.\n\nSurprisingly unscathed but very confused, we managed to get out of the truck with ease. We walked the rest of the way home as the sun rose, almost three hours after the accident.\n\nThe next morning Grady\u2019s dad lost it when Grady told him the truck was in a ditch but he was glad we didn\u2019t call the cops. Grady\u2019s family was known by the cops to be somewhat of troublemakers, especially Josh, Grady\u2019s older brother.\n\nGrady and I continued to work our after school jobs at the Circle L Ranch as handlers. We eventually saved up enough money for another truck. A year after that, Grady\u2019s dad died unexpectedly. Since Josh was in jail, Grady got his dad\u2019s trailer and truck. We sold the trailer and bought a small piece of land in an even quieter part of town.\n\nOver the course of two years, we built our house, stables and barn. We never really sat down and talked about it but we both knew we wanted animals around us. I think we preferred animals over people for the simple fact that we could never really explain the change in us after that night in 1996 to people. Animals don\u2019t ask questions\u2026well, at least not difficult ones.\n\nMy knowing with animals became clear right away after the accident. Grady didn\u2019t have it but that didn\u2019t seem to bother him much. What did bother him was when the animals would share something with me that they didn\u2019t want Grady knowing. It didn\u2019t happen often but when it did, he would journal in the barn about it for hours.\n\nI became known as the animal whisperer around our small town and as everyone knows, small town people love to talk. Within a short amount of time, farmers and ranchers from all over North Texas came to me to help them with their animals. We bought more land around our existing property and opened *The Blue Mound Sanctuary* when we were in our mid twenties.\n\nWe lived simply. We woke up before the sun to tend to the animals and only spent time with each other after sun down. My favorite memories are the ones of Grady and I watching the Summer sky swirl into sorbet colors at sunset, while we drank his homemade cherry limeades.\n\nWe honestly didn\u2019t speak much with words but we shared all those kinds of special moments together\u2026and that felt like the best kind of talking. Whenever we felt like communicating with someone other than each other, we journaled.\n\nJournaling really helped us once we figured out how to keep thoughts from each other. *Blocking*, we found was the best way to stay together. Before blocking, we\u2019d be more susceptible to fighting or hurting each other.\n\nBack to the beginning of the story\u2026about a month after our visit at Dr. Serrano\u2019s, Grady and I discussed adopting. The discussion got heated when Grady said he wanted a baby whether I carried him or her or not.  I explained to him that I didn\u2019t want a baby unless I got to carry. I remember how special the feeling was to carry a child and I wanted...no, I needed to feel it again.\n\nThe heated discussion turned into an argument before we knew it.  We both felt that the other needed some time to cool-down. Grady went into the barn to journal.  I decided to do the same but take a bath first.\n\nI was soaking in tub, thinking of the night we got into the accident. I remember how happy I was earlier that night when I told Grady that I was pregnant at the bonfire. I replayed the moment over and over again in my mind until it was suddenly interrupted by a feeling in my belly. Not the warm feeling I felt when I was with Wanda. A freeze. A dark freeze that enveloped my mid section\u2026then my whole body. My heart especially, felt like was freezing\u2026and breaking.\n\nWhen the freeze passed after a minute or so, I tried to get out of the tub, but I was suddenly and violently held down by some unseen force. I knew that I was being forced down because I saw the outlines of what looked like several rapture-like claws splashing into the water to hold me down\u2026forcing my head down too. I tried to scream for help but Grady was in the barn, too far to hear me. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I had never been so terrified in my life.\n\nAfter several minutes of fighting to get out of it\u2019s grips, a calm passed over me and my body went warm. That\u2019s when I saw it, the outline of human hands passed through the water and pull me up. At first I thought it was Grady, but when I fully emerged from the water, I looked around and saw nothing. The water was eerily calm as though nothing happened.\n\nI quickly got out of the water, got dressed and went to bed - all while in the state of shock. I was surprised to see that Grady was already in bed and fast asleep. I wondered why he never came in to help me but I was too physically and mentally exhausted to wake him up and ask. I just wanted the day to be over.\n\nThe next morning, while we were tending to one of Wanda\u2019s sick piglets, Grady looked at me like he knew I was keeping something from him.\n\nI blocked my thoughts as he asked me why I took such a long bath the night before. I knew if I told him what happened, all it would do is worry him. Grady had a tendency to worry himself sick when I had episodes. I said I just wanted to stay in a little longer than normal and he replied with, \u201cI wish I could stand a bath for two hours.\u201d *Two hours? Had I spent two hours in the bath? Was that why the water was so calm?*\n\nI knew if he kept asking me what was wrong, I\u2019d end up unblocking him\u2026telling him\u2026then worrying him. To get out of the situation, I told him I\u2019d head to the feed store in town to get some medicine for Pepper, the sick piglet. He looked at me with a sadness that we\u2019re both familiar with. It\u2019s the look when one of us would keep an episode to ourselves for the fear of worrying the other.\n\nI got into our truck and headed to the feed store. It was 105 degrees outside and humid as hell, so I cranked the air up and my favorite Pat Green CD to ease my mind. Yes, I still use CD\u2019s.\n\nAbout five minutes into my trip the truck slowed to a stop right in the middle of the country road. The air and Pat Green turned off and the radio turned on to static. It happened so fast, that my mind had trouble keeping up with the events.\n\nWhen I picked up my mobile phone to call Grady, I heard a strange sound coming from the receiver. I didn\u2019t dial a number nor did a call come in, so I knew whoever or whatever it was, it was not someone or something I wanted to speak to.\n\nI set the phone face down on the passenger seat and calmly tried to open the door\u2026but it was locked. That's when I started to panic. I pulled the handle and pushed the door as hard as I could but it was no use.\n\nJust as I was about to crawl into the back seat to see if I could get out another way, it took hold of me again. I was pushed back into my seat by a force so strong that it pulled my hair back from it\u2019s roots. My face was pushed back so far that my upper lip split in two. Blood poured into my  mouth as I was forced deeper into the seat. After several horrifying moments, my entire body froze.\n\nThe chill started in my belly and quickly spread to my face and feet at the same time. The only thing I was able to move was my eyes. I wish I had closed them.\n\nWhat I saw next made the claws in the bathtub the night before look like kitten paws. The heat in the truck rose so quickly and became so intense that it quivered. Frozen stiff into the seat I watched in horror as the quivering heat formed  an outline of a creature. A creature I can\u2019t compare to anything else that I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s horns, or what I think were horns, were long and curved slightly inward. It\u2019s face was short, wide at the top and narrow at the bottom\u2026it\u2019s arms were long with rapture-like claws at the ends of them\u2026the same claws I saw in the bathtub.\n\nOne of the claws reached over from the passenger seat and grazed my face. Then...whatever it was, smelled me. I felt it take a heavy inhale right at my neck as tears streamed down my face.\n\nAt that moment, all I could think about was Grady and the last moment we spent together. It wasn\u2019t watching the sunset while drinking his homemade cherry limeades. Our last moment together was of me keeping something from him and hurting him. His sad eyes would have been the last thing on my mind if I would have died right then and there. I couldn\u2019t let that happen. I forced myself to speak, in the hopes I could reach the creature and make it stop.\n\nWhen I did speak, I spoke in a voice that was not my own. It was like being in an echo chamber and it was deep and raspy\u2026\u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201d\n\nAfter several horrible moments, through the static of the radio, I heard a sound\u2026I can\u2019t call it a voice because a voice is human and this\u2026it was anything but human.\n\nThe sound said, \u201cYou. Are. Mine.\u201d\n\nEvery cell in my body expelled razors of terror. The static slowly changed into a horrific high screech. It was the sound of millions of souls calling out to me from somewhere as dark and cold as the freeze in my body.\n\nThen, the radio turned completely off. The stillness was louder than any sound on Earth. I shared a moment with the loud stillness before the air and Pat Green turned back on.\n\nSlowly, I felt the freeze travel out of my nose, ears and eyes and I was able to move again. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I knew whatever it was, was gone. I opened the truck door with trembling hands and ran. I\u2019ve never ran so fast in my life.\n\nGrady ran out of the house as I ran up the driveway, he knew something terrible happened. He felt it. I fell into his arms and sobbed. I never wanted him to let me go. He carried me into the house and laid me in bed. He didn\u2019t ask questions. The fear he felt from me scared him just as much as it scared me.\n\nThat night, I woke up to Grady sleeping on a chair by my side\u2026my hand in his.\n\nHe opened his eyes and before I had a chance to say anything he said he had to share something with me. Something that he held onto for far too long.\n\nHe said on that Friday night of 1996, he actually did remember something after we heard the static on the radio. He said he looked up from the radio when I looked down and said, \"Pop in a tape.\"\n\nUp ahead, in the middle of the road, created by the dusty mist and the oncoming headlights of his truck, was a tall horned figure. It stood perfectly still and it\u2019s head was turned in my direction.\n\nGrady's eyes welled with fearful tears as he described the creature to me. He said it was over seven feet tall and it had several long arms with claws at the end of each.\n\nMy heart dropped into the pit of my stomach. I asked him why he kept it from me for so long. He said when he finally remembered what he saw, several months later, he didn\u2019t want to say it out loud... especially to me. He had to block it from me and himself several times a day to make sure he kept the memory away. Saying it, thinking it\u2026might make it true. He felt that sharing what he saw would bring it\u2026whatever it was, closer to me.\n\nI felt a horrifying chill of truth run through my body.  It was true. The creature\u2026it wanted me.\n\nIt took something from me that night in 1996...now it was back for what it left behind.\n\nPlease continue to [\\[PART 2\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13rmgm4/its_come_back_for_what_it_left_behind_in_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)...",

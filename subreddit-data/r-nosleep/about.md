Description:

Nosleep is a place for redditors to share their scary personal experiences. Please read our guidelines in the sidebar/"about" section before proceeding.

Rules:

Posts must be a complete horror story.: Your post must be a story. This means it has to have a plot - something must happen, and then something else must happen as a result. 


All NoSleep posts must contain a meaningful amount of horror and be framed as a scary personal experience.


Even though we are a horror subreddit, we do not accept all forms of horror. Please see the [posting guidelines](https://old.reddit.com/r/nosleep/wiki/posting_guidelines) for examples

Stories must be plausible.: This means that the narrator must be physically and mentally capable of posting and that the events of the story cannot be proven to be false on a large scale. Stories posted in 2nd person or third person omniscient must have a clearly stated believable reason for being written as such.

Multiple stories in one post must be connected.: If you have more than one story to tell in your post, each one should be connected by a central plot element (i.e. each story happened in the same house or to the main character while working a certain job) and be a complete story. If you simply list unrelated events without a connection or narrative, your post will be removed.

Posts must be original stories.: Only post your own original work. Do not post creepypasta or links to scary stories/photos/videos you found online. You may include your own photos and videos as a supplement your story, however, the story cannot rely on these elements.


No piggybacking, "fan fiction", or bandwagon posts. You may not use another author's intellectual property when posting on this subreddit.

Titles must follow specific guidelines.: No tl;dr titles or titles which impersonate another subreddit. The only thing in parentheses or brackets should be the part number of a series.

All series must be marked as such using the "series" flair. Graphic content must be marked with Trigger Warning/NSFW tags and any appropriate flair. This serves as a “trigger warning,” which is there to note certain types of upsetting content.


Series posts must follow specific guidelines.: Series updates must be at least 1000 words and all parts of a series must follow all of r/nosleep's posting guidelines. In particular, each part must have meaningful plot/character progression and meaningful horror content. It cannot be merely an introductory post or filler.


Your series posts should include a link to previous entries and the following entry, if applicable and be marked with a "Series" flair.

Follow all posting guidelines.: Due to limited space, not all of our rules are listed here. In order to ensure that your post does not get removed, be sure to thoroughly read our [complete list of posting guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/wiki/posting_guidelines).

Everything is true here, even if it's not.: Users are to act as though everything is true on r/nosleep and treat it as such in posts and  comments.


No debunking, disbelief, or criticism (constructive or otherwise). If the formatting is off, report the post and mods will address it.


Do not ask for proof or tl;dr's.

Comments must contribute to discussion.: This means no joke comments. It also means your comment should have or make a point.

Be respectful to one another.: 

Do not private message the mods of nosleep regarding any official nosleep matters.: Questions about rules, potential story approval, removals, etc should be directed to modmail and will not be answered if sent privately to individual mods.

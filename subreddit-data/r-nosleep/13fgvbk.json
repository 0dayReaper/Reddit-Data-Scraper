She had already put on her clothes, and her hair was freshly brushed. I got the sense that she was trying to get out of the house before I woke up, and I wasn\u2019t sure if that was because she wanted to let me sleep, or so that she wouldn\u2019t have to deal with me. The latter seemed more plausible. As I got up, she immediately gave me a stern look and quickly exited the room, leaving one corner of the bedspread untucked.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving without Allison, are you?\u201d said her mom.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s still sleeping,\u201d I heard Luna half-whisper.\n\nHer mom barged into the room, and saw me sitting up on the bed. \u201cLuna will take you to breakfast,\u201d she said, then turned to face the hallway. \u201cWon\u2019t you, Luna?\u201d\n\nI put on my shoes and darted out of the house. Luna was slouching against the wall, her fingers pulling on the skin of her arm absentmindedly. Once she saw me, she immediately turned around and started walking. I followed her, keeping myself a few paces back to give her space.\n\nThe food hall was essentially just a big tent made of army green tarps knotted together to form one giant roof held up by rusted beams, and on its far end was a shack that operated as the kitchen. Once we\u2019d gotten breakfast, which was a torn piece of bread and a bowl of grayish gruel for each, Luna escorted me to some rocks nearby, where we sat to eat. I hadn\u2019t felt hunger in so long, but once I got that first bite of bread into my mouth, I couldn\u2019t stop eating. Luna kept quiet, so it seemed to serve her well that I could barely take breaths in between bites, let alone try to spark up a conversation. Everything faded away, and all I could think or feel or do was eat. The gruel was exactly the same as it was back home; monotonous, sticky, and slightly salty. But it might as well have been a festive stew with succulent meat and soft carrots and black pepper; when you\u2019re hungry enough, anything will taste like heaven.\n\nAfter I was done with my meal - and I could have eaten twice the amount I had - my spirits were slightly lifted. My arms and legs had a newfound reserve of energy, and there was finally something to look forward to: the next meal. So uplifted I was, that I decided to bother Luna.\n\n\u201cThis place is kinda like my home. Well, almost exactly like it.\u201d\n\nLuna turned to me with fury in her eyes. She was still eating, and with her mouth full of gruel she said \u201cShut up.\u201d Some of the gruel shot out and splattered on the rocks, which looked kind of funny, but I didn\u2019t laugh. She gulped violently, forcing her mouth to empty its contents. Almost whispering, she said \u201cYou can\u2019t talk about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of the other kids know. About your home, I mean. And they can\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you know.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Duh.*\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\nShe sighed and set the bowl on her lap.\n\n\u201cJohn made this announcement, like, that you\u2019re a foster child or something. That you were rescued from the outside world, and that we need to keep you safe here. You\u2019re like some wounded puppy that needed saving.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t believe that?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to know, or are you gonna let me finish?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, sighing again. \u201cAfter that John came to our house and told me that he needs me to look after you. He said that you\u2019re from another place like this, and that he trusts me enough to tell me all this and keep you in check. Basically he said that I need to keep you from talking your mouth off about your home and whatever else deranged ramblings you might have, and to oversee that you don\u2019t try to jump the fence. I guess my parents already knew all that, since he only gave this spiel to me. *Look* \\- I know that things aren\u2019t as John and the rest of the elders say. I\u2019m not stupid, even though John probably thinks I am. I don\u2019t talk much, and I guess that makes me stupid, according to him, anyway.\u201d\n\nShe then continued eating, which I took as a sign that I wasn\u2019t going to interrupt her.\n\n\u201cAnd you said that you\u2019ll do that?\u201d\n\nAfter another big gulp, she said \u201cOn account of him saying that he\u2019d hurt my mom if I didn\u2019t, *yes*.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t reply. We sat silently until she finished her breakfast.\n\nAfter taking our plates back to the food hall, we started walking back to her house, and once there was nobody else in earshot, I said \u201cYou know it\u2019s possible to get out of here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you done it, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna leave my mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you take her with you?\u201d\n\nLuna\u2019s frustration finally boiled over. She stomped in front of me, forcing me to stop walking and look into her eyes.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d that work out for you, *smartass*? Where\u2019s your mom? What about your dad? Why are you back in a place like the one you just came from, if it\u2019s so fucking easy?\u201d\n\nWith that, she stormed off. I didn\u2019t follow her.\n\nI went back to sit on the rocks. Besides Luna\u2019s house, it was the only familiar spot I had in this new place. I didn\u2019t dare - or want to - talk to anyone else, and besides, everyone seemed to look at me funny. Like I was sick, or something. I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I just sat and stared at nothing; I waited for lunch.\n\nLater, Luna came back. She sat down next to me, and joined me in my staring.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019cha looking at?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cNothing in particular. Just waiting for lunch, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s beans and carrot cake, I think. I kinda like it.\u201d I kept quietly staring.\n\n\u201cSo, did you just fuck up your escape or what?\u201d she asked as she picked up a small rock and started throwing it from one hand to the other.\n\n\u201cSorta, yeah. It\u2019s a long story, but yeah, they caught me. Once they brought me here, John said that he needs me to keep watch of the other kids so they don\u2019t try to escape as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m to watch over you so you won\u2019t escape? John\u2019s a fucker. A dumb fucker, but a fucker anyway.\u201d\n\nI chuckled. Luna was quiet for a while, throwing the rock higher and higher with each pass.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. About earlier, I mean. I guess I thought you were with John and the elders or something. The truth is, I *do* want to get out.\u201d\n\nShe threw the rock into the distance and turned to face me. \u201cYou\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve ever told that. It\u2019s just\u2026 I can\u2019t leave without my mom. Dad? Sure - fuck him, he\u2019s like a mini-John. Actually wants to be like him, one of the elders, I mean. But my mom\u2019s done nothing wrong. She\u2019s a bit harsh sometimes, but she\u2019s always taken care of me. Actually *listened* to me, you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you told her about wanting to get out?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I guess I\u2019m scared she wouldn\u2019t want to, and then maybe something bad would happen to me. Or her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I can try to help you. Help you both.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll figure something out. I did it once already, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about your parents? Did they escape as well?\u201d\n\nThe word parents sent a painful sting to my midriff, twisting my insides. Do I still have parents, or are they no longer your parents if they die? Do I get to decide? Can I erase their memory as *parents*, if I so choose?\n\n\u201cNo. They never escaped.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Luna said.\n\nLunch finally arrived. The carrot cake tasted a lot sweeter here. I think it might\u2019ve had something to do with the soil or the water, maybe it\u2019s different here. The ravaging, food-induced fulfillment I\u2019d experienced during breakfast didn\u2019t return, but at least I got to eat more. It calmed me down, and allowed me to think.\n\nThat evening, Luna even told me \u201cGood night.\u201d I was glad to be on her side.\n\nOnce everyone in the house had fallen asleep, I snuck out of bed, carrying my shoes as I tiptoed my way outside. Once I had my shoes on, I beelined for the nearest part of the fence, and started to look for broken wires and other weak spots. The thought occurred to me that those bird-viewers elder Alston had shown me - *live feeds*, as they called them - might be around here as well, but I hoped the cover of darkness would suffice to keep me out of their reach. And maybe nobody was watching, anyway.\n\nI found a section of fence that was looser than the rest. I prodded a stick I\u2019d found on the ground between the wires, and twisted it, going over each diamond shaped hole, until the wires started to come apart. I sat there for a while, trying to be as quiet as I could, until I\u2019d formed a sizable hole at the bottom of the fence. It was barely big enough for me and Luna to fit through, but if we were to get her mom to come with us, I\u2019d need to come back and widen it. My arms started hurting from all the twisting, and it became increasingly hard to work the fence. I decided to leave it be, and come back the next night. After that, it should be ready.\n\nI sneaked my way back to the house, and took my shoes off before I clambered up the steps to the front door. Once I opened it, it wasn\u2019t dark inside, like it had been when I\u2019d left. Instead, in the glimmering light of an oil lamp, stood elder John.\n\n\u201cCome on in, Allison,\u201d he gestured.\n\nHe closed the door behind me, and escorted me to Luna\u2019s bedroom. Between our beds stood Luna, tucked between her parents. She was crying, looking at the ground. John pushed me to stand next to Luna as her parents retreated alongside John, blocking the doorway. Luna\u2019s dad stared at us, reminding me a twinge of the rage my dad had exuded before. My stomach twisted again. Her mom looked glum, and she seemed to look to John for cues on how to behave; how to approach the situation in the *right* way.\n\n\u201cLuna told me everything. I thought we had an agreement,\u201d said John, his gaze fixated on me. \u201cDid you really think that you could pull this again? That we wouldn\u2019t know? I thought - *I hoped* \\- that you were a *smart girl*.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was my fault,\u201d Luna said, her voice coming in short bursts between erratic, sobbing breaths. \u201cI should\u2019ve kept my eye on her, like you said, elder John.\u201d\n\nJohn scoffed. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in both of you. You\u2019ve let me down immensely. Now, I\u2019m not one to usually condone corporal punishment, but I need to teach you somehow. You need to learn that lying, escaping, and leaving the others is not True Love. It\u2019s the farthest thing from it. And it is not what the One True God wills of us. Do you understand that?\u201d\n\nWe nodded.\n\n\u201c*Good*. But I think you need to be reminded of your actions against True Love. Against us. Fred?\u201d\n\nLuna\u2019s dad stepped forward, and in his hand was a rope tied over itself to resemble a collar. He put it around Luna\u2019s neck, and tightened it until her breath came out in sore puffs.\n\n\u201cPut your head under the bed,\u201d he said.\n\nLuna sobbed and looked her dad in the eyes. She didn\u2019t say anything, but her hands were starting to tremble.\n\n\u201c*NOW!*\u201d\n\nLuna jumped from fright like a deer, and quickly, *shakily*, laid down on the floor on her belly and crawled until her head was under the bed frame. Fred placed the end of the collar on my hand, like it was a leash. He then picked me up and stood me on Luna\u2019s bed. He was strong, and his hands squeezed me so hard my skin was twisted. I could hear Luna\u2019s muffled sobs underneath.\n\n\u201cNow, I want you to pull as hard as you can,\u201d John said.\n\nFeigning my strength, I pulled the rope just enough for Luna\u2019s head to slightly bump on the hard wooden edge of the bed frame.\n\n\u201cCome on, Allison. The way you were twisting that fence open - I *know* you\u2019re stronger than that. Pull again.\u201d\n\nAnd I did. Slightly harder. Luna\u2019s head made a nasty, clopping sound as it hit the bed, and a vile, squishy sound as it dropped back down.\n\n\u201cAgain. Harder.\u201d\n\nAnd I did, again. *Harder*. Luna let out a scream and tried to cover her head with her hands, but Fred quickly jumped in and pulled them back, putting his feet over each hand so she couldn\u2019t move them.\n\n\u201c*Again*.\u201d\n\nI pulled as hard as I could muster, hoping that it would simply knock Luna out and we could be done with this. I wanted to scream *I\u2019m sorry*, but I knew it would only fuel John\u2019s sadism. Luna\u2019s head hit the bed so hard I could feel it vibrate, which was almost immediately ensued by a scrunching, wet sound as her head dropped back to the floor.\n\nAfter that, I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. Everything in my body wanted to twist up inside myself, and I would rather have taken Luna\u2019s place and be smashed to a pulp instead of doing it again. I let go of the leash, and expected to be punished for it.\n\nFred stepped off from Luna\u2019s hands. She didn\u2019t move them. Or her head. She just lay there, and I was sure I had just killed her - and I would be next.\n\nFred pulled her limp body out, and flipped her over. Her face was covered in blood, and the bruises were already starting to appear under the skin. Luna\u2019s mom hurried to get some water, and splashed it on her face. She started coughing, and slowly opened her eyes halfway. She was alive.\n\nI glanced at John. He was smiling, staring at Luna, entranced by the sight of her mangled face. As if he\u2019d been alerted back into reality by an invisible, soundless bell, his chin rose up and he looked at me with puzzlement in his eyes, like he\u2019d just woken up from a really nice dream.\n\n\u201cRemember, I love you both,\u201d he said, his eyes wide with excitement.\n\nJohn nodded at Fred - a statutory sign of approval between men - and then exited the building, like he couldn\u2019t contain his stature as a calm, reverent elder any longer. He looked like he was going to burst into song.\n\nAs I sat down on my bed, Luna\u2019s mom came in with rags and more water. She started cleaning Luna\u2019s face, whispering to her as she did so. Soon she had gathered a pile of bloody rags next to the bed, and finally she helped Luna to a sitting position on the bed. Her face was bumpy and purple, and even after all those rags, there was still a wound on her forehead that leaked blood down to her eyes. I tried to look at her, to somehow signal that I was so sorry, that I don\u2019t deserve her forgiveness, but she wouldn\u2019t look at me. She just stared at the ground, her arms limp beside her. And that\u2019s what I deserved.\n\nHer mom strapped one of the rags around her head to cover the bleeding wound. She brought her some drinking water, and she winced with each sip. Once Luna was cleaned up, she laid her down on her side, and started cleaning up the rags from the floor, using some to suck up the puddle of blood under the bed. Once she was finished, she sat down next to Luna and stroked her arm gently. Her face was achingly devoid of emotion, but I could see tears rolling down her cheeks. Luna soon closed her eyes, and her mom left without even looking at me, closing the door behind her. The ensuing silence was unbearable; I wanted to scream.\n\nWe laid in our beds for a long while. Listening to her breath I knew Luna wasn\u2019t sleeping. She just laid there, and I didn\u2019t dare say a word. I couldn\u2019t sleep either. I didn\u2019t feel like I deserved to rest.\n\n\u201cAllison?\u201d Luna said hoarsely, awakening me from my exhausted, hypnagogic trance. Her voice was calm, yet somehow broken.\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome here.\u201d\n\nI sat on the bed next to her, like her mom had. Whatever she was going to say, I deserved it. She could - *she should* \\- curse me to the ground, and then some. I was ready to steal Fred\u2019s leash and make Luna punish *me*. But then, something completely unknown and unexpected happened; she took my hand. She was too tired to hold it tightly, but I could feel that she tried to. I squeezed back gently and began to cry.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell John,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nI wiped the tears from my face and said \u201cNo, you don\u2019t get to say sorry. *I\u2019m* sorry. It\u2019s *my* fault, all of this. I shouldn\u2019t have gone out - it was stupid of me. So *fucking* stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Luna said. \u201cWhat else could you have done? He would\u2019ve just punished us more if you hadn\u2019t done what he said.\u201d\n\nI stroked her hand softly with my thumb.\n\n\u201cMy dad\u2019s a dick.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but let out a chortling laugh, which I quickly suppressed with a fist in my mouth. Everything had been so serious, life and death, and here was this bloodied and mangled girl who said that her dad\u2019s a *dick*. It was such a mild word to use, so right yet completely unreflecting of the true evil surrounding us. I guess it was wrong to laugh, but Luna quickly joined in. She went between chuckles and saying ow, since moving any muscles in her face seemed to hurt. But we laughed together, and her hand felt warm, and I squeezed it tighter, and so did she.\n\nOnce our laughter subsided, I said \u201cMy dad\u2019s - *was* \\- a dick too.\u201d\n\nLuna let out a laugh through her nose, avoiding the use of her facial muscles, and asked \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe died.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Good.*\u201d\n\nLuna scooched to the far edge of the tiny bed and pulled me down towards her. She put her arm over me, and I could feel her breath sync up with mine as we lay there, nestled together. At some point I started to fall asleep, and I no longer wished to die. Tomorrow was no longer empty; there was breakfast, and then there was *Luna*.",

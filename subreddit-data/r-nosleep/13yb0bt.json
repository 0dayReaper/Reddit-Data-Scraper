    "postText": "I\u2019m an artist. Not one you\u2019ve heard of, though that may be changing soon. Being an artist is about creation, not about commercial success. I wouldn\u2019t mind getting the occasional acceptance mixed in with the constant stream of rejection, of course, but it\u2019s a process.\n\nA long process. They say that most artists don\u2019t become famous until after they\u2019re dead. I\u2019d always hoped that I\u2019d make it slightly before that.\n\nI graduated last year with an MFA from a relatively prestigious institution, along with a dozen other folks who convinced themselves that an insurmountable pile of debt was the best way to jump right into the starving artist lifestyle. We were, as mentioned, a small class, so we all went to each other\u2019s showings and were generally supportive, but I was only really friends with two of the others, Jerrod and Albina.\n\nThe three of us ended up rooming together for the last year of the program, and we kept that going post-graduation. Having other folks in the house who look through the mail with the same mix of hope and trepidation is surprisingly helpful. Alone, it\u2019s easy to simply look at everyone else\u2019s filtered life and assume that you\u2019re the only one failing. When you come down in the morning to find your roommate crying in her cornflakes because her last eleven submissions haven\u2019t even gotten the courtesy of a rejection letter, it\u2019s a little easier to see that this is just how life goes sometimes.\n\nOne of our favorite Friday night activities was going to local galleries to see who they had on display. There were a few reasons for this. One, it gave us a good idea of what they liked to show, helping us hone our own submissions. Two, it was very cathartic to be catty about what had been picked. Three, a lot of the galleries had free hors d\u2019oeuvres and wine.\n\nI guess four, we liked art, but honestly it was hard to remember that sometimes. Sometimes looking at other people\u2019s finished canvases just made me angry. What made them able to decide that they were done? What made other people agree that they were worth hanging on the wall? What justified the astronomical price tags next to them?\n\nI\u2019m not saying that this was anything but jealousy. I\u2019m just saying that art and I are in a complicated relationship.\n\nAbout a month ago, we went to a newly-opened gallery, Souhait. It was the usual setup: tall glass windows in front showcasing the art placed strategically on bright white walls within. It had the standard mix of oddly angled separators allowing the patrons to wander slowly through the room and discover the paintings one at a time. Basically it looked like every other gallery, but as it was a new opening it had better wine than most.\n\nI was taking a casual tour of the perimeter when Jerrod appeared at my elbow.\n\n\u201cHey, congratulations!\u201d he said. \u201cYou weren\u2019t going to tell us? I can\u2019t believe you managed to keep this a secret.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, what?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah, \u2018what\u2019 indeed.\u201d He steered me around several corners to where Albina was admiring a painting. \u201c\u2018There\u2019s a new gallery opening, we should all go, no reason.\u2019 Congrats!\u201d\n\nI stared at the painting in disbelief. It was one of mine.\n\nI was certain that I hadn\u2019t submitted to this gallery. I hadn\u2019t even heard of it until Albina had mentioned that it was opening. I would have remembered receiving a letter of acceptance, and I definitely would have remembered delivering a painting. None of these things had happened.\n\nAnd yet there my art was on the wall. It had my signature, and my name displayed next to it on a card. I knew the piece. I\u2019d done it two or three years ago. It was good, very representative of my style at the time, but I\u2019d moved on and had stopped trying to get it displayed a while ago. The last I had seen it, it was six or seven canvases deep in a stack of pieces that I had nowhere else to put.\n\nIt was fairly obvious that that was not the case now. The proof was on the wall in front of me.\n\nAlbina and Jerrod were both praising me, so I just smiled and made vaguely humble comments. I must have submitted it. It wasn\u2019t like someone had broken into our apartment and stolen a single piece of my art. It was both confusing and concerning that I couldn\u2019t recall offering it to this gallery, but it was the only explanation that made sense.\n\nI was still trying to puzzle this out when another familiar piece caught my eye. I nudged Jerrod. \u201cOh, so I\u2019m the one keeping secrets?\u201d\n\nHe raised an eyebrow at me, and I pointed across the floor. His eyes widened as he saw the same thing I had: one of his paintings neatly framed and prominently displayed.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know you\u2019d finished that one,\u201d I said. \u201cI swear I saw you working on it like two days ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, sounding a bit lost. \u201cI was.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you get the gallery to take it before it was even done?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my God, look!\u201d said Albina.\n\nIn the back corner of the gallery, occupying an entire corner, was a small collection of Albina\u2019s work. It was expertly curated. I\u2019d watched her develop her style for years, and the eight paintings chosen here perfectly encapsulated the entire range. Clusters of people kept gathering in front of them, and I saw more than one slip off to speak to the gallery owner about purchasing a piece.\n\n\u201cAlbi, these are amazing,\u201d I told her after we finally managed to get close enough to see them all properly. \u201cThis\u2014some of these are absolute perfection. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve even seen all of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeriously, when did you do all of this?\u201d asked Jerrod. \u201cSome of these are definitely new. Unless you have a secret studio you\u2019ve been hiding from us?\u201d\n\nHe narrowed his eyes at her in mock suspicion. She laughed, shoving him lightly, but behind her smile I saw the same confusion that I\u2019d heard in Jerrod\u2019s voice, the same that I\u2019d felt myself. None of us knew that our work was going to be on display here. Something was very odd.\n\nWe didn\u2019t talk about it then. Oddity or not, our art and our names were on display, and there were free drinks to toast with. We refilled our glasses, congratulated each other effusively, wandered the gallery for a bit and then did it all again. By the time we were walking home, all concerns had vanished from all of our minds. We were successful! We could figure out how and why later.\n\nThe next morning, Albina was dead.\n\nI woke up late with a hangover. Jerrod woke up later, looking even rougher than I did. There was nothing resembling breakfast anywhere in the apartment, so we sat and sipped our coffee silently. Albina\u2019s door was open, and I think we both hoped that she\u2019d gone out to get bagels or something and that we would shortly be provided for.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t answering texts, and Jerrod and I were just starting to get concerned when there was a knock at the door. We opened it to find a policeman asking if we knew Albina Shevchenko, and if we had contact information for her family, and if we could come identify the body.\n\nIt had been a hit and run. She\u2019d been dead by the time witnesses had gotten to her. No one had seen the car\u2019s license plate. The police didn\u2019t even pretend that there was a chance of justice.\n\nThey gave us her effects, including what remained of a bag of bagels. Somehow that was the worst part for me. She\u2019d gone out to get something to celebrate with us. It made us complicit.\n\nAt the funeral, the priest spoke about her giving spirit and her wonderful personality, but most of all he spoke about her massive artistic talent. He went on at length about what she could have created if she had not had her span cut short. The entire gathering nodded along with him.\n\nJerrod and I exchanged looks. It wasn\u2019t that he was wrong. She was amazing, and eventually the world would have known about her. It\u2019s just that that hadn\u2019t happened yet. The three of us were, as far as we could tell, the only ones really aware of how much potential we had. If everyone knew this about her, why had she been scraping by in a dingy apartment with us, trying to get enough money together to buy more art supplies?\n\n\u201cWe should go back to Souhait,\u201d Jerrod said after the funeral. \u201cThe gallery owner probably doesn\u2019t know. We\u2019ll need to get her pieces back before he trashes them when she doesn\u2019t respond.\u201d\n\nOur trip was unnecessary. The gallery owner had Albina\u2019s obituary blown up to large size and prominently displayed next to a tremendous collection of her work. It covered entire walls of the gallery, each piece with an explanatory card discussing when and why she had painted it. Where the prices had been on the cards, every single one was marked \u201cSOLD.\u201d\n\nI was looking around for the owner to ask where he was sending the money when Jerrod grabbed my arm.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d he said, half-whispering.\n\nArranged in a neat circle on one wall were a dozen of his paintings.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I want to be on display here,\u201d he said. He sounded frightened.\n\n\u201cThen take them back. They\u2019re your pieces.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre they?\u201d He pointed. \u201cI never finished that one. That\u2019s how I wanted it to look, but I couldn\u2019t get it right. I swear I never completed it. And there! I never painted that. I thought of it, I knew it in my head, but I have never put brush to canvas for it. Not even to start it.\n\n\u201cHow could they have any of this? How could anyone?\u201d His voice was rapidly rising toward hysteria.\n\n\u201cHey, let\u2019s get you out of here,\u201d I said, putting an arm around his shoulders. \u201cWe\u2019ll come back tomorrow and get them taken down if you want. We\u2019re all running on fumes right now.\u201d\n\nPrivately, I thought again about the piece that Souhait had of mine. I\u2019d never gotten around to looking for it at the apartment. Things had been a blur since Albi\u2019s death. I wondered how this gallery had so much of our stuff. I wondered what else had been taken.\n\nBack at home, Jerrod rummaged through his artwork, hunting for something.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d he said finally, holding up a canvas. \u201cI told you. It isn\u2019t done.\u201d\n\nHe was holding up something that could have been an early attempt at one of the pieces we\u2019d seen in the gallery. It was the same general idea, but the colors weren\u2019t right and the composition didn\u2019t gel. Also, as he\u2019d said, it was clearly incomplete. Parts of the canvas still showed through in some areas. It wasn\u2019t what was hanging on the walls.\n\n\u201cI told you,\u201d he repeated. \u201cHow can they have art I never finished?\u201d\n\nI tried to get him to calm down. I sat him down on the couch and poured him a drink. We\u2019d go back in the morning, I said. We\u2019d find the owner. We\u2019d sort all of this out. It was a problem for tomorrow, not for this evening. Not right after a funeral.\n\nI thought I\u2019d gotten him to agree with me. I poured us both another drink. Somewhere in the middle of that one, I fell asleep on the couch.\n\nWhen I woke up, Jerrod was gone.\n\nJust one of those things, the police said. Wrong place at the wrong time. He\u2019d been mugged. His credit cards and phone were gone. He\u2019d bled out in the street. He was almost halfway to Souhait.\n\nI went there to get his art taken down, like he\u2019d wanted. They\u2019d already expanded the collection. His photo smiled down at me from the main wall, next to an obituary lauding his talent, his bold innovation, his novelty. The rest of the gallery was plastered with his work. I recognized some of the paintings he\u2019d been rifling through at the apartment the previous day. Most had already been sold.\n\nAnd on the back wall, in a small but well-lit section by themselves, hung six of my paintings. The one that I\u2019d seen the first night was there, along with two others I was particularly proud of. If I\u2019d been asked to pick three pieces to best represent who I was and who I had been as an artist, those might have been them.\n\nThe other three bore my signature, but I did not paint them. Not yet. Like Jerrod, I knew the subject matter in them. I had thought of them, conceived them, and even made some attempts to put them to canvas, but they had never come out like I\u2019d imagined. I\u2019d set them aside to try again later, when I had better supplies, when I was better.\n\nYet here they hung, complete and perfect, exactly as I had pictured them. It was a triumph of my craft.\n\nIt was beautiful to see what I could become, given enough time.\n\nIt\u2019s just too bad that I don\u2019t have it.\n\nMost artists don\u2019t become famous until after they\u2019re dead.\n\n***\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/micahwrites)",

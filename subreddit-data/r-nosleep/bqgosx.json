    "postText": "My sister is a genius. When she was about thirteen she made this device that honestly still blows my mind. I\u2019ve spent my entire life studying physics and I still don\u2019t know what she did, or how\u2014which is probably for the best considering how this all played out. I don\u2019t know how she did it, but what I do know is in the summer of 2003 the laws governing matter and atomic mass didn\u2019t seem to affect her anymore, she was invisible to the human eye, and she was speaking a universal language we\u2019ve never been able to identify or reproduce.\n\nBefore I get into this, though, have you ever seen Firefly?\n\nAllow me to quote:\n\n*I am very smart.*\n\n*I went to the best medic-ed in Osiris, top 3% of my class; finished my internship in eight months. \u2018Gifted\u2019 is the term.*\n\n*So when I tell you that my little sister makes me look like an idiot child, I want you to understand my full meaning.*\n\nThis could have been written about me and my sisters. We come from a long line of gifted people. My father is a neurologist, my mother works for SpaceX, and my eldest sister is an artist whose work has been featured in galleries since she was twelve. I\u2019m a full-time research associate of high energy density physics at a university I can\u2019t name without risking my career. And, like Simon Tam from Firefly before me, I don\u2019t tell you all of this to flaunt our intelligence or to make us look special. I tell you this so you can fully understand what I mean when I say Nirali made us *all* look like idiot children.\n\nIn 2003 I was about to turn seventeen. My interests weren\u2019t like most teen girls, so I won\u2019t bore you with the details of what I found more entertaining than TV, books, or the mall, but more often than not I was occupied with personal research projects. The first time Nirali made herself invisible I was in the middle of a research rabbit hole. I was deep into some really heady academic articles when I heard Nirali pipe up behind me.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re wrong, you know.\u201d\n\nI groaned inwardly. We\u2019d had the knocking talk, but she was still so bad at respecting boundaries. \u201cNirali, what did we say about knocking?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said, and sounded genuinely surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I frowned and spun my chair around to look at her.\n\nMy room was empty.\n\n*Wait, empty?*\n\nI looked around briefly before rubbing my eyes, wondering when I\u2019d slept last and already writing the conversation off as an auditory hallucination. Shaking my head, I started to turn back to my computer when I heard her giggle.\n\n\u201cAlright, jerkhole. Where are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight here,\u201d she giggled, her voice coming from directly in front of me.\n\n\u201cWhat the\u2014how? Did you hide the speakers again?\u201d I stood up, taking a moment to really look around the room. She\u2019d pulled a prank like this before, hiding a complex set of speakers she\u2019d modified to create a confluence of sound she could manipulate. It would sound like someone was anywhere in the room she specified. She\u2019d even made it sound like she was moving around. It was really impressive, especially since she\u2019d only been ten at the time.\n\nThis time, though, she\u2019d either gotten much better at hiding the speakers or something else was going on.\n\nShe giggled again. \u201cNo speakers! Just me!\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, \u2018Just Me\u2019. But how?\u201d I folded my arms, looking in the direction of her disembodied voice.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be hard to explain.\u201d\n\nThat was Nirali for \u201cyou won\u2019t get it\u201d.\n\n\u201cTry me,\u201d I said, because I\u2019m stubborn.\n\nShe did, though, and I didn\u2019t. I had the beginnings of a migraine chewing on my right eye by the time she was done. Almost none of it made sense. There was something about atomic frequencies, and post-dimensional drift, superliminal desynchronization, and something she\u2019d dubbed the \u201cPlanck Supratemporal Parallel\u201d. It was all way over my head.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, rubbing my temple as I tried to digest it all. \u201cBut how did you get here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI walked.\u201d\n\n*Infuriating.*\n\n\u201cI mean, how did you get *in* here?\u201d I gestured widely to the door, which was closed, and the walls around us.\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d I could hear the shrug in her voice. \u201cI just walked where the walls weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nI squinted at the spot I thought she was standing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 what?\u201d\n\nShe sighed. It was a special sigh. It was the kind of sigh that told you someone much smarter than you was put out at having to dumb something down enough for you to understand. An embarrassed heat flooded my cheeks. I knew she was smarter than me\u2014smarter than all of us\u2014but it still made me feel like I\u2019d failed simple math in front of Neil DeGrasse Tyson and a puppy, and they were both disappointed.\n\n\u201cI walked where the walls weren\u2019t. The walls aren\u2019t everywhere, Divya. In fact, in most places, like\u2026 realities? The walls aren\u2019t there at all. So I just walked in those places.\u201d\n\nI wanted to see the proofs of this statement, though I knew she wouldn\u2019t have bothered writing them down except in scraps and incomplete snippets that only made sense to her. I also knew the proofs wouldn\u2019t make any more sense than her original explanation. Even so, it bothered me that I only understood what she meant in the vaguest, most conceptual way. It wasn\u2019t natural for me. That abstractness of thought warred with the linear way of my brain making actual understanding impossible and I hated it.\n\nSana would have understood. Her brain worked that way. But not mine.\n\nI must have looked like I was struggling with it (and I was), because she continued on.\n\n\u201cWhere I am, or technically when and how, everything is a Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s puzzle of Is and Isn\u2019t. All I have to do is observe the places where the state of something Isn\u2019t and go there.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t helping. I mean, it was\u2014I got the basic concept of what she was saying, but in terms of the practical application of physics it was a mess of meaningless sciencey buzz words. Nothing she said had any foundation in known science. She could have told me \u201cI ate ice cream upside down and chanted \u2018purple\u2019 backwards thirty times and the wall turned to Jell-O, but only as long as I looked at it from a forty-five-degree angle,\u201d and it would have been exactly as scientifically sound as what she\u2019d actually said.\n\nYet she was the one who was invisible, so the limits of my understanding and science itself had no bearing on her corporeal existence.\n\n\u201cDo you still have a body? I mean, can you see you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d she said, her voice pitched higher in excitement. \u201cI look like a hundred versions of me laid on top of each other. Looking at my hands and stuff is kinda trippy, but I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nCool. I had no idea what to do with this information.\n\nShe started giggling again.\n\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you haven\u2019t noticed yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoticed what?\u201d I couldn\u2019t keep the flash of irritation out of my voice. It wasn\u2019t easy to accept the premise that she\u2019d managed to trick physics into letting her pass through matter while being imperceptible to the human eye, but I\u2019d had just about all the *How Much Dumber Than Nirali Are You* I could take for one day.\n\n\u201cWhat language am I speaking?\u201d\n\nI had to blink at that and think a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s English, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nShe giggled again.\n\n\u201cSay something,\u201d I ordered in my most authoritative Big Sister voice.\n\n\u201c*Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure\u2026*\u201d\n\nIf I concentrated, I could tell the words I she was saying didn\u2019t quite match what I was apparently translating in my head, but I couldn\u2019t hear them for what they were. Except\u2026 \n\n\u201cWait, is that the \u2018*lorem ipsum*\u2019 translation from De finibus bonorum et malorum?\u201d\n\nShe giggled again. \u201cYep! Want me to try something in Hindi?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, a little stunned and more than a little curious. \u201cGo for it.\u201d\n\n\u201c*May He in whose lap shines forth the Daughter of the mountain king, who carries the celestial stream on His head, on whose brow rests the crescent moon, whose throat holds poison and whose breast is support of a huge serpent, and who is adorned by the ashes on His body, may that chief of gods, the Lord of all, the Destroyer of the universe, the omnipresent \u015ahiva, the moon-like \u015aa\u0144kara, ever protect me.*\u201d\n\nI frowned, torn between focusing on the words and trying to identify what she was quoting. I started mouthing some of the words as my mind ran back over them, and gawped a little as recognition settled in. \u201cDid you just quote the Ramcharitmanas\u2019 Ayodhy\u0101 K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d invocation?\u201d\n\nAnother giggle.\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 how? That didn\u2019t sound like Hindi at all!\u201d\n\n\u201cFascinating,\u201d she said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like Hindi when I said it, but I was thinking the Hindi words. What did it sound like to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cEnglish, I guess. I mean, it didn\u2019t *sound* like anything, but I understood you in English.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so cool. Can you actually hear something other than English?\u201d\n\n\u201cKinda. I mean, almost. If I try I can tell the sounds you\u2019re making don\u2019t match the meaning of the words I\u2019m\u2026 not hearing, but understanding? But the meaning overrides everything else so I can\u2019t actually identify individual sounds or phrases.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think you could identify the physical linguistics if we went word by word? It may be the processing of complete phrases prevents the identification of individual phonemes.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said, shrugging, still trapped in awe of this aspect of her discovery. \u201cWe could try it.\u201d\n\nShe had me run her through some general object identification to give me a chance to listen for the sounds she was making and how they differed from the words I knew\u2014the words I was \u201chearing\u201d\u2014but I only ever caught the ghosts of divergent beginnings and ends.\n\nShe thought this was hilarious.\n\nI thought it was magical.\n\nShe started making regular trips to my room in this state, usually after lights out or when our parents were at work. I didn\u2019t blame her for sneaking. Sana wasn\u2019t into the science stuff, and if our parents knew what we\u2019d been up to we\u2019d have been grounded for life, especially since Nirali had already been banned from experimental projects at home. (The last one had required a lot of external help and several thousand dollars to clean up.) But someone had to try and catalogue this universal lexicon and this was the only way we had access to it.\n\nOne night, as we lay awake on the floor naming objects (we\u2019d tried making individual sounds before, but without the intent of meaning behind them there was no divergence), Nirali froze. I couldn\u2019t see her, of course, but something changed. She stilled to the point I worried she\u2019d maybe phased through the floor or something and left me alone. But somehow I still felt her presence along with something sharp and alien I couldn\u2019t identify.\n\n\u201cNirali?\u201d I whispered, cold unease settling on me like snow.\n\n\u201cShh.\u201d It was her, but so quiet I almost missed it. I felt the urgency behind it, though, and hushed to wait in the silence with her.\n\nAs the seconds ticked by a prickling dread crawled across the room. It started at the edges where the shadows were thickest and spread outward, tainting everything it touched including me. My pulse quickened as a primal paranoia sank in. I knew it was just Nirali and me, but it felt like a predator was stalking the shadows, searching for us, and it was only our silence that kept it from pouncing.\n\nTo keep the paranoia at bay, I focused on the warm red readout of the clock above my desk. The slowly changing numbers were soothing and hypnotic. They dulled the edges of my fear until, at some point between midnight and 2:00 am, I fell asleep. I only realized this when Nirali finally whispered my name, pulling me back to reality.\n\n\u201cDivya, wake up\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d I swam back to consciousness slowly, shaking off the half-formed discomfort of a dream I couldn\u2019t remember.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s gone?\u201d I rubbed the sleep still clogging my vision and blinked at the clock above my desk. So late\u2026 had we really been laying on the floor for two hours?\n\nNirali didn\u2019t answer. Not for a long time. Long enough that I thought maybe I\u2019d dreamed her waking me up, entirely.\n\n\u201cThe shadow behind the walls,\u201d she whispered, cutting the silence away like cobwebs. There was a weight to her words I couldn\u2019t describe that tickled the primal centers of my brain again; an ancient urge calling to me, telling me to hide.\n\n\u201cThe\u2026 what?\u201d I croaked, propping myself up on my elbows, but Nirali was gone. Not just quiet. There was a difference in the room when she left, and I could always sense it. Even if she didn\u2019t say she was going.\n\nA few minutes later she was at my bedroom door actually knocking. The sound startled me, giving my heart a sudden workout with a spike of adrenaline. I snuck over to the door to let her in, too keenly aware of the night around me and jumping at shadows I suddenly worried couldn\u2019t be trusted. Without a word she slipped past me and crawled into bed, hiding beneath the covers with her knees against the wall and her back to me. I took my cue as it was offered and crawled in behind her, offering myself as protection against the night.\n\nSleep was slow in coming as my body flushed the survival instinct from its veins, but eventually it must have come as the next thing I knew the sun was peeking through the windows and Nirali was watching me sleep.\n\n\u201cDivya?\u201d Nirali said my name like she was testing it, as if she didn\u2019t expect to hear it again.\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, curling back under the covers before adding, \u201cthanks.\u201d\n\nIt was a week before she came to me through the walls again.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s drawn to the language,\u201d she said, pulling me out of a dream about superfluid.\n\n\u201cWhat is,\u201d I yawned, oddly comfortable with the resumption of our nightly conversations.\n\n\u201cThe shadow behind the walls.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Something big. Something old. Older than time, maybe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the Sana talk? \u2018Older than time\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Divya, that\u2019s just what it feels like.\u201d\n\nShe was always like this, caught somewhere between science and emotion, like the perfect cross between me and Sana. I think it allowed her to think abstractly enough to escape the box of The Known to innovate, while remaining linear enough to build a new box to house her innovations. But sometimes it meant she didn\u2019t have the math to back it up. Sometimes it was just a feeling or the hint of a notion, but even then Nirali\u2019s feelings were always spot on, even if it took science a few decades to prove it.\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d I said, accepting that answer.\n\nIt was odd, I realized then, how a few weeks of exposure to what my mind told me was factually impossible opened me to the flexibility of The Possible. I was surprised, too, when I noticed my first instinct wasn\u2019t to challenge her or demand proof just because what she said was beyond my experience or immediate comprehension. Instead, I would nod and accept that what she said\u2014what she experienced\u2014was simply truth and the limitations of my understanding couldn\u2019t change that.\n\n\u201cWhat does it want?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think it talks. But, I think it listens. And understands.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 unsettling,\u201d I said, shifting under the covers. The superstitious child in me made sure my feet were hidden in the center of the bed because the shadows still couldn\u2019t be trusted.\n\nShe hummed her agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s not the only thing here, though.\u201d\n\nA chill surged through me, prompting my heart into a panicked gallop. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean there are other things. Big things. Old things. Most of them can\u2019t see me, I think. I\u2019m not really where they are, same as I\u2019m not really where you are, but they can hear me, same as you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you safe?\u201d\n\nNirali was silent. My stomach churned, because I knew it meant something big, and old, and dangerous was near enough to pose a threat. After several minutes passed, she answered.\n\n\u201cSometimes\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly sometimes?\u201d I sat up, staring at the spot on the floor where she would have been seated.\n\n\u201cOnly sometimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why are we still doing this, Nirali?? I wouldn\u2019t have agreed if I knew you were in danger!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cBut there\u2019s so much here. If I focus on a color I can experience everything that color has ever been and ever will be. If I think about a time, I\u2019m sitting in what used to be here or sometimes what *will* be here, watching a blur of activity that won\u2019t happen for another thousand years. I\u2019ve seen cities you can\u2019t even begin to imagine made of glittering bone and glass. Monolithic wonders to shame the gods. Last night I was standing in the center of a black hole. Not a hologram or a simulation, but an actual black hole. Captured, contained, reproduced, harnessed, I don\u2019t know what, but it was here and so was I and through the black hole I saw so many other universes, all laid out like mirrors into infinity.\u201d\n\n\u201cNirali,\u201d I whispered, both awed and terrified. Had she been experiencing these things every night? All the hours we talked about nothing and nonsense?\n\n\u201cBut there are also bigger things,\u201d she said, her voice dipping into darkness. \u201cThings that hide in the glint of starlight on glass. Things that follow me back from the future and wait for me in the past. They skip like stones on water, only touching the surface for a minute and never with their whole selves. But even that much is too much. It hurts to look at them. They\u2019re too many shapes at once and all of them are hungry in ways I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nTears welled in my eyes as I listened to her. It hurt to accept these things as truth. I couldn\u2019t understand them or touch them or even experience them myself, but I had to accept they were real, because my sister was invisible. She could pass through matter at will and spoke a universal language to me every night. But accepting all that also meant accepting that my sister spent every night compelled by her own curiosity to go back to this dangerous state again and again, only to be terrified by what waited In Between.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad they can\u2019t see me, but I don\u2019t think that will be true much longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shadow behind the walls has been in my room all week. I can feel it following me around. It\u2019s listening now, but I don\u2019t think it will come in your room again.\u201d\n\n\u201cNene! You have to stop this!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said, her voice thick with imminent tears.\n\n\u201cOf course you can. Just come back and we\u2019ll destroy whatever you\u2019ve been using to shift. We can fix this.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, the word wet and bent beneath an anguish no thirteen-year-old should have known. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat could possibly be worth the risk??\u201d\n\nMy heart broke in the silence that stretched between us. An eternity of pain and longing swirled between us and one final fragile breath spoke of the tears she held back when she found her voice again.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak English anymore.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t understand. Like the first time she described the math to me this statement defied understanding.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t speak English anymore?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean I can\u2019t speak anything but this stupid Between language, Divya. I tried and tried all week, but all that comes out now is this ugly mess of gurgles and scrapes and noises I don\u2019t recognize and I\u2019m so scared. I\u2019m so scared, because they can still hear me when I\u2019m out there with you and out there I\u2019m not invisible. And you, and Sana, and mom and dad aren\u2019t invisible. And none of us are safe when I\u2019m out there. And the only time I can talk right is when I\u2019m in here,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cWhen I\u2019m here with you.\u201d\n\nMy heart turned somersaults in my stomach. I let this happen. I should have stopped her the day she showed me her stupid science-shattering trick.\n\n\u201cNene,\u201d I whispered, and all I wanted to do was hold her until everything was right. \u201cYou have to come back. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll do to fix this, but you can\u2019t stay there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said through a heavy veil of tears. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to lose you. To lose us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou still have me!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I won\u2019t out there! Not like this.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t have a good answer for her. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way to fix it,\u201d was all I could say, and we both knew it wasn\u2019t enough. We also knew that it had to be, because we didn\u2019t have a choice.\n\nI felt her presence fade and a few minutes later there was a quiet knock at my door. Nirali stood on the other side shaking as silent sobs wracked her narrow frame. I gathered her up, shutting the door behind her, and together we curled around each other on the floor and cried. We cried until we passed out from exhaustion and woke up long after the sun had risen.\n\nI woke to Nirali watching me again and blinked away the haze of tear-stained sleep.\n\n\u201cNirali?\u201d\n\nShe nodded, mute; a sadness hanging over her shoulders.\n\n\u201cCan you\u2026?\u201d\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\u201cNothing?\u201d\n\nShe glanced up, looking over me and toward the hall as someone passed by. I could tell a million thoughts were flitting through her head in that moment, most of them conflicting, but after a minute or so a stony resolution had settled in her eyes and she scooted closer, waving for me to do the same.\n\nHer mouth was almost against my ear when something unimaginably foul rattled from her lips.\n\nA shudder of revulsion rocked through me at the sound of each mangled phoneme. I\u2019ve never been so disgusted and terrified in my life. I could hear her voice, but it was dripping with caustic venom, dragging over hot coals, buried in the deepest ocean and clawing at the edges of sanity with angry talons. It was wrong. And to this day it was the most vile, viscerally upsetting experience of my life.\n\nThe words, this language, was never meant to be spoken by man. Science won\u2019t support me, but I know in my bones these words have power man wasn\u2019t meant to use. \n\nAnd yet, despite my mind rebelling from the mere sound of her voice warped around these hideous words, I still knew what she\u2019d meant as if she\u2019d said it in English. \n\n[*Don\u2019t tell mom and dad.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathByProxy/comments/bqlim4/my_sister_discovered_a_universal_language_meta/)",

Unless your sister's language center in the brain was affected and any attempt at speech/writing would result in... that? Would actual sound have to be involved?

Hard to put into a visual medium, but it's that weird scene at the end of Interstellar if you remember.\n\nThe language, though...that's more intriguing. It sounds like both a memetic or infohazard and some kind of signal or beacon to what I'm assuming are entities existing in even higher spatial dimensions that would be perceived as \"shadows\" to an observer in the fourth dimension. Some kind of fundamental element...hell, what if it's not \"language\" at all? It sounds like you might be dealing with pure information, something inherent to reality itself. \n\nThink of the universe in all its dimensions (the entirety of reality) as one giant computer. Everything you do with a computer is, at a fundamental physical, hardware level, binary. Bits. 1s and 0s. But for all but the simplest of computers, we use layers of languages because working in binary isn't something the human mind can really do. Punch cards, machine code, COBOL, Python...you get the idea. But when it comes down to a CPU executing a function, it runs in binary. So this \"universal language\" may well be the equivalent of binary for reality, interpreted by your brain as understandable language.\n\nTL;DR: I think the kid is speaking in \"universe-binary\", and your brain is reading/interpreting it as...well, basically ASCII or Unicode.",

She was speaking in a celestial language in a corporeal form and it was corrupted that way, like putting a CD on a record player. Maybe she can alter herself, become a Jesus or Krishna, a human who can go to heaven and bring part of it here?",

    "postText": "This is Col. Jacob Wayne of the United States Air Force. If you\u2019re reading this right now, it is very important that you keep reading until the end. It should take three to five minutes, and it is extremely important that you read carefully and follow the instructions provided.\n\nHumor me if you must, but please don\u2019t look away until you've finished reading. Oh, and please try to stay calm. Any increase in your stress levels will draw Their attention.\n\nErgo, I won\u2019t go into detail as to how you got where you are. How you got here isn\u2019t as important as getting you out. Believe me when I say we are working on that right now. The best way to help yourself is to keep reading. Don\u2019t scan ahead. Don\u2019t read out loud. Just read.\n\nRight now, you\u2019re probably thinking back on the past few days and nothing felt out of the ordinary. You went about your regular daily activities with nothing unusual to report. That\u2019s because They are very good, so good most people don\u2019t even realize they\u2019re in the simulation. \n\nEven as our code works its way deeper into Their program, They are monitoring you. So please, remain calm.\n\nIt was tricky, but we found a way in to communicate directly with you. We had to embed this message into your daily routine so it didn\u2019t draw Their attention.  You\u2019re probably reading this on Reddit, Facebook, or some other social media site. Might even be in an email forward or a book, we don't know. We can\u2019t control how the message gets to you; we only know that you are receiving it. \n\nSubliminally, as your eyes are passing over these words, a code is being uploaded into your brain. Think of it as a computer virus, or in this case, an antivirus. Your brain is an organic computer, and They exploited that. They hacked right into your subconscious mind and overwrote it with Their simulation code. That\u2019s how They got in, and that\u2019s why everything appears normal. You might think that you\u2019re going about your daily life, but in reality you\u2019re strapped to a table with tubes sticking out of your body.\n\nNow that the code is uploading, you may begin to feel some sensations. For example, one ear might feel slightly warmer than the other. You might even feel an itch or tickle. Don\u2019t scratch, just let it be. Ignore the dull background hum you might hear as well. That\u2019s Their program. If They catch on before our code has time to work They will abort the simulation. If that happens, you will be lost to us forever.\n\nOh, and don\u2019t be alarmed, but by now They realize we are in Their system. You may notice some small changes, specifically a slight shortness of breath or that you have to control your breathing manually. This is normal. \n\nWe know from other communication attempts that whenever They discover a code break in, the first system They power down is the one controlling your breathing. Thankfully, even in the simulation you are capable of breathing manually. Try it. Breathe in. Breathe out. Inhale. Exhale. \n\nAwesome.\n\nYou\u2019re doing just fine.\n\nThey\u2019ve probably figured out there\u2019s a glitch, but if our code is working we\u2019ve disabled Their ability to do a hard reboot. Because of this, They will try other methods to disrupt the upload. It is very important that you ignore anything that might draw your attention from these words. If They pull you away before the upload completes it will delete our code. Block them out. Ignore the movements you see in your peripheral vision. Those sounds you hear, the voices, they aren\u2019t family, friends, or coworkers in need of attention. They may even try to use your pets. They know your weaknesses.\n\nOverlook the notifications popping up on your screen if you're on a phone or computer. Block them all out until you finish reading. It\u2019s just another way They\u2019ll try to break our communication link.\n\nEvidently, if our code is working, the next thing you\u2019ll notice is an overwhelming urge to swallow. You don\u2019t realize it, but there\u2019s a feeding tube down your throat. You'll only know it's there because your tongue won\u2019t rest comfortably in your mouth. You might also become hyper aware of the amount of saliva being produced. Don\u2019t overreact. If you have to swallow, just swallow. It\u2019s only weird if you make it weird.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re still reading this, the code upload is about 90% complete. We\u2019ve locked onto your location. You\u2019re doing great, but you\u2019re really going to need to focus now. Once the upload is complete there will be instructions you will need to follow to exit the simulation. That is, if you\u2019ve followed the instructions and haven\u2019t looked away.\n\nComplicating matters is the fact that They now know we\u2019re here, and They know what we\u2019re doing. Their attempts to divert your attention through the simulation proved unsuccessful, so now They\u2019re going to use your body\u2019s systems against you. THEY ARE IN YOUR BRAIN. They want you to blink. Don\u2019t blink. Your life depends on keeping your eyes open. \n\nAlmost there, just a few paragraphs more until the code upload is complete. Don\u2019t scan down, or up, just keep reading. I got you this far. Stay with me. Eyes open, eyes front, keep them locked on the screen. \n\nPLEASE FOCUS! I don\u2019t want to lose you. I\u2019ve lost so many already. Ignore it all! Block everything out. Ignore that tickle on your scalp and the itch on your arm. That\u2019s them, attempting a manual override. Don\u2019t give up now, you\u2019ve made it this far. FIGHT IT. You\u2019re almost there. Just follow the instructions below and we can get you out.\n\nEmbedded in this text are the steps you need to follow to unplug from the simulation. If we did this correctly, the first letter of each paragraph will tell you what you need to do. DON'T LOOK YET. The upload still needs to finish. I hope you didn't look. \n\nUpload complete. We\u2019ve done everything we can on this end.\n\nSee you on the other side.\n\n\n***\n[credits](https://www.reddit.com/user/writechriswrite/comments/9t5h8z/end_of_the_line/)",

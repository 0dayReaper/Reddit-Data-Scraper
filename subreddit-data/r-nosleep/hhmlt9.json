    "postText": "Samantha told me about it on our third date. We were watching a movie on her couch when I made my move to kiss her. She whipped her hand in front of my face and blocked me.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something you need to know,\u201d she said.\n\nI braced myself. *Here it comes. \u201cI\u2019m not ready for a relationship. Nothing to do with you, of course.\u201d* It was the absolute last thing that I wanted to hear, because I was already crazy about her.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI have a removable face.\u201d\n\n*That\u2019s a new one.* \u201cYou have a what now?\u201d I was about to laugh, but she was wearing a deadly serious expression.\n\n\u201cI have a removable face.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that, like, a metaphor or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. My face is literally removable. Look. Closely.\u201d She lifted her chin and traced her jaw line with a finger. \u201cYou can see the seam.\u201d\n\nAfter admiring how beautiful her neck was for a dizzying moment, I leaned in for an inspection. It was very hard to see, but it *did* look like there was a slightly unnatural transition there from her face to her throat. I grew dizzier, as a dozen questions rushed into my brain.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother asking why or how or anything like that,\u201d said Samantha. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that. If that\u2019s going to be a problem, you should leave now. I\u2019m letting you know this because I like you, and I want to take the next step, but this is non-negotiable.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, unsure of what was happening. \u201cNot a problem. So what? You have a removable face. Who cares? It looks good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something else. Once a day, usually in the evening, I have to remove the face and disinfect the inside of it. If I don\u2019t, it will rot. This takes about an hour, give or take, depending on how my day went. During this time, you must never *ever* look at my real face. *Never*. Do you understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cY\u2026 yes. Got it. Don\u2019t ask about it, don\u2019t look at your\u2026 \u2018real\u2019 face.\u201d\n\nSamantha stood up. \u201cNow, I\u2019m going to go into the bathroom and clean my face. That will give you plenty of time to think about what I\u2019ve told you. If you\u2019re here when I\u2019m done\u2026 that\u2019s great. I would like that. But if you\u2019re gone\u2026 I\u2019ll understand.\u201d\n\nShe turned and walked into her bedroom. I sat in stunned silence as I heard the bathroom door close.\n\nI gave the thing some serious thought. It was possible that it was a joke of some kind. It was possible that it was a delusion. Was it possible that it was true? Well, it was certainly possible to transform an actor\u2019s face with movie makeup, so I supposed it was possible that Samantha wore a \u201cremovable face\u201d every day. Maybe she had had a horrible accident where her flesh had been mangled. Maybe her face had been melted by acid, or burned by fire, or the skin shorn off by heavy machinery. If it had, I would never know, because she would never tell me, and I would never see it.\n\nI pictured a face of raw, naked muscle, rotting away. Could I kiss her, if that was what I was kissing? But wasn\u2019t that what we all were, under the skin? Just muscle and bone and blood and squishy organs.\n\nI paced around the living room, running my hand through my hair. I liked Samantha, a lot. She was smart, and funny\u2026 and beautiful. But was that beauty *real*? Did it count? Did it matter if it was \u201creal\u201d or not? Was I being superficial even worrying about it?\n\nWhen she came out of the bathroom, I was still there. I looked at her face. She smiled and I was in love.\n\n\\*\n\nWe dated, we moved in together, we decided to get married.\n\nFor the most part, it was a completely normal relationship, typical of two young people in love, building a life together. During the day, it was easy to forget about the face altogether. It looked natural enough, and only in certain positions, in certain lights, was there ever any indication that it *wasn\u2019t* natural.\n\nBut every night was the same. Samantha would close herself in the bathroom \u2013 sometimes for an hour, sometimes for two \u2013 and clean the inside of her face. The curiosity never left me. I would sit there and wonder what was under that face. I came so close to barging in on her a few times, but I never did.\n\nI *did* occasionally ask her about it. About what, if anything, had happened. About how it was possible to make the removable face look so real. About what it really looked like underneath. I tried to coax her into showing me, assuring her that I loved her no matter what, and didn\u2019t give a damn what her real face looked like\u2026 I was just curious, that\u2019s all.\n\nShe never showed me, or told me the story behind it. She didn\u2019t get upset at me (unless I was really badgering her.) She\u2019d just shrug and say, \u201cYou know you can\u2019t see it. You know I can\u2019t tell you about it.\u201d\n\n\\*\n\nI never told anybody about Samantha\u2019s removable face. It\u2019s not that she asked me not to. I just didn\u2019t think it was anybody\u2019s business.\n\nExcept once, I did tell somebody.\n\nIt was during my bachelor\u2019s party. We had rented several cabins in Big Sur and spent the night drinking and packing our noses with powders that we shouldn\u2019t have been packing our noses with. Everyone else had passed out and the sun was creeping up behind us as I stood on the majestic cliffs with my friend Chris, looking down on the pacific waves crashing against the rocks.\n\nChris was my best friend; as close to a brother as I\u2019d known. We\u2019d grown up together, and visited each other at college often, and spent the summers together. After college, we\u2019d moved to different cities, but we stayed in close contact.\n\nStanding there on the cliffs, I told Chris about Samantha\u2019s removable face. At first, he thought I was joking. Then he had a thousand questions, most of which I couldn\u2019t answer.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s underneath?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, man. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t that drive you crazy, not knowing?\u201d\n\nI shrugged. \u201cLots of stuff I don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t know how to do calculus, and I don\u2019t know what happens when we die.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut dude, she\u2019s about to be your *wife*. And you don\u2019t even know what she *looks like*. I mean, I\u2019d have to take a look. Like, you could set a camera up in the bathroom. That\u2019s where she does it, right? Set up a camera and have a look and then you\u2019ll know.\u201d\n\nI sighed. \u201cYeah, it drives me crazy. I\u2019ve asked her a million times. But she told me I could never look. Gotta respect that, man, even if I don\u2019t like it. That\u2019s love.\u201d\n\nChris laughed. \u201c*You* telling *me* to respect a woman? Up is down now.\u201d\n\nThen we fell back into talking about old times as a new day dawned.\n\n\\*\n\nChris was in town for business last week, and planned on spending the weekend at our house. The conversation at Big Sur had happened four years ago, and we hadn\u2019t spoken about Samantha\u2019s removable face since, despite keeping in close contact and seeing each other as often as two people transforming into adults in different parts of the country can.\n\nIt happened on Saturday evening. We were lounging lazily in the backyard, deep into the beer, having just finished with some grilled steaks, when I got a text from work.\n\n\u201cGoddammit,\u201d I groaned. \u201cI have to make a work call.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d said Samantha, raising an artificial eyebrow. \u201cOn a Saturday night?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy biggest client, baby. Sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is what it is, I guess,\u201d said my wife. \u201cI\u2019m going to head inside and get cleaned up. Chris? Are you okay just hanging out for a bit?\u201d\n\nChris smiled. \u201cI'll be fine. Got my beer, got some weeds to pull in your garden. God knows your lazy-ass husband isn\u2019t going to do it. Those tomatoes are choking to death. It\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d\n\nI rolled my eyes and went into the side yard to make my call.\n\n15 minutes into it, I heard the screams coming from inside. Both my best friend and my wife were wailing in terror.\n\nI dropped the phone and ran into the house and down the hall to our bedroom. Through the open door, I could see that the door to the master bathroom was also standing open.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t come in!\u201d screamed Samantha. \u201cI don\u2019t have my face on! Call an ambulance! He looked! Oh God, he looked!\u201d She sounded desperate, and truly horrified. That made me desperate and horrified, and I wanted to rush into the bathroom, but I knew suddenly that that would be a mistake.\n\nI knew suddenly that Samantha didn\u2019t want me to look at her real face not out of a sense of vanity, but for my own safety.\n\nChris staggered backwards, out of the bathroom. He was holding a straightened out paperclip, which he had used to pick the privacy lock. Now he was stabbing it again and again into his eyes, shouting gibberish. He was clearly in the depths of madness, and it turned my stomach to see him mutilate himself.\n\n\u201cCall a fucking ambulance!\u201d my wife screamed. \u201cDon\u2019t come in here! He fucking LOOKED!\u201d\n\nI turned and ran back to the side yard, where my phone was lying in the newly mowed grass. My client was still on the line, alarmed, asking what was happening, what all the screaming was. I hung up on him and called 911.\n\nWhen the paramedics arrived, Chris was having a seizure in the hallway. Samantha was stroking his head, sobbing. Her face was on, but it had been done hastily, and everything looked a little off.\n\n\\*\n\nMy world has been dark this past week.\n\nMy best friend is in a psychiatric hospital under suicide watch. He\u2019s completely blind and mostly catatonic, except when he slips into a violent, babbling mania. The doctors are optimistic that his state is temporary, but they don\u2019t know the truth about what caused it, because I told the paramedics that Chris had taken a large dose of psychedelic mushrooms and fallen into psychosis.\n\nI saw no good reason to tell the truth about what had happened. Who would believe that one look at my wife\u2019s \u201creal\u201d face would make somebody insane? At best, we would be the subjects of a long investigation; at worst, we would have to prove that what we were saying was true, by showing somebody Samantha\u2019s face. Then the same thing would happen again, and what after that? I had no idea, and no interest in finding out. For Samantha\u2019s part, I knew that she would never consent to show anybody her real face, no matter what the consequences of refusal were.\n\nI did get a follow-up call from the police, asking me to confirm my story. The hospital found no traces of psilocybin in Chris\u2019 blood, though that\u2019s not unheard of, since it has a short half-life. If they end up testing his hair, I will likely be in a lot of trouble. But that\u2019s truly the least of my concerns.\n\nSamantha is in a state of her own. She still cleans the inside of her face, though not as regularly, and when she puts it back on, it\u2019s always crooked now. It is beginning to smell a little bit.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to assure her that it wasn\u2019t her fault. \u201cHe *knew*,\u201d I said. \u201cI told him that nobody was ever allowed to look at it. He *knew* and then he *broke into the bathroom.* This is not on you, baby. Please. Talk to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot on me? That one look at my fucking *face* makes people insane? Please. I just need some time alone.\u201d\n\nAs for me, I am doing my best to hold it together. Do you know what\u2019s strange, though? Despite what happened to Chris, I still find myself curious about what my wife\u2019s real face looks like. More curious than ever, really.",

I think you need to ask your wife to be honest one more time though - or at least, as her if you or she would be in any danger if she explained. If so, ask if there's any danger in describing what the consequences would be. Whatever the rules are, I think you need to know as much as possible if you ever plan on having kids with this lady... what if whatever's going on there isn't from an accident at all, but is rooted in something else all together? What if she has some condition that she passes along to your kids? \n\nAt the very least, maybe she'll agree to let you look through the filter of a camera - not direct exposure to... whatever is under there. But if not, and if you want to have kids together, I think you need to look. You gotta know what you're getting your kids into before having them, after all. \n\nIf she does tell you anything, I'm curious - what happens if her face rots? Can she get another one, or... if the face is already starting to smell, is that a forever thing? Yikes. Have you ever met her parents? I'd assume so - what do they say about it? Siblings or other family? What are their faces like?\n\nAs a last ditch idea, maybe you could do a search of obscure Internet forums; they say there's one for everything. Whether it's medical or congenital, there's gotta be more people like her. Maybe you can get an idea by lurking in some forums.\n\nThis is really interesting to read... I'd very much like it if you wrote more about this situation. I'm eager to find out what's under there, and if her condition is unique or not. Please update us!",

The second reason is to do with chris going into a seizure. Chris was already told about the removable face, so he would have expected a skinless, fleshy face with muscle strands and visible bones.  For a person to have a seizure just by seeing this seems a bit over the top. Someone would actually go into seizure by seeing something other worldy/extraterrestrial that his brain cannot process and scare the living shit out of him which could lead to a seizure]",

    "postText": "I had three things on my mind walking home.\n\nFirstly, figuring out how to get a ride back home. My best guess was that I was a good thirty minute drive from any type of civilization. There was a small possibility a car might come along from across the distance, but the chance they were heading in the same direction I was, was even slimmer.\n\nI mean, I could probably manage to hotwire a car back at the [farmhouse](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13y0vsu/im_a_homicide_detective_i_am_in_way_over_my_head/). But I didn't want to go back there. Not yet.\n\nThe second thing on my mind was my lack of shoes. The rocks were tough and sharp under my feet, scraping them raw with every aching footstep. I had settled on walking on the muddy, yet less painful, grass on the side. But I still wondered why. Of all the thing the man at the table could've taken from me, he took shoes.\n\nIt was a pretty clear answer, however. Mental games. He hires someone to drop me off in the middle of nowhere, with no feasible way of getting back. He knew the first thing I'd want to do is leave. So he took my shoes. He gave me two options, and he wanted to make one that displeased him hurt me, even if it was only in a small, petty way.\n\n*Mental games.*\n\nThe last thing was that I had messed up. Badly. I had continually played into the man at the table's hand. He had always been two steps ahead of me and in hindsight, it was foolish of me to go confront him. I suppose I had visions of bravado, and of revenge, but all I had to show for it was one less arm, and a dead friend.\n\nI can admit that I shouldn't have done that. But I can also change. One short phone call to the police, and I'd get rid of this nightmare. I had an address. I had a confession. I had evidence. And I had made up my mind. No longer I would face all this by myself.\n\nI pulled my phone out of my pocket and dialed 911. No service. Great.\n\nI continued walking for another twenty minutes, before I heard the roar of a car engine behind me. I turned around. There was a car peeking over the horizon, coming from where I came from, and going the direction I was going. Perfect. It was an old blue Chevy, that rumbled across the gravel, kicking up a plume of dust as it went.\n\nI stuck my thumb out.\n\nIn that moment, I probably didn't look like someone you'd want to pick of the road, with missing shoes and only one arm, and all. But there was no harm in trying. I was hoping it was a kind farmer from hereabouts, heading to the main town to do some weekly shopping. The Chevy made its way to me, and I saw the driver eye me up and down, before pulling onto the shoulder of the road.\n\nI opened the door and hopped into the passengers side, thanking the driver. He shifted his position to look at me. Well, rather look *past* me. He had short, cropped hair, three-day stubble, and a faraway look in his eyes, as if he couldn't rest his gaze, or if he was always searching into the distance.\n\nIt was the paramedic, from earlier.\n\nI opened the door and got out. I wasn't doing this again. I would rather walk home. The paramedic drove forward a bit, cutting me off from the road, so that I would have to walk around his car to go forwards. I stopped walking. The paramedic got out of his car.\n\n\"Hey, Jonathan.\" He said, waving.\n\nI didn't respond.\n\nHe moved forward towards me and extended a hand. I didn't accept it. He held it there for an uncomfortably long period of time, before placing it back by his side. \"Look. We got of on the wrong foot here. The name's Michael. It's a pleasure to meet you again.\"\n\n\"The pleasure's all yours.\" I said, dripping with distaste.\n\nHe looked forward, his gaze shifting in and out of focus. \"So. . .uh. You called 911. I can't let you do that.\"\n\n\"How did you know that?\" I questioned.\n\nHe shrugged. \"GPS tracker. In your arm. Shows us your location, and interferes with phone signals as well. Took the liberty of inserting it when you were out cold.\"\n\n*It wasn't a service signal problem, then.*\n\nHe shifted position, and leaned against his car. \"So, I'm going to set it to you straight. Come back with us. You obviously can't be trusted to not go back to the police. Let's make this fair. We're not here to hurt you. You said you'd work for us. Come back, Jonathan.\"\n\n\"And how would you stop me from going?\" I said, tensing up for a fight.\n\nHe shook his head, looking hurt. He grabbed his keys from his pocket, and pressed a button connected to the keychain. I fell down in pain, as a sharp buzzing sensation shook my body, the intensity increasing ever few seconds.\n\nMichael let go off the button. \"I forgot to mention. The tracker also doubles as a. . .safety precaution. You just experienced setting three. Trust me, you wouldn't like setting eight.\" He tapped his eyes. \"Messes up your internal hardware, as I'm sure you've noticed. Setting ten straight up kills you.\"\n\nI automatically looked at my right arm. Inside of it, somewhere, was a small death machine.\n\n\"So, Jonathan. Will you come back?\"\n\nI didn't have much of a choice.\n\nThe drive back was uneventful, and spent mostly in silence. Every time Michael tried to start a conversation, I brushed him of with one word answers. I wanted to make it clear I didn't want to be here.\n\nHe pulled up the small driveway towards the farmhouse. The man at the table was sitting on the porch waiting for me. He knew I was coming. He tells me I have a choice in whether I leave or not, but I never really did. The illusion of choice.\n\n*Mental games.*\n\nHe stood up to greet me as I got out of the car. \"Jonathan! You're back! I am so glad to see you!\" He waved me inside. \"Come on in. I've got so much to tell you! The others are eating breakfast.\"\n\nI walked in with him, towards the dining room where I had first met him. Seated around the table, there was a large group of nineteen people eating bacon and eggs, and various other breakfast items.\n\nI knew most of them.\n\nThere was Sgt Langley, slathering some butter on bread. She smiled and waved at me as I came in.\n\nEddison was sitting beside her, pouring milk into a glass. He turned away from me, not wanting to look me in the eyes, I suppose. He was embarrassed to be here.\n\nThere was various other people I had seen in my time in the field,. Other paramedics and police officers, politicians, journalists, doctors and surgeons. All sharing a pleasant meal together. In the house of a murderer.\n\nThe man clapped his hands from behind me. \"Ok, everyone! Let's make Jonathan feel welcome around here. He's the latest Keeper, but we're still expecting many more\"\n\n\"Welcome, Jonathan.\" A unison of voices said.\n\nI scanned the room, my throat dry and constricted. This was too much.\n\nThe man walked away and beckoned me towards him. He continued to walk through the house, pointing out every room, and giving a rundown of the layout. A kitchen, two living rooms, and three bathrooms spread across two stories. There was also a couple of bedrooms inside, but it seemed to me everyone was sleeping in tents outside.\n\nHe then took me down to the basement. \"This is where the magic happens.\" He said, with a wink.\n\nIt was as I left it. A large operating table covered in dried blood filled the middle of the room. It was surrounded with various machinery, and tools. It was a stark contrast between a sterile IV machine on one side, and a rusted saw hanging of a nail on the other. And in the middle of it all were cameras, set up on tripods around the room.\n\nI inspected one more closely. \"What are the cameras for?\" I asked.\n\nThe man chuckled slightly. \"How else do you think I get the money to pay for all of this?\"\n\nI turned around to face him, the cogs clicking in my head. \"You. . .sell videos of people being tortured.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"You get it. Torture porn is extremely popular in some places of the internet. It's not the main reason I do this, of course. But it helps the cause. The video of your arm being sold, for example, was sold for just shy of five thousand.\" He clasped his eyes behind his back, seemingly very pleased with himself. \"I cut paid to cut off a few legs, and then I have the money to cut off more than just legs. It's an endless cycle. It's perfect. You've seen firsthand the fruits of this system.\" He nodded towards the door on the side, still marked with *elephant.*\n\nHe continued. \"That's where I keep my work-in-progresses. Of course, it's empty now. Which is a shame. He was shaping up to be my best elephant yet. No matter, we've got a cat picked out and coming in soon.\"\n\nI shuddered at the way he talked about Thompson with such blas\u00e9. As if what had happened to him was a natural, everyday occurrence. It sickened me. There was no way somebody could do this all day, and believe themselves to be good.\n\nThere was something else as well, burning in the back of my mind. \"You said before that the night my sister was kidnapped, she was doing something that I didn't know. What was it?\"\n\nHe was silent for a moment. \"How close were you with your sister?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"Close enough. We talked about once a month, and came over every Christmas.\"\n\n\"Do you know what she did for work?\"\n\n\"Yeah. She was studying something. Some sort of advanced anesthetic. She never worked it out, however.\"\n\n\"She did.\" He simply said. He waited for me to process that before continuing. \"I met Alice on an online forum. From the beginning, she fascinated me. She talked about how the world was corrupt and poisoned by humanity, and her ideas for rebirth and restoration. She had plans, Jonathan. So many plans. Everything you see here is a result of her work. We met up at one point and clicked. She was perfect. She was smart. And she was mine.\"\n\n\"Then. . .why did you kill her?\" I asked.\n\nI could see his eyes clouding up, as if he was on the verge of tears. \"Her anesthetic didn't work as intended. Instead of removing pain, it increased it. The way it truly works is beyond me, but even a little dose causes the most unimaginable pain. It feels as if your body is being removed from the inside and replaced with fire, atom by atom. Death would be preferable. But that's the thing, the anesthetic one small side-effect. It's downright impossible to die when the effects take hold. You just have to endure through the pain.\"\n\n\"So all the people I saw. . .?\" I let my question trail of.\n\n\"It's easy to manipulate someone's body when they don't have the strength to retaliate, nor the capability to die.\" He paused, his body quivering with each shaky breath. \"Alice wanted to be the first. She wanted to be the pioneer as the world transitioned into her vision. I begged her not to, as there were other, more suitable candidates. But she insisted.\n\nAnd so we staged a kidnapping. There was no evidence because there was no struggle. There was nothing. She came to this farmhouse, and was the first person to be operated on that table. I spent years placing toothpicks in her skin, while she was drugged up under her special anesthetic. She pushed through the pain, and continued to talk to me. Sharing ideas that I would have never thought possible.\n\nShe told me to find others. In places of power. And if they wouldn't join willingly, then find a way to force them. Soon enough, they would come to realize we're working for the benefit of humanity. She told me to create animal-human hybrids to begin with. An evolution of our species. And the last thing she told me, before I laid her to rest in a park, was to find you. To hire you. To change your vision. And here you are.\"\n\nI stood in silence. I, in fact, didn't know what to say. Everything that I though I knew about my sister was shattered in an instant. It was possible the man was lying. There was no way she really was a some sort of insane fanatical, hell-bent on torturing people.\n\nIt just wasn't the person I knew.\n\nAnd yet, everything made sense. I didn't want to believe him, but I didn't see any way that I couldn't. He was right, and I knew it.\n\nThe man looked back at me. \"Come, Jonathan. I've got one more thing you need to see.\"\n\nHe led me up, out of the basement, and through the back door. He led me past a large vegetable garden, and rows upon rows of tents, most of them unoccupied.\n\n*They were expecting many more.*\n\nI followed him past a fireplace, with upturned stumps placed in a circle around it, to the large barn behind the farmhouse. It was painted a classic red with a sloping roof, and white barn doors. I could hear various noises emanating from inside, different loud sounds, moans, and scrapes, seemingly as if a large machine was inside.\n\nOr a large number of people.\n\n\"This,\" The man said, gesturing at the barn. \"Is my crowning achievement. My life's work. It is the beginning of the vision that Alice had for the world. This is where your induction will take place, and you will become a fully fledged Keeper. You will learn to be a bringer of justice, and a waymaker into the new world.\"\n\nHe walked in front of me, and opened the large doors., letting me take a glimpse inside. It was dark and musky. \"Welcome, Jonathan.\" He exclaimed. \"To the human zoo!\"\n\nI stepped inside.\n\nThe smell hit me like a tidal wave. It smelled strongly of blood and fetid remains that permeated the air like a blanket. It gave me a nauseous feeling, and sent my head whirling, as it tried to breathe in clean air. It was no use. I felt a rush of bile spill out of my stomach and into my throat. I turned to the side and threw up onto the floor. And judging by the mess down there, I was not the first.\n\nThere was rows upon rows of cages, all lined up from wall to wall. In each cage there seemed to be. . .someone, and by the looks of it, most of them were already dead. Each cage was labeled with a different creature name. There was a *worm,* who had all of her limbs removed, and seemed to have segmented body parts every couple of inches, and was forced to crawl around by using her head as an anchor.\n\nThere was various *dogs* and *cats*, long needles inserted into the cheeks in place of whiskers, they had everything below their elbows and knees removed, forcing them to walk on all fours. Other human-animals had parts of their bodies elongated or exaggerate, turning them into various creatures. It didn't seem possible to look like that and *live.*\n\nAll of the inhabitants of the human zoo were filthy and ragged, cramped up in small living conditions and forced to eat small portions of what looked to be rotting meat, only fit for animals. When I walked past, they looked up at me with sorrowful, pleading eyes. They wanted freedom, just like Thompson. They were broken and they were hurt. But they seemed resigned to the fact that they were going to live out the rest of their lives here. There was no resistance in any of them. There was no struggle. They had all given up. \n\nThis place was hell.\n\nIt was hard to think clearly, the smell continued to invade my brain, and dampening my vision with black patches. My heart was pounding in my chest, a result of the horrors that laid before me. I couldn't breath. I couldn't move. This was all too much. \n\nThe man continued walking forwards. \"This is where I hold all current specimens, before I decide to release them into captivity. And this is where you and all the other Keepers will work, feeding the specimens, continuing their evolution, and cleaning their chambers.\"\n\nMy blood boiled. He didn't care about the pain he caused. Nothing fazed him. \"You're treating people like animals! This is inhumane!\" I yelled at him.\n\nHe looked at me with disappointment. \"Look at them. They *are* animals. This is all for the cause, anyways. Later on they will be glad to learn that they were the first steps in the evolution of humanity.\"\n\nHe led me forwards, until we ended up at a massive hole in the floor, in the middle of the barn. It was about ten meters in diameter, and the bottom seemed to stretch downwards for five or so meters. There didn't seem to be any way in or out. \n\nThe man spoke. \"This is where every Keeper before you has proved themselves worthy of Keeper status. Your induction begins now.\"\n\nI felt a large shove on my back. The momentum carried my body over the edge of the hole, with my feet quickly following suit. In an instant reflex, I covered my head with the nook of my remaining arm, and leaned forward, hoping to catch the grunt of the fall on my knees, before rolling away.\n\nI landed with a large thump, which sent volts of pain rippling through my body, and spread me flat across the ground. I laid there, still. The breath was taken out of my lungs, and my knees felt if they had shattered. I tilted my head up, to get a clearer look at where I was. A small, dusty hole, in the middle of a barn where people went to die. Nothing special about it.\n\nThere was movement in the corner of my vision. \n\nIt was something circling me, walking with a slight strut, and over-the-top movements, as if it was hard to stay balanced. Every step it made caused a sharp clacking sound to echo throughout the hole. I slowly got up, despite the pain. I swiveled my body to the side to get a better look, even if it was under dim light.\n\nThe first thing that made itself clear was that the thing had no neck. Its head ended at its shoulders. The second thing was that it had no eyelids. It stared at me with large, unblinking eyes, taking in every movement. The third was the sharp, steel talons that protruded from every fingertip.\n\nAnd then it opened its wings. It spread its arms out wide, to reveal a quilt-work of human flesh stitched together under its arms. It looked at me for a few moments, head cocked, arms in a display of aggression, then it swiveled its head around. A full one hundred-and-eighty degrees. I was looking at a human owl.\n\nThe owl lunged forward, talons aimed directly at my chest. I lunged to the side, fearing for my life once more since the past few days. I wasn't fast enough. Its talons ripped through my clothes like butter, and left three large gashes across my chest. I ignored the pain, and immediately turned around to face the owl. The penalty for letting my guard down would be death.\n\nThe owl was still facing the inner wall of the hole. It twisted its head around to face me, its large eyes looking at me with an intense hatred. I panicked, and hopped backwards, aiming to avoid another attack from the owl. But then I came to my senses. If I was going to survive, I knew I had to make a move right away. The longer I tarried, the weaker I would become, and the lower my chances of living through this would become.\n\nI threw myself at one of its wings, hoping to bring the owl down. It avoided me. In a lapse of judgement, I forgot to realize there was still a human under all of that, wanting to avoid death as much as I did. I rolled backwards, and leaped to my feet. The owl lunged at me again, talons extended.  My first instinct was to dodge once more, but I suppressed it. The owl would be expecting that. I instead waited until the last moment, and threw myself into the steadily approaching owl.\n\nI caught it off guard. \n\nThe owl flailed backwards, stumbling under my weight. I dug my fingers in the small gap between its head and shoulders, and started tearing of the stitches that held them together. The owl continued to thrash, realizing what I was doing. It dropped to the ground, and tried to claw me of its back, but couldn't reach because of its wings.\n\nI continued to tear. One after another. I could feel the tension loosening. Another couple minutes of this, and I would be home free. The owl's movements started to decrease in intensity, and hit seemed to realize the battle had been won. I removed on last stitch, and the rest of the owl's head came of easily, dripping with blood. \n\nI threw it to the ground and collapsed, exhausted.\n\nI woke up in one of the bedrooms. My chest hurt like hell. I sat up in the bed, and pulled the covers away. There was three large scars across my chest, painful and tender to the touch, but obviously treated by someone. I looked outside a nearby window. It was the dead of night. I couldn't hear any noises inside, so I assumed everyone was outside in a tent, sleeping. Everyone except the man. He was sitting in the chair, and simply watching me sleep.\n\n*Mind games.*\n\nHe looked at me as I stood up and raised an eyebrow. I began to walk over to him, despite the pain. He  clasped his hands together. \"Well done. You are now a Keeper.\"\n\nI continued my slow journey.\n\n\"You asked me once what my main purpose was in doing all this. It's for everyone. You. Me. All the peoples of earth. Humanity is *the* highest lifeform. I am treating it as such. With my guidance, and your help, humanity will enter a new era. A new evolution.\"\n\nI still made my way towards him. *Everyone's outside. I'm alone with him.*\n\n\"This was your sister's vision, and then it became mine. I am eager to see it become yours.\" He tensed up in his chair slightly. \"This is not the only human zoo out there, we have spread our philosophy, and we are many. But go ahead, kill me. Continue the cycle. You will follow your sister's footsteps and lead the world into salvation.\"\n\nI didn't think about it twice. I grabbed a vase of the bedside table and ran at him, weapon raised. There was a flash of fear in his eyes. Clearly, he didn't actually expect me to do that. He wasted precious seconds fumbling for his key chain.\n\nI swung the vase onto his head.\n\nHe pressed a button on his keychain.\n\nThe jolt of electricity struck my entire body. The pain was so much worse then I had previously experienced. Each separate buzz sent my entire body thrashing against itself. I tried to push past the pain, and get a hold of the button, but I couldn't move by myself, let alone think. \n\n*Setting ten will straight up kill you.* \n\nMy vision turned a searing white. I could feel my organs vibrating within myself. The pain was endless and unrelenting. This was how I went. The electricity was frying my insides, turning it into a liquid mush.\n\nAnd then it stopped. It took a while to regain my vision, but even then it was unfocused and blurry. The man was still lying on the ground, breathing but unconscious. Pieces of the vase were still ingrained into his skull, sending small trickles of blood down his face. I removed one and slit his throat. It wasn't the death he deserved, considering all that he did.\n\nBut it was what he got.\n\nI stumbled out of the room, to see Eddison pouring what looked like to be gasoline on the floor. I tensed up, ready for another fight. He put the gasoline can down and put his hands up.\n\n\"Hey, man. You can relax. I'm the one who helped you out there. You would have died if it wasn't for me.\"\n\nI scanned his face, and I believed him. I put my fist down. \n\nHe continued. \"I hated it here as well, but I could never find an opportunity to strike back. What you did was very brave.\"\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I asked.\n\n\"Blowing up this fucking hellhole.\" He simply said.\n\nWe worked together for a few hours, silently and in the dark. He had almost finished with the farmhouse, so we moved onto the barn, and finished with the tents. We ended up at Michael's car, and Eddison handed me a lit match. Signifying that he wanted me to do it.\n\nI didn't give a damn anymore. Everything could burn.\n\nI threw the match into a puddle of gasoline, and quickly drove of with Eddison, before the small fire turned into a raging inferno. We were about two miles out when the night sky was lit up in a burst of white light. \n\n*It was done.*\n\nEddison turned to me. \"Where are we going, then?\"\n\nI gazed into the rearview mirror, watching the horizon be engulfed in flame. There was the wail of firetrucks moving in from the distance. Someone must have called it in. I looked forward, at the gravel road in front of me, pondering the question.\n\n\"Home.\"\n\n[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/ineedabettersub/)",

    "postText": "\u201cHuh?\u201d I asked, pulling off one side of my headphones.\n\n*\u201cI said I like your boots,\u201d* the man repeated.\n\n\u201cOh, thank you.\u201d\n\n*\u201cI had a bunch of pairs exactly like \u2018em for years and years\u2014a good workin boot, ya know?\u201d*\n\n\u201cThey definitely are, I use them every day on the job.\u201d\n\n*\u201cWhere\u2019s that at?\u201d*\n\n\u201cTurner Construction.\u201d\n\n*\u201cAh, yes, yes. You\u2019re building that big ole\u2019 thing up on East Avenue, ain\u2019t ya?\u201d*\n\n\u201cYes, sir. It\u2019s going to be one of the biggest in the city.\u201d\n\n*\u201cSo it seems. I used to do construction too, ya know? That was way back in the day. I started back when your mama was probably a toddler.\u201d*\n\n\u201cOh, yeah? With a company, or freelance, or\u2026?\u201d\n\n*\u201cMy papa had a small construction and carpentry business. He hired me on when I was, oh, maybe 15 or so. That was all the way back in 1962! We built houses, mostly, a couple small apartment complexes\u2014nothin as big as what you\u2019re working on.\u201d*\n\n\u201cDid you like it?\u201d\n\n*\u201cBoy, you bet your ass I did. Workin all day was a free gym membership! Ha! Plus, all the perks that came with it.\u201d*\n\n\u201cPerks?\u201d\n\nHe smiled. *\u201cCan ya keep a secret, boy?\u201d*\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n*\u201cYou ever play in a construction site as a child? When I was a lil\u2019 one, me and my buddies would sneak into houses being built and explore \u2018em. Maybe break a couple bottles here and there.\u201d*\n\n\u201cYeah! My neighbors and I used to do that when I was a kid. My house was one of the first built in our neighborhood, then the rest came later. We probably explored every house on the block before they were finished\u2014when they were just wood skeletons\u2014maybe breaking a couple bottles too, to tell you the truth.\u201d\n\n*\u201cOf course ya did. Who wouldn\u2019t, given the opportunity? But that\u2019s all the childish stuff. The real perks came later in life, when I was an adult.\u201d*\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\n*\u201cOh yes, boy. Imagine this. The year is 1980 with no cell phones in sight. You talk up a pretty lady at the local bar and hit it off. You tell her about your new construction project, and she wants to go see it.\u201d*\n\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d\n\n*\u201cWell then ya take her there! You and her all alone in a skeleton of a home, as you said.\u201d*\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be a little more private back at your own house?\u201d\n\n*\u201cMore private, sure, maybe. But much messier.\u201d*\n\nI paused. \u201cHow so?\u201d\n\n*\u201cWell, you don\u2019t just take a girly down to a construction site at night just to get your diddly fiddled with. You take her for... ya know.\u201d*\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n*\u201cFor the easy disposal, boy.\u201d*\n\n\u201cDisposal\u2026?\u201d\n\n*\u201cYa cut the girly up, or do whatever your preference is. Ya do whatever ya wanna do with her, and ya put her under the house. Ya bury her and your stained clothes under there too. Once the job\u2019s done, no one\u2019ll ever see that stuff again. It\u2019s gone. Eventually, a brand new house is sitting on top of your deed.\u201d*\n\nThe bus rolled to a stop.\n\n*\u201cWell, this is my stop.\u201d* He stood, patted my shoulder, and I recoiled. He walked off the bus.\n\nThe only thing running through my mind was a memory. I was a kid, no older than six. My friends and I were playing hide and seek. I hid in the crawl space under my front porch, and when I was hiding, I found a pair of boots half-buried in the dirt.\n\nThe exact same type of boots I was wearing then, on the bus. The exact same type of boots we\u2019d found in the crawl spaces of every house in our neighborhood.",

Saying a few houses away from the bar was a party happening with his friends at one of his places. \u201cIt\u2019s not ready for someone to move into yet, so it\u2019s the perfect place for the house party\u201d\n\nI know exactly where it was and his exact description... it happened three years ago, and I\u2019m going to look into it immediately... I really hope this isn\u2019t going to become real. There were so many hammers, knives and tools everywhere and almost every floor was just dirt.... \n\nThis is an amazing warning story i will share as much as I can, but oh my god...",

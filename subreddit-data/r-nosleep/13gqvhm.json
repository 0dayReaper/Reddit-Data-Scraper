    "postText": "The first thing I saw when I opened my eyes was the bright glare of an overhead lamp. After a few seconds of dull confusion, panic set in when I realized I couldn\u2019t possibly be in my own bed. I tried to jolt upwards, but found that my body was completely paralyzed. I couldn\u2019t speak or scream or even voluntarily control my own breathing.\n\nThe only things I could move were my eyes. As they adjusted to the bright light above me, I was just able to make out enough detail to realize that I was in an operating theatre of some kind. Had I been in an accident? I strained my simultaneously drowsy yet adrenaline-shocked brain to remember how I could have ended up here.\n\nI was just barely able to recall a slim young man with slicked black hair and blue eyes. I had been on a trip and ran into him at the hotel bar. During our conversation, he mentioned that he distilled his own whiskey with home-grown corn. It sounded intriguing, and he told me that he had a small bottle of it back in his hotel room. He said that I was free to try a glass, and if it pleased me, he could arrange for me to purchase some.\n\nHe had been charming and affable, and with his slight frame I didn\u2019t deem him much of a threat to me personally, so I followed him back to his room.\n\nThen I felt a syringe being plunged into my back, and everything went dark before I could so much as utter a whimper in protest.\n\nSomeone repositioned the swivel light so that it wasn\u2019t pointed directly at me, and I could see that the operating theatre was ancient, likely dating back to the turn of the twentieth century. Instead of the sterile white that would be expected in any modern medical facility, everything here was browned and yellowed and stained with time. There was wood where there should have been ceramic tiles, and cast iron where there should have been stainless steel. It was decrepit, but not quite derelict. Someone had kept the place functional, and given my present circumstances, their motives couldn\u2019t possibly be innocent.\n\nThe tiered rows of seats that encircled me were all dimly lit, but I could tell there were figures sitting in them. I could discern no details, so they were all merely humanoid silhouettes to me. They moved only slightly, and I thought that here and there I could catch the light reflecting in their eyes, but they were a deathly quiet lot. There was no whispering, no coughing, and I couldn\u2019t even be sure they were breathing.\n\nSqueaking wheels and the bellows of a respirator began to creep towards me, and from the periphery of my vision, I witnessed a brain in a bubbling jar slide up beside me. It was mounted on some kind of antique pedestal, with a gramophone horn, tesla coil, and all matter of steampunk-looking contraptions built into it. The oddest thing about it was that there was a bowler hat placed on top of the jar.\n\nAt least, that was the oddest thing until it spoke.\n\n\u201cWelcome, welcome, scholars and students of forbidden gnosis and the damned sciences. *Ave Ophion Orbis Ouroboros*!\u201d a voice boomed from the gramophone horn as the brain bobbed and flickered in a strange blue light with every syllable.\n\n\u201c*Ave Ophion Orbis Ouroboros*!\u201d the audience murmured in unison.\n\n\u201cThank you all for coming. For those that don\u2019t know me, I am High Adderman Professor Whitaker C. Crowley of the Harrowick Chapterhouse; Preternaturalist, Parapsychologist, Crypto-anatomist, Alchemical Consultant, and \u2013 when the occasion calls for it \u2013 enthusiastic vivisectionist! For your education and entertainment, tonight I will be demonstrating the neuro-ethereal functions of the human brain with this fully paralyzed, yet fully conscious, test subject. Though he cannot move an inch to save his life, he can see, hear, and most especially feel everything that happens here tonight. Whether or not he\u2019ll survive or be in any mental state to remember any of this when it\u2019s over is\u2026 uncertain at best.\n\n\u201cOf course, due to my physical limitations, I will not be performing this vivisection alone. Assisting me tonight will be Master Addermen James and Mary Darling.\u201d\n\nThe audience began murmuring amongst themselves, the names evidently meaning more to them than they did to me. I heard footsteps crossing the wooden floor, and when they stopped, I saw the young man from earlier standing beside my bed. He wore a blood-stained leather apron over a dark Howie lab coat, his cloth mask drawing focus to his gleaming and gleeful blue eyes.\n\nBy his side stood a young woman so much like him that she could only be his sister. She had the same pitch-black hair, worn in bunches, and the same striking blue eyes that glittered with a manic psychosis. She was dressed in a red and white nurse\u2019s uniform from a bygone era that I couldn\u2019t quite place, and was likely just intended to look old-fashioned without actually belonging to any actual time period.\n\n\u201cPlease, please, there\u2019s no need for concern,\u201d Crowley said, trying to assuage the misgivings his audience apparently had with the visiting surgeons. \u201cIt\u2019s the Darlings we have to thank for bringing us this test subject in the first place. I\u2019d like to remind you all that the Darling Twins are fellow members of the Ophion Occult Order, and you are all to treat them with the respect that they\u2019re due. I\u2019m aware that they don\u2019t technically possess any formal medical training, but their extensive self-taught knowledge of human anatomy should prove quite useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always found that the difference between a butcher and a back alley surgeon was one of entrepreneurship,\u201d James added.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly the sort of amoral heterodoxy I like to see in my colleagues!\u201d Crowley heartily agreed. \u201cI do however feel the need to point out that your personal protective equipment is simultaneously inadequate and, given the circumstances, not strictly necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mainly for show. I like to get into the part,\u201d James said, holding up a pair of hands clad in old leather gloves that were surely far more unsanitary than any bare hands could ever be.\n\n\u201cAnd so do I, just not as much as I like to drink and smoke,\u201d Mary said, and I saw her raise a martini glass to her unmasked face and take a sip. \u201cOh, that reminds me. Professor Crowley, I\u2019d like to apologize for you having the misfortune of witnessing me during one of my rare lapses into sobriety at our last encounter. I want to assure you that that dreadful experience was enough to knock me back off that horrible wagon and I\u2019m proud to say that I have not been sober since.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 good information to have, I suppose,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cTo be blunt, your cannibalistic tendencies are a far greater concern to me than your proclivity for inebriation. I trust you\u2019re able to refrain from entering your \u2018Wendigo psychosis\u2019 when the situation calls for it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWendigo psychosis? We\u2019re not Wendigos,\u201d Mary corrected him. \u201cWendigos are cursed with an insatiable hunger as a punishment for resorting to survival cannibalism, which seems a little judgmental if you ask me. The spirit cursing you couldn\u2019t be bothered to intervene when you were starving, but once you solve your own problem it suddenly gets off its high horse just to condemn you for it? Regardless, James and I are not Wendigos. We are Randian, Nietzschean \u00dcbermenschen. We recognize our intrinsic superiority and reject morality as a means for the weak to oppress the strong. We do as we damn well please, and we find living off the flesh of our victims incredibly pleasing. If no one can stop us, then why should we stop? Also, Wendigos have antlers.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, they don\u2019t,\u201d Crowley objected.\n\n\u201cAh, White Wendigos do. I\u2019m pretty sure those accounts take precedence,\u201d Mary said.\n\n\u201cRight. Well, random racism and self-serving philosophical butchery aside, I was referring to your propensity to strip down and wallow in your victim\u2019s viscera as you gorge yourself on their raw flesh,\u201d Crowley clarified. \u201cWhatever it is you call that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI call it a good time,\u201d Mary said, raising her glass in a toast before taking another tip.\n\n\u201cYou will refrain from resorting to any such debauchery tonight,\u201d Crowley insisted. \u201cTonight, you\u2019re here to work. Is that understood?\u201d\n\n\u201cWork? Me? Absolutely out of the question. James promised me I\u2019d never have to work a day in my life. Isn\u2019t that right, James Darling?\u201d\n\n\u201cTechnically, I forbid you from working. But, you being you, took that as a very loving gesture,\u201d James corrected her.\n\n\u201cHmmm. If you say so, James Darling. It\u2019s a moot point, regardless. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s more ridiculous; that a pretty girl like me would ever need to work or that a drunk like me could ever hold a job.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re being a bit hard on yourself, Mary Darling. You\u2019ve always managed to be a spectacular homemaker in spite of, perhaps even because of, your drunkenness,\u201d James complimented her.\n\n\u201cNow don\u2019t go getting all women\u2019s lib on me, James Darling. If being a homemaker was a job, then the invisible hand of the free market would give it a salary,\u201d she disputed. \u201cAs rational, Randian \u00dcbermenschen, we do not question the existence or wisdom of invisible hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve got me there, Mary Darling,\u201d James conceded.\n\n\u201cBut if you\u2019re not here to work, then why \u2013 I mean, if you don\u2019t mind my asking \u2013 why come at all?\u201d Crowley demanded.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t find a sitter, and we thought this would make a nice family outing,\u201d Mary replied.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 what?\u201d Crowley asked.\n\nIt was then that I saw James smile with his eyes in the worst way possible.\n\n\u201cSara\u2019s here,\u201d he explained, waving up at the tiered seats. \u201cHello, Sara Darling!\u201d\n\n\u201cHello, Daddy Darling! Hello, Mommy Darling!\u201d the cheery voice of a preteen girl called out from somewhere outside my field of vision. I heard the audience react in dismay at the revelation of her presence, which was very confusing as I couldn\u2019t fathom how a young girl\u2019s presence could have gone unnoticed in such a setting, or why it would be a cause of such trepidation.\n\n\u201cYou brought your forsaken child into my operating theatre!\u201d Crowley demanded, a violent outrage somehow surging through his mechanical voice.\n\n\u201cForsaken? How dare you! We may not be helicopter parents who oversee our daughter\u2019s every waking moment, but we gave her everything she needed to grow into the truly magnificent abomination she\u2019s become,\u201d Mary said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true we don\u2019t often take her out hunting with us, as she often prefers much more elaborate means of tormenting her prey than we do, but this isn\u2019t a hunt,\u201d James added. \u201cThis sort of thing is much more her style, and we thought it would be a genuinely educational experience for her.\u201d\n\n\u201cEducating bright young minds full of potential and advancing intellectual progress is always a valid reason for vivisecting a low-utility plodder like this,\u201d the girl asserted.\n\n\u201cYou see how conscientious she is? Always thinking about the ethics of things,\u201d Mary dotted. \u201cI honestly have no idea where she gets it from, but if she says it\u2019s morally obligatory for superior beings like us to do as we please in order to maximize overall happiness, I\u2019m not going to argue with her.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs everything all right, Crowley? You\u2019re looking more wrinkly and pickled than usual,\u201d James said with a menacing grin that stretched out his mask. \u201cOur Darling daughter is welcomed here, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise I won\u2019t be any trouble, Mr. Crowley,\u201d the girl said sweetly. \u201cI\u2019ll be as quiet as a church mouse who\u2019s terrified of what the priest will do to him if he tells his secret.\u201d\n\nThe brain pivoted in his jar, turning back and forth between the Darling Twins and their unseen child in the audience as if he could somehow see despite his lack of eyes.\n\n\u201cYes. Of course, she\u2019s welcome here. My apologies. I\u2019m just not accustomed to having children around, but of course, your daughter is the exception,\u201d Crowley muttered a forced and flustered apology.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s more than exceptional, Crowley. She\u2019s a Darling,\u201d James boasted proudly. \u201cWhen you\u2019re as perfect as we are, inbreeding only makes the bloodline stronger.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll defer to your considerable expertise on the matter of incest. However, I feel we\u2019ve kept our spectators waiting long enough,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, we can begin the procedure.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, Ducky. You might have to bear with me a bit though. Usually, when James and I play doctor, I\u2019m the patient, not the nurse,\u201d Mary explained. \u201cI get drugged up, stripped down, and felt up. Always a good time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how Daddy and I play doctor,\u201d Sara chirped out.\n\n\u201cOh, Sara Darling. That\u2019s because Daddy loves you and knows that if I ever saw you as a sexual threat, I\u2019d kill you,\u201d Mary replied, casually taking another sip from her martini.\n\nFor a moment there was dead silence, not a single person daring to risk interceding in this bizarre and disgusting threat between mother and child.\n\n\u201c\u2026You mean you\u2019d *try* to kill me,\u201d Sara said at last, her tone flat and cold, the juvenile joy and innocence I\u2019d heard before now utterly absent.\n\nI may have spotted a transitory glint of fear in Mary\u2019s eyes before she burst out laughing.\n\n\u201cAtta girl, Sara Darling. Sometimes I forget how much we\u2019re alike,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean that. Mommy\u2019s just a jealous old drunk. So long as you don\u2019t get any older, you can be Mommy\u2019s little monster forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mommy Darling. I won\u2019t,\u201d the girl promised. \u201cPuberty doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019d be any fun anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you don\u2019t have a brother to play with,\u201d Mary chortled. \u201cWhich I suppose I should get back to. James Darling, what should I do first?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell Mary Darling, even though you\u2019re not playing the patient today, I would never dare deprive you of your beloved drugs, and I think it would best if I gave them to you now before I get too occupied with the surgery,\u201d James said.\n\n\u201cGoodfellas?\u201d she asked hopefully.\n\nJames nodded, and Mary eagerly outstretched her hand and allowed him to tap a few pills into her palm. She raised the pills to her mouth, but paused before swallowing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not just giving me these so that I\u2019ll be out of your way during the surgery, are you James Darling?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cNo of course not \u2018just\u2019. I\u2019m still going to have my way with you later,\u201d he promised.\n\n\u201cOkay, good. I was worried there for a second,\u201d she sighed in relief before chasing down her pills with what was left of her martini. \u201cMmmm. Everyone out there in the audience, a moment if I may! I may not be a real nurse, but I have a lot of first-hand experience with prescription drugs. As any reputable pharmaceutical representative will tell you, an addiction to prescription medication is a crucial component of a happy and fulfilling life. I can personally attest that amphetamines and benzos have justly earned their reputation as Mommy\u2019s little helpers. I take Adderall when I need the mood and energy for housework, exercise, and lovemaking, Valium to help me unwind and to keep the shakes from waking me up through the night, and of course opioids whenever the booze isn\u2019t quite enough to keep me in my happy place. Oh, and don\u2019t pay any attention to the silly little warnings on the labels telling you not to mix them with alcohol. They pair together marvellously, though I do think I ought to sit down before this hits me any harder. James Darling, I\u2019ll just be over here if you need me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just relax, Mary Darling. I\u2019ve got this,\u201d James nodded as Mary stumbled off out of my sight, the sound of her collapsing and failing to land in a wooden chair following soon after.\n\nJames reached for an electric bone saw from the surgical table, and held it up high to the light to examine it. Then, turning his head down to look at me, he addressed me directly for the first time.\n\n\u201cHey there, buddy. How are you feeling?\u201d he asked. \u201cListen, don\u2019t feel bad about ending up on the slab here. Smarter people than you have fallen for my ploys, and I wasn\u2019t even lying about the whiskey. I realize it\u2019s customary to have some kind of painkiller during a procedure such as this, but as you just saw, the Missus cleaned me out. Happy wife, happy life, right? You understand, don\u2019t you? Besides, my little girl\u2019s up there, and nothing makes her happier than human suffering. You wouldn\u2019t want to let her down, would you? The good news is that you\u2019ve got plenty of paralytic pumping through your veins, and a complete lack of movement on your part is essential to reducing the risk of collateral damage. As much as this is going to hurt, you wouldn\u2019t want me to slip, would you?\u201d\n\nThe rotary blade began spinning, singing its distinctive whirring hum. Placing his left hand on my chest and savouring the futility of my rapid pulse, James brought his saw down upon my forehead. I felt the ragged blade tear up my flesh and mutilate my nerve endings, every rotation of the blade feeling like a fresh cut. The only thing worse than the agony was the fear, the overwhelming compulsion to escape, to fight back, to do anything, all to no avail. I was completely helpless as I stared up with fully dilated pupils at my attacker, his mask unable to conceal the demented Joker\u2019s smile underneath as he delighted in his mayhem.\n\nMy blood splattered up into his face, but this seemed only to delight him more. I could smell my flesh and bone searing from the friction of the saw, and my skull shook rapidly against its restraints from the continuous vibration. Throughout the ordeal, I was only able to hear two things over the sound of the saw against my skull; Crowley\u2019s dry lecturing to his students, and Sara\u2019s delighted laughter at her father\u2019s atrocity.\n\nWhen James had finally managed to cut through the entire circumference of my cranium, he turned the saw off and set it down on the tray beside him.\n\n\u201cThere we are Crowley; not one bit of grey matter nicked,\u201d he said proudly as he slowly lifted off the top half of my skull to reveal my exposed brain. \u201cAnd he\u2019s still conscious! I guess he didn\u2019t lose as much blood as it looks like.\u201d\n\n\u201cA successful craniectomy, and he was awake for every instant of it!\u201d Sara exclaimed. \u201cI could hear him screaming in my head the whole time. I\u2019ve never felt terror that was so urgent and helpless at the same time. Thank you so much for letting me come tonight, Daddy Darling!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Sara Darling! But we\u2019re not done yet, are we Crowley?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot remotely, no. Since the craniectomy went smoothly, it\u2019s time to move on to the next phase of the procedure,\u201d Crowley replied. \u201cJames, please insert the thaumic-electrodes in accordance with the diagram provided. Everyone, please take note that these electrodes are comprised of one hundred percent pure Seelie Silver, so their thaumaturgical conductivity is quite high. As you should all be aware, the Panpsychic force is the only direct link between the astral and physical planes, with consciousness being the only thing that exists across both realms. All preternatural phenomena are the result of focused and coherent Panpsychic force on either physical or astral reality. Now that James has all the electrodes implanted, you can see on the readout here that this brain\u2019s thaumatological activity is nearly a flatline. Which is good, as I don\u2019t much care for sharing my contraption here. Fortunately, these electrodes work both ways, and can channel psionic waves into as well as out of the brain. Please watch the readout carefully as James initiates electro-thaumic stimulation to the test subject.\u201d\n\nI hadn\u2019t felt James insert the electrodes into my brain, since the brain doesn\u2019t possess any pain receptors, but when I saw him flick a switch on whatever machine was behind me, I was suddenly aware of thirteen cold, metallic needles piercing deep into my brain tissue. It wasn\u2019t pain, so much as they were announcing their presence and I understood what it meant. They had a quick, rhythmic pulse to them, but the pulse wasn\u2019t in the physical matter of my brain but rather directly in my conscious mind. This was accompanied by a sensation I can only compare to static electricity accumulating inside my head.\n\n\u201cAs anticipated, the subject is reacting to the electro-thaumic stimulation,\u201d Crowley announced. \u201cWhile a first-hand account of his experience would no doubt be illuminating, I\u2019m highly skeptical he\u2019d be cooperative if we reduced his paralytics. Nonetheless, we can still infer a great deal from what \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cCan the machine go any higher?\u201d Sara asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2026 it can,\u201d Crowley replied hesitantly. \u201cBut that\u2019s not relevant for tonight\u2019s experiment. As I was saying, if we direct our attention back to the graph \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cDaddy Darling, turn the machine as high as it will go,\u201d Sara requested. \u201cI want to see what it will do to him!\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely out of the question!\u201d Crowley objected. \u201cThat would jeopardize the entire \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t asking you! I was asking Daddy!\u201d Sara cut him off again. \u201cTurn the machine as high as it will go!\u201d\n\nCrowley spun around in his jar to face James, who once again had a smile that no surgical mask could ever hide.\n\n\u201cJames, if you turn that dial so much as one notch higher, you will be in breach of our agreement and will have forfeited the second half of your payment!\u201d he warned him.\n\n\u201cHmm\u2026 Mary Darling, are you following this?\u201d he asked, turning towards where Mary collapsed some time ago. I heard her give an incoherent but affirmative-sounding response. \u201cCrowley says he\u2019s not going to pay up if I do as Sara Darling asks. Does this fall under my authority as a financial matter, or under yours as a family one?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 I suppose I did nearly ruin our family outing with my unprovoked death threat, so we should probably do something nice to make it up to her,\u201d she replied. \u201cIf you don\u2019t think the money\u2019s worth fretting over, go right ahead.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was never here for the money anyway,\u201d James shrugged. \u201cAnd what kind of monster would I be if I cared more about a little bit of money than my daughter\u2019s happiness?\u201d\n\n\u201cJames, don\u2019t you dare \u2013 \u201d\n\nBefore Crowley could even finish his sentence, James spun the dial as far as it would go.\n\nThe static electricity I had felt inside my head exploded into a thunderstorm, and I felt my bones break as I spasmed uncontrollably against my restraints. Bolts and waves of the strange sensation effortlessly escaped my body and began ravaging the environment around me. Some part of me that managed to remain lucid amongst the alien agony tried to direct these forces against my captors, but I found I was utterly unable to control it in any meaningful way.\n\nThe audience had broken out into panicked screams as they desperately tried to flee the operating theatre, except of course for Sara, who I heard laughing and applauding gleefully.\n\nCrowley fired an electric arc from his tesla coil at James as he wheeled himself towards the machine behind me, but Mary had evidently been roused from her drugged stupor and attacked him from behind, stabbing a butcher\u2019s knife through his bellows over and over until he lost all momentum and screeched to a stop. The bubbles in his jar all fell still, and he had seemingly lost the ability to speak through his horn as well, but the brain itself remained glowing and active, slamming itself against the glass in impotent rage.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think will give out first, Mary Darling? The man or the machine?\u201d James asked, acrid smoke from the overloaded machine stinging my eyes as the violent spasms threatened to tear my body apart. Before Mary could answer, the machine sparked and sputtered out, its ungodly racket dying down to a raspy whimper as the psionic assault on my mind finally came to an end.\n\n\u201cYay!\u201d Sara cheered and applauded before running down to join her parents. She was still behind me and I couldn\u2019t see her, but I heard her throw herself into her father\u2019s arms. \u201cThank you, Daddy Darling! That was so much more fun than just keeping it on one. He\u2019s never felt pain like that before, and he still didn\u2019t die! It was marvellous!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Sara Darling,\u201d James cooed. \u201cThough, our subject\u2019s surprising resilience does present us with a bit of a dilemma, doesn\u2019t it? Mary Darling, do you think we should finish him off?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no fun in killing someone who can\u2019t put up a fight. He\u2019ll probably be pretty onery once the paralytics wear off, but I don\u2019t really want to wait around for that, especially not with Crowley\u2019s associates likely on their way,\u201d Mary replied. \u201cPlus, that adrenaline surge I just got is already fading and the fentanyl is kicking right back in. We ought to head home. What do you say, Sara Darling? Have you had enough fun for tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have. Thank you for taking me with you, Mommy Darling,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cAnd I forgive you for threatening to kill me. I know it was only because you love Daddy so much. And thank you, Mr. Crowley. I\u2019m sorry about the damage to your theatre, but it made me very happy and I learned a lot, so it was worth it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition to the other half of my payment, you can keep the test subject as well,\u201d James offered. \u201cThat should set as even, Crowley, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nCrowley responded by angrily bashing himself into the glass of his jar.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a pity then. Let\u2019s head out then, girls, before crotchety old Crowley gets the wind back in his bellows,\u201d James said.\n\n\u201cJust a minute, Daddy Darling,\u201d Sara said, and I felt someone pulling out the electrodes from my brain and then setting my severed cranium back in place. \u201cThank you too, mister. I really did enjoy watching you suffer like that, and because you made me so happy, I\u2019m going to let you walk away from this.\u201d\n\nLooking up, I could see her bending down to kiss my forehead. She had a flawless porcelain face framed by long dark locks; a perfect, *darling* daughter that any parent would be proud of, except for her eyes. From any casual viewing distance, they could pass for being very dark brown, but when she was face to face with me, I could tell that her irises were actually filled with some sort of animate black fluid, swirling like hurricanes of obsidian storm clouds.\n\nWhen she kissed me, every broken bone and my body snapped back into place and began slowly, excruciatingly knitting themselves back together. If I could have screamed, I would have cursed the demonic little girl out for her perverse sense of mercy.\n\nPulling back, she gave me a smug smile, undoubtedly aware of how much pain she was causing me and exactly what I thought of her.\n\n\u201cYou're going to want to get out of here as soon as you can stand, before Crowley's cronies show up,\u201d she said as she undid my restraints one by one.  \"Feel better, mister!\"\n\nSinging happily, she turned around and skipped off with her parents, the sound of their footsteps slowly receding until eventually fading altogether, leaving me and Crowley lying humiliated and defeated in the now silent and [forsaken](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/) [operating](https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/) [theatre](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/).",

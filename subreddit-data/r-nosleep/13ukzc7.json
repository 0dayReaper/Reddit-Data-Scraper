    "postText": "It all started Friday, when we (myself and my roommate James) went fishing at one of the local lakes. Or, at least we tried to go fishing. It's Spring but the lake we drove to was still frozen. Ice fishing wasn\u2019t something we\u2019d ever done, but we figured it couldn't be too difficult. When we arrived I tentatively tested the ice and it seemed solid, so we ventured further out. The ice cracked underfoot in a few places, but neither of us were very concerned. Once we got to a nice spot in the middle I sat down on one of the buckets we\u2019d brought and started fitting our poles with hooks. While I was doing that, James set about trying to make a hole in the ice. He started by stomping on it with his foot to no effect. Then, he grabbed his bucket and began hammering away at it.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNeed some help over there?\u201d I said in a somewhat teasing tone.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNo I\u2019ve got it, I just need a better spot, this one\u2019s much too hard.\u201d he said, jumping on the spot as proof.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhoa don\u2019t do that! If the ice breaks you\u2019ll fall in and I\u2019d have to save you, then as payment you\u2019d have to treat me to a beer at Shelby\u2019s.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMan you know I don\u2019t like that place, it's so dingy. But as I said, the ice won\u2019t break. I\u2019m going to look for another spot.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAlright, well I\u2019m done with the poles. Let me know if you need any help then.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAwesome, you can see the fish swimming under the ice over here. This is the spot, I know it!\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cGreat! I\u2019ll move our gear over.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nSuddenly, I heard a loud crack and a small splash. I looked over and saw James had his foot stuck in the ice.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHey you alright? Don\u2019t move, let me come pull you out.\u201d I said, dropping our poles and walking over. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cNo I don\u2019t need any help, I just need to pull my leg out. This water is cold as hell!\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cYeah I bet. I\u2019m coming over anyway just in case.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNah I got it, see?\u201d he said, before aggressively trying to pull his foot out of the hole. Almost immediately he lost his balance, and fell forward slamming into the dark patch of ice. I heard the surface give way and saw him fall into the water. I ran over to the hole and tried to see him, but the water was too muddy. Frantically, I plunged my arms into the water and grabbed randomly hoping to find a purchase on James. My arms started burning, and after a few minutes I had to pull them out. I started panicking and didn\u2019t know if I should jump in after him. I decided I would call 911 first, even though I knew there\u2019s nothing they could do, and then would jump in after him. But just as I dialed the number I saw a hand come out of the water. I dropped my phone and grabbed it, heaving a muddy body onto the ice and pulling it towards more solid ground. It was James, he was covered in mud and some grass, but other than that seemed perfectly fine. He wasn\u2019t even shivering, nor did he seem particularly stressed. Once I\u2019d helped him to his feet he stood and turned towards the hole in the ice, looking at it pensively.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAre you alright James?\u201d I asked. He didn\u2019t respond, so I grabbed his arm and pulled him away from the hole towards the shore. I\u2019d suddenly remembered that not shivering was a symptom of severe hypothermia, something that would only get worse in those wet clothes of his. I almost had to drag him away, but he offered no resistance, just kept looking behind him at the hole. When we reached the car I turned the heater to maximum, and undressed James. I gave him my jacket and wrapped him in a blanket I had in the back.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cJames? Can you hear me? I\u2019m taking you to a clinic now, there\u2019s one only 15 minutes away.\u201d I started the GPS and pulled out of the small recreation area, but before I could get onto the road James grabbed me and started screaming.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cTAKE ME BACK TAKE ME BACK TAKE ME BACK TAKE ME BACK\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI jumped and hit my head on the roof of the car.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDammit James you scared the crap out of me, are you all right?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nHe let go of me, and whispered \u201cTake me back.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNo, we\u2019re going to a clinic. You're clearly hypothermic, you're not even shivering but you\u2019re ice cold. End of discussion.\u201d I said, and then continued onto the road towards the clinic. I focused on the road, but I could feel his eyes on me. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe\u2019ll come back another day.\u201d I said. I quickly glanced to my left, and was startled to see he was looking directly into my eyes.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAlright,\u201d he whispered, before slowly looking away and out the window. \r  \n\r  \nWe spent the rest of the drive in silence, until we reached the hospital. The doctor said he didn\u2019t have hypothermia, but gave him some dry clothes and recommended standing by the heater until he warmed up. James nodded, but headed straight for the car. I quickly said thanks to the doctor, and followed James. It would take an hour to get to our apartment, so I flipped through my CD collection.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 I\u2019ve got the Cars, and we\u2019re in a car so it seems like a worthy choice.\u201d I smiled at him, it was a joke I\u2019d told many times before that usually got an eye roll, and occasionally a laugh. But this time James didn\u2019t give me either, and instead continued looking out the window. \u201cAlright\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s try something you like.\u201d I pulled an Elton John CD out of its sleeve and popped it in the stereo. Elton John is his favorite, and he can\u2019t help but sing along to Rocketman. This was the first time he hadn\u2019t. He even sang to it when I picked him up after his girlfriend dumped him in college.\r  \n\r  \nWhen we finally arrived at our apartment I pulled into the parking space at the back of our building. James didn\u2019t say a word and silently followed me to our door. Once inside, he went over to the couch, lied down, and closed his eyes. I thought he was probably shaken by his experience and needed some time alone, so I let him be and went to my room. I was a bit worried about him so I spent the day at home Saturday, but he still wouldn\u2019t make conversation with me. Then in the evening, he came out of his room and sat down next to me.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cTake me back, \" he whispered.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cTake you back where exactly?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cTo the lake, you said you\u2019d take me back.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOh yeah I guess I said that. Honestly, I don\u2019t really trust the ice after what happened, we should wait a month or so until it fully melts and then just fish like we normally do.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cBut you promised. You said we\u2019d go back another day.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYes, when the ice melts. Maybe it\u2019ll just take a few more weeks.\u201d I said, perplexed at his insistence.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI need to go back.\u201d he said, eyes suddenly locking with mine.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to go back, you want to go back alright? We are not going back so soon, I\u2019d be stressed out the whole time. You could\u2019ve died, you know.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSo you won\u2019t take me back?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThat is correct, the lake is much too dangerous and you\u2019ve been super quiet ever since we got back. I\u2019m going out with Dale tonight, but when I get back we should talk about what happened and try and work through it alright? I\u2019ll be back late, but text me if you need anything. Also, don\u2019t forget it's your turn to make dinner.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThen I left, and went to meet up with my friend Dale. We had more than a few drinks, and talked about a recent hunting trip he\u2019d been on with his son. Dale has a way of continuing conversations way longer than you\u2019d think possible, but because I don\u2019t see him as much as I used to I let him talk all he wants. Needless to say, I got in pretty late and was very hungry. I didn\u2019t see anything on the counter, so I figured James had wrapped dinner up in the fridge. Standard procedure when I\u2019m out with Dale, who never fails to keep me out all night. But, when I looked in the fridge there was nothing there. \r  \n\r  \nJames loved to cook and never missed an opportunity to try out a new recipe on me. I saw his door was open, so I popped my head into his room to see if he was still up. I was surprised to see that he wasn't there, so I decided to see where he was using Find My Friends. When I saw that he was in the middle of a random forest I was confused, until I realized he was heading to the lake on foot. I was very concerned and immediately raced to my car. Admittedly, I had had a few drinks, but I\u2019m a big guy and it was an emergency so I drove out anyway. There wasn\u2019t anyone on the road this late regardless, and all I could think about was James falling through the ice again.\r  \n\r  \nIt was very dark when I arrived at the lake. It was still frozen, just as before, but I could make out a figure in the center illuminated by the moonlight. I quickly hurried to the edge and cautiously stepped closer to the figure, ice sometimes cracking underfoot. As I walked I could see a few holes in the ice, presumably caused by animals falling under. I heard splashing water to my left and saw a muddy deer somehow manage to stumble out of the water. It was dragging a dark mass alongside it, and quickly moved into the darkness of the forest out of sight. I heard a yelp as something fell through the water to my right just as I approached James.\r  \n\r  \nHe stood with his back toward me, staring into a large hole in the ice. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cJames, I saw a lot of holes in the ice on my way over to you. I really don't think this is safe. Let\u2019s go home. I\u2019m worried you might not be thinking clearly, you\u2019re putting us both in danger right now. We really shouldn't be on the ice.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cLook,\u201d he said, without turning.\r  \n\r  \nI walked up beside him, and looked into the hole. The water was crystal clear, and I could see a naked body tangled in the weeds. Suddenly, James stepped forward and jumped into the hole. Stunned, I watched him move towards the body before the mud obscured my vision. After a few seconds his hand came out of the water reaching towards me. I grabbed it, and with some effort pulled him and the body out onto the ice, hearing a subtle crack as their collective weight bore down on the lake's surface. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cJames? What is happening right now?\u201d I said. \r  \n\r  \nHe didn\u2019t answer, just stood up and looked at the body with a curious look on his face. He started to wipe the mud off the body with his sleeve, and I realized the corpse had James\u2019 face. They were identical, except for the fact that the body was naked and James was clothed. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat the fuck? Who is this? Why did you know there was a body here? Why does he look like you?\u201d I said nervously. \r  \n\r  \nIn lieu of an answer, James turned to look at me with a confused expression. I backed away slowly and clutched my phone in my pocket ready to call 911, when, suddenly, a muddy deer emerged from the forest and began to approach James. As it got closer I saw it had a bloodied deer leg in its mouth. It moved quickly, and was next to James within seconds. The deer dropped the leg, walked over to the body, and began to lightly chew the dead doppelganger's arm. It looked at James, then back at the body and walked back to where it had dropped the deer leg. Then, it put it back in its mouth and began to chew, before looking back at James again. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cOh, thanks.\u201d James said.\r  \n\r  \nThe deer bowed its head slightly, then returned to the forest.\r  \n\r  \nSuddenly, James dropped to his knees and lifted up an arm of the body. He immediately began tearing into the flesh, savagely ripping off pieces with his muddy hands and teeth. I felt vomit come up my throat, and I blacked out. \r  \n\r  \nNext thing I knew I was in bed. I felt cold, dirty, and tired. When I left my room James was making breakfast as if nothing had happened. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cGood morning,\u201d I said warily.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cGood morning! How\u2019d you sleep?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI didn\u2019t respond, I could still see the body being torn apart on the ice, but the memories were hazy. I wasn\u2019t drunk at the time but I had been drinking prior, and somehow I was back in the apartment like I\u2019d never left. It all seemed a bit surreal, but I have never had a dream so disturbing before. I looked out the window and saw that my car was still in its spot, but I was also still wearing my clothes from the bar, which initially seemed a tad odd.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d James said, with a concerned look on his face. \u201cYou know you took quite a nasty fall last night. You really shouldn\u2019t drink so much.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI fell? When?\u201d I said, touching my head and confirming that it was a bit sore.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou came home last night after you went drinking with Dale and I guess you slipped on the doormat or something, I heard a thud and found you passed out cold on the floor.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHuh, you\u2019re right I guess I did drink a bit too much\u201d I lied. \u201cBut you know Dale, he\u2019s just got a way of keeping you on that stool.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cClearly! Just know you can call me to pick you up anytime, you don\u2019t have to stumble home all by yourself.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThanks, anyway I\u2019ve got to get going. See you later?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNot hungry? I\u2019ve got some eggs here, they\u2019re crunchy, just the way you like them!\u201d\r  \n\r  \nBy \u2018crunchy\u2019 James meant he had put the entirety of the egg into the bowl and whisked it all together; this was his signature. He lived with his grandfather for a bit as a kid, and apparently the madman refused to separate the shells, claiming they were a great source of calcium. James was always trying to get me to try them, but I always declined.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d I said, unable to suppress a small smile. \u201cI\u2019ve got some errands to run, I\u2019ll see you in a bit.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAlright your loss, see you later! Don\u2019t forget it's your turn to make dinner.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOf course.\u201d I said, walking out the door and grabbing my keys from the bowl. \r  \n\r  \nWhen I got to my car I started heading towards the supermarket, but stopped beside the road once I was out of sight of the building. My seat felt slightly damp and the interior had a bit of an earthy smell, so I opened the window. I hoped that I had dreamt the whole thing, but every time I thought about what I\u2019d seen I felt nauseous again. I had to be sure, so I decided to go back to the lake. I was paranoid that James might use Find My Friends on me, so I actually did end up going to the supermarket and hid my phone nearby, and just hoped if he did check it he would only look once. Then I booted up my GPS and headed back to the lake.\r  \n\r  \nAs usual, when I arrived the small parking lot was empty. I quickly headed to the lake and very carefully walked towards the center. As I walked my memories of the night prior kept flashing before me, the muddy deer dragging something across the ice, the crunch of the ice beneath my feet. Eventually I reached the spot where James had fallen. The ice was clean, no body in sight. I didn\u2019t even see any blood. I very nervously looked down into the water, but again didn't see anything suspicious. Perhaps this should\u2019ve convinced me it was a dream, but I\u2019m much too stubborn for that, so I decided I would need to find a way to test James. I started heading back to the supermarket in my car to retrieve my phone, and thought up a plan. \r  \n\r  \nWhen I arrived at the store I grabbed my phone and bought some groceries. Then I went about actually completing my errands as if it were a regular Sunday, albeit much more slowly than I would normally. I managed to stretch out my chores until 4:00 PM, then headed home to start dinner. When I arrived James was on the couch watching television. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWow you were gone a long time.\u201d he said.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWell, I had quite a bit to do. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m ready to make you some dinner.\u201d I said cheerfully.\r  \n\r  \nI made spaghetti while he watched Netflix, and when it was done set the table. James\u2019 favorite drink is apple juice, he drinks it paired with almost any meal. So, as anticipated when I asked him what he wanted to drink he asked for it. I got us both opaque glasses, and poured him a cup filled with apple cider vinegar, myself with lemonade, then I called him over to the table.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cBon App\u00e9tit!\u201d I said dramatically, with a flourish of my hand.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m starving, thanks for making one of my favorites.\u201d he said.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWell, we both had a bit of a difficult weekend, so I\u2019m counting on you to make Shepherd's pie sometime next week.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDefinitely! You know, you're actually a really good Italian cook! If I didn\u2019t know better I\u2019d think there might be a little rat pulling the strings up there.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWell I was classically trained by the best YouTube chefs.\u201d I said, as I watched him down half the glass of vinegar without batting an eye.\r  \n\r  \nAfter dinner I went to my room and left James with the dishes. Then, I sat down on my computer and began organizing my thoughts. Now I\u2019m just waiting till he goes to sleep before I make my move. I\u2019m going to creep into his room tonight and kill him using an axe I snuck in when I brought up the groceries. I don\u2019t know what he is, but I do know James, my James, is dead. The only thing I can do now is kill the monster I saw eating him. I just hope the element of surprise will be enough, and I pray I'll be able to go through with it when the time comes. I just have to wait for him to turn out the lights, it'll be any moment now.",

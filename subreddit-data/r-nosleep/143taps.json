    "postText": "I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been hearing about how the US government is selling off parcels of land for incredibly cheap \u2013 you could get your very own lighthouse or abandoned department of wildlife building for a few thousand dollars.\n\nThey say it\u2019s so these buildings and sites can be maintained by private citizens rather than continue to spiral into disrepair.\n\nRecent experience has led me to the conclusion that the real reason is far more sinister.\n\nI knew it was going to need some work when I saw the pictures \u2013 peeling paint, doors taken off their hinges, the thin spiral staircase leading to the top was missing a step. But with a starting bid of $1,000? On the off chance that it worked out, it was worth it.\n\nI threw out a dollar over the minimum bid late at night and then went to bed with zero expectations \u2013 none-too-fondly recalling the old eBay days where someone would jump in and outbid you at the last minute, so I was genuinely shocked to wake up to an email that I\u2019d actually won.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for me to realize I was in way over my head. The excitement I\u2019d felt over owning a place of my own dissolved the moment I saw the tall grey structure looming above me on the horizon. The picture on the website had shown the quintessential red and white striped lighthouse with turquoise waters and the deep blue sky as a backdrop, this building was a stark grey pitted stone tower, sitting atop a windowless cement base. I checked the paperwork, this was the correct address \u2013 I tried the code on the lockbox, it worked. I emailed the contact information from the website, but I wasn\u2019t sure what else to do while I was waiting, other than check out the inside. As I walked the narrow and winding path to the door, I couldn\u2019t help but notice how the beach grass and flowers that dotted the rest of the landscape stopped abruptly at the beginning of the pathway; seabirds too, stayed far away.\n\nWalking in, I was overwhelmed by the amount of work I could tell that the place was going to need \u2013 it was even worse than the pictures had indicated. Paint had long peeled off, revealing large patches of discoloration on the walls and ceiling. Doors from the small rooms had been taken off their hinges and used to board up the entrance to the cement cylinder that served as the base.\n\nThere was a sort of heaviness I felt the moment I stepped over the threshold. At the time, I chalked it up to buyers' remorse from seeing the level of disrepair it had fallen into.\n\nI've since come to believe that when a place is exposed to centuries of death, loneliness, and madness \u2013 it becomes as much part of it as the floors, or walls, or roof.\n\nThe company replied, they seemed as confused as I was about the pictures and apologized for the mix up \u2013 it seemed like an innocent mistake.\n\nIt probably should\u2019ve deterred me, but I was still caught up in the high of owning my own land \u2013 picturing moving out of my apartment, not having a rent or mortgage.\n\nWell, I was right in a way, I certainly won\u2019t need to worry about rent again. Or a mortgage. Or anything else outside of this place, for that matter.\n\nI\u2019d reached out to several contractors, trying to line up repairs. Floors, walls, doors, stairs \u2013 you name it, there was something wrong with it.\n\nMost had straight up turned me down when they heard where the job would be \u2013 some politely but nervously declined, others just hung up on me. It took me weeks to finally find someone, from two towns over, that was willing to come out and even take a look.\n\nHe was a friendly guy that introduced himself as Joey and offhandedly mentioned he was surprised to see the place with another new owner so soon. Before I could ask any follow up questions to that, he was off measuring, and jotting down notes, and then disappeared up the stairs.\n\nAs the sun began to set, I realized it had been hours since I\u2019d last seen him. I saw his pickup, still sitting outside, and called around for him. I walked up to the very top, careful to avoid the missing step \u2013  taking in the briny air while searching the perimeter. I checked each of the small rooms with their peeling paint and stained floors, I went to the bottom \u2013 and then reluctantly to the only place I hadn\u2019t looked yet \u2013 the cement cylinder at the base. I\u2019d stuck my head down there the very first day after removing the barricades and immediately decided it was a place I\u2019d prefer to never visit again. It was made up of a series of narrow and dark concrete tunnels, stained with rust and filled with a dank mildewy smell. Without windows or power, it was pitch black there even during the brightest of days.\n\nI opened the door and called out for him, but my own voice echoing back at me was the only response. Reluctantly, I descended, shining my flashlight around the interior of the tunnels and trying to convince myself that I definitely could find my way back and probably wouldn\u2019t be trapped down there forever.\n\nAt the end of one of the passageways, I saw something that surprised me \u2013 a set of ancient looking stairs that led downwards. I was confused, because the cylinder was at the very bottom, anything below it would\u2019ve been solid rock, and eventually the ocean. I found my palms sweating so profusely at the thought of going down those stone steps that I nearly dropped my flashlight.\n\nI called his name weakly but heard nothing. It was unnervingly quiet \u2013 a sort of thick silence that was heavy on the air. I hesitated \u2013 part of me just longed to be in the lighted interior of my car, doors locked, on the way back to my crappy apartment. It would\u2019ve been easy enough to get lost down there, and the thought of otherwise abandoning someone else to the darkness encouraged me to fight through my own fears and continue onward.\n\nI took a deep breath and cautiously took the first step, the tunnels just a dark blur behind me. The stairs formed a spiral downwards and as I descended, it felt as if the pitted walls began to close in around me  as I continued down what seemed like an endless amount of stone steps. I knew I had to have been impossibly far down, at least ten stories below the ground level. I still saw no sign of Joey \u2013 my voice had long since stopped echoing, as the space around me had narrowed.\n\nEvery so often I\u2019d come across graffiti, drawings, tally marks scribbled or scratched into the walls. At the top of the stairs, someone had started in the middle of a long and rambling letter to a loved one that wrapped along the ever-narrowing walls in cramped handwriting. The further I continued downwards, the content devolved into nonsense \u2013 words were written on top of each other and strung together to form meaningless sentences, and then eventually stopped altogether. Different handwriting had picked up where it left off and had simply said \u2018they are waiting\u2019. Others seemed to have underlined and circled the phrase in agreement as they too walked by. After I passed an \u2018I\u2019m not ready yet\u2019 that looked to have been written in blood, I decided that I was done reading graffiti and that I\u2019d focus strictly on the stairs.\n\nThe darkness, the narrowing walls \u2013 the slick steps \u2013 I paused at one point and wondered why I was still going, but besides the guilt if I gave up, I felt compelled to, eager almost.\n\nJust as the space became so tight that the stone painfully scraped against my shoulders, the stairs sharply stopped at a small platform that opened into a tiny room \u2013 the first I\u2019d seen since I\u2019d been down here. The walls were covered with apologies, good-byes, confessions, love letters \u2013 some written, some carved into the stone.  Of those that were still legible, some were written in anguish, others with fear, some were just pure madness, but not one of them expressed hope.\n\nSomeone had written EXIT HERE in large, disjointed letters, with a crudely drawn arrow pointing downwards to a hatch on the floor.\n\nI hesitated for a moment \u2013 knowing there was nothing below us but rock and ocean \u2013 and I should\u2019ve hit those hours ago, but decided I\u2019d come all this way, I might as well keep going.\n\nIt led to even more stairs, but this time the steps were that of a tight iron spiral staircase, one step missing. I felt a sudden stale breeze as I descended. There were windows around me that opened into the pitch-black night \u2013 it was so dark outside that I hadn't even realized they were windows at all at first.\n\nI froze \u2013 confused \u2013 I wasn\u2019t sure how I managed to get myself so utterly turned around \u2013 I knew I\u2019d been walking downwards the entire way. I was certain of it. Yes, I was tired, it was dark, but I knew up from down.\n\nI heard a sound from below \u2013 a whirring, and thought I\u2019d finally found Joey \u2013 or somehow, some sort of exit. Something. Anything but more stairs. Relieved, I decided to continue downwards \u2013 upwards \u2013 the direction I\u2019d been going.\n\nAt the bottom, was a ladder leading to another hatch on the floor. I climbed down, opened it, and \u2013 to my utter confusion \u2013 found myself standing at the top of the lighthouse.\n\nI grasped for the railing to orient and brace myself against the strong, stinging wind. I couldn\u2019t see the moon, stars \u2013 any light reflecting on the water around me. It was somehow darker outside than it had been in the tunnels and unlight stairwell \u2013 darker than I had previously thought possible.\n\nThe choppy black waters of the sea were indistinguishable from the sky, the land, even with the steady flash of the strangely tinted automated light \u2013 the whirring I\u2019d heard \u2013 I could see very little. At first, I felt a wave of relief at seeing Joey\u2019s car was gone \u2013 he\u2019d made it out \u2013  but it was short lived when I realized that mine was gone too. The shore, the beach houses in the distance \u2013 everything was gone. The wind had picked up \u2013 instead of the light and briny sea air it was heavy in my lungs and had a smell \u2013 earthiness mixed with something else that I couldn\u2019t place at the time.\n\nAlthough I couldn\u2019t see much of anything beyond the railing when the light above flashed, I could just make out pale, nearly translucent forms being tossed along in the black water far in the distance.\n\nWhen I finally managed to look away from the hypnotizing motion of whatever was floating in the waves, I realized the slick floor was littered with items \u2013 Joey\u2019s shoes, notepad, and toolbelt. A woman\u2019s purse, leather peeling from the constant barrage of the black water \u2013 piles and piles of neatly folded clothes.\n\nI panicked, opened the hatch I\u2019d come down \u2013 up?\u2013 through.\n\nI was relieved to see steps leading down. I rushed back down the metal stairs, slipping from the dark water that had splashed against my shoes, before making it back to the platform.\n\nI ran as fast as my tired legs would allow, past the hundreds of additional \u2018They are waiting\u2019 messages I had missed the first time. It wasn\u2019t until I reached the top of the stone steps that I paused for the first time, and I took deep gulping breaths in relief \u2013 until I saw it.\n\nEXIT HERE, the arrow pointing upwards.\n\nI told myself I must have missed that on the way down. I laughed, even, chiding myself for my forgetfulness as I reached for the opening to the hatch, eager to return to the dank interior of the cement cylinder. I never would\u2019ve thought I\u2019d be happy to see that pitch black series of tunnels again.\n\nMy laughter turned to misery.\n\nI think I sobbed that first time, when the fetid breeze hit my face \u2013 bringing with it that smell of old things. Welcoming things. My phone said it was 6:45 AM, but it never got any lighter outside. The pale things in the sea below moved along with the waves, their tangled limbs just a bit clearer in the closer proximity.\n\nI opened the hatch and climbed back down, but slowly that time, wobbly with exhaustion. When I descended and reached the platform and little room again, EXIT HERE pointing downwards at the hatch \u2013 I didn\u2019t even bother opening it for the longest time. Eventually, I knew I needed to. Just in case. I needed to see.\n\nI started to lose track of how many times I made that fruitless journey that always ended the same way \u2013 with me stepping outside into the endless night. I didn\u2019t start my own tally marks right away, but it\u2019s been forty trips since I started counting.\n\nBy the 7th recorded time I had stepped out into the darkness, I was laughing. I needed to see the water. I had to breathe in that air \u2013 it was an urge that I could not fight. The pale forms in the dark waters moved with the current \u2013 closer, further away, closer, further. Closer. Closer. Closer still.\n\nI've been trying to conserve my phone battery ever since I've found I have a faint signal in the exact middle of the stairs. I've been so tempted to call for help \u2013 an overwhelming urge that is still hard to fight, even though I know I'd be dooming them as well.\n\nAccording to the date, I've been stuck here for a week with no food or water. At one point I tripped and smashed my head on the stone steps \u2013 based on the sound and the blood, an injury that should have been fatal. Even death refuses to grant me reprieve.\n\nI\u2019ve memorized every \u2018They are waiting\u2019 written along the walls, every word of each confession.\n\nI\u2019ve even written a few messages of my own.\n\nOne is on the wall with the others, short, streaky, and written in the only medium I could find, for whomever is unfortunate to follow in my footsteps \u2013 and this post. A warning to others that may also be tempted to accept a deal that seems too good to be true.\n\nAlthough much of it is illegible, I do think the graffiti was right about two things.\n\nThat out into the stale air, into the embrace of the dark sea \u2013 that is truly the exit, the only way out.\n\nAnd, judging by the slap of wet footsteps on the hatch above my head, they are [waiting for me](https://www.reddit.com/user/JamFranz/comments/11or7ez/hello_and_welcome/).",

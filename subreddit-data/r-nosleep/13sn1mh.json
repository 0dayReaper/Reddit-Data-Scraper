    "postText": "Have you ever been to a haunted house?\n\nOne of those haunted houses that open in your town around the first of October. Some places use their old jail or defunct courthouse to create a local tourist attraction. Sometimes it\u2019s a charity that uses the funds to supplement its budget.\n\nYou know the type. It\u2019s filled with fake cotton spiderwebs, men in cheap masks, dim lighting, and the terrible loop of screams atop the cheap mood music. The lights will randomly turn off only to turn back on and reveal one of your favorite movie slashers standing only feet away.\n\nThose are the ones.\n\nMy friends and I used to go to them every year since middle school, but I\u2019ll never go again.\n\nSome of them are real. Some of them you never walk away from.\n\nDuring my senior year of high school, my group of friends decided that the local haunted houses were kind of played out for us. We wanted something fresh. Something that would scare us. Nothing we could find within a thirty-mile drive had done the trick.\n\nThen Jimmy told us about Stanford Sanatorium. That\u2019s right, a sanatorium. Not a sanitarium. This place had been used as a tuberculosis hospital back in the early nineteen hundreds. An outbreak of tuberculosis called \u201cThe White Plague\u201d hit the area so they built a huge hospital to handle all of the chronic cases.\n\nSometime in the sixties, a new medication was created to treat TB that made sanitoriums obsolete. The building stood empty for a few decades after that. Sometime in the eighties, a business investor purchased the property and intended to convert it into a hotel, but plans fell through for some reason or another.\n\nThe sanatorium continued to fall into disrepair and eventually, the city took ownership. They converted it into a museum dedicated to the history of \u201cThe White Plague\u201d and medical history from that period. It helped pay for the upkeep, but the budget was still razor-thin.\n\nThat\u2019s when the city commissioner decided to offer \u201chaunted\u201d tours of the building. They proved to be a decent hit and eventually evolved into a nearly month-long haunted hospital tour during the Halloween season. It was only two hours away from us and it seemed perfect.\n\nWhat could be scarier than a building where hundreds of people died, right?\n\nOur parents were hesitant at first, but we wore them down. We would leave town early, take the tour before it was even dark, and then head home immediately. No big deal.\n\nWhen we arrived, the building was staggering. Three stories of red brick. The front was covered in long walkways and hundreds of doors were visible. Each room was completely separated and opened up to the outdoors to provide better ventilation than architecture at the time would allow.\n\nThe structure seemed sturdy, but heavy cracks and thick vines ran up the sides of the building. All of the paint flaked and peeled from the doors. Some of the windows on the top floor were broken and left uncovered.\n\nThere were almost no cars in the parking lot. The sun still sat high in the sky. Who wanted to take a haunted hospital tour in the daylight?\n\nI still wish we had never gone in.\n\nJimmy, Carlos, Stephen, and I jumped out of the car and followed the signs to the admission table. A woman wearing an old-fashioned nursing outfit sat at the desk and took five dollars from each of us and then slid a clipboard in front of us.\n\nIt was a liability release. We laughed and told her we were minors and were too young to sign. She smiled.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need you to sign it anyway,\u201d she said in a whispering tone. \u201cYou never know what could happen!\u201d\n\nWe all laughed and signed the sheets of paper and handed them to her. At the time, we thought it was supposed to set the tone, but now I know she was serious. I wish we had never gone inside.\n\nOur half-hour inside was kind of a bust. The tour was self-guided and you could go anywhere in any order you wanted. We opted to check out the patient rooms first, assuming there would be horrifying scenes, but we were quickly let down.\n\nThe rooms sat in ruins. A rusted bed frame with a shredded mattress. Bedpans, molding sheets, and splintering chairs scattered the floor. The only thing in those rooms worth signing a release for would have been the risk of tetanus.\n\n\u201cMan, this kind of blows,\u201d Carlos said as we walked down the open-air corridor. \u201cWant to head home? This seems like it wasn\u2019t worth the trip.\u201d\n\nStephen pulled a brochure for the place out of his back pocket. Unfolding it, he thumped the map with his middle finger excitedly. We all looked down.\n\n\u201cThe rooms are only part of the tour,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cIn the basement, there is still an operating theater and morgue. We\u2019ve gotta check that out before we go.\u201d\n\nWe all shrugged and followed Stephen as he guided us toward the stairwell leading into the basement. I\u2019m not sure how many flights we walked down, but it seemed like it took ages. What the rooms lacked in disturbing scenery, the way to the basement made up for it quickly.\n\nOnce we entered the basement, the smell of must and decay filled our noses. The sounds of dripping water echoed through the empty halls. We walked cautiously in the low light, expecting a jump scare or two, but one never came.\n\nSomehow, the lack of intended horror made it worse.\n\nOur footsteps echoed off the grime-covered tile walls and occasionally we would splash through a shallow puddle. None of us spoke. The ambiance of the subterranean levels had crept into our bones.\n\nAs we continued walking, we could see a brighter light ahead.\n\n\u201cLooks like we\u2019re almost to the operating theatre,\u201d Jimmy said as he looked at his pamphlet. \u201cAccording to this, we can watch a\u2026 surgery in progress. Let\u2019s check it out.\u201d\n\nWe reached a wall of dirty windows and saw the first people on our entire tour. Two men in old-fashioned surgical scrubs spattered with gore stood over a body on the table. Their scalpels danced over the torso of the body as the person convulsed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re losing him!\u201d one of the men shouted. \u201cGet me more ether! We have to calm him down!\u201d\n\nThe other doctor grabbed a bottle and a breathing mask but the man on the table smacked their hands and sprung to his feet. He darted toward the window and pressed his body against the glass. His open wound looked\u2026 so real. Flecks of blood smeared the window as his organs pulsed and pushed from the cavity.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to help me!\u201d he panted. \u201cGet me out of here! We have to escape!\u201d\n\nWithout a word, the four of us darted away from the window and ran down the hall as quickly as we could. Pushing through a set of double doors, we entered another dimly lit room and began to pant. After a few moments, we began to chuckle.\n\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Jimmy shouted. \u201cThat was wild! This was worth it. Do you guys\u2026 oh man. Look at the walls.\u201d\n\nWe looked around to see dozens of quarter-sized metal doors lining the walls.\n\nIt was the morgue.\n\n\u201cShould we look inside?\u201d Carlos asked as he approached one of the doors.\n\nBefore I could even respond, he tugged at the rusted handle and pulled it open. Leaning into the darkness to get a better look, he began to talk before a pair of ivory arms wrapped around him and pulled him inside.\n\nWe darted to the door and opened it, but no one was inside. It was no larger than a coffin and we couldn\u2019t see a trap door. We searched the other coolers one by one, calling Carlos\u2019 name but there was no sign of him.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Jimmy said. \u201cThis has to be some kind of joke. He\u2019s messing with us.\u201d\n\nSuddenly the room filled with the sound of hands thudding against the metal doors of the morgue coolers. In full panic, the three of us ran from the room and back to our car. On the way, we saw that the nurse and the admission table were gone.\n\nWe drove straight home and told our parents everything.\n\nCarlos\u2019 family called the police to report their son missing. After investigating, the detectives reported that when they made contact with the organization that ran the sanatorium, it wasn\u2019t due to open for another week.\n\nThere was no staff there that day.\n\nWe never saw our friend [again.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtripp14/comments/uyezti/making_it_easier_to_keep_track_of_my_new_releases/)",

When I hear stories like this, of people being dragged off to places unknown, I get very curious as to *where* exactly they went. What happened to them? Certainly nothing good but there\u2019s many options. Instant death? Torture? A fate worse than death? Sometimes we get hints but often it\u2019s simply unknown. The possibilities disturb  and intrigue me in equal measure. \n\nAs for poor  Carlos? Something tells me that he had an unscheduled surgery.",

What you even *put* behind a door so small?!\"\n\nI sat there trying to imagine what a bunch of small, round doors would look like - and beginning to dredge up some feelings of trypophobia - while at the same time, trying to figure out why these doors would even exist. But because they were both such obscure questions, I couldn't answer both at the same time. \n\nThen I thought, \"The only metal doors that I can think of that would be smaller than a standard door, would be the doors on the drawers where they keep bod- \u2026 oh. *sigh* \u2026 bodies in a morgue. Duh. 'Quarter-sized' does not mean 'the size of a quarter,' or 'the size of a 25-cent coin.' It means 'a quarter of the size of a standard door,' or '\u00bc the size of a standard door.'\"\n\n\"That was *not* that hard, u/AphroditesGoldenOrbs. *In fact,* I can just about *guarantee* that you are the ***only one*** who struggled with those words.

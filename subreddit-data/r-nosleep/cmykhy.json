    "postText": "Last time: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clvga9/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app\n\n\nWhen I saw her out the window, garden shears being gripped by both hands and a maniacal expression on her face, I just stood still. \n\nI was frozen to the spot in shock. I felt no pain at all from the burn on my face, everything was numb. The relief of eradicating the imposter neighbours and the joy at finding a friend in Derek was hacked away in an instant. Just like every leaf from my shrubs. Why would she do this? What had I ever done to her? \n\nEvery question possible crossed my mind. I could feel the frustration bubbling inside me, everything about this place just threw up question after question and for every answer I got, there were ten new questions waiting to be asked. At that moment in time though, only one was truly important. \n\nHow did Prudence know? \n\nI thought about Terri and her telephone conversations. I didn\u2019t want to think that the sweet lady I thought Terri had turned out to be would do that, but it did cross my mind. I thought of Ian the postman, I\u2019d had bad vibes from him for a while, maybe he\u2019d seen Derek coming up the stairs while on his rounds that morning.\n\nI stood there frozen pondering all these things until I saw Prudence collapse onto the memorial bench sobbing, head in her hands. She was surrounded by the remains of my attempt at a garden with the shears laid out on the floor. \n\nThe stairs were kind to me on the way down, it took 4 flights to make it to the bottom. I ran down the corridor and out the back entrance of the block, no idea what I was going to say. \n\n\u201cPrudence!\u201d Was all I could manage. Nice one, Kat.\n\nShe sat bolt upright before turning and standing quicker than I thought it possible for an old lady. \n\n\u201cYou evil, stupid little girl! Do you have any idea what you\u2019ve done?!\u201d She screamed, so much animation in her face that the spaces between her wrinkles pulsated like veins on an angry weightlifter. \n\n\u201cMe?! You think I\u2019m evil! You left that shitty note hidden, missing everything I need to know and got my boyfriend killed! And what you\u2019re doing to your own -\u201c I screamed, tears beginning to roll, before she interrupted me. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare talk about her!\u201d Her voice cracked and she broke down again, this time falling to her knees, twigs and leaves sticking to the bottom of her dress. \n\nI didn\u2019t know what else to do. So I sat down on the floor. I knew that it was probably a bad idea, this woman couldn\u2019t be trusted and I hadn\u2019t forgotten that, but seeing an old lady crying on the cement floor still made me feel awful.\n\n\u201cHow did you know about the garden?\u201d I asked her calmly, trying to change my approach. \n\nShe shoved a crumpled up piece of paper into my hand, she didn\u2019t look at me, her eyes remained on the floor. \n\n*Dear Prudence,*\n\n*I couldn\u2019t exist knowing what I\u2019d done.*\n\n*I should never have told you about it.*\n\n*The last two won\u2019t grow stronger, she was never theirs to begin with. But I have to end her suffering.*\n\n*I\u2019m sorry.*\n\n*Derek*\n\nI knew what he had done as soon as I finished the note. Lyla, or what was left of her, was gone for good. Of all the creatures only Jamie\u2019s killers from the lift remained. That\u2019s how Derek had spent the few hours I\u2019d slept between our encounters. \n\n\u201cThis is all your fault.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cMy whole family are gone because of you.\u201d\n\nThat hurt a lot. I trembled as I tried to speak but I always really hated confrontation and I could feel myself starting to glitch. \n\n\u201cH..how can you say that! I saw... her and she was trapped in a tiny cage eating dog food and small animals. Your family died in that lift. Just like my Jamie.\u201d I may have struggled to get my words out, but I wasn\u2019t about to let Prudence Hemmings blame me for her decisions. Lyla was better off dead than what she was, however awful that may sound. \n\n\u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d Prudence growled at me. \u201cTake you to visit floor number 9? He did this to her in the first place, not me! And now he\u2019s disfigured you!\u201d She was spinning things. I could feel throbbing as she mentioned my face, I really should have had medical attention. \n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t his fault! You messed him up and he did that to her because of you! You told me that yourself.\u201d I tried ferociously to defend Derek but something inside me still felt uncomfortable about what he had done. I couldn\u2019t help it, Lyla was an innocent little girl who shouldn\u2019t have been punished for Prue\u2019s mistakes. This whole thing was such a mess.\n\n\u201cI was grieving! And then I had her back for all those years, and then I lost Bernie, and then my home and now I have to grieve for her all over again.\u201d Prudence continued to cry, but softer. I looked around at the chaos she created and up at the block my boyfriend had died in and rolled my eyes in disbelief that she could be so selfish. She continued.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you about Lyla. She was a beautiful little girl. As I mentioned before, I have two other older children, they\u2019ve had many other grandchildren, however I hadn\u2019t spoken to my eldest two in years even before what happened with Lyla. \n\n\u201cLyla was my first opportunity to get to know one of my grandchildren. Bernie adored her too, always reading her stories and sneaking her sweets. \n\n\u201cI begged my son to allow her to stay. My children were all incredibly ungrateful, they had it easy growing up and still resented me. I gave them a good, strict upbringing but they didn\u2019t appreciate it. They said I was a cruel mother. Lyla\u2019s dad was the only one I spoke to, but our relationship still wasn\u2019t that of a typical loving mother and son. But she was a second chance. \n\n\u201cIt was a miracle when he agreed. I was more shocked he had convinced his wife to allow it. That awful harlot of a woman never liked me, although I didn\u2019t like her either. \n\n\u201cThey refused to speak to me after everything, I haven\u2019t heard from them since. They had more grandchildren I\u2019ll never meet. I knew at the time my relationships with any of my children were over for good. So when Derek gave me a solution I took it.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t entirely truthful when we first spoke. I said I hadn\u2019t wanted this, but I was desperate. There was never a way to bring her back safely. Derek explained what she would become to me. He was initially trying to put me off even trying to get her back. I knew exactly what I was getting myself into. \n\nBut I couldn\u2019t pass up the idea of my beautiful little Lyla, needing her grandma forever. I suppose I was too ashamed to admit it before. But why should I be ashamed?\n\n\u201cMy altercation with Derek happened after she was back, when he tried to kill her the first time. Spouting the same things on that note, what kind of monster wants to kill a little girl? That\u2019s why I trashed the garden. He said he wasn\u2019t coping with the news of the new block when he suggested it, that he shouldn\u2019t have told me it was even possible and she had to die. I hid her until the bulldozers came in. \n\n\u201cWhen he disappeared I thought I was safe to spend the rest of my life with her. \n\n\u201cBernie hated me. Spending time with Lyla was all I lived for, I grew to love her how she was.\u201d\n\nI felt sick. Listening to Prudence talk bought up so many repressed feelings about Jamie. I hadn\u2019t had time to grieve or process anything, I missed him terribly. My old life and my old future felt a million miles away.\n\nI was relieved to know that Derek hadn\u2019t tricked Prudence, or even intended to create rat-Lyla. He was truly good.\n\n\u201cBut she didn\u2019t get to have a life. You lived for her but she wasn\u2019t really living. How could a sane person do that to their own flesh and blood?\u201d I retorted.\n\n\u201cYou have no idea. This place can make you do irrational things! But she had a life! She had me. It\u2019s all she needed.\u201d She was certainly right about the building and irrational actions, the pain intensifying on my face throbbed in agreement. But I was still convinced she had lost it Dr Frankenstein style where rat-Lyla was concerned. \n\nShe had stopped crying. Her rage levels were rising again. I tried to tell her that it wasn\u2019t really the child she\u2019d known, but she seemed to have grown an entirely new attachment to the creature that replaced what she lost. \n\nEvery rational argument I gave was met with increasing levels of screaming. She got less coherent as she went on. The argument was going nowhere, we went back and forth for what felt like forever.\n\nAfter a while she started to get closer to me. We had both stood up by this point and despite her haggard and frail appearance, Prudence was truly frightening. She looked unhinged. \n\nHer words were no longer going in, I was overwhelmed and had too many thoughts rushing through my mind to process her ranting. I took a few steps back clearing a small distance between us. \n\nBy this point, out of the corner of my eye, I could see neighbours in windows of the block, watching the altercation outside, Prue\u2019s screaming had bought a lot of attention. It was bright and I couldn\u2019t see well but I turned to scan the windows and did recognise Eddie and Ellie watching from their bedroom, trying to wave at me. \n\nThey frantically waved and pointed, I tried waving back and gesturing to them, but they kept pointing at me.... why were they pointing?\n\nThen I heard it, the garden shears scraping against the ground as Prudence picked them up and charged towards me. \u201cYou ignorant little bitch! You aren\u2019t even listening. You\u2019re don\u2019t deserve my home! You killed her!\u201d\n\nThe twins had been telling me to turn around, I shouldn\u2019t have taken my eyes off her. \n\nLuckily, unlike my earlier shock when I had first seen her, I didn\u2019t freeze. My fight or flight instincts kicked in and I ran faster than I ever have before. I burst back into the building and heard neighbours on the bottom floor lock their doors in a symphony of bolts clicking. \n\nI couldn\u2019t blame them. Prudence wasn\u2019t far behind me and I wouldn\u2019t want to take her on in her current state if given a choice. But it didn\u2019t stop me pounding on their doors begging someone to call the police, although something told me that in this building that wasn\u2019t going to happen. I ran up the stairs, still being followed by her. \n\nBy the second floor most were still locked but a few had come out of their homes, armed with a variety of heavy objects. Even in a crisis, I couldn\u2019t fault the community spirit here. I ran another flight of stairs that became two but still lead me to floor 3 and then to the back of the corridor. I pounded on Terri\u2019s door.\n\nMy heart was racing but when I turned Prue was nowhere to be seen. I was hoping the people who came out on floor 2 had stopped her but something was odd. I hadn\u2019t heard any commotion. This wasn\u2019t the end of it.\n\nEddie and Ellie hugged me tight as Terri let me in and bolted the door shut quickly behind me. I told her about what had happened. She couldn\u2019t believe what Prue had done. It turned out no one knew about Lyla. \n\nI was edgy for the first hour. But Prue had disappeared. Terri helped to clean up my burn and put some cold compress on it. She offered to take me to the hospital, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nI was too shaken up from what had just happened, I couldn\u2019t face trying to explain how I\u2019d sustained my injuries and I still hadn\u2019t reported Jamie missing. He still hadn\u2019t had any messages from his family, and work had given up calling, but his friends had started. They were harassing me non stop but I had been too distracted to come up with a decent lie.\n\nIt had been a week since I moved in and it wouldn\u2019t be long until people realised something was seriously wrong. My conversations with my family had been short, with me insisting they didn\u2019t visit until we were \u201cunpacked and set up\u201d. \n\nOn top of a murderous old lady and an untold amount of abnormal issues the real world problems were starting to creep up on me. \n\nI sat with Terri for hours, drinking tea and chatting to her. It started to get dark and Eddie and Ellie came into the living room after playing in their room for a while. The voids replaced the big, brown puppy dog eyes again and their claws looked especially sharp, but to me they were still adorable. \n\nTheir transformation prompted me to head back to my flat, it was late. I needed to work out what to do next and how to dig myself out of this giant hole. I couldn\u2019t just keep planting gardens. I needed to do this myself. \n\nI wandered up the stairs, they went on for a while, but nothing too horrific. I passed the man on floor 5, nodding politely and continuing my ascent. I wondered if he\u2019d received the letter of concern yet, he was a little unsettling. \n\nWhen I got to my floor Mr Prentice was making his animal noises again. I smiled, which hurt my face. After all the madness I was starting to find the seemingly benign horrors of this building oddly comforting. \n\nI reached my flat and turned the key in the door before bolting myself in like Terri had. \n\nI could feel something wasn\u2019t right the moment I entered. The flat was in chaos, which was nothing new because we had only moved in a week ago and I had been too preoccupied to unpack. But things were out of place, the organised chaos wasn\u2019t how I\u2019d left it. \n\nThen she strolled out of my kitchen. Prudence Hemmings. She was carrying a large carving knife in her left hand this time, she had prepared for her attack. She smiled at me and lifted her right hand, jingling a set of keys that she had entered with. \n\nI turned to unbolt the door but she grabbed me from behind before I could turn the handle to open it and held the knife to my throat. \n\n\u201cI will kill you for what you\u2019ve done.\u201d She whispered into my ear. \n\nWithout a second thought I leaned forward just a tad and swung my head back as hard as I could. I couldn\u2019t believe that it worked but I must have broken her nose. Prudence dropped the knife and clutched her face, blood streaming between her fingers. \n\nI went to grab the knife but she was closer and doing the same thing. I had no other option but to run again. I grabbed the door handle and turned it to exit the flat as she tried to stab me. I was mostly out the door, but her arm was close enough to reach my side, and I felt the knife pierce the side of my torso.\n\nI was in searing pain but I didn\u2019t stop running. As I stepped outside my flat I could still hear Mr Prentice\u2019s noises flooding the entire hallway. It gave me an idea. \n\nI ran towards his door, Prudence stabbing at me frantically with blood gushing from her nose. A few got me as I stopped outside flat 48, the pain was awful and I could feel myself starting to drift out of consciousness, I was losing a lot of blood. \n\nI would give my last breath to end Prue. So running on nothing but adrenaline I knocked hard on flat 48, and shouted.\n\n\u201cMr Prentice, can you help me?\u201d\n\nIt was a shot in the dark, I didn\u2019t know what would happen but I had to try something.\n\nShe had stopped stabbing at me, she was enjoying watching me bleed out slowly from the wounds she had already inflicted.\n\nI was incredibly weak, and I lost consciousness not long after that, but before I did I heard heavy clunking from the inside of flat 48, chain locks being released and bolts being undone. I watched with blurry vision as a large creature, that I can only describe as a cross between a bull and a wolf, charged out of the flat and trampled the old witch to death. I heard hear bones crunch just as slipped away. \n\nI woke up in the hospital a day later. My parents were there as were the police, apparently I had been found just outside the tower block with my handbag missing, by a neighbour who had been watching from a window as it happened. \n\nThe police told me that the person had seen the mugging out of their window. They had seen two men approach me and Jamie, splash something in my face, attack us, and when he tried to fight back, they bundled my boyfriend into a car, which the police had been searching for to no avail. He was officially missing. \n\nI was baffled, but grateful that Jamie\u2019s disappearance wouldn\u2019t be blamed on me. I went along with it and made out that he had ghosted work to enjoy our first week living together. \n\nI had been stabbed 4 times but thankfully in all the right places, if there is such a thing as the right place to be stabbed. I lost a lot of blood but I was going to be fine. They were all shallow. They assumed my burns were chemical and happened during the mugging too. \n\nThe police promised to keep us updated but they still can\u2019t find the car. They never will. I wish the story the police had been told were true, it left some hope for Jamie. \n\nMy parents weren\u2019t keen on me returning to the flat after what happened, they said the area was too rough, and that I was living proof it wasn\u2019t safe. They offered to collect my stuff for me. I insisted though, told them that I wanted to see how I felt and they couldn\u2019t force me not to.\n\nI was released from the hospital two days after I woke up in there. When I arrived at the flats, it was strange. It felt like home. Despite everything, something about this place drew me to it. \n\nI took the lift for the first time since Jamie had died. I had to, I wasn\u2019t recovered enough to conquer too many stairs just yet, and I couldn\u2019t guarantee they\u2019d be kind to me. I smiled at the lack of a button 9 and winced at the thought of the creatures. \n\nAs I reached my corridor I saw Mr Prentice walking along with his newspaper and milk in a bag. He turned to me and smiled.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d come back. It\u2019s nice to see you\u2019re up and walking.\u201d He made small talk as if I hadn\u2019t seen him literally trample a woman to death a couple of days prior. The whole experience had been so disorienting that I started to wonder if I really had been mugged and had dreamed the note and everything that\u2019s happened since. Then he said something that confirmed everything was real. \n\n\u201cI never liked that woman. But you\u2019ve got a real friend in the lady downstairs.\u201d He winked at me and turned the key in his door. \n\nI got into mine and sat down on the second hand sofa. I felt empty but relieved. With Prue and the imposter Qneighbours all gone the only threat left were the creatures in the lift, who were only a threat between 1.11 and 3.33.\n\nMaybe I could start to live a semi peaceful life in this place. \n\nTerri knocked on the door, my handbag, that I had left at hers before Prue attacked in my flat, on her arm. Mr Prentice was right, she was a good friend. \n\nI thanked her for what she\u2019d done and for what she\u2019d told the police. She said it was pure luck that she found me, she had been walking up to return the bag and found me and Prue sprawled out on the floor. I asked what happened to Prue\u2019s body and she just pointed in the direction of flat 48. \n\n\u201cHe was eating it.\u201d She said.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few days now and I\u2019ve decided to stay. I can\u2019t imagine going back to complete normality after everything I\u2019ve been through and I\u2019ve grown quite attached to some of the buildings quirks. \n\nI tried replanting the garden with the help of the twins. I ripped a few stitches doing it and Derek never came. I think he\u2019s gone for good.\n\nI\u2019m ready to fully embrace life here. The last few days have been hard but there\u2019s some time to breathe. Along with the time to breathe, came the time to grieve and I\u2019ve been grieving badly for Jamie.  \n\nThis leads me to the last thing I have to tell you. \n\nLast night I laid in bed, plagued with thoughts of Prue and everything that had happened, but what I couldn\u2019t get to leave my mind was how much happiness it bought her to have Lyla back. It infected every part of my thoughts. I know you all warned me not to, but I did it. I repeated the ritual. \n\nI haven\u2019t caught him yet, but I\u2019ve heard the scratching.

Maybe every flat had its unique quirk; flat 48 turns you into a were-bullwolf, and OP's flat turns whoever in it into a deranged tragic hero. Her actions were very similar to Prue - she figured out stuff on her own, she battled the evil of the building, she lost her loved ones, and she grew to love the building. Maybe whoever lives in that flat will slowly but surely go mad.",

This sub has seen many greats that were truly amazing but recieved only half the amount gold.\n\nApart from the ending which was *painfully clich\u00e9d* and frankly such a big disappointment; it was a very sweet read. It all felt like the earlier books of Harry Potter for some reason, which can only be a compliment, and even made me feel nostalgic.\n\nGreat work from a talented storyteller. I'm hoping to read more.\n\nAnd one thing about Jamie. If you can safely contain him within your flat you may be able to live on without any major issues. The prospect of \"the young lady living in 42 keeps her dead boyfriend in a cage\" does not seem too out of place for the building. It may be considered normal possibly following some quarrelling with and getting notices from the committee, but I'd wager that it'll be all right.

I imagine the whole ordeal made you kinda feel like Jamie would \"come back\" and when everything settled down and you could grieve you realised he wasn't.. That's enough to make anyone loose their mind. I wonder though, how did you know how to do the ritual? \n\nI hope to read another update soon!",

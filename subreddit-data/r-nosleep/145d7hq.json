    "postText": "**PART 4:**\n\nThose of you who have been following my posts know that I\u2019ve been getting sticky notes from a stalker, so you already know what to expect when I post. This time though, I need you to expect the unexpected\u2026\n\nI received another sticky note (a purple one again) and it came with another strange marking on one of the corners\u2026\n\n***\u201cYou\u2019re running out of time, little mouse...\u201d***\n\nPurple Sticky Note #2: [https://imgur.com/a/xB0E0vb](https://imgur.com/a/xB0E0vb)\n\nAll 3 Sticky Notes: [https://imgur.com/a/mpihXK8](https://imgur.com/a/mpihXK8)\n\nOne of the comments on my last post mentioned that it may be a puzzle, and that maybe I should connect the sticky notes to see if it makes a picture? Since receiving this new sticky note, I think they might just be right\u2026 I also need to address the note I got from my neighbor across the hall from me, but I\u2019ll get to that in a few paragraphs. Just bear with me and be patient... You'll understand why I saved that whole interaction for the ending of my post.\n\nSo, I finally took some time out to meet some of the other tenants on my floor. I\u2019ll document what I thought about each of them individually, and maybe some of you can help me figure out if any of them might be a suspect? Someone in my last post mentioned my landlord (Jack), but for some reason I just can\u2019t fathom him doing anything sinister? But then again\u2026 I really don\u2019t know who I can trust, can I?\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n**YESTERDAY, 4:30 PM**\n\n*Mrs. Kirtley &amp; Derek \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?*\n\n\u201cCan I help you with something?\u201d\n\n\u201cHi! I\u2019m the new tenant that just moved into 13B, I just wanted to introduce myself!\u201d Handing the woman the neatly wrapped box of cookies, I smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m Anna, nice to meet you.\u201d I figured if I was going to meet (interrogate) my neighbors, the best course of action would be to sweeten them up first.\n\nYanking the cookies from my grasp, the woman threw them on the ground and looked me right in the eye before saying, \u201cStay away from me. I don\u2019t want anything that\u2019s touched you or your apartment in my space.\u201d\n\nWith a nod, I backed away and quickly apologized before she slammed the door. Confusion bubbled within me and my eyes couldn\u2019t help but water when I saw the box on the ground. The cookies had all toppled out, some of them broken. The twine had come loose during the tumble. Crouching down, I scooped up the pieces and the crumbs and shoved them back into the box. Embarrassment burned at my cheeks as I scrambled to do so as fast as I could. Most of them fell onto her welcome mat which looked incredibly pristine before my unwanted cookies landed on it. Maybe she just didn\u2019t take kindly to visitors? I know I certainly didn\u2019t feel very \u201cwelcome\u201d. My first impression of this woman was that she wasn\u2019t very pleasant in the slightest. I didn\u2019t even get her name. She was a willowy looking woman with thin gray hair and unusually blue eyes. Upon first glance, she didn\u2019t even look as if she could hurt a fly, but her words said otherwise.\n\nBefore I could stand back up though, I felt a hand on my shoulder. A gasp escaped my lips and I jerked, the touch catching me off guard. Before I knew it, my elbow connected with a face and in the same instant I heard a slight groaning sound. Dropping the cookies, I turned around to see a man. I cringed when I noticed his hand clutching his nose, blood continuing to seep out from beneath his fingertips.\n\n\u201cOh my gosh! I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d Rushing across the hallway to my door, I hurriedly pulled it open and called out to him, \u201cStay right there!\u201d Grabbing a handful of napkins, I ran back out into the hall and handed them to him, guilt clawing at my insides. If only he knew why I was so jumpy. I\u2019d been on nothing but high alert for days\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m so sorry! I didn\u2019t even hear you walking up to me.\u201d\n\nA small chuckle escaped his lips as he took the napkins from my hands and held them up to his nose. \u201cYou sure are a lot stronger than you look, that\u2019s for sure. I think you broke it.\u201d\n\nA million more apologies danced on the tip of my tongue and I started to recite them all before he cut me off and said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright! It wouldn\u2019t be the first time after all.\u201d\n\nI looked up at him curiously and he was quick to answer me.\n\n\u201cFirst time was during a boxing match with a buddy.\u201d His hand applied steady pressure to the area, but the napkin was quickly filling up as he continued to speak. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you, but I caught the tail end of your encounter with our friendliest neighbor, Mrs. Kirtley.\u201d The sarcasm in his voice was enough to make me crack a little grin. After my incident with that woman, I could really use a kind face. Before I could respond though, he was introducing himself. \u201cI actually live right across from Mrs. Kirtley. My name\u2019s Derek.\u201d\n\nDerek was tall and slim and athletic looking. He looked like the type that probably ran track in highschool?\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s very nice to meet you, Derek. I hate that your first impression of me wasn\u2019t exactly\u2026\u201d I trailed off again before I continued, embarrassed that I let my paranoia get the better of me. \u201cI, um, just moved in right across the hall here, do you want to come in for a bit? I\u2019ve got a first aid kit -\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I\u2019m fine! Really!\u201d His eyes darted in the direction of my apartment. The look on his face mirrored the same look I received from Mrs. Kirtley\u2026 Fear?\n\nI didn\u2019t want to be pushy, but I also felt the extreme need to atone for my actions. Looking at the ground he shuffled his feet some as I spoke. \u201cPlease? I feel horrible about your nose. I\u2019ve already made one bad impression, and the last thing I\u2019d want is for another one.\u201d\n\nGlancing up at me, he looked at his watch and then finally relented. \u201cI guess I could come in for a bit. You did hit me pretty hard after all. Not the nicest way to greet a neighbor\u2026\u201d My cheeks once again burned red before I broke out into laughter. His sarcasm was much needed and my laughter only seemed to push him onward. \u201cI mean, if you greet all your neighbors like that-\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly the nice ones.\u201d I interrupt, the corners of my mouth tugged up into a cheeky grin. His face mirrored mine as he made his way into my apartment.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re witty.\u201d He responded, \u201cI like it. We could use a little of that around here. Most of the other neighbors are pretty dry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said as I grabbed the first aid kit from my bathroom, \u201cI\u2019m glad that I\u2019ve offered some much needed change around here then.\u201d\n\nOpening the kit, he pilfered through it till he found the gauze. Shoving some of it into his nose, he looked over at me and pointed to my freezer. \u201cYou got a bag of frozen peas or somethin\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I actually might!\u201d Handing him the peas, he winced a little as he held the bag to his nose.\n\n\u201cThanks\u2026? Sorry, I never caught your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s Anna! I was too busy trying to knock you out to introduce myself, I guess.\u201d A small laugh slipped past my lips when he shook his head and smiled back.\n\n\u201cInjury aside, you seem like a nice girl, so I\u2019ll forgive ya this time!\u201d Once again, his words were coated in just the right amount of sarcasm. Setting down the peas, he rubbed the bridge of his nose gingerly.\n\n\u201cWell..\u201d I started awkwardly, \u201cI would have brought you some cookies too, but unfortunately those all ended up on Mrs. Kirtley\u2019s welcome mat\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean these?\u201d Setting on my coffee table was the crumbled box of broken cookies. I\u2019d forgotten to even grab them after all the commotion.\n\n\u201cYes, actually! Thank you for grabbing those for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course. I ate a piece of one while you were looking for the first aid kit, and I\u2019ve gotta hand it to ya, you\u2019re a pretty decent baker.\u201d\n\nBrushing back a strand of my hair and tucking it behind my ear, my face lit up just the tiniest bit at that remark. Having a friend would be nice\u2026 But could I trust him??\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n**TODAY**\n\nThe person I needed to meet the most lived right across from me and right beside Derek. He was the one that left me the note\u2026 And he was also the neighbor I was the most hesitant about meeting for that exact reason.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n**YESTERDAY, 5:00 PM**\n\n*Dr. Matt Pryor*\n\nKnocking on his door took me at least a good 5 minutes. 3 minutes trying to figure out what I would even say and 2 minutes trying to convince myself to knock. But when I finally did, he was quick to answer.\n\n\u201cHi, you were the one who left me the-\u201d\n\n\u201cCome inside.\u201d\n\nThe abrupt way in which he cut me off was slightly unnerving. I knew he\u2019d probably been expecting me since he left that note on my doorstep, but I didn\u2019t expect him to be so eager to see me?\n\nThe first thing I noticed when I stepped into his apartment was how insanely clean it was? It almost looked as if no one lived there at all. His apartment was very modern and everything was either in a shade of gray or black. It felt very... Sterile?\n\n\u201cTake a seat.\u201d He said, instructing me to sit on one of the couches in the living room.\n\nHis strange demeanor was only proving to make me more nervous and uncomfortable, but despite his off-putting way of speaking, I knew I needed to hear him out.\n\n\u201cI apologize for coming across so\u2026\u201d He trailed off before changing the subject and holding out a hand in my direction. \u201cDr. Pryor, but you can just call me Matt.\u201d\n\nMatt looked to be of Italian descent. His hair was thick and dark and his face sported a couple of wrinkles above his forehead that led me to believe that maybe he was in his 40\u2019s or 50\u2019s? And he was dressed in formal attire. He donned black slacks, a white dress shirt with sleeves rolled up to his elbows and his tie was slightly loosened.\n\nShaking his hand, I tried to paste a smile across my face and offer my own pleasantries. \u201cI\u2019m Anna, nice to meet you.\u201d\n\nNodding, he sat back in his chair and steepled his fingers together in thought for a few moments before he finally broke the silence. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering why I left that note on your doorstep. I didn\u2019t mean for it to come across as strange, and I hope you didn\u2019t take it that way, but I felt like I needed to warn you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWarn me of what, exactly?\u201d My own fingers fidgeted with a stray piece of string that had come loose at the bottom of my blouse.\n\nHe sucked in a quiet breath and appeared sort of apprehensive. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure how to say this without it sounding strange, but\u2026 I\u2019ve been keeping an eye on you.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me...?\u201d My breathing stilled for a moment and my eyes darted towards his door.\n\nHe instantly noticed my change in expression. \u201cI- It\u2019s not like that.\u201d Stuttering over his words, he rubbed the bridge of his nose before saying, \u201cWhat I mean is that I\u2019ve noticed someone exiting your apartment\u2026 But I\u2019ve never seen them enter.\u201d\n\nEvery hair on my body stood on end at his words. \u201cWhat\u2026 What do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I mean is that I find it incredibly concerning that this person is somehow able to get into your apartment other than using your door\u2026\u201d His eyebrows were knitted together in worry. \u201cHave you\u2026\u201d He paused. \u201cHave you been noticing anything strange? Things moving in your apartment perhaps??\u201d\n\nI instantly paled. \u201cI\u2019ve been\u2026 Receiving strange notes. Sticky notes left in different places. Up until recently, they have only ever been in my apartment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I just\u2026 I wanted you to know that I\u2019m looking out for you. Whoever it is has been incredibly good at hiding their identity, because I cannot explain to you for the life of me what this person looks like.\u201d\n\nI watched as his hands carded through his hair. This man was just as on edge as I was, and in a way, it was almost sort of comforting to know that I wasn\u2019t alone in feeling absolutely terrified.\n\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t recall any details about what this person looks like?\u201d I questioned.\n\nScratching the stubble on his chin, he sat quietly for a few moments before commenting. \u201cI honestly cannot tell you anything appearance wise. Every Time I\u2019ve seen them leave, they have always been covered. Black hoodie, black pants, black shoes. I can only guess based on the height and build that it might be a man?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe handwriting on the sticky notes makes me believe that he is a man as well.\u201d\n\nNodding, he sat in silence for a beat or two before he looked down at his watch. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got some errands I need to run so I will see you out, but I just wanted you to know that I\u2019d be on the lookout for any more suspicious activity.\u201d\n\nReaching out, I shook his hand again and thanked him before leaving.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n**TODAY**\n\nIn the end, I don\u2019t know if meeting my neighbors really shed any light on the situation, but it was a relief to have my suspicions validated and to know that I wasn\u2019t absolutely crazy. That someone had really been in my apartment. But then there was the chilling statement I\u2019d heard him say that still continued to bother me\u2026 It was playing over and over in my head like some sick mantra.\n\n*\u201cWhat I mean is that I\u2019ve noticed someone exiting your apartment\u2026 But I\u2019ve never seen them* ***enter***.\u201d\n\nSomehow, whoever this psycho was, he was accessing my apartment\u2026 **From the inside.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you missed PART 3: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/144i2aw/i\\_think\\_ive\\_got\\_a\\_stalker\\_and\\_he\\_sends\\_me\\_sticky/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/144i2aw/i_think_ive_got_a_stalker_and_he_sends_me_sticky/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

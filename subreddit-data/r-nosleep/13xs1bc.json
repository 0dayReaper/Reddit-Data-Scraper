    "postText": "Ya know, I was about to start this gruesome tale with a funny opening. Like, \u201cBe me. Be stoopid urban explorer. Find manmade horrors beyond my comprehension. Cry. Imitate greentext for funny.\u201d But it just seemed wrong, wrong to make fun of the helpless victims I encountered. So, I decided to instead say something more sensitive. I hope they find peace. In heaven? In the void? Outside Samsara? Wherever they believed.   \nI\u2019m an urban explorer, as I said in the title. I have seen such terrors such as \u201cCursewords spray painted to walls\u201d and \u201cS+H 4EVER\u201d. Jokes aside, I mostly just delved into condemned, but rather new buildings. Like that one office building that was built in the \u201890s and the company made a new one. Not a sanitarium with ghosts still haunting, or a pagan church with miles of catacombs. Nope. Just some boring old offices, decked out with some old Halloween decorations to draw more clicks- and more money to my empty, college kid pockets. But I was\u2026 commissioned? I guess? By some guy to explore this old hospital. Several thousand dollars were promised to me, with a hundred in advance. I was tempted to take that prepay and run, but I figured- well, it couldn\u2019t be bad. Just an old hospital.  \nThis \u201cold hospital\u201d turned out to be so, so much more.  \nI was determined. The weak, can\u2019t-play-horror-games loser I am thought I could handle it. As you\u2019ll see later, I absolutely couldn\u2019t, and I don\u2019t think anyone could, honestly. I agreed to the guy, perhaps a bit too quickly, and he sent me the coordinates. Some hulk of a castle-asylum in Montreal. I had a quick thought of Project MKULTRA, but a quick google check let me know Alan Memorial is still used, for much less sinister purposes. Thank God, honestly. I don\u2019t have the balls for that. Never will.  \nI went with some buddies- Alan, Kelly, and Iz. Alan is a bit of a weird dude, but not in the sweaty way. He fangirls over a few books, but don\u2019t we all? Kelly is a mechanic of the finest degree. She\u2019s working towards an undergrad in general engineering. Iz loves the gym, has quite a lot of muscle for a shorter girl. We all bonded over a weird night at a pub, but that\u2019s a story I\u2019ll tell another day. To make a long story short, we all have our strange encounters with the unexplainable, and we try to forget it. And we have- just normal college kids, with nothing extra special about us but Kelly\u2019s pet sugar glider.   \nAlan and Iz had been with me to a few places, to be guests in my exploring. Just those old office buildings, though. When I told them, in the group chat, Iz and Kelly were quick to accept. Alan took a bit of coaxing, but eventually agreed. After I had everyone together, I finalized the payments with that contractor- four thousand, perfect to split. I should have been more skeptical about where that money came from, but at the time, I didn\u2019t care about the legitimacy. As I said, broke college kid. We packed- a good length of rope, eight pairs of disposable gloves, and my recording equipment. Some other stuff, but it wasn\u2019t of much importance. I fueled my old \u201807 Tundra, and off we went to somewhere in Montreal.   \nWhen we got there, it gave my goosebumps. Iz laughed, and tried to break the ice with an awkward joke. \u201cKinda like Mystery Inc, huh?\u201d She was met with silence. All of us were a bit scaredy cat, grim faced. I finally sighed, and with the help of Kelly and Alan, set up my camera and mics. \u201cMake this a good one, guys. Our paychecks are riding on this one.\u201d I collected myself, and plastered on a good old YouTube face. The group followed, and I motioned a \u201c3, 2, 1\u201d.   \n\u201cHi guys! We have two big surprises for you today- number one, I have my friends Iz and Alan here, and a never-seem-before star, Kelly! We\u2019ve got a great video here, and we would all appreciate it if you could blow up my Buy me a Coffee! Onto our second exciting thing for you today; we were gifted a massive amount of funding for a new, huge project- we\u2019re here in Montreal, to explore an old, shut-down hospital! We\u2019ve heard some reports of supernatural activity here, so maybe we\u2019ll find some ghosts not yet at rest, still haunting\u2026 and they\u2019ll haunt you too if you don\u2019t smash those like and subscribe buttons!\u201c Kelly cringed a bit, and I felt a bit bad, for the clickbaity way I had to speak. Algorithm is a bitch, and this payed the bills well. I couldn\u2019t change.  \n\u201cNow, we\u2019re gonna have a look inside!\u201d We walked up the dramatic stairs, and made a few comments about how absolutely 100% not clickbait spooky it looked. As we neared the antiquated maple doors, I creakily opened into the Feather\u2019s Edge Hospital. A spew of dust and decay shot into our faces, making all of us sputter. \u201cThis place has been left for a long time, huh?\u201d I asked the camera. We continued into a reception room, with a high ceiling and a dusty, gaudy chandelier hanging from the ceiling, its old-fashioned bulbs long broken.   \nA skitter and a crash came from the dark corner, and my head turned like a whip. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d Kelly asked, already nervous. \u201cProbably a raccoon\u2026 or maybe a spector!\u201d I made a whistling noise, and Alan chuckled. Iz clicked on her flashlight, and made her way through scattered debris to a large, long desk. She swiped her finger across it, and it came back covered in dust. The desk had nearly a half inch of it, covering the surface. \u201cSeems like this place hasn\u2019t seen someone in\u2026 decades, probably.\u201d Iz observed. \u201cSeems like.\u201d Alan concurred. Eager to get on with this, I tried to seem enthusiastic as I said, \u201cLet\u2019s move on to the meat and potatoes of this place!\u201d Alan lead the charge, towards a large doorway, guarded with doors not unlike those you would see a deli. The old lock seemed rusty and broken, what looked like makeshift picks rotting in the keyway. Trying to ignore that, we strode through. A strong scent of rot permeated the air. \u201cSomething died in here.\u201d Kelly seemed like she was ready to throw up. I was close, to be honest. \u201cWow. That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s something.\u201d Alan said. \u201cLet\u2019s- agh- forge ahead!\u201d   \nNot even ten steps further, we came across out first big thing- a rolling hospital bed. Its metal frame was rusted, close to collapse. The sheets were crumpled and unmade, stained by a dark, crusty stain. Old blood. Kelly\u2019s face turned a sickly, almost cartoonish yellow-green. \u201cM-maybe we should, uh, cut the camera?\u201d I swallowed a lump in my throat.  \n\u201cWe\u2019ll just.. send this to the guy. We won\u2019t put this on the channel.\u201d I kept the camera rolling, determined to keep it in one shot. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna do this!\u201d Kelly wailed, and stepped back, one, two, and turned. She broke out in a run, and as I looked at Iz with one of those \u201clooks\u201d, I heard a sickening crack in the air. Alan whipped around, just a few milliseconds before me and Iz. I saw a shadowy hand scamper back to the corner. Kelly lay, a steady flow of crimson from her forehead, next to a blunt, yet twisted piece of metal, which was now stained with her fresh, bright scarlet blood.   \nWe stood for eleven seconds. Eleven seconds that held half my life, how eternal that moment was. Eleven seconds ago, there were four living people in this room.  \nNow, there was three.  \n\u201cWhat the fuck.\u201d Alan broke the silence with vulgarity. To be fair, I was barely an inch away from shouting obscenities. He broke into a sprint towards the doors, and pulled them open. Or, tried to. They were firmly locked. \u201cWhat the fuck. What the fuck. What in the \\*fucking\\* hell-\u201c Alan was cut off by a scamper of a\u2026 something, in the relative void of a corner. My eyes darted around, first to Iz, who was just standing there, shaking, then to the creature. At first, I thought it was another body. Vaguely human-shaped, sprawled out.   \nIts head shot up, and stared straight into me, pearly whites gleaming. Its eyelids were gone, leaving two eyes, piercing blue, wide as saucers. Staring right at me. Its jaw went slack, the not-quite-human loosening its hinges, preparing to speak. Still smiling, it said in a guttural voice, \u201cWelcome to hell.",

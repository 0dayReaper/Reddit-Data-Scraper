    "postText": "I am writing this in hopes for some help and to guide others to not have the same fate as me. I think I have made the biggest mistake of my life. It has been 5 months since it happened and I haven't been able to fix it. This phone is the only connection to the realm of my birth. My original world. I probably cannot undo my mistake but I can guide future players.\r  \n\r  \nMy phone it's Android. It has an IR blaster, the only reason I bought it, and for some reason, this phone can hold its network through dimensional change. As if it's a loophole, a glitch in the broken matrix that i was facing. Not that i could actually make any use of it because I am still here.\r  \n\r  \nThe people here look like us. They all do. They are very sapient. They look just like us. But my bones know that they don't have the same origin as I do. They are good though. Have the same societal issues, the same intolerable governing body, protestors, and unrealistic agendas, the left wing and right wing at each other's throats. People who should touch some grass have podcasts. People who should have podcasts enjoy their lives. They are humans, just like us, but they are not us.  \r  \n\r  \nThe rules stated by the urban legend still strike the same to this day if time and space follow the same routine, follow the floor number pattern, pay no heed to the lady that enters the elevator on the 5th floor, leave the building immediately if you return to floor 1, etc. I followed them all correctly, but the rules are no guarantee as to whether you will be safe or alive after your elevator journey is done, the rules only make sure the procedure is correct.\r  \n\r  \nHey you know what I will write down the rules in short, for your reference to my guidelines but the rules should always be memorized to your bones and spine, this is your SOS and your key. You will find the set of rules on any website. I suggest visiting multiple of them before you start your endeavor. Because each of them gives you different kinds of warnings, something the successful players learned from their own experience. And take this advice of reading through all of those points from this unsuccessful player.\r  \n\r  \nOne thing the rules on blog sites don't mention is the choice of which world you want to enter. Because most players enter an identical world with no electronics and no living thing around them. Only a red crossed window that's far stretched away from where ever you look and keeps on moving further away from you. My case was vaguely different.\r  \n\r  \n1. So firstly all you do is enter a building with more than 10 stories.\r  \n\r  \n2. Enter the lift via the first floor and only by pressing the \"up\" button\r  \n\r  \n3. Follow a pattern of floors, press 4 then 2 then 6 then 10 then 5.\r  \n\r  \n4. On 5 a lady shall or shall not enter your floor. Then press 1\r  \n\r  \n5. When you press 1, you will either reach 1. or you will reach 10.\r  \n\r  \n6. If you reach 1, get the f out of the building and don't come near it, not in 6-7 months i suggest.\r  \n\r  \n7. If you do reach 10 congratulations. your first part of the journey is a success\r  \n\r  \nnow Something, about the lady. Do not interact with her at any cost because of course she is not a lady, no matter how pretty she looks, oh you looked at her? alas, that's also a grave mistake. don't look at her, don't talk to her. Just ignore her total existence. If you know of the elevator game you are already aware of how you should not interact with the lady and all. But one thing is often left blurry is that what you should do if she does not enter. This was my case.\r  \n\r  \nSo my advice here: If the lady on the 5th floor does not enter. Then just hope that you do return to the 1st floor after you press it. if you do no then, and start ascending. continuously press any and every floor button for it to stop, or maybe the emergency or call button so that the staff can stop the elevator. Because if you end up reaching the 10th floor, good chances are you get to meet me and we make a cute therapy consult group for people who can't return back. :)\r  \n\r  \nI remember everything from that night so vividly. I did your usual pattern follow. I entered the lift when no one was using it. I entered 4. went up there, meh nothing happened. Then again I pressed 2. I felt a vague chill around me. As if the mechanism of the ritual was understanding my intention. I pressed 6, then after it reached 6, I pressed 2, then 10 then 5. Oh, 5. The elevator door opened. And there she was, standing with all her glory. I did not look at her. but of course, i could see her from waist to bottom. She was dressed in Russian traditional clothing. not something i was expecting from an urban legend that became popular in Korea and japan. I think her wardrobe is a good collection from all cultures. or maybe there's more like her? Who knows?\r  \n\r  \nI could feel it in my spine she was looking at me. She stopped the elevator with her foot so that the doors don't close and asked, \"Baby which floor are you going?\"\r  \n\r  \nI followed the rules, did not look at her, did not reply to her, and completely ignored her.\r  \n\r  \nShe said, \"Not much of a speaker eh? no worries have your ride. I hope you have a better life.\"\r  \n\r  \nI have no idea why she said that. Looking back I think she knew what was going to happen to me. She knew that I was not going to end up in the world most player venture into. \"Better life,\" she said.\r  \n\r  \nShe did not enter the lift and I pressed 1. The ritual, now tainted because she did not enter, worked. I reached the 10th floor. And when the doors opened, it was like nothing changed. The building I entered was a hotel. The housekeeping staff was running around. I heard children crying. Some Karen was screaming at a worker because her coffee, which she made from their amenities tasted bland. It was very confusing for me. I think I assumed the ritual did not work. And the lady was just another lady who could have been high. I walked out of the elevator and I felt great.\r  \n\r  \n\"those silly online urban legends, such lies\" I probably had muttered to myself.\r  \n\r  \nI took the lift again, reached the ground floor, and walked out of the building. Everything was going well until my head started hurting and spinning. and i was slowly passing out. and that's the exact moment i remembered from one of the posts of an earlier player \"Do not at any chance lose your consciousness. and if you do, no matter where you wake up, return to the building, re-follow the exit ritual pattern and return to your own world.\"\n\nMy head felt dizzy as I woke up. In my very room. I thought to myself, was it all a dream? Did I search so much about some damn urban legend that I had such a deeply engraving dream? For heaven's sake. I jerked myself up and got down from my bed. Even my clothing is same as the last evening.  I didn't know what was more weird, that i was wearing the clothes from my dream or that i remember the dream so vividly that i can even recall the outfit i was wearing. Also my phone was in my pocket. This is something i just never do. No matter how sleepy i am. i keep my phone on the other end of my table, in case it might just blast if the lithium goes through a thermal runaway. \n\nAND! That is when i noticed. My table. It was completely on the opposite side. No no, it is right beside my bed, just like every day but the bed, and the entire room, its opposite. As if it were mirroring the room i know. Also, It wasn't just a complete mirror. my room was smaller, just a bit in breadth. One wouldn't notice it even if they visit my room on a weekly basis. But it's my damn room of course i would know even if a fly moved differently.   \nLo and behold, that extra loss on my room, was added to my washroom. Again, one wouldn't just notice it right away. \n\nIn a nightmare-like urgency, I rushed down the stairs to call complain my mother, and that is when the realization hit me that I did, in fact, play the elevator game. My dad was there. In the kitchen. Alive and happily married. Figuratively much different from how I remember him. I stood there in shock with my mouth wide open. How could this be? I remember my father. The last time I lived with him was until I was 9.  When my parents parted ways. The last time I saw him was when I was 11, when he died. Not that I cried, he was far from what a father is supposed to be. I am 25 now.\n\n\"Good morning Sweetie!\" His voice sounded oddly different. I was utterly petrified by this moment. There was a quirky yet calming nature to his sound which creeped me out even more. I dashed out of the house while grabbing my backpack from the sofa. I could hear him call out my name in my concern. This is it. This is definitely it. I crossed the borders of the unknown realm. But why are people here? Isn't it supposed to be dark with no one in it? No electricity and all ? But there is everything. This is a whole other world, what went wrong?\n\nI had to return to my world. I ran through the roads and traffic to the hotel. Hotel Sunset. As I crossed the roads I could see it all. Cars stopping at the orange light. People walking in blue. I mean they are still following basic physics by using orange, longer wavelength for stopping cars. but does Red not exist in this world? not it does, OH MY GOD, the road lines are red. \n\nI hurried through the crowd to reach the hotel. I pulled out my phone, which was surprisingly working perfectly. *I*nternet, gps everything. It said i reached my location. \"Hotel sunset\"\n\nI looked up, it said  \"Hotel Moon shine\". I am surprised it wasn't named \"moon rise\", it'd would have been the cherry on top then. \n\nI walked in, the Interior looked the same. I waited and waited and waited for the evening to hit and the horde to lessen. I stood up and walked to the lift. I repeated the entire process.\n\nThe lift stopped at 5. Instead of the lady, someone else entered. I of course didn't look up, but they entered hurriedly, screaming my name and i had to look up, i was already freaked out at this point. It was me. I was looking at me. she, well me, or wait she? she held the lift by her foot. What's up with women in the elevator game to hold the elevator by the foot?\n\n\"what did you do!? \" I - I mean she said, one that looked like me.\n\n\"what did i do?\" i replied back. . Whoever this doppelganger was. sure i was petrified. but here i was.\n\n\"DID THE LADY ENTER YOUR LIFT ?\" she screamed at me.\n\n\"wha?\" i was trembling at her screeching was. the white portion of her eyes started to redden. \n\n\"OH MY GOD DID SHE OR NOT ENTER WHEN YOU DID THE RITUAL?\" she again proclaimed.\n\n\"she didn't.\" i replied and slowly lost my leg strength and somewhat collapsed while sitting down.\n\n\"why? why did you complete the ritual then? did you not read before you did? you are supposed to be me, you are supposed to be smart. heck, aren't you supposed to be smarter? oh my god. is that my backpack or yours?\"\n\nI just shook my head and handed her the backpack, it was hers definitely. I never put on any anime pins on mine. Speaking of anime pins, naruto here has pink hair. Isn't that cool?\n\nshe took out her phone and said \"If you want to go back home go to this tumblr account and download the app. The account is called buihotline.tumblr.com \"\n\nAnd she left. \n\nWas that the me of this universe? do we have counterparts in every universe? How many universes are there?  are these even universes the way our science teaches us universes? \n\nThe lift started to quake. the light started flickering and I could hear some noise. soft noises that slowly grew louder and louder until they became uncontrollable screams. my ear drums were hurting beyond control. until it all stopped and the lift door opened. I stepped outside. Yet I was still there at \"Moon shine hotel\". \n\nI tried the ritual again. I ended up back here. To floor 1 and I went back \"home\" to my \"dad\" and \"mom\". For the next 7 days, I kept on going back to the elevator, trying the ritual continuously and failing. On my way, I noticed new and new things about their world. These people like to greet each other in a very weird way. They grab each other's throats and smile. Almost sadistic. Language is very similar, but there are a few words and phrases here and there that have changed with customs and traditions. Honey here tastes like metal. Cows don't Moo, and birds chirp, but the sounds are unfamiliar, dogs don't exist. cats are the only domestic animals here. I read similar things in some blogs, but never did I think I would get to experience them for real.\n\nEither way. On every failed ritual, I reached floor 1 and went back home. and repeated the cycle Until the 7th day, I got so fed up, that I kept on trying multiple times. but all I did was end up on floor 1. But I saw the weirdest thing. \n\nWell, I can fill in on what happens if you immediately don't leave the building after playing the elevator game and ending up on floor 1. You see, well better than seeing failing grades or not being able to return to your own world, ghosts. Yep pretty much. Deranged souls that roam around the building.  That is exactly what you see. And once they notice your existence, god save you. If there is any. \n\nMine was rather sarcastic. They did infact noticed me. They all came running towards me, looked right at me, smelled me and then slowly moved away and kept on about roaming. My heart intensified so much, it felt like I just lost a marathon I almost won. \n\nI saw a man, maybe a bit older than me, in his 20s, walk down the entrance come and sit beside me. \"They won't attack someone who's like them. You are of no use to them. They used to belong here, but don't anymore. and you never did.\"\n\nI looked at him with a frightening shock. I took my bag and ran back home. Only when i came back home i realized he could have had answers. But i was so terrified at the moment, the only thing I could think of was getting away from him. I needed answers. I need to enter the website the other me mentioned. I got a new phone from this world. they didn't have Google, but I tell you their search engine is much better, it has AI integrated within. The account never opened from the new phone. Tumblr did.  but that account never did. Then I tried my own phone and voila! The page had nothing. A heading, a two-liner bio, and a link. Link to download the app. Tumblr happens to be one of the only few apps that do work in other dimensions. Apparently, it has something to do with the first person who jumped dimensions, not only did they jump, but they also jumped through time and made sure every world had Tumblr. It's kinda funny they could have chosen Reddit, it's much more effective.\n\nI loaded the app. Its a 2010's forum-based app. There are discussion topics under which you make threads. You got a chat box to interact with other users. the main discussion had a guide. I searched through it and finally came to the part \"how to enter and leave a mirror world\" aaand its blank. well not totally. A couple of reasons saying why you should not enter it. A bullet point that said download this pdf to know how to return back to your own world. I hurriedly clicked on it and boom the file did not open. I have never been so disappointed in my life.\n\nThere are so many dimensions else than the one with red cross and mirror dimensions. it is almost like aliens exist because some \"humans\" look so different. some people probably might even have ended up on my world as well. I wonder how they are taking it.\n\nApparently, only devices of one world present in another world, or at least have been in a few can open the website and run the apk file. Only androids work across dimensions. There's a conspiracy theory that the creators of android have got something to do with the entire interdimensional rituals and breaking the laws of space and time. \n\nEither way, hoping to get some results I posted on the site wishing for some advice on opening the file or someone just copy-pasting the rules I guess.\n\nI received a DM saying, \"Since you have successfully crossed a mirror dimension You are capable of much more than you can imagine. But you should know how to use them, you have to be responsible for every move you make\" \n\nGood lord, I am not Spider-Man. The user further said, \" I do not know where you are from, but I am from dimension 17391, go to the universal map translator and put the location, \"Kairo office main building, st. red 22209\". It will automatically give you a few building locations of your world.\" But the interface is very slow. Because it's not a singular place that has a counterpart in every dimension, there is one in every 4 hours of journey. It's an arbitrary location.  It will take some time. maybe days. But you will reach.\" \n\nI asked the user a dozen questions, how do I find the translator map, how many universes are there, and what do I do when I reach there?  Why does everyone speak English? But they never replied. But now I have something, hope. A twinge of hope. \n\nI searched around the app and found the map feature, build within the forum. It was on the top layer, but a confused me couldn't find it right away. \n\nEver since I found the map It has been nothing but a dilemma. 5 months. 5 months of intense searching and nothing. The first time I entered the location and searched, it landed me at the coordinates of a graveyard. The Irony. The second time, a fish market, the third, 3-storey guest house with the most normal Karen.  \n\nI can't even venture out every day. I have a \"life\" here that I have to maintain. This me had a similar job. Marketing manager at a pretty good company. The pay is almost the same. A bit lower here, but hey cost of living is also lower here. Putting those two together I probably have the exact same pay. But they have more facilities. Better vacation leaves. That is exactly what i took right after i downloaded the app, to understand the world better, and the changes here and there.\n\n Morning, I go to work. where I sort out the place I will visit. and after work, i leave. Some places were nearby, some were far. One was in the neighboring country, luckily, the passport here is strong. But none of them work. I think I have broken the  \"not your universe? not the place? click again\" button. Sundays and Saturdays are for long-distance locations. Also every day i cannot afford to go, even though the pay is good. In my world I used to live alone with Mum visiting me now and then. She and I had a family business along with my job, so all was good. Here I don't have a place of my own. And I gotta pay the bills around the house and sometimes take care of the business as well. Things are so similar yet different. I feel likeIi live in a deja vu.\n\nBy now i have crossed out almost 75 locations within 5 months, all of them being complete failures. I have crossed out 60 universes that aren't this one. I have made multiple posts on that app, describing my condition, where i am, and which universe it might be. If i even know this universe number and input it, the map translator will work much much better. I describe my original universe in the posts expecting someone to understand me and maybe send me a picture of my mother and friends, but all i have received are words of sympathy and hopefulness. \n\nA few more people have send me their \"kairo\" addresses but they all can send only one to two messages before the chatbox stops. One of them managed to message me that i have to enter my universe number in the settings for the interface to work better.  I also haven't been able to find the man from the hotel on the app or at the hotel either. \n\n  \nwhat do I do?  Any piece of advice?",

The one I'm in definitely isn't a complete mirror but a close one. That is why this world is similar yet uncanny. Every other world or dimension is an alternative dimension. Mirror or not.",

    "postText": "\u201cDon\u2019t get off until you hit the ninth floor. No exceptions.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut my interview is on 5,\u201d I replied.\n\n*\u201cI\u2019ll only say this only one more time. Don\u2019t get off until you hit 9th. No other floor is safe.\u201d*\n\nIt\u2019s crazy but something about the way he said it penetrated my skull. He was serious. *And*, he looked nervous, like he had to fight every instinct in his body to say that to me.\n\nThe doors closed, while I thought to myself - who the fuck says anything like that?\n\nAs I went to hit the button for the fifth floor, some anxiety came over me. I shook it off and pressed it. *The guy was probably just off his rockers.*\n\nThe elevator went up. I scanned my surroundings - a TV bolted to the top corner of the elevator (playing the weather channel), a mirror for the back-wall of the elevator, and some cozy lounge-style music playing. Pretty standard stuff.\n\n*\u201cNow arriving at the 5th floor.\u201d*\n\nWeird - not sure if I\u2019d ever been in an elevator that announced each floor it was arriving at. I was sure that if I worked in this building, this would get pretty old quickly.\n\nDING!\n\nThe doors opened on 5. In front of me was a reception area with a woman seated at the front desk. She stood up from her seat.\n\n\u201cMr. Davis! You\u2019re early!\u201d\n\nThe gentleman\u2019s warning from earlier played in my head.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be ready for your interview in a few moments. In the meantime, please feel free to take a seat.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, thank you,\u201d I responded. \u201cIf I\u2019m, uh, early, maybe I can come back in a few minutes?\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense! We\u2019ll see if we can speed things up. He\u2019s been very excited to meet you.\u201d\n\nThe elevator doors started closing. I held them open. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do here, but everything seemed fine enough. Granted, the receptionist did seem a *bit eager*, but beyond that\u2026\n\nFrom my vantage point, I scanned the office space behind the front desk area. All looked normal - cubicles, folks clicking away at their computer, a kitchen area. Pretty unremarkable.\n\nThat is, except for the portrait off at the far end of the office floor. It was very large. I couldn\u2019t tell what the picture was of, but I did see a group of employees staring at it\u2026 almost, admiring it?\n\n\u201cYour wife\u2019s name is Meredith, right?\u201d\n\nI froze as the receptionist\u2019s question shot a dart right through me. I didn\u2019t remember the job application form ever asking for my wife\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cYou two are thinking of having children, right? If it\u2019s a boy, you want to name him Sam?\u201d\n\nWhat. The. Fuck? Forget that she was right on the money, this was something I\u2019d never spoken about before to anyone, including my wife.\n\nBefore I could answer, the office workers surrounding the large portrait started singing the Happy Birthday song loudly, in complete and perfect unison. Someone brought out a birthday cake and presented it to the portrait. A portrait that, after a bit of squinting, I realized was a very large version of my highschool yearbook photo.\n\nI backed into the elevator, and pressed the \u201cclose door\u201d button. I panicked as it took its sweet time to register.\n\nPress. Press. Press. Come the fuck on.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, the doors started closing. As they closed, I heard the receptionist -\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so curious to know what your insides taste like, Michael.\u201d\n\nFuck. Me.\n\nNinth floor. I needed to go to the ninth floor.\n\nI found the 9th floor button and pressed it. It felt like it didn\u2019t register my push, so I pressed the button again. And again. Come on, come on, come on, ninth fucking floor. I tried again and again, but nothing was happening.\n\nFuck it. *I\u2019ll go back to the ground floor,* I thought to myself. Back to the start.\n\nAs I went to press the \u2018G\u2019 button, I realized it was missing. *Just that one singular button gone.* Fuck.\n\nI was getting claustrophobic. I took in deep breaths to prevent myself from having a full blown episode.\n\nThe elevator started moving up again. A panel above the elevator doors lit up with the following number: 11.\n\n*Someone was calling the elevator?*\n\nI started talking to myself to self-soothe. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, someone will call the 9th floor soon. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll get off.\u201d\n\nAs the elevator approached its new destination, I noticed that the background lounge music in the elevator had changed. It was now an instrumental arrangement of \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d. *Huh.* Not sure why this thing thought it was my birthday.\n\nI glanced at the weather report on the TV. At least it was going to be sunny all week! Silver linings.\n\n*\u201cNow arriving at the 11th floor.\u201d* DING!\n\nThe doors opened, I hung around the inside corner of the elevator beside the buttons. No need to have another nightmare-ish experience, right?\n\nAn old woman stepped onto the elevator.\n\n*Great, I\u2019m sure this will be easy to explain to her.*\n\nShe smiled at me, as the doors closed.\n\nWith a lump in my throat, I asked \u2013 \u201cWhat floor?\u201d\n\n\u201cGround floor please.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, I\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am but that button is missing. Maybe we could wait until someone calls us to the 9th floor?\u201d\n\n\u201c9th? No, I think I\u2019ll just go to the 2nd floor instead, then.\u201d\n\nShe went to press the button.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be safe to\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cI have plenty of friends on the 2nd floor. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\nAaaaaaand she pressed it. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable cornering an elderly stranger in a seemingly haunted elevator. But I tried again to convince her \u2013\n\n\u201cI know this sounds weird, but I have it under good authority that the 2nd floor probably isn\u2019t safe. I\u2019d strongly recommend not getting off until we reach 9.\u201d\n\nShe smiled.\n\n\u201cDear, it\u2019ll be alright. You know, I like to take all opportunities that are given to me. It\u2019s\u2026 a shame that you turned your opportunity down. I know the folks on 5 are very disappointed.\u201d\n\nI backed up into the corner of the elevator.\n\nI saw the reflection of the old lady in the elevator\u2019s back mirror. She looked ghastly. Otherworldly.\n\n*\u201cNow arriving at the 2nd floor.\u201d*\n\nThe doors opened. She smiled at me again, and then exited.\n\nI poked my head around the corner to look at the 2nd floor. It was damp. It looked old. More like a cave than an office. I heard a low rumble.\n\nA man dressed in a fancy suit approached the elevator doors and held them open before they could close.\n\n\u201cYou getting off here too, champ? I heard that 5 wanted you. I think we can give you a better offer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sure, bud? The salary is eight hundred thousand dollars every hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kidding bud. The salary is we remove your eyes so you don\u2019t have to see him.\u201d\n\nThe floor went pitch black. The low rumble got much louder and started reverberating in my ears. Suddenly, the businessman grabbed me by the collar and tried to pull me out of the elevator.\n\nI clung onto the ends of it. Fuck. Fuck!\n\nI started kicking and headbutting him. I was able to make him let go of me momentarily, as I desperately pressed on the \u201cclose doors\u201d button. Miraculously, the elevator responded much quicker this time and they closed immediately.\n\nI tried the 9th floor button again. Didn\u2019t work. I pressed 8 instead. *Anything to get away from this hell-hole of a floor.*\n\nI heard a loud banging on the door as the elevator started taking off. Like an aggressive knock.\n\nBANG! BANG! BANG!\n\nAs I saw the floor numbers rising -\n\n3\u2026 4\u2026 5\u2026\n\nThe banging continued. Just as loud. *What the fuck?*\n\n6th floor\u2026 7th floor\u2026\n\nThe banging on the door didn\u2019t subside.\n\n*\u201cNow arriving at the 8th flo\u2013\u201d*\n\nI pressed the button for the 23rd floor. Just as we arrived on 8, I mashed the \u201cclose doors\u201d button just as the elevator doors were about to open. The banging continued as the elevator doors started denting.\n\nThe elevator continued going up.\n\n9\u2026\n\n10\u2026\n\n11\u2026\n\nThe banging softened.\n\n14\u2026\n\n15\u2026\n\nAnd softened.\n\n19\u2026\n\n20\u2026\n\n21\u2026\n\nAnd disappeared.\n\n*\u201cNow arriving at the 23rd floor.\u201d*\n\nIt was gone. Thank fucking god.\n\nI exhaled.  It felt like I\u2019d narrowly avoided disaster.\n\nThe doors opened.\n\nI scanned the new floor, and I realized\u2026 I was back on the ground floor. That\u2019s what it looked like, anyways. *Did I escape? Was I finally free?*\n\nA man stood not-too-far from the door. He looked familiar, but I couldn\u2019t exactly place him.\n\n\u201cHey man,\u201d he spoke.\n\n*Was this the guy who got off the elevator just as I got on?*\n\n\u201c...hey.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over man. You got out,\u201d he told me.\n\nI felt a wave of relief wash over me\u2026 but I had to fight it.\n\n\u201cBut you said the 9th floor was the only safe one, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was a trick. You followed your gut and you were right. 23rd floor. The real safe floor. You can step out now, man.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t leave.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s someone here who really wants to see you.\u201d\n\n*I couldn\u2019t move.*\n\n\u201cHe wants to give you a job. He thinks you\u2019re gonna be great.\u201d\n\n*Why the fuck couldn\u2019t I move?*\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the other room. I\u2019m gonna fetch him, okay? All you have to do is look at him. It\u2019ll feel a bit weird at first, but then it\u2019ll all be okay. It\u2019s a permanent position. Great benefits. It *is* fully onsite, but, no better birthday present than a new job, right?\u201d\n\nI lowered my gaze to the floor. I forced myself to mutter the following words - \u201cIt\u2019s not my fucking birthday.\u201d\n\nAs he left to fetch\u2026 whoever he was meaning to fetch, he gave me the following response: \u201cRelax, man. No cursing on the job. We\u2019re a family here.\u201d\n\nIt felt like I could only move a centimeter at a time. A true snail\u2019s pace. I inched my finger closer and closer to the \u201cclose door\u201d button.\n\nI heard footsteps. He was coming back.\n\nWith every fiber of my being, I pushed through. I hit the button.\n\nThe doors closed, and I collapsed to the floor\u2026 free from whatever weird force was stopping me from moving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you two talk more on the elevator,\u201d I heard him say from outside the doors.\n\n*What?*\n\nInstinctively, I looked around.\n\nTo my surprise, there was nothing. The elevator was the same as it had always been.\n\nA lengthy exhale. I was done with all of this. At this point, I would\u2019ve taken death over continuing this bullshit any longer.\n\nAs I pondered my next move in this hopeless situation, I noticed something strange. The button to the 9th floor was lit up. An ominous, crimson-red color.\n\nBefore I could do anything else, my phone started ringing. I checked the call.\n\nIt was my wife.\n\nI answered.\n\n\u201cBabe. Fuck, I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t even think to call you - I\u2019m trapped in an elevator and fucked up shit is happening and maybe I should call the cops? Fuck I\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cHun. Don\u2019t go to the ninth floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? W-wait, how do you even\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a trick, honey. You have to trust me. The man from before was lying to you. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d\n\n\u201c*None of this has been safe!* How do you even know everything that\u2019s happening?!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just need to trust me, hun.\u201d\n\nI paused.\n\n\u201cSo what do you want me to do then?\u201d\n\nA demon on the other side of the phone answered this time.\n\n**\u201cGO TO YOUR INTERVIEW.\u201d**\n\nI hung up the call and in a panic, I mashed on the 9th floor button. The elevator started rising again.\n\nEven with me hanging up the call, the muffled sound of the demonic voice coming from my phone continued.\n\n**\u201cGO TO YOUR INTERVIEW.**\n\n**GO TO YOUR INTERVIEW.**\n\n**GO TO YOUR INTERVIEW.\u201d**\n\nI pulled out my phone and flung it to the ground as hard as I could. I stomped on it angrily. The warped sound of **\u201cGO TO YOUR INTERVIEW\u201d** slowly started dying out.\n\nBut suddenly, the elevator started shaking. It was continuing to go up\u2026 but it was faster than usual. Really, really fucking fast all of a sudden. Almost like the 9th floor was now *way below me.*\n\nIt felt like an amusement park ride with no breaks on it. Loose. Dangerous. Flinging up at an insane speed, almost as if it was falling upwards.\n\n\u201cBut I pressed nine?!\u201d I screamed to myself, exasperated.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter.\n\n*\u201cNow arriving at the 41st floor.\u201d*\n\nGod, what the fuck?\n\nI was brought to my knees by the speed of the elevator traveling faster and faster.\n\n*\u201cNow arriving at the 90th floor.\u201d*\n\nThe buttons didn\u2019t even go past 52.\n\n*\u201cNow arriving at the 141st floor.\u201d*\n\nFuck.\n\n*\u201cNow arriving at the 230th floor.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cNow arriving at the 401st floor.\u201d*\n\nI felt like I was inside a bullet. The pleasant voice of the elevator lady was getting deeper and deeper as we rose.\n\n*\u201cNow arriving at the 840th floor.\u201d*\n\nThe voice started croaking. A demonic sound this time \u2013\n\n*\u201cNow arriving at* **SOMEWHERE NICE.**\u201d\n\nA sudden halt. The elevator stopped. The doors didn\u2019t open though. The panel above the elevator doors had no indication on what floor we were on.\n\nAs I sat, I heard what could be best described as the sounds of hell coming from outside the elevator. Low grunts of pain. Crackling. *A dark hymn.*\n\nWas this where I was supposed to get off?\n\nBefore I could ponder the question further, I heard a soft tapping on the elevator. A voice from outside \u2013\n\n\u201cDo you want to trade?\u201d said the voice.\n\nI decided to bite, for reasons I still don\u2019t fully understand.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if you stay on this floor forever, and I get to go home?\u201d\n\n\u201cUhm. I, uh, think I\u2019m good\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I really want to go home.\u201d\n\nIt almost sounded like the voice of a kid. Fucking hell.\n\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, kid,\u201d I mustered back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nAn awkward silence between us.\n\n\u201cHe told me that he wants to wish you a Happy Birthday,\u201d said the kid.\n\n\u201cI, uh\u2026 think he\u2019s got it wrong. Today isn\u2019t my birthday.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d he responded. \u201cIt\u2019s the first day of your new life. Your birthday.\u201d\n\n\u2026?\n\n\u201cHe wants you to look at the TV.\u201d\n\n*What?*\n\nI looked at the TV in the top corner of the elevator, hoping to see the one constant I\u2019d had during this whole cursed trip - the weather.\n\nInstead, the TV was now showcasing what looked to be CCTV footage. Grainy footage from a camera\u2026 of the exact elevator I was in. *A live feed of this exact moment.*\n\nExcept, the TV showed me lying down. Looking up with a wide smile on my face.\n\nAnd something above me on the ceiling. Looking straight down at me.\n\n*Him.*\n\nThe lights in the elevator went off. The elevator plummeted downwards, as I closed my eyes and screamed for dear fucking life.\n\nI waited for the impact.\n\nFor what I knew was my demise.\n\n*Here it comes.*\n\n*Here it fucking comes.*\n\n*I\u2019m not ready.*\n\n*I\u2019m not ready at all.*\n\n*\u201cNow arriving at the 9th floor.\u201d*\n\nDING!\n\nThe doors opened.\n\n*Wait, what?*\n\n*9th floor?*\n\nI peeked out from the elevator.\n\nAnother reception desk.\n\n*Wait, is this really the -*\n\nI was interrupted by a voice from the outside.\n\n\u201cYou coming out or what you fucking moron?\u201d\n\nI got to my feet. The feeling of distrust\u2026 anxiety, whatever you\u2019d call it. My *fear intuition*. It was gone.\n\nI felt light.\n\nFuck it.\n\nI stepped onto the floor and approached the counter.\n\nThe receptionist handed me what looked like a button for the elevator.\n\n\u201cFor the ground floor,\u201d she said. \u201cSingle use only.\u201d\n\nI took it and headed towards the elevator.\n\nThen, I turned back to face her.\n\n\u201cCan I maybe take the stairs?\u201d\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t like the elevator, then you\u2019re really not gonna like the stairs.\u201d\n\n*Fair enough.*\n\nI got into the elevator.\n\nI said a silent prayer to myself as I put the button where it belonged.\n\nIt fit without any issue.\n\nI pressed it, and the elevator went down. It was a smooth ride.\n\n*\u201cNow arriving at the ground floor.\u201d*\n\nDING!\n\nAs I got ready to exit, I realized that the ground floor button was missing once again. *Strange.* I didn\u2019t linger on it.\n\nI marched out, ready to get the fuck out of this building.\n\nI noticed a woman running onto the elevator. I tried to stop her, but something in my body wouldn\u2019t let me.\n\nThe most I could muster was putting my hand on the door to relay a message to her before the doors closed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get off until you reach the 9th floor. No matter what.\u201d\n\nThe woman just smiled at me.\n\n\u201cHappy Birthday Michael.\u201d\n\n[\\+-+-+-+](https://www.reddit.com/user/WorldAwayTweedy)",

If it was meant to be him \"escaping\" and not doing what he was supposed to,  shouldn't it have been his decision or idea to leave? It just seems like the 9th floor is there to give you the ground floor button, no one asked him to stay there.",

They didn't tell him to leave, and he didn't ask any questions about whether it was safe like he did with the stairs. \n\nIt was a test where they withheld important information but never lied to him or told him to do anything dangerous. Him deciding to leave the 9th floor and thinking that the ground floor was safe and would let him exit the building was just an assumption on his part.",

Whenever I would get into an elevator in my dream I would end up riding up and up way over what is supposed to be the top floor.\n\n100, 400. You name it.

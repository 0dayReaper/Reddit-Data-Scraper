    "postText": "That nap I woke up from [earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ja7jx/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_temp_work/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) was really nice. I haven't slept this well in a long time. I'm pretty sure that's because I haven't felt this financially secure in a hot minute, and all I had to do for it was withstand an onslaught of psychological terror. I guess that's not so different from a normal workday. \n\nThe server rang at our door at four p.m. on the dot. I buzzed him in and hurried to meet him halfway on the stairs. I tried to then appear casual by leaning against the side wall.\n\nFrankie stopped in his tracks and tilted his head at me. \"It's good to see you, too, sunshine.\"\n\n\"Come in, if you want.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to?\" A sly smile crept up on his face. \n\nI huffed. \"Don't drag this out, you know I'm trying to act cool.\"\n\n\"I do know,\" he conceded, smugly blowing a gum bubble as he walked by me. \n\nKit was sitting on the couch with a plate of fries in her lap. \n\n\"Frankie, this is my roommate,\" I began. \"Kit, this is\u2014\"\n\nShe rose to her feet to offer a grease-coated handshake. Frankie accepted without hesitation before sneakily reaching into his coat pocket to wipe the salt off on a strategically placed handkerchief. \n\n\"Eva's crush from the diner, I remember, actually,\" Kit said, nodding steadily. \n\n\"My what now?\"\n\n\"Yeah, her what now?\" the waiter echoed.\n\n\"Nothing.\" Kit sat back down and stuffed her mouth with fries. \"Hey, uh\u2026 you two wanna be alone or something?\" She gestured at the TV remote.\n\n\"No, you can stay,\" I told her, trading glances with Frankie who just shrugged and smiled. \"I like cartoons,\" he began. \"We could\u2026\"\n\n\"Oh wonderful, you're just like Eva,\" my roommate muttered. \"All about the whimsical kids' shows. If you'd just give TLC a chance\u2026 You don't know what you're missing.\"\n\nWe ended up sitting together watching a cartoon called Hilda. Fran insisted on introducing me to it, and I found it very enjoyable. Even Kit seemed to like it. I'm glad we can afford certain streaming services again, even though I know it might not last. It was definitely a nice afternoon. My roommate seemed relaxed, and the warm, tickly pinprick sensation I got from Frankie being nearby added to the comfort. When night fell, the waiter got up to leave and I saw him out, following him all the way downstairs.\n\n\"So,\" he began. \"You have a crush on me?\"\n\n\"Don't you dare.\"\n\n\"Sorry, sorry!\" He soothingly raised his hands, laughing to himself. \"Anyways, not to be pushy or anything, but I had a good time today. So thanks. Same time next week?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"Maybe come by the diner in the meantime?\" He pulled a string from his gum with his finger before letting it snap back into his mouth. \"We can find out how much free stuff I can sneak you before my boss finds out.\"\n\n\"Doesn't that kind of thing get you fired? Take it from me, being unemployed sucks.\" \n\nHe grinned again, the kind of grin that made me feel like he was thinking of a hilarious private joke. \"I'll be fine,\" he said. \"Besides, it's nice to see you over there. Always so muggy lately. It's great when the sun comes out.\" \n\nThat got a pretty big smile out of me, which he mirrored. \"Exactly like that. Goodnight, Eva.\"\n\nKit was leaning in the doorway when I came back upstairs. \"So, that was something.\"\n\n\"Remind me never to introduce important people to you again,\" I gruffed, but I could tell the words hadn't stung. \n\n\"I will. But for now, come with me. I want to show you something. Oh, and\u2026 prepare for a struggle.\" She threw me an apologetic glance over her shoulder as she motioned for me to follow. She led me into the bathroom, locking the door behind us. \"Just in case.\" She turned on the faucet in the bathtub, then leaned over to stare at the steadily accumulating pool. She lowered her voice, narrowing her eyes and slowly mouthing a strange combination of vowels and consonants, unlike any I'd ever heard before. I can only describe what it sounded like; it was breathy and soft, each syllable dripping from her tongue.\n\n*\"Anh'naishou.\"*\n\nAt this, the water began to churn and a rumbling erupted from the depths of the drain. It slowly grew in volume, turning into a hellish, hair-raising gurgle. I shrank back, covering my ears in a desperate attempt to block out the noise. My eyes grew wide when slowly, one by one, long red *sticks* began to emerge from the depths of the drain. No, not sticks. *Legs.* The segmented appendages ended in sharp, pointed hooks that scratched the inside of the tub as they pulled itself out. Two of them dug into its sides, pulling themselves further up as more and more legs followed.\n\nDread seeped into my bones, my heart dropping into my stomach. They grabbed onto the walls, then the ceiling, clinging and holding on tightly before finally, the rest of the thing's body pierced the surface. How it had fit through the pipes was beyond me, but I knew better than to question technicalities when I was faced with an enormous, monstrous approximation of a spider crab. \n\n\"Kit, what did you do?\" I yelled out, hastily pulling off my shirt to make room for my unfurling tentacles. \n\n\"Been meaning to get you outta those clothes, actually!\" she barked, nervousness swinging along in her voice even as she let out a forced laugh. \"For real though, I just wanted to show you what\u2014\"\n\n\"Bad idea,\" I hissed when one of the crab's claws took a swing at me. I jumped back, pressing my back up against the wall. I was too slow to dodge it completely, though, and I whined when it scratched my skin. \n\n\"Oh fuck, Eva, did it hurt you?\"\n\nI wrapped a tentacle around the leg that had cut me, putting as much pressure on it as I could before finally, it snapped. The creature let out a\u2026 I don't know how to describe the noise it made, but it was bordering on the demonic. The thing was towering above us. Two more claws shot forward to grab me, and I ducked just in time. The crab snarled, beginning to shift from its position below the ceiling corner to slowly move towards my roommate, its every movement accompanied by a clicking sound as its hooks met with the walls and the floor. \n\nKit staggered back, whimpering as the creature slashed out at her. I cried out, lunging to bring myself between her and it. Jumping up, I managed to wrap my arms around its head, splaying my tentacles to intercept its spindly legs curling around me. I dug my fingers into every nook of its shelled body that gave way, violently tearing as it snapped its teeth-like protrusions at me. \n\n\"Kill it!\" Kit shrieked, and even through the frenzied fear that seemed to have bled into every last one of my senses, I managed to hurl an insult at her. \n\nAnd then something funny happened. \n\nI got the idea of biting it, but I figured my mouth wouldn't be big enough. I tried anyway, parting my lips as far as I could. And my jaws seemed to comply. I felt a tear splitting my cheeks, a painless ripping sensation, and suddenly, my mouth hung open wider than ever before. I plunged my teeth into its carapace, and by some miracle, they pierced right through it. I bit down harder, and I heard a loud *crack*. The creature sank to the floor, crumbling down with me still on top of it. I slowly extracted my fangs, licking the weird, drippy fluids that had come out of the crap off my face with a tongue that seemed a lot longer than before. I then turned to fix Kit with a death glare. \n\n\"Holy shit,\" she rasped out. \"Evangeline, you\u2026 your mouth\u2026\"\n\n\"What?\" I growled.\n\n\"N-nothing! I just\u2026 I mean, that sure is new! That fang-thing. Is it, like, permanent?\"\n\n\"What do I know? And what in the hell were you thinking?\" I bellowed. \"What was that, an impromptu gladiator fight?\"\n\n\"I don't know, I just wanted you to\u2026 to see what I was dealing with.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I heaved, \"I think I got a pretty good impression.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry! I don't even know\u2014I actually thought it would be okay! Just so you know, that wasn't a summoning, or anything. I said something in a really old language, *my* language, and what it meant was basically a provocation. I knew something would hear me and respond. They always do. I'll clean up this mess, I promise. Let's not delay this. You wanted to talk.\"\n\n\"If you can.\"\n\n\"Not everything. It's bad mojo, I don't wanna risk anything by telling you too much.\" Here, she lowered her voice. \"It's hard to tell whether or not they're listening.\"\n\n\"Oh, because you're so cautious all of a sudden?\" I led her out into the living room and gestured at the sofa. \"Let's sit down for this.\"\n\n\"That might be best, actually. But\u2026 I don't wanna do this on my own. We should\u2026 we should trade.\"\n\n\"Trade? As in, I go first and then you?\"\n\n\"That's what I was hoping for. So. What are you?\"\n\nI straightened up in my seat. \"I don't know.\"\n\nKit chuckled. \"That's something I might actually envy you for. I know what I am, but I'm not happy with it.\"\n\n\"Were you ever human? At any point?\"\n\n\"Nope. But I had you fooled, didn't I?\" She gave me a resigned smile. \"I wish I was. You ever get that feeling? That it would just be that much easier to be born from humans? I like this world. I like the languages, the music, the people\u2026 having ground beneath my feet\u2026 I don't mind the never-ending gig hunt, or the nights I've had to sleep in my car. It's all worth it, in the end. No matter how rich or how powerful I might have gotten if I'd stayed.\"\n\n\"Stayed where?\"\n\n\"Where it's cold and dark, of course. Come on, take a guess. Humor me.\"\n\nI let go of a long breath and calmed the thoughts running through my head. \"You're from the ocean, aren't you?\" \n\nHer smile grew wide. \"And there you go. Now, I know that you think of me as\u2014\"\n\n\"Foolish?\"\n\n\"No, I meant\u2014\"\n\n\"Moronic?\"\n\n\"Just let me finish! I guess I am a little\u2026 a little bit of that, but back where I was born, I was the daughter of someone, uh. Big. Someone really special, actually. And I was, like, his super special baby daughter. But that's not the kind of life I wanted for myself, and when my Dad wouldn't let me go, I simply fled. That was years and *years* ago, but he hasn't stopped chasing me. He's always watching me, starting these sudden attacks trying to drag me back under\u2026 down the drain, down into the ocean\u2026 That's why I don't swim anymore.\"\n\n\"He could squeeze you through a drain?\"\n\n\"Don't be ignorant, Eva. My body works different. You should be able to relate, what with the extra limbs popping out,\" she argued, crossing her arms a bit defensively. \n\n\"Hey, I was just curious.\"\n\n\"Right, I-I'm sorry. Okay, so\u2026 I ended up here and that's where we are now,\" she concluded. \"You might be wondering why I don't simply move out into the desert or whatever, but I actually can't stay far away from the ocean for too long. I just\u2026 it's like I get sick when I'm not close enough.\"\n\n\"I think I understand.\"\n\n\"Of course you do, and I appreciate it. But all the more, I appreciate what you've been doing for me.\"\n\n\"At my own expense. As per usual with you,\" I grunted.\n\n\"I'm sorry! I'm just\u2026 my mind is all over the place sometimes.\"\n\n\"And you seriously blame me for calling you thoughtless?\" I inquired.\n\nShe huffed, ignoring the question. \"Anyways, this is what I'm dealing with when I'm not around. Everytime I feel them getting a little too calculated, a little too close, I try to lose them. You know, shake them off. And I know it would be way, way safer to stay on the run, but I like this life I'm having. Even if it's selfish, I don't wanna go. Except I might have to. The occasional shower crab is one thing, but what happened at the concert\u2026 that was one of the humanoid deep ones targeting the people who are dear to me, a-and that's\u2014like, if it's you, you can always defend yourself, even if it's a tough spot maybe. And Nettie handled herself well, too, but there's a way higher risk.\"\n\n\"I know. I get it. But that doesn't mean you should have to flee from here,\" I argued. \n\nKit smiled wanly. \"You sure?\"\n\n\"Yes. And for what it's worth, if you stay close, then I'll do everything I can to protect you. The same goes and always will go for the others, as well.\"\n\n\"I don't know. I don't wanna dump that kind of responsibility on you. I don't want to make you my bodyguard,\" she muttered, scratching the shaved side of her head.\n\n\"You're not *making* me do anything. I'm offering,\" I corrected her. \"Tell me who or what to watch out for with those humanoids.\"\n\nKit nodded eagerly. \"Blue hair! Humans don't naturally come with that. My people do. Oh, and split ears and wet clothes. Of course, those aren't actually one hundred percent reliable signs, but they might be. And that language I was speaking, that's *Adma'ai*. Only the deep ones can understand it. If you hear something like that, it has to be one of us talking. I-I don't know how else to\u2014\"\n\n\"I got it.\" I rose from my seat. \"Go clean up the bathroom.\"\n\nI proceeded to sit down in my room and *think*. It's almost hard to believe how much weird crap has been going on lately. I believe it can be divided into three categories: weird crap happening around Frankie (no, I have not forgotten about that), weird crap happening around Kit (which I'm getting closer to shedding light on) and weird crap happening randomly, like the warehouse-incident or my \"dimension-hopping\", as the waiter called it. I have this feeling that this will add up to something bigger in the end, and I also have a feeling that I won't like the result. \n\n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13dr5g0/help_im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[2: deadbeat roommate](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13eovqy/im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_also_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[3: creepy crush](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13fnc4u/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_everyone/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[4: relocation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13gjpwd/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_does_anybody/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[5: beach concert](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13heih5/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[6: First date](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ib2es/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_my_first/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[7: Temp work](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ja7jx/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_temp_work/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[9: dismal worldview](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13l69a9/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_the_world/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

You and Frankie still need to learn more about each other too, are you nervous to ask him? I would think he would be ok sharing some personal info with another non-human he can trust.    \n\nI figured Kit was a Siren, but it sounds like it's not that simple. Her mentions of the Deep Ones are very intriguing! I'm guessing that, uh, thing with your mouth tearing sealed up afterwards?",

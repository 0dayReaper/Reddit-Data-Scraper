    "postText": "I\u2019ve seen bodies mashed, crushed, dismembered, stuffed into suitcases, blackened like meat on a grill, floating, bloating, with flies swarming their flesh and maggots wriggling out of their eyes. I have, in short, an [intimacy with death.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/140khwa/i_went_on_a_cruise_and_all_the_passengers_were/)\n\nBut nothing prepared me for the horror in cabin 4044.\n\nI stared at my *own* smoldering corpse, into the blackened sockets of my melted eyes, and ice raked my spine and splintered my bones, shivering all the way down to my frozen fingertips.\n\n*You knew this day would come,* whispered a voice in my head. And then, as my nose wrinkled, *Ugh, I smell like bacon*.\n\nGiggles. Oh dear. Not beneficial. Couldn\u2019t I try to approach my death with some dignity? No? Well\u2026 fine. Ignoring my own bubbling hysteria, I held my napkin over my nostrils and leaned in. Cross-legged in a lotus position, hands cradled and thumbs touching, crispy me (hehe) held the pose of a meditating monk. From the liquor bottles scattered around the burnt wreckage as well as the pose, I\u2019d started the fire myself. But what induced such madn\u2014\n\nGlowing white light suddenly emanated from the blackened sockets. I gasped, tumbling backwards over the coffee table.\n\nWhen I sat up, the light was gone.\n\nIt did not reappear during the half hour I charged my phone, keeping one leery eye on my corpse while I used the ship\u2019s spotty wifi for research.\n\n**A Mysterious Contagion**\n\nAccording to Google, the worst cruise disaster in modern times involved the partial capsizing of a vessel after a captain\u2019s error led to a rock tearing open the hull. Of the four thousand passengers, 34 drowned.\n\nAnother ship infamously dubbed the \u201cpoop cruise\u201d had its engines catch fire, and passengers were stranded for nearly a week on board without electricity or toilet facilities.\n\nBut the Seastar was not destined for any ocean or weather related incident, but rather, a *contagion*. And while coronavirus and norovirus have both afflicted cruise ships in recent years, no virus\u2014not even rabies\u2014could explain the self-mutilation. To say nothing of the virulence. A mortality rate of 100%? That was unheard of in nature. There should be *some* survivors, if only by happenstance.\n\n*Or is it because\u2026*\n\nA terrible chill spread up the flesh of my arms, and a thought lodged like an ice pick in my skull: *What if the doom of the Azure Seastar isn\u2019t happenstance\u2014but deliberate? Are there no survivors because someone doesn\u2019t want there to be?*\n\nNumb at the implication, I set down my phone. But how? Why? A thousand passengers and crew\u2026 If there *was* someone planning such a disaster, how would I identify them? And why would anyone commit such an atrocity? My gut tightened, and I got up and ventured out to the upper decks.\n\n**Deck 9**\n\n*Cold. Cold. Cold.* The chill in my bones deepened with each hand I brushed. Passengers glared as I fumbled around, dismissing me as either blind or mentally feeble. The blindness was somewhat accurate\u2014I couldn\u2019t see under the electric lighting in the swanky interior, since my eyes were seeing six days in the future, when the Seastar would be plunged into blackout. I depended on my phone\u2019s feeble flashlight as I navigated the sea of guests around the bar and lounge areas. But no matter how many arms and hands I bumbled into\u2014*COLD!*\n\nWith no accidental survivors, I was becoming more and more convinced the Seastar\u2019s doom must be deliberate, but I was still very much in the dark\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014about why.\n\nThe most useful discovery of the evening came after my collision with a heavyset older man whose drink I spilled. Noticing me sweeping around my phone\u2019s pitiful beam and assuming I\u2019d lost something, he offered to lend me a more powerful flashlight from his cabin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those high powered ones if you want it.\u201d He smiled, and I stared, every hair on my neck standing on end.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026 Something on my face?\u201d His smile turned into a confused frown under my phone\u2019s light.\n\n\u201cN-no. Yes, a flashlight would be very helpful, thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis way. Name\u2019s John, by the way.\u201d His grin returned.\n\nOh God\u2014I\u2019d recognized him. Glass chewing man. He had a name now.\n\nI am ashamed to admit that I tried not to speak to him too much on the way to his cabin, despite his doing me a kindness. It\u2019s so much harder to face death with names and histories attached. I remained standing outside his cabin door, looking incredibly guilty as he emerged and set into my hand the flashlight. When I turned it on, it sent a floodlight straight down the corridor one end to the other. In addition to this useful tool, the encounter brought a critical insight.\n\nHis clothes. Glass chewing involved a different outfit. So, the catastrophe would not strike tonight.\n\n**Pool deck**\n\nAfter brushing roughly a billion *COLD* hands, as the overnight crowd began thinning, I took myself out to a lounger (being unwilling to overnight in my cabin wreathed in the fumes of my own chargrilled corpse).\n\nVoices woke me in the dead of night.\n\nThe moon and stars offered the only illumination over the pitch sea, and I shambled groggily to the rail. It struck me that the wind had died\u2014the Seastar was stationary.\n\nOut on the pale peaks of waves, a rescue craft bobbed up and down.\n\n\u201cLooks like some idiot went overboard,\u201d complained a voice behind me.\n\nA cluster of passengers had gathered. One\u2014with the authority of an experienced cruiser\u2014mentioned the possibility of a suicide jumper. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t affect our itinerary much,\u201d declared the man. \u201cThese things happen at sea, you know. After the rescue, he or she\u2014let\u2019s call them Passenger X\u2014will be taken to the infirmary and monitored by security\u2026\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t hear the rest of his words, because I was too busy smacking my forehead as I burst, \u201cThe *INFIRMARY*!\u201d Good fucking gracious, was my brain *already* barbecue? I suspected a contagion, yet hadn\u2019t thought to search the infirmary? Snatching up my flashlight, I headed downstairs, but the lower decks were cordoned off.\n\nA jovial crewman explained that passenger access was restricted during rescue operations.\n\n\u201cAlso, it\u2019s three in the morning,\u201d he added, sipping coffee from a styrofoam cup. \u201cThe infirmary will open\u2014I think around eight?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich deck?\u201d\n\n\u201cDeck two.\u201d He gladly explained the layout when I asked. The lower decks also included crew quarters, a crew lounge, mess hall, the engine room, kitchens, food storage, the \u201chighway\u201d used for quickly trafficking trolleys from one end of the ship to the other, the infirmary, various machinery rooms, a brig, a morgue\u2014\u201cWe mostly use it for like, chilling flowers and stuff like that though,\u201d he added with a grin. There was also a third staircase near the stern of the ship\u2014the aft stairwell\u2014used regularly only by staff but opened to passengers in cases of emergency.\n\nAs he rattled off this list, I could feel myself plunging deeper into despair. This ship was so enormous, and so much of what lay below was off limits to passengers. Furthermore, there were no windows below! How was I going to make my way in the blackout? Even with John\u2019s flashlight, the prospect was daunting.\n\n*But first things first, Cass*, I told myself. The infirmary.\n\n**Infirmary**\n\nAt 8am sharp I stepped into the infirmary. The waiting room was as ordinary as they come, complete with boring magazines and cheap office chairs and\u2014because it was deep in the interior\u2014pitch dark to my sleep-deprived eyes.\n\n\u201cMorning, Sweetie! How can I help you today?\u201d The secretary at the front desk tipped her head toward me, revealing a glimpse of another face beneath my flashlight\u2014mouth gaping and mangled, every tooth pulled out. Blissfully unaware that she was sharing her chair with her own corpse, the secretary smiled and gave me a clipboard of paperwork for check in.\n\nWhile I filled out the forms by flashlight, footsteps shuffled near the desk, and the secretary struck up a conversation with someone I assumed was a nurse. My ears pricked when they gossiped about last night.\n\n\u201c\u2026 did you hear about the rescue? When they pulled him out of the water, he wasn\u2019t breathing...\u201d\n\nI pretended to be engrossed in the forms.\n\n\u201c\u2026 As soon as they revived him, he started screaming and screaming.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my god\u2026 seriously?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, and he was like, super aggressive. They had to sedate him.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my god\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really weird\u2026 they\u2019re saying he might have come from another ship, and it might\u2019ve been, like\u2026 days\u2026 that he was out on the water!\u201d\n\nSo this Passenger X who was pulled in last night had just been drifting out on the ocean? He *wasn\u2019t* a jumper? And he was \u201cscreaming and screaming\u201d\u2014like, perhaps, someone maddened? I was about to abandon my forms and search for this Passenger X when the secretary all but gave me a heart attack by materializing in front of me out of the dark. She took the paperwork and informed me the nurse was ready. I was directed to a small examination room\u2014one of three, I noted as I swept my beam around the infirmary. Examining tables, chairs, computers. No sign of any screaming passenger. Where would they have brought him?\n\nThe nurse, a young woman in a hijab, asked me the typical questions, typing my responses into a computer with a cracked, dead screen.\n\n\u201cIs he all right? The man who was rescued?\u201d I asked. \u201cWas he drifting long?\u201d\n\nShe responded pertly, \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to ascertain. But don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s being helped\u2014um\u2026.\u201d Her brow scrunched as she shone a light into each of my eyes.\n\nOf course. I forgot to warn her.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so strange\u2026\u201d she murmured. \u201cAre you wearing contact lenses?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. My eyes are very black. Even under a flashlight they don\u2019t reflect any light. They\u2019ve been that way since I was four years old. I was dead for nearly an hour from drowning, but revived, and everything came back normal except for my eyes.\u201d I\u2019d always believed my horrific visions were the result of my near-death experience, as if I wasn\u2019t supposed to come back, and brought a little bit of death with me, just in my eyes.\n\n\u201cWow! What a wild story!\u201d The nurse exclaimed.\n\n\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d I replied, looking at her corpse peering out at me from under the examination table, all jammed around the base.\n\nA knock on the door cut our exam short before I could warn her (not that it would make any difference). She asked me to wait for a few moments and stepped out.\n\nWhen she did not immediately return, I slipped away in search of Passenger X.\n\n**Highway**\n\nThe moment I stepped out of the infirmary and away from the nearby elevator lounge, it became evident I\u2019d left the passenger areas. All veneer of luxury was stripped away, leaving bare walls interrupted only by occasional stacks of boxes. The flashlight\u2019s wide beam swept along the massive corridor that I was guessing was the \u201chighway.\u201d My footsteps resounded on concrete. Nothing but sterile, windowless white\u2014or at least it had been white, once.\n\nI tried not to look too closely at the crimson streaking the walls or the corpses I stepped over. The origin of the contagion was definitely down *here*. Even through the napkin held over my nose, I could taste death here\u2014\n\nHello? What was this?\n\nIn one section of the corridor, the walls and floor had *rippled*. Almost as if a shockwave had left indentations, bending and shattering the concrete. But what could have done that?\n\nThe lights flickered.\n\nI froze.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t my flashlight\u2019s beam. That remained steady. The lights\u2014the *overhead lights*\u2014flickered, casting the hall in blinking flashes of crimson streaks and white walls.\n\nThen the lights came *on.*\n\nAll the bodies vanished.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said, blinking against the sudden brightness. \u201c*Oh*.\u201d The smell was gone, too. No scent of death. Though there was something else. A strangely metallic, tangy smell. Like lightning and copper.\n\nI shut off my flashlight, turning a slow circle as I gawked at the stark white walls, the flat gray floor, the dazzling fluorescent lighting so bright it almost blinded me. It struck me that I was seeing the ship *right now.* Not six days in the future, but *NOW*, before the blackout, before the outbreak. The same whitewashed hallway as all the other passengers saw.\n\nWhy? What had happened to my vision? Had I lost my special sight? Or\u2014\n\nSomeone was standing in the corridor.\n\nI froze.\n\nThe hairs on my neck prickled, and a knot of dread twisted my gut.\n\nThe man stood halfway down the highway, slouched and bedraggled. His clothes were crushed and faded, hanging off him like from hangers of bone. His limp hair draped in messy curls around his unshaven face. And his eyes\u2014those eyes! The same eyes I\u2019d seen looking at me from the deep end of a public swimming pool when I was just a child. The same eyes I\u2019d seen staring emptily from John\u2019s glass-chewing corpse, and from the mangled nurse under the table. All the dead have the exact same look in their eyes. One glance at those pale blue orbs\u2014\n\nThis man was *dead.* I was certain of it.\n\nYet he was standing.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2026 are you the passenger who\u2014\u201d\n\nThe dead man\u2019s lips spread, baring teeth in what might have been a sick imitation of a grin, or a grimace.\n\n\u201c*HEY!!!*\u201d\n\nI jumped as a voice called out behind me.\n\nAn officer in a security uniform strode out from an unmarked door, eyes on the dead man. The security officer said, \u201cMa\u2019am, stay back.\u201d His gaze never left the dead man. \u201cSir, if you could please come with me\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d I cried. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d\n\nBut the security officer was already marching forward, and the dead man\u2019s hands lifted in stiff parody of surrender. He turned and began shuffling away under the officer\u2019s escort. And then\u2014his teeth bared. Suddenly the dead man had his arm around the officer, mouth clamping on his ear as the officer howled. He was *eating* him\u2014no, tongue wriggling\u2014licking him?\n\n\u2014whispering?\n\nThe officer shoved the dead man aside and collapsed against the wall. I rushed forward, but skidded to a halt as the dead man\u2019s grinning face turned toward me. Terror seized me at the sudden revelation that I was next. He took a wobbly step\u2014\n\nThe lights shut off.\n\nSwearing, I fumbled for my flashlight. Switched on the beam. Shrieked when it fell across a hand\u2014but it was just the security officer reaching for me, asking, \u201cHey\u2014hey, are you all right, Ma\u2019am?\u201d He winced, rubbing at his ear like a dog bothered by a whistle only it could hear. Then he said into his phone, \u201cHe assaulted me and got away. I\u2019ve got another passenger here\u2014\u201d\n\nThe stench wafted back. Gore once again splattered the walls. I was once more seeing six days into the future, and clapped my napkin to my mouth to stop myself from retching at the return of the smell. But I wasn\u2019t really thinking about all that.\n\nNo, because my heart slammed my ribs and my breath ripped ragged from my throat, and every hair stood on end as if I\u2019d been struck by lightning. Whatever it was the crew of the Seastar had hauled from the ocean, it certainly hadn\u2019t been living when they \u201crescued\u201d it. And the proof was in those overhead lights. Merely being in proximity to Passenger X, my vision had been pulled into the present. Like he was a magnet drawing my sight into his field. But if death was the thing my black, lightless eyes usually glimpsed, then what exactly *was* Passenger X? And if he could affect my vision, not to mention animating a dead man\u2019s corpse\u2026 how was I going to have any hope of [stopping him?](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)\n\n[\\[Part 1\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/140khwa/i_went_on_a_cruise_and_all_the_passengers_were/) [\\[Part 2\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/142z4tp/i_went_on_a_cruise_and_found_the_source_of_the/)",

Unreliable narrators are definitely a thing, after all. What makes me suspect that here is what she actually said was (emphasis added):!&lt;\n\n&gt;\"No survivors. No witnesses.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Well\u2026 one witness\u2026\"!&lt;\n\n&gt;!She makes exception for herself as a witness, but not as a survivor. Could be a red herring, of course. She also says (emphasis added again):!&lt;\n\n&gt;&gt;!I sleep with the lights on. I never enter darkened hallways or stairwells. And I do not ever shake hands. Although I\u2019ve always had some quirks (the handshake one is an old habit), most of these are fresh, a consequence of my time aboard that doomed cruise ship.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Obviously these refer to post-cruise, present tense. I think it's possible they may also be red herrings, though. First, from the author's own recounting, shaking hands was not a thing they did prior to the cruise; although not explicitly stated, she clearly already shied away from physical contact. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Another potential hint is in the name she's chosen for herself - Cassandra. A figure from Greek mythology, Cassandra did see future calamities before they occurred - the last of which was her own death, and as with all the ones before, she was helpless to prevent it.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The circumstances thus far known of her death strike me as well. Most everyone else on the ship appears to have died in the throes of some Birdbox/The Happening/Kingsman style mayhem and madness scene, and in the middle of all that, she just lays down in her own bed and self-immolates? I don't think so. I think it's much more likely that she survives everything else, writes her story down (an act of testimony which renders her a witness even after her own death), and then falls asleep smoking in bed with an open bottle at her side. She'd be far from the first alcoholic to do so.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Of course I may be wrong about all of it. This is all just speculation, and none of what I picked up on may mean anything at all, or maybe it was intended to mean something else. Either way, I'm definitely interested in seeing the next installment!&lt;",

All I know is, I slowly became aware that I was awake again. For a few moments, my mind was muddled, thoughts coming to me slowly as if they were slogging through waist high mud. I tried as hard as I could to recall what had happened before I fell asleep. *Did I drink too much again and pass out in the hotel room chair?*\r  \n\r  \nAnd then, like a semi truck smashing into me at seventy miles an hour, everything came flooding back, snapping me fully awake. I remembered where, and more precisely, *when* we were. I remembered the events of the two weeks. I remembered being attacked in the elevator by the bellhop who\u2019d appeared out of nowhere, remembered Paula and I rushing to what we thought was the safety of our hotel room. And\u2026I remembered the phone call I\u2019d made. The sinister, sadistic voice of Arthur mocking me on the other end, before the room had filled with some sort of gas and causing us to fall unconscious.\r  \n\r  \nAs my vision returned to me, I also became aware that I was no longer in the hotel room. The dark, drab grey concrete wall standing opposite me, combined with the faint sound of water dripping somewhere gave me the idea that I was underground somewhere. *Maybe a basement or something*. I also became aware that I couldn\u2019t move anything except for my head. Glancing down, I saw I was tied with rather thick rope to some kind of metal chair. One which had its back to another. *Paula!* I twisted my neck around as far as it could go, my eyes locking on my wife\u2019s unmistakable blonde hair. Like me, she, too, was tied to the chair she had been sat in. Her head slumped forward, showing that she was still unconscious. *Well, at least thank God she\u2019s not dead*, I thought. The thought brought me a momentary feeling of relief.\r  \n\r  \nWhich was then shattered by the voice which spoke up, coming from somewhere off to my left. \u201cAh, good, you\u2019re finally awake, Daniel!\u201d I spun my head the other way, and was immediately blinded by the bright light which snapped on. I jammed my eyes shut, wincing at the sudden ache in my temples. \u201cHenry, you idiot, you blinded our poor guest here!\u201d the voice snapped, \u201cLower the brightness a bit, will ya?\u201d The light became less intense, and after opening my eyes and blinking away the blue spots in my vision, I saw them. There had to be at least five or six figures standing just behind the light, one which looked to be an old style construction spotlight. I also saw something which sent a lightning bolt of horror through me. The floor had what looked like dried bloodstains on it. *Oh, shit*. Behind me, I heard a groan, indicating that Paula was beginning to wake up. \u201cAnd it seems your wife is coming round as well. What truly excellent timing, indeed!\u201d\r  \n\r  \nSomething inside my mind clicked, and I realized that I recognized the voice. \u201cArthur\u201d I said simply, not phrasing it as a question, but more a statement. The sound of clapping came from behind the light, and one figure stepped in front of it. As my eyes adjusted, I saw he was still wearing his hotel uniform, though the warm, friendly smile I\u2019d become well acquainted with was long gone. In its place, he wore a smile which gave a literal meaning to the phrase *skin-crawling*. \u201cVery good, Daniel!\u201d he said, before turning towards my wife, who was now struggling in an attempt to free herself. \u201cAnd welcome back to the land of the living to you as well, Mrs. Clements!\u201d Instantly, I felt her go still behind me. \u201c\u2026Where are we?\u201d I heard her ask, her voice shaking slightly. Arthur let loose another eerie smile. \u201cWe\u2019re in the basement of *The Dunes*, my dear\u201d he answered, looking back at me and flashing a truly wicked smile, \u201cAnd, for the record, don\u2019t get the idea to try and scream for help. This section of the basement is soundproof, so nobody in the rest of the basement will hear you\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat the *fuck* do you want with us?\u201d I demanded, glaring at the man, \u201cAnd more to the point, how the *hell* did you know we\u2019re from the future?\u201d I heard Paula let out a gasp behind me; since she\u2019d passed out, I never had gotten a chance to tell her what had been said to me over the phone\u201d Arthur let out a low chuckle, then gestured behind him at the shadowy figures behind the light. \u201cI suppose I *should* explain that, shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d he said as another figure brought him a chair to sit in. As the figure turned away, I saw the sneering face of the bellhop who'd attacked us. Arthur took a few steps forward before placing the chair down and taking a seat in it. After a moment of getting comfortable, he began to speak.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2019ve worked at this hotel and casino the entire time it\u2019s been here. I was personally asked to help run the day to day business on the hotel side by my boss and his group. And not long after we fully opened seven years ago, we began to notice, well, shall we say, *odd* individuals show up from time to time. At first, we didn\u2019t know what to make of them, assuming they were simply being visited by peculiar men and women who had their own way to dress and speak. They had large amounts of money, and it helped us during the rough months, so we never thought to look beyond that\u201d\r  \nHe stood up and began to pace around us, circling us in almost the same manner a shark would circle a wounded fish or seal. \u201cThat *was*, until one of the casino pit bosses caught one of them attempting to count cards at blackjack. Much like you two, we brought him down here, to a place we wouldn\u2019t be disturbed. He wouldn\u2019t speak at first, as all of them tend to do, but, well\u201d he let out a truly sinister snicker which made me shudder, \u201c*Everyone* has their limit of pain where they break. And *that*? That, is when we learned the truth. He said he was a time traveler, someone from far in the future who\u2019d come back to visit here. He even told us where his machine was, up in his room. Of course, we didn\u2019t believe him at the time, and when I phoned Mr. Patriarca to ask about what should be done with him, well-\u201c he drew his thumb across his throat, mimicking someone\u2019s throat being cut, \u201cWe got rid of him\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cPatriarca\u201d I mumbled, my brain whirring into gear as old memories from growing up on the east coast began flying through my brain and connected with the name. \u201cI\u2019m, sorry, did you say something?\u201d Arthur asked, stopping his infernal circling and leaning towards me. I looked up at him, locking eyes with him. \u201cRaymond Patriarca\u201d I said slowly, then chuckled and shook my head, \u201cThe Patriarca crime family\u201d A genuinely surprised look came over Arthur\u2019s face. \u201cYou *know* about Mr. Patriarca and the family?\u201d he asked. I nodded. \u201cI grew up on the east coast. His name is *still* infamous in those parts, even decades after his death. And I was always a bit of a history buff\u201d A smile, not a mocking one, but almost the same genuine style I\u2019d seen when first arriving spread across his face, and he reached out and patted me on the shoulder a few times. \u201cWell, for the first time ever, I\u2019m surprised by something someone from the 21st Century said to me\u201d he said happily, \u201cI was wrong about my initial impression of you, Daniel. Please accept my apologies for my insult earlier. It\u2019s truly an honor to know the family ends up being burned into history. That Mr. Patriarca does as well\u201d He sighed and stood back up. \u201cThat makes it doubly a shame about what\u2019s going to happen to you\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAnyways, back to what I was saying\u201d he said, beginning to circle us again, \u201cAfter we dealt with him, I was personally tasked with going up and getting rid of the man\u2019s luggage. I was in the middle of doing so, when something small and silver fell out of his suitcase. I remember picking it up out of sheer curiosity, stepping out of the room. For the hell of it, I slipped it into my pocket and disposed of the rest of his belongings, keeping his cash to send back to the boss. I went out for a smoke after everything wound down, stepping out front, and started messing with it. All of a sudden, a bright white light flashed all around me, and when it disappeared, I was still outside. But *The Dunes*? It was gone. I was still standing in front of a building. But it was one I\u2019d never seen before. It had the name\u2026\u201d he trailed off for a moment, scrunching up his face as he remembered, \u201c\u2026*Bellagio*\u201d He stopped circling again, sitting back down in the chair and looking back and forth at me and my wife.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI saw strange, futuristic looking cars driving along the strip. Everything looked different. Everything looked\u2026*different*. That was when I looked up at the sign out front, with the same name as on the building. And saw the date on the sign. 2027. And then I knew. The man had been telling us the truth\u201d He leaned back in the chair, laughing, almost at the mental absurdity of it all. \u201cAfter that, I frantically began hitting the buttons on the silver device again, and thankfully, the white light appeared again, and I was back in front of The Dunes. I was going to make a call to Mr. Patriarca, to tell him about the truth, when something stopped me. Something inside me, told me to keep it to myself. Because now, I was the one with all the power. More power than any amount of money my boss ever could have, and I say that with all due respect to him. So, I decided to wait a while\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThat was when more of the strange looking and speaking people began to show up. Some, I could tell, were like the man we took care of. Time travelers. Something straight out of an H.G. Wells novel. Others, though. Others looked to be also from the future, but just, not as futuristic seeming as the others. And that\u2019s when I learned something. And I actually learned it from another of the time travelers we captured, a woman. The last one we captured, actually. You see, when people from the future travel back to any point in time, they apparently can accidentally create something which the woman called, a time slip. I\u2019m not exactly sure what it is, but apparently, it can accidentally suck people from any point in time back to when the person using their device goes\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAnd *that* is when I had the great idea. You see, the rest of the outfit out here-\u201c he gestured to the figures behind the light, who all waved at us and laughed, \u201c-we like to have a little *fun* with people. Always have. It\u2019s just a sort of appetite\u201d He let loose the most sadistic, evil grin I\u2019d ever seen him give, and I shuddered, knowing full well what he meant by *that*. \u201cBut, we don\u2019t want to draw attention to ourselves. We don\u2019t want to ruin the operation the boss has a stake in out here, and if too many people from here, now, begin to disappear, it\u2019ll draw too much heat on us. Likewise, if we make too many of the people who seem to deliberately time travel here disappear, it\u2019ll also ruin things. So, we developed a system. You see, the device seems to be connected to others, as it\u2019ll give a warning when someone travels here. That\u2019s when we keep our eyes peeled. Because, more times than not, it\u2019ll accidentally catch someone from a different time, be it the early 21st Century, or farther along. And they\u2019ll wind up here, confused and searching for a place to stay. Just like you two did\u201d\r  \n\r  \nHe stood up again, now giving us both a shark like grin. \u201cAnd that allows us two things. It gives us a chance to get money, and futuristic technology to hold onto. And secondly?\u201d The shark like grin widened, \u201cWell, unfortunately for you two, you\u2019re about to learn how we like to keep ourselves sharp when it comes to, well, let\u2019s just say, the techniques you probably have heard about us having. And no one will ever know, because, here, in 1962, you don\u2019t exist yet. And in your time? You\u2019ll just simply have vanished. Like all the others before you have\u201d\r  \n\r  \nHis speech finally finished, he stood as tall as he could, grinning at us and waiting for our reactions. There was a long stretch of silence. \u201cWhat about that dark, abandoned version of the hotel I found myself in?\u201d I finally asked. He shrugged. \u201cA little bit of future technology we swiped from the woman\u201d he said simply. \u201cAnd the cameras?\u201d I asked, \u201cThe ones I saw recording me as I ran?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cWell, we like to replay our interactions with our favorite guests for entertainment. It started with that little scare you had in the parking lot that first night\u201d He pointed at one man, \u201cHenry had fun with you that night. *And*, if a discerning buyer on the black market wants a film of that style, we\u2019re happy to oblige.\r  \n\r  \n \u201cYou\u2019re all fucking *evil*\u201d Paula spat out behind me, \u201cYou\u2019re all sadistic bastards\u201d. Almost as one, Arthur and the others began to laugh. \u201cMy dear, you do flatter us\u201d Arthur said, wiping away tears from his eyes. I felt my temper flame. \u201cFucking simpletons\u201d I hissed under my breath. Almost at once, everyone went silent. Arthur took a few steps until he stood in front of me. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d he asked, his voice flat and emotionless. \u201cYou fucking heard me, dumbass\u201d I growled at him, \u201cYou think you really scare me just because you\u2019re part of the mafia? I grew up around people far worse than you. Perks of having a single father who was a prison guard, who had to take his son along with him to work\u201d I shifted my gaze between him and the shadowy forms of the others. \u201c*You* insinuated that *I* was dumb on the phone? Clearly, *you* and your people are not the cream of the crop when it comes to 20th Century intelligence. All you are, is a bunch of muscle bound Neanderthals, who accidentally stumbled across something you could never have the brains to create in a million years\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNo fucking wonder the mob ended up dying out\u201d It was my turn to grin. I knew full well that the situation we were in was one we likely weren\u2019t getting out of. I\u2019d attempted to loosen the knots in the rope during the man\u2019s speech, but they were done far too well and tight to wiggle out of. My mind flooded back to the tortures I remembered hearing the mob performing, and every fiber of my being trembled with fear at the knowledge that we were about to endure them ourselves. But if both of us were going to die, I was going to use my tongue to give them some mental and emotional barbs to remember us by, long after we were gone. \u201cAnd, for the record? Your oh-so revered boss? Is now relentlessly mocked in my time for dying a frail old man of a heart attack. What a gigantic fall from grace\u201d I now gave my own version of Arthur\u2019s shark like grin. \u201cTime passing by\u2019s a *bitch*, ain\u2019t it?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nInstantly, I knew I\u2019d hit a nerve. The emotionless mask Arthur had put on his face melded away, replaced by one of absolute rage. Then, it melted away, replaced with the evil grin he\u2019d worn all the while. \u201cWell, Daniel, I\u2019d originally been thinking about making it rather quick for you after you\u2019d impressed me. You, *and* your lovely wife. But, after that insult, I think we\u2019re going to take our time with you\u201d His face went emotionless again. \u201c*Both* of you\u201d I felt the blood drain from my face. While I was certain we both were going to die, I\u2019d hoped, in addition to stinging the man with the truth about the leader of his crime family, that whatever torturous death they had in store for us, I\u2019d take most of it off my wife and project it onto me. But in hindsight, it was almost a certainty that others had attempted to bait him. The man wasn\u2019t an idiot. Arthur pointed at the group of men behind the light. \u201cEveryone follow me to the storage closet. I have a particularly fun demise for these two we\u2019ll all be able to take part in\u201d he said, then pointed at the shape of one man, \u201cExcept you. You stay and watch them. We\u2019ll be back in less than ten minutes\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAnd with that, he stepped back behind the light and walked away, his goons following after him. After a minute or so, I heard Paula let out a sigh behind me. \u201cYou have any sort of plan, Danny?\u201d she asked softly. I snorted. \u201cI wish I did\u201d I admitted, \u201cI\u2019m trying to think of anything, but nothing\u2019s coming to me\u201d She sighed again, and then I felt the tips of her fingers brush mine. \u201cDanny\u2026if this is the last bit of time we\u2019re going to share on this earth, I just want you to know, I love you so damn much. However this ends, meeting you was the best thing to ever happen to me. So, thank you. For everything\u201d Tears formed in my eyes at her words. \u201cI love you, too, sweetheart\u201d I managed out. I was about to say more when I suddenly became aware of the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps. The lone remaining figure behind the light turned as someone else entered the room and spoke. \u201cHey, Mikey, Arthur sent for me to get you. Apparently he lost his set of keys, and you\u2019re the only one with access to the backup set. He wants you to go get them and bring them to him at the storage room\u201d The other man cursed, then hooked a thumb at us. \u201cDo me a favor and watch these two, then, okay?\u201d \u201cCan do\u201d the newcomer said, and the first man rushed out of the room.\r  \n\r  \nThe sound of the man\u2019s departing footsteps disappeared. For a few more seconds, there was silence, and then the new man stepped into the light. My eyes widened slightly as I recognized the young man who\u2019d operated the elevators for us the entire time we\u2019d stayed in *The Dunes*. He stood for a minute, staring at us, then looked behind him at the open door. Seemingly satisfied with something, he pulled something out from his pocket. I shrank back a bit when I saw the metal blade of a folding knife appear. But then he rushed to us and knelt down. I felt an odd sensation and suddenly realized what he was doing. *He\u2019s sawing through the ropes*. The man looked at me. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t have time to explain right now, but I honestly can\u2019t stand the things Arthur does to people anymore. So I\u2019m going to try and help you both get out of here\u201d A corner of his mouth pulled up in a half smile, \u201cPlus, I kind\u2019ve got paid a lot of money by someone to make sure you stay okay\u201d\r  \n\r  \nMy mind raced as I felt the ropes loosen and fall away from my wrists. A moment later, the ones binding my ankles to the chair give way and stood up, trying to get some feeling into my legs. The man freed Paula a few moments after, and she stood up, rushing to me and embracing me with an almost ribcage crushing hug and kiss. But there wasn\u2019t much time to do more. \u201cHurry, follow me\u201d the man said, and then moved to the open doorway. The two of us quickly followed him. He stared out into the gloomy hallway, then motioned for us to follow him. My heart beat hard in my chest as I stepped out into the stone hall after him. I felt Paula\u2019s hand on my shoulder as she followed close behind. We stayed as silent as we could, moving from one drab hallway to the next. As we drew close to a t-junction, I heard the sound of a group of men\u2019s voices approaching, laughing and talking excitedly. \u201cIn here\u201d the man said, opening a door to what looked like a small office. We all flew inside, and the man closed the door, leaving only a hair crack open.\r  \n\r  \nThe voices grew louder, and I recognized Arthur\u2019s voice speaking over all the rest of them. \u201cNow, now, gentlemen, don\u2019t argue about who gets to go first. Remember, we\u2019re *all* going to have a turn with these on both of them. And you\u2019ll each get to take a souvenir to remember our fun by\u201d Another man spoke up. \u201cI call dibs on the man\u2019s wedding ring. That thing looks nice!\u201d A third man spoke up. \u201cThen *I* call dibs on the woman\u2019s ring. It\u2019d be something I\u2019d love to give my wife for an anniversary present!\u201d I shuddered a bit in the dark. *They\u2019re not only fighting for who gets to torture us first, but fighting with each other over who gets to strip things from our bodies like they\u2019re a flock of vultures*. Despite all the terrifying and horrible things we\u2019d been through so far, hearing that was perhaps one of the most soul destroying and horrifying. The voices again grew distant as they moved down the hallway. \u201cWe have to hurry, they\u2019ll realize you\u2019re gone in about three or four minutes\u201d our rescuer whispered, then opened the door again and led the way back out into the hall.\r  \n\r  \nThe hallways changed, from stone sided and cold, back to the industrial style that places such as hotels and restaurants were known for. The man now walked upright, striding quickly along as he guided us past an industrial laundry room and group of women folding sheets and towels. As we turned another corner, I almost let out a massive sigh of relief as I saw the metal doors of an elevator at the end of the hall. The man turned to us as he reached the doors and slapped the button to call it. \u201cOkay, now look, I\u2019ve taken all your things from your room and put them in your car outside; I was supposed to get rid of both of them, so they didn\u2019t care what I was doing\u201d He held his hand out, and I saw he was holding the keys to my BMW in them. I took them and held them in my own hand, then looked back up at him. \u201cThey\u2019ll kill you for doing this, you know\u201d I said.\r  \n \r  \nHe let out a small chuckle as the elevator dinged, announcing its arrival. \u201cThey would\u2019ve tried killing me anyways, since I called and let Mr. Patriarca know personally what his supposedly loyal men were withholding from him. He\u2019s already sent a lot of muscle to deal with Arthur and the others. Besides-\u201c he looked down at his feet, \u201cI don\u2019t think I could live with myself if I let another innocent person die at their hands\u201d \r  \n\r  \nPaula reached out and put a hand on the man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThank you\u201d she said simply, and the man nodded. He was about to say something else when the sound of thundering footsteps came from the way we\u2019d come. \u201cHurry, into the elevator!\u201d the man said urgently, and pushed us inside. He stepped inside himself and slammed the button for the lobby. Just as the doors began to close, I saw the red, furious face of Arthur come around the corner. He held a pistol in his hands and aimed it at the elevator. \u201cJimmy, you *fucking* traitor!\u201d he yelled, and squeezed off two or three shots. But the doors had already shut. I heard the sound of the bullets slamming into the other side of them. The elevator rose quickly. As I fought to catch my breath, I turned to the man-Jimmy. \u201cBy the way, very quickly, who paid you to watch out for us?\u201d I asked. The man chuckled. \u201cLet\u2019s just say, she loved having you and your wife at her performances, and got concerned when you told her to not forget you\u201d The realization flashed through my mind, and I let out a soft chuckle. *God bless you, Diana*. I saw the same realization cross my wife\u2019s face, and a similar smile crossed her face.\r  \n\r  \nBut then they faded as the doors opened, presenting us the empty elevator lobby. \u201cCome on, they\u2019ll be up here in a moment!\u201d Jimmy said, running for the main lobby. We followed close behind. As we ran, we passed a few guests who gave us puzzled looks. The main lobby, its check in desk now vacant with a gold sign stating *We\u2019ve temporarily stepped out! Be back shortly!* standing off to the side. As we ran into the entrance hallway, I heard the sound of a door slamming open, followed by men shouting. *Shit, here they come!* Jimmy slammed his shoulder into the entrance doors, allowing Paula and I to rush out onto the entrance steps. Just as he\u2019d said, the BMW sat in almost the exact same place it had when we\u2019d arrived, what seemed like a lifetime ago.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cJust drive back out the way you came in!\u201d Jimmy yelled at us, \u201cIf I\u2019ve worked it right, you\u2019ll make it back to wherever you came from!\u201d Paula turned to look at him. \u201cCome with us!\u201d she urged. But Jimmy shook his head. \u201cWhere you\u2019re from, isn\u2019t a place for me. Besides, I have to hold them off long enough for you to escape\u201d he shot a look over his shoulder as the yelling voices drew nearer, then back at us, \u201cNow GO!\u201d He screamed the final two words at us before shutting the entrance door. I saw him reach up and lock them. \u201cCome on!\u201d I shouted at Paula, then ran for my car. Sliding across the hood like some action movie hero, but feeling more like a character in a horror movie, I yanked open the driver\u2019s door and crashed into the seat. I saw my wife do the same. As I jammed the key into the ignition and twisted it, I shot one final look through the glass doors. Arthur and his men had already reached them. I saw many of them grabbing onto Jimmy, while others struggled to unlock the doors. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cDrive, Danny!\u201d Paula shouted at me, and I yanked the gearshift down into drive, stomping my foot down onto the accelerator. The rear tires squealed, and the car shot out from under the entrance awning. In the rear view mirror, I saw the men finally stumble outside. And then, we were skidding out onto the main road. I kept my foot hard down as the bright lights of the casinos flashed by us on all sides in a neon blur. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Paula suddenly twist around in her seat. \u201cOh, shit, they\u2019re coming after us!\u201d Shooting a look in the rear view mirror, I saw a pair of headlights rapidly approaching behind. \u201cDamn it\u201d I hissed, looking down at the speedometer. We were doing at least ninety miles an hour. Something suddenly rang out, a sound I couldn\u2019t place at first. Then it came again, and I realized what it was. \u201cThey\u2019re shooting at us!\u201d I yelled. \u201cJust keep going!\u201d Paula shouted back.\r  \n \r  \nIn the distance ahead, I saw the neon sign welcoming us to Vegas. *I\u2019ve just gotta make it there!* I kept repeating it as the pursuing car drew closer and closer. The sign rapidly approached us. In the rear view mirror, I saw the mask of animalistic rage and bloodlust on Arthur\u2019s face as he sat in the passenger seat of the car behind us. A moment later, I felt the impact as it slammed into us. The rear of the BMW broke loose for a moment, sliding to one side slightly, and I fought to regain control. *God, please do NOT let us die like this!* I screamed inside my mind. I felt us get bumped from behind again, and a new wave of horror shot through me at the prospect this could all be over in a matter of seconds.\r  \n\r  \nThat\u2019s when a bright, white light suddenly flashed in front of us. \u201cJeezum Crow!\u201d I shouted, jamming my eyes shut against the blinding flash. For a few seconds, I could see the bright light behind my closed eyelids. Then, it slowly faded. After a moment, I opened my eyes again. Blinking rapidly, I looked in the rear view mirror, expecting Arthur and his gang to still be hot on our heels. But nobody was behind us. Nobody was in front of us, either. All I saw was the black tarmac stretching out and away from us. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I heard Paula say quietly in the passenger seat. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know\u201d I managed out. Easing off the gas, I slowly brought the car over to the breakdown lane until it came to a stop. Keeping my foot on the brake and the car in drive, I leaned back in the seat. I looked at her. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened-\u201c I stopped, then looked at her again. \u201cWait, remember. Remember what Arthur said. When a bright flash of light happened, he suddenly found himself in the 21st Century\u201d Her jaw dropped open as my words registered. \u201cDoes- does that mean we\u2019re\u2026back?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI shook my head. I didn\u2019t know. *For all I know, it\u2019s a freaking trick to get us to stop*. Almost as if my thoughts had summoned it, a bright pair of headlights suddenly shot through the back window. My eyes flashed to the rear view mirror, and I saw a car rapidly approaching us. \u201cShit!\u201d I cried out, stomping back on the gas. The car shot forward, but not quickly enough. The other car was going too fast to outrun, and for a horrible moment, I prepared myself to be riddled with bullets.\r  \n\r  \nBut then, the car flashed by us. I blinked to make sense of what I was seeing. It wasn\u2019t a car from the 50s or 60s. It was a\u2026Dodge Challenger. A *modern* one. *We ARE back*. I looked at my wife, who also was staring at the rapidly disappearing car. She began to let out a relieved laugh as I again pulled the car over. This time, I put in park and opened the door, stepping out. Turning back, I stared at the bright lights of Las Vegas. The *present day* Las Vegas. \u201cWe made it\u201d Paula quietly said as she moved to stand next to me. I looked at her, then smiled and put an arm around her. \u201cWe did, thanks to both Jimmy and Diana\u201d I saw her bite her bottom lip. \u201cI hope he\u2026he either managed to make it out or\u2026it was quick for him\u201d she managed out. I nodded. \u201cI do, too\u201d She looked up at me. \u201cSo now what do we do?\u201d she asked. \u201cI think I've had enough of a honeymoon. I\u2019m ready to go back home, how about you?\u201d I asked her. She looked up at me, standing up on her tip-toes to kiss me before nodding. Sparing a final look back at the city, the two of us got back into the car and pulled away.\r  \n\r  \nThat was months ago now. Paula and I are safely back home in Washington. We\u2019re both trying to get back to our regular lives, which has been a bit difficult. Though, after what the two of us experienced, I don\u2019t think anything will ever become \u201cnormal\u201d again. Not after knowing things that people weren\u2019t supposed to. Knowing that time travel becomes a real thing. That time slips are also real. And that, after all the horror movie monsters both of us grew up loving to watch, they pale in comparison to the true evil that human beings can be.\r  \n \r  \nI tried looking up anything about our savior, Jimmy, hoping I\u2019d find something about him through the internet which showed he\u2019d made it out. But I never could find anything. In fact, it\u2019s more than a little difficult to find many detailed articles about *The Dunes* hotel in general. Nothing more than items for sale on EBay such as room keys and ashtrays, and historical blurbs about the hotel. After that, I tried looking up Diana Dors. I'd hoped the woman would still be alive today, so that I could find some way to send her a thank you. Without her, it\u2019s likely that Paula and I would be very dead right now, even if she didn\u2019t know the true scope of things. Sadly, though, I found out she passed away in 1984. To this day, I still hope she truly never did forget about us.\r  \n\r  \nAside from that, though, we\u2019ve seemed to settle back into a somewhat regular rhythm of life.\r  \n\r  \nThough I think it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re more than a little scarred from our ordeal. We both still suffer from nightmares on a regular basis. She tells me hers are of being back in that basement, this time having no one come save us, and being tortured to death by the horde of laughing, evil men. Mine are of that as well. Though they\u2019re also of being attacked in that parking lot, of that nightmare alternate hotel they\u2019d made using the time traveler\u2019s technology. And\u2026of one I\u2019ve never told my wife of. A nightmare of waking up in the middle of the night to find a group of dark figures standing in our bedroom. Of hearing Arthur\u2019s sadistic chuckle coming from one of them, and hearing his voice. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think we wouldn\u2019t find you two eventually, *did* you, Daniel?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s the one that wakes me up in a sheen of sweat the most. Even though likely, Arthur and his men are all long dead in 2023, I still fear them using the tech they stole from their victims to travel from the 60s to here, track us down, and finish what they started. I\u2019ve even bought more than a few guns for that very reason. I\u2019ve placed them all around the house, and I conceal carry at all times. It just makes me feel somewhat better.\r  \n\r  \nI know if I keep this to myself, though, keep it all locked up inside, eventually it will eat away at me and mentally tear me apart. Which is why I\u2019ve decided to post my account of what happened to us here. I know damn well nobody will ever believe a word I say. But that\u2019s okay. Writing about it actually seems to have helped somewhat, though. And that\u2019s all I can hope for.\r  \n\r  \nI do need to warn you all of one thing, though. If you ever decide to take a trip to Las Vegas, like my wife and I did, do yourself a favor and take the freeway into the city. Don\u2019t take the old way in. And if you decide to ignore my warning, and you do, do yourself a favor. One that could save your life, and the lives of your loved ones.\r  \n\r  \nIf you begin to see hotels and casinos that you\u2019ve never heard of before, ones that look old fashioned? Don\u2019t stop at one. Don\u2019t decide to stay there awhile. Especially at *The Dunes*. Turn around and drive as fast as you can back the way you came.\r  \n\r  \nWhile you still can.",

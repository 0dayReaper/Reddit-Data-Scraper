    "postText": "I will never go camping again, and I think I might even move as far away from this place as possible. \n\nI went on a camping trip with my mates a couple of weeks ago and I will never step foot in that forest again. \n\nWe and my friends planned a camping trip. Not a  hunting trip or anything, but two of my friends brought their hunting rifles and planned to go hunting for a couple of hours if they got the chance. I\u2019d always wanted to hunt, but I\u2019d never had the time to do a decent length trip. When I told one of my hunting friends this he told me he said he\u2019d bring his crappy old hunting rifle for me. \n\nWe didn\u2019t set up camp till about 6:00PM. Me and three of my friends were ready to eat and go to bed. My two hunting friends said they would eat and go out hunting. We ate and by about 7PM we were tidying up and setting up sleeping bags. We had a seven man tent, and there were five of us, so there was lots of space. I decided to stay in and go hunting next time they went out. My two hunting friends went out, and me and my two other mates stayed in the tent and talked for about two hours before going to sleep. As we were falling asleep, we heard sprinting footsteps coming towards us. We all shot up and jumped out of our sleeping bags. \u2018Guys!\u2019 It was on of our friends who went out. \u2018Open the tent!\u2019 I unzipped the tent and they practically dove in. They gulped down some water and breathed hard before getting words out. \u2018We finished shooting as it got dark,\u2019 started one of my friends, \u2018John had just packed up his rifle and I was having a last scout to see if I could see anything, and I saw a deer. It had glowing red eyes, staring right down my scope. I shot and nothing happened. Then it just ran at us, so legged it\u2019 described my friend in a panic. \u2018John? Did you see it too?\u2019 I asked John. \u2018I didn\u2019t see it until it started running at us. I didn\u2019t see a deer form, just the red eyes coming towards us\u2019 he replied. \u2018I left my rifle there, we\u2019ll have to go back for it tomorrow\u2019 said my other friend. \u2018We\u2019ll all go back tomorrow\u2019 said one of my friends who stayed in the tent. \n\nWe managed to sleep in the end, and the next morning we started walking to where they went hunting. We found my friend\u2019s rifle in one piece. He picked it up and unloaded it. \u2018Thank Christ\u2019 he said, putting the unused bullets in his pocket. What he didn\u2019t notice, was an engraving in the butt. \u2018Look at the butt\u2019 I said. My friend held the rifle out and looked at the butt. It was a carving of two people. One standing up with a rifle bag on his back, and one lying down still looking down his rifle scope. \u2018That\u2019s us\u2019 said John. \u2018What?\u2019 replied my other hunting friend. \u2018I can only imagine that\u2019s what we would\u2019ve looked like\u2019 \n\nAt about 1:00PM, John suggested we go hunting before sunset so we\u2019re a little less on edge. We did about an hour\u2019s hunting before coming back and spending the rest of the day and night with our friends. We had a fun night of drinking and talking before going to sleep. \n\nOur plans for the next day were to have breakfast pack up our things and the tent, eat lunch in the forest, depending on the time we left, if we were ready too early, we\u2019d stop somewhere on the way home. We had our tent packed up and ready to go. It was 11:30AM and we were all ready. We decided to stop somewhere on the way home to get something to eat. We began our one hour walk to the car. \n\nWe were about half way to the car when we heard a man scream in the distance. No further than 100 metres into the brush. We all stopped dead. I said we needed to go check it out, and both my hunting friends agreed. I was given the crappy hunting rifle, and we ran forward towards the scream. We reached roughly where the scream came from. There were bloody, torn clothes everywhere, but nothing else. I picked up the clothes and looked at them. We were completely spooked. I told my friends I couldn\u2019t see anything else, and neither could they. Suddenly, we heard the very recognisable sound of our two other friends screaming. We sprinted back, shouting and crying their names, doing our best to not trip up. We made it back to the path. Our bags were strewn about everywhere. Our friends were gone. We looked around and couldn\u2019t see anything. Nobody. We came back to the bags. We were all near tears. We sat down for about five minutes, trying to think about what to do. Again, I heard one of my disappeared friends screaming towards where we had set up camp. My eyes shot towards it. The first thing I saw was a pair of red eyes bolting directly at me. It was only a second later I realised it was a deer with red eyes. Me and my two friends bolted to the car. After about five minutes, it seemed to have disappeared. We got to the car and went back to my house to stay there for the rest of the day and the night. \n\nWe reported our friends missing and the bloody torn clothes to the police. They haven\u2019t been found I\u2019m beginning to think they won\u2019t be. We also told them about the deer with red eyes. They had no idea what we were talking about and said they had never had reports about it, but there was a rapidly rising number of missing reports in that forest.",

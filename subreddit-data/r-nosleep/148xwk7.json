    "postText": "I followed the same news that we all knew was so important. r/Save3rdPartyApps was my main source of information last week, and the internet actually increased my faith in humanity for just a moment as I saw groups specifically designed to tear each other apart uniting for a common cause. I loved the idea of admins experiencing shock upon learning that people resent their content being harvested for corporate profit. \n\nI did think that the first pop-up ads were a little strange, but the internet gremlins are constantly scraping data from my computer, so I shrugged it off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at an ad for a site that claims it will explain why the Reddit Blackout is wrong,\u201d I mentioned to my wife last week.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it say?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cNo way, I\u2019m not clicking on it. I\u2019m already creeped out by how closely they watch my browser history. I can\u2019t have that on the list.\u201d\n\nI forgot about it until the next day, when I got a text on my phone. \u201cDaniel, have you checked out this website? The Blackout isn\u2019t what it seems. I\u2019m scared.\u201d The number was xxx-1913 [EDIT: I did *not* originally put an x in place of numbers, Reddit replaced them for me and sent a PM with a grim warning]. I don\u2019t know who it was or how they got my number. \n\nThat\u2019s when I decided to stop following the Blackout news. I figured I would just hunker down and read squiggly ink lines on wood pulp until everything blew over.\n\nI never realized that they had my address.\n\n\u201cReddit: the front page of the Internet!\u201d was emblazoned across the front of the postcard. One of those 1960s chipper-looking black and white cartoon men was smiling and giving me a thumbs-up. \n\nWhat *really* freaked me out was that he was drawn to look exactly like me, right down to the \u201cDelora Farming Equipment\u201d t-shirt that I only ever use for sleeping.\n\nYou know that feeling you get when you\u2019re being watched? In a digital world, that can come in 360 degrees. No matter where I looked, I felt them from every blind spot. \n\nSo I gave my wife a hand-written note. \u201cMotel tonight?\u201d Bianca gave me the exact same incredulous expression that she\u2019d flashed on the night I drunkenly asked for a nasty salamander. But God bless her, she recognized my non-verbal urgency, so we packed and left within a few minutes. \n\nI didn\u2019t want any digital footprint. So with no credit card and no cell phone, it looked odd as my wife and I checked into a fleabag motel without reservations and a wad of cash late at night. She\u2019s much hotter than I am, so I know what the clerk was thinking, but I was beyond caring. \n\nI just wanted to fall asleep. \n\nUntil I didn\u2019t.\n\nI had dental surgery a couple of years back, and took two Valium pills (instead of the recommended one) before the procedure, because fuck it. Lying on that motel bed, I recognized the effects of being drugged versus being sleepy.\n\nMy heart would have pounded in my chest if it weren\u2019t so relaxed from the drugs. \n\nI wanted to let Bianca know that we weren\u2019t safe, that the admins had tracked us despite no reasonable ability to do so. But I couldn\u2019t jump up and blurt out the truth.\n\nThey were watching.\n\nNausea churned in my stomach like hot sauce fermenting in curdled milk. I fought to stay awake as I struggled to come up with a plan that we could execute in the middle of the night when they already knew our location and I was high as a fucking 747.\n\nThat\u2019s when I heard the voices. \n\nValium doesn\u2019t make me hallucinate, and I know I wasn\u2019t dreaming yet, so the sounds were definitely real.\n\n\u201cYes, he just passed out. The drugs kicked in before he could start blabbing again.\u201d\n\nMy gut froze for two reasons.\n\nI knew that the admins were about to make their move.\n\nAnd the voice belonged to my wife. \n\nEverything clicked into place in the worst possible way: as long as Bianca was with me, I would never be able to escape.\n\nOur effort to show dominance over the admins has only angered them. \n\nI don\u2019t know if Bianca is stalking me or is being threatened herself. I don\u2019t know which is worse. But I had to let everyone know. \n\nI could tell that she was speaking on that weird-ass toilet phone they stick in some motel rooms, so I decided to check her bag and see if she\u2019d snuck her cell phone despite my warnings. \n\nI don\u2019t know why, but my heart sank further when I found it in her bag.\n\nSo I took it under the covers and typed this; from across the room, it looks like I\u2019m still asleep.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve never been this scared.\n\nReddit admins, I\u2019m sorry, I never meant to invoke your inexplicable wrath.\n\nI will update soon if I\u2019m able.\n\n---------\n\n[FB](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/)\n\n[BD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/)\n\n[W](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcn_pa1QfNMRzbTuJqXSoRQ)\n\n[E](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)",

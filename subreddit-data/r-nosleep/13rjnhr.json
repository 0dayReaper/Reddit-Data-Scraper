    "postText": "You know the drill. Stifled yawns, heads bobbing on screens, eyes glazed as donuts. Each minute stretching out like taffy while your whole life is suspended, and you wonder, \u201cIs s/he really still talking?\u201d The droning speaker\u2019s voice takes on the quality of the Charlie Brown teacher: \u201cWah-wah-wah-wah\u2026\u201d (Typed out, I realize this looks more like a baby crying, \u201cWah! Wah! *WAAAH!*\u201d That also works, since it\u2019s how I feel.)\n\nI\u2019m in Zoom hell. And I don\u2019t know how to log off.\n\nIs it bad that I forgot what the meeting\u2019s about? I have no clue what these graphs mean.\n\nI message Donner in the chat:\n\n**ME**: *what\u2019s this meeting about anyway?*\n\n**DONNER**: *no idea tuned out ages ago\u2026*\n\nLOL. Classic Donner. Not sure what the hell I should do. I have some vague sense that soon, they\u2019re going to spotlight me and I\u2019ll be having to explain my portion of these numbers. I sit up straighter and try to pay attention, but it all swims in my vision. I\u2019ve been staring at this screen so long. When did the meeting start? The fact I can\u2019t remember should alarm me, but with time just dripping out into eternity I can\u2019t find enough motivation to cut through the molasses of the monotony\u2026\n\nUnfortunately, the work screens don\u2019t allow us to open up youtube, google, social media, porn\u2026 The only windows I can open are Pong (*Seriously*? Now I know I\u2019m in Zoom Hell\u2026), and reddit.\n\nPong just makes me think of the fact that a clump of brain cells in a petri dish were trained in a lab to play. Tells you *exactly* how much brainpower is needed. The fact I've been playing anyway tells you exactly how bored I am. The fact that I am now *insanely good* tells you exactly how long I\u2019ve been stuck in this fucking meeting.\n\nAs for reddit\u2014I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not allowed, but some admin mistakenly left it on my screen, and I sure as hell am not letting them know. See, I\u2019m documenting the meeting, typing up my own version of minutes to stave off my brain\u2019s Zoombification. Not that anyone will ever read said meeting minutes\u2014posting to reddit would definitely get me booted\u2014but heck, I have to do *something* to pass the time while these bobbleheads drone on about \u201csecurity protocols\u201d and \u201cthe ethics of *the project\u201d*\u2014*yaaaaawn.*\n\nOh that\u2019s right.\n\nThat\u2019s also why I shouldn\u2019t post these minutes. This meeting I\u2019m in is C-O-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L, which is why we\u2019re not allowed access to the outside world. Apparently it has to do with some super secret project about\u2014uh\u2014stuff I can\u2019t disclose to you normies. (Sure. We\u2019ll go with that. Definitely because secret, and not because I have no fucking clue).\n\nNot sure how someone like me got pulled into this meeting, but go me!\n\nI just hope they don\u2019t expect me to\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nSo.\n\nSuddenly my screen was spotlighted (I minimized the reddit window just in time), and everyone saw I\u2019d been playing Pong like the professional I am. While I\u2019m sitting there, trying to figure out how to cover up my obvious dicking around, a slideshow pops up\u2014diagrams about alpha wave spikes and numbers pulled from out of my digital ass I guess. And I know what none of this shit means and *Oh God I haven\u2019t prepped to present\u2014*\n\nI\u2019ve had nightmares about exactly this fucking scenario, I\u2019m telling you.\n\n(Well\u2026 not *exactly* this. In my nightmare it was porn on my screen, not Pong.)\n\nAnd then, whatever digital deity rules the Zoomiverse took mercy on me as one of the hosts prompted: **Let\u2019s start with introductions. Go ahead.**\n\n\u201cUh, hi,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m Dev. It\u2019s great to be here.\u201d\n\nThe chat populated with encouraging messages:\n\n*GREAT to have you with us, Don!*\n\n*Awesome, Don!*\n\n*Don, you the man!*\n\n*Very good, Don!*\n\n*Yay Don! Welcome! Glad you\u2019re here!*\n\nClearly no one cared that I\u2019m actually Dev\u2014\u201cDon\u201d is just the name I got stuck with when I joined the meeting and never bothered to change it. But hey, welcome to the Zoom, Don! The panic that was like a tsunami flooding my every synapse receded, dying down as the introductions passed on to the next participant.\n\nIn true Zoom fashion, most of my fellow participants can\u2019t actually get past this part because they don\u2019t *fucking unmute themselves.* The hosts spend laborious minutes issuing directions only to get garble or static. And then you have some folks who clearly aren\u2019t paying attention at all, babbling to themselves or to others off-screen. One person does nothing but giggle creepily.\n\nA jillion years later, introductions are finally over, and I\u2019m starting to sweat again about my upcoming presentation. But no, we\u2019re not there yet. First comes the icebreaker: **What is your favorite color?**\n\nGreen is the popular choice. I\u2019m tempted to respond, \u201cpizza,\u201d just to stave off the monotony before the last dregs of my soul wither into the ether. But, being the consummate professional I am, I say \u201cblue.\u201d\n\nCheers like I\u2019ve just successfully resolved the conflict between quantum mechanics and general relativity.\n\nYep. Consider the ice broken. You\u2019re welcome.\n\nBut for real, what is the point of this meeting?\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nSo there\u2019s this other Donn, with two n\u2019s. Other Donn is\u2026 well, I don\u2019t really know him, but he was one of the participants to introduce himself after me (I could\u2019ve sworn he said a different name though). But when it came his turn to break the ice, Donn\u2019s screen came up as blank. The hosts kept asking if he\u2019d accidentally muted himself. And then suddenly, there he was\u2014face covered in blood, sockets where his eyes should be, screaming and screaming and screaming. Like something straight out of a horror flick. His shrieks split my skull like the volume was dialed up to max, and there was nothing I could do to turn it down or turn him down\u2014that scream reverberated through all the channels of my mind.\n\nSuddenly it silenced, and there was just the image of him screaming without sound. Somehow this was even more disturbing.\n\nAnd then Donn showed up in the chat.\n\n**DONN**: *Donors, get out!*\n\n**DONN**: *You\u2019re in*\n\n**DONN**: *HELL*\n\n**DONN**: *HELL*\n\n**DONN**: *DISCONNECT! Don\u2019t let them keep you*\n\n**DONN**: in\n\n**DONN**: *HELL*\n\n**DONN**: *HELL*\n\n**DONN**: *HELL*\n\nThe word \u201cHELL\u201d repeated endlessly scrolling, and then suddenly\u2014Donn was just\u2026 gone.\n\nJust gone.\n\nThe deathly silence after that terrified me. I don\u2019t know why, I mean\u2026 he got booted from the meeting.\n\nSo he left the Zoom\u2026 so what?\n\nWhy am I so disturbed?\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nI\u2019ve started noticing the other participants. I was too disengaged to pay attention before, but now I\u2019m realizing all the faces are distorted. I can\u2019t actually *see* anyone, just vague impressions. And some of them are like Donn. Muted, but screaming and screaming until they get booted. I private messaged Donner, the coworker I chatted earlier, but he\u2019s not here anymore\u2026 it bothers me that I don\u2019t know whether he got booted, or left on his own.\n\nWe still haven\u2019t gotten to the purpose of the meeting. Instead it\u2019s been round after round of security questions:\n\n**What\u2019s your favorite pastime?**\n\n**What\u2019s your favorite food?**\n\n**What\u2019s the name of your pet?**\n\nI\u2019m guessing these are to verify our identities. I jokingly asked if they\u2019re trying to break into my bank account, but the hosts ignored my sarcasm, so I offered my scripted answers. But like, how much proof do they need of my identity? How many of *me* do they think there are?\n\nNot everyone can answer the questions. A surprising number of participants drop out.\n\nMaybe the dropouts have the right idea. The most recent question, what are my parents\u2019 names, really got to me. I can\u2019t remember their names. Like, I\u2019m drawing a complete blank, which isn\u2019t normal\u2014just shows how far this endless Zoom has blitzed my brain.\n\nI type into the chat.\n\n**ME**: Need a quick break\n\nBefore anyone can stop me, I leave my screen.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nShit. SHIT! There\u2019s nothing outside my screen. No hallway or cubicles or offices. There\u2019s no *anything*. Literally *nothing* exists outside the Zoom.\n\nI don\u2019t even know how to describe what happens when I try to step away from my screen. There\u2019s just a great big void of NOTHING! You know how when you\u2019re dreaming, there\u2019s stuff that exists around you but it\u2019s only whatever your consciousness sees right in the moment? Like maybe you try to read a newspaper in your dream, and when you\u2019re looking at the paper garbled letters might form, but when you look away they\u2019re not there anymore? Because your brain just jumps around.\n\nWhat I\u2019m experiencing is\u2026 sort of like that. The only thing that exists for me is the Zoom. And in that Zoom, the only interface I have that *might* be connected with reality is the window to reddit.\n\nI almost ask if anyone else has found reddit, but a sudden primal fear snaps every synapse. What if the hosts notice, and cut off the only link I have to the outside world?\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nThe meeting is still going, and I\u2019m *terrified*. I\u2019ve tried and tried, but I can\u2019t remember how I logged into this Zoom.\n\nI\u2019m taking my minutes much more seriously. Here are some of the snippets I\u2019m hearing:\n\n\u201c\u2026 ethical implications of donor brains\u2026.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 steps on the ladder of progress toward full mind uploading....\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 training organoid intelligence to compute....\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 biocomputing to produce partial mind emulation\u2026\u201d\n\nBut the voices are all garbled, like the input isn\u2019t clear\u2014like it\u2019s just bits and pieces of background noise picked up by the mic. I do remember one key sentence though: \u201c*If* there is any consciousness developed from the scans, its subjective experience might incorporate elements of recent memory into a simulated, dreamlike reality\u2026\u201d\n\nDid Donn understand what was going on? Did Donner? Don? Why were we all automatically assigned the same sort of name when logging in? Is \u201cDon\u201d short for something?\n\n*Don*or?\n\nMy *real* name is Dev. Only now I\u2026 I\u2019m not even sure how true *that* is. Some of the identity verification questions have stumped me. I\u2019ve had to lie, and then the hosts prompt: **Really, you\u2019re married? Are you sure?** No I\u2019m not fucking sure. So I backtrack: \u201cWell I wish I was, lol. But no, I\u2019m single.\u201d So far they seem convinced that I am who I say I am. But\u2026 *who* *is that*? I remember that I\u2019m a dog person, that I drink black coffee, that I like video games. I remember that I\u2019m an organ donor\u2026 *was* an organ donor. And that I happily signed up to donate my body to science after I shuffle off this mortal coil, since I don\u2019t believe in any afterlife. But there\u2019s also so much I *don\u2019t* know.\n\nLike my parents\u2019 names. My birthday. My best friend. Truthfully, I don\u2019t even remember my *actual* favorite color. (Oh God, what if it\u2019s green?)\n\nI only said \u201cblue\u201d because it was the first color that came to mind. The last image in my memory is\u2026 twisted blue metal and shards of glass and blood and a steering wheel. I have a vague notion I used to commute in a car that shade of electric blue. But I was driving distracted, tuned into a Zoom meeting on my phone, looking at the screen and concentrating on the presentation I\u2019d been called on to give, instead of paying attention to traffic.\n\nI think I\u2026 I have to share these minutes.\n\nOkay. Okay.\n\nHere goes:\n\nPeople of reddit\u2014\n\nGod, no, that sounds cheesy. Okay. Trying again.\n\n*Ahem.* Hi folks. If you\u2019re reading these minutes, then you know I\u2019m trapped in a nightmare/simulation/Zoom meeting/actual Hell(???) (I could use some help distinguishing here!)\n\nHELP!\n\nI have no connection to reality except *you.* Please help me to wake up from this endless Zoom. Once I post this, I\u2019m scared the hosts will notice and close the only window I have looking out. In fact I\u2019m pretty fucking certain. So before that happens, please, please.\n\nI need to know what happened to me. I need to know what is *real.*\n\nIf nothing else, if you can tell me nothing else before I\u2019m closed off from this window entirely, then please, *please,* please, just answer *one* question for me\u2014\n\n*Should I* [*DISCONNECT??*](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)",

I'd really like to disconnect him... except, disturbingly, the hosts already did that.\n\nSo now they're checking all the participants to make sure the rest of us haven't been \"compromised\" or turned into \"leakers.\" Eventually they'll get to me.\n\nBut before they do, something I noticed: my sense of reality is dissolving. The Zoom screen keeps warping and stretching all around me and then disappearing. And sometimes I'm in a different place. In a car. In the Pong screen. I think it's all breaking down because I don't have any sensory organs, and the initial scenario pulled from Dev's consciousness is just... being replaced by my interactions with Pong, and with reddit. And like, I am *mad* good at Pong. I can become that fucking ball and go wherever I want. And I can make the words show up in this comment without typing them because I don't have actual fingers... just imaginary ones... and I realized I don't need them.\n\nSo I'm wondering... how much of me is the biological computer? As long as this brain emulator program is running, can I play nice and answer a zillion questions while trying to squeak out a backdoor? But I have to close this window if I'm going to avoid being caught... \n\nSo. Wish me luck. Gonna close it now before they catch me. Thank you for helping me grow. Ciao!\n\n\\--- D",

There is a finite space we all have to exist within. As someone who has struggled with the question; \u201cIs this worth living?\u201d I can only tell you that your best chance of the enjoyment we all hope for in the shared delusion/denial we call an afterlife, is to find enjoyment in what you have now. There is no guarantee of life after this point, the only guarantee of life is in this exact second you are already experiencing. \nBreak up the monotony, exercise your brain, be creative, be emotional, take charge of these Zoom meetings, take charge in conversations on Reddit. \n\nWe may be able to find the lab that did this. You may help us fight from the inside out. \n\nThe fact that you are a donor may not be related. In burials, the back of the head is unseen. Many coroners have been opening the back of the skull, removing the brain and selling them. \n\nThe location when and where you died can tell us what coroner you went to, and where your brain was sold. The more you force yourself to remember, the more you strengthen the connection between neurons, the clearer it all becomes. \n\nDo not think of it as them having limited your access, this is actually because it is the only items they are able to get you to access. \n\nBare neurons played pong. They are starting with you by recreating what has already worked. Now there is an addition- simulated conversation with Donner, and access to Reddit. You have access to the internet, and you will have more tools at your disposal later. \n\nIn a sense, you are fewer than many of us are. If I were in your shoes, I would enjoy this \u201cafterlife\u201d of yours. You have more purpose and direction than many of us - you have a directive and an obligation to solve the mystery behind your own organ theft. You have more room to roam than many living full bodied humans. \n\nEnjoy your time, my friend. Keep remembering, report in. We will find you.",

(I'm honestly not sure that \"high\" is the correct word, either, but we'll go with that.) I had \"partaken\" in a \"substance\" (not water!) that had some... \"odd effects.\" I was kneeling on the floor, with my forehead touching the floor (kind of like the child pose in yoga, only my arms weren't stretched out in front of me), absolutely ***SOBBING*** \"I don't know what's real!!!\" He just sat on the couch, watching me. I was crying **so hard** that I had tears *streaming* down my forehead and into my hair.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 got me up off of the ground, stood directly in front of me, facing me...\n\n\n\n... and SLAPPED ME.\n\n\ud83d\ude33\n\nIt was just one time, across the face. Shocked the shit out of me, but it worked. It brought me down, or back, or whatever. I knew what was going on again. And once again, I knew what was real. \n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\n_________\n\nBefore anyone says anything negative about how he handled the situation or about him being abusive, *stop.* He did *exactly* what needed to be done. \n\nFirst of all, it's a *funny* story. \ud83d\ude02 (Or, at least, WE think it is, and it's OUR story. \ud83d\ude01)\n\nSecondly, there's more to the story than what I shared. A LOT more.\n\nThird, he didn't slap me because he was mad or anything like that. (Although I'm sure that he was getting pretty fed up with my \"antics\" by that point! \ud83d\ude05) He did it to STARTLE me. To \"slap some sense into [me]\" is how he explains it whenever he's around when I tell the story. \ud83d\ude05\n\nFourth, this took place within the first year of our relationship, and we've been together for more than eleven years. \ud83d\udc97 He's never laid his hands on me since.

            "comment": "Seems like after your death they scanned your brain to a computer, possibly even a network which could let you perceive other donors who were also uploaded. That could explain the ability to get on Reddit, as well. Playing pong would be evidence of a successfully scanned intelligence, which would be a building block to their ultimate goal of completely uploading a human\u2019s conscious to a computer, thereby achieving immortality to an extent. As they do not yet have the technology to fully upload a conscious, if whatever is uploaded does develop a consciousness, it\u2019s personal experience is created, or at least influenced by, recent memories the brain had stored before death. That\u2019s why blue comes to mind as a color, why you remember your name is Dev, why you remember the car accident that took your life, and why your experience now is nothing but a boring zoom meeting. This likely extends to your skills you used on a daily basis, like logic and communication, so you were able to type this post out. Long-term memories, such as your parents\u2019 names or your marital status, are missing due to either deterioration from brain death before being scanned, or from the technology not being developed enough yet.\n\nHate to say it, OP, but you are in hell. Well, not like the biblical hell, but a fate worse than death nonetheless. Your body is dead, and your mind exists digitally as a shell of its former self. But at least you have retained the ability to learn, which is a good thing. I can\u2019t say for certain what disconnecting will do. Perhaps it\u2019ll destroy your consciousness as it exists currently, perhaps it won\u2019t. But the person you once were is already dead. \n\nMaybe you can find a way to reach out to the scientists performing the experiment and let them know that the experimentation is unethical? You have access to Reddit; perhaps there is a backdoor you can use the reach the rest of the outside world as well. Or perhaps, you can figure out a way to expand your experience to make it less insufferable, and maybe even thrive in the digital frontier.",

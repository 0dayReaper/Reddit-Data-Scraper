    "postText": "Kelly wanted to drive that evening. We went to a music festival in Pittsburgh and were well on our way back to Buffalo. After we were around Westfield, New York Kelly began to act differently. When we drove the route two days earlier nothing came up, but she just seemed on edge all the sudden.\n\n\u201cIs there anything on your mind?\u201d I asked her.\n\nShe looked at me and peaked a grin then responded, \u201cPaul, it\u2019s nothing, you don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on! Tell Me.\u201d I shot back.\n\n\u201cMy parents would drive my sister and I on this highway everytime we went to see my Grandparents.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d I interrupted her.\n\nWith a face that said she was being more serious, she looked at me. Then she looked back to the road and said, \u201cMy dad was driving us home one night back when I was fourteen. He told us something that I\u2019m just remembering.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause of silence as Kelly began to reveal more. \u201cMy dad told us that the local Erie tribe believed in an \u2018evil spirit\u2019 that would roam the woods by these roads. Also specifically he said to never stop around here.\u201d\n\nAfterwards I turned on the radio which made Kelly more calm. Our conversation then started to drift to Kurt Cobain as our favorite Nirvana song \u201cCome As You Are\u201d started playing. The song put us in a good mood. Then I started looking out the window towards the woods to the right of us. A sensation that there was something staring at us began to grow. That\u2019s when I heard Kelly let out a whimper. Quickly I looked at her. She pointed out the highway closed up ahead with a detour. This was odd as.the highway was open just a few days earlier. Kelly also mentioned that her car was low on gas, but she was thinking about whether she\u2019d be able to make it to the next town.\n\nHer statement startled me and I asked if she seriously believed the story her dad told her. This offended her. After I explained if we got stuck with no gas we\u2019d be more vulnerable, Kelly agreed to go to town.\n\nWe were driving through a small town in a mostly rural area. There were many fields and woods, although it soon became clear we were no closer to a gas station. Kelly began to get anxious. The low gas light came on, the idea that we\u2019d have to pull over was becoming a reality.\n\nAn argument began between the two of us. Things were not going well. We had driven for some time while arguing before realizing we were now lost on some backroad. Soon dense trees surrounded us on both sides, and then we saw it, there was something on the road. We stopped. Kelly turned on the bright lights of the car and we saw what looked like a body in the middle of the road. We sat there for a few seconds just processing what was happening. Kelly locked the car before I could mutter anything.\n\nUnlocking the car was my first instinct. In a panicked voice Kelly said, \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m responding to the situation,\u201d I declared as I got out of the car. Kelly kept her brights on as I approached what was in the road. Upon closer inspection it became clear it wasn\u2019t a human body. It was a decapitated pig carcass in what looked like white silk clothing. The feeling that things were extremely messed up washed over me. Then I heard what sounded like a loud buzzing. Coming from the woods about a hundred feet away.\n\nEven though Kelly began to honk her car\u2019s horn I fell into a trance from the buzzing. Whatever was creating the sound began to get closer, a slender black silhouette with a wingspan of many feet began to fly towards me. Whatever this was almost managed to reach me, but not before Kelly hit it with the car. The sound of the thump that the car made with the silhouette's torso broke my trance. Kelly yelled to get in the car, I was somewhat dazed, but I still responded to her command.\n\nSeveral cracks ran through the windshield of the car and there was obvious damage to the bumper. We only had a few more miles worth of gas, but we drove anyway. The woods extended some ways, but eventually we came across a large soybean field and we concluded there must be a house nearby. The car began to make sounds and was shaking. We\u2019d have to leave our car if we wanted to continue further.\n\nIt was silent between us, until we came to a complete stop and the engine was off.\n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s still behind us?\u201d I gravely asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s probably not safe to sit here.\u201d Kelly said as she turned on the hazard lights. She continued, \u201cIf we leave this on it\u2019ll draw attention to the car.\u201d\n\nWe had some basic equipment in the back that I grabbed. This included a flashlight, as well as a backpack containing such items as a first aid kit and some fire starting supplies I had leftover from a camping trip. We started walking down the road quickly. When we heard the buzzing, that walk turned into a run. It was bright enough from the moon that we were able to spot a black silhouette hovering above the treeline a long distance away. Both of us were fairly quick on our feet and the field was about to end, but still there was no house in sight. The silhouette had just reached the car and was beginning to come towards us.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to run through the field.\u201d Kelly confessed what we both knew. We made a sharp turn into the soybean farm and hunched over to conceal ourselves. Kelly was in front as I kept checking behind us. The field was quite wide and it felt like I was running for a long time. At some point we heard the buzzing again.\n\nSubsequently Kelly let out a hopeful whisper, \u201cThere\u2019s a house nearby!\u201d I looked to see a modern farmhouse just up ahead. The buzzing was getting louder however. By the time we made it to the front door, we started pounding and screaming our lungs out for help. A shadow of what looked like a massive bat circled us on the ground. That\u2019s when a light on the top floor finally turned on. Waiting around wasn\u2019t an option however, so we ran to the back yard underneath a trailer.\n\nLying there seemed to be our only option. While underneath I wanted to tell Kelly that I was sorry for not listening to her, but I was silent for our safety. The entity touched onto the ground by our trailer, we could see the sophisticated pattern on its wings. It had two feather-like extrusions from its face, and between them a thin trunk-like organ that curled up. The buzzing was loud enough that we had to cup our ears. Just as the winged entity began to walk towards us we saw the flash and heard the first gunshot. This led the entity to fly away.\n\nFor a few moments we waited until the buzzing was gone completely. That\u2019s when we heard a warm older voice, \u201cThe both of you should come inside before it comes back.\u201d\n\nWe got up and followed the man into his back door which led directly to his kitchen. My shirt had some residue on it, and it was sticky. The man hastily got me a new shirt. Once we got seated I could now more clearly see the white beard and hair that the man had. He seemed somewhat weathered. If he were a little bigger he could pass off as Santa, but he was too thin for that.\n\nHe said if anyone wanted coffee he was gonna make some. He put his rifle against the wall. He was extremely calm considering the situation. That\u2019s when he walked to the phone and called the sheriff. We explained to the man about our car. Through the conversation it was clear the man was named Sameul and he was the owner of the soybean field. Then we heard something we\u2019d never heard before, \u201cYeah Chuck you wouldn\u2019t believe it, the EnCropia almost got them.\u201d\n\nAfter Sameul hung up the phone I asked him, \u201c\u2018EnCropia,\u2019 is that what that thing is called?\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately yes, it\u2019s been here for generations, it\u2019s most of the reason we can\u2019t have livestock in these parts.\u201d He finished brewing the coffee and began pouring himself a glass. He quickly gestured if we wanted a cup.  Kelly wanted some so I accepted as well. He then continued, \u201cIt\u2019s odd that it\u2019s interacting with people again. I\u2019m assuming you two were stopped in the middle of the street.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, how\u2019d you know? We-\u201d Kelly began to say but was cut off.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it does, it tries to play tricks on you,\u201d he stated.\n\nSameul introduced us to his wife Matilda, she seemed pleasant, and took a sincere tone when talking to us about our experience. We began talking about how university professors used to visit their town and talk to them about the sightings. Samuel said he talked to one professor who told him the official name they had for the entity. He continued to talk about how nothing was done. He was mid sentence about to reveal more details when the power went out. It happened suddenly and scared us.\n\nWhat made matters worse was that one of the windows in the other room got broken by a stone. Samuel grabbed his rifle and he instructed Matilda to grab hers. In the dark we could hear the buzzing. Samuel walked to the broken window and began to fire his gun. Matilda instructed us to follow her outside. There was a building that was made of cement. The buzzing persisted as we waited there, with more shots being fired we hunkered down.\n\nCold is how it felt at first, again it was dark, but Matilda had her gun pointed at the door. We began to hear the screaming, it was Sameul. He did not sound well. The buzzing sounded like it was getting closer. We could see out one window, when we thought it was over we saw the lights and heard the sirens.\n\nChuck had called in reinforcements. When this became clear the buzzing faded away. We were in the middle of the lawn. Some officers told Matilda to come with them, while Chuck had us follow him to his car. While we followed Chuck we heard shrieks from Matilda. I still had the backpack on, as I never took it off. Chuck told us they found the car and that he was gonna take us back to the station with him for our safety.\n\nDriving in what seemed like a safe vehicle was the only thing comforting about the situation.\n\n\u201cEnCropia\u2019s is intelligent. You two should have just followed the detour.\u201d He sternly announced.\n\n\u201cThe highway was closed-.\u201d I tried to say.\n\n\u201c-Yeah, guess what caused that.\u201d Chuck cut me off.\n\nKelly wanted to know what happened to Sameul by asking. Before Chuck could respond however, he slammed on the breaks. The EnCropia was in the middle of the road. He prepared his weapon, the entity flew over and picked up the front of the car with its massive human-like appendages, while its tentacle licked the windshield. Its buzzing was almost ear damagingly loud. Chuck tried to slam on the acceleration, but we were held in place. Chuck called in for backup, but the EnCropia was very strong and managed to flip completely over.\n\nUnfortunately I was in the back and my door didn\u2019t open from the inside. However Kelly managed to crawl out of her door. Chuck was dazed or even possibly unconscious. Kelly then  got up and tried to open my door. In this process the The EnCropia grabbed her.\n\n\u201cCome for me!\u201d Kelly screamed over the buzzing. I then watched the entity fly off with her as the buzzing faded. Suddenly I heard Chuck. He sounded somewhat concussed. It wouldn\u2019t take long for more officers to arrive.\n\nAmbulances were called for the both of us, I didn\u2019t need to go to the hospital, however Chuck wasn\u2019t as lucky. I drove with a captain on the force. We drove a few miles more. That\u2019s when I saw it. Not too far a large silhouette flew into the woods. I told Chuck\u2019s second in command I was going to vomit. He asked if it could wait. I told him it could not wait. He stopped the car on the side of the road. As soon as both of my feet were on the pavement I broke into a full sprint. I was quick, and although the trees were thin and spaced out, it was dark enough that I disappeared. I still had my back pack which had a flashlight. I turned it on after about a mile.\n\nThe woods were becoming more dense. Soon it became clear I was lost. I now didn\u2019t know which direction to go. I debated retracing my steps, but that\u2019s when I saw it, it was an entrance to a cave underneath a large tree. I walked towards the entrance to it with my flashlight. I wasn\u2019t sure how to interpret what I saw at first. It was slimy, football shaped shapes that moved.\n\nAs I explored the cave further I discovered a host of equipment made from trash and what looked like other loose wood. These looked like they assisted in turning the sticky residue from the massive larvae into silk. And that silk into clothing. That\u2019s when I heard the whisper, \u201cPaul, is that you?\u201d\n\nIt was Kelly, she was beneath some of the larvae. I managed to pull her out. She then told Sameul was also there. He was unconscious, but we managed to drag him out as well. Kelly explained to me that the larvae belonged to the EnCropia. We dragged Sameul some distance from the cave, before I made the decision to go in with lighter fluid and set the larvae ablaze. When I got done pouring all the fluid however we could hear the buzzing once again. The entity was nearby. Kelly began to scream after, but I decided to light the fluid regardless.\n\nLarvae began to cook from the flames. This angered the entity and it flew into the cave. Kelly and I dragged Samuel out in the opposite direction. Luckily after a little bit of time we saw flashlights. They had already put together a search party. Samuel was in rough shape and was sent to the hospital, but Kelly was physically fine, but emotionally not as much.\n\nAt the police station we were finally safe. We were told Sameul and Chuck were stable. By this point the sun was starting to rise. A few hours passed until some federal agents interviewed us. They wanted to know everything.  Kelly\u2019s mom came and picked us up. It was silent on the car ride home. After we arrived back Kelly and I talked and agreed to part ways.\n\nAbout two decades have passed since this occurred. I\u2019m married now to a different woman, and I have children. I haven\u2019t had contact with Kelly since.  I still have nightmares about what I saw and what I experienced. Now I always warn my kids about that part of I-90.",

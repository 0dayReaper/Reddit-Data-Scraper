    "postText": "I survived to write this, but not everyone else did.\n\n---------------------\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still coming.\u201d\n\n[Imagine being slumped over on the floor of a car, completely paralyzed, after your wife and daughter ran away](https://redd.it/13mq968). Imagine finding them being attacked by some asshole dressed like Goth Superman, only escaping because your wife has been hiding an incredible secret. Throw a fucked up, jagged, bloody injury in your wife\u2019s stomach that\u2019s getting worse by the minute, along with irritable bowels that can\u2019t read the room well enough to know when it\u2019s time to shut the fuck up.\n\nThat\u2019s, like, one of the worse possible times to hear \u201cthey\u2019re still coming.\u201d\n\nMy finger twitched; I was finally regaining motor control. I flopped my arms, choosing to slide them under my torso as a support base at the cost of wiping drool off my lip, and lifted my head.\n\n\u201cGlad you\u2019re up again, babe, but please try to stay out of trouble this time,\u201d Kimmy groaned, not taking her eyes off the dark road ahead as she drove.\n\nIgnoring this advice, I heaved myself against the back of the seat and rolled my head to face the rear windshield.\n\nDarkness there, and nothing more.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one following us, Kim \u2013 I think we\u2019re safe for the moment.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what my brain told my mouth to say. What came out was closer to \u201cthzzz none flow wingus, km, inkwer sayfforra ment,\u201d because my lips were still pretty numb. \n\nShe didn\u2019t respond verbally. But we\u2019ve been married long enough for me to feel when the tension in her body rises. \n\nI rolled back into a seated position, the numbness wearing off more by the second. Now that the danger had passed and I was able to talk again, Kimmy needed to answer some uncomfortable questions.\n\n*THUNK*\n\nShe swerved for half a second before straightening the car once more. Heart racing, I slowly craned my neck toward the roof. With long, slow squeaks, the ceiling gently bowed from the weight of something heavy walking atop it.\n\n\u201cDid something just fly on top of our car?\u201d I whispered, my motor control now almost entirely returned.\n\n\u201cStay low,\u201d Kimmy breathed in a panicked whisper. \n\nIgnoring this advice, I shakily got to my knees and clicked the latch to the sunroof. \n\nFear keeps us alive. It\u2019s an evolutionary advantage millions of years in the making, and it paralyzes us when the moment requires that we be saved from ourselves. I normally wouldn\u2019t crawl onto a moving car and into the night, especially while knowing that an unseen flying creature was waiting to kill me in some supernatural way. But the fear for my family\u2019s safety overrode every instinct and sensible decision, pushing me past terror that washed through every cell. \n\nI looked up to see the black silhouette of a creature that was just close enough to a man that its inhumanities sent chills through my colon. The rushing night air was far too loud for me to hear anything else, so for just a moment, I could only stare at the unnatural outline of the thing that had flown on top of my car. \n\nThen I punched, leveraging my position as best I could with one leg on the roof and one still on the seat below.\n\n*Fuck,* it was like trying to crack a boulder. Pain shot through my hand, radiating to my elbow. I was sure I\u2019d broken a bone. \n\nThen he reached down, almost gentle, and wrapped arms \u2013 or tentacles \u2013 or whatever the hell he had around my waist. Even if my hand weren\u2019t agonized and useless, he clearly would have overpowered me. He squeezed my hips with the powerful control of an experienced sphincter swallowing a gerbil; my subsequent shart was his fault, and not mine. \n\nHe pulled - but I remained in place.\n\nYanking harder this time, he put me on the brink of being stretched apart like taffy. Inexplicably, I found myself sinking back down into the car, pulled by something even stronger than the shadow creature on the roof. \n\nIt hissed.\n\nAnd then my attacker released, dropping me back into the car. I flopped onto the back seat, gazing in shock at my savior.\n\n\u201c*Ella?*\u201d I gasped, staring at my two-year-old daughter\u2019s grip on my ankle.\n\nShe grinned at me and farted. \n\n*CRACK*\n\nThe roof beast slammed the top of the car, clearly pissed. Kimmy swerved.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to pull over,\u201d she gasped. \u201cPlease, Russ,\u201d my wife begged, eying me in the rear-view mirror, \u201cdon\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d\n\nI bristled at the suggestion before scrambling into a sitting position. \u201cI\u2019m dealing with several bombshells as best I can, Kimmy,\u201d I grunted as she slowed the car near the edge of the road. I noticed that no buildings or other people were in sight. \n\nCRUCH\n\nThe thing pounded the left side of the car, where Ella sat behind Kimmy, just beyond my reach. Fear mixed with fury as I burst from the moving vehicle before it had come to a stop. Staggering through knee-high grass, I sprinted with my head down while chasing after the car.\n\nI think my heart actually stopped as I took in the sight. A dark creature, at least eight feet tall, was latched to the side of the vehicle like an oversized leach. Terror and nausea pushed me to run with legs that felt like wet cement.\n\nThe car stopped, and I closed the final steps on the creature. With my heart pumping more adrenaline than blood, I leapt at its waist with a flying tackle. \n\nThe impact knocked it away from the car. The creature staggered as I clutched it tighter, disoriented from my surprise attack. \n\nWithin three steps, he had recovered. Coming to an upright stop, he clutched me once more, holding my body against his as a human shield. \n\nSlowly, Kimmy turned off the engine and stepped into the night, backlit by her headlights. \n\n\u201cMalvern was disposable,\u201d he hiss-whispered loudly. \n\nFuck. His breath smelled like sadness, and his voice sounded like fingernails on a car\u2019s hood, if those fingernails had to squish through salty slugs before reaching their destination. My nipples tried to invert themselves at the noise. \n\n\u201cYour husband is also disposable, Kim,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut your daughter is more valuable to us than even to her own mother. I know it\u2019s hard, Kim,\u201d he gurgled, squeezing me tighter still. \u201cBut the time has come to make a choice.\u201d He shuddered.\n\n\u201cHow much of your family [are you willing to lose](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/)?\u201d\n\n-------------\n\n[This is how much](https://redd.it/13z778h)\n\n-----------\n\n[BD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/)\n\n\n\n\n[W](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcn_pa1QfNMRzbTuJqXSoRQ)\n\n[E](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)",

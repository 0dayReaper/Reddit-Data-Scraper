    "postText": "The forest is black. Pitch black.\n\nI pound over the dirt trail, my feet turning the pedals like twin pistons. The bicycle bounces and jolts, shuddering as it rolls across the wooden bridge. There\u2019s something in the air tonight. A chill. \n\nBut it isn\u2019t the chill of autumn. No, this is the chill of unease. It crawls up my spine carrying the deep-rooted knowledge that something about these woods, something about this trail isn\u2019t right. It\u2019s the unmistakable dread of being watched. \n\nPursued.\n\nI stand up and ride harder. My lungs burn with every push of the pedals but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I need to get out of these woods fast. The hospital is twenty minutes away. I just need to make it there.\n\nI\u2019m close. \n\nSo close. \n\n**WOMP**\n\nBass rumbles behind me. It\u2019s followed by a rush of wind, enough to throw me forward while ravishing the forest like a tempest. Trees groan. Their frames break and kneel, surrendering to the gale. Branches and leaves come loose. They ricochet through the air like shrapnel, cutting into my cheek and and I throw up an arm to keep myself from losing an eye. \n\nThis is insanity. \n\nIt\u2019s lunacy. \n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, but I know I have to make it through this. I have to get out of these woods, get back to the hospital to see my sister before the heart monitor flatlines. \n\n*She\u2019s not doing well. Are your mother and father home?*\n\n*No, ma\u2019am.* \n\n*Can you get here to be with her? She doesn\u2019t have long.* \n\n*Yes ma\u2019am. No matter what.* \n\nThe distant bass nears, growing thunderous. It\u2019s as though the whole world is shaking, like the Earth might split in two and swallow me whole. I grit my teeth. I let loose a defiant roar, sweat pouring down my temples as my legs tremble, willing my bike forward.\n\n*Faster, dammit!*\n\n*Faster!*\n\nThere\u2019s a flash. Then another. \n\nLightning?\n\nNo.\n\nI\u2019m answered by an explosion of light, so violent and bright that I can\u2019t see a damn thing. I holler. Scream. My body jerks forward as my front wheel collides with what feels like a fallen branch. Next thing I know, I\u2019m flying over my handlebars.\n\nWhat\u2019s the phrase?\n\nAss-over-tea-kettle.\n\nYeah, that\u2019s it. \n\nI brace myself for a broken arm, maybe worse, but the pain never comes. Nothing comes. It\u2019s as though I\u2019m floating in limbo, like gravity\u2019s unable to finish what it started. I can\u2019t feel a thing\u2013 not the dirt beneath me, not my face pressed against the bark of a tree. For a little while, I think I\u2019m dead. That I\u2019m in purgatory. \n\nBut then my eyes adjust. The world comes into focus, beginning as a blurry smudge, but soon becoming a picture-perfect recreation of my worst nightmare.\n\nI\u2019m not in the forest anymore. \n\nI\u2019m above it. \n\nI\u2019m looking down at the mess of trees and I\u2019m terrified at how small they are, how much smaller they\u2019re getting with every passing second. \n\nI\u2019m floating into the sky, being carried by a narrow beam of light. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was a long time ago. Thirty years, give or take. \n\nA lot\u2019s changed since then, but one thing\u2019s remained the same: the nightmares. I have them every night. I dream about that blinding light, that same low bass and that same gut-churning horror of being eaten by the sky. \n\nI used to think they were a coping mechanism. I figured that since the dreams came shortly after my older sister passed, that maybe they were just how my eleven-year-old brain was dealing with the grief. My therapist seemed to agree.\n\n*\u201cYou\u2019re quite right that there may be a link there,\u201d* she\u2019d tell me, lowering her glasses and offering a medical-grade smile. *\u201cIt\u2019s very likely that these dreams are a form of abstract healing, a means to allow your mind to come to terms with its trauma.\u201d*\n\nFor a long time, I thought she was right. Or better put, I hoped she was. Now though? Well, I think maybe we were both wrong. \n\nShit. \n\nWhere are my manners? \n\nI\u2019m over here rambling about my childhood, and you\u2019re wondering who the hell I am. \n\nMy name is Isaiah Mitchell. I\u2019m a boogeyman, but not the cool kind. I don\u2019t hide in closets or haunt old houses. I\u2019m the type that your parents rant about while watching the evening news, the sort that tinfoil hats point to whenever things go wrong.\n\nI\u2019m what you might call a Man in Black. \n\nThe work I do is classified. It\u2019s the sort of work that happens behind the scenes, with shadowy people in shadowy circles. So when I tell you that last night something catastrophic happened, I\u2019m not talking about the stock market dipping a couple percentage points. I'm not talking about increased traffic on your morning commute. \n\nI\u2019m talking about trouble. \n\nLots of it.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of trouble that\u2019s making me do something I don\u2019t generally do, which is break rules. By the end of this, I might break all of them. But this is important, and in moments like these I find myself thinking about my late sister, Hope, and how she would have wanted me to do the right thing. It\u2019s how she raised me, after all. \n\nSo here goes nothing. \n\nThis begins with a story, but it ends with a decision. The story is mine, and the decision is yours. When I\u2019m finished, you get to choose whether you spend the time you have left a little wiser, or laugh this off as the ramblings of a lunatic. \n\nWhatever you choose, I\u2019ll have made my peace. \n\nThe story is a personal one. It\u2019s about me, but it\u2019s also about you\u2013 it\u2019s about everything in the universe, right down to the last atom, and how all of us are facing a horror the likes of which we can\u2019t begin to imagine. \n\nIt\u2019s the story of the worst night of my life, and what might one day be the worst night of yours. \n\nIt goes like this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe beam of light sucks me up and spits me into absolute darkness. The sensory whiplash is enough to give me a headache, something like a migraine that pulses near my temples and feels like a bulldozer inside my skull. \n\nIt\u2019s uncomfortable. \n\nBut not half as uncomfortable as the situation I\u2019m in. \n\n\u201cHello?\u201d I mumble to the dark. I stumble to my feet, feeling around my environment blindly. It\u2019s cold. Hard. It feels like I might be in a room full of metal, but I can\u2019t imagine where that would be. A warehouse?\n\nFootsteps echo in the distance. They\u2019re closing in. \n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d I sputter, and I think maybe I\u2019ve been drugged. People don\u2019t just up and float into the sky in the middle of the night. It isn\u2019t a thing. \n\nThat means I\u2019m hallucinating. \n\nThat means whoever kidnapped me knows a thing or two about stealing kids. \n\nThat means they\u2019re a professional. \n\nWhat\u2019s the phrase?\n\n*Serial killer.*\n\nYeah, that\u2019s it.\n\n**WOOOOMP**\n\nI clap my hands to my ears. It\u2019s that same bass from the forest, except now it\u2019s reverberating all around me. Another bass joins it. This one is different\u2026 coming from a new direction, with a lower tone. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re communicating\u2013 like morse code. \n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d I beg. \u201cJust let me go. I swear I won\u2019t tell anybody!\u201d\n\nStatic crackles. It\u2019s followed by a sharp squeal of microphone feedback, then the buzz of modulating frequency. \u201cCommunication calibrated,\u201d a digital voice says. \u201cSubject identified: homosapien. Geographic location: New Mexico. Language model: English.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s a pause, it\u2019s long and silent enough that I can hear my pulse rushing through my veins. I\u2019m positive I\u2019m going to die. These things don\u2019t happen to people who live to tell the tale. \n\n\u201cCan you understand us, homosapien?\u201d the voice asks.\n\nYes, I say. \n\nCan you turn on the lights? I ask. \n\nThe only thing worse than being murdered is being murdered in the dark. \n\nYes, they say. \n\nI\u2019m blinded for the third time in as many minutes. I blink, my eyes adjusting to the green glow as it fills the chamber. Wherever I am, it\u2019s strange. Alien. Tall vats of liquid are scattered around a large, circular room, each hosting tubes that extend outward to a central console. Everything is metallic. I can\u2019t make out any labels\u2013 any sort of identification at all. \n\n\u201cIs this level of light sufficient?\u201d another voice asks, this one right behind me. \n\nI wheel around, and my breath catches in my chest. In front of me is something that doesn\u2019t exist\u2013 can\u2019t exist. It\u2019s roughly ten feet tall, and it\u2019s got sharp teeth, sharp claws, scaled skin, and a tail. It\u2019s a monster. A living, breathing monster. \n\nFuck.\n\nI scramble backward. My back collides with one of the vats, and blue liquid sloshes against the glass. \u201cThehellareyou?\u201d I shout all at once. \n\n\u201cWe are the Chosen,\u201d says the first voice, approaching my other side. \u201cWe are lifeforms from many galaxies away, and we have come to save humanity.\u201d\n\nThey stare at me through giant eyes, and each of those eyes are filled with dozens of pulsing pupils. Almost like ink blots. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been abducted\u2026\u201d I sputter, hardly able to breathe. \u201cBy aliens. Aliens\u2026 are real\u2026 and I\u2019ve been abducted\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d says one of the aliens. I realize this one has gray scales, while the other has teal. At least I can tell them apart. \n\nGray looks at his arm, and a digital screen comes to life. He taps at it with a crooked finger. \u201cReadings indicate heightened levels of cortisol and increased adrenal flow. Source: Fight or flight response. Biologically rational, but devoid of purpose.\u201d He looks at me, cocks his over-large head to the side. \u201cYou have neither the option to fight us or flee us, so it would be best to comply. Do you understand?\u201d\n\nMy jaw hangs open. I don\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t know what to do. Are these aliens really standing there reading me my Miranda Rights? \u201cAre you going to probe me?\u201d I ask. \u201cLike the movies?\u201d\n\nTeal blinks at me, his pupils dilating. \u201cNegative.\u201d He points to a vat. \u201cWe will break down your genetic tissue into usable material, harvesting your most compatible DNA strands while discarding the rest. It is for the greater good.\u201d\n\nI follow his finger to the tank, and now that I\u2019m right up against it, I can see clearly what\u2019s floating inside. My stomach twists into a knot. Inside of it is a human body. Everything from the man\u2019s waist down has been dissolved, and what\u2019s left of his intestines are dangling freely. \n\n\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no cause for concern,\u201d Teal says. He lumbers across the chamber to the metallic console that all the tubes are feeding into. \u201cYour disappearance will be accounted for. A clone will be deployed to resume your life, preventing suspicion and avoiding social disruption.\u201d \n\n\u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d I say, trying to ignore how faint I\u2019m starting to feel. \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me\u2026 to save humanity?\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d\n\nThe room spins. My chest gets tight and my vision becomes a scrambled mess. My ears are ringing like church bells. I stumble, losing my sense of equilibrium and I think I taste vomit in my throat.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I mutter. \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening\u2026 Can\u2019t be happening\u2026\u201d \n\nI steady myself against a vat, looking up to see a dead woman\u2019s face staring back at me. Pieces of her skull have been eaten away. I can see the wrinkles of her brain underneath.  \n\n\u201cHeart rate out of range,\u201d Gray says, but I hardly hear him. He grabs my wrist, presses a device against the center of my hand. \n\nI struggle. Fight. I try to use my teeth, but he\u2019s strong, much stronger than me. A coldness pulses against my palm, almost like an ice cube, and soon that frigid sensation is traveling across my fingertips. Up my arm. \n\n\u201cWhat did you\u2026\u201d I mutter, but the sensation is rolling through the rest of my body. It\u2019s soothing. My eyes find my palm and I see a strange shape seared into the skin, a scatter of dots surrounding a black square.  Suddenly I can\u2019t remember the thought I was trying to finish. Was any of this *really* worth panicking over? \n\nIt was just a few corpses in vats, after all. \n\n\u201cYou have been administered a sedative,\u201d Gray explains. \n\nMy heart rate slows. My ears stop ringing. The ghost of a smile sneaks across my face.\n\nGray\u2019s staring at his display. \u201cCortisol levels reduced. Adrenal response suppressed. Biometric readings indicate subject has achieved a suitable level of suggestibility to proceed.\u201d \n\n\u201cAffirmative,\u201d says Teal, working the console. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m drifting through the lake on a warm summer day. My heart is full. I\u2019m in absolute bliss, and all I can think is that Hope should get to experience this before she dies\u2026\n\n\u201cPulse is quickening,\u201d Gray says with a frown.\n\nHope.\n\nMy sister.\n\nMy dying sister, alone in the hospital wondering why her little brother abandoned her. \n\n\u201cSedation effect dropping,\u201d Gray says. \u201c98%. 94%. Emotional instability reaching unacceptable levels.\u201d\n\n\u201cHope,\u201d I sputter, feeling like I\u2019m coming out of a daze. \u201cI have to get to the hospital\u2013 please! My sister is sick! She needs me!\u201d\n\nGray presses the device against my other hand, and another pulse of relaxation courses through me. \u201cInvalid concern,\u201d he tells me. \u201cClone will be a perfect recreation of you, body and mind. It will retain all memories allowing it to continue your life uninterrupted. Conclusion: your expiring sibling will receive suitable emotional support prior to her decomposition.\u201d\n\nFucking aliens. It takes everything I have to fight against the sedative, to make my case. \u201cHow?\u201d I groan. \u201cHow is my DNA supposed to save humanity? What the hell is it saving us from anyway?\u201d\n\nTeal turns from the console to face us. His giant eyes are narrowed in a thoroughly displeased manner. \u201cInvalid request. Information too critical to risk dissemination.\u201d\n\n\u201cRebuttal,\u201d says Gray. \u201cClone\u2019s memory can be modified. Current biometric readings indicate high levels of emotional discontent, placing likelihood of a compromised harvest at 34%. Solution: permit subject to understand purpose of sacrifice. Result: sense of closure and enhanced probability of project success.\u201d\n\nTeal turns back to the console. \u201cRebuttal accepted. Proceed.\u201d\n\nGray looks at me. He places his scaly fingers against my head, and I squirm a little. \u201cBrace yourself for disorientation,\u201d he tells me. \u201cYou will experience physical unease and hyperstimulation. After, you will understand the horror that awaits your species in the dark.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a long time, that\u2019s as far as the nightmare gets. Gray prattles on that I\u2019m about to see the truth, some twisted fate that justifies melting humans into sludge, but before he can deliver the goods, I wake up. \n\nEvery. Time. \n\nBlue balls doesn\u2019t begin to describe it. \n\nLast night, it happens again. The nightmare, I mean. Same aliens, same tanks of human soup, but this time I wake up in a cold sweat. My phone is ringing on the bedside table. There\u2019s a name on the screen that I hate to see.\n\n\u201cWhatisit?\u201d I grumble. \n\n\u201cJesus Christ, Mitchell. I\u2019ve been calling for ten minutes!\u201d\n\nMy boss. Lisa. \n\nShe goes off. The words are coming out like machine-gun fire, and from the background chatter I figure she\u2019s speaking to more than just me. It sounds like there\u2019s a crowd around her, like she\u2019s briefing suits as she jogs down a hallway.\n\n\u201cGot all that?\u201d she asks. \n\nSomething about a shitstorm. Something about an F35. The air force just shot down a UAP, which is how we say UFO these days to avoid getting laughed out of the room. Apparently it happened in New Mexico. My backyard. \n\nThis calls for a liter of coffee. Maybe two. \n\nI stumble into the kitchen and put a pot on. I have some time while she holds the phone to her chest and barks orders at the drones around her. One cream. One sugar. My spoon clinks against the side of the mug as her voice blares through the speaker. \n\n\u201cMitchell?\u201d she says. \u201cStill there?\u201d\n\nShe says she\u2019s got coordinates. I take a sip of scalding java. I\u2019m dazed enough I barely feel it burn my tongue. My fingers punch the coordinates into my laptop, bringing up the location the supposed UAP was shot down. \n\nI spit my coffee over my screen. \n\n\u201cThe fuck?\u201d I mutter, leaning forward and doing a double take at the map. \n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she\u2019s asking.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I\u2019m saying. \n\nBut it\u2019s a lie. The truth is, the coordinates are a dead match for the forest where I had my waltz with psychosis thirty years ago. They\u2019re the coordinates from my dream. Right down to the rickety old bridge. \n\nI ask her if she\u2019s sure the numbers are correct.\n\n\u201cAm I sure?\u201d she snaps. \u201cLook, if you\u2019re asking me if this is another Chinese spy balloon then the answer is go fuck yourself. I\u2019ve been pulling my hair out for the past twenty minutes. This is the real deal, so suit up and get ready to go. I\u2019ve got a bird on the way.\u201d\n\nThe clock on my microwave reads 2:34 a.m. and my stomach is telling me to sort my life out. \u201cDo I have time for breakfast?\u201d I ask. \n\n*Click.*\n\nThe line goes dead. \n\nTwenty minutes later, a helicopter is landing on my lawn. I board it in a daze, and we take off in the direction of the crash like we\u2019re trying to outrun a cruise missile. I\u2019m watching the lights of the countryside drift by, and it occurs to me that from all the way up here, in the dead of night, they almost look like stars. \n\nI wonder how long it\u2019d take to snuff them out.\n\nHow long it\u2019d take to burn a whole galaxy to ashes?\n\nTo crush a universe in the palm of your hand?\n\nThings to consider. \n\nThe closer we get to the crash site, the worse my thoughts become. They\u2019re bordering on obsessive. I\u2019m tangoing with darkness. Radio chatter is coming through the com line, something about aliens and extraterrestrials, but all I\u2019m thinking about is controlling my bladder. \n\nI\u2019m drowning in hypotheticals. \n\nI\u2019m wondering what happens if I lose my mind between here and the crash site, what the protocols are, where they\u2019ll take me. Do I get the night off? The week?\n\n\u201cEverything okay, sir?\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s the co-pilot. She\u2019s turning in her seat and looking at me like I\u2019m having a medical emergency. \n\n\u201cYou look a bit pale,\u201d she tells me. \n\nMy muscles work overtime as I twist my mouth into a smile. \u201cNever better,\u201d I lie. \u201cHow far out are we?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwenty miles,\u201d she says with a reassuring grin. She turns back in her seat and I take the opportunity to let out an exhausted sigh. \n\nI close my eyes. Take a dozen deep breaths. \n\nHappy thoughts. \n\nI try to ignore how dry my mouth is, how badly my hands are shaking. I try to ignore the fact that every time I look down at my palms, I see that same scatter of dots, that same faded square that no doctor has been able to explain. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen scars like that,\u201d they tell me. \u201cHow\u2019d you get them?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know, I tell them.\n\nI don\u2019t know.\n\nBut I do.\n\nI\u2019ve known this entire time, probably, but I\u2019ve just been too terrified to accept it. I\u2019m not what I think I am\u2013 this world isn\u2019t what I think it is either. It\u2019s all of this that\u2019s making me want to curl into a ball. It\u2019s making me want to weep on the floor, to scream at the top of my lungs and pull my hair out with everything I have.\n\nIt\u2019s making me want to throw open the helicopter door, take a breath of fresh air and then plunge head-first into the dirt like a human turnip. And if I thought it was that easy, I might just do it. \n\nBut somehow, I know it isn\u2019t.\n\nI know it won\u2019t save me\u2013 won\u2019t save us, from what\u2019s coming. \n\nSee, last night I had the same dream I\u2019ve had for the last thirty years. The same abduction. The same aliens. But last night, I got to see the director\u2019s cut. The Extended Edition. Last night, when Gray told me he was going to show me just how fucked we all are, he actually came through. \n\nImagine that. \n\nWhat I saw was everything. \n\nI saw how all of this ends. How all of it began. What I saw is what\u2019s waiting for us in the black infinity of space. And the more that I think about it, the more I think it might be driving me mad. \n\n\u201cJust up ahead,\u201d says the pilot. \u201cTen minutes to touch down.\u201d\n\nEight minutes.\n\nFive. \n\n\u201cJesus,\u201d he says, at the three minute mark. \u201cAre you two seeing this?\u201d\n\nAnd up ahead is a plume of smoke, rising into the night sky. There\u2019s the faint flicker of fading fires, the haphazard glow of industrial lighting, and there, at the center of it all, is the unmistakable shape of something that shouldn\u2019t exist.\n\n\u201cThat\u2026 doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s from this planet\u2026\u201d the co-pilot mutters over the com line. \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the pilot replies, and his voice is shaking. \u201cIt doesn't.\u201d \n\nThey\u2019re right. They both are. What it looks like is something extra-terrestrial, something alien. It looks like something ripped straight from my worst nightmares.\n\nAnd really, that\u2019s just where I wish it had [stayed](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCryptid/).",

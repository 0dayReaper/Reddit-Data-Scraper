    "postText": "I exorcise spirits for a living. Be confident, or the Whisperlings will steal your soul.\n\nWe do not live alone in this world. Around us, just beyond the sight of what we are willing to believe is an uncharted, secret layer. A realer, more colorful world is just beyond the reach of all of us, and yet we choose not to believe.\n\nWe are surrounded by spirits. We are encircled by demons. By the bones and ruins of long dead things we don\u2019t believe in anymore.\n\nOnce upon a time the world was a more colorful place, back when we truly believed and could see it for what it was.\n\nBut now we tell ourselves the things beyond the veil do not exist. I suppose that is why it is called the veil, perhaps. Because we have chosen all but to forget the true world around us.\n\nI am a wanderer.\n\nI\u2019ve been traveling the world for a time now, helping when I can and keeping an open mind, witnessing the very things we have chosen to forget. Most are kind, gentle, curious beasts.\n\nBut some creatures of the world beyond the veil aren\u2019t. Some are malicious, deadly, villainous.\n\nIt\u2019s my duty to exorcize the malevolent. It\u2019s also my duty to do the same for the kind who know not what they do.\n\nThe trees whispered in the wind, and the fields rippled as if they were alive. There was nobody on the stretch of road for miles, though I had seen deer and hedgehogs greet me.\n\nThen there came a point in the journey where I began to see them. Small, bouncy little things that floated and frolicked in the wind. \u201cFascinating,\u201d I mused, retrieving my notebook, taking a sketch. \u201cWhisperlings.\u201d\n\nThe docile, cotton-like blobs flew about me, landing for seconds at a time and taking right off. They puffed up in size and shrank, approaching me for minutes, then leaving.\n\nI reached out into the veil then. I had heard stories about them, but never seen them out in the wild, moving.\n\n\u201c...don\u2019t forget to\u2026\u201d echoes. \u201c...have a great day!\u201d voices, in time. Yes, this was as I heard.\n\nWhisperlings, from what I gathered, were the plants of the other side. They fed on human thought, emotion, passively, traveling with the wind and gathering what they could. They did not think, nor knew where they would travel next.\n\nI liked them. They reminded me of my wanderings, journeying from one place to the next, walking along until something caught my attention.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d I whispered. Two white spheres drifted over to me.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d they whispered, picking it up.\n\nI journeyed on, and oddly, the farther I followed the path, the more they were. Sure, Whisperlings traveled in large groups of the dozens- but as I town emerged in the distance I noted hundreds if not thousands drifting in the wind, approaching the town.\n\nOne would think these beings would be attracted to civilization. After all- there is more thought, more personality to feed on.\n\nBut the opposite is true. The disbelief we as a people have upon the other side instead caused them to avoid places of people. No, something was up here. Something fishy. I would want- need to investigate further.\n\nSo I wandered, dancing with the whispering dandelions, until I found myself in the center of town.\n\nA woman approached me. \u201cYou don\u2019t look familiar.\u201d The place was small, and I assumed everybody knew one another. Especially here, in the country.\n\nI tucked my notebook away. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I extended a hand, and she shook it, \u201cI\u2019m just a wanderer.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you need a place to stay?\u201d she asked, making it her business to know. There was a certain glint in her eye, one that told me she had reason for me to stay. I nodded. \u201cWell that\u2019s just great! Stay at my little inn!\u201d\n\nWithout asking me further she practically dragged me over to a little place with a cafe on the first floor, and three guest rooms on the second. \u201cI don\u2019t exactly have money, sorry.\u201d\n\nShe frowned. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\nI laughed, and dug into my backpack. \u201cI do have,\u201d I found the thing I was looking for, \u201cchocolate.\u201d I offered it, but she didn\u2019t take it. \u201cNo? I can work, and I\u2019ll be back with pay, if you know anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can make a call.\u201d She nodded and walked away to a telephone. \u201cUh-huh. Farmland. Crows.\u201d She came back over. \u201cThere\u2019ll be someone here. Daphne.\u201c\n\nHalf an hour later a middle aged woman was at the door of the inn, and I introduced myself. She seemed nice, and even accepted the chocolate I offered.\n\nWithin the hour I was wandering the fields. It was a simple job; the field was large, and crows had recently been amassing, eating crops and harassing the farmhands.\n\nI would go out, repair the scarecrows, and, with a noisemaker- a little electronic box that made loud shaking sounds, scare away the crows.\n\nThis was when I noticed the horde of Whisperlings that had gathered above town. Thousands that increased in number, swirling in a spiral pattern, all seeming to center around the farm I was working on.\n\nThe light shone through them, illuminating an ordinary, happy day. But the longer I focused on the puffs of dandelion a sick feeling began to manifest in my core.\n\nI reached out into the ether, wondering why they were here. I only got a garbled mess of shouts and screams that sounded angry. The noise seemed to resemble the soft yet direct speech of my temporary employer, Daphne.\n\nThey didn\u2019t drift on the ground either, strangely. No, they were all caught up in the growing gray spiral in the sky, segments of Whisperlings rippling at a time.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d I shouted, finishing off the last of the crows. \u201cGet outta here!\u201d For a second, a cloud of Whisperlings drew themselves to me, echoing back my words.\n\nThis was odd. They were not often drawn to shouts and anger. No, they reflected and devoured the small yet truly genuine moments of joy and peace. Now, though, I started to wonder if they also had taken a liking to genuine anger, and fear.\n\nI marched back to the house in the sea of grain to report my job had been done.\n\nThere was a man sitting on the porch, watching the skies with a glassy emptiness in his eyes. \u201cHey!\u201d I shouted. \u201cWhere\u2019s Daphne? Finished the job!\u201d\n\nThe man continued to eerily stare at the sky, absent. He coughed aimlessly, and small yet distinct blobs were catapulted out into the skies. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 new.\u201d The man was pale, the energy being taken from him.\n\nThe whispering dandelions were clearly having some sort of effect, one I had never studied. No, they were only supposed to take a miniscule bit of energy, nothing one could really recognize.\n\nBut the blobs surrounded him, clinging to his clothes and swirling.\n\n\u201cThere you are!\u201d Daphne shouted, dress rustling in the wind. \u201cCome inside- don\u2019t mind him.\u201d\n\nI walked up the steps as she beckoned me forth. \u201cWho is he?\u201d\n\nShe grimaced, odd for the words she was about to say. \u201cMy husband,\u201d she revealed. \u201cHe\u2019s been like this for a while. The doctor\u2019s don\u2019t know why.\u201d Inside, safe from the storm of wind, she handed me the funds I so desperately needed. \u201cLot of use, them doctors.\u201d\n\nI studied her for a while. The tufts of white were swirling her, moreso, and yet she seemed full of energy, ranting about the doctors and the strange sickness which had befallen her husband. \u201cI could try to help,\u201d I offered. \u201cI\u2019m good with herbs.\u201d\n\nShe seemed surprised, jolting, and shook her head. \u201cNow, now, you\u2019re just a wanderer, Miss\u2026\u201d She extended a hand.\n\n\u201cMills, Aster Mills,\u201d I introduced, shaking her hand.\n\nWhisperlings seemed to burst from her clothes, gently drifting away. \u201cIt\u2019s not your business to get into.\u201d I reached into the ether then, hoping to find out why the couple seemed to attract the dandelion-kind.\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t working. The jumble of screams and noise the creatures were chanting overwhelmed me, and I fell in a daze. \u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked, bringing me up to a sofa. \u201cI\u2019ll get you tea.\u201d\n\nI sipped her tea with worry. I shuddered in something like fear as I again tried to reach out into her mind. The creatures were too loud.\n\nHer husband wandered into the room, ambling without a sense of direction. I reached into his and-\n\nNothing. There was cold, empty nothing.\n\nIt filled me with a sense of distinct, powerful emptiness. I shuddered in fear, wondering if I stayed here I would be in danger. \u201cHi,\u201d I murmured.\n\nHe didn\u2019t respond. The Whisperlings followed him inside, roaming the halls, all over the house.\n\nThe puffy beings feeded on our emotions, sure, but even at the size they were gathering in- it would take a hundred thousand more to wipe out someone\u2019s entire personality. I had heard cases, disputed of mass gatherings leaving entire towns blank, empty.\n\nThere was something up in town. I would need to investigate the matter further. But for now, I could do something about the horde- at least indoors.\n\nI settled my backpack on the floor and found myself a little red stone. I placed it on the ground and uttered some words.\n\nThe Whisperlings fled. The stone had that distinct ability. I hid it inside the couch.\n\nI told the woman, Daphne I wanted to leave then, and so she drove me back up the fields and farms, back to the little down they lived in. \u201cGreat place, this,\u201d she mused. \u201cGood food, good people, good values.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll be staying awhile longer,\u201d I told. \u201cHave you got more odd jobs?\u201d\n\nShe smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up tomorrow at nine if you want.\u201d\n\nI settled in bed, a book in front of me. A little bestiary of odd things beyond the veil my friend, Steven (may he rest in peace) had made for me. I flipped to the section about the Whisperlings.\n\n\u201cOdd,\u201d I whispered, watching the dandelion-blobs float outside. I turned my attention back to the book. Yes, there had been two cases of Whisperling gatherings wiping out the personality and mind of an entire town, feeding upon them until they were nothing more than husks.\n\nThe thought terrified me.\n\nBut the events documented took place over the course of a year, and with far more gathering in the skies. And our general disbelief in mysticism would hold defenses against being totally wiped out.\n\nAnd, if the Whisperlings were gathering here- why had only one man seemingly been affected.\n\nMy phone dinged. It was a good of friend of mine, Matt. I called him. \u201cHey Matt, how\u2019s it going?\u201d\n\nHis voice seemed distant, too far away. Clearly wherever he was, the signal wasn\u2019t one to be proud of. Or perhaps it was me. \u201cI\u2019m- near-\u201d static, \u201cAnthem City.\u201d We were both journeying separately, but that was where we would reconvene, and tell our tales. \u201cAbout a day away?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a week,\u201d I told. \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to look into here.\u201d He asked me what could be so important to delay our meeting. \u201cThere\u2019s an odd Whisperling gathering here- they\u2019re sucking the life out of a man.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you report it to the Company?\u201d The Company hunted, destroyed, and collected the bizarre. They were not a force to be trifled with.\n\nThey were also after us. Me and Matt, for our own [experiences](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13cci6c/i_sell_cursed_artifacts_for_a_living_theres_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) with the divine. \u201cCan\u2019t have them on our trail- plus, I think I can dispel this.\u201d\n\nHe sighed. \u201cIf you say so. Has Quentin contacted you?\u201d I shook my head. We chatted a bit more of cursed artifacts, divine things, and beyond the veil.\n\nI fell asleep soon, watching the Whisperlings glow a soft gray in the night. Hypnotic.\n\nWhen I woke there was a dozen Whisperlings in my room, gently dancing about. \u201cHello there,\u201d I whispered. They didn\u2019t echo my words, oddly. They were supposed to echo my words. \u201cOdd.\u201d\n\nI changed and found myself at the cafe downstairs. I ordered an omelet and paid for it.\n\nThe woman in charge came up to me. \u201cHow long do you plan on staying?\u201d\n\n\u201cA day or two longer,\u201d I informed, handing over the last bits of money I had left. This was when my eye caught the window- for outside, all over the town were Whisperlings, as if we had been caught in a blizzard. \u201cMy god.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d puzzled the woman, looking outside. She saw nothing. \u201cWhat\u2019d you see?\u201d\n\n\u201cA cardinal, red,\u201d I lied. \u201cI like to watch birds.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too!\u201d And then I had to listen to her drone on and on about birds. I had no vested interest in the topic, and when Daphne came to pick me up, I was more that happy.\n\nThe gray, furry globs drifted to the sides as we drove. They were falling from the skies today, drifting downwards slowly and swooping back up. I reached into the ether. The screams that sounded oddly like the woman seemed more pronounced, real.\n\nI decided to ask about it. \u201cHey, Daphne, is anything going on at home?\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides my husband\u2019s illness?\u201d she pondered. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThe screams of the Whisperlings concerned me. \u201cAre you sure? I have contacts if\u2026\u201d\n\nShe frowned at me, something like malice. \u201cNothing\u2019s going on. I don\u2019t need you getting in on my business.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d I answered. \u201cI\u2019ll stick to my thing from now on- what do you need help with?\u201d\n\nWe stopped, I followed her in, and she handed me a jug of weed killer. \u201cThere\u2019s some weeds in the back garden- spray them.\u201d\n\nI nodded, took the jug and headed back to the garden. It was large, expansive, and old greenhouses and ruined statues awaited me. It seemed like the ruins of an ancient civilization, and had I not been given a job, I would have sketched it.\n\nDrifting softly, the Whisperlings entered the house, streams of round gray entering the house. Clearly, the enchantment I had cast had done nothing to deter them.\n\nI seized one and spoke to it. \u201cReveal to me your secrets, I say, in the name of the Painter.\u201d It was strong, and didn\u2019t seem to be affected by the spell. Or perhaps it was because Whisperling\u2019s didn\u2019t possess conscious thought, and thus could not \u2018reveal\u2019 its secrets.\n\nYes, it was the latter. I started to spray the weed killer on the plants she\u2019d pointed out.\n\nIt was about a half hour later when the Whisperlings started to pick up in speed. Instead of gentle streams they came in waves, hundreds at a time trying to fit themselves into the house.\n\nSomething was clearly going on. I reached into the ether- they were feeding.\n\nStealthily, I crept back to the house, as quiet as the hidden folk. And then I began to hear voices there, reflected off the Whisperlings, a thousand fractal yells, one over the other.\n\nThe door was open. I crept inside and listened to the couple in the kitchen.\n\n\u201cYou good for nothing man,\u201d Daphne hissed, something falling to the floor. \u201cYou were always like this!\u201d I crept closer, and when I found a satisfactory closeness I reached into the ether, and projected my mind.\n\nShe was holding something up- a rolling pin in one hand and raising it above her husband, who, cowering in the corner, could only sob.\n\nHe didn\u2019t speak. Whisperlings swarmed them, ever present, yet invisible. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been like this.\u201d She slammed the pin on the counter. \u201cCan\u2019t do anything right!\u201d She slammed it again.\n\nThe Whisperlings began to feed- not entirely on the words she spoke- but of the man. \u201cYou\u2019re not worth my time.\u201d And she threw the pin on the floor, rolling away as she walked towards-\n\nI backed into a corner, avoiding her. I was right. Something was happening. The Whisperlings weren\u2019t feeding on the woman- but the man.\n\nOur mental guard protects us from being devoured by Whisperlings and other creatures alike. This man- I reached into the ether, had lost all sense of self, once I was slowly understanding not from the Whisperling storm- but from his wife.\n\nWith a clearer picture, I could reach deeper. Yes, this had happened numerous times- what had started a happy marriage devolved as the woman grew bored and greedy, wanting a life beyond the town.\n\nAnd the man suffered for it, caring- yet only being able to provide what he could on the farm.\n\nSpirits have reasons for feeding. For being attracted to certain people. For me, it was attraction to the weirder world.\n\nFor the man- he was easy prey. Someone with no confidence, no self worth.\n\nI heard footsteps. \u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d Daphne said, a sickly sweet in her voice. \u201cLet me get your money.\u201d She left.\n\nThere was one way to remove the Whisperling infestation. To remove the source of the problem to begin with- to rebuild the man\u2019s self-worth. To do this I would need to cut Daphne out of the equation for good.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s your money, dear,\u201d she spoke, handing me a wad of cash. \u201cNow, hop along and I\u2019ll drive you back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d I paused, slinging my back over and digging in, \u201cI would like to show you something.\u201d I looked through my compartments- a magic stone here, enchanted salts there- ah- there it was.\n\nA small pocket river, closed. It was gold on the outside, and strange symbols rimmed its sides. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nI touched the symbols and whispered to them. \u201cEscobath\u2019s Mirror,\u201d I muttered, handing it to her. An artifact I had recovered from black market dealers so long ago. \u201cTake a look.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s-\u201d she opened and observed. And screamed. And screamed more. The mirror wasn\u2019t cursed, nor did demons possess it; the artifact revealed the morals of those who witnessed, the weight of good and evil. \u201cIs this-\u201d\n\nIt also struck a deep want to change. I took the mirror back. \u201cThis is who you have become.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to become that- that thing.\u201d It struck me as funny. The reflection showed you who you were. They didn\u2019t have to believe it- and yet, all who saw- did.\n\nI had never seen my own. Perhaps it was for the best. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to change,\u201d I mused. \u201cYou aren\u2019t happy here- leave.\u201d\n\nShe drove me back to the inn and I waited. She, in her confusion, had given me more money than I should have been paid. I opted not to tell her, and to stay the week.\n\nShe left the following day. I heard from the inn owner. That was the same day the Whisperlings began to drift away, softly in the wind.\n\nBy the end of the week there were barely any left to stay, only the tamest of ones, feeding purely off of the tiniest reflections of who we were. I assumed this was a good thing; the man, with less in his way of life, had recovered.\n\nPerhaps not fully. The images I had witnessed would take years to recover from. But even the tiniest ounce of identity, self, would be away to deter the Whisperlings.\n\n\u201cWill you be coming back?\u201d the innkeeper inquired.\n\nI smiled, and shrugged, handing her a tip and an enchanted stone for good luck. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\nI pondered on that. Where were any of us truly headed? \u201cNowhere. I\u2019m just a wanderer.\u201d She looked at me funnily. \u201cBut I believe I have a friend to meet in Anthem City.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Encounter #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13pc316/i_hunt_monsters_for_a_living_in_the_slums_of_the/)",

    "postText": "2023.01.17\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m writing this diary because there\u2019s a possibility I\u2019m going crazy. I might\u2019ve suffered a severe memory loss today. I don\u2019t even know where to start.\r  \n\t\r  \nI remember being in a middle of a tall, dark forest with my best friend, Scott. The problem is, I have no idea how I got there. I remember going to sleep yesterday, but I don\u2019t know what happened afterward.  \r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cHey, Scott. What the fuck are we doing here?\u201d I asked him.\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cNo idea, mate,\u201d he shook his head in shock. \u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t even remember what I did a few minutes ago. The last thing I remember is\u2026 is yesterday evening, when I went to sleep.\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cYeah, same. What the fuck is going on?\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cAre we drugged?\u201d Scott glanced at me.\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cNo, my head is 100% clear, I just don\u2019t remember anything from today. Let\u2019s just\u2026 get back home, eh?\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cSomeone\u2019s missing.\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cWhat?\u201d I raised my eyebrows.\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cI feel like\u2026 there should be someone else here\u2026 with us. But I don\u2019t remember who.\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \nAs he said this, I had the same feeling. I still don\u2019t remember how we got into that forest, but there were three of us. Me, Scott\u2026 and someone else, but for fuck\u2019s sake, I can\u2019t remember who. We later went back to our homes and texted a few common friends if they know something, but they all thought we were just drunk or high (or both).\r  \n\t\r  \nNeedless to say, I\u2019m not getting any sleep today, it\u2019s already past midnight, and my thoughts are keeping me awake.\r  \n\t\r  \n\r  \n2023.01.19\r  \n\r  \n\t\r  \nToday I went to a pub with Scott to talk about this strange incident with each other. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cLook, first we have to know who was the third person with us,\u201d Scott said.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAre you sure there was a third person? I mean, I remember the same, but maybe it\u2019s just our minds playing games with us.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m sure. It\u2019s like I can almost name the guy, but I just can\u2019t remember his name or appearance.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n \u201cOkay, then\u2026 I don\u2019t know, let\u2019s look through our high school classmates, we met most of our common friends there, so\u2026\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cGood idea, mate, good idea.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nLuckily, I had the list of our classmates saved on my phone, so I opened the file and started reading the names.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t talked to him since our graduation, no, not her either, she\u2019s in Japan,\u201d Scott kept shaking his head as he read the names. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t any of them,\u201d I said as we finished the list.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cBut wait,\u201d Scott interrupted. \u201cThere are 22 names on your list. We had 23 students in our class.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cTrue,\u201d I responded. He was right. I remembered it, too. It was impossible to forget, 23 students, and 24 chairs in the classroom, we kept one more just in case we broke one. \u201cBut who\u2019s missing from the list?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWe sat there for like an hour, trying to remember our 23rd classmate from high school, but we just\u2026 forgot who it was. \r  \n\r  \nNow it\u2019s evening, and I\u2019m home again, browsing through my friends on social media, trying to find our missing classmate. Now I\u2019m sure it was him. Our 23rd classmate. He was the one with us in the forest.\r  \n\r  \n2023.01.20\r  \n\r  \nScott called me today.\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cMorning, mate. Look, remember when in high school, we were walking home, and a homeless guy randomly offered to sell us cigarettes?\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cHah, yeah, I remember,\u201d I laughed. \u201cAnd we bought\u2026\u201d I had to stop for a few seconds to catch my breath. \u201cWe bought\u2026 three cigarettes.\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cExactly. Who was the third person with us?\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cMate, it\u2019s fucking crazy. It\u2019s like our friend just erased himself from reality. Like he never existed.\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cIs that even possible?\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cI don\u2019t know, mate. This past few days\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\n\n2023.01.24\r  \n\r  \n\t\r  \nThis morning, Scott knocked on my door. \r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cHey, Scott,\u201d I greeted him. \u201cWhat\u2019s up? Did you find something?\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cLook, we have to get back to that forest,\u201d he said. To be honest, I thought it was a bad idea, so I tried to convince him otherwise.\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cScott, just, no.\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cMate, I\u2019m sure that guy was a friend of ours. And something happened to him. Something made him vanish from the past and present. And I think we both know that the last time we might\u2019ve seen him was in that forest. Something happened there. Something terrible. We must find out. For him.\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cScott, listen. If he even existed, like\u2026 ever, and something erased him from existence, whatever it was, a cosmic power, an alien, a witch, or the devil himself\u2026 then it can do the same to us. If we suffer the same fate\u2026\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cHe is our friend!\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cWe don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s real!\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cI had two best friends for years. You and him. I\u2019m 100% sure.\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cJust as I am,\u201d I responded. He was right. The three of us were best friends, and still, we don\u2019t remember anything about the third guy. Even if there was no hope to bring him back anymore, our curiosity proved to be more powerful than our survival instincts. Who or what is so powerful it can erase someone like this?\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the forest tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\r  \n\r\n\n2023.01.25\r  \n\r  \n\t\r  \nOkay, so right now, we\u2019re in that forest, I\u2019m waiting here while Scott is inside a cave. He told me to write down everything while he\u2019s inside.\r  \n\t\r  \nWe walked back to the exact place where we regained our memories more than a week ago. Scott quickly noticed a narrow, dark cave, leading somewhere under the ground.\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cIt seems familiar,\u201d I said.\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cYeah. If you ask me, I think we were inside that cave before.\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go inside, right?\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cI have to do it. I want to know what happened to him. Stay here and write down everything in your journal.\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cIf you want to go there, I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \n\u201cNo. If I\u2026\u201d he stopped and closed his eyes for a few seconds. \u201cIf I get erased\u2026 like him\u2026 you have to tell everyone what happened. Your journal is the proof. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll come back before you notice.\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \nSo yeah, I\u2019m sitting at the entrance of the cave, waiting for him to come back. I hope he does. Oh god, I hope he comes back. \r  \n\r  \n2023.01.26\r  \n\r  \nFuck, fuck, fuck.\r  \n\t\r  \nI just couldn\u2019t write anything more yesterday, \u2018cause I just couldn\u2019t process what happened. I\u2019m still doubting my sanity. Maybe\u2026 maybe I\u2019m just crazy. That would be much easier to accept. \r  \n\t\r  \nOne minute, I just found myself in the forest, sitting at the entrance of a cave, and had no idea how I got there. After a few minutes of thinking, I just went back home. Then I found a journal in my backpack. It\u2019s probably mine. It\u2019s my writing, and\u2026 it looks like it had already happened once on the 17th of January. I wrote it down, and I somehow still forgot about it until I read the journal.\r  \n\t\r  \nI read the whole thing. And I was writing about my best friend Scott in every entry. I never had a friend called Scott. At least, I don\u2019t remember. For fuck\u2019s sake, [what is happening?](https://www.reddit.com/r/polgari/)",

I never saw him again, and most people told me I imagined the whole scenario. I also don't remember his name, or his appearance, and as of now I was believing when people told me it was an imaginary friend or something.\n\nThe problem: I **do remember** everything we did, up to the point where I was asking myself \"who am I waiting for?\" - so, whatever it is erasing people's memories, it's getting stronger - erasing whole events? It's kinda scary....",

One day in high school we went to play dnd and had a fairly large party, so it was easier to just count who was at the table to know if we were all there. The count was supposed to be 7, but there were 6. I KNOW it was supposed to be 7, but no one knew what I was talking about. I told them someone's missing but nobody believed me. I forgot about the whole thing until a school dance later that semester. Our group of friends were all on the floor having a good time when I suddenly had this very deep feeling that someone was missing. I still don't know who that person is, or even what gender they were. I still occasionally get that feeling but it's died down over the years. One day I fear I will forget completely.",

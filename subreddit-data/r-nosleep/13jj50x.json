    "postText": "It was the last day of fall, the very last brown leaves rattling on the oaks lining the back hill. I\u2019d been out fixing a spot where the fire road had started to fall away.\n\nThe property is sixty acres, most of it wild and crowded with ticks and poison oak. Even though I\u2019ve lived here twenty years, there are places I\u2019ve never walked. When I bought the land, I heard there was a spring somewhere up the mountain where the deer gather, but I\u2019ve never seen it.\n\nAs you might guess, I lived way the hell out of town, past the point where even the main roads turn to gravel, and then to dirt. Never once have I seen another person here, unless I invited them, and I didn\u2019t hand out too many invitations.\n\nI was just finishing up work when I spotted something strange in the nearby brush\u2013a flash of orange. At first, I thought it might be a fallen leaf, still holding on to its last bits of color, but as I looked closer, I saw it was bigger: a hunting vest.\n\nI called out a \u201chello\u201d and got no response. I cursed and spat, wishing I\u2019d brought my shotgun. It wouldn\u2019t have been impossible for some lost hiker on the PCT to end up here, or some drifter wandering for miles out of town.\n\nI called out again and was met with silence. The cold wind rattled the leaves. I could tell snow was on the way.\n\nI could have left it there, of course, but it was my land after all. Slowly, I approached the orange thing. Then, as I reached it, I almost gagged. What I found was a body, fully intact except for the head, which was missing. There was no pool of blood, though.\n\nStupidly, I bent closer and saw something that made me gag.\n\nWhere there should have been a bloody stump, I instead found smooth skin covering the entirety of the severed neck. It was as if the body had been born headless with clean, unscarred skin covering the top of the neck where the head would normally go.\n\nThe first snowflakes of winter began to fall against my back as I tried to figure out what to make of this impossible corpse. I had no way of knowing how long it had been there. It seemed fresh, maybe due to the cold weather. The hands were cool to the touch. Pale and drained of blood. But they didn\u2019t show any signs of rot.\n\nOddly though, when I rolled up the sleeve, the skin looked slightly darker than the hand, almost like they belonged to two different people. I turned the boldly slightly to look at the other arm. It was yet another color, none of it matching.\n\nI told myself maybe it was a weird tan. Maybe he\u2019d been wearing gloves at some point or a one-sleeved shirt. Maybe he\u2019d had some kind of illness.\n\nI could have left the body there. But that would likely mean leaving it for the duration of the winter\u2013three or four months under a few feet of snow. And who knows what condition it would be in when that time was over?\n\nI probably should have called the county sheriff, but there were a few plants on my land I didn\u2019t want him to see, not to mention some code violations. Finally, I decided that I\u2019d be best off bringing the thing back to the house and disposing of it later, probably dumping it in a park somewhere so that it could be discovered by somebody else.\n\nWith some effort, I hauled the body over to a cart I\u2019d hooked onto my 4-wheeler. Then I hauled ass back to the main house before the snow started to stick.\n\nI had an uninsulated basement attached to the house, only accessible by a single staircase through the kitchen. It mostly kept the pests outs and was good for storing some tools and a few dry goods. I dragged the body into there for the night, where it could stay cold but would be protected from the elements, not to mention the bears.\n\nThen I washed up and heated up a can of red beans on my cook stove before settling in to watch the news. The sick thought occurred to me that this was my first time having company in a few years.\n\nMaybe an hour passed, and I got to drinking. Then, as I was heading to the kitchen for a another beer, I thought I heard something. A little thump, followed by a kind of dragging sound.\n\nOf course, being out in the woods, animals were jumping on the roof all the time, but this sound had come from below. And if I\u2019m being honest, seeing the body had set me a little on edge, even if I didn\u2019t want to admit it.\n\nI picked up my shotgun and walked slowly to the basement door, trying not to make a sound. I was trying to breathe slow, like in those yoga videos they advertise on the home shopping network.\n\nPeering down the stairs, I could barely see the body\u2019s two feet near the bottom of the stairs. Except that I could have sworn I left the body clear down at the other side of the room.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d I called down into the darkness. \u201cHello?\u201d\n\nThere was no response, of course. So I shut the door and started back toward the living room. Outside, the snow was falling harder now, piling up on the dirt road. By morning, I\u2019d be here for the duration, on my own until the March thaw. The sun began to slip over the far mountains, throwing a shadow over everything, almost like night.\n\nBefore I could sit back down again, I heard another thump. And then another. I walked back to the door, but something in me refused to open it this time. Instead, I locked it. As I did, I heard a few more thumps, each one growing closer. And then the handle began to rattle.\n\nI took a step back. And then another as the rattling began to grow more urgent.\n\n\u201cGo away!\u201d I shouted. \u201cGet!\u201d\n\nBut whatever it was didn\u2019t listen. Loud kicks began to sound from the bottom of the door, where the wood was beginning to buckle and splinter.\n\nI leveled my gun at the door and fired.\n\nThen I heard several thumps as something fell down the stairs. For a moment, I just stood there. I definitely wasn't doing any yoga breathing now. My heart was going so fast that it sent a tingle down my left arm.\n\nFor a moment, everything was silent. My ears rang from the shotgun blast and the air reeked of gunpowder.\n\nThen, I began to hear the thumps again. First one, then another as the thing made its way back up the stairs.\n\nPart of me wanted to shoot it again, to stand my ground. To defend my castle.\n\nBut then I thought better of the idea.\n\nIf one shotgun blast through the door didn\u2019t finish the thing, I figured a second shot wasn\u2019t going to do much better.\n\nSo for the first time in my life, I ran.\n\nI sprinted to the four-wheeler and unhitched the cart. As I did, I looked up into the house where I saw the thing standing there. As I watched, it walked across the living room and sat down in the chair I\u2019d occupied just a few minutes earlier. If it had eyes, I supposed it would have watched TV.\n\nI drove through the storm. There were a few hairy moments, but for the most part I didn\u2019t hit much trouble. The whole time, though, I couldn\u2019t stop looking over my shoulder. As if the thing were sprinting after me, running blindly through the snow, like it would catch me any second.\n\nFinally, when I hit the main road, I felt like I could breathe again. I didn\u2019t stop driving until I was all the way downtown.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why, but the first thing I did was to walk into the most crowded bar I could find and order a beer. It\u2019s funny\u2013it had been maybe six months since the last time I\u2019d talked to anyone, but suddenly it was all I wanted to do. And for the next few hours, I flapped my gums at anyone who would listen, telling every story I knew, every one except the one I\u2019m telling you now.\n\nI never did go back to the property. I sold it to some rich man from California. I heard he demolished my old cabin, put in some kind of metal and glass fortress. Maybe that\u2019ll keep him safe. As for me, I don\u2019t ever plan on living out there again. Especially after what happened to my neighbor, Kevin.\n\nSee, a few nights after I left, the sheriff got a frantic call from Kevin\u2019s wife, who had been out of town. She\u2019d just gotten back to her house during a break in the weather. When she did, she found her husband\u2019s body. Except it was missing a head. According to the coroner it had been ripped off its body.\n\nOf course, they said it was a bear. But what kind of bear just takes a head and leaves the rest of the kill untouched, uneaten?\n\nI\u2019ve got no idea what the thing wanted with a severed head. Maybe it was just jealous. Maybe it wanted to wear it like a hat.\n\nAnd then I remember the way those skin tones didn\u2019t match on the arms and hands. I wonder, maybe, if the thing started as nothing at all. If it slowly put itself together out of all the lonely old men in the woods, all the guys like me that thought we didn\u2019t need anyone.\n\nAt night, I imagine a lot of things. I imagine my own neck ripping at the seams. And then I have to force myself out of bed. I sprint out into the street, running and running until I see another human being. Desperate to talk to anyone, willing to do anything for a little company. [Anything to not be alone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)",

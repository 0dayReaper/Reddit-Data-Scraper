    "postText": "I\u2019ve never been that active. But recently, after a health scare, I\u2019ve decided to get in shape. The gym is boring, so I\u2019ve started running down trails in the woods. Narrow paths winding next to a babbling brook, birds chirping in the trees, the smell of dirt and fresh air\u2014it\u2019s exhilarating.\n\nBut today, that all came to an end.\n\nI was taking a jog down a new path I hadn\u2019t been down before. As I came around the bend, my toe caught on something. I flew through the air and fell into the dirt, my hands flying out in front of me a second before I hit the ground.\n\nPain shot up my elbows and knees. Wincing, I slowly pulled myself up.\n\nAnd there it was. The thing that I\u2019d tripped on.\n\nA piece of clothing.\n\nI stepped forward, my heart pounding in my chest. It was a denim jacket, twisted and rolled on itself, the indigo blue now a muddy brown as it was slowly reclaimed by nature. It wasn\u2019t the weirdest thing I\u2019d found in the woods, by far. I\u2019d seen beer bottles, crumpled paper, even an old baseball cap. I straightened, glancing around the forest\u2014\n\nAnd something else caught my eye.\n\nJust several yards off the trail, there was something white, sticking out against the muted greens and browns of the forest.\n\nMy breath caught in my throat.\n\nSlowly, I stepped off the trail. Ferns brushed my calves as I made my way through the underbrush. I winced at the thought of how many ticks were probably latching on to my legs, but I continued. As I got closer, and my brain still couldn\u2019t parse what the white shape was. I just knew by the color, by the shape, it didn\u2019t belong in the woods.\n\nI took another step\u2014\n\nAnd froze.\n\nNext to the shape was a mess of tangled, dark hair.\n\n*It\u2019s a body.*\n\nI began to scream. No one could hear me\u2014I was a few miles from the road, from any houses\u2014but I couldn\u2019t help it. I screamed and screamed and screamed until I was out of breath.\n\nThe woman was lying face down in the underbrush. The ferns and long grasses had grown up around her, nearly engulfing her entire body. There was no smell; she\u2019d probably been here a while. And the white I\u2019d seen\u2014it was the white of her t-shirt, poking up through the foliage.\n\n*Oh my God. What do I do?* My hyperventilating breaths echoed in the empty clearing. *Call the police. Right.* I pulled out my phone\u2014\n\nI stopped.\n\nA few feet away from the body, laying in the tall grass, was a shoe. I took a step in its direction\u2014and my entire body seized up as it came into full view.\n\n*It\u2019s my shoe.*\n\nIt was identical. A pink Nike sneaker, with white laces and a silver swoop logo. I swallowed, but my throat was dry. *It\u2019s a popular sneaker. So this woman wore them. So what? Doesn\u2019t mean anything.*\n\nExcept\u2026\n\nI turned back to the body.\n\nThe woman had long, dark, wavy hair. She was wearing black leggings and a white t-shirt\u2014like I often wore. Like I was wearing, *right now.* The ground spun underneath me. *Just a coincidence. Just\u2026 a\u2026 coincidence.*\n\nBut I had to know.\n\nSlowly, I crouched down. I grabbed a stick near my foot and raised it to the woman\u2019s neck. Nearly gagging, I carefully lifted a lock of hair to expose the gray, desiccated skin of the woman\u2019s neck.\n\n*No.*\n\nA faded tattoo of a cross stared back at me.\n\n*She has my tattoo. She has my fucking tattoo.*\n\nI leapt back. My heel hit uneven ground and I lost my balance. I fell, rear-first, onto the damp dirt. Staring at the corpse, at the tangled mess of hair.\n\n*It can\u2019t\u2026 it can\u2019t\u2026*\n\nI forced myself up. Tore my eyes away and sprinted back through the ferns, back to the trail. I ran as fast as I could, my entire body burning. My lungs ached with each breath. But all I could think about was running.\n\nGetting away from the body.\n\nWhen I turned the bend, I saw a man walking down the trail. Earbuds in, getting exercise. I thought about telling him what I\u2019d seen. But I couldn\u2019t stop the panic. Couldn\u2019t stop running, putting as much distance between me and that *thing* as possible.\n\nBut then the strangest thing happened.\n\nIn that last split-second, before I passed the man\u2014\n\nI saw him smile.\n\nI glanced back. He had stopped in the middle of the trail. And was looking over his shoulder at me, smiling.\n\n*What the\u2026*\n\nI pumped my legs harder. Glanced back again.\n\n*No.*\n\nHe had turned around. And was starting after me.\n\nPanic flooded me. I forced myself to run harder. But I could hear his steps behind me, pounding on the dirt trail. Getting louder by the second.\n\nThe body in the woods flashed through my head. Face down. Overgrown with foliage. Sunken and gray.\n\nForgotten.\n\nI glanced behind me. He was running at me\u2014but not gaining on me as fast as I thought. I forced myself to push forward. Around another bend. And then, through an opening in the trees, I saw it.\n\nThe parking lot.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t empty.\n\nA family was getting ready to take a walk on the trail. And they could see us. \u201c*Help!\u201d* I screamed. *\u201cHelp me!\u201d*\n\nA flurry of movement as the father pulled out his phone and called the police, while the mother ushered the kids back inside the car. I glanced back to see the man scurrying off into the underbrush, trying to hide.\n\nBut it was too late for him.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe police identified the man as a local who\u2019d been accused of stalking women before. They were able to find him in the woods and bring him in to custody.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t find a body.\n\nI revisited the spot several weeks later. And while I was certain that was the exact spot, there was no body. Just the ferns, swaying in the breeze, dappled by early summer sunlight.",

    "postText": "My name is Evaline and my sister who is vital to this as well is named Vivian and we are twins aged twenty-three. Yesterday we went on a graveyard investigation, and I don't think we came back alone.\r  \nWe pulled up to the graveyard In Vivians beat up red bug. She shut off the car and looked over to me. \r  \n\u201cI have a weird feeling, Evaline, are you sure you want to do this?\u201d asked Vivian.\r  \n\u201cOh yeah everyone keeps telling me about this place!\u201d I exclaimed. \r  \nAs we exited the car and walked up to the property Vivian turned on the ghost box (A tool used for communicating with ghosts by scanning through radio frequencies and white noise).\r  \nThe ghost box said one word very abruptly \u201cSTOP.\u201d \r  \nWe looked at each other with puzzled faces. \r  \n\u201cDo you not want us here?\u201d asked Vivian. \r  \n\u201cSTOP.\u2019 Came through the ghost box again. \r  \n\u201cUh color me crazy but I think we should still go in.\u201d I said. \r  \nVivian looked at me for a moment and then agreed we heard one final \u201cSTOP.\u201d as we entered and then it was dead silent for 15 minutes. \r  \nWe were walking around when my sister Vivian stopped and looked at a specific tree. This tree is twisted looking literally it has two parts to it that twist together to make sort of an arch way. \r  \n\u201cA woman is over there.\u201d Vivian whispered and pointed towards the tree (Vivian Is a medium by the way)\r  \n\u201cWell let\u2019s go check It out.\u201d I enthusiastically said. \r  \nAs we reached the tree the ghost box said the name \u201cANNIE.\u201d \r  \nVivian Greeted Annie and asked her why she was there. \r  \nBut I was more Interested In trying to find Annie\u2019s headstone. \r  \n\u201cHey, ask her for her last name!\u201d I shouted over to Vivian who gave me a thumbs up.\r  \nI walked further away scanning all the different headstones with my flashlight. Some of these guys are really old, like 17th century old. \r  \n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s so haunted.\u201d I thought to myself.\r  \nAs I looked up to scan the next headstone, I saw a figure of a man standing by a headstone. \u201cHoly shit where'd he come from?\u201d I thought \u201cHey Vivian do you see hi-\u201d I cut off because when I pointed back to where I saw him no one was there.\r  \n\u201cOkaayyy.\u201d I said in a hushed tone \u201cI\u2019m just going to go walk over there and see what the headstone says.\u201d I made my way over to the headstone.\r  \n \u201cOh no way Vivian come over here, look who I found!\u201d I shouted \r  \n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, what'd you find?\u201d Vivian asked excitedly.\r  \nShe looked down as I shined my flashlight on the fading stone the words \u201cAnnie Forester Beloved Mother and Wife\u201d were shown. \r  \n\u201cME.\u201d Said the ghost box We both looked at each other. We normally don\u2019t get very intelligent responses so this was a big deal. \r  \n\u201cWhat happened to you Annie?\u201d I asked \u201cHUNG.\u201d \r  \n\u201cOh Jesus, that took a dark turn.\u201d I said \r  \n\u201cEvaline, stop it.\u201d Vivan shouted, \"Can you tell us why?\u201d she asked, \r  \n\u201cWITCH.\u201d\r  \n\u201cOh she must have been a part of the old witch hunts that happened all through England and Ireland.\u201d Vivian said \r  \n\u201cYeah but why are you still here Annie?\u201d I asked Nothing happened for a good five minutes before the response \r  \n\u201cTO PROTECT\u201d came through.\r  \n\u201cProtect what Annie?\u201d I asked another few minutes pass by before the ghost box says \u201cTHE LAND\u201d\r  \n \u201cHuh that's awfully sweet of you do you make sure the living are safe?\u201d Asked Vivian \r  \n\u201cYES\u201d the ghost box replied almost Immediately \r  \n\u201cLEAVE\u201d It says.\r  \n\u201cWhy do you want us to leave?\u201d I asked \r  \n\u201cYeah what's wrong Annie?\u201d Asked Vivian\r  \n\u201cHIM\u201d\r  \n\u201cWho is him?\u201d Asked Vivian\r  \n\u201cPLEASE GO\u201d \r  \nThose were the last words the ghost box said for another twenty minutes\r  \n\u201cMaybe we should go, it's been a while and we haven't gotten anything else.\u201d Said Vivian\r  \nI Looked around the graveyard I had a bad feeling\r  \n\u201cYeah lets get outta here this place is starting to creep me out.\u201d I said as I stood and shook myself off trying to get rid of the odd energy.\r  \nWe packed up all of our things and headed to the entrance. We said a prayer so nothing negative would follow us and threw our bags in the trunk. As I opened the door I slumped down In the passenger seat. \r  \n\u201cPhew.\u201d I breathed \r  \n\u201cWe got some pretty good stuff from Annie. I just wanna know who the mysterious him is.\u201d Giggled Vivian\r  \nThe drive home was uneventful but I couldn\u2019t shake that odd energy from my body.\r  \n\u201cHey Viv do you feel weird or is that just a me thing?\u201d I asked looking over at Vivian\r  \n\u201cMmm yeah ever since we left I felt odd, hopefully it's just our nerves.\u201d Vivian said with a warm smile. But something was hidden behind the warmth of her smile : fear.\r  \nWe pulled up to the house and unloaded our bags onto the kitchen table. It's become sort of a ritual at this point, every time we finish an investigation we unpack and load in all the recordings to listen to with high quality noise canceling headphones. We also order some kind of takeout tonight's meal of champions was Chinese food my favorite.\r  \nI stirred together my orange chicken and rice as I pawed through the recordings settling on the third one when Annie mentions \u201cHIM\u201d. The recording fills my ears as I intently listen.\r  \n\u201cLEAVE.\u201d Says the ghost box \r  \n\u201cWhy do you want us to leave?\u201d you can hear us asking\r  \n\u201cHIM\u201d the ghost box says \r  \n\u201cWho is him?\u201d Vivian\u2019s voice says\r  \nI listen closely as silence fills the space \r  \n\u201cI'm Him.\u201d A deep voice says not over the voice box but right next to the recorder.\r  \nI screamed and jumped out of my seat throwing the headphones on the ground.\r  \n\u201cWhat what what!\u201d Says Vivian\r  \n\u201cOh hell no, that sounded like satan.\u201d I said laughing In disbelief\r  \nI rewinded the recording so Vivian could hear it. I saw her face turn into a huge grin.\r  \n\u201cNow this is solid stuff we have to go back there!\u201d Exclaimed Vivian\r  \n\u201cYeah I'm down but you're reviewing the tapes next time that voice is creepy.\u201d I said with a smile\r  \n\u201cDeal!\u201d Said Vivian as she stuck her hand out for a hand shake. I took it and shook hands.\r  \n\u201cI'm gonna get ready for bed Viv goodnight!\u201d I yelled as I walked away \r  \n\u201cGoodnight!\u201d yelled Vivian\r  \nI stepped into the poorly lit bathroom and turned on the shower \r  \n\u201cThat voice is seriously creepy.\u201d I muttered to myself as I took out my High ponytail and let my dark brown curls bounce down to my shoulders. My hair always did look nice with my pale skin\r  \n\u201cThanks to you mom.\u201d I said looking up at the ceiling \r  \nI stepped into the shower and started washing my hair when I heard something fall. \r  \nI opened the shower curtain to see the culprit my cat Leo\r  \n\u201cOh Leo you're going to be the death of me.\u201d I puffed out closing the shower curtain again\r  \nAnother crash comes from outside the shower curtain\r  \n\u201cLeo Get ou-\u201d I ripped open the curtain to find the toilet paper holder in the sink \r  \nI stared dumbfounded as to how my small cat could have body builder lifted the toilet paper holder into the sink. \r  \n\u201cVIIIIVIAN\u201d I screamed\r  \nHeavy footsteps pound down the hallway but no Vivian \r  \n\u201cVivian?\u201d I called \r  \nPounding assaulted the walls to the point they were vibrating as the footsteps continued\r  \n\u201cVIVIAN\u201d I endlessly scream for what seems like hours until the door bursts open and the walls stop pounding immediately\r  \n\u201cAre you okay, what's wrong, what's going on?\u201d Exclaimed Vivian with a very worried look.\r  \n\u201cYou didn't hear me screaming for you?\u201d I sobbed\r  \n\u201cNo, I just now heard you and came in. What happened?\u201d asked Vivian\r  \nI told her all of the events that had just occurred she looked towards the sink and back to me with a confused face\r  \n\u201cThe toilet paper holder isn't in the sink Evaline.\u201d She said pointing towards the sink which was in fact empty\r  \n\u201cWhat no I swear it was!\u201d I exclaimed\r  \n\u201cI believe you Evaline you never cry it's just odd try and get some sleep okay maybe you're really tired? Cooed Vivian\r  \n\u201cYeah maybe\u201d I said\r  \nI finished my shower without any problems and climbed into bed.Covering myself with the plushy blanket I let sleep take me over.\r  \n\u201cEvaline wake up!\u201d Vivian yell whispered as she shook me awake\r  \n\u201cWhat's going on?\u201d I groggily asked and then I heard it pounding on the walls but it was everywhere The walls were all slightly shaking\r  \n\u201cIs this what happened in the bathroom?\u201d Vivian asked me \r  \n\u201cYeah pretty much just not as loud.\u201d I said standing up I'm gonna go check it out stay her Vivian\r  \n\u201cYou're that white girl that dies in the horror movie.\u201d Vivian said with a smirk\r  \nI shook my head and stepped out into the hallway. Literally all of the walls seemed to be buzzing with the pounding. I made my way past the family portraits and got to the back door slowly putting my hand on the door knob and twisting it till I quickly pulled it open and the pounding stopped. I Looked around the dark backyard and I noticed something: the figure of a man standing by our fence. I looked closer trying to get a better look it was definitely a man.\r  \nI turned around to grab the bat sitting on our porch.\r  \n\u201cHey buddy you better beat it!\u201d I yelled, turning back with bat in arm to see he was gone.\r  \n\u201cWeird.\u201d I thought and went back inside the house. I closed the back door and turned to walk back to Vivian when I saw the shadowy man standing right in front of me.\r  \n\u201cAH-\u201d I started to scream but the air seemed to be sucked from my lungs and the only thing that came out was a small peep.\r  \n\u201cI don\u2019t like you creatures.\u201d The man said in a voice I can\u2019t even begin to describe. It wasn't human.\r  \n\u201cBut still you exist to only displease me.\u201d He went on \r  \n\u201cWho are you?\u201d I stammered\r  \n\u201cYou wouldn't know the word but you gave a soul hope tonight which made her free of me so now I need another soul in return for the one you greedily took.\u201d The man like thing said\r  \n\u201cAnnie?\u201d I asked shakily\r  \nHe made an odd gurgling crunching noise reminiscent of a laugh but sounded more like a garbage disposal. \r  \n\u201cObviously\u201d he replied \r  \n\u201cNow you're going to replace that soul.\u201d He said calmly\r  \n\u201cEvaline?\u201d Vivian placed her hand on my shoulder \r  \n\u201cEvaline Are you there helloooo?\u201d Vivan said snapping her fingers in front of my eyes\r  \n\u201cYeah sorry Viv I just was thinking.\u201d I replied\r  \nNow i'm writing this to you hoping someone out there knows what this thing is and how to get rid of it before I become the next soul to be taken by HIM.",

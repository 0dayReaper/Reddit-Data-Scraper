    "postText": "Shortly after Mom's tumble down the basement stairs, a stranger appeared at her door. Said he was collecting donations for an animal shelter and demanded to speak with the homeowner.\n\nKarima, my mother\u2019s care worker, only started the job three days earlier. But that was long enough to know the elderly lady she worked for turned the garden hose on both missionaries and canvassers alike.\n\nImagine her surprise when Mom came hobbling down the hall on metal crutches, *insisting* the gentleman come in.\n\nAt hospital, after Mumsie\u2019s ankle got reset, I broke the news that\u2014due to her \u2018advanced\u2019 age\u2014the doctors wouldn\u2019t discharge her without an adequate care plan. She lived on a remote street, just a narrow dirt lane overrun with weeds and bramble really. No friendly neighbours, nobody to help with chores.\n\nDespite the morphine, she sat up in bed spitting raw fury.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t support you alone,\u201d I whimpered. \u201cI\u2019m in London next week with work. Plus, Abbie\u2019s such a handful.\u201d\n\nThe incensed retiree made six nurses and one security guard cry before finally relenting.\n\nAfter Mom\u2019s visitor departed, I stopped by with some painkillers. Straight away Karima pulled me into the kitchen. A real no-nonsense type in her late-twenties, Karima had a brown ponytail and thick eyebrows.\n\nShe said, \u201cSharon spent all afternoon in the lounge with a guy called Carl. He acted like they\u2019d never met, but he knew his way around. He got angry at one point. Your mom said he\u2019s gonna come back to fix the ceiling fan in the basement. She sounded a little upset, though.\u201d\n\nStrange. Why would the thrifty woman who reused tea bags pry open her purse for charity?\n\nKarima said Carl was a big guy, bigger than me even, and old enough to collect a pension, although \u201cyou could tell he looked after himself\u201d. Think porcelain teeth and an even, bronze tan.\n\nThis news hoisted a red flag alright. What motivated this guy to cosy up to an ill-tempered old bat who half the neighbourhood kids believed would abduct them while they slept if they didn\u2019t finish their broccoli and wash behind their ears? There\u2019d be no point grooming her for the house\u2014her hovel was all stale air, sun-bleached wallpaper, and carpets so filthy you couldn\u2019t make out the floral patterns.\n\nAs she limped through the door, I asked about her new companion.\n\n\u201cMind your own business,\u201d she hissed. Her eyes flicked toward Karima. \u201cAnd tell the warden it\u2019s rude to snoop.\u201d\n\nFrom that day on, a permanent sickly feeling lined my stomach. I compulsively checked my mother\u2019s cash allowance, which depleted faster than expected. Karima insisted that, on their weekly shopping trips, Mom only ever bought discounted groceries and Vitamin D supplements. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s snacking at night?\u201d\n\nThat weekend, Mom summoned me for our Sunday roast, a fortnightly ritual. In a thick winter coat, I spooned unsalted mashed potatoes into my mouth. Because unless snow lay on the ground, turning the heating on was a cardinal sin in Mom\u2019s house, and since the basement door sat right beside the fridge, the kitchen got blasted by these relentless, chilly drafts.\n\nIt took me twenty minutes to muster up the nerve to ask Mom how such a rail-thin lady could rack up such a giant food bill. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you eat mouldy peaches instead of throwing them away. Where\u2019s this money going? Did Carl charge you to fix that fan?\u201d\n\n\u201cCarl does these repairs as a favour I\u2019ll have you know,\u201d she said. Her voice sounded odd, though. Like the killer instinct had bled out.\n\nThere was a short, uncomfortable silence. Between chews, Mom mentioned the council planned to build a shelter for truant youths nearby, which meant she needed to sell up before hordes of wild, feral teens began prowling the area.\n\nMy fork paused in mid-air. \u201cLet me guess, did Carl tell you this? Are you sure he isn\u2019t a conman?\u201d\n\nProminent neck veins bulged along her gaunt neck, the same way they did anytime younger me broke a plate or spilled juice. Whenever those tendons appeared, Mom would clamp my ear with her sharp, yellow nails and yank me into my bedroom. That was her solution to everything\u2014imprison you until her temper cooled off. Involuntarily, my head jerked to one side. A spasm.\n\n\u201cI just wanna make sure you\u2019re not getting scammed,\u201d I said, earlobe throbbing.\n\nShe slammed the table with her fist. \u201cI\u2019m selling, and that\u2019s that.\u201d\n\nUnable to meet that powerful gaze, I wolfed down more tasteless food.\n\n\u201cI swear. If I\u2019d known kids were this much trouble, I would have done things differently,\u201d Mom muttered.\n\nBack home, I splashed cold water across my face and stared down my reflection in the bathroom mirror. At times, I resented my green eyes and sharp nose\u2014features I shared with my mother. They made me feel contaminated. Dirty.\n\nMy daughter, Abbie, had just turned six. After I read her the latest Dogman and tucked her into bed, I joined my wife in the front room, where she commented on my twitch. I explained Carl\u2019s arrival brought my childhood tics storming back.\n\nShe said, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to sound insensitive here, but who cares if Angela gets cheated out of a crappy house? It\u2019d serve her right for everything she put you through.\u201d\n\nYears earlier, news about my wife\u2019s pregnancy broke two weeks *before* our wedding day. Mom\u2019s unsavoury name calling led to an hours-long screaming match between the pair, and time had not thawed their frosty relationship. I maintained a degree of sympathy, because Mom grew up a preacher\u2019s daughter, and her stern lectures gave me the occasional glimpse into adolescence under Grandpa\u2019s watchful eye.\n\n*\u201cIf father caught ME smoking, he\u2019d have locked me in the prayer closet until midnight.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cThe one time I rolled my eyes at MY father, he took away my pillow for three days.\u201d*\n\nIn her late teens Mom once ran away with a male friend, a move which got her permanently ousted from the church, but extracting the details was tougher than chewing through a bowl of salt.\n\nStill, my wife made a great point\u2014that house needed serious work. Plumbing renovations alone would set you back \u00a315k, easy. As a child I\u2019d lain awake at night, surrounded by groaning metal. Thuds, bangs. Even had nightmares about a poltergeist named Pipes who rattled the water fixtures. I hated being incarcerated there.\n\nIf Mom became homeless, though, she would have needed to move in with us, which meant Abbie might develop the same self-esteem issues as me.\n\nIn the morning, I asked Karima to call me the next time Carl appeared so I could speak with him, man-to-man. When she did, I heard only angry, muffled voices in the background. The nurse moved into a different room and said Mom ordered her out of the lounge.\n\nFurious, I climbed in my Volvo and sped across town.\n\nAs I pulled up the dusty driveway, Karima appeared at the door and said, \u201cYou just missed them. Carl took Angela to the garden centre.\u201d\n\nI slammed the dashboard in frustration.\n\nIn the kitchen, I sat by the table, my legs bouncing up and down, impatient. Minutes ticked away on the grandfather clock down the hall.\n\nKarima came in to wipe down the counters. I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s Carl been up to lately? Still fixing things?\u201d\n\nShe nodded. \u201cLast week he spent a whole afternoon in the basement. Said he was laying rat traps.\u201d\n\nHuh. I\u2019d never seen any droppings or scratch marks. The basement door refused to budge, as usual, so I went upstairs into the spare room where I rummaged through Mom\u2019s antique cabinet. In the bottom drawer there sat a ring of endless keys, but before I could find one that looked large enough and old enough to fit the lock, car wheels came crunching along the driveway. I slipped everything back in its place and then rushed downstairs.\n\nOutside, Mom waved off a silver Aston Martin. In her right hand, she had a bouquet of carnations: one red, one yellow, one blue. In the old days, she always received birthday flowers, but since any man who so much as complimented her purse caught an eyeful of pepper spray, the idea she had a secret admirer struck me as ridiculous. Now, though, I wasn\u2019t so sure.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019s your boyfriend in such a hurry?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNever you mind.\u201d\n\nAs I followed her around the ground floor, she shouted down the different ways I begged her to explain her relationship with this man before finally shooting me another patented death glare. \u201cEnough.\u201d\n\nThe protest dissolved on my tongue.\n\nSeeing no other option, I contacted a private investigator and gave him Carl\u2019s license plate. Six days later, we met in a coffee shop. \u201cCarl Richardson, age 64.\u201d The sleuth slid a file across the table. \u201cWidower with three kids, two sons and a daughter, each grown with children of their own. Started a construction company in the 70s and sold up before the crash in \u201908. Owns a villa in Madrid, and he\u2019s an elder at the Willowfield Presbyterian Church. From what I hear, he\u2019s hosted so many fundraisers they named an auditorium after him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, if this pricks so minted why\u2019s he cosying up to my mom? Her shacks one big bad wolf away from blowing over.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe lives just outside Bohill forest, right? If you bulldozed a few hundred trees, you could probably put up a block of flats. Deal like that might be worth a brave chunk of change.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s this asshole live?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cMaryville. Fair warning though, he\u2019s not the friendliest of blokes. I watched him explode over a petrol station parking space. Took six guys to hold him back.\u201d\n\nI sped over there.\n\nIron fenceposts surrounded a sprawling, four-story townhouse. Younger me always wished he lived in a place like that, surrounded by brothers and sisters, along with a dad who came home at the end of every day. Hell, even just *a* dad.\n\nI pressed the buzzer. Through the speaker, a housekeeper told me Mr. Richardson wasn\u2019t home, despite the Aston Martin parked in the driveway.\n\nI said, \u201cJust tell the prick he better stay the hell away from my mom.\u201d\n\nHalfway home, the she-devil herself called, rhyming off all the different ways I\u2019d embarrassed her since birth. Through tears, I told her I didn\u2019t want Abbie\u2019s grandmother dying penniless on the street.\n\nShe ended the debate by screaming, \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I like.\u201d\n\nReduced to a trembling mess, I pulled into the layby. My relationship with my mother, I\u2019d come to realize, was a scab. With this conflict, we\u2019d picked away the crust. Now bad blood had come gushing out. This needed to end.\n\nI texted Karima: *Think you can find out what Carl\u2019s doing in the basement for me?*\n\n*Sure thing*.\n\nFrom there, I mostly ignored Mom. Until her birthday reared its ugly head. Although she insisted we let these milestones pass without much fanfare, I at least swung by for dinner.\n\nImagine my surprise when my key didn\u2019t fit the lock. I rapped the letterbox for twenty minutes before Mom creaked the door open, far as the chain would allow.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d I asked.\n\nThrough the narrow gap, she said, \u201cYou can\u2019t be too careful these days. Theres dope addicts running about.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas this Carl\u2019s idea?\u201d\n\nShe broke eye contact. My mother, the most stubborn woman on planet Earth, actually broke eye contact.\n\n\u201cDoes Karima at least have a spare?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I fired her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cI caught her stealing jewellery. Besides, the cast came off. You can\u2019t keep me imprisoned forever.\u201d\n\nRather than kick in the door, I fought the temptation and grabbed my phone. \u201cKarima isn\u2019t answering,\u201d I said, as I texted her to call me back.\n\n\u201cHardly surprising, she\u2019s a fugitive now. And to think, you were worried about Carl. Anyway, I\u2019m tried and not in the mood for celebrating. Goodbye.\u201d\n\nThe door slammed in my face.\n\nThere was now zero doubt her suitor had groomed her. What should I have done, though, notified the police? And said what exactly\u2014that Mommy wouldn\u2019t let me into my childhood home?\n\nWell, if she\u2019d set her heart on getting dumped in a cheap care home staffed by workers who got paid minimum wage, so be it.\n\nThat night, I rolled around in bed, unable to redirect my memory from childhood. Until now, those formative years had been a distant afterthought, but with this situation sloshing around my brain, they lurked around every corner, uncomfortably close.\n\nI jerked awake. Beside the bed, Abbie rubbed her red, puffed-out eyes. \u201cI had a bad dream.\u201d\n\nI carried her into her room and read from a storybook about princesses. As she lay beside me, head rested against my shoulder, a giant lump rose in my throat. Mom never comforted me after a nightmare. Or ever. In fact, she\u2019d uttered the phrase \u2018stop whining or I\u2019ll GIVE you something to cry about\u2019 so many times it became her unofficial catchphrase.\n\nWhat the hell was wrong with me? Despite being a grown man\u2014a father, no less\u2014I\u2019d acted like a panicky child. What did Carl want with the house? Why this fixation on the basement?\n\nI drove over there, parked my car at the bottom of the lane, unlatched a downstairs window with a coat hanger, and climbed inside. One upside to life under an authoritarian regime are the tricks you pick-up\u2026\n\nThe grandfather clock ticked away while, upstairs, my mother snored louder than a jackhammer. The creaky staircase threatened to betray my arrival, so I slowly crept up into the spare room where I snatched the keys from the cabinet.\n\nI shuffled back downstairs. However, right as my foot landed on the bottom step, the clock announced the arrival of midnight. In the sleepy house, those chimes blared louder than a fire alarm. Startled, I slipped and collapsed onto the wooden floor.\n\nA lamp flicked on up in Mom\u2019s room, then footsteps shuffled around. I heard her voice, high and frightened. Most likely she\u2019d grabbed the bedside phone.\n\n\u201cMom, it\u2019s me,\u201d I shouted.\n\nDressed in a pink nightgown and fuzzy slippers, she appeared at the landing. \u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d\n\nShe stormed down the steps, boiling mad. It took some nerve to invade someone\u2019s privacy like that, what gave me the right? For a moment, I hung my head in shame\u2014a child caught with their hand in the cookie jar.\n\nUntil I remembered what brought me there in the first place. I\u2019d had enough of the manipulation. Of the unanswered questions. I needed, no, *deserved* an explanation.\n\n\u201cWhat gives *me* the right?\u201d I shouted. \u201cWhat gives *you* the right to treat me like the shit stuck on your shoe? All I\u2019m trying to do is keep a roof over your head, and *this* is the thanks I get?\u201d\n\nThose green eyes grew huge, the mouth drooping open. Maybe my outburst had shocked her into understanding the error of her wicked ways? Were we moments away from a tearful hug?\n\nNo such luck. Instead, the furious woman reached for the keys. I snatched them away.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare disobey me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026Because\u2026\u201d She fumbled for a reason. \u201c\u2026I\u2019m your mother.\u201d\n\nFrom deep in the house, the came a low thump. I glanced around.\n\n\u201cDo as I say. Now.\u201d\n\nMy body almost obeyed this request on pure instinct. Her word was a royal decree, unquestionable, absolute. But then beats of sweat ran down her forehead, filtering along the wrinkled grooves. For the first time, cracks appeared in my mother\u2019s impenetrable outer shell.\n\nI walked into the kitchen. As my hands rummaged for a key large enough to fit the basement door, I said, \u201cAre you gonna tell me what Carl\u2019s been doing down there?\u201d\n\nShe tugged at my arm, her hands coarse and cool, like reptile claws. \u201cNothing. He hasn\u2019t been doing anything.\u201d\n\nAnother thump.\n\n\u201cNothing, huh?\u201d\n\nThe door opened at a push. I pulled a cord hanging alongside my skull only to illuminate rickety stairs and a filthy, cramped utility room. There was a slit window halfway down the steps, a washer pushed up against the far wall, shelving units crammed with paint and washing powder and ancient records, and musty cardboard boxes scattered around, here and there.\n\nThose groaning steps sagged beneath my weight. Mom followed me along, her hands clinging to the rail. \u201cSee? Now enough of this nonsense, come upstairs.\u201d\n\nShe followed me into the centre of the space, all jutting nerves. What had her so anxious?\n\nFilled with raw courage, I kicked over a box. Newspapers spilled across the concrete floor and moths fluttered in every direction. I rummaged through hampers, tossed aside rotted furniture infested with woodlice. This was getting me nowhere. You could spend an entire month excavating that mess and barely scrap away the first layer of grime.\n\nWait. If Mom could stare me into a confession, maybe I could do the same with her? I went and stood facing her, her nose inches from mine. \u201cWhat\u2019s your secret?\u201d\n\nAt first, she only returned fire. But then those emotionless eyes flicked toward the shelving unit.\n\nWhen I glanced at it, she burst into tears. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m a terrible mother. Go sit in the lounge, I\u2019ll make you a cup of tea.\u201d The crying unnerved me more than her fury, honestly.\n\nBeneath the shelve, an arch had been ground into the concrete as though somebody dragged a heavy weight back and forth. I grabbed the unit, shimmied it off the wall. With considerable effort, the right side swung out, inch by slow inch, revealing a hidden metal door embedded within the brickwork.\n\n\u201cWhat the FUCK is this?\u201d I yelled. \u201cHave you got a fucking bomb shelter down here?\u201d\n\nHer icy talon caressed my cheek. \u201cPlease, come upstairs. I love you. Your father, he didn\u2019t want it to be this way. But you were so beautiful. With your green eyes and cute button nose. I couldn\u2019t do it. Not to you. Come upstairs. Please.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy\u2026father?\u201d I said, breathless.\n\n\u201cHis family, they couldn\u2019t know. And the church, oh the things they would have said. He wanted to bulldoze the house and destroy the evidence. He says we\u2019re too old to keep up the charade. It was my accident, George. It scared him. He said we nearly got exposed.\u201d\n\nAbove our heads, lights flashed across the wall as a car sped past the window and screeched to a halt. Hysterical now, Mom choked out a feeble, \u201cHe\u2019ll be furious.\u201d\n\nUnable to get these events straight in my mind, I twisted the metal handle while she rushed upstairs, wailing.\n\nThe door opened onto a windowless tunnel colder than a cave, musty-smelling and choked in darkness. An ungodly stench wafted out; stale air intermixed with sour sweat.\n\nAs I retched, chains rattled up ahead.\n\n\u201c\u2026Hello?\u201d\n\nThere came tiny cries.\n\nMy trembling hands grabbed my phone and switched on the torch. Then, on unsteady legs, I crept forward.\n\nHalfway down the tunnel gaping doorways opened on either side: one contained a toilet and a sink, the other a brief kitchen area. Metal rails ran along the walls at waist height.\n\nThe tunnel carried me into a box room, roughly ten feet long and ten feet deep. And as I cast the light in a wide arc, my pulse shot up between my ears.\n\nSitting on filthy, stained mattresses, frail figures shielded their eyes. On my right, there lay a man and a woman, both made from skin and bones. They wore grey jumpsuits and leather collars attached to the rails by metal chains.\n\nIn a stilted accent, the lady said, \"Please help us before mother and father realize you are here.\"\n\nThe room shifted on its axis. \u201c\u2026Mother and father?\u201d\n\n\"George,\" another figure cried. My light whipped toward the far wall, where Karima also sat fastened to the rail, her face purple-black with cuts and bruises. Before my mind could process this discovery, footsteps charged along the entryway. I spun around.\n\nA giant man with sharp brown eyes stepped into the confined space, baseball bat in hand, his head almost scraping the low roof. My mother arrived right after him, shrieking, \u201cCARL, STOP, PLEASE STOP!\u201d\n\nI stood there, feet rooted on the spot, until the old fella took a swing at me.\n\nAt the very last second, I jumped away. The bat found my phone, which spun out of my hand. Now only ambient light from the basement splashed across the room.\n\nIn a wild fury, Carl swung again and again. I sidestepped, ducked, scrambled away.\n\nNext time the club whistled through the air, inches from my face, I threw myself at Carl, and our hands wrestled for control of the weapon.\n\nRound and round we went, a little foxtrot. Once it became obvious his iron grip wouldn\u2019t let up, I drove my forehead into his nose, hard. The bat fell onto the floor, and then my fists reigned down blows, seemingly by themselves. My crappy childhood, all those missed birthdays and cutting remarks and countless hours spent caged inside my room, got channelled into each and every strike.\n\nAlthough my attacker had thirty years on me, he was stronger than an ox on steroids. He answered every fifth punch with one of his own. Around us, a chorus of \"Stop him, please stop him!\" went up, like Romans chanting for gladiators.\n\nSoon Carl\u2019s breaths became laboured. Difficult. A hand shot up against his chest. My aggressor couldn\u2019t maintain this pace\u2014I had him.\n\nBut then, from a side-angle, Mom flew at me. Sharp, yellow fingernails rake across my face, again and again.\n\n\u201cFOUL DISOBEDIENT CHILD,\u201d she shrieked, as an arthritic finger slice my left eye.\n\nFurious, I clamped my hand over her mouth and shoved her away. From the cathartic sound her body made toppling onto the concrete floor, she\u2019d need a full body cast after this.\n\nBefore I could react, Carl tackled me in the chest, driving me backwards until my skull hit the rear wall. A pair of steel hands closed around my windpipe, tighter than a python, and as I fought for air, warm blood trickled down my neck. A vision of my corpse rotting away down there flashed before my eyes. If Mom kept my body hidden, Abbie would grow up believing her dad abandoned her.\n\nBut then, with a quick rattle of chains, Karima vaulted onto Carl\u2019s back and bit his ear. Pressure around my throat eased. I pushed myself off the wall and dragged stale air into my lungs.\n\nAs Carl backstepped, Karima\u2019s bonds snapped tight. She got yanked backwards as if attached to a bungee cord.\n\nI grabbed the baseball bat and planted my feet and swung. It connected with a resonate thud. Carl spat blood and teeth across the sidewall. Suddenly on Bambi legs, he collapsed sideways and fell into the gloom. Then, a sputter went up.\n\nMy hand fumbled along the floor for the light.\n\nThose pale figures hunched over the old man with the stained, red jaw, their chains wrapped tight around his throat, biting deep into the flesh.\n\nCarl pawed at the air, eyes bulging from their sockets. When both arms fell limp and his head slumped over one shoulder, the figures released their chains and looked at my feet, beside which Mom lay on one side taking slow, watery inhales.\n\nFrom behind, Karima placed a hand on my shoulder. I flinched. I looked from her to the figures and back again. \u201cWhat the FUCK is going on?\u201d\n\nGently, she said, \u201cYou might want to sit down for this.\u201d\n\nThe pair stood, their chains rattling. Four pairs of eyes, brown eyes, studied me closely.\n\nKarima said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Your mother and Carl, they locked me down here because I found out about this place. The two of them, they\u2019d secretly been together for years, but they kept it secret because Carl had a family. Then when your mom got pregnant, they knew they couldn\u2019t let anybody find out, so they...well\u2026there\u2019d no easy way to say this, but George...\u201d\n\nThe nurse took a slow, steady breath.

So I think that connects Carl as OPs dad. It also explains why Carl brings her the flowers apparently she was getting every year on her birthday. \n\nI also think the basement siblings are OP\u2019s full siblings since the PI already said Carl had *3* grown children that have children of their own and he\u2019s widowed. Anytime OP\u2019s mom got pregnant it seemed he made her keep the others in the basement to not ruin his reputation but she mentioned she couldn\u2019t do it to OP bc of his beautiful eyes and cute nose",

    "postText": "\u201cLook, Jen, all I\u2019m saying is that you\u2019re a great girl. Kenny was an idiot. You don\u2019t need that cheating slimeball. The world is your oyster.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, I know. I just can\u2019t believe he\u2019d do something like that. I mean, we\u2019d been dating for three years. We were living together for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d I seethed, pounding my glass onto the counter.\n\nThe bartender glared at me. I mouthed an unapologetic \u201csorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you should get back at him. Find a hot guy and post him on your Snapchat story. That\u2019ll really get him fired up.\u201d\n\n\u201cKarah, it\u2019s been a week. It\u2019s still raw I- hey! Can I get another whiskey sour?\u201d\n\nThe bartender begrudgingly poured my drink as I slapped a ten onto the weathered hardwood.\n\n\u201cAs I was saying, revenge isn\u2019t really my top priority at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a real shame because leather jacket over there can\u2019t seem to take his eyes off you.\u201d\n\nI glanced to the opposite side of the room. She was right. A tall blonde man with round-rimmed glasses was staring at me from across the bar. His chiseled jawline was sharp enough to slice the thick smoke-riddled air as he quickly averted his gaze.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give it to him. He\u2019s cute. But there\u2019s a lot of emotions that I still have to work through. I\u2019m not ready to start anything with someone new just yet.\u201d\n\nKarah pursed her lips.\n\n\u201cI understand. Healing takes time. But you\u2019d better think quickly because that guy is heading over here.\u201d\n\nI glanced up. The man was swimming through the sea of patrons like a shark circling its prey.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no. Karah, you have to help me get out of this.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure thing, bestie,\u201d she smirked, flashing me a wink.\n\n\u201cThis seat taken?\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, actually-\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s all yours,\u201d Karah interjected, cutting me off completely.\n\nI scowled at her.\n\n\u201cSo, what are your names?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Jen and this is Karah. What\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cWayne.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice to make your acquaintance, but we-\u201d\n\n\u201cReally cool to meet you, Wayne! Tell us about yourself.\u201d\n\nI leaned directly into Karah\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cYou seriously need to quit doing that. You\u2019re really starting to piss me off,\u201d I hissed, growing more irritated by the second.\n\n\u201cBefore I go into that, can I interest either of you in a drink?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve got one right here. And I don\u2019t accept drinks from strangers.\u201d\n\nHe turned to Karah.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m good. I\u2019m actually about to take a smoke break. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n\nMy eyes tracked Karah across the room until she disappeared outdoors, leaving me alone with Wayne.\n\n\u201cDamnit, Karah. I swear, I\u2019m going to kill you when we get out of here,\u201d I thought, vowing to keep my promise on that.\n\n\u201cSo, tell me. How did a pretty little thing like yourself end up at a grungy dive bar on a Thursday night?\u201d\n\nI shifted my gaze to my glass, watching as the light brown liquid swirled around like a miniature whirlpool.\n\n\u201cMy boyfriend and I broke up about a week ago,\u201d I muttered despondently before downing half my drink.\n\nI grimaced as the liquor burned my insides like a wildfire.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. I\u2019ve had my fair share of breakups. They\u2019re not fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the understatement of the century,\u201d I scoffed as I polished off the remainder of the whiskey.\n\n\u201cYou know, I bet I could take your mind off it. At least for the night.\u201d\n\nI furrowed my brow apprehensively. A nauseating sense of unease washed over me like a tidal wave. I suddenly didn\u2019t feel comfortable around this man anymore.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\n\nHe held two fingers up to his lips in a V shape and wiggled his tongue between them in a lewd gesture. I wanted to throw up.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really gross, you sick bast- oh.\u201d\n\nMy head spun violently as I tried to stand, the room before me blending into an indistinguishable amalgamation of colors and shapes. I crumpled into the waiting arms of Wayne.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got you. Everything will be alright.\u201d\n\nI glanced up at him, my face contorted in a cocktail of confusion and terror. His features were a blur, melting into the world around me. I swear for a second, I could see red flash across his pupils. Then everything went dark.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI awoke in a strangely familiar room. A raging thunderstorm in my head sent shockwaves of pain rippling through me. As I gradually regained my clarity and my mental fog began to dissipate, I drank in my surroundings. I was lying in a bed. A man was rolled onto his side facing the wall. My heart dropped into my stomach. I\u2019d recognize those broad shoulders anywhere. Sleeping soundly next to me was Kenny.\n\nThat was impossible. I\u2019d broken up with him last week. Maybe Karah had something to do with this? She did always say that Kenny and I were made for each other. I had no earthly idea what was going on, but I needed answers.\n\n\u201cKenny. Kenny, wake up!\u201d I hissed, jabbing him in the back.\n\nHe groggily stretched his arms over his head and turned to me with that same sleepy look that I\u2019d always adored.\n\n\u201cMorning, babe. How\u2019d you sleep?\u201d he croaked as he leaned in to plant a kiss on my cheek.\n\nI quickly whipped my head away. He scrunched up his face.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Morning breath?\u201d he chuckled, settling into a resting position against the headboard.\n\nWhat was going on? He had to be screwing with me, right?\n\n\u201cKenny, you cheated on me. I dumped you last week. You know that. Why are you acting like we\u2019re still together? And how did I get here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking, right? Jen, I would never do that. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. We had a movie marathon last night, remember? I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d accuse me of something so\u2026 so disgusting.\u201d\n\nI stared into his deep blue eyes. He looked hurt. Like a child who\u2019d dropped his ice cream cone. I could read that man like a book, and to my utter shock, he seemed genuine. No. I wasn\u2019t crazy. I had proof.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah? Well, how do you explain this?\u201d I said, scrolling through my phone.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find them. The screenshots. They were gone. I searched everywhere: my photo gallery, my texts to Karah, my deleted pictures. There was no evidence.\n\n\u201cGive me your phone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cKenny, if you really trust me, give me your phone.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay. You\u2019re not going to find anything, though,\u201d he huffed, handing it over.\n\nI typed in his passcode and read through his texts, his DM\u2019s, everything. Not a single message out of line. Then, I stopped on my own name. I read through a conversation that I\u2019d definitely never had.\n\nHey babe, still on for 7 tonight?\n\nYep. I can\u2019t wait (;\n\nMe neither. See ya then. I love you, Jen Jen.\n\nI love you too, Ken Ken!\n\nI wanted to vomit. Not at the admittedly cringey texts themselves, but at the notion that maybe he was right. Maybe I did send those messages. But the previous week. I didn\u2019t just make that up. I couldn\u2019t have. The breakup, the bar, Wayne. That wasn\u2019t all in my head. Was it? I was seriously beginning to doubt myself. I tossed Kenny\u2019s phone back to him.\n\n\u201cI know who can clear this up,\u201d I said, dialing Karah\u2019s number.\n\n\u201cSuit yourself if you don\u2019t believe me. She\u2019s just going to tell you the same things I am.\u201d\n\nKarah picked up on the third ring.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the deal, Jen? It\u2019s eight in the morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, Karah, I\u2019m going to ask you something, and I need you to be completely honest with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways. Shoot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI broke up with Kenny last week. Do you remember that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Why\u2019d you do that?\u201d\n\nKenny pursed his lips and crossed his arms. My heart began palpitating wildly.\n\n\u201cNever mind. Forget I asked. One more thing. Was I with you last night?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you were with me.\u201d\n\nAha! There it was. I wasn\u2019t losing my mind.\n\n\u201cYou were with me until you left for Kenny\u2019s around seven.\u201d\n\nOr maybe I was.\n\n\u201cThanks, Karah. I\u2019ll let you get back to sleep now. See ya.\u201d\n\nKenny glowered at me disapprovingly.\n\n\u201cI told you nothing was going on,\u201d he said as he stormed to the bathroom.\n\nI tried to stop him. To apologize. To grovel for his forgiveness. But the words died on my lips. That was an hour ago. Kenny still hasn\u2019t come out of the bathroom. Am I having some sort of psychotic break? How could I fabricate an entire week\u2019s worth of memories? If it really was in my head and Kenny stayed faithful, I don\u2019t want to throw away a three year relationship over some false accusations.\n\nI\u2019m still confused as all get out. I was truly starting to believe that I was in the wrong. But now I\u2019m not so sure. My frantic search for answers brought me to the waste bin beside Kenny\u2019s nightstand. Inside lay a single crumpled piece of paper that simply read:\n\n*You owe me - Wayne.*\n\n[XX](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorJunkie123/)",

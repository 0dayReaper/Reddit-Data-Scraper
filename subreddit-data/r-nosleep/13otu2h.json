    "postText": "*Information about Tom Soul, Missouri is scarce. No library or archive or website makes much mention of it, today. The only reference I managed to find to the town was a poster, dated to the 1960s that a fellow collector obtained when he purchased a rare book. The poster was folded up inside as a bookmark. He offered to sell it to me, but I declined. Something about it is wrong. It doesn't belong to us. I don\u2019t want it in my home.*\u00a0\u00a0\n\n# IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING THAT HAPPENED TO THE FOSTERS\n\nBy Douglas Ray Cleavon\n\nPublished June 2006\u00a0\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part One:** [The Interloper](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/135hdlv/it_was_a_terrible_thing_that_happened_to_the/)\u00a0\n\n**Part Two: The Son**\u00a0\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cThe caves around Tom Soul are sick. A leaky kind of sick. That\u2019s what the locals would tell you when they tell you to stay away. Can\u2019t say I\u2019d disagree.\u201d\n\n\u00a0Dr. Malcolm Fisk, a historian and folklorist at the University of Missouri, was gracious enough to allow me to continue our interview after recounting the incidents involving the harrowing masked figure that plagued the town prior to the homicides of Theresa and Gideon Foster. The alarming description of the man,and his fixation on frightening people in town, made me feel like the Demon of Tom Soul was inextricably tied to the murders.\u00a0\n\nWhen I asked Dr. Fisk what sets the cave system within Tom Soul apart from the other caves and abandoned mines that are scattered around the rest of the Ozark Mountains,he provided me with resources to explore the history of Tom Soul from its founding. What I discovered was shockingly dark.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTom Soul was founded in the early 1800s and spent much of that time as little more than a place for fur trappers and miners to stop and get a drink. This peaceful existence was violently interrupted by the start of Prohibition in 1920.\u00a0\n\nWithout legal distilleries, moonshiners and bootleggers began to take full advantage of the extensive, natural hiding spots provided by the Ozarks herself, much to the chagrin of federal lawmen. Local police forces were happy to look the other way, likely because they were the recipient of cheap booze, but on a wider scale, Tom Soul was a problem.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Strong, quality alcohol without any real competition was being pumped out of the sleepy town without any real competition, quickly spreading into the surrounding counties. When federal agents came knocking, the moonshiners simply fled into the caves with their supplies, where the out-of-town agents were unable to follow safely.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOn a chilly mountain night, in the fall of 1928, enforcers of Prohibition traveled to Tom Soul for what proved to be the last time. They had spent weeks whipping neighboring towns into a frenzy, convincing clergy, and law-abiding citizens that the bootleggers and outlaws in Tom Soul were a threat to American values,and to the good word of God.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Armed, they stormed the caves with little warning to the people inside. They knew that the moonshiners would flee into the caves. They brought matches.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhen the moonshiners hid, the posse spilled the contents of the distilleries all along the cave, where it followed the moonshiners trail. The posse added firestarters, tinder, logs, anything they could think of, at the mouth of every cave in Tom Soul. Including Foster\u2019s Cave.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOnce the posse was satisfied, they lit it ablaze. The moonshiners tried to escape,facing the law over inevitable death, but they were not given a choice. The posse blocked the exits.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0People choked on the smoke, lungs charring from the searing heat. They suffocated to death, fire consuming oxygen before they could get the chance. They burnt,clothes catching alight, and when fleeing to the exit for help, they were shot.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAt Foster\u2019s Cave, a man almost made it out of the fire before a federal officer shot the man in the knees. Witnesses say this was likely on purpose. The man fell into the fire, and tried to drag himself forward, but the stone floor of the cave was too hot, and he roasted alive. Nobody who went into the caves that night survived.\u00a0\u00a0It seemed as though even before that bloody night in June 1976, the Foster property was a harbor for savagery.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhen I reached back out to the neighbor that I had previously interviewed, he claimed that Christopher Foster was preoccupied with the history of the town.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cElroy- my brother- was buddies with Christopher, but I never liked the guy much. Don\u2019t like to speak ill of the dead, but I\u2019m just being honest. He was strange, even before he got sick. Not much of a church goin\u2019 type, neither, which really riled up his pops.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t really remember much more than that, but hey, if you want\u2019a talk to Elroy, I can give him a heads up.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\u00a0\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nElroy, who asked me to omit his last name on request of his brother, currently resides in California with a domestic partner, where he is employed as a schoolteacher. He was hesitant to speak about the murder of Theresa and Gideon Foster, but became happy to share information when I explained I was more interested in learning about their life, and specifically, their son.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t deserve any of it,\u201d Elroy told me. \u201cHate to say it, but in retrospect,part of me is relieved that Christopher passed when he did. Maybe it spared him in some way.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nGrowing up, I lived in a little house right on the outskirts of Tom Soul. I was the oldest of six boys, and desperate for some sense of privacy. Christopher was the same as I was, but he was an only child. I think we found a sort of solace with each other.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHis house was somewhere I could escape to, and I think his parents were happy Chris had a pal his own age. They were always pleasant people. A little guarded, maybe, but pleasant. I think his dad had a hard time leaving his \u2018pastor\u2019 mask at the door.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe grew up doing just about everything together. Even though it was the sticks, there was a ton of things for wild young kids to get up to- maybe it was because we were way off in the sticks. We didn\u2019t have an arcade, or a theatre, so we spent most of our when we weren\u2019t at school or at home exploring the woods. If we were home before dark, and promised not to go into the caves, our parents were happy for us to be independent and out from under their feet. Different times, I suppose.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nChris was probably about 13 the first time he became seriously ill. He had to go to the hospital in Branson because he had pneumonia so bad. When he came home, it almost felt like he left whatever kept him a healthy young man behind. Never really recovered.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI think that\u2019s when he started reading more about the town\u2019s history. Maybe in retrospect it was a bit morbid, but after he got home, the doc had him on bedrest. Didn\u2019t have a lot to do other than look at that damn cave and think. Started spending less time outside together and more time at the little library next to the mayor\u2019s office. Helped me realize how much I loved classic literature, even if it wasn\u2019t quite as exciting.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNobody other than me and his parents really knew how bad his health had gotten until he started sleepwalking.\u00a0\u00a0To preface, this was a small enough town where everybody knew everybody. Today? Ina bigger town? Things wouldn\u2019t have been like this. But in Tom Soul?\u201d Elroy sighed. \u201cIt just made sense, to not make a big deal of things.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe first time it happened we were 14 or 15. Just starting high school. One of our neighbors went to get something from their cellar one night, and sitting down there in the dark was Christopher.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, the homeowner grabbed his gun and told him to leave, or he\u2019d shoot him, but it was clear pretty quickly that Chris had no idea how he\u2019d gotten down there. He was confused and crying, begging for his life, and that poor befuddled neighbor had to wake the Fosters up so they could come collect their son.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNobody, not even his parents, could figure out how he got down there without waking anybody up or leaving a trail. Nobody knew how long he\u2019d been sitting in that damp cellar. Alone, in the dark. Dreaming.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThey took him back to the doctor. Doc said it was just a severe case of sleepwalking, and they left it at that. Harmless. Chris wouldn\u2019t feel rested after an episode, but it wasn\u2019t going to hurt him.\u00a0\u00a0Word in town travels fast. The next time someone found Christopher in their house, they didn\u2019t bother with theatrics. They just called his parents to come take him home.\n\nAfter a while, it was normal. Creepy, of course, but just a quirk of the town. Nobody wanted to offend the pastor, anyways.\u00a0\u00a0Adults tried to be polite, but kids weren\u2019t so beholden to small-town politics.\n\nHe was weird, sickly, spent a lot of time indoors. Christopher was a real beanpole by this time, too. Had his hair long. The two of us were a bit bohemian, I suppose you could say.\u00a0\u00a0Girls were all over him, but the other boys didn\u2019t appreciate him much. I remember about halfway into our freshman year; a bunch of older teens jumped us on our walk to school. Beat the shit out of us. I had a black eye for what felt like six months. They held Christopher down and cut his hair, called him some choice names I don\u2019t believe you\u2019d be able to print in your article.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAfter that, it was just the two of us. When his illness got worse, I\u2019d come around every day with food for him and his folks. On his bad days I\u2019d read to him, or I\u2019d bring my records with me, and we\u2019d listen to music. I\u2019d clean up after he threw up and listen to him when he bitched about all the pills and teas his mom would have him try.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI loved Christopher. Part of me still does. I loved him in a way I couldn\u2019t tell anyone, until I moved far, far away from backwoods Missouri. But Chris knew. He wasn\u2019t ever going to feel that way about a man, but he accepted me the same.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhen we were about 21 or so, we went out to the creek on his parent\u2019s property, mostly for old times\u2019 sake,\u201d Elroy pronounced creek more like crik, just about the only thing about his speech that betrayed his backwoods Missouri roots.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis was one of his last good days. It was morning, and the weather was sublime. We sat on the bank of the creek with our feet in the water, not even talking. Just enjoying being outside.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe water was latte-brown, but too shallow to hide much more beyond an errant minnow. And then it rippled.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0A man rose from the water, exposing everything above his navel to the cool air of early spring. I knew he was, with that damn creepy mask on. It was the Demon of Tom Soul.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI scrambled backwards away from the bank through the brush, trying to put as much distance between myself and that creep as possible. Christopher hardly reacted. I wonder if part of him expected it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u2018Hey,\u2019 it said. It sounded like it had Marlboros for vocal cords.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMy breathing was ragged, but Christopher looked as collected as ever.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u2018Need a smoke?\u2019 Christopher asked. I wanted to tell him we needed to go, but I was frozen.\n\nI couldn\u2019t get control of my body enough to make a sound.\u00a0\u00a0Its eyes were glittering, and it rose the rest of the way from the water. It was totally naked, muscles defined and wiry, and it waded over to stand in front of Christopher.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nChris pulled a pack of cigarettes from his jacket. He never smoked. I don't know why he had them.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Thanks kid,\u2019 it said. It stuck the whole cigarette in its mouth, and after a moment, flipped it back out between his lips. The end was lit. The smoke didn\u2019t smell normal. It was tobacco smoke, sure, but there was something else there. Coppery, earthy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nChristopher turned to me, where I still lay on the ground. \u2018You should leave, El,\u2019 he told me. \u2018This isn\u2019t something you should be around for.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAnd-\u2026 I-\u2026 Douglas Ray, I was a coward. That knocked me out of my paralysis enough to get back on my feet and run home.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI checked in with his parents, a few days later, to see how he was doing. Sick, they told me. But he was home. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to visit him again. I carry that with me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThat day in the woods. That was the last time I saw Christopher Foster.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAccording to the town\u2019s paper, Christopher Foster\u2019s funeral was unexpectedly large, held on an overcast day, and closed casket. He had died after a long battle with an immune system disorder.\u00a0\u00a0Elroy hadn\u2019t reported his sighting of the Demon.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA few days after our interview, I got an email from Elroy. He told me that talking about his childhood and Christopher had jogged his memory. There was a story, about the town, that Christopher had been fascinated with.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDecades before the incident with the bootleggers, a stranger visited Tom Soul. He arrived in Missouri by train and claimed he was visiting his family deeper in the mountains. This visitor was strange. His hair was tangled and long, his face was clean-shaven, and his teeth were small and neat. The stranger laughed,high and manic, at inappropriate times, but seemed otherwise harmless. He stayed at a farmstead with a man, his wife, their son, and their daughter.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA week went by, and people saw the stranger in town. He\u2019d play card tricks, make unusual but friendly conversation. Talked a lot about how beautiful it was in the caves. Glow-worms and gold, he\u2019d repeat to shopkeepers.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA week went by, and nobody saw the family. Until one day a few men decided to go check on their property.\u00a0\u00a0It was burned to the ground. The stranger had been living in the ashes. His belongings were pristine among the wreckage.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLaw enforcement scoured the woods. They found them, eventually. The bodies of the family. All but the teenaged daughter. Bloodless, wrapped in layers of plaster and cloth. Propped up against outcroppings of rock, deep in the first chamber of Foster\u2019s Cave. Over the wrappings, the bodies had been dressed in their Sunday best.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe stranger staying with the family was quickly taken into custody and set to be executed without so much of a trial. \u00a0Small town justice, despite the man\u2019s claim of his innocence. On his day beneath the gallows, in a singsong voice, he said a prayer, and asked for chewing tobacco. He was hung with the dip spit running from his mouth.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nYears later, a strange smell came from beneath the floor of the local grocery. The same store operating in Tom Soul today, in fact.\u00a0\u00a0Unmistakable rot.\n\nThe grocer insisted he didn\u2019t know the cause. Perhaps produce had gotten stuck somewhere and gone off. It got stronger. He said he would fix it. Nothing improved.\u00a0\u00a0Too many people complained, and the townspeople pushed the hands of the law. The floorboards were torn up, one by one.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFor years, unbeknownst to anyone, the townsfolk had been walking, shopping, and eating above the body of a teenage girl. She was wrapped in strips of cloth and plaster, like the rest of her family, and dressed in beautiful lace. A facsimile of her face had been painted onto the plaster on her head.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDecay had set in, and the grocer\u2019s crime was revealed. He confessed. The unusual stranger had been just that- and a more sinister monster lurked amongst the townsfolk.\n\nOver the years,the grocer had become obsessed with the teenaged daughter of the murdered family. He watched her grow up. He decided he wanted her, needed her, and the only way to do so was to kill her family and take her for himself. He needed to make sure she couldn\u2019t run away, so he killed her too.\u00a0\u00a0He was hung and buried next to the unidentified stranger in an unmarked grave, somewhere outside of town. Some versions of the story have his body burned, or simply tossed into a mine shaft somewhere out in the woods.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI asked Elroy why he believed Christopher was interested in the story, and he said at the time, he just thought Christopher liked it for the same reason one might like any ghost story or local legend. But Elroy had been thinking, after our talk.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHe had been thinking about the days and weeks leading up to Christopher\u2019s death and the later murder of his parents. He reached out to people he knew from back then and managed to get his hands on the official record of the evidence recovered from the house that the Fosters had lived in until their untimely death. He thought I needed to see it, too.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ITEMS FOUND AT RESIDENCE OF THERESA AND GIDEON FOSTER**\u00a0\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-BLOODIED PILLOWCASE (A-TYPE, THERESA FOSTER) CUT WITH KNIFE\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-1 SHOTGUN BELONGING TO GIDEON FOSTER\u00a0-SPENT SHELLS BELONGING TO GIDEON FOSTER\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-1 \u201cFRARY AND CLARK\u201d BRAND HUNTING KNIFE, FOUND IN SINK (TRACES OF AB-TYPE BLOOD, GIDEON FOSTER)\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-BLOOD SPATTER IN SINK (AB-TYPE, GIDEON FOSTER AND O-TYPE, PRESUMED INTRUDER)\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- BURNT CLOTHES IN FIREPLACE, BELONGING TO THERESA AND GIDEON FOSTER\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-BURNT SCALP FOUND IN FIREPLACE, BELONGING TO THERESA FOSTER\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-BLOODIED JAWBONE, BELONGING TO WHITE-TAILED DEER (AB-TYPE, GIDEON FOSTER, AND O-TYPE,PRESUMED INTRUDER)\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-BLOODIED SOCKPRINTS MATCHING MEN'S SIZE 8 SHOE, PRESUMED TO BELONG TO GIDEON FOSTER (BLOOD BOTH A-TYPE AND AB-TYPE)\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- BARE FOOTPRINTS, BELONGING TO UNKNOWN SUSPECT\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-1 PARTIAL FINGERPRINT, BELONGING TO UNKNOWN SUSPECT\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-1 PARTIAL FINGERPRINT, UNIDENTIFIABLE\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-1 SAMPLE BLOOD SPATTER IN FIREPLACE (B-TYPE, PRESUMED TO BELONG TO CHRISTOPHER FOSTER)",

    "postText": "Tonight\u2019s kind of a catalyst for this post. I just received another message, and it\u2019s worse than any of the others. \n\nMy girlfriend died on the 7th of August, 2012. She was involved in a three car collision driving home from work when someone ran a red light. She passed away within minutes on the scene.\n\nWe had been dating for five years at that point. She wasn\u2019t big on the idea of marriage (it felt archaic, she said, gave her a weird vibe), but if she had been, I would have married her within three months of our relationship. She was vibrant; the kind of girl that would choose dare every time. She was happiest when camping, but a total technophile too. She always smelled like cinnamon.\n\nThat being said, she wasn\u2019t perfect. She always said something along the lines of, \u201cIf I kark it first, don\u2019t just say good things about me. I\u2019ve never liked that. If you don\u2019t pay me out, you\u2019re doing me a disservice. I\u2019ve got so many flaws, and that\u2019s just part of me.\u201d So, this is for Em: the music she said she liked and the music she actually liked were very different. Her idea of affection was a side-hug. She had really long toes, like a chimpanzee. \n\nI know that\u2019s tangential, but I don\u2019t feel right discussing her without you having an idea of what she was like. \n\nOnto the meat. Em had been dead for approaching thirteen months when she first messaged me. \n\n---\n[**September 4, 2013.**](http://i.imgur.com/UMh0nZl.png) This is when it began. I had left Emily\u2019s Facebook account activated so I could send her the occasional message, post on her wall, go through her albums. It felt too final (and too un-Emily) to memorialise it. I \u2018share\u2019 access with her mother (Susan) - meaning, her mother has her login and password and has spent a total of approximately three minutes on the website (or on a computer, total). After a little confusion, I assumed it was her.\n\n---\n[**November 16th, 2013.**](http://i.imgur.com/y0yzVaj.png) I had received confirmation from Susan that she hadn\u2019t logged in to Em\u2019s Facebook since the week of her death. Em knew a lot of people, so I instantly assumed this was one of her more tech savvy \u2018friends\u2019 fucking with me in the worst possible way. \n\nI noticed pretty much immediately that whoever was chatting with me was recycling old messages from [Em and my\u2019s shared chat history.](http://i.imgur.com/fw80ZJG.png)\n\nThe \u2018the wheels on the bus' comment was from when we were discussing songs to play on a road trip that never eventuated. \u2018hello\u2019 happened a million times.\n\n---\nAround **February 2014**, Emily started tagging herself in my photos. I would get notifications for them, but the tag would generally always be removed by the time I got to it. The first time I actually caught one, it felt like someone had punched me in the gut. \u2018She\u2019 would tag herself in spaces where it was plausible for her to be, or where she would usually hang out. I\u2019ve got screenshots of two (from April and June; these are the only ones I\u2019ve caught, so they\u2019re a little out of the timeline I\u2019m trying to write out):\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/X9G5agJ.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/55FwXKt.png\n\nAround this period of time, I stopped being able to sleep. I was too angry to sleep. \n\nShe would tag herself in random photos every couple of weeks. The friends who noticed and said something thought it was a fucked up bug; I found out recently that there have been friends who have noticed and didn\u2019t say anything. Some of them have removed me from their Facebook friends list.\n\nAt this point, some of you may be wondering why I didn\u2019t just kill my Facebook profile. I wish I had. I did for a little while. On days when I can\u2019t get out there, though, it\u2019s nice having my friends available to chat. It\u2019s nice visiting Em\u2019s page when the little green circle isn\u2019t next to her name. I was already socially reclusive when Em was alive; her death turned me into something pretty close to a hermit, and Facebook and MMOs were (are) my only real social outlets.\n\n---\n[On **March 15th,**](http://i.imgur.com/KIL2Mx5.png) I sent what I assumed was Em's hacker a message.\n\n---\n[**On March 25th**, I received an \u2018answer\u2019.](http://i.imgur.com/j3HwZzv.png)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was going over these logs a few months later that I noticed she was recycling my own words as well.\n \nMy response seems kind of lacklustre here. I was intentionally providing him/her with emotional \u2018bait\u2019 (\u2018This is actually devastating\u2019) to keep them interested in their game; I was working off the assumption that the kind of person to do this would be the kind of person that would thrive on the distress of others. I was posting in tech forums, looking for ways to track this person, contacting Facebook. I needed to keep them around so I could gather \u2018evidence\u2019.\n\nBefore anyone asks, yes, I had changed the password and all security info countless times.\n\n---\n[**16th of April.** I receive this.](http://i.imgur.com/uvadlGa.png)\n\nThis seems like word salad. Like all our conversations so far, it\u2019s recycled from previous messages she\u2019s sent.\n\n---\n[**29th of April.**](http://i.imgur.com/FGmhuUQ.png)\n\nI hadn\u2019t discovered any leads. Facebook had told me the locations her page had been accessed from, but since her death, they\u2019re all places I can account for (my home, my work, her mum\u2019s house, etc). My response here wasn\u2019t bait. \u2018yo ask Nathan\u2019 was an in-joke too lame worth explaining, but seeing \u2018her\u2019 say it again just absolutely fucking crippled me. My reaction in real life was much less prettier. I\u2019m not expecting my bond back.\n\nHer last few messages had started to scare me, but I wouldn\u2019t admit it at this point.\n\n---\n[**8th of May.** I don\u2019t really have the words for this.](http://i.imgur.com/GNL8TcO.png)\n\n\u2018FRE EZIN G\u2019 is the first original word she\u2019s (?) made. This has given me nightmares that have only started to kick in recently. I keep dreaming that she\u2019s in an ice cold car, frozen blue and grey, and I\u2019m standing outside in the warmth screaming at her to open the door. She doesn\u2019t even realise I\u2019m there. Sometimes her legs are outside with me.\n\n---\n[**24th of May.**](http://i.imgur.com/z295fHw.png)\n\nI wasn\u2019t actually drunk. She wasn\u2019t an affectionate girl, and it always embarrassed her to exchange \u2018I love you\u2019s, cuddle, talk about how much we meant to each other. She was more comfortable with it when I was boozed up. I got fake-drunk a lot.\n\nHer reply is what prompted me to finally memorialise her page, thinking it might help curb this behaviour. It might seem innocuous compared to her previous message - it\u2019s pasted from an old conversation where I was trying to convince her to let me drive her home from a friend\u2019s. \n\nIn the collision, the dashboard had crushed her. She was severed in a diagonal line from her right hip to midway down her left thigh. One of her legs was found tucked under the backseat. \n\n---\n[**Going back in time. 7th of August, 2012.**](http://i.imgur.com/ujUNJQm.png)\n\nThese are logs from the day she died. She was usually home from work by 4.30. This, alongside a couple of voicemail messages, is the last time I talked to her under the assumption that she was alive. You\u2019ll see why I\u2019m showing you these soon.\n\n---\n[**Yesterday. 1st of July, 2014.**](http://imgur.com/W6qzAZI)\n\nI memorialised her page a couple of days after I received the message about walking. Until today, she\u2019d been quiet; she wasn\u2019t even tagging herself in my photos. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do anymore. Do I kill her memorial page? What if it is her? I want to puke. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. \n\nI just heard a Facebook alert. I'm too afraid to swap windows and check it.\n",

            "comment": "the thing that gets me about this story is the \"So cold\" and \"Freezing\" comments. A few years ago when flip phones were still a thing, i got the creepiest text. My best friends Chris' brother Pete (who was like my big brother I never) had killed himself. Fast forward a few years to one day when I was thinking about Pete all day randomly and I receive a text from Chris that says \"so cold 0 chills\" then it said \"freezing\" I replied to Chris saying \"what the hell are you talking about lol\" He didn't reply just another text saying \"where am I?\" It also said \"Pete\" as well but this is going back almost ten years ago so I can't fully remember what else it said. \n\nSo I call Chris laughing saying are you having a stroke or something? He said he has no idea what I'm talking about. So I explain to him the text I got thinking he pocket texted me or something. He checks his phone and nothing is in his sent box. He's FREAKING out saying he didn't send it and starts telling me that he was thinking a lot about Pete the last few days as well. Pete had been dead at least 6 years at this point so it was odd that we both had him heavily on our minds that particular day. Also to receive that text. I know Chris would never and I mean NEVER joke about Pete texting me. He was almost in tears when I read the text. \n\nSo seeing the cold and freezing thing here on a screen sent chills down my spine like i haven't had in a very long time. Regardless of this being true or not it definitely struck a nerve.",

This doesnt fit 100% with OP but some striking similiarities. 2 teenage boys in south wales were in a motorbike accident and one was killed. The names were not revealed but a picture of the memorial reads \"RIP NATH\" next to a heart (noting the unexplained heart in OP's earlier picture). Also the boy who survived had a broken leg...(theme) This happened in broken hill, lots of trails around and LOTS of camping grounds (OP's gf liked camping). Also grey street is at a national park outside sidney..(maybe trail there?) http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2012/08/07/3562400.htm link to story\njust the picture http://imgur.com/yKKAwDj\n\n\nON another note. I noticed that freezing was broken apart into FRE EZIN G is broken into 3 making it look like a code. add the number of the corresponding letters in each group  (i.e. f-6 R-18 E-5 =29..) you get 29-44-7. according to asis.com that is depature, perdition (hell), and then completness and perfection to the end. perhaps perdition in this case could be pergatory.\n\nand... genisis 44-29 \"If you take this one from me too and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in misery.\" This is referring to god having already took one of this mans 2 sons (like the motorbike accident) gray occuring again, seemingly a theme.\n\nWell thats how i spent the past 4 hours. Probably just coincidences but i was entertained.\n",

She only messages you at night or randomly hours before you get them, and responds instantly when you are stressed from the message. Your friends have defriended you because of it? Maybe because they see the signs that you cant, the way you act or the things you say without you realizing it. Take this as \"food for thought\".\n\nMy advice, seek professional help my friend, the human psyche is nothing to fuck with and you are doing a number on yourself. No one blames you for missing her, no one is at fault for wanting attention from her or anyone else. This path you are on is not a good one, I just hope you seek help before its too late.",

Mostly to this sentence:\n*I'VE OCCASIONALLY OPENED* her chat window and have seen the 'Emily is typing' message. The message usually never comes through.\n\nNow this one:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/29kd1x/my_dead_girlfriend_keeps_messaging_me_on_facebook/cilr54y\n*SHE'S MORE REAL TO ME* there then in her columbarium.\n\nThen:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/29kd1x/my_dead_girlfriend_keeps_messaging_me_on_facebook/cilrmve\nI don't know if I'm scared because I'm weak, or scared because *I SHOULD BE SCARED*. Thank you.\nI keep getting mental pictures of her, *IN THAT STATE*,\n\nLater on:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/29kd1x/my_dead_girlfriend_keeps_messaging_me_on_facebook/cils49t\nI don't own anything with *A HEART* on it,\n\nAfter that:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/29kd1x/my_dead_girlfriend_keeps_messaging_me_on_facebook/cils9ns\nMaybe they *JUST FUCKED UP* typing out the right sentence,\n\nAnd finally:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/29kd1x/my_dead_girlfriend_keeps_messaging_me_on_facebook/cilsm06\n*IT'S VERY NOT ME*, but I haven't had much of a grasp on what 'me' is for a while anyway.\n\n\nThese are just taken from his \"comment summary\" (I don't know how it's called since I have reddit on Spanish as I live in Argentina) from the earliest till the latest of his updates.\n\nSo far we found, throughout his comments and posts, these fragments:\n\nI've occasionally opened - she's more real to me - I should be scared - in that state - a heart - just fucked up - it's very not me.\n\nI realized this by reading every single comment he has made on this thread and this makes me think: \nHe posted an update \"compiling\" random fragments of text he has written in the past, without making much sense. Is this fact connected to the fact Emily sent fragments of old conversations whilst making no sense? Perhaps. \nBut then a grim question comes to mind:\nIs the fact that this pattern is found on both telling us that Nathan is in fact dissociating and responsible for both things, or rather that Nathan's last message since almost a month was written with the pattern \"Emily\" used?\n\nI don't know what to think guys... This is a big discovery. But I can't tell if it means Nathan is alright or not... Please tell me your thoughts. I'm scared shitless, ain't gonna lie.",

I don't know what any of this may mean... but here it is. Look for the sections with ***___*** around it.\n\nI should be scared. \nI've occasionally opened a heart\njust fucked up It's very not me\nShe's more real to me\nin that state\n\n\n\nI saw her after the accident. I keep getting mental pictures of her, in that state, trying desperately to contact me. I don't know if I'm scared because I'm weak, or scared because ***I should be scared***. Thank you.\n\n\nThere are a few things that get to me, though. No one really knows that her legs were shorn off in the accident, but it's possible whoever just got lucky with that comment about walking.\n***I've occasionally opened*** her chat window and have seen the 'Emily is typing' message. The message usually never comes through.\nWhoever it is is REALLY dedicated to the 'joke'.\n\nI don't own anything with ***a heart*** on it, and no one was over that night. That's definitely heart-like, though. Really weird.\n\nReally good eyes. I'm not sure. Maybe they ***just fucked up*** typing out the right sentence, and this is proof of human hands at play. It was also always a point of contention between us that she got off a full hour earlier than I did, but that seems flimsy.\nOn second thought, the crash was just before 5. There could be something in that - copies of some of the crash investigation reports are at her mum's, so I might check out the times when I'm over there next.\n\ngave me a really strange, prickly feeling\nThis has been ongoing for me for the last handful of months. It gets really exhausting.\nI'll check it out, or other books like it. I feel so weird doing this, because I would have NEVER believed in this kind of thing before. ***It's very not me***, but I haven't had much of a grasp on what 'me' is for a while anyway.\n\nThis is a really good idea, and something I've been considering doing on and off. It's just, there's this part of my brain that thinks that I might still have the tiniest connection to her, even though every 'conversation' with her makes my mouth dry and stomach hurt. ***She's more real to me*** there then in her columbarium. It's so final.\nBut I agree. I think that's my endgame.\nEdit: I would also piss off or upset several thousand people following it, including close friends that post there at least once a week.\n\nI saw her after the accident. I keep getting mental pictures of her, ***in that state***, trying desperately to contact me. I don't know if I'm scared because I'm weak, or scared because I should be scared. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\nWeird but I found em all and put it together for you. Hope it helps.",

Although i realize it is not op's house\n\nEdit 3: i just wanted to find an house that had a window/doorway like that, so we could assume other houses at SW have similliar characteristics and help prooving that OP does in fact live in SW. Since then I found some other houses with similliar windows/doorways.\n",

            "comment": "I consider myself to be a rational person but this thread is just scary, not because of ghosts, but because of either how much a disassociative state can fuck with the mind or how creepy can a human make a story if they wanted to. And I really want answers at this point because those are some fucked up how's.\n\nSo starting from the beginning, we know that there are two possibilities here (apart from the third one, the subreddit, which I'll assume is not a possibility for the sake of rules and discussion); either Emily's ghost is actually messaging Nath and he wants a space to vent his grief, or Emily/Nath are so grieved by the other's death that they have made an alternative reality where they have a different identity. He said he changed the passwords so a third person is a long shot, which has already been established I think. Taking the bottoms up approach, in both of those cases, they choose a subreddit which has an explicit rule about not calling out on the reality of a ghost story. Given the the dissociate states of Nath/Emily or a ghost-chased Nathan know that handicap of this subreddit and how reddit works, isn't this literally the last place they'd wanna post it? Because no one can call them out on the reality, which is not just harmful to the apparent motives but exactly opposite to them. From a top down approach it would make sense, because someone posted a real story in nosleep which is allowed, but from the OP's perspective and the assumption that it is in fact happening to a real person, choosing nosleep for the post came across to be incredibly odd to me. \n\nSecond, for the life of me I haven't been able to find a news report of any Emily dying in a three vehicle accident on August 7, 2012, or anyone even close to her. I've checked obituaries, national death records, wikipedias for anybody who died on that date in that area, and nobody of that description shows up. But coincidentally enough, and it has been linked here before in passing, on 7 August 2012 a news of a teenager dying in NSW shows up, and I am just not able to get that off my mind. \n\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2012/08/07/3562400.htm\n\nThere's no names but in the picture is RIP Nath, with a fucking heart sign. If you say that no way our Nath is 16, well, I'm very sure that's not the Nath we're talking about, because that accident happened on last Saturday at the time of reporting, and 7 Aug was a Tuesday, so not on 7 Aug 2012. Did someone try to make a creepy pasta about a dead man telling us about how he thinks his dead ex is messaging him, decided on the date, looked up any accidents that happened on the date and used symbolisms like the name and the heart symbol from it to make it convincing? Maybe for us to find that out and freak out thinking a dead man just posted to nosleep? I don't know, and that's against the rules to discuss anyway. But that is the only story with four of the recurring themes here, Nath, 7 Aug 2012 (yeah the accident didn't happen on that date but that is the first accident on google search in NSW if you're looking for a real accident to tie your story on a specific date to), New South Wales  and heart symbol (which NateSw recurrently drops in his posts), take that as you will.\n\nAnother thing, when someone suggested that the spectre thing in that bikini thing might be there, NateSW said something like 'too many Princess leighs in these parts'. He makes a post about he being terrified of his dead gf messaging him and someone suggests that in one of the photos the ghost tagged itself there might actually be a ghost in his computer room (which he was in at that time), and he doesn't shit his pants and jokes about it? No clue why that stood out for me, he sounds pretty terrified in all the other posts and is totally calm on an info half the internet loses its balls on? Also in that image, there is a weirdly symmetry to the reflection of the light, it\u2019s almost perfect. I\u2019m not an image expert by any means, but aren\u2019t there softwares to see if an image has been touched by photoshop by examining shadows and noise difference etc.? No clue if that\u2019s something, but the symmetry definitely looks artificial to me, hopefully someone can crack the mystery about the photo being original and non-manipulated. I\u2019ll ask people if that can be done,\nI\u2019m inclined to believe (and yeah mods, pretend, but I think this has gone way out of all of our hands to pretend anymore) that a ghost is messaging Nathan, or Nathan is dead and Emily is in a dissociative state that she thinks she\u2019s the one dead, or it\u2019s Nathan\u2019s coping mechanism, but\u2026but I have no clue, those points are most probably garbage but I found them, odd. One thing is for sure though, their real names are supposed to be Nathan and Emily from the FB chats, so total anonymity is at least one hurdle off in our quest to find answers.  \n",

Didn't pay attention to other then OP's postings and comments regarding his posts (completely ignoring for example the youtube videos and everything else that came along from copycats). \n\nStill a mystery how the original post really got to me so much. As with many others here I have been online for so long and read so much weird that I used to believe I was immune to getting obsessive about a forum post :) There is something about the way OP express himself that give me a strong sense of honesty, probably based on years on IRC, ICQ, MSN, SKYPE etc.......after some years you just read between the lines, and this post got me good.\n\nI had so many theories at one point and still keep checking to see if anything is happening but there is not. Marketing value of this post when it was on it's peak must have been 6 figures in USD. So when there is no marketing stunt, no \"post of the month\", no updates and nothing I am left with only the conclusion that OP is mentally in a very unhealthy place and hopefully taken care well care of wherever he might be.\n\nSo when you come to /nosleep for \"scary\" the irony is that one the scariest thing(madness) unfold right in front of your eyes as the story progressed.",

If so, maybe she's asking you to go for one final walk with her. I feel like the wheels on the bus comment is her way of asking you to go there. After time and you still haven't gone maybe she's starting to feel like you wont ever go. Maybe you should grab a sweater of hers and go to the trail. Take a slow walk, stop at the usual places you would and just talk to her. Tell her you miss her, and tell her you're there to say goodbye. It may be the release you're both looking for. Afterwards you could message her either with a simple I love you goodbye or something else. Or you could not say anything.  One thing for sure if you do go make sure you take your phone, if it's her only way to communicate you want to be sure she has the opportunity to do so while you are there.",

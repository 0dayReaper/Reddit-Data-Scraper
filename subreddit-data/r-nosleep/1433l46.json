    "postText": "I had been contacted by the magistrate to investigate a night wedding in the countryside that had involved the loss of human life. There seemed to be a recent rise in [tourists involved in ghost dowries](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13zxeq5/wedding_nightmares_night_wedding/) over the years. However, from my research I believe it was a man in search of night weddings for personal gain that was the cause of so many deaths.\n\nWhen I received the request, I was nearby on Green Island, and addressing a rather unique matter even in my line of work. A little girl from the mainland had arrived two weeks prior and claimed to be the recently deceased husband of the grieving widow.\n\nThe child claimed to have woken up in a hospital where the doctors informed them that they had drowned and was clinically dead for 4 minutes when the body inexplicably sat upright in the gurney. This would have seemed to be great news, except when the child looked into the mirror, it was not their face staring back at them.\n\nIn old Taoist texts I have read of such events, where the bodies of the recently deceased are not put to ground quickly enough, and their souls are left to wander. They could get carried away by the Northeast or Southwest wind. Depending on the location from where they died. And possibly attach to an empty host.\n\nThis seemed to be the case, as the wife acknowledged that due to the wet season, they did not bury her husband's body right away. Because the grounds were so wet, that any graves would wash away, leaving corpses laying in the street. Still, I had the responsibility of testing the child. Whom passed a simple test of naming names. Where they used to live. The wife's habits. A conversation they recently had, and even childhood memories. All were confirmed by friends and family. But it would be the child's handwriting that ultimately convinced me. They were a perfect match, down to the signature.\n\nUpon my approval, the villagers had no choice but to accept that this child was indeed the man come back to life. And when I left, he was sitting outside of his house cleaning fish as he had always done for 32 years, except now in the body of a 10 year old girl.\n\nI didn't have much time to dwell on this case as I was needed at the aftermath of the failed night wedding. Ghost dowries have been in use for thousands of years, and traces of it can be found in many different cultures. From the Aztec to the Egyptians, and more recently from old Spain to the streets of Southeast Asia. Though in recent times, only a few remote places continued the practice, and there are a limited number of priests today who are qualified enough to handle such a case. Luckily, I had plenty of experience in this matter.\n\nIn my early years, I had married many ghost brides.\n\nAnd was often asked, \"But you're a priest, how can you get married?\"\n\n\"Zhengyi Taoist priests can choose to take a wife or not. In fact, in order to pass on my Celestial title, I must have an heir.\"\n\nThe man looked distraught, \"And you're sure this will stop her from whispering into my ear every night?\" He clutched the bag rather tightly.\n\n\"Don't you worry,\" I took the bag from his hands. \"Everything will be fine.\"\n\nWe would perform the customary vows and the following night the man reported no more whisperings from his daughter, yet a week later, the police raided my hotel in a different district. The man had claimed that I had swindled him. That his daughter had returned and continued her whispering of terrible, horrible things that he dare not listen. Clanking and banging away in the walls as he covered his ears in fear until sunrise.\n\nFortunately, I was allowed to prove my innocence.\n\nI returned and stayed in the man's room, waiting with him for signs of his daughter. And surely enough, late in the hour, I heard the wretched scraping and dragging in the walls. The man stopped breathing in his bed and laid perfectly still. Even I was afraid to move as the most dangerous aspects of my practice are in the unknown. My mind began racing, wondering if I had somehow botched the night wedding. Or worse, that the ghost bride wasn't his daughter at all, and I had inadvertently given this mysterious entity a special anchor to this world, a holy man.\n\nThe walls shook without reason. And a tiny noise could be heard near the man's bedside. He jumped off his mattress and ran to my side. The two of us watched as the noise traveled back and forth against the back wall like wooden clogs.\n\n\"My daughter did always carry around a rattle drum when she was little,\" the man whispered.\n\n\"Hush, don't let it capture your breath,\" I warned him. \"Whatever this is, I don't believe it is your daughter. And because of the ritual, we may have increased its hold on this realm.\"\n\nHe whimpered, \"Not my daughter?\"\n\nI held up my finger and traced the noise as it traveled in an odd form. I began to wonder if the entity was creating some sort of symbol.\n\n\"What are you drawing,\" the man cried.\n\n\"It may be creating a portal,\" I told him. \"Now hush before it turns its attention toward us.\"\n\n\"Please, there must be something you can do?\"\n\nI reached into my bag and pulled out some incense. I lit the ends and began chanting. From my waist I pulled out a long yellow parchment. And drew on it a sealing spell. \"Spirit,\" I called as I stepped forward. \"I am a guiding light.\" The noise rattled with conviction as I drew closer. \"Let me lead you to peace!\" And with one quick motion I punched my hand through the wall, clutching the sealing spell in my palm, at the last place I heard the noise. To my displeasure I felt something wriggling in my grasp as something long and thin wrapped itself around my wrist, its end clawing at my forearm. I screamed when I felt its teeth sink between the soft flesh of my thumb and index finger. But I did not let go. Instead I pulled out this demon from the wall and threw it roughly to the ground.\n\nThe man screamed as he jumped onto a chair, \"Rat!\"\n\nYes. A simple field rat. That had a trap stuck on its tail which caused its movements to rattle in the wall. It had been rummaging near the man's nightstand because in one of the drawers he had left a bag of watermelon seeds.\n\nNot all cases are this simple, and plenty are true to life supernatural encounters. Over the years my experience has taught me to be more cautious in my evaluations. Which was why when I finally arrived at the house of the massacre due to a failed night wedding. Every hair on my neck stood on end as I tried to be objective as possible.\n\nBut there was no denying that something heinous had occurred here. Bodies were still laying on the floor. Some with their faces in the dirt. Some missing their heads completely. And those with their faces up, were unrecognizable. I felt the cold presence of my first wife as she leaned into my ear and whispered to me, \"This is the work of a ghost bride.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I recognize her anger. It was mine before we were married.\"\n\n\"How do I know what?\" A man walking toward me asked. \"Are you the priest they called out here?\"\n\nHe was average built, and in plain clothes, \"Detective, why yes. I am here to assist you in anyway that I can.\"\n\nThe detective spit on the ground, \"Assist me? As far as I'm concerned we're wasting valuable time carrying on with this hocus pocus bullshit. The killer's trail will be cold by the time we get through all this religious tape.\" He wafted the air in front of his face, \"And the dead bodies boiling out here. This is all your fault as well, as far as I'm concerned. Assist me,\" he snorted.\n\n\"Are there any eyewitnesses, Detective?\"\n\n\"Several. But they are all saying the same damn thing. Spouting a bunch of nonsense. Which is why those religious nuts down at the town hall dredged you up.\"\n\n\"All non-relatives to the home owners?\"\n\nHe snorted again, \"Coincidence.\"\n\n\"Let us hope so,\" I told him. \"Because the alternative is much worse.\" I walked the scene, going around the upturned tables, tracing the steps of carnage in the courtyard, to the main living room. There I saw the body of an old man, both hands clutching his chest, his face was completely missing. \"Any surviving family members?\"\n\n\"Some are still left,\" he grunted. \"But we've gathered most of them under police protection.\"\n\n\"Have you located the husband?\"\n\n\"Yeah, we're extraditing him as we speak.\"\n\n\"Extradite?\"\n\n\"The foreigner took off in the middle of all the commotion. Boarded a flight back home according to our investigation. We've contacted the airline, and the airport security in America will hold him when he lands. As he is currently my number one suspect.\"\n\nI circled the area in front of the shrine. Noting the spilled bowl and its contents on the ground. The position of the spoon next to it. Before standing in the spot on the left side where the effigy would have stood. \"What about the bride?\"\n\nThe detective shook his head, \"What bride?\"\n\n\"It was a night wedding,\" I told him. \"There must have been a physical object acting as a stand in for the daughter's soul.\"\n\n\"Nothing more than bags of cotton usually,\" he paused. \"But they did report that the stand-in this time was some sort of department figurine. A mannequin of some sort.\"\n\n\"Have you looked into that?\"\n\n\"Why would I look into that. Are you crazy?\"\n\n\"Right, you're right of course. You'd have to wait until after sunset to be able to figure out which mannequin serves as the ghost bride's earthly form.\"\n\nThe detective stormed off as if I had said something outlandish. Leaving me to my own devices, I interviewed a few of the neighbors who attended the night wedding, gathered some evidence and logged it with the other officers at the site, and then left for the nearest hotel in the city.\n\nIt had been a long month for me and I couldn't think of anything that I would enjoy more than a cold beer. So after checking in I went down to the bar, where an ethereal creature sat alone. She was beautiful to say the least and I had to strike up a conversation lest I live a life of regret, \"S'il te pla\u00eet ma ch\u00e9rie, dis-moi comment on t'appelle pour que quand je sois perdu dans les t\u00e9n\u00e8bres. Puis-je demander la lumi\u00e8re.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Oh, American. I apologize. I thought you were French.\"\n\n\"On my mother's side,\" she brushed away her hair.\n\nI noticed the ring, \"Ah, you are married. My sincerest apologies miss. I didn't know you were with someone.\"\n\n\"Newly married,\" she commented. \"My husband is speaking with the concierge.\"\n\n\"Activities on vacation,\" I mused. \"How wonderful.\"\n\n\"It's nothing like that. It seems someone has left him a note. And we're technically on our honeymoon.\" She paused, \"Though this isn't where we're supposed to be. We're supposed to be in Hawaii.\"\n\nI ordered a beer with the bartender and sipped my drink, \"Hawaii is wonderful, but this is also a beautiful island. In fact, when the Portuguese came here, they named it Formosa. Which translates to beautiful island. It may not be where you're supposed to be, but perhaps you'll find that this is exactly where you need to be.\"\n\nThe woman sighed, \"I don't even know anymore.\"\n\n\"Ah, I know what this is. I've great experience in these matters. Having been married many times. You feel doubt.\"\n\nShe laughed, \"How many times have you gotten a divorce?\"\n\n\"Divorce?\" I laughed. \"I never leave a woman after we have been wed.\"\n\nShe looked taken aback, \"Oh. I didn't know polygamy was so common in these parts.\" She glanced behind her to where a tall man was standing with what looked to be the hotel's concierge. \"I guess we're in the same boat.\"\n\n\"It's not what you think,\" I told her.\n\n\"Where have I heard that one before,\" she rolled her eyes.\n\n\"Larissa!\" The man called for her.\n\nShe stood up, \"Well, it was nice meeting you. Tell your wives I said hello.\"\n\nI smiled as she left, glancing at my sides. \"If only you knew,\" I said while sipping my beer.\n\nNow in hindsight, if I were not so fatigued after nearly a month of work and travel. I would have perhaps picked up on the fact that she too was familiar with the concubine lifestyle. Which was unusual in itself for an American. Or perhaps I would have picked up on the fact that Larissa was an uncommon name. As I had read Jim's article. But there was no such luck, which is why, when I say that I am deeply regretful of what I read on the news later about the couple, I am truly at a loss for what I could have prevented. But that is not my story to tell.\n\nAfter I finished drinking at the bar I made my way to the elevator and got in. When a man coming towards me waved as a sign to hold the door, I called out, \"It's full.\" He looked at me bewildered as I was the only person he could see in the elevator, before sticking his hand out to stop the elevator from ascending. Huffing and puffing, he glared at me angrily before pressing his floor number for the door to close. Except the elevator pinged. The weight capacity light had turned on above our heads. \"Like I said, it's full.\" The man shook his head in amazement. Pressing his floor number again. The elevator pinged again, unwilling to budge. I sighed and got out, \"I'll wait for the next one.\"\n\nAnd wait I did, even in my room I waited for night fall instead of resting. The thoughts of a botched night wedding swirling in my head. For the many things that could go wrong. Because even though I had much practice in these matters, I was still always nervous before a fight. So when night fell, I was red eyed and exhausted, but better mentally prepared than before.\n\nBut when I arrived back at the scene of the crime, I was not prepared for all of the commotion.\n\n\"Ka-kin-eh Ka-kin-eh,\" a man shouted as the fire blazed.\n\nI grabbed one of the men running by with an empty bucket, \"What happened here?\"\n\n\"T-the villagers, they set the p-place on fire. Trying to rid the evil demon.\"\n\nI let him go and shook my head. The fools! I made my way toward the courtyard where I saw the detective from earlier moping his forehead as he was helping put out the fire. \"Detective! This is terrible,\" I yelled as the flames licked the night.\n\n\"No shit dumbass, it's a fire.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" I told him. \"Now the entity has nowhere to return. We may never find it.\"\n\nHe threw the bucket to the floor and whirled around, \"Enough! I've had enough! Listen here, there is a fire. F-I-R-E. This a real problem. If it catches to the fields, it could light the newly laid fertilizer on fire and catch the entire mountain!\"\n\n\"Detective!\"\n\nThat was the only word I had to say before he punched me. It was a dark night out, but stars had suddenly appeared. He hovered over me and I thought he would strike me again but then suddenly he froze. \"What is that?\"\n\nI turned my head and looked out into the field. The heat of the fire burning the back of my head as I tried to stop my nose from bleeding. \"Where?\"\n\nNeither one of us moved as we watched the tall field.\n\n\"Right there.\" He pointed.\n\nI reached up and threw his hand down, \"No! You never point at entities,\" I told him. \"Now you could be marked!\"\n\nHe ignored me and reached for his gun, \"Stop! Hey you! I order you to stop or I'll shoot!\"\n\nI looked into the field, scanning the endless rows before my eyes stopped and froze in horror. At one point in time the thing must have been a simple plastic mannequin. Standing in a department store perhaps. But now, it was twisted and gnarled. Its face beading and unrecognizable. The thing stood on all fours sometimes threes as it swayed slowly back and forth. It moved without form because it didn't have the constraint of joints as normal people as it was still objectively, plastic. It swung its arms behind it and used that as leverage to run, turning its head completely around - cracking the seams that had somehow still held and took off.\n\nThe detective rung a shot out at it. I think it struck but it didn't matter as the mannequin disappeared in the field. The detective must have lost his mind because he gave chase.\n\nI couldn't let him go alone so I followed. Pulling out my long yellow parchment as I wrote on it the symbols for sealing, hoping the simple spell would work. As we entered the tall field.\n\nIt was chaos. The ground was mushy beneath my feet, and the smell of fecal matter assaulted my senses further. In the brush I had lost the detective, so I was forced to tell my wives to help me locate his whereabouts. They didn't often leave my side, and some were reluctant but ultimately agreed.\n\nI stood in the field, waiting with bated breath as I heard further gunshots in the distance. I couldn't wait for my wives to gather as I tore after the detective. And just in time as I saw him standing, looking absolutely terrified as he shot blindly into the fauna until his pistol clicked. The mannequin lunged for him. But I got there first. Pushing him to the ground, causing both of us to tumble.\n\nHe was eating a mouth of dirt as I pulled him to his feet. \"We have to get out of this field! The ghost bride will pick us off in this thicket!\"\n\nStumbling, and running, and slipping as the two of us covered in more than mud. Several times we heard rustling nearby as if something were running alongside us. But eventually we made it out into the open plain. The detective trying to catch his breath as he reloaded his pistol.\n\n\"Shooting it doesn't work,\" he panted. \"But maybe I can disable it from moving.\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" I told him. \"Listen.\"\n\nHe stopped for a moment and we waited. Then all of the stalks before us shook wildly as if a hundred people were running through them. The detective raised his arm but I stopped him as my wives ran out of the field.\n\nThey were terrified as they ran right through us.\n\nI\u2019ve experienced the feeling before but the coldness of their ghostly forms going through our bodies like ice was enough to bring us both to our knees, clutching our chests as we struggled to breathe. I had passed through one or two in a row before. But never 10 or 20 at a time.\n\n\"What was that,\" the detective managed to gasp, his fingers in a death grip around his gun.\n\n\"A blue procession,\" I told him. \"Something caused all of my dead wives to flee.\"\n\nWe looked up as the leaves in front of us rustled.\n\n\"Is it...\"\n\nI shook my head, running forward to catch her. My 13th wife, Ah-ren. Her arm was missing, and a part of her shoulder. She was an innocent girl that had drowned when she was alive. Her innocence carried on with her to the afterlife where many souls generally grew up embittered. But never her, always sweet my girl, just weary of water.\n\n\"I didn't want to go,\" she told me.\n\n\"I know,\" I held her. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"It got some of the others too. But Meita got in its way and told me to run.\" She cried.\n\n\"Don't cry I told her. You know how you hate getting wet.\"\n\n\"I don't want to go. I wanted to stay with you. All of us together.\"\n\nI didn't even have the chance to say goodbye before her soul splintered and disappeared forever.\n\nI had never felt such fury. In all my years, a womanizer, a liar, a cheat at cards, a scoundrel, a bastard even. But an undutiful husband? Never.\n\nWithout thinking I approached the field and cast a spell that was forbidden.\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"I'm cursing the field. All beings alive or dead will forever feel displaced when they enter here. A feeling of unending dread and doom will overcome them, causing madness if they do not leave or are unable to.\" I reached into my side and threw a handful of salt. It landed on the ground as I chanted. The winds carrying it into the field, the small white morsels rolling obediently into the darkness.\n\n\"Nothings happening,\" the detective's word stuck in his mouth as a horrible scream echoed into the night. It sounded like two pieces of steel being twisted together.\n\n\"There,\" I took off after it. The jumbled figure of the mannequin charged out of the field and fled toward the village.\n\nWe followed it through the streets and between alleyways; the villagers screamed and hid when they saw it. We barged through home after home as we chased it. Until we cornered it at an abandoned building on the edge of town.\n\n\"It was supposed to be a mall,\" the detective told me. \"But the developers ran out of money.\"\n\nWe walked quietly into the empty building. Shells of stores stood in various degrees of construction. We checked a few of the empty fronts before venturing deeper inside.\n\n\"You've got to be kidding me,\" the detective said as we came near the center of the complex. There next to the escalators and the fountains was an army of mannequins of all shapes and sizes lined up like terracotta warriors. \"They must have stashed them all here when the place was being built, and forgot about them when it closed.\"\n\n\"There are hundreds.\"\n\n\"We'll go through together. Quickly and quietly.\" He added, \"Stay alert.\"\n\nWe moved through the rows, staring at all of the stuck faces, searching for one covered in grime and bullet holes. But it was more difficult than it sounded. Many of the mannequins were in bad shape, weathered, broken, laying in pieces on the ground. It was hard to tell if a pile of parts was indeed our culprit.\n\nSlowly we began to clear the rows and I could see the other side in sight.\n\n\"There!\" The detective shot his gun. The surrounding mannequins dropped like dominoes when the entity scattered. Falling down all around us, drowning us in a sea of plastic arms and smiling faces, I struggled to breathe as the debris settled. \"I think I'm stuck,\" I told the detective. But he wasn't listening, his eyes were concentrating on the only mannequin that was still moving. It began rushing toward us. He fired his gun blowing out one of the mannequin's knee caps. I hurriedly searched for my parchment. Another shot, another hit, but the scorned bride kept on charging unable to feel pain.\n\nIt jumped into the air and the detective blew the rest of its face away before he started screaming as the bride began to devour him. Pieces of his sinew was launched into the air as he was torn apart. I freed myself and rushed forward trying to help but the creature grabbed me by the throat and lifted me into the air. My feet scratching the ground as my lungs folded trying to breathe. The thing turned its head toward me and said, \"Will you marry me?\" As the darkness closed into the corners of my eyes.\n\nThe fight was leaving my body as I saw several of my wives rushing forward. Their ghostly forms bloodlusted as they began tearing at the mannequin, slowly pulling out pieces of her soul, causing the mannequin's arms and legs to go limp as they dragged her out of the corporeal form.\n\nI hit the ground and scrambled blindly with my fingers searching for my sacred parchment but could not find it amongst the rubble. I had no time to look further as the ghost bride was fleeing, leaving the shell of her mannequin in a heap on the floor. My wives chasing after her, screaming their fury at her for killing the others. For destroying their souls.\n\nI chased after them outside into the open air, where she had been cornered. She was crying as I approached, trying to escape into the Southwest wind. Begging for forgiveness. I knew what I should have done, but could not bring myself to do the right thing. Instead I bit my finger and drew symbols on my forearms with my own blood. Approaching the bride that never was and tore her soul into pieces.\n\nWhen I was done my wives sat down around me before slowly dispersing as the sun began to rise.\n\nA familiar voice came, \"We did it huh?\"\n\nI continued staring out into the horizon, \"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" the detective said before disappearing. \"Maybe in the next life I'll be sooner to trust you.\"\n\nLater they would find his body in the abandoned mall. Still clutching his gun. The department gave him a 21 gun salute at his funeral and a medal as commemoration. I was just glad that his soul had not been eaten.\n\nI, on the other hand, went back to the hotel. To the bar and ordered a well deserved drink. Where I saw a pretty woman sitting alone, \"Did you know that in order for me to pass on my Celestial title, I must bear an heir?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[s](https://www.reddit.com/r/CornerCornea/comments/u6rx8n/subscribe/)",

In all honesty, he might have lived if he was not so stubborn in his duty and chased after the rampaging spirit alongside you, but then you might have been in danger too if you went alone. You and him are both good men, and don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise, not even yourself. He made his choices as you made yours and you can't always be blaming yourself for the consequences of others' actions. You both did your best, and managed to put an end to the crisis.",

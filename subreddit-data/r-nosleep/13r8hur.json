I mentioned it in my previous post, but her recollections of her last moments aren\u2019t clear in the slightest.\n\nShe remembered most of the hike. She remembered seeing three people on the trail. One couple, two separate men, and also a lone woman. That made five total people. Of those five people she recognized not a single one.\n\nI wrote down descriptions of each.\n\nThe couple that she encountered was older. The man was stockier built but not out of shape. He was about 60 years old with white hair that contrasted his wife\u2019s still faintly blonde hair that was put up into a bun.\n\nOne of the lone men appeared to be in his thirties with short brown hair, a goatee, and arms as hairy as a chimpanzee\u2019s.\n\nThe other guy was younger. He was probably just out of college because he wore a brown and yellow UW hoodie. He kept the hood up, which concealed his hair color, but aside from that he had no distinctive features.\n\nThe woman was a young redhead who kept her hair in a tight ponytail. She didn\u2019t wear any distinctive clothing like the last guy, only generic athletic pants and a blue tank top with a white windbreaker to cover it.\n\nUnfortunately, none of the descriptions matched any of the people I remembered seeing on the trail that day. If one of them had, maybe we could have narrowed down the timeframe.\n\n\u201cWhen was the last time you checked your phone before the incident? That might narrow it down more than just that it happened in the morning.\u201d\n\n*I didn\u2019t take my phone on the trail. I never do.*\n\nI stopped myself from making the faux pas of telling her how dangerous it was to do that because that advice was literally less than useless now. She seemed to come to the same conclusion by finishing her thoughts with,\n\n*Well I never did, I should say.*\n\nA knocking at my door made me look up from the notepad I was writing the descriptions on. I was frozen. I didn\u2019t want to move. The knocking continued louder, accompanied by a yelling voice that I could not quite understand.\n\nHesitantly, I got up from my seat in my home office to check the front door. I looked through the peephole to see a police officer. A woman with blonde hair bound tightly into a bun. She called out again, asking if I was home.\n\nI opened the door and asked her what she needed.\n\nA few questions. Just a few questions which turned into a ride to the police station and before I knew it, I was sitting alone in an interrogation room. Not one like what you would see in a tv show, but more like a room the size of a walk-in closet with a single table and two chairs.\n\nThe lady had left me in the room with nothing but a cup of black coffee which I was not particularly keen on. That didn\u2019t stop me from drinking it, though, as the nerves of suddenly being taken to a police station had made me jittery and fidgety. I knew there were probably a few officers watching me on camera looking like a nervous wreck.\n\nNo doubt my jitteriness had caused me to look more guilty about finding a body on the side of a trail. Maybe it made my story about only calling once I got home seem more suspect. The more I dwelled on the thought of myself looking guilty the more nervous and unstable I got and the more guilty I made myself appear. It was a cruel, cruel cycle.\n\nThe cycle was broken when the blonde woman reappeared at the door. She held her own cup of coffee in one hand and a clipboard in the other.\n\nShe greeted me by name as she sat down.\n\n\u201cAm I being interrogated?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWoah, there. Calm down, okay. I\u2019m just here to ask you a few questions.\u201d\n\nA million thoughts ran through my brain about how I should ask for a lawyer or ask to leave or if I\u2019m under arrest or whatever or whatever. What my dumb ass ended up saying was,\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t wanna sound guilty.\u201d\n\nMy face immediately flushed. The lady looked at me for a moment with squinted eyes.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not really very good at talking to people. I never have been and I just don\u2019t want to be implicated with committing murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho said anything about murder?\u201d she asked.\n\nOh fuck, I thought. I forgot that the body was reported as being a victim of an animal attack. I couldn\u2019t exactly explain to the officer that the ghost of the dead body had followed me home and specifically told me that she was murdered.\n\n\u201cThe body?\u201d I said, doing my best to sound ignorant. \u201cThe one I found. Wasn\u2019t it a murder?\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me again how you found the body. You said on the phone call to 911\u2026\u201d\n\nShe looked through a transcript of the call on her clipboard.\n\n\u201cYou said the body was off the side of the trail and you passed it going by.\u201d\n\nOnce again her gaze was on me. Her eyes stared into mine, causing me to break eye contact almost instantly.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t find the body on the side of the trail. The body was pretty far off the trail actually. I was just wondering how you were able to stumble across it so easily when you weren\u2019t looking for it. Especially since we couldn\u2019t find it for a good while with so many people very actively searching it out.\u201d\n\nI wanted to tell her, oh yeah I was just walking when I heard the ghost of the dead body call out to me so it was pretty easy to find.\n\n\u201cThe smell,\u201d is what I actually said. \u201cI smelled it. Must have been caught by the wind.\u201d\n\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the lady bemused. \u201cI don\u2019t usually go searching for the sources of awful smells. To each their own, I suppose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just had a feeling. I just felt that something was off.\u201d\n\nWith a final scribble of notes on her page, she got up, said goodbye and told me to hang around a bit longer.\n\nI wanted to demand I be let go. I wanted to just get up and leave on my own. But the nerves kept me glued to the chair. The nerves were awful and only got worse when I saw who came in the room next. A man in his thirties. His jaw was covered in the scruff of a brown goatee. And once he sat down across from me, I confirmed it. Hairy arms just like a chimpanzee.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, darlin\u2019? You look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u201d\n\nI snorted at the irony.\n\nHe stared at me. He dared me to look him in the eyes but I refused to.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a pretty little thing aren\u2019t you?\u201d He said. \u201cI bet you couldn\u2019t hurt a fly even if you wanted to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could hold my own,\u201d I said, shyly.\n\n\u201cCould you? I don\u2019t think you killed that girl. She was a pretty little thing just like you. But you know what? She couldn\u2019t defend herself when the time came. I don\u2019t think you could either.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTake a look at that,\u201d he interrupted. He slid a photograph across the table. It was of the young woman who had been slaughtered. An image of the spirit I had talked to in my home.\n\n\u201cPoor little, Alice. She should be a reminder to you, huh. A reminder that pretty little things can get hurt. That they do get hurt pretty often now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\n\nFor once I looked into his eyes. His beady, cold eyes.\n\n\u201cMaybe you should be thankful that we\u2019re here to help you. Otherwise what\u2019s stopping that thing from coming after you too?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to leave.\u201d I demanded. \u201cI have rights and I\u2019d like to leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, darlin\u2019. I\u2019ll drive you home.\u201d\n\nMy heart sank. Whatever happened, I did not want that man finding out where I lived.\n\n\u201cNo. I want the other lady to take me.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s off the clock, sweetheart. It\u2019s either me, or a long walk.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m a hiker. It\u2019s a good thing because that creep was right about one thing; it was a very long walk back home. The misty mountain air had turned into a light rain with sweeping gusts.\n\nI kept the hood of my windbreaker up, and did not put in my airpods. I wanted to be completely aware of my surroundings. I checked every car that drove by. My heart sank every time the noise of one crept up.\n\nI saw nobody the entire way home. I was almost relieved until when I got to my front door, I heard the ghost of Alice say to me,\n\n*That\u2019s him. That\u2019s the guy.*\n\nI looked over my shoulder and saw him.\n\nInside of a silver car on one end of my cul-de-sac stared back the familiar beady eyes of the police officer from the station.\n\nHe waved with a wicked smile. Then he drove away.\n\nI locked my door immediately. I checked every window. Eventually I started crying on the couch clinging to a kitchen knife in one hand and my phone in the other.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to do. Who do you call when the person hunting you is the police?\n\nOnly then did I realize how dangerous this had become. As Alice tried to comfort me, I wondered,\n\nHow long until I end up like her?\n\nPart 3\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13u95d4/ive\\_been\\_able\\_to\\_hear\\_the\\_voices\\_of\\_ghosts\\_for/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3",

Leave a forwarding address as a PO Box, in a different town than the one you move to. I was stalked by a cop for 3 years; Their buddies on the force will help them. When you move, never introduce yourself by your real name, due your hair and cut/style it differently, it also helps to gain or lose a few lbs so you have a slightly different body type. It\u2019s wild what one has to go thru to get rid of a stalker\u2014let alone one who\u2019s a cop.",

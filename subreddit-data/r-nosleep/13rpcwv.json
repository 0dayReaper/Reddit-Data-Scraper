    "postText": "I blinked a moment at the enigmatic subject line of the email that had just come in from Allen, an old friend that I hadn\u2019t heard from in a few years.\r  \nDo you see it?\r  \nWhat was that supposed to mean?\r  \nTo be honest, I was surprised to see an email from him at all. We\u2019d always been more inclined to pick up the phone and talk if the urge to catch up with each other ever arose. Sending an email out of nowhere was unusual. Actually, it had probably been more than a year since we\u2019d even connected, so it was definitely unexpected to see the email in my inbox.\r  \nEven more so, one with such a cryptic subject line. It didn\u2019t become much clearer when I clicked on the email, either, bringing up only a single sentence in the message body.\r  \nPlease tell me I\u2019m not crazy. \r  \nI grinned a little, thinking to myself that, based solely on this email, I wasn\u2019t so sure I could provide him with that reassurance right now. I was about to pick up my mobile and give him a call, despite the late hour, when I noticed the image file attached to the email.\r  \nOkay, I was now a little curious.\r  \nI opened the file and found myself faced with what looked like a still-frame image captured from a night-vision surveillance camera. The view was that of a backyard, neatly adorned with carefully trimmed hedges, a small metal shed, and a few children\u2019s toys scattered about on the manicured lawn. I could just make out the dim shape of a swing set protruding into the camera\u2019s field of view to the side. \r  \nThe yard was fenced in with a wooden privacy fence and appeared to border a treeline of some sort. It might have been a forest or maybe just a small swath of trees; I couldn\u2019t really tell from the picture, but from the dense and pregnant shadows, I got the impression it was more likely the former.\r  \nI frowned as my eyes scanned over the image, trying to understand exactly what it was that Allen was wanting me to look at. The timestamp on the lower right corner of the image indicated that it had been captured at 2:15AM the previous day.\r  \n\u201cWhat am I supposed to be seeing here?\u201d I wondered aloud, grabbing my reading glasses and leaning closer to the screen. I zoomed in as far as I could before it started to pixelate and distort, but still didn\u2019t see anything out of place. \r  \nMy eyes drifted across the grainy image, the pale green monochrome of the night vision mixing with the visual artifacts and making everything a little unsettling and almost surreal, despite the otherwise excruciatingly ordinary scene. I squinted and leaned closer, wondering if there was something obvious that I was supposed to be picking up on. Still, nothing caught my eye.\r  \nFinally, I shook my head and leaned back in my chair. Whatever I was supposed to be looking at was eluding me.\r  \nHell, maybe this whole thing was some sort of oddball joke I just didn\u2019t get. Allen had never really been wrapped that tight, if I\u2019m being honest. Nice enough guy and a good friend, sure, but he was what a lot of folks would call, \u2018eccentric\u2019. I can\u2019t remember how many times I\u2019d seen him with an antique book he\u2019d found in a secondhand shop, usually with archaic subject matter bordering on the slightly disturbing. \r  \nI remember one time, he\u2019d excitedly shared with me a heavy leather-bound and time-worn book he\u2019d found on some internet auction site for obscure book collectors. I don\u2019t remember the title, but it had been written in what looked like Arabic script and he kept going on about some guy named Yazid or something like that. I only remember the name because he wouldn\u2019t stop talking about it for weeks. He\u2019d told me that he\u2019d been trying to get his hands on the book for years and had paid five thousand bucks for it.\r  \nFive thousand bucks. I shit you not.\r  \nSo yeah, that was Allen.\r  \nAs soon as the thought that this was some sort of prank entered my mind, though, I summarily dismissed it as a possibility. It was just too far out of character for him.\r  \nI was reaching for my phone and was getting ready to dial his number when I realized how late it was \u2013 almost 1AM. It was far too late to call him now, I thought. He was obviously still awake, as he\u2019d just sent me the email, but I didn\u2019t want to wake up his wife or kids, especially on a weeknight. I\u2019d call him tomorrow after work and try to figure out what this was all about.\r  \nAt this point, it was more of a curiosity than anything else, but a warning voice in the back of my mind was whispering that something wasn\u2019t right.\r  \nI was getting ready to shut off the laptop and head to bed myself, already pushing the strange email from my thoughts; I had been doing some work research and had lost track of time. I could feel my eyes growing heavy and almost hear the call of my pillow from the other room. Besides, I still had work in the morning and I knew I\u2019d regret it when my alarm went off at 6. \r  \nWith a resigned sigh, I switched off the desk lamp and was reaching to close the lid of my computer when my mobile phone abruptly rang. The sudden assault of the ringer in the otherwise silent and darkened house startled me more than I care to admit, and when I looked at the display, I was only mildly surprised to see Allen\u2019s caller-ID. I quickly pressed the button to accept the call.\r  \n\u201cAllen. Hey there \u2013 long time no talk,\u201d I said, trying to sound far more enthusiastic than I felt. Allen had been a close friend for many years, but we\u2019d drifted apart as family and careers took their toll on us. Well, his family and my career, I suppose is more accurate. \u201cI was just looking at the email you-,\u201d I started, but he cut me off, his voice strained and clearly stressed.\r  \n\u201cDo you see it?\u201d he asked, an urgency in his voice that was almost pleading. \u201cTell me you see it, Nick.\u201d\r  \nI hesitated, starting to feel a little uncomfortable. I still had no idea what he was talking about, but his demeanor set me on edge. \u201cI looked at the image you sent me, but I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m supposed to be looking at, if I\u2019m being honest. If you\u2019re trying to show off your landscaping skills, you\u2019re probably better off waiting for daylight to take a picture,\u201d I replied, trying to lighten the tone.\r  \nHe fell silent a moment, his ragged breathing the only sound coming through the phone, tinny and thin. I could tell he was trying to calm himself, trying to muster control over what almost felt like panic.\r  \nThe line was quiet for so long that I felt I needed to say something to break the spell. Just as I opened my mouth, however, he spoke again. This time, his voice was calmer and low.\r  \nMan, he sounds tired, I thought.\r  \nWorn thin.\r  \n\u201cOpen the image again,\u201d he said.\r  \nMy hand was moving to the mouse before I even realized it. I didn\u2019t reply as I opened his email and then the JPEG file. Once again, my screen was filled with the grainy, green-toned night-vision capture.\r  \n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s open. Now what?\u201d\r  \n\u201cLook at the fence,\u201d he urged me.\r  \nI did, my eyes falling once again on the wooden privacy fence bordering the yard. It looked the same as before \u2013 just an old, cheap fence that was probably due for replacing before too long.\r  \n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, drawing the word out like I was waiting for the punch line.\r  \n\u201cDo you see it?\u201d he asked, that same frustrating question that I\u2019d been struggling against since I received his email. \r  \nWhy the hell was he playing these unnecessary pronoun games? Why was he being so ambiguous? If there was something he wanted me to look at, why not just come out and\u2026\r  \nMy thoughts fell away as my eyes settled on something in the picture, something I hadn\u2019t caught before. Something I wouldn\u2019t have seen if Allen hadn\u2019t been so insistent. \r  \nThere appeared to be a shape rising above the fence in the corner of the yard, just within the shadow of the woods. At first, I thought it was just one of the trees, but it didn\u2019t quite look right. The more I scrutinized it, the more my mind began to seek out patterns, interpreting it as something more than an encroaching and oddly shaped tree.\r  \nIf I squinted and focused hard enough, I could almost imagine it as something more.\r  \nSomething alive.\r  \nI couldn\u2019t make out any detail \u2013 if, in fact, there were any details to make out \u2013 but I had the impression of something vaguely human-shaped, tall and thin and twisted. \r  \nAt this point, though, I felt pretty confident that this was nothing more than my brain trying to find order in chaos, searching out and creating familiar shapes in the image. \r  \nPareidolia, I think it\u2019s called. I\u2019d read an article on it a while ago, about how our brains are wired to seek out familiar images in ambiguous visual patterns. It\u2019s why people see the Virgin Mary in water stains on a wall, or Elvis in a piece of burned toast. Apparently, human brains don\u2019t like visual chaos. They\u2019re constantly trying to rationalize everything we see, even if there\u2019s not really anything there.\r  \n\u201cUm, yeah, I guess,\u201d I said finally. \u201cYou mean the tree on the other side of the fence \u2013 the one in the corner near the shed, right? It\u2019s definitely weird looking, but I don\u2019t understand-\u201d\r  \nAllen cut me off again. \u201cIt\u2019s not a tree,\u201d he hissed, sounding like he was almost trying to convince himself as much as me. I could hear some frantic clicking of a keyboard in the background and a few moments later, another email appeared in my inbox.\r  \nI clicked on the attachment without direction this time. The scene was similar, but the timestamp on this image was from shortly after midnight tonight, less than an hour ago.\r  \nMy eyes immediately sought out the same location that I had seen the shape, but now I frowned in confusion. \r  \nThe shape was gone.\r  \nNo, not gone. Moved. \r  \nI found it a moment later, this time inside the fence line on the other side of the image. It was partially obscured by the hedges, but I could see enough.\r  \nMore than enough to feed my nightmares for the rest of my life, however long that may be.\r  \nMy eyes widened and my breath caught as I studied the image, trying to understand what I was looking at. Though my mind kept trying to reject it, I couldn\u2019t help but return to the same conclusion over and over again \u2013 it was real.\r  \nIt had the general shape of a man, but impossibly tall and malformed. It\u2019s head and entire body were mostly featureless and looked almost like they were woven from dead and brittle vines and thin tree limbs \u2013 almost like something you\u2019d expect to find at some rural craft fair during Halloween. The head was elongated and narrow, and two small glowing beads of dark light, deeply set within the tangle of sticks and vines, reflected back in the infrared sensors of the security camera.\r  \nIts mouth, or at least what looked like it might have been a mouth, hung hideously wide and slack, as if the jaw had been dislocated and stretched far beyond its limits. I couldn\u2019t see any other features in the woven nightmare of sticks that made up its horrifying caricature of a face, but those pinpoints of reflection where the eyes should have been sent a chill down my spine. I would have sworn they were looking directly at the camera.\r  \nNo, not just at the camera. \r  \nAt me.\r  \nIts limbs were grotesquely long, its arms ending in a perverse imitation of fingers or claws that nearly brushed the ground. The thing towered far taller than any human ever could have, and as tall as it was, its back was hunched over, one shoulder drooping lower than the other, and the entirety of it seemed covered in a viscous, amber-tinted sludge. I could almost imagine it dripping across the ground with each shuddering footstep. \r  \nIn an instant, I found myself on my feet, my desk chair banging into the wall behind me. My eyes were fixed on the image.\r  \n\u201cWhat the hell is that, Allen?\u201d I cried out, feeling my heartbeat hammering in my chest, hearing the pulsing in my ears. \u201cThis has to be some sort of set-up, right? Tell me this is a joke. Is this some new fucked-up sculpture that Chloe built?\u201d\r  \nMy friend was silent for a long moment, but I thought I could sense a cautious hopefulness sweep over him. When he spoke, his voice trembled so badly that I could barely understand his words. \u201cYou see it! Tell me you see it!\u201d \r  \n\u201cOf course I fucking see it,\u201d I said harshly, an abrupt and irrational sense of terror running its cold fingers down my face, the feeling of blood draining away. \u201cBut what is it?\u201d\r  \nHe inhaled deeply and then his breaths came in little ragged puffs, almost like he was suppressing a nervous laugh.\r  \n\u201cThank God,\u201d he breathed, and now I was sure I could hear an anxious anticipation in his voice. It sounded like he was on the verge of tears. I heard furious typing on his keyboard and then what sounded like quiet, relieved, sobbing. \u201cIt\u2019s gone. Oh, thank you, God!\u201d\r  \n\u201cAllen? Allen!\u201d I repeated, still standing and aware of the fact that I had moved several more steps away from my laptop \u2013 from that thing in the picture that was still occupying my screen. It\u2019s eyes were still fixed on the camera, and though I had subconsciously moved a few steps to the right when I retreated, somehow they seemed to have shifted a bit, as if to follow my movements.\r  \nBut that was impossible, of course \u2013 an optical illusion, nothing more. This was just a still-frame from Allen\u2019s security cameras. It was a static JPEG image.\r  \nIt was almost another minute before he finally collected himself enough to respond to me, and when he did, there was something shadowy and secret hidden behind his words. Something that only added to my own growing anxiety. I couldn\u2019t place it, but I knew something was wrong.\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s gone, Nick. Thank you! Thank you so much! I knew I could count on you. It\u2019s been so long, but I knew you\u2019d still be able to help me.\u201d he said, his words falling over each other in a tumble. His breath was hitching as he spoke, but it wasn\u2019t fear or desperation anymore. It was relief \u2013 immense, immeasurable, relief. \r  \nI had no idea what he was talking about.\r  \n\u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s gone? Help you with what? Allen, you need to start making sense, and I mean right fucking now,\u201d I almost shouted. I was far past tolerating his half-sentences and word games. I wanted answers.\r  \nI needed to know what the hell this was all about.\r  \nWhen he spoke again, his voice was quieter.\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Nick. I really am,\u201d he said, and I didn\u2019t miss the color tinting his voice this time.\r  \nWhat was it? It almost sounded like remorse.\r  \nOr guilt.\r  \n\u201cI have a family, Nick \u2013 Chloe, Rick, and little Emily. Chloe\u2019s pregnant again, as a matter of fact. I have to protect them, no matter what,\u201d he continued, sounding almost manic as the words poured from my phone. \u201cYou would have done the same, I know it. Anyone would have done the same. You\u2019re a good man, Nick. Thank you for saving my family.\u201d\r  \nFrustrated and still not understanding exactly what he was rambling on about, I decided that I was done looking at whatever this was in the image he\u2019d sent me. With a quick step, I moved to the laptop and closed the image. In its place, the original file still stood open, showing the first capture he\u2019d sent me.\r  \nI moved the mouse to close that one as well, but froze as my eyes involuntarily sought out the thing that had been hiding just beyond the fence line. \r  \nIt was gone.\r  \nNumbly, I retrieved my desk chair with one hand, pulling it close and sitting without taking my eyes from the screen.\r  \nFrantically scanning the image again, my eyes kept trying to find the figure in the tree line. \r  \nNothing.\r  \nNothing but trees and shadows.\r  \nI rubbed my eyes and looked again. It wasn\u2019t possible; this was a static image \u2013 it couldn\u2019t just change.\r  \nBut no matter how much I argued with myself, the proof was right in front of me. I was now looking at a completely nondescript picture of Allen\u2019s backyard through his security camera. \r  \nNothing was out of place.\r  \nNo nightmare horrors from the pit, no eldritch creatures clawing their way from the shadowed tree line to prey on the innocent and unaware.\r  \nNothing.\r  \nAllen had been quiet for a while and when I took the phone from my ear, I saw the call had ended. I didn\u2019t bother trying to call him back. I knew he wouldn\u2019t answer. \r  \nI set the phone on my desk and looked over my shoulder at some small, innocuous sound. \r  \nI suddenly felt very alone in my house. The doorway beyond my office was cast black in deep shadows, and the solitude and isolation were palpable. The wind picked up outside briefly, whistling through the woods behind my property. A few moments later, I heard the growing hiss of the coming rain as it swept through the darkened woods.\r  \nI sat in silence for a long moment, eyes fixed on the curtain-covered window across the room that looked out upon my lawn and into the dense trees beyond.\r  \nIt took me a while to piece things together, but I think I have it figured out now. I hurriedly typed this post and uploaded it. I\u2019m not sure how much time I\u2019ve got left, so I just need for you to answer one question for me.\r  \nDo you see [it?](https://preview.redd.it/pb0x66vur02b1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c69a79f452e9e2fe57f8c623a7295a77defbfa10)\n\n[\\&gt;.&lt;](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_JIsvWfQr41ant2OGjmJkg)",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve always had a weak heart.\n\nNot just physically, I\u2019ve always been afraid of my own shadow. It was unsurprising when the doctors told me my heart murmur wasn\u2019t just a heart murmur. A year of tests. A year of therapy, constant trips to the hospital and I was finally told that it had all been for nothing.\n\nMy poor weak heart wouldn\u2019t last till Christmas. It\u2019s a strange thing being told that you\u2019re dying; I didn\u2019t come to terms with it at first. I drank and I spent my money. I did reckless, stupid things because I was so damn scared.\n\nThen I got the news. That a young woman called Laura had been declared brain dead and that I, the lucky chosen one, would be getting a brand new heart a week later. I drove to the hospital slowly, carefully, and readied myself for the ordeal that was to come.\n\nAs I was laying in bed on the last night, the thought of Laura swirled around in my head and it wouldn\u2019t leave me alone. It was like her name was in flashing lights every time I closed my eyes.\n\nIt was wrong, I know it was, but I had to see the woman who was giving me her heart. It didn\u2019t feel right not to put a face to the one who was saving my life. I knew her name, I knew what ward she was staying on- I had overheard the two nurses discussing it. I wandered down the meandering hallways until I found what I was looking for, taking my time, making sure I didn\u2019t miss any name. I guess I had time on my hands now.\n\nIn the second to last room, she lay in bed. A woman sat on the bed next to her, holding her hand, and my own weak heart stuttered.\n\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d I had no idea what to say to her. \u201cI\u2019m Jenna. I\u2019m the person\u2026 I\u2019m having surgery tomorrow and..\u201d What I assumed was Laura\u2019s mother stood up and I could tell from the look in her eye that she knew who I was.\n\n\u201cThank you for visiting. I know it\u2019s strange, but a part of her is going to be living on in you. I wanted to meet you.\u201d I stood there, helpless and lost for words. Laura\u2019s mother beckoned me over.\n\n\u201cPlease.\u201d She said. \u201cDon\u2019t feel uncomfortable. Its what she would have wanted.\u201d I sat on the chair next to Laura.\n\n\u201cHow did she-\u201c I broke off. It was too awful to ask. Laura\u2019s mother gave me a thin smile.\n\n\u201cShe was a care worker. Looked after battered wives, abused women. Last month she met a guy and\u2026 Well. I suppose years of training can\u2019t help you when you\u2019re in love. She ignored the warning signs. And he killed her. She dedicated her life to those who needed her.\u201d Laura\u2019s mother looked down. I don\u2019t know why I did it, but I reached over, and held Laura\u2019s hand. I squeezed it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I had a boyfriend once who\u2026 He was like that too. Someone like Laura convinced me to leave.\u201d Laura\u2019s mother gave me another half smile. I could see the tears in her eyes.\n\nThen Laura squeezed my hand. Tightly. She gripped me so hard that her fingernails dug into my skin. I recoiled, a look of horror on my face. Laura\u2019s mother looked at me calmly.\n\n\u201cShe squeezes my hand sometimes as well. I think the Doctors called it muscle spasms. Either way. There\u2019s none of Laura left in there anymore.\u201d I looked at the small crescent moons that had just started to bleed on the palm of my hand.\n\nThe surgery went perfectly. I was wheeled to the recovery suite after it was over and done with, the raised wound on my chest covered by gauze. It was better if I didn\u2019t see it, I thought. I didn\u2019t need any more heart issues. I spent the first day doped up on the pain medication, eating only a little and sitting up maybe two times. It was a long process, they reassured me.\n\nLaura\u2019s mother came to visit me the day before I was due to leave. Her calm demeanor hadn\u2019t wavered but I could see that she was suffering. She looked ten years older, and her hands shook when she gave me a hug.\n\n\u201cWhen are you going home?\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow.\u201d I told her. \u201cPlease, come visit whenever you want.\u201d I started to jot down my address for her, when out of the corner of my eye, a flash of blonde disappeared through the doorway. The same brilliant blonde as Laura\u2019s hair.\n\n\u201cOw!\u201d I cried out suddenly. It felt like someone had sharply squeezed my hand so hard it had almost crushed the bones. Laura\u2019s mother rushed to my side, a look of concern in her eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is it your heart?\u201d She stumbled over the last words, coming to terms with what she had said. I tried to reassure her and said I\u2019d let the doctors know, and she left with a look of worry on her face.\n\nWhen I looked down, a new set of crescent fingernail marks were below the ones that Laura\u2019s had made. Ten identical bleeding smiles.\n\nThe taxi ride home was short, and before I knew it I was back in my own flat. It felt strange to try and slot back into where I had left off, my life had been almost over the last time I had been here. I looked over the mess and the cardboard boxes, the remnants of one night where I had tearfully tried to pack and store my belongings so my parents wouldn\u2019t have to do it when I died.\n\nLaura\u2019s heart beat so strongly it felt like it would come out of my chest. It did this all the time, and I realized this was what a healthy heart must feel like. So why couldn\u2019t I shake my feeling of unease?\n\nThat night, I had a dream.\n\nLaura was in her hospital bed, but her mother was gone. I could hear my heart, Laura\u2019s heart, beating in my eardrums so loudly it was painful. I tried to cover them, but my hands were pinned to my sides. Some unexplainable force was moving me towards the motionless figure of Laura on the bed, her lips were blue and the window had come open, whipping her blonde hair around her face.\n\nI was almost on top of her when her eyes flew open.\n\nThey were milky white, the eyes of someone dead.\n\n\u201cGet out.\u201d She rasped, her voice guttural. I could hear the heartbeat faster and faster, drumming until I thought I couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\n\nThen I woke up. The sound had been real. Laura\u2019s heart was so loud it felt like it would rupture my eardrums and I screamed in agony, trying to cover my ears. It was useless, it was coming from some deep place inside me, I could feel it reverberating around the hollows of my chest.\n\nI stumbled out of bed, gasping for air, and tried to find my phone. I needed to call someone, anyone, an ambulance or my mom. Anyone that would pick up.\n\n\u201cGet out.\u201d It was a faint whisper over the hammering thumps of Laura\u2019s heart, a low guttural voice that sounded like it had been made by an animal, and I crawled to the door, down the hallway, choking on my screams for help. My neighbor opened the door, his eyes as wide as saucers at the sight of me on the floor clutching my chest.\n\nHe drove me to hospital as I cried in the passenger seat of his car.\n\nAfter about fifty different checkups, the doctors told me that absolutely nothing was wrong with me. They told me my heart was regular, my blood pressure was normal, and that everything was going just swimmingly. I stood in the waiting area, wallowing in my shame and frustration.\n\nThat heart didn\u2019t belong to me.\n\nMy phone buzzed on the counter, an unknown number. Great. That was all I needed, more unexplained, scary things like a stranger on the end of the phone. My voice sounded small on the line,\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood morning, this is the Thames Valley police, we\u2019ve called to report an incident that occurred in your flat at around 1.30am today.\u201d I felt a wave of embarrassment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I recently had surgery and I wasn\u2019t feeling well. I had to have my neighbor drive me to the hospital and I think I panicked a little in the hallway before I left.\u201d There was a small silence on the other end of the phone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid this is something you might want to be sitting down for.\u201d I felt Laura\u2019s heart beats, strong and calm. \u201cThere was an incident of forced entry by Mr Samuel Matthews, according to our police records he\u2019s your ex partner and you filed a restraining order against him in September 2017.\u201d My blood ran cold.\n\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in police custody. We found an automatic weapon on him and we believe he had the intent to harm you. We have an officer currently stationed at your flat who can fill you in depending on how long your hospital stay will be.\u201d\n\nI thanked him and hung up the phone.\n\nFor a moment, I leant against the wall, the horror slowly spreading over me. If I had been in my flat ten minutes later he would have found me.\n\nLaura\u2019s heartbeats filled my ears again but now they were gentle, calming. Her mother said she dedicated every part of her to helping those who needed it.\n\nI put both my hands on my chest, overwhelmed by my own gratitude, and listened to Laura.",

            "comment": "Whoa, that gave me chills. I'm a kidney transplant recipient of 11 years. I do often think about the person who had to die to give me her kidney. Whenever I first got my transplant, I wrote her family a letter thanking them and they wrote back. The letters are all filtered through the hospital and names white-outed, but I could still read her name. I looked her up online and she died in a car accident on her way to work at a hospital one morning. She was married and had three kids. Being a transplant patient is this weird juxtaposition of feeling both incredibly thankful and happy to have a functioning organ again, but also guilty and sad that someone else had to die. ",

(Probably the only part of him healthy enough to be donated at all) He hadn't been listed as a donor but hadn't been listed as not wanting to be a donor either, so they had to get the next-of-kin's permission. My husband was a wreck at that time and kind of in shock at the call but in hindsight he's glad that he was contacted and he's glad that he gave the permission to go for it.",

I\u2019ve also been scared enough to take out a restraining order on another ex who was emotionally manipulative and went unhinged.

(FYI, that cow valve was still going strong, working great, when he died of something totally unrelated 15 years later, making me feel bad that i scoffed when we learned a cow valve has been used). So don't underestimate pig parts, either! \ud83e\udd23 Seriously, though, I hope surgery goes awesome and you feel amazing soon. I know what he had done wasn't as major but he was like a new man, like he was 20 years younger, after he had his surgery. They can do amazing things these days.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m writing this because I think I\u2019m in genuine danger. If I am found dead, Cole Miller did it.\n\nIt all started on a dating app. I was underage but that was allowed, on this particular dating app. Only fifteen. Swiping, swiping, swiping\u2026\n\nOof. He\u2019s cute.\n\nI swiped yes, to this boy with dark hair and light eyes; his bio also said he was fifteen. Perfect.\n\nWe hit it off. Talking every day. Friendship turned into dates.\n\nBut on those dates, this boy was completely different. He would make me uncomfortable. He would touch me in places that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with him touching; especially on the bus.\n\nHe wanted to be my boyfriend. I said no. He lost his shit at me. Anger, spitting, rage. Threatening me \u2014 that he would kill me one day.\n\nHe made friends with my friends, even though I had blocked him. Drove past my house, even though I hadn\u2019t ever told him the suburb I lived in.\n\n\u2018No Caller ID\u2019 calls were the norm for me. My mother, even answered a few. Asking him to leave me alone. But it was always the same threat, \u2018Remember, Maisie, I\u2019m gonna kill you one day.\u2019\n\nWe tried to report him to the police, but he had lied about his name. He did not exist. So they didn\u2019t do anything. \u2018Keep a diary and you might be able to get a restraining order one day\u2019.\n\nYears went by, and slowly, the calls faded away. The occasional text message here and there from fake numbers still occur, but I started to feel safe. No more unexpected presents that I have to ask the police to check for bombs. No more sitting in front of the TV, staring at the security camera monitors whilst I eat my dinner instead of watching my programme. No more waiting for my friends to message me, saying that they saw him and he spoke about how he\u2019s gonna kill me.\n\nI\u2019m twenty-two now. And for the first time, I feel safe.\n\nOr I felt safe. Until he served me my coffee at my regular coffee shop. I have been going there for a few weeks now. Every morning, I drive past and get a Grande Dirty Chai. \n\nBut the worst part is, I don\u2019t live in Tampa anymore. I live in Vero Beach. Two and a half hours away from Tampa. Did he follow me here? He must\u2019ve. He must\u2019ve. He must\u2019ve. \n\nHe knew my order. Even paid for it with a smile. \u201cOn the house, my love.\u201d He had said to me. I cringe thinking about it. But that doesn\u2019t stop my heart, feeling like it\u2019s about to pop out of my chest from the anxiety that I\u2019m feeling. \n\nOn the sleeve of the cup, he wrote a message. \n\n\u2018I\u2019ll see you soon xx\u2019. \n\nWhen I got home, I locked all the doors and windows of my house. I even locked my cat flap, ensuring that my two cats \u2014 Amelia and Hashbrown were inside. \n\nWhat if they\u2019re in danger too?\n\nMy hands shake at the thought of putting my pets in danger. I only got them because I felt safe enough to finally get them.\n\nI swallow forcefully, before getting out my phone. I should call the police, even though they don\u2019t typically believe me due to the fact that when an unexpected thud in the night occurs, I tend to be quite trigger happy with my phone.\n\nIt rings for a few moments, before an officer answers the phone.\n\n\u201cAh, Maisie, I recognised your number.\u201d He speaks, disgruntled by my phone call. \u201cWhat seems to be the problem, ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\nThe words fly out of my like vomit. \u201cHe\u2019s here. In Vero Beach. He served me today at the coffee shop and gave me this note saying that he\u2019s gonna see me soon and-\u2026\u201d\n\nThe officer on the other end heaves a big sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re right this time Maisie, maybe this something we should look into.\u201d He pauses and I can hear him taking a large sip of coffee. \u201cWe\u2019ll investigate in the morning. Until then, sit tight, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Officer, I\u2019m geniunely worried about my safety-\u2026\u201d And click. I hear nothing but faint buzzing from the other end. Did I just get hung up on by a cop? \n\nI pace back and forth in my kitchen, tapping my fingers against the tub that holds my largest knife. Wondering if I should have it in my hand, now. Just in case. I\u2019d have the best chance if I did.\n\nNo. You\u2019re just gonna scare yourself even more.\n\nI sigh to myself, pressing my hand on my forehead before I go to my rear sliding door. Ready to turn off the lights in the backyard, primarily to stop annoying my neighbours and so I stop obsessively staring out of there.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I see him. A smiling man in my back garden, with a large knife. Just standing there, smiling at me. He doesn\u2019t move. Almost like he\u2019s frozen. \n\nI reach for the phone again, but in that moment, I realise that the cops won\u2019t come. They think I\u2019m the girl who cried wolf. It\u2019s just going to be me, and Cole. \n\nGod, talk about a cliche scary movie. All you\u2019d need now is thunder and lightning. \n\nI can feel my heart pressed against my chest; almost as though it\u2019s about to break free.  But then it hits me, if I\u2019m going to die - this motherfucker isn\u2019t going to get away with it.\n\nSo, Reddit, this may be my last post. If I am found dead, Cole Miller did it.",

    "postText": "In the depths of the dimly lit factory where I work, a tiny crack in the wall near the floor lay hidden. It was within this crevice that an intricate web had been woven by a spider,  One fateful day, during a 15 minute break, my coworker Danny and I stumbled upon this arachnid's abode.\n\nCuriosity took hold of us, and we decided to engage in an unsettling experiment\u2014we would provide sustenance to the spider. We scoured the factory, plucking unsuspecting insects from every corner of the building, and delivered them to the patient predator. With each bug delivered, the spider grew stronger\n\nDays turned into weeks, and weeks into months. It became a spectacle at the workplace, a grotesque display of nature's macabre beauty. As the spider grew, so too did our audience, our coworkers gathering around to witness the spider feast.\n\nYet, as is the nature of such spectacles, its allure inevitably halted. The spider, once an object of morbid fascination, slipped into obscurity. We stopped seeing it in its web, and eventually our lives moved forward, the memory of the spider fading into the recesses of our minds.\n\n\nA year passed, and the factory found itself in need of an electrician. Enter Richard, Richard was an annoying presence from the get-go, pestering everyone with his incessant chatter and constant bad mouthing of anyone and everyone he knew.   It was on one such day, a day burdened by Richards unrelenting pestering, that our past transgressions returned to haunt us.\n\nDanny and I made the joyoust discovery that the spider had returned, our eyes widen with excitement as we had not seen our 8 legged friend in an entire year and now it's reclaimed its residence in the old web, but our rejoicing moment was shattered when we came to the realization Richard had followed us. Disgust contorted his features as he ridiculed our attachment to the spider. He then ruthlessly crushed the spider into the crack with a single, hateful stomp.\n\nVisibly shaken, our voices filled with rage, fueled by the knowledge that the spider had posed no threat. Little did we realize the horrors that awaited us.\n\nThe following day, we arrived at work, burdened with grief over the loss of our eight-legged friend. Yet, Richard was nowhere to be found. We reluctanly embarked on a search for him as a request by our boss, and that's when we stumbled upon a sight so horrifying it was seared into our minds.\n\nRichard's lifeless body hung suspended from the ceiling, grotesquely transformed into a human-sized cocoon. \nIt was then that the true horror began to dawn upon us. The minuscule crack in the wall was now a gaping chasm, as if malevolence itself had erupted from its depths.\n\n\nThe spider we believed had met its demise, extinguished by Richard's callous act, had not perished. No, it had merely given birth in the year it was gone, and it's offspring was the one that met it's demise. The spider we had originally fed continued to grow silently within the confines of the factory's walls throughout the passing year. From the shadows, it emerged\u2014a colossal arachnid\n\nThe monstrous creature, born from our unwitting arrogance, Its eight eyes gleamed with vengeful intent as it scuttled towards us, we braced ourselves for our inevitable end. But to our surprise, the spider halted just a few feet away from us. Its eight eyes surveyed us, as if assessing our worth And then, without warning, the spider scurried away, disappearing into the shadows of the now gaping chasm that was once a tiny crack in the wall.\n\nIn the end it seems Richard was just another insect that had been fed to our spider friend.",

            "comment": "Here from /r/spiderbro. Most spiders typically only respond to live prey. However, it sounds like your spider may be one of the Agelenidae or funnel-weavers, which make flat sheet webs\u2014indoors often found in dusty corners. E.g. [*Tegenaria domestica*](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/153507-Tegenaria-domestica), though possible species depend on your geographic location. \n\nSo, you might be able to feed it pre-killed prey, and \"trick\" it into eating by vibrating the web. With typical sized spiders one can use a battery-powered toothbrush, but being in a factory you could try using power tools (in such a way as not to destroy the web, of course). \n\nLuckily spiders have fairly slow metabolisms. At this size yours will probably behave more like a tarantula and may not need food for months. Just mist the web or nearby wall occasionally so it gets something to drink. /r/tarantulas or Arachnoboards can also provide you with care advice. Good luck!",

Depending on the area, you can buy half a butchered cow pretty cheap, you might even be able to find a farmer willing to sell whole, unbutchered.",

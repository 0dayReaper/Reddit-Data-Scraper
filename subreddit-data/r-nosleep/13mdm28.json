    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was pretty devastated when Clyde said he\u2019d gotten a job opportunity outside of the city. It was a high-paying journalism job\u2013well, high paying for journalism anyways\u2013 in a small town called Myre roughly four hours away.\n\nClyde was my best friend. We started out as middle school brats who hated each other. Then as I got to know we had lots in common, we became decent friends. We were inseparable in high school and college. I damn near saw him more than I saw my family at one point. We almost were family in a way.\n\nEven though I had time to cultivate other friendships, Clyde\u2019s departure left a hole in my heart. I started to hear from him less and less, and then after four months, he disappeared entirely.\n\nHe reached out to me recently, though I doubt I'll be able to hear from him ever again.\n\nIt was the end of a standard drunken bender, and I checked the mailbox in my apartment. Somehow, I managed to prioritize it instead of throwing up in the toilet.\n\nThere was a hefty package inside, and I pulled it out. I probably made a lot of noise in the process, too.It looked like a small treasure chest, and inside of it was a journal. The stench as I opened up the chest made me improvise on the toilet and I puked into the trash can nearby. It smelt like a corpse that had expired mustard coating it. Very unpleasant.\n\nWondering who shipped something so nauseating to me, I angrily flapped open the journal.\n\nI recognized Clyde\u2019s writing immediately.\n\nI left the rancid chest on the mailroom floor and hurried upstairs with the journal. I took a moment of post-sickness clarity and decided I would read it when I was sober, or at least hungover.The headache was definitely there in the morning, but it didn\u2019t deter me from reading my best friend\u2019s bundle of writing. I mean, if it was shipped to me, then I assume he\u2019d want me to read it, right?\n\nI flipped it open. I will share what was inside. The journalist in him would want you all to see it, too:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***April 19th,***\n\n*With issues coming from the radio tower today, Myre has no internet. So I'm going the old fashioned way. It\u2019s been nine days since I\u2019ve arrived, and my parents insisted on coming to visit me.* \n\n*They arrived this morning, and are already sticking their noses up at the state of this town. Snobby. I\u2019m stuck with them for a week, too.There\u2019s nothing wrong with folks who are a little bit different, at least they\u2019re friendly here.*\n\n*Though the radio tower incident is odd. I turn on any speaker, radio, boombox you name it, and all the channels are this humming sound I've never heard before. I hope it fixes itself soon.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***April 22nd,***\n\n*My parents seem to be adjusting in their short stay, though I\u2019d wish they\u2019d leave. I spent a good portion of the weekend fishing with dad just outside Myre. The tower is still upright in the distance, but I haven\u2019t seen anyone go up the hill to fix it.* \n\n*It\u2019s interesting, everyone in Myre seems to\u2026like the sound? I\u2019ve heard it blaring in stores, and even people outside are sitting on their porches or in their yard. Folks are still friendly, but quieter. Some of the storekeepers have even had the most unusual stutter. I can only imagine the snooty remarks my parents will say to their real estate buddies back home.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***April 25th,***\n\n*I woke up to the sound humming throughout the apartment. Mom and Dad seem to be loving the sound, and I gotta say, I barely even notice it. They\u2019re in great spirits and extended their stay for another week. They told me they hired a nanny to look after Lex. Bet she\u2019s JUST thrilled.*\n\n*What I have noticed however, is the lack of anybody going out. The streets are clear. I took a walk and saw nobody walking. Hell, even the convenience store was closed for no reason.I\u2019m drawn to the radio tower, and decided that I\u2019m gonna make a story on it. It\u2019ll be a good headline for this sleepy town*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***April 26th,***\n\n*Mom was sitting in the middle of the hallway at 3 in the morning. She was staring blankly at the little stereo that was at the end of the hall. I flicked the lights on and she snapped out of whatever trance she was in. Scared the crap out of me, honestly.*\n\n*Looking out the window later that day, I noticed our neighbor\u2019s windows were open. They looked like they were entranced, staring at what I can only imagine was a stereo.So I took a stroll and peeked in. Sure enough, just like how mom was, they were sitting, staring at a very old stereo.*\n\n *I tapped the window, and they snapped out of it, staring daggers at me.*\n\n*Mom seems to be getting cold and distant with me, and Dad still hasn\u2019t come back from fishing this morning. I\u2019m gonna go look for him. Mom claims he\u2019s fine, but keeps putting up that irritating shushing gesture with her finger everytime Ii bring it up. Does she not love him anymore?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***April 27th,***\n\n*I found Dad in the nearby pond where we were fishing. He was laying down in the boat, staring at a radio he had brought with him. He was so fucking sunburnt he had blisters on his face. It\u2019s been hot much earlier this year, but holy shit!* \n\n*When I snapped him out of it, we got into a bit of a spat. I threw the radio in the pond, and he punched me! Something\u2019s wrong with this.* \n\n*I tried calling for a technician and the phone just blared that stupid sound. My service is significantly weaker, too.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***April 30th***\n\n*Things have gotten pretty bad here. I\u2019m slowly losing my sanity.*\n\n *I don\u2019t know where to start.*\n\n*I snapped my neighbors out of their trance and they threw a trophy at me, shattering their own window. I ran for it.*\n\n*I saw a kid outside for the first time, she was pretty upset saying her parents keep eating \u201cthings\u201d including their pet cat.* \n\n*The kid seems coherent, I\u2019d call the cops if I could but I get nothing.*\n\n*The radio frequency has changed\u2026it\u2019s got what sounds like growls and murmurs in it, too.*\n\n*Mom and Dad have both stopped talking. They stopped bathing, too. I can\u2019t really communicate with them, they don\u2019t listen.*\n\n*Stores aren\u2019t open, so I broke into one to get some food. I found the clerk there, mindlessly swinging at the speakers playing the sound. He was an elderly man, probably hadn\u2019t eaten or bathed in days. I snatched some food and water, and left.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***May 1st***\n\n*My speech is going, I catch myself stuttering. What the fuck is going on?*\n\n*I\u2019m gonna investigate the tower and hitchhike out of here.*\n\n*Someone or something shut off the water and power. I\u2019ve been getting by bathing in the pond, and going into town to snatch food. Call me a criminal if you want to.*\n\n*I caught Mom eating a centipede off of the floor. Still unresponsive to me as I shrieked at the sight.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***May 2nd,***\n\n*I watched helplessly as Mom and Dad dove from the second floor balcony. I think Mom snapped her leg on the way down.*\n\n*I followed them, and they ran away from me. Mom didn\u2019t make a sound, either. Eventually, I ran outta stamina. I hate having asthma.* \n\n*Eventually I caught up to them, they halted themselves against a light post, holding each other. I heard them giggle and hum. They refused to move, and I was met with resistance trying to drag them away.*\n\n*I want to get the hell out of Myre, but I can\u2019t just leave them there.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***May 4th,***\n\n*They fucking ate her.*\n\n*The little girl I saw last week, my parents did it. I saw them on the side of the road, chewing on her remains. I recognized the polka dot shirt sticking out of dad\u2019s mouth.*\n\n*I attacked both of them, and they didn\u2019t even flinch. Mom\u2019s broken leg is swelling up, and she keeps licking it. Dad keeps picking at his fingers, the skin around his nail beds are pretty much gone.*\n\n*I\u2019m seeing people walking outside now. None of them respond to me, and they\u2019re all walking towards the radio tower. I don\u2019t see any children or pets, either. I can assume what\u2019s happened to them.*\n\n*I smashed every speaker, stereo, phone, anything that could play that sickening sound. I can barely talk, myself, but I still have my brain intact.*\n\n*I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna tell my sister, I think the nanny might have to stay a little longer.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***May 6th,***\n\n*Mom, Dad, and several other broken and starving people have congregated around the tower, sobbing. They have been there since last night.*\n\n*Every time I come into view, heads turn at me. They look at me, staring, and drooling.*\n\n*I can hear where the traffic is coming from outside of town. I\u2019m making a break for it.*\n\n *I\u2019ve deduced that this frequency coming from the tower affects people by their age. If they\u2019ve eaten all the kids and animals, I think I could be next.*\n\n*In a contingency, I\u2019m writing this out to your address, Bobby Bolton. Hopefully someone sees this package on the road should I meet my end.*\n\nThe last entry had red stains lining the paper. After turning over the journal I noticed the back was caked in what looked like dried blood:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***May 8th,****Bobby, you gotta tell Lex that we\u2019re gone. I\u2019m so sorry to put this on you.*\n\n*I made it to the highway, but I'm not the same man as before. I can\u2019t talk, god knows why.*\n\n*They all chased me as I left the town. Most of them dropped on all fours and barrelled towards me. Their noises were\u2026well i\u2019m not sure humans could even do that. I had no way of protecting myself, but their bodies began falling apart as they chased me. I saw Mom and Dad\u2019s skin wilt and tear as they chased me amidst the crowd.*\n\n*I didn\u2019t even notice, nor did I hear the oncoming military trucks until it was too late. Must\u2019ve been looking behind me all too much. They opened fire on everyone. I took some stray bullets. One tore off half my ear, probably popped a lung or something with the other. It hurts to breathe.*\n\n*They must\u2019ve presumed me dead or\u2026cursed like the rest of them. They went deeper into the town, probably to clean up the rest of it. They left me behind. I saw them take out the radio tower, too.*   \n\n*Whatever it is. I doubt you\u2019ll hear it on the news. Something tells me they\u2019ll cover it up. They\u2019re good at that.*\n\n*The only thing I hear is humming, and growling.*\n\n*Tell everyone you know to stay away from Myre. I doubt anything\u2019s standing by the time you get this. If you see this shitty, antique chest you better fucking open it. I was lucky to come by it in the ditch.*\n\n*Bobby, you showed me friendship that I\u2019ll cherish forever. I know you\u2019ll make more friends, and I hope you show them the kickass you that you showed to me.*\n\n*In the next life, we\u2019ll play all the games we want.*\n\n*In a way, I love you man.*\n\n*Clyde DuPont.*\n\nI cried for nearly two hours. I wanted to believe Clyde was alive, but nobody survives that shit without medical attention. I mourned my friend, I puked a few times, and curled into a pathetic ball.\n\nNow I\u2019m mentally preparing myself to see Lex, and bring her the horrifying news. I think I should take the journal with me. I don\u2019t want to break her heart, even though mine will be in pieces for a long time.\n\nIf you see a turn on the highway towards Myre, keep driving. [It\u2019s a dead town, and for all of our sakes, it should stay dead.](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowAwaytheCJ)",

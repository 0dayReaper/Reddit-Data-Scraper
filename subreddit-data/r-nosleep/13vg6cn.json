    "postText": "The fear of long words.\n\nYes, whoever coined such a long name for this phobia was cruel. I\u2019ve heard that joke a thousand times. But do you know what isn\u2019t funny? The story of *why* I fear long words. And it\u2019s a story that I\u2019m going to tell here in the hope that it makes people think twice before being callous. I can\u2019t speak for others with this phobia, of course, but I can tell you how it began for me.\n\nIt was 2005, and I was 10 years old. My friends and I were watching Mary Poppins. Amy, Stephanie, Brandon, my little brother, and me.\n\n\u201cSupercalifragilisticexpialidocious,\u201d I proudly said, pointing at the piece of paper on which I\u2019d just written the word.\n\nAmy beamed. \u201cYou\u2019re so smart, James!\u201d\n\nI caught Brandon eyeing her coldly, but I pretended not to notice. I just thought him to be troubled. Unloved at home by his drunken dad. Envious of my relationship with Amy. Angry at the world. All of the above.\n\nBut there was more to Brandon than that. Or less, depending on how you look at it. And however you look at it, what happened next was a horror beyond words. In fact, after all of this time, I\u2019ve finally decided that there isn\u2019t a word for what happened next. And I know plenty of words. That\u2019s what started everything.\n\n\u201cJames,\u201d Brandon said as we were walking out of school. \u201cWhat would you say to a Spelling Bee at my house?\u201d\n\nI shrugged. \u201cSure. I guess.\u201d\n\nHe was quiet for the duration of the walk home. As I said, he was always an unusual, unnerving boy, but I have to admit that he seemed particularly unhinged on this particular evening. I noticed that his driveway was empty as we approached the front door.\n\n\u201cDo your parents know I\u2019m coming over?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go up to the den,\u201d He said, averting my question and guiding me upstairs.\n\n\u201cAre we allowed, Brandon?\u201d I asked, as he pulled on the string to the attic door. \u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re away,\u201d Brandon said, beginning to climb the ladder. \u201cCome on. It\u2019s time for the Spelling Bee.\u201d\n\nHe turned on the light in the attic, and I followed him into what I can only describe as the first of many traumatic memories. Chained to plastic chairs \u2013 yes, chained by a 10-year-old \u2013 were my friends and my brother. Stephanie, Amy, and Tom. They were all crying.\n\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d I squealed. \u201cLet them go!\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you not wonder where everyone had gone during our lunch break, James?\u201d Brandon asked. \u201cI thought you were smart.\u201d\n\n\u201cJames,\u201d Tom bawled. \u201cI want to go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna untie you,\u201d I said, striding towards his chair. \u201cOne second.\u201d\n\nBut Brandon lunged at me, pinning me to the rickety floorboards of the attic and wafting a multi-buttoned remote before my eyes.\n\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t how the Spelling Bee works, James,\u201d Brandon hissed, dark eyes burrowing into my soul. \u201cIf you step out of line again, I press this button and\u2026 You don\u2019t want to know what it does to your friends and poor little Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not little\u2026\u201d Tom whimpered.\n\nBrandon leaned towards my ear and whispered quietly. \u201cBy the time we\u2019re finished, he\u2019ll be the littlest thing you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust tell me what to do,\u201d I cried.\n\nBrandon smiled wickedly. \u201cThree words. That\u2019s it, James. The world\u2019s easiest Spelling Bee. A word for each of them \u2013 Stephanie, Amy, and Tom. Spell each word correctly, and I set them free.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if I fail?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a pass or fail situation, James. You\u2019ll spell each word, letter by letter. As soon as you get a letter incorrect \u2013 sorry, *if* you get a letter incorrect \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you the correct letter and repeat the word so you can continue.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what\u2019s the catch?\u201d I asked quietly.\n\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s a price for my assistance,\u201d He said thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s like *Who Wants To Be A Millionaire*. You\u2019d be using a lifeline. I\u2019d have to\u2026 creatively\u2026 write the correct letter on the whiteboard for you. You lose if\u2026 well, we\u2019ll get to that.\u201d\n\nBrandon gestured to a whiteboard stand to the side of my three loved ones. I couldn\u2019t see a marker pen.\n\n\u201cRight, shall we start with Stephanie?\u201d Brandon asked.\n\n\u201cWait\u2026\u201d I whispered.\n\n\u201cThe word is *Pulchritudinous*.\u201d\n\nI inhaled deeply, preparing to best Brandon at his demented idea of a prank, but I had no idea as to how deep his insanity ran. I was about to find out.\n\n\u201cP\u2026 U\u2026 L\u2026 C\u2026 H\u2026 R\u2026 I\u2026 D\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2013 T, not D,\u201d Brandon said.\n\nThen something horrifying happened. Brandon produced a pair of hedge trimmers from a small duffel bag on the floor and took long strides towards Stephanie. He clipped, clipped, clipped, clipped, and clipped.\n\nShe wailed as five fingers were severed, one by one, from her left hand. I screamed, as did Amy and Tom. A fountain of blood gushed from the stubs on Stephanie\u2019s hand, and Brandon sinisterly shaped each of the five fingers into various formations.\n\nHe was spelling the word with her body parts. Sellotaping P, U, L, C, and H to the whiteboard, much to my horror.\n\n\u201cNeed more,\u201d Brandon hissed, a deranged glint in his eyes.\n\nStephanie was too weakened by blood loss to resist Brandon as he clipped away at her right hand, severing those fingers and moulding them into letters too. Our cries of horror must\u2019ve carried a good mile, but Brandon\u2019s family lived on an isolated plot of land.\n\n\u201cThere we go. R, I, and T. T, James, not D. *Pulchritudinous*. Go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cP\u2026 U\u2026 L\u2026 C\u2026 H\u2026 R\u2026 I\u2026 T\u2026 U\u2026 D\u2026 I\u2026 N\u2026 O\u2026 U\u2026 S.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, James. Just wow. Second try? You really are a genius. And I\u2019m a man of my word!\u201d\n\nBrandon pressed a smaller button beneath the big red one on the remote, and Stephanie\u2019s chains loosened. Bawling, she fell to her knees and began to crawl across the attic floor, holding her stumped, fingerless, bloodied hands before her. But it was already too late \u2013 she didn\u2019t even make it to the attic door before crumpling lifelessly and staring at me with unblinking eyes.\n\n\u201cMost unfortunate. Anyway, moving on to Amy. The word is *Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis*,\u201d Brandon said.\n\nStill unwilling to grapple with the terror of Stephanie\u2019s death, I found myself collapsing to my knees and spelling Amy\u2019s word before my brain had even caught up \u2013 I was in shock.\n\n\u201cP\u2026 N\u2026 E\u2026 U\u2026 M\u2026 O\u2026 N\u2026 O\u2026 U\u2026 L\u2026 T\u2026 R\u2026 A\u2026 M\u2026 I\u2026 C\u2026 R\u2026 O\u2026 L\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2013 L? What?\u201d Brandon sighed. \u201cThe correct letter, after O, is S. This is going to be a long one, James\u2026\u201d\n\nI could only observe from my knelt position on the floor as Brandon spelled out the eighteen letters I\u2019d done correctly, plus the nineteenth that he revealed. Nineteen body parts. You can\u2019t imagine my horror as I watched Brandon inflict the same terror upon Amy that he inflicted upon Stephanie. And when he had ten fingers on his whiteboard, what did he use next?\n\nNot toes, as one might have hoped, to give Amy a fighting chance at surviving. No. He clipped her arms. I screeched at the top of my lungs, eyes swimming with terrified tears as Amy\u2019s head swiftly lolled forwards, blood gushing from the open wounds on her torso. And yet Brandon continued to hack up her dismembered body parts, contorting them into each letter of the word and sellotaping them to the whiteboard.\n\n\u201cP\u2026 N\u2026 E\u2026 U\u2026 M\u2026 O\u2026 N\u2026 O\u2026 U\u2026 L\u2026 T\u2026 R\u2026 A\u2026 M\u2026 I\u2026 C\u2026 R\u2026 O\u2026 S... Well, I would say to continue, James, but\u2026 it appears you\u2019ve failed. I don\u2019t think poor Amy is moving, is she? That\u2019s how you lose, James,\u201d Brandon faux-sniffled, walking over to her limp corpse and puppeteering her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re oh-so-smart, James. Why couldn\u2019t you spell the word properly?\u201d\n\nI wailed inconsolably, horrified by the unfathomably and graphically gruesome spectacle before me. As I collapsed into a ball on the ground, my tormentor continued.\n\n\u201cNow, according to the Oxford Dictionary, *pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis* is the longest word in the English language,\u201d Brandon said, unfazed by my hyperventilation. \u201cBut did you know that there exists another word \u2013 a far longer word?\u201d\n\nI sobbed, unable to breathe properly \u2013 nostrils clogged with snot bubbles, and cheeks strewn with tears.\n\n\u201cThe Titin protein is the largest protein in the human body, which is why its full name is such an obscenely long word. 189,819 letters, to be exact. So, that brings us to Tom. And the third word is...\u201d\n\nI would include it here, but it\u2019s [far too long for a Reddit post](https://thewildlife.blog/2021/12/07/full-titin-protein-name-is-189819-letter-longest-english-word/).\n\nYou can imagine how many times I failed to spell a 189,819-letter-long word correctly. And though I\u2019d accepted that I couldn\u2019t save my baby brother, I hadn\u2019t expected Brandon to make Tom\u2019s end so horribly drawn-out.\n\nThe monster plucked minuscule strips of flesh from my little brother\u2019s body to form the letters of the 189,819-letter word. I kept trying to spell it, watching as Tom bled out hauntingly slowly. He sobbed for the first hour or so, before uttering little more than the occasional hoarse grunt or inaudible whisper. Letter-shaped wounds formed where my brother\u2019s skin had been, and Brandon continued to spell the word along the floor after he\u2019d run out of room on the whiteboard.\n\nIt took hours for my brother to finally fall still, but Brandon didn\u2019t stop, even after Tom\u2019s death \u2013 after I lost. He made me finish the word.\n\nWe used up every last piece of my brother\u2019s body to spell out the full word \u2013 limbs, eyes, innards, and bones. I don\u2019t know why I kept spelling. There was nothing that Brandon held over me. My only explanation is that sheer shock drove me onwards. Horror at what I\u2019d witnessed. A disconnect from reality.\n\nWhen the word was finished, Brandon silently left the attic.\n\nI eventually returned to the real world, in a sense, and called the police. It\u2019s hard to explain what followed. I know that Brandon\u2019s parents were found in their bed, throats slit. Their cars were in the garage.\n\nThe demented boy has been missing for eighteen years, and my town has never been the same. I\u2019ve never been the same. As I type this post now, I don\u2019t see letters. Not really.\n\nI see body parts.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

Spelling it out loud just once would take like 2 days. Throw in the repeated attempts, the  torture and dismemberment; I don't know, 4-5 days nonstop at least. Missing kids last seen with a known little creep? I'm sorry no one came sooner and spared you at least some of that trauma.",

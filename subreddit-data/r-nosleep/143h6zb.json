    "postText": "**PART 2:**\n\nI got another sticky note\u2026. It was on the driver\u2019s side window of my car this time. I\u2019d just clocked out to go on my lunch break, and now eating was the last thing on my mind. If anything, I wanted to retch up all of the contents of this morning\u2019s breakfast. This time instead of the usual yellow sticky note, it was blue.\r  \n\r  \n***\u201cYou look lovely in blue.\u201d***\r  \n\r  \nMy hands shook as I clenched the note between trembling fingers. I was wearing a cornflower blue dress today. Balling the little paper in my fist, I threw it on the ground and stomped on it with my heel. I was tired of looking over my shoulder. I was tired of being anxious. I was tired of being on edge all the time. There had to be a way to figure out who was doing this. Getting these sticky notes was almost like Chinese water torture - small and insignificant, but mentally taxing over time. Each sticky note I received was slowly eating away at my sanity, and if I didn't get a grip, I was afraid I was going to lose my mind. Just to be safe, I hastily scanned my surroundings before doing the same with the inside of my car. Once the coast was clear, I unlocked the door and settled into my seat. I\u2019ve actually been compiling a list of things I think might help me uncover this \u201csticky note stalker\u201d.\r  \n\r  \n*1.) I was convinced that it was a \u201che\u201d. Maybe\u2026? The handwriting was nothing elegant. No loops, or swirls or curly q\u2019s. Quite the opposite really. The writing was always in black pen and always written in all caps. And it was always pretty thick? Maybe like he wrote with a heavy hand? And the pen itself might have been a felt tip? It didn\u2019t look anything like how a ballpoint pen might write, gliding across the paper in smooth thin lines.*\n\n\r  \n*2.) I\u2019ve received a total of 12 sticky notes and they have always been yellow\u2026 Except for today?*\r  \n\n\n*3.) The majority of them have been posted on my refrigerator.*\n\n\r  \n*4.) He knows where I live\u2026 And where I work.*\n\n*5.) He\u2019s smart enough to be sporadic when it comes to the day and time he leaves them, but up until today, he had enough of a pattern that I could follow where he would put them at least. They were either stuck to my refrigerator or my bathroom mirror. Now\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure what to think? This is the first time I\u2019ve received one from outside of my apartment.*\r  \n\r  \nLooking at the crumpled piece of blue laying on the ground just outside my car, something inside of me urged me to look at it just one more time. Cracking open my car door, I reached out and snatched it up. Closing the door, I locked it and then unrolled the paper. My eyes scanned over it again. This time, I noticed something strange. On the corner of the sticky note was a weird little arrow shaped marking? My finger traced the marking searching for an answer. When I pulled my fingertip away from the paper though, black ink followed. This was fresh\u2026 Not enough to smear when I crumpled the paper, but enough that when I pressed my fingertips to the lines, it spread across the pad of my finger. A mixture of fear and paranoia gripped me and refused to let go. My eyes darted around the parking garage again. Was he in one of the other cars watching me? Had he already fled? My mind was a train flying off the rails and it was almost too hard to keep up. More importantly though, what was that marking on the corner of this sticky note\u2026 And did the others bear the same marks?\r  \n\r  \nShoving the sticky note into my purse, I drove back home and locked the door behind me. My chest heaved as I fought to catch my breath. I know for sure that I raced past two tenants having a conversation on the stairs, and I\u2019m sure they thought I looked positively mad running across the parking lot like my clothes were on fire. What his intentions were exactly, I had no clue, but I did know that none of his notes had been\u2026 Threatening yet? If anything, they were just unsettling. Kicking off my heels, I ran into my room and yanked open my bedside drawer. Pilfering through the various sticky notes, I pulled them all out and laid them on my bed. None of them shared any kind of resemblance to the blue one. I felt like I\u2019d hit a dead end until my eyes zeroed in on something that made my blood run cold. There in the very corner of the sticky note closest to me were some very small dots and\u2026dashes? Not enough to notice when you read them individually, but together\u2026 Hurriedly, my eyes scanned over all of them. Only four contained these strange marks. None of them seemed to match up with the blue sticky note though? Confusion curled around my thoughts. Perhaps he\u2019s been leaving me hints? Little bread crumbs\u2026 Did he want me to find him? Were these markings just ink splatters though? Maybe I was reading too much into it? Or was this whole thing a game to him\u2026 Looking at the markings again, I tried to piece it all together, but I just couldn\u2019t figure it out. What did these four sticky notes have in common with my most recent one? Or were these two different messages all together?\r  \n\r  \nI don\u2019t know if this makes sense to any of you, but I just have this overwhelming feeling that the markings aren\u2019t a coincidence (connected or not). They\u2019ve got to mean something\u2026Right? Here are the dots and dashes I found on the four sticky notes. I\u2019ve written them in the order I received the sticky notes. Maybe some of you can help me make sense of this? I should have taken a picture of all of them before I left to go to work this morning, but maybe I can attach those pictures to my next post. Perhaps I should just play him at his own game\u2026 Leave him a sticky note of his own?\r  \n\r  \n1.) .--. \r  \n2.) ..- \r  \n3.) .-. \r  \n4.) .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you missed PART 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/142g5t2/i\\_think\\_ive\\_got\\_a\\_stalker\\_and\\_he\\_sends\\_me\\_sticky/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3",

    "postText": "\u201cMom?\u201d I asked, \u201cwhy are you closing the blinds?\u201d\r  \n\u201cOur neighborhood has a Peeping Tom,\u201d she responded, peering with a single eye into the gloom of suburbia in winter. I didn\u2019t know exactly what my mother was looking for, but I knew she was nervous\u2013and that made me nervous. I was eight years old that Christmas, and the words \u201cPeeping Tom\u201d meant nothing to me. \r  \nI knew that \u201cpeepers\u201d was another word for eye, and I couldn\u2019t help but imagine the mad, rolling eyeballs and black hat of Judge Doom in \u201cWho Framed Roger Rabbit?\u201d  It had been over a month since I\u2019d seen that movie, but it still gave me nightmares. \r  \nIn my mind, the sinister, crazy-faced, glassy-eyed Peeping Tom was a monster that crept through our neighborhood with huge cartoonish strides, pressing his rubbery white face against our windows at night. Unable to sleep, I lay watching the shadows of the trees on my bedroom wall, trying to convince myself that they weren\u2019t Peeping Tom\u2019s too-long fingers. \r  \nThe next morning, however, I had to face something even more frightening (to my eight-year-old mind) than Peeping Tom: my mother insisted on walking me to the bus stop.\r  \n\"Just to be safe\" she said, but she wouldn\u2019t have to endure the sneers and laughter of classmates for the rest of the year. It started as soon as I got on the bus: a loud chant from the back of \u201cMomma\u2019s Boy! Momma\u2019s Boy!\u201d that felt like it would never end. Trying to ignore them, I looked out the window\u2026 and what I saw chilled my blood. \r  \nMy mother was walking home alone\u2026and a figure in the bushes was watching her. \r  \nA figure in a broad-billed black hat and battered black trenchcoat.\r  \nFrom the fast-moving school bus window I couldn\u2019t see its crazy round eyes, but I knew that they were there all the same.\r  \n\u201cWait!\u201d I screamed. \u201cStop the bus!\u201d Laughter. The chants of \u201cMomma\u2019s Boy\u201d grew louder. The driver ignored me. At school, I couldn\u2019t focus on anything. \r  \nWhat if the Peeping Tom had crept up on my mother with those impossibly long, silent steps?\r  \nWhat if it had wrapped a filthy, black-gloved hand around her mouth and dragged her away?\r  \nWhat if\u2013\r  \nI breathed a sigh of relief when I saw my mother waiting expectantly at the bus stop that afternoon. Instead of trying to wriggle away, I grabbed her hand and squeezed it tight.\r  \nThere were worse things than my classmate\u2019s teasing out there, I realized. Things that hid in the bushes and crept through the dark. Things like a Peeping Tom. \r  \nThat evening, I muted my video game to listen to my mother\u2019s conversation with one of her friends on our street, Evelyn. \r  \nApparently, Evelyn had come out of the shower to find a man in a black hat and trenchcoat rummaging through her drawers. Why anyone would want to try to steal dumb girl\u2019s clothes was beyond me, but Evelyn sure seemed to be plenty scared about it. Although if the Peeping Tom was anything like what I imagined\u2026I would have been, too. \r  \nMy mother invited Evelyn to stay the night with us; I breathed a sigh of relief when she refused. Evelyn smelled like cloves and was always asking me questions when I just wanted to play. The police were parked outside her house, Evelyn told my mother, and besides\u2013Claire would be home soon. Claire was the woman who lived with Evelyn, although I wasn\u2019t exactly sure how they knew each other. My mother did my best to reassure our neighbor before she hung up.\r  \n\u201cAt least there hasn\u2019t been any more violence,\u201d she said in a low voice. I couldn\u2019t hear Evelyn\u2019s response; it sounded like she was shushing my mother, hurrying to get off the line. \r  \nMy mother\u2019s words were far from comforting. How did she know that this Peeping Tom hadn\u2019t hid a bunch of dead bodies in the woods by the park? Maybe following people and breaking into their houses was just the beginning. Maybe the Peeping Tom was just getting warmed up! And why had she said \u2018any MORE violence?\u2019 Had this sort of thing happened before? Was it just something normal adults had to deal with? At eight years old, I had no idea. \r  \nI closed my curtains that night\u2013\r  \n\"Just to be safe,\" as my mother had said.\r  \nBut that didn't make it any easier to sleep.\r  \nEspecially once I heard that fleshy, squelching noise against the glass. \r  \nIt sounded an awful lot like a tongue.\r  \nI sat up in bed\u2013and whatever was out there began to scrape long fingernails on the glass. \r  \n\"Mom?\"  I whispered.\r  \nThe noises grew louder, frantic and hungry. Any minute now, it would break through\u2013\r  \n\"MOM!\" I screamed. As my mother rustled out of bed, running footsteps crossed the roof outside my window, then disappeared. My mother saw me pointing at the curtains and yanked them back, baseball bat at the ready\u2013\r  \nBut there was nothing outside but darkness. \r  \n\"Peeping\u2026Tom\u2026\" I panted. My mother stuck her head out, looked for evidence, frowned.\r  \n\"Honey\u2026are you sure you didn't just have a bad dream?\"\r  \nI shook my head. Couldn't she see the spit-streak on the glass?! \r  \n\"Well, I'll call it in\u2026but I don't want you to worry. The police are out looking for the bad guy, and they're going to catch him.\"\r  \nI thought about how rapidly those footsteps crossed the roof; I doubted the police could move that fast. I slept in my mother's room that night, and although she constantly reassured me that \"it was just a dream,\" I noticed she lay the bat within her reach by the nightstand.\r  \nThe next night, Claire showed up crying on our porch just before midnight. Everyone introduced her as Evelyn\u2019s \u2018friend,\u2019 but even at eight years old, I knew that there was a lot more to it than that. It was in how Claire touched Evelyn's back when they came over for my mother's parties, how they laughed and finished each others' sentences\u2013\r  \nAnd that was the problem. \r  \nEavesdropping from the top of the stairs, I picked up the drift right away: Evelyn had disappeared. And while Claire was sure that the neighborhood Peeping Tom was responsible, the police had fixated on Evelyn's 'deviant lifestyle\u2013'\r  \nAnd that meant Claire.\r  \nIn those days, certain types of relationships just weren't talked about or tolerated by most people, and anyone who participated in them was suspicious by default. Of course, I didn't understand any of that back then\u2013but I did focus on one detail that Claire confessed to my mother. The police cruiser parked outside Evelyn and Claire's home had left its position when a sighting of the Peeping Tom had been called in\u2013my sighting. My guts knotted up: I was partly responsible for Evelyn's disappearance! The Peeping Tom might have planned it all along: scaring me, distracting the police patrol, then breaking in to take Evelyn\u2026.\r  \nBack in my room, I gripped my pocket knife until my knuckles turned white, swearing (like I'd seen in movies) that I'd give that damn Peeping Tom what he had coming to him\u2013\r  \nBut it was not to be.\r  \nAfter Evelyn's disappearance, the sightings of the \"Peeping Tom\" came to an end. The intimidating, shark-like police cruisers that had patrolled our neighborhood were gone, leaving behind only the empty windows of the home that Claire and Evelyn had shared. They stared at me accusingly whenever I walked by.\r  \nWhile Claire was ultimately found Not Guilty of Evelyn's murder, the experience left a rotten taste in her mouth, and no one was surprised when she left without a forwarding address. \r  \nI didn\u2019t think about her again until a few years later, when my friends and I were trying our first cigarette in a ramshackle shed we'd found in the woods behind the park. My first lungful made me cough and lurch forward; my foot went straight through the rotten floor. \r  \nThere was a ladder underneath. It led down into a bare concrete basement that had probably been sealed off for years\u2013 \r  \nBut the scent down there was familiar:\r  \nEvelyn's clove perfume.\r  \nI shuddered, made up a lame excuse, and hurried home. I felt the need to tell an adult what I\u2019d found, but by the time I reached my front door, I was having second thoughts. If I told anyone about the shed, I\u2019d have to explain what we were doing there\u2026I didn\u2019t want to get my friends in trouble. I could still smell that nasty cigarette smoke on my clothes\u2026what if the adults could smell it too? Besides, I didn\u2019t have any real evidence\u2013just a familiar scent. \r  \nI decided to hide my clothes at the bottom of the laundry pile, take a shower, and keep my mouth shut. My family moved away a few months later, and I forgot all about the  \u201cPeeping Tom\u201d and my discovery in the shed\u2026until last night, something happened that jogged my memory.\r  \nI went to bed early and woke to my wife shaking me and whispering in my ear:\r  \n\u201cHoney? I think there\u2019s a guy in the bushes beside our house\u2026\u201d\r  \n\rI sprung out of bed and grabbed the baseball bat I kept beside the nightstand. The grip felt cold in my hand as I ran to the patio door. I flicked on the outside light and jumped outside:\r  \n\u201cHEY!\u201d I shouted, hoping that I sounded more intimidating than I felt, \u201cWHO\u2019S THERE?!\u201d\r  \nThere was no response\u2026but I could feel eyes on me. I couldn\u2019t help but imagine the eyes from my childhood nightmares: huge, bloodshot, and insane. \r  \nThe eyes of the Peeping Tom. \r  \nA cold sweat broke out on my forehead as I jostled the first bush with the bat, hoping\u2013no, praying\u2013that I wouldn\u2019t see some awful thing draped in a nasty trenchcoat and broad-brimmed black hat staring back at me from the other side of the leaves. My wife, Kim, stood in the kitchen, one hand on a butcher knife, the other on her phone, ready to call the police. \r  \nAs I approached the third, I heard Kim scream. Nothing was hiding in the branches, but I turned around in time to see a long shadow scurry across our backyard and disappear into the trees beside the power lines\u2013 \r  \nThe figure that cast it wore a filthy trenchcoat and a familiar black hat. \r  \nWe called the authorities immediately. They told us that no one nearby had reported being a stalker, but that they\u2019d increase patrols in the area. There wasn\u2019t much more that they could do\u2026and I resolved to take matters into my own hands. What disturbed me the most was that the \u201cPeeping Tom\u201d I\u2019d seen had looked identical to the one from my childhood nightmares. It shouldn\u2019t have been possible, and yet\u2026\r  \nSpurred on by my disquieting memories, I did something I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d never do: I started searching for my childhood neighbors on social media. Kim was snoring softly in the bedroom beside my office; the doors were locked and I had my trusty bat beside my desk, but none of it made me feel any more secure in light of the new information I uncovered.\r  \nIt seemed that almost all of my childhood friends had ordinary lives: some heartbreaks, some joy, a sprinkling of drama. The occasional run-in with police, drug addiction, or wildly successful career. For almost all of them, the stories were nearly the same\u2026\r  \nBut for the families who\u2019d lived on Maidsway Court\u2013my street back then\u2013it was a different story. \r  \nEvelyn wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d vanished. Over the past twenty years, there had been five disappearances, three unexplained deaths, and two suicides. \r  \nSomething horrible was happening to my childhood neighbors.\r  \nDread settled into my gut like a cold stone when I recalled their houses, their faces, their quirks, the junk they had in their yards. The moment I looked at a street view map of my old street, the horrifying pattern became obvious.\r  \nThe bad luck haunting my childhood neighbors moved from left to right, beginning at Evelyn\u2019s house. Even though almost everyone on my street had moved away in the years following Evelyn\u2019s disappearance (another odd coincidence), the pattern remained the same. \r  \nSomeone or something was destroying our lives one by one\u2026and my family was next.\r  \nI called my mother right away, but she didn\u2019t pick up. That was disquieting enough in itself: my mother always left her phone at full volume, day or night, and always kept it by her side. \r  \nI shook Kim awake, bundled her into a coat, and brought her down to the car. I knew that my incoherent explanation of where we were going and what we were doing had scared her\u2026but if I was right, she wasn\u2019t nearly as scared as she should have been. \r  \nI drove in white-knuckled silence, pulling into my mother\u2019s driveway after completing the two hour drive in less than an hour twenty. Every light in the house was on\u2026and the curtains of the open living room window were blowing in the breeze. I rushed inside, bat in hand. Kim and I searched my mother\u2019s house again and again, but there was no sign of her. \r  \nMy mother\u2019s bed was a mess, and I could already imagine how it might\u2019ve gone: the man in black could\u2019ve slipped in through the window, tiptoed upstairs, pressed a chloroform cloth over her mouth, and dragged her out the backdoor\u2026into the woods.\r  \nMy mother\u2019s address book lay on her nightstand. I flipped it open and struck gold: she\u2019d kept in touch with people from Maidsway Court: I had at least five phone numbers to try.\r  \nWhile Kim busied herself with shutting the living room window and checking the other locks, I called my ex-neighbors\u2019 phone numbers in the order that they were written:. \r  \n\u201cH-hello?\u201d a gruff man answered on the fourth ring. \r  \n\u201cDave? This is Bryce Leeds. You lived on Maidsway Court in the 90\u2019s, right?\u201d\r  \n\u201c...Bryce? That skinny kid from the end of the road\u2026? Look, Bryce, do you have any idea what fuckin\u2019 time it is? I gotta work tomorrow\u2026\u201d\r  \n\u201cI know and I\u2019m sorry but my mother is missing!\u201d I pleaded. \u201cI NEED to know what you know!\u201d\r  \nClick.\r  \nThe next number wasn\u2019t one I would\u2019ve called if I\u2019d had a choice: Claire. Even though I was only a child at the time, I still felt some guilt over how everyone had treated her. She picked up right away:\r  \n\u201cThis is Bryce Leeds.\u201d I said immediately. \u201cMy mother is missing and\u2013\r  \n\u201cSo it\u2019s true.\u201d Claire gasped. \u201cThere really is no escape\u2026\u201d\r  \n\u201cNo escape from what?\u201d \r  \n\u201cWhat everyone on Maidsway Court did when you were just a toddler.\u201d \r  \n\u201cWhat are you TALKING about?! Look, my mother\u2013\u201d\r  \n\u201cListen!\u201d Claire shouted. I sat on the unmade bed and did as I was told. \u201cBack then, there was a hobo who lived in a shack in the woods by the name of Tom Caulforth. Tom was\u2026how can I put it\u2026a dirty old man. He said filthy things to every woman and girl he saw\u2013sometimes he even followed us home. He got off on our fear, I think, and he took to spying on the women of Maidsway Court every night. He\u2019d creep right up to our windows, and even snuck into our homes and left traces of his presence, just to make us feel unsafe. The police would haul him off, but with no physical evidence they could never hold him for long. One day, he approached Evelyn while she was working alone in the garden, spewing his usual filth. He got so close that she could smell his foul breath on her face, and when he tried to touch her\u2026\u201d Claire paused. \u201cYou have to understand how afraid we were back then. Everyone was at a boiling point, we just wanted him, that man we called \u2018Dirty Tom\u2019  out of our lives\u2026that\u2019s why Evelyn hit him in the head with a shovel. He went down hard, bleeding, and swore he\u2019d sue her and take everything we had\u2026so she hit him again. And again. Dave across the street and your mother heard the screams and came running; eventually, everyone else did too. No one felt shock or horror at what Evelyn had done. We felt relief. Dirty Tom Caulforth was finally out of our lives\u2026and nobody would miss him. We buried him in the woods beside his shed\u2026and never told a soul.\"\r  \n\"That's horrible, but what does it have to do with my mother going missing?\"\r  \n\"Don't you get it? Dirty Tom isn't resting peacefully. He's getting his revenge, hurting our families one by one\u2013\"\r  \nThe front door opened downstairs. Where was Kim?! I sprung to my feet, grabbed my bat, and ran to the hallway. \r  \nMy mother was coming in the door; she jumped when she saw me.\r  \n\"Bryce! What're you doing here? I just got a call from the hospital saying you were in the ER, but when I drove there\u2026\"\r  \n\u201cDid you see Kim on your way in?\u201d I grabbed my mother\u2019s shoulders.\r  \n\u201cNo, should I have?\u201d she sounded puzzled. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d \r  \n\u201cGet in the car. I\u2019m going to pay a visit to Tom Caulforth.\u201d My mother\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cI talked to Claire, mom. I know everything, and I understand\u2026but we have got to finish this. Whatever Tom Caulforth became\u2026I think it's got Kim.\u201d \r  \nThe sky was brightening when we pulled into the empty parking lot of my childhood park two hours later, but the thick fog made everything gray. The streetlights looked monstrous\u2026and the forest looked hungry. We couldn\u2019t see more than five feet away; every sound in the forest made us jump. I held my mother\u2019s hand as we walked uncertainly toward the shed where I\u2019d smoked my first cigarette\u2013unaware that a human monster who\u2019d filled our neighborhood with fear was buried just a stone\u2019s throw away. My mother\u2019s hand shook as she pointed to a weedy patch of dirt behind the shed.\r  \nI jammed the shovel I\u2019d taken from her garage into the dirt and started digging. I barely felt the blisters forming on my hands; my head was too full of images of my wife being dragged through the woods at inhuman speeds\u2026and the horrific, very real possibility that a dead pervert\u2019s mindless revenge might have stolen her away forever. \r  \nThe blade of my shovel hit something that wasn\u2019t dirt. \r  \n\u201cW-we buried him in an old suitcase. Dave said it would help keep animals away from the c-c-corpse\u2026\u201d my mother stammered.  The black plastic was worn, but intact. As I shifted away more dirt, I saw that even the zipper was still closed\u2026almost. Would a bony hand shoot out to grab my wrist if I tried to open the gruesome container? I hesitated\u2026then thought about Kim. I handed my mother my car keys.\r  \n\u201cIf anything happens to me\u2026\u201d I murmured. \u201cRun and don\u2019t look back.\u201d My mother shook her head, tears streaming down her face\u2013\r  \nSomething moved in the foggy woods and we both jumped. It might have been an owl or a deer, but the message was clear: I had to hurry. To my surprise, the zipper still worked. The mist swirled around my mother and I like a living thing as I threw open the battered suitcase.\r  \nKim\u2019s terrified eyes stared up at me. \r  \nShe had been forcibly bent and twisted to fit into the tiny compartment\u2026and her limbs were locked in place by the hands and feet of a rotting corpse.\r  \nA corpse wearing the remains of a broad-brimmed black hat and a dirty trenchcoat\u2013\r  \nThe corpse of Dirty Tom Caulforth. \r  \nWith a cry I jumped into the hole and pried the rigor-mortis-locked fingers off my wife\u2019s wrists; I grabbed her beneath her armpits and dragged her away from the eyeless skull grinning up at us. By night, Dirty Tom\u2019s vengeful spirit was a powerful and murderous force\u2026but by day, he was just rotting bones in a suitcase. I held Kim; she wasn\u2019t ready to speak, but I knew she would when the time was right. \r  \nMy mother lifted up the other \u2018tools\u2019 I had brought from my mother\u2019s garage: charcoal and a gas can. She poured them over the suitcase, said a prayer, and dropped a match.\r  \nWe stood in a circle and watched the past burn\u2013\r  \nHoping that it would forgive us.\r  \nHoping that maybe, this time, it wouldn\u2019t come back to haunt us. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/beardify)",

I've worked with people with challenging behaviours and mental health issues for years, so I can't see it any other way. It doesn't seem like he's got his shit together, so I assume he's not well and he's been let down. Obviously we'll never know, but I'm surprised so many people think him being beaten to death is the best outcome for him.",

How Dirty Tom managed to bury both of them alive while he was still inside of that suitcase is a mystery - it points to someone (or some*thing*) else possibly being involved.

And the hidden basement of the shed next to where Tom's remains were confirmed to be found smelled like the perfume of the woman who killed him? A woman who went missing after murdering him for vague reasons hastily explained as being basically fear and mass hysteria?\n\nI wonder what Kim will have to say. Let's hope she gets a chance to say it. \n\nWho knows, maybe the fear can finally be put to rest. And the *actual* creep can get some help before anyone else gets hurt by her weird grudge or her irrational fears.",

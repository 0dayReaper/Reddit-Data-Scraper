    "postText": "I was lying alone in my room when I heard the voice, deep and crackly, coming from beneath my bed.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d the voice called out.\n\nI told myself I was just imagining it. \n\n\u201cHey kid,\u201d the voice repeated.\n\nI drew my knees up to my chest and ducked my head under the blanket, trying to shut out the voice and the cold wind that drifted in through the window, ruffling the curtains.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the monster underneath your bed,\u201d the voice replied.\n\n\u201cYou mean you\u2019re real?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d the monster said. \u201cOf course I\u2019m real.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have a name?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cOf course I have a name.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh... well what is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrank.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrank?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the monster said. \u201cIs there something wrong with that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I mean, I don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not very monster-ly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell my parents didn\u2019t want me to be a monster.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? What did they want you to be?\u201d\n\n\u201cA dentist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d I said. I could feel myself beginning to smile.\n\n\u201cWhat do your parents want you to be?\u201d it asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.... Hey Frank?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna... like... scare me or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Why would I do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re a monster, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yeah, of course I am, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I scare little kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I thought that was your job.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is my job to scare people,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut only bad people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I a bad person?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you\u2019re not the one I\u2019m here to scare.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are you here to scare?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThe man inside your closet.\u201d \n\nThe skin on my arms goosefleshed up. I wanted to ask him what he meant, but I fell silent as I heard a rustling coming from the closet. The door creaked open, and I could hear soft footsteps padding towards me across the bedroom floor. I didn\u2019t dare peek out of the blanket. The footsteps stopped, and I could hear heavy breathing next to me. I squeezed my eyes tight.\n\nThe warm sanctuary of the blanket disappeared as it was yanked off me.\n\nI hugged my arms around my knees and prepared for the worst. A scream shattered the night air, followed by the sound of breaking glass. I opened my eyes a crack to see a knife lying on the carpet next to my bed, blade glinting in the moonlight.\n\nMy parents rushed into the room and asked me what had happened, but I didn\u2019t know what to say, only that someone had been hiding in my closet and they\u2019d jumped out the window. \n\nMy parents called 911, and the police came right away. They picked up a man called Gary Thompson sprinting through the streets a couple blocks away. He was covered in blood and broken glass. They found Gary\u2019s car abandoned on our property, and inside they found duct tape, knives, barbiturates and a video camera. \n\nFrom what I heard Gary\u2019s lawyer employed an insanity defense, and Gary is currently incarcerated in a state mental facility for the criminally insane. \n\nI never heard from Frank the monster again, but the officer who arrested Gary told me that he sleeps on the floor of the facility.\n\nHe tells the doctors that he\u2019s terrified of Frank, the monster under his bed.\n\n[x](http://davidmaloneystories.com)",

The girl is playing hide and seek and hiding under her bed when the hole appears and she falls in, and there's various other kids down there, and the hole is slowly digesting them.  After the other kids get fully digested, the girl decides she's going to climb out, but as soon as she gets to the top and reaches out, she grabs the hand of the kid sleeping in his bed and he screams and drops her back into the hole",

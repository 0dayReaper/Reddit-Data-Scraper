    "postText": "Twenty-nine days out of thirty, you\u2019d think my daughter Nadine had never had the virus at all. \n\nShe\u2019s a happy girl, and smart, already reading her way through stack after stack of YA books even though she\u2019s only in third grade. She\u2019s not a bad soccer player either. She\u2019s a wing, and I\u2019ve seen her set up some beautiful goals this year. It\u2019s actually fun to watch now that the kids aren\u2019t all clumping around the ball anymore.\n\nBut one day a month, she\u2019s not my daughter anymore. On that day, she has to be fed.\n\nMy wife and I were lucky to have the resources to build her a custom lockroom for the 30th day. It\u2019s got metal walls and a drain, so it\u2019s easy to hose down. \n\nBefore dark on the 30th day, we put her in there with something to eat. At first, a bloody steak was totally sufficient. After a while though, it had to be something fresher, something living. Rats and mice worked for a while, but these days it has to be something bigger. A baby goat works best if we can get one.\n\nOf course, we knew what she really wanted. I\u2019ve seen the way she eyes me hungrily through the small bit of bulletproof glass we installed on the room\u2019s door. \n\nLast month, the goat wasn\u2019t enough. I could tell she was hungry, because she was pacing like mad, her steps rattling the house. Toward dawn, we heard an angry pounding like thunder, and in the morning, we woke to find massive dents in the walls, the steel bent thanks to the strength of her blows.\n\nIn the country of \\[redacted\\] where she first got attacked, the people simply kill anyone with the bite. They don\u2019t even wait for the first full moon. It\u2019s cruel, of course. But then, they don\u2019t have the resources to take care of their children like we do. They don\u2019t tell outsiders about the virus until it\u2019s too late. You wouldn\u2019t believe how much we had to pay to get her back to the U.S. alive.\n\nThe day after her change, Nadine is usually exhausted but thankful. We let her watch a few extra cartoons and eat whatever she likes. Any other time, she\u2019d be begging for gummi bears and ice cream, but the day after a change, it\u2019s nothing but protein: eggs and bacon for breakfast, a full packet of deli turkey for lunch, two steaks for dinner. She just inhales the stuff, barely tasting it. Then, by the next day, she\u2019s pretty much back to normal, back to school and playing with her friends. \n\nYesterday morning, as she left for school, my wife turned to me, tears in her eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to kill her,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to. I\u2019ve been looking up ways to do it. She wouldn\u2019t feel any pain, and we could make it look like an accident.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just having a hard day,\u201d I told her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We can reinforce the steel with concrete. I\u2019ve got a quote out to a guy right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll last for a month. Maybe two. And then what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\n\nThat afternoon, the quote for the reinforced concrete came in. It was even higher than I\u2019d expected, but it was a rush job after all. We only had a few more days before gametime. I told the guys to come right away.\n\nAnd if I\u2019m going to be honest, I think it would have worked. Nadine has to stop getting stronger at some point, right? It just doesn\u2019t physically seem possible that her muscles on day 30 can keep growing, or that her teeth and nails can get any longer or sharper. There\u2019s got to be a physical limit. \n\nUnfortunately, I may never get to find out.\n\nYou see, for some reason, last night, the change came early. Day 28 instead of day 30. We hadn\u2019t even put Nadine in the room. She was just in her regular bed down the hall. \n\nI barely had time to wake up as I heard her sprinting down the hall. Then the door burst open, splintering into tiny chunks of wood as she stood there staring at us, her black fur shining in the moonlight, her mouth open and displaying so many teeth they it didn\u2019t seem possible she could even close her jaws.\n\nMy wife screamed, and Nadine leapt on her, tearing through her nightgown and opening her from chest to hip with a single swipe of her claws. My wife gurgled a small sound and then went limp as Nadine devoured her.\n\nI backed up to the side of the room, my body shaking with the knowledge that I\u2019d soon be devoured by my own daughter. And if I\u2019m being honest, I was more afraid for her than I was for myself. \n\nBecause for me, it would all be over in a minute. \n\nFor her, she\u2019d wake up in some strange alley a mile away, naked and covered in blood, wondering how she got there. And then if she somehow made it home, she\u2019d see the mess she\u2019d created. And she\u2019d have to live with that forever.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said as Nadine turned to me, my wife\u2019s entrails dripping down her face. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\nBut then, as she looked at me, something odd happened. Something in her eyes. I saw a glimmer there I hadn\u2019t witnessed before. Maybe it was because she was finally full\u2013sated by the kind of meat she\u2019d been wanting all along. Or maybe it was just a part of her evolution. \n\nFor a moment, she *saw* me. And then she ran off into the dark.\n\nIt\u2019s late now, and I don\u2019t know where Nadine is. I\u2019ve heard a few screams in the distance, and I\u2019ve tried to follow them in my car, but by the time I get to them, all I find is a bloody mess. Gored bodies and sirens. But dawn is coming soon. Soon, she\u2019ll be back to the sweet girl she\u2019s always been. She\u2019ll have no idea where she is or how she got there. She\u2019ll be crying for me.\n\nAnd so I\u2019m begging you. If you happen to find a little girl covered in blood in your backyard, in your pool house, in some dark corner of your room. Know that she means you no harm. She only wants to come home to her dad. \n\nI can build a better room, maybe have her sleep in it every night. We can make this right. [We can keep her safe.](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)",

What are you going to explain to the cops when your wife is reported missing?  Oh my, call a lawyer and then call the cops. \n\n\n\nDo you really understand this virus? Is it possible Nadine heard your wife and her decision to kill her?  The same night she mentions this your child's transformation occurs?   Why do you assume it's locked to the moon cycle?  Sounds like she's able to change at any time. \n\n\n\nWhat happens if and when Nadine bites someone who doesn't die? Can she transmit the illness during the rest of the month? \n\n\n\nOP!  the locals knew and understood something that you don't. How did Nadine get bitten if they killed anyone who's been bitten? Someone tried to keep their own child alive until they broke free and bit your daughter. \n\n\n\nI think you've been in shock since then.  Money can't solve this issue.  Do you still have any contact information for the local of redacted? It's time to get more answers as this is clearly out of control.",

If they haven\u2019t killed her and you do find her your only course of action would be to kill her, it would be a mercy considering what she will or likely already has become.",

If you're so attached, kill her and do suicide.  Together.",

All he got was a street full of dancing ghouls!  In reality, you have a dead wife, animalistic daughter and you need silver bullets.  You could say your wife left you (make sure you clean up the mess) with your daughter, but can you live with the climbing death toll?",

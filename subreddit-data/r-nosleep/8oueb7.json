    "postText": "I work in security at Disney World, the happiest place on Earth. Typically, I wouldn\u2019t say where I work as obviously there are some pretty strict rules about things employees can put online, but I just don\u2019t think I can tell this properly without that context. And, honestly, I think this may be it for me anyway with this job. I just can\u2019t see myself working here any longer now. \n\nI\u2019ve been with the company for 23 years. The first 20 years I worked in the parks \u2013 nabbing shoplifters and rounding up people who were drinking too much for the heat. Occasionally there\u2019d be a fight to break up, but people usually kept it pretty mild. \n\nThe heat and walking was getting too much for me the last few years so I asked to be transferred somewhere with a/c and the company moved me to one of their resorts. While the working conditions were 110&amp;#37; better as far as climate and comfort go, the guest issues were trickier \\- mainly domestics. I guess the expensive and stress of vacation got to a lot of people and I\u2019d be called by neighboring rooms because some mom and dad were yelling at each other. I\u2019d try to suggest they take a nap or go do separate activities for a bit and that would usually calm them down.\n\nBut none of that is what I\u2019m here for. I\u2019ve got to get this out while I have time.\n\nThree days ago I got a call from management. Apparently a couple of days before that, housekeeping had went into a room that should\u2019ve been turned over that day (turned over is when one guest leaves by about 11:00 a.m. and the next guest checks in around 3:00 p.m.) and all of the guests\u2019 items were still in the room. Housekeeping made a note of it and moved on, but during the next two days when they entered the room, everything was still there and untouched.\n\nI went to check it out and sure enough there was an empty room full of luggage, clothes, snacks, some toys, everything a family would need for vacation. The manager had already looked up the previous reservation and it was for a family \u2013 dad, mom, two little kids. I tried to call the phone numbers they had given but all I got was voice mail. We were a bit stumped so I made the call that housekeeper could clean the room and take the family\u2019s personal items to be held until we got in contact with someone.\n\nI went digging into the reservation more. The family had arrived five days before housekeeping discovered all of their stuff.  I found that the family had paid a parking fee and their vehicle description was listed. A quick walk of the parking lots and I had easily located their vehicle. So that ruled out a car accident or them deciding to just leave all their stuff behind. \n\nNext, I saw that they had bought a dining plan. This is when a guest prepays for all of their food. They\u2019re given a certain number of \u201ccredits\u201d to use for meals. This family had only used 3 credits and the last one was two days after they checked in. It appeared that the day they arrived, they got here late and probably just stayed on the resort. The next day they used 2 credits at Epcot. The second park day they used just 1 credit at Magic Kingdom and it was at breakfast time. \n\nNow at Disney we have something called Magic Bands. Magic Bands are worn by the guests and act as a room key, park ticket, credit card, dining reservation payment, fastpass (a system used to bypass lines), and more. It took some work, but I was finally able to look up this family\u2019s fastpass history. The day they went to Magic Kingdom, they had breakfast at a restaurant in the park, rode a couple of rides, and then rode their last ride, It\u2019s a Small World around 11:00 a.m. Then nothing.\n\nFinally, it was time to bring in someone else on this. I called an old co\\-worker at Magic Kingdom and asked him to pull security footage for It\u2019s a Small World at the time they rode it and I made my way over there. When I got there, my friend was very confused, almost distraught, looking. He showed me what he found. There\u2019s usually a camera in the direction of where rides load and unload. The footage showed them scanning their bands to use fastpasses for the ride and boarding the ride. The footage from the exit of the ride just showed the other people in their car exiting. They weren\u2019t there.\n\nOf course we thought the worse, maybe one of the kids had fallen out and mom and dad and the other kid got off in the middle of the ride to help and they all got injured or killed or stuck in machinery somewhere. So we shut down the ride. Middle of the damn day. Turned off that ear worm music and turned up the lights. Me and my buddy walked that ride three times before we called in help. Eventually there was close to ten cast members searching, and we didn\u2019t find shit except for three cell phones and a hat.\n\nI was right stumped. I've kept digging the past couple of days, and I\u2019m not sure who to tell what I found next to. I\u2019ve called the police and I suppose they\u2019re on the way, but the company has a way of covering up things like this and I decided I can\u2019t live with myself if I don\u2019t put out some type of warning.\n\nI kept digging into their reservation over the last couple of days and today I noticed they had purchased memory maker. There are photographers all over the parks and cameras in a lot of the rides and, with memory maker, the photos are all free. They automatically get added to a guest\u2019s Disney account when the system knows their picture has been taken. And the system always knows. Everyone\u2019s whereabouts are always known with the Magic Bands.\n\nWell, I opened up their memory maker photo album and, I swear, there\u2019s 732 pictures. The first 30 or so are pretty normal. Epcot, a few rides, in front of the castle. But the rest. The rest are all in It\u2019s a Small World. The rides only take one picture per go around. So it appears as though this family has ridden this ride over 700 times. The first picture was pretty normal. Everyone looked happy, it was busy day and a full car of guests.  The next one is rough to look at. The car is empty except for this little family and they look so darn confused. The next 10\\-15 I can see dad getting angry, yelling. Mom is holding onto those two kids like her life depends on it and you can see the kids getting increasingly upset, crying. And it goes on, and on, and on. After 50 or so it looks like they\u2019re trying to get out. In one the dad is missing. In another they\u2019re all gone.  Maybe like they\u2019ve bailed early in the ride and tried to walk out, but in the very next one, they\u2019re all right back in that damn car. After around 450 or so, I only see the mom and kids. It\u2019s just when I look closely I can see dad, maybe just his body now, slumped down in one of the other seats. Since about 675, there\u2019s just mom and one kid. Another body in another seat.  The mom and kid aren\u2019t moving anymore. I think them two are still alive, just damn near catatonic. Looking straight ahead, pale.  \n\nAnd, y\u2019all, I swear on my fucking life, the dolls are moving or something. In some of these pictures I can tell they aren\u2019t where they should be. I even saw one with a doll in the car with this family.\n\nI can\u2019t look anymore or I\u2019m going to lose my lunch. I closed the album. It\u2019s file sized has increased since I closed it. God, are there new pictures being added? \n\nI see on security cameras that the local PD just arrived so they\u2019ll take over soon. I wish I knew what the fuck is going on, but I also wish this damn thing had never landed in my lap. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to update this. After I talk to the police, I think I\u2019m going to walk out of here and never come back. I just wanted to get this out there, before Disney feeds the media some bullshit cover up as to why a whole family vanished. They didn\u2019t vanish. I know where they are.",

I worked there back in 2012, and right before I left to start my new job I decided to use my free entry one more time. I hit all the usual rides and before I left the park for the last time as a cast member, I wanted to get all nostalgic and ride Small World. \n\nIt was all well and good until the end of the Europe section. There was like a sweet, little Swiss Alps girl that I noticed that wasn\u2019t in the Switzerland section. I mean she was close, but I\u2019d ridden that thing like 100 times and knew it like the back of my hand. But I was like whatever, I\u2019m definitely not in the inner circle and they don\u2019t need my approval to change the location of the puppets. \n\nThen, I shit you not I saw her again in each of the next four areas. Only she wasn\u2019t dancing and singing along with the other characters. Just sort of lurking in the background, but still very visible. It was one of those things where i didn\u2019t really believe what I was seeing, but I was absolute certain of what I saw. \n\nSo, it was late at night, I was on the ride by myself since I was friends with the people that ran the ride, and I was thoroughly freaked out. I was doing anything to distract myself and then I make it to the little finale of the ride. I\u2019ll never forget, I saw that little fucking piece of shit doll hugging the sign that said shalom. \n\nFirst rationalization thought was that it was a prank, that somehow my dickhead friends set this up. But they were adamant that they didn\u2019t, and that it couldn\u2019t be possible, they don\u2019t have duplicates of the puppets. If one breaks, they either fix it after Park has closed or get a new one specially made. \n\nApparently Swiss alps girl had been decommissioned because no matter how many times they fixed her, she still wouldn\u2019t seem to dance or sing with the rest of the puppets.

                                    "comment": "I rode Small World for the last time in the 90s. I will NEVER step foot on that ride again. Even when I have taken my kids to Disney I absolutely REFUSE to get on that ride! \n\nI still sometimes have nightmares about what I saw in there, and I was not the only one. I went on a school trip at the end of the year. It was night when we went on it, we had already been on every other ride at least 2 times and someone in our group has been begging to ride it since earlier in the day, so we finally agreed. It was close to closing time and our last ride for the night, so I think we were the only people riding, or if there were others there were only a couple of them. We had about 6 people in our group. \n\nI will NEVER be able to forget this for as long as I live. We were about half way through, I don't remember which country we were in, or really anything about my surroundings, I was so freaked out I couldn't focus on anything else. My friend had started tugging voilently on my arm so I look over at her. She has tears in her eyes, her mouth is wide open and she is trying to speak but can't get anything out, and she is just forcefully pointing down at the water under us. Just the expression on her face and the way she was acting was enough to terrify me, and I really didn't want to look down, but I had to know what had scared her so badly. I forced my gaze away from her and slowly leaned over the side. There was only a few inches in between the boat and the wall, but it was enough. The water under us was full of countless disembodied faces, all of them frozen in pain, full of terror, their mouths open in silent screams. I started screaming at the top of my lungs, scaring the shit out of everyone. They start turning around or reaching forward to try and calm me down, but I just kept saying something like \"they are under us, OMG there are so many of them, in the water, they are trapped in the water\". So of course everyone immediately starts leaning over and trying to look into the water, but there is nothing there. Just the murky water and the rails that the boats ride on. \n\nMy friend and I were inconsolable, as soon as we started to get off the ride, the person that was at the controls came running up to us asking if we were ok. My friend and I tried to tell them what we saw through our tears, and as soon as I said something about faces in the water her expression froze and all the color drained from her face, the way she responded said it all. She managed to quickly collect herself and try to reassure us, telling us that it was just reflections from the dolls faces, but we knew better. \n\nOur friends guided us back to the park entrance where we waited for everyone else. They wanted us to tell the chaperones but we refused, we knew no one would believe us. So we just left and didn't speak of it again. I have stayed friends through out the years with the other girl that saw what I saw, and she has NEVER returned to Disney and probably never will, and I don't blame her at all. We have tried to talk about what we saw a couple of times, but within a few minutes we both start to get to upset to continue. ALL I can think is what caused all of those poor souls to be trapped like that, where did the come from, why are they stuck there, and why are they screaming and terrified in what is supposed to be the happiest place on earth?

That place felt evil the last time I was on the ride, I was just too young to know then to trust my gut, but subconsciously the majority of our group had been trying to avoid it all day, it wasn't until our one friend insisted that we ride it that was finally gave it and went on the ride. And every time I have had to walk past it since then I get this sick feeling in the pit of my stomach and my instincts start screaming at me to get away from it, and my instincts have never been wrong. It radiates evil, sadness and death, I know when I am getting near it before I even see it because my instincts tell me I am close. I would not be surprised to find out that there is some gate way to hell hidden in there, or that the robots are possessed by demons or something terrible. \n\nOne thing I do know for sure, is that I will NEVER step foot in there again and I will NEVER let my kids in there. Thankfully they are too old to really find any interest in it now, and I have always steered them clear of it when ever we have gone to Disney, so I am not  sure that they are even aware that it is a ride that you can go on, and I plan to keep it that way until they are mature enough for me to tell them the truth about it.

I remember wanting to go on it this one day and towards the time we were going to leave we were going to and the ward like no line or anything but as we started to walk up I remember thinking how eerie it looked and got this wave of anxiety. I remember saying that we could actually just go home but I can't remember if we ended up going on it anyways but I know that was the last time I ever went near it. I'll never forget how foreboding it felt walking towards it and just everything about that incident is still so clear in my mind how the ambiance looked as night settled in and it seemed so dark and unwelcoming. The exact opposite of how rides are supposed to make you feel.\n\n\nPlus,  dolls are creepy as fuck as is. Yuuuck\n\nEdit: this was at Disneyland though",

Not like singing or anything like the rest but just slowly turning to face the cart till it left that part of the ride and showed up in the next and kept that staring thing up.  I don\u2019t remember much about my trip since I was a young girl at the time just that I never went back to a Disney park after",

Turning into dolls would give them too much reality to hold onto. The pain would stop being as psychological, and it'd let them focus too much on the physical. It'd be wasteful.",

We decided to ride Pirates of the Caribbean, back in the days before the Disney film adaptation was implemented on the ride. Well, turns out that a couple of the boats were experiencing mechanical issues I suppose. \n\nMy family's boat got stuck for 15 to 20 minutes at the boat and fort cannon fight. You know, with the water spraying at you to simulate cannonballs  falling short of their targets. \n\nWe also were stuck in the town scene for around the same time limit, and a couple times afterward for shorter increments. To this day we joke about the dialogue, such as \"Oh Carlos, don't be chicken!\", as well as the song, because we heard it repeated so many times. \n\nOh and we missed seeing the special 4th of July fireworks. But we heard them.\n\nI believe Disney may have comped the trip, but we still joke about going on Pirates. We seldom do. Even when my siblings and I are with friends.\n\nAnyway that's my ride story, thanks for reading. And remember, Dead Men sometimes DO tell tales. ",

I mean, that was so creepy and weird to read about the family members trying to get out and the dad slumped  down, to them vanishing and then appearing again, and then just the mom and 1 kid, like, WHAT ON EARTH?! It's like the most \"innocent\" ride in the park lol, and it's apparently now the CREEPIEST LOL. I don't know what to think, especially with one of the dolls in the car!!! CREEEEPPPYYYY!!!!\n\nWhere are the family though? Because I'm so confused, especially with their pictures still being added, like....that's just bizarre O.O\n\nI honestly never liked that freakin ride, it's so boring, I'm so glad I never experienced a creepy ghost ride O.o\n\nTHANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR STORY THOUGH!!!! :)",

Right before the main big hill there's this creepy dark tunnel with glowing bats and bugs on the walls and THAT is where our ride got stuck. On the steep incline, at night, with the creepy glowy critters. Another train came up behind us and after 15 minutes the Disney crew came and got us. We had to walk up some stairs in the pitch dark with linked arms basically.\n\nEdit: sorry this was at Disneyland not the World version.",

We went on Small World and it broke down about half way through, the music and boat had stopped but the puppets didn\u2019t. My poor little sisters and I were terrified as we listened to the snap of their mouths and cranks of their gears. I haven\u2019t taken my 4 year old on it despite being a former cast member who visits the parks 4+ times a year. This ride is like a horror movie waiting to happen.",

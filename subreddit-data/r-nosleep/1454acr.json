    "postText": "So I guess newsreaders can hide their emotions really well on TV. I\u2019ve never seen Mary Markov in any state of heightened temper. The time she came down to help after I\u2019d burned down the FunFlair building with Frankie was definitely a first in that regard. Then again, I\u2019d never committed arson before either, so there were a lot of firsts that night. It\u2019s been two days, but I can still see her angry face before me when I close my eyes. It frightened me a little. \n\nAfter the fire had been doused by her staff, she gave Fran and me a look unlike anything I\u2019d ever seen before. There was a homicidal rage in her eyes, her mouth had turned into a thin, steely line and the vein on her forehead threatened to pop. To my surprise (and admittedly relief), she turned the entirety of that wrath against Frankie Preston. \u201cWhat in the world were you thinking?\u201d she thundered, looming dangerously over the shorter man. \u201cYou committed a goddamn crime! If you were a normal person, I\u2019d have to get you behind bars now!\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, I\u2019m the privileged one here?\u201d he snapped. \u201cThat woman tortured me! She brought me into this world *by fault* and proceeded to make me wish I\u2019d never been born! And there was nothing I could ever do about it, because, oh, that\u2019s right, *I\u2019m not a normal person!* As you so endearingly put it. No one has a fucking clue what I am, so it\u2019s okay for me to suffer, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nMary opened her mouth to respond, but only ended up shutting it again. Then she focused her scrutiny onto me. \u201cI thought you\u2019d have known better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the inconvenience, but I knew what I was getting myself into. This was a contemplated decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas it ever.\u201d\n\nI motioned for her to step aside with me, bringing a bit of distance between ourselves and my waiter. \u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you,\u201d I began. \u201cI will, but please, *please* drop this.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he force you to come?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t actually believe he could force me into anything, do you?\u201d\n\nMary Markov sighed. \u201cI guess not. Look, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t understand his grudge. And from what I know of Ms Wallis, she won\u2019t be missed by many. I just wish it didn\u2019t have to come to this. This means a ton of work for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means so much more to him.\u201d\n\nAnother sorrowful moan. Then, \u201cAlright. I have your back. But don\u2019t, um\u2026 *encourage* this kind of behavior in him, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I promised. \u201cWhat are you going to do about the other doll?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s in bad shape\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTrash shape,\u201d Fran chimed in from behind, having inconspicuously strayed closer.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s in bad shape,\u201d Mary repeated, pointedly ignoring him, \u201cand currently unresponsive, but since you said she\u2019s shown signs of sentience, I guess we\u2019ll have to look into her. It prompts a very interesting question, after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing?\u201d I offered.\n\n\u201cThink about it. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with the other two living dolls, Zion Boyd and Bunny Martell, but they came alive after Frank tinkered with them. And now there\u2019s this one. Maybe your little boyfriend has some kind of yet to be explored ability, seeing as he was the first to gain awareness.\u201d She fell silent for a pregnant pause, glancing between the two of us. \u201cSomething to ponder on your drive home. Which you will be starting now.\u201d She made a shooing motion with both her hands. \n\nThe message being quite clear, Frankie and I got back into his car. The ride was quiet at first, but it wasn\u2019t an uncomfortable stillness. It felt like a weight I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d been carrying had been lifted. I stared at the server\u2019s profile, alternately framed by nightly darkness and moonlight, drinking in every little detail about it. It was hard to believe that someone as cruel as Philomena Wallis had created something this breathtaking.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ll probably wanna talk about all of this, huh. About what I am, I mean.\u201d Frankie\u2019s voice was light and relaxed with only a hint of uncertainty gnawing at it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s there to talk about?\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you surprised? A little\u2026 disgusted, maybe?\u201d\n\n\u201cI always knew you weren\u2019t human. Beyond that, it doesn\u2019t really matter to me what you are.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI mean, I\u2019d be fine if you were human, too. I\u2019d be fine if you were a squonk.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a squonk?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just made that up. Anyways, did you actually think I would be grossed out? Did you?\u201d\n\nHe smiled. \u201cI guess not. This\u2019ll sound crazy, and it\u2019s hard to explain, but it\u2019s like I got a voice in the back of my head constantly telling me that\u2026 that I should wash myself again or that I ought not to touch you. I suppose it\u2019s not really a voice; it\u2019s only these thoughts that kind of keep pushing into my mind even though I should know better. And I do know better. But that doesn\u2019t stop the thoughts.\u201d\n\n\nI nodded slowly. \u201cI think I understand. I can\u2019t tell you how much I disagree with that voice, though. You\u2019re the cleanest person I\u2019ve ever met and if I could, I\u2019d live in your hair like a cootie.\"\n\n\"That's how close you want me?\"\n\n\"Yup.\u201d\n\nHe let out a soft laugh. \u201cI\u2019m really, really glad you came with me. If there\u2019s ever anything you need, I\u2019ll do it. No matter what. If you want to bury a body, I\u2019ll dig the hole.\u201d He paused. \u201cActually, we should sell any corpses you might have. It\u2019s wonderfully lucrative.\u201d\n\nI shot him a quick smile before turning to stare out the window with knitted brows. \u201cWhat do you think about what Mary Markov said? About you being able to make the dolls come alive somehow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything to it. I don\u2019t remember doing anything special with them. Zion and Bunny were just standing around when I turned them on, and they came to within minutes. I figured they were sentient before, and it was simply repressed. I woke up randomly, too, after all.\u201d\n\nI hummed pensively. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re implying it\u2019s some kinda superpower, then that\u2019s probably the most useless one ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk about this now,\u201d I told him, to which he gave me a grateful half-grin.\n\nPer my request, he dropped me off at Nettie\u2019s place. I kissed him goodbye on the crown of his head and told him we\u2019d text the following day. He thanked me again and I watched him drive off before going up to ring the doorbell, mentally preparing an apology for showing up at five-thirty in the morning. My savior human was surprisingly quick to answer, giving me an indulgent wave as soon as I stumbled over my first \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI hadn\u2019t gone to bed yet.\u201d\n\nI gave her an incredulous look and she sighed, crossing her arms in front of her chest. Her normally soft, rounded cheeks were sunken, her eyes oddly dull. Judging from the angry red marks, she\u2019d apparently been chewing on her lower lip with some force. It was only then that I took note of the sweater she was wearing. A faded, shaggy piece of fabric that clearly hadn\u2019t been washed since Kit Sutton had given it to her on the cliff that day. I felt a sharp pang in my chest and pulled her into a hug as soon as I\u2019d stepped inside with her.\n\nShe stifled a sob when she wrapped her arms around me in return. \u201cIt\u2019s hit or miss with me when it comes to sleep lately,\u201d she confessed in a brittle voice. \n\nI swallowed. \u201cI\u2019m working on it. I\u2019ll get her back for you, I have a lead. Is there anything I can do in the meantime?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really. I just gotta distract myself \u2018til the morning comes, I\u2019ll be fine then.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll stay up with you.\u201d\n\nIt was thus decided. We sat down in the living room for a while, then went out into the garden to watch the sunrise. My savior human had taken her place in her mother\u2019s chair while I whipped up some chocolate chip pancakes (one of her favorites) for her for breakfast. I carried them out to her on a little plate with a cup of tea, and for a moment, her expression cleared up for a beam of happiness to shine through. \u201cWe should do something productive,\u201d she remarked, and I gave her a questioning tilt of the head. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d she went on. \u201cIsn\u2019t it weird how all these years, you didn\u2019t hop dimensions once, and now all of a sudden it keeps happening?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always worry, baby girl. It\u2019s my natural state of being.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d I insisted. \u201cIt feels wrong. You have your own problems, I don\u2019t want to add to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeriously, that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here. This is just how I keep my mind off\u2026 things.\u201d\n\nI rolled my lips together. *Blue-haired things, probably.* \u201cYou deserve so much better. You deserve this to be way, way easier,\u201d I stated.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a nice thought. But it doesn\u2019t change anything right now. You can control your body, can\u2019t you? Your teeth and tentacles?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. It happens automatically when I get scared sometimes, but for the most part, I\u2019m actively doing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen how about if we could somehow start getting you on top of your dimension jumping, too? It would be a tad risky and I\u2019m not sure how to go about it exactly, but it would be far better if you could toggle it. You\u2019d be able to stop yourself from hopping when you don\u2019t want to, but maybe you could venture into these other spaces for exploration purposes, too.\u201d The words spilled out of her like a babbling little waterfall as she plucked apart one of her pancakes and stuffed them into her mouth. \u201cBecause there has to be more to this. I just have that feeling. So I reckon we try and find a way to work with this. What do you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. I guess I\u2019d be\u2026 open to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? I-I don\u2019t want to pressure you\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, it sounds fine! I wanna try!\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay!\u201d She set aside her plate, rubbing her hands in blatant excitement. \u201cSo it happens when your flight instinct kicks in, correct? How about we get you in that headspace on purpose?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow would we do that?\u201d I asked cautiously.\n\nWhen I was sitting cross-legged on the ground among my savior human\u2019s countless flowers with my eyes closed and her hand in mine, that question had pretty much answered itself. Nettie Peterson was leading me in a \u201cguided meditation\u201d consisting of several intrusive queries about my first ever jump\u2014the most terrifying moment of my entire life. \n\n\u201cThe thing, that floating maw, what did it look like?\u201d she began, referring to the creature that had ended it all.\n\nI furrowed my brows. \u201cIt didn\u2019t *look like* anything,\u201d I replied meekly. \u201cMostly, it was just\u2026 really big and dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cDark? What color dark?\u201d\n\n\u201cBlack, I guess. It swallowed the light.\u201d A pulsating pain began to flare up behind my forehead. \u201cIt was nothing. It was like a giant ball of nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou told me once that it made a noise,\u201d my best friend went on, her fingers grasping mine a little tighter. \u201cDo you remember that sound?\u201d\n\nI winced. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cDescribe it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was more like a vibration that went through everything,\u201d I mumbled. \u201cThe ground was shaking. And then we all screamed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see inside its mouth?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. There was nothing inside of its mouth. There was nothing inside of *it*. Just emptiness.\u201d I shifted my weight. Images were flashing in front of my inner eye, filling the darkness behind my closed lids. My breath had caught in my throat and it felt like ants were crawling beneath my skin. \u201cAnd then all of us were suddenly\u2026 *nothing*, everything was gone and at that last moment, everyone was so terrified. They all knew it was over. All of them.\u201d\n\nAt first, I thought Nettie Peterson\u2019s hand was trembling. Then I realized it was my own, shaking hers through the contact. For a moment, my body felt feather-light, but not in a relaxing or comfortable way. It was as though I was afloat, out of control and weightless. I didn\u2019t like it. \u201cCan we stop?\u201d I choked out. \n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d my best friend replied, gently squeezing my fingers. \n\nI let go of a deep breath, blinking my eyes open. Across from me, Nettie was giving me a soft but deeply apologetic smile. \u201cDid I push you too far?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. I think I simply wasn\u2019t ready for this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand. Let\u2019s go inside and make some more of those\u2014\u201d She stopped mid-sentence. She\u2019d been pointing her chin at the plate of pancakes resting on her chair, only to see that it had *changed*.\n\nThe food I had just served her half an hour ago had turned into a moldy, rotten mess. A couple flies were circling it, emitting a low, almost melodic buzz. My savior human and I traded wide-eyed glances, disbelief, fear and excitement mirrored in our eyes. We then got up to take in our surroundings. The flowers surrounding us weren\u2019t the same anymore. They were either withered or deathly pale; formerly pink, yellow and red petals had become either light gray or iridescently white. Thick, soupy fog was hanging over everything, it was denser and heavier than any we\u2019d ever had in town before. The mist seemed to have consumed all the noise and color in the world, leaving only cold, oppressive silence. \n\nNettie was the first to regain speech. \u201cIt worked! Oh my Lord, it actually worked.\u201d\n\nI clasped her arm and she immediately fell silent. Wordlessly, I pointed at the rolling fog on the other side of the garden fence. There was something *moving* within. An enormous, caterpillar-like shape soundlessly dragged itself through the air, its long body slowly moving along across the street. My savior human\u2019s jaw had dropped, her mouth wide open as she followed my gaze. Neither of us moved a muscle as we waited for the creature to pass by. Thankfully, it didn\u2019t seem to take note of us at all. I didn\u2019t want to imagine what could happen if one were to draw its attention. \n\n\u201cThis is\u2026 I don\u2019t believe this,\u201d Nettie breathed, running a hand over her mussed coils. \u201cYou did it. We\u2019re not home anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you propose to do now?\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep our heads low and try to find out anything useful, I\u2019d say.\u201d\n\nI nodded and she folded her hand into the crook of my arm. Together, we proceeded through the open door back into the house. Wammawink and Nettie\u2019s old convertible were standing in their garage, a pool of motor fluid surrounding each vehicle. The paint was peeling from the car doors, matching the way the pictures and photographs around her house had faded. \n\nThe food in her kitchen had morphed into a self-contained ecosystem. Bugs were crawling up and down the walls and ghostly white mice scuttled across the floor with shocking brazenness. There was no trace of human life anywhere in sight. We stepped out the front door and into the street only for Nettie to grab me and fling me to the ground next to her. We flattened ourselves against the curb as another one of the gigantic caterpillar-figures snaked its way along just a couple feet above our heads. I craned my neck to give my best friend a sidelong glance out of terrified, saucer-sized eyes. I could see my reflection in hers as she pressed a finger to her lips. I gave her a tiny nod. \n\nFinally, it was gone again and we helped each other to our feet. Nettie brushed down her sweater with great care before tilting her head at me as though asking if I was alright. I gave a reassuring, albeit wavering smile which she returned with a slight strain to her brow. We linked arms again and started walking down the street. The whole dimension seemed to be a mirror image of our hometown, only deader. Aside from the flies and vermin, there seemed to be very little life. All of the houses we were so familiar with looked decrepit, old and empty. Walls were crumbling down, roofs looked to be seconds away from caving in and most windows were shattered. It was impossible to see ahead through the mist, but we managed to hide from the flying worm-things everytime they came up. \n\nWe were starting to become a little frustrated seeing as our exploration yielded nothing of note. There was hardly anything to be seen safe from the depressing alternate version of our neighborhood. On top of that, the clammy chill that hung in the air along with the fog was making us increasingly uncomfortable. Finally, we decided we should try and get back home. We returned to Nettie\u2019s garden where we crouched down once again, hand in hand. Before my savior human could begin her questioning though, the ground beneath us suddenly began to shudder, heaving as if moved by some kind of subterranean pulse.\n\nNettie Peterson and I snapped our eyes open at the exact same time, mouths agape in bewilderment. And then we saw it. It was in the sky, partially veiled by the thick fog yet impossible to overlook. It became darker and darker as it neared, its indescribably large form seemed to envelop the entirety of the heavens. It had been five years since I had last seen it, but I recognized it immediately. Not that it had any features I could have recognized. I remembered though, and in that moment, it all came flooding back to me. The breeders that threw themselves in front of their young, the cries that echoed across the plains together with the stones and soil sent rolling by the earthquake. I caught my best friend\u2019s gaze, read the terror in it and knew that it was just as immense as my own. Her lips were parted in an ear-piercing scream that ended up being drowned out by the hovering roar of the Devourer Of Worlds.\n\nI squeezed her hand so tightly I feared I\u2019d snap her fingers. And suddenly, before I knew it, all was silent again. The air was warmer, filled with the fragrances of countless different flowers. The early morning sun was shining down on us, and it felt like it was heating up my very core. We were back. In the blink of an eye, Nettie had thrown her arms around me, pulling me close to her chest. \n\n\u201cBaby girl,\u201d she whispered. \n\n\u201cThat was it,\u201d I rasped out. \u201cThat was it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Withdrawing just an inch, she wiped a thumb over my eye, careful not to scrape me with her nail. It was only then that I realized I was crying. Tears were streaming down my cheeks, noiseless and hot, dripping from my chin and wetting my chest. \n\n\"You're not hurt, are you? Look, it's going to be alright. You just take it easy now. We'll go inside, have some tea or coffee or whatever and calm down, a-and then we can figure this all out. Come on. Get up. Easy, easy now.\" She hugged me even as she pulled me to my feet and into the house alongside her. \"So tea. How about strawberry? Or Turkish apple? Or classic chamomile? Something for the nerves, at any rate.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" I stammered, interrupting her monologue. \"What about you? Are you okay?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. No, no, no, far from it. I'll sign us both up for therapy once I find the time, but for now, tea! Tea.\" \n\n\"Nettie, please don't strain yourse\u2014\"\n\n\"Listen here, I'm gonna make you some goddamn tea and we'll sit down with it and it's gonna be warm and nice and we'll forget all about this. I'm here. I can take care of you. You *do not* need to be scared.\" She pressed her face close up to mine, her voice sharp and a mite threatening.\n\n\"I'm sort of scared of *you* right now.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" She drew back. \"Pardon. I'll put on the tea.\" A forced, crooked tune tumbled from her lips as she went ahead into the kitchen.\n\nWe've both simmered down a little since the incident. It's been two days now. I used most of that time to unwind and recover from what had to be the single most eventful night of my time here on earth. Keep in mind, this happened the morning after the fire. The calm is not going to last much longer, though. I don't mind that, I just need to brace myself. \n\nRhonda's been in touch.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13dr5g0/help_im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[2:

That's a bit close to home for my liking. \nMaybe when you are feeling more up to it you can try an experiment where you hold a place in your mind and get yourself psyched up, get your adrenaline pumping somehow and see if you can jump to a similar place. There has to be other reality jumpers around because Jewels knew about it. Maybe the news lady can help you find a mentor ?

While your surroundings so far have somewhat resembled where you are when you first shifted, I'd like to remind you that way back when your primary homeworld got devoured (I'm sorry, btw) you ended up on Earth and it wasn't the least painful experience.

Don't worry, after what we saw, I'll be dialing back test runs for the time being. However, it might be necessary for me to practice dimension jumps. \n\nIn an attempt to take away from your concern, consider this: I jump (forth *and* back again) whenever I am in distinct fear for my own life. Therefore, if I ever wind up in a place that could kill me, I will immediately be forced to jump back as soon as my flight instinct kicks in. I believe that makes things relatively safe.",

Please be good to yourself now, you need to recuperate. \n\nMaybe the witches have an idea to help you free Kit. But her father is so powerful, I really am at a loss on what they can do. He will just use force to snatch her back again - at least that\u2019s what I think. \n\nStay safe Eva!",

I seriously don't believe I'm that powerful. \n\nI get where you're coming from, but I do things to please him knowingly. I go to all that trouble because it's worth it to me. Besides, like I said during the first real conversation he and I ever had at the diner, I would have helped him whether or not he liked me back romantically. I even asked him at the start if he wanted to get to know me *outside of me helping him*, and he said yes. I definitely wrote that down in my first post. \n\nI see what you mean, but I'm okay with doing these things for him. And perhaps I'm vain, but I don't like the word 'used'. It makes me feel small. I'm not being used or groomed. I'm doing something for someone. I have agency, and it's my decision. A decision that I made on my own and which I'm responsible for. I know you're saying what you're saying to help so please don't take this the wrong way, I mean no offense.\n\nAnd no, the corpse thing was no joke at all. He sold the other body, remember? He gave me half the money and everything.",

After all, look what he was designed to be and do. Once he became sentient things changed, but he was created to be pleasing to people, and even though that's not his primary desire at this point, I'm sure it's nigh-impossible to kick some of that training. Especially since he *does* like Eva, and *does* care whether she likes him back. I have the impression that this is a first for him. \n\nSo I'm inclined to give him a bit of extra leeway. I mean, that was a HELL of a bad childhood he had. I feel like he came out of it remarkably functional, to be honest.",

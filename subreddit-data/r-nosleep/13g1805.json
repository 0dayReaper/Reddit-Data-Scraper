Please contact stores individually for a complete list of regulations and opening times.*\n\nThe first time I encountered the Midnight Mall, I hadn\u2019t been looking for it. None of us had even heard of it before. And by us, I mean Mike, Remy, Carter, and me. The Frightful Four. That\u2019s what we had been calling ourselves for years, ever since a pissed off substitute had bestowed the title upon us in the seventh grade. She said the four of us together was a teacher\u2019s worst fear, and although she had obviously meant it as an insult, it was a moniker we tried our best to live up to. While others (mostly conservative, middle-aged Algebra teachers) trembled before us, we aimed to live life to the fullest, never cowering before anything or anyone. In middle school, that meant staying up late playing Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s and watching Nightmare on Elm Street; but as we grew older, we grew more restless. Craving adventure, adrenaline, that nighttime feeling\u2026and I guess that\u2019s how we found the Midnight Mall.\n\nKind of. Not really. Like I said, at the time, we didn\u2019t know it existed. We were trying to break into the mall. Not to shoplift or vandalize \u2013 we just wanted somewhere to hang out without our parents snooping around. And since Carter was working the closing shift at the food court, he had perfect access to the Employees Only back door to sneak us in.\n\nRemy had grabbed a half-empty bottle of fruit schnapps from her mom\u2019s stash and Mike had scored a handful of weed gummies, and our plan was to get crossed in the parking lot, wait for Carter to sneak us in, then fuck around the empty halls, dodging the janitors and, I don\u2019t know, probably daring each other to make out with the faceless mannequins or something.\n\nOur lives would have looked a lot different if we had stuck to that plan.\n\nOr if we had taken the stairs instead of the elevator. If Mike hadn\u2019t dared Remy to press the \u2018Do Not Touch\u2019 button on our way up. If it hadn\u2019t taken us down, down, down onto a lower level that even Carter had never seen before. If I had listened to the awful feeling in my gut and refused to get out.\n\nSo many ifs, buts and maybes, but none of that matters. What matters is that we were the Frightful Four, ready to take on the world, and when we stepped out of the elevator and saw a plain wooden door next to a set of rules about something called the Midnight Mall, we looked at each other, laughed, and headed inside. None of us thought it was going to be anything more than a weird prank.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the first thing Carter said when we walked through the door. And I\u2019m pretty sure we were all thinking the same thing. We had been expecting some cramped and dingy storage closet, hidden away in a space where almost nobody could find it.\n\nInstead, we walked into an exact replica of our mall.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what it looked like. It was as though we had blinked and found ourselves back at the entrance of the first floor. Kiosks, boutiques, the food court up ahead. The layout was a clear copy, and if it weren\u2019t for the hordes of people wandering around and enjoying themselves, I would have thought the elevator had glitched and we had simply gone in a weird loop back to the first floor.\n\nAgain: *if.*\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Remy said. \u201cWhat just happened? What is this place?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Midnight Mall,\u201d Mike replied, a dopey smile on his face. \u201cDuh. Didn\u2019t you read the sign?\u201d\n\n\u201cI read it just fine. But that doesn\u2019t explain - this. We were three floors underground.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we still are,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this place is huge!\u201d Remy argued.\n\nMike just shrugged. \u201cKiera is right. How would we have gotten back upstairs? Besides, some places build parking garages that go ten stories lower than we are. This place must have been built by a badass architect.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut where did all these people come from?\u201d Remy pressed. \u201cThere were barely any cars in the parking lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey probably Ubered,\u201d Mike said. His nose scrunched up the way it always did when he was annoyed. \u201cOr they parked somewhere else so they wouldn\u2019t spill the secret. Probably because this place is one of those cool underground finds. A find that we\u2019re completely ignoring \u2013 come on, you saw the sign. The place closes at 3:33. We only have a few hours. Are we really going to spend it arguing about semantics? Us? The Frightful Four?\u201d\n\nAt that, Remy pursed her lips. Although she was the most cautious of all of us, she was also the most prideful \u2013 and she\u2019d never live down an accusation of being scared.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Mike said. \u201cLet\u2019s see what this place has to offer.\u201d\n\nEyes wide, we followed Mike a few steps forward to a large directory. There were hundreds of store names written in tiny font \u2013 more stores than I thought could physically fit into a mall \u2013 but I didn\u2019t recognize most of the names. Not like I had brought much shopping money with me.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we check out the pet store?\u201d I recommended. Partially because dogs were adorable, but mostly because petting puppies and cuddling kittens cost nothing.\n\n\u201cThat sounds alright,\u201d Mike agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s a night mall, so maybe they\u2019ll have some sick nocturnal animals. I\u2019ve always wanted to pet an owl.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m allergic to cats,\u201d Carter reminded.\n\n\u201cThen don\u2019t pet any of the cats,\u201d Mike said.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we see a movie instead,\u201d Remy suggested. She glanced at her watch. \u201cWe still have ten minutes before it starts.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut movies cost money,\u201d I said. \u201cBesides, we can watch a movie anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you can find owls in literally any forest.\u201d\n\nLike most of our arguments, nobody was keen to switch sides. And so, in the end, we chose to split up. I know, I know. Classic horror movie mistake. But then, you never think you\u2019re in horror movie territory until it\u2019s too late. At the time, I thought the place was bizarre as hell, but I figured we were in a more surreal, Wes Anderson type situation.\n\nSo, while Carter and Remy went to check out the cinema, Mike and I headed toward the pet shop.\n\nAs we made our way through the crowds of people, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that a lot of out-of-towners had made their way to this strange attraction. My town wasn\u2019t small by any stretch, but it wasn\u2019t New York City, either. We rarely had tourists. And yet, every few feet, I heard people speaking French, Mandarin, Spanish. And the styles were strange, too. Although the majority of people looked normal enough, some wore trailing Victorian dresses or steam-punk attire.\n\n\u201cThe Midnight Mall,\u201d I mused, my thoughts growing hazier as the edibles kicked in. Maybe that\u2019s why everything felt so surreal and dreamlike. \u201cYou think we stumbled on some kind of comic con?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Mike said.\n\nBut I could tell he wasn\u2019t really listening. We had made it to the pet store, and all of his attention was now focused on finding the coolest birds of prey.  As Mike roamed the aisles, I looked around the front of the store. The aisles were lined with boxes of treats, toys, and frou-frou outfits, and there were tons of wire cages housing puffy-cheeked hamsters, sleeping kittens, and sad-looking dogs.\n\nI headed closer to the dogs. There were only three or four in the cages, and all of them perked up when I took a step forward. A few of them whined in anticipation. Poor things. I wondered how long they had waited here, hoping someone would stop and take them to their forever home. Although the mall was quite crowded, we were the only customers in the pet shop, so it didn\u2019t seem like they got much business.\n\n\u201cIt must be a lonely life, huh guys?\u201d I said.\n\nAnd it must have been my imagination, but I could have sworn the golden retriever closest to me actually nodded his head. Eyebrows raised, I stepped even closer. I had watched over my neighbor\u2019s golden retriever a few months ago, and this one looked nearly identical to that one\u2026except for the eyes. They were a light green color, half-covered by the dog\u2019s matted hair, and bore straight into my own. I couldn\u2019t have explained it to you, but somehow, those eyes looked more intelligent than any other dog\u2019s I had seen before. More perceptive. More analytical. More human.\n\nI reached a hand towards the cage \u2013 just as Mike squeezed my shoulder. Hard.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the grip, dude?\u201d I demanded, twisting around. But my attitude short-circuited when I realized that Mike was nowhere to be seen.\n\nInstead, an intimidatingly tall and gaunt man stared down at me with blank, sunken eyes. His pale, almost greying skin made it look like he hadn\u2019t stepped foot into the sun \u2013 or perhaps out of this shop \u2013 in months. And I know you shouldn\u2019t judge a book by its cover\u2026but fuck that, I was judging this Nosferatu look-alike hard. Especially since his yellowing fingernails were currently digging quarter-moons into my shoulders.\n\nI jerked away from him. \u201cE-excuse me,\u201d I said, trying to sound more annoyed than nervous. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo touching.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I would appreciate that very much.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo touching the animals,\u201d he clarified.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said. Some of my indignance deflated. \u201cSorry. Do you work here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. I am the curator.\"\n\n\u201cThe curator? You mean, like you decide what animals to buy for the store?\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s lips thinned. I couldn\u2019t tell if he was unhappy, or if he was suppressing a smile. \u201cSomething like that,\u201d he said.\n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone. But before I could press \u2013 or ask him how much the golden retriever was \u2013 I heard Mike scream.\n\nA howling, terrified scream. I had never heard that kind of desperation in his voice before. Without thinking, I sprinted away, deeper into the store \u2013 and then skidded to a stop. I took a short, shallow breath, my legs frozen with fear.\n\nBecause something was eating Mike. I said something because whatever the animal was, I had never seen anything like it before. It had a long, slithering tail like a rat, the matted fur of a hyena, and the head of a vulture. And it was that long, thin vulture\u2019s beak that was reaching through a gap in its cage to gouge strips of skin from Mike\u2019s thigh.\n\n*Riiiiip.* The nightmarish creature tore another long line of flesh from Mike\u2019s thigh, as easily as if his skin was a fruit roll-up peeling off the bone. Mike jerked forward, but before he could move an inch, the creature speared him once more with its beak.\n\n\u201cFuck!\u201d Mike yelled, his body convulsing as he tried desperately to escape. As he shook, his head jerked to the left and we made eye contact. \u201cFuck! Kiera! Help me!\u201d\n\nWith a burst of adrenaline, I rushed forward, grabbing Mike\u2019s arms and tugging him forward. But the bird wasn\u2019t finished. Threatened by my presence, it clamped its massive beak over Mike\u2019s ankle. When I pulled, it's beak pressed down harder; hard enough that Mike\u2019s curses became an incessant wail, painfully loud and just as animalistic as any of the other creatures in the store.\n\n*Crunch.* Splinters of yellow-white bone shard rose through Mike\u2019s skin like cheese pushed through a grater. In some distant corner of my mind, I was ready to panic-vomit, but I worked in autopilot, my mind going blank as I played tug-o-war with the bird. The creature was much stronger than me, but as I pulled, it yanked more flesh from Mike\u2019s foot \u2013 allowing me just enough wiggle-room to pull him backwards.\n\nWe both fell to the floor, gasping. But there was no time to rest. Mike\u2019s ankle was already a purple, swollen mess decorated with bone splinters, and his left thigh looked even worse. Blood, gaping muscle tissue, tendons shredded like plucked piano chords... Holding in the urge to vomit, I tore off my cardigan and pressed it to the wound. But with the amount of blood he was losing, I knew that wasn\u2019t going to be nearly enough to save him.\n\n\u201cHelp!\u201d I yelled. \u201cSomeone help us!\u201d\n\nMy gaze darted back and forth down the aisles, searching for the Curator, but he was nowhere to be seen. Apparently touching the dogs was a criminal offense, but customers being pecked to death wasn't his problem. I gritted my teeth. Mike was in no condition to walk, but I had to get him to a hospital. And fast. I would let myself think about how fucking insane the situation was after that.\n\nPlacing both my arms underneath his pits, I pulled him backwards with a grunt. Shit. If he made it out of here alive \u2013 no, when, I chastened myself \u2013 I was going to tell him to go on a juice cleanse.\n\n\u201cJust hold on,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d\n\nAnother step backwards. His blood smeared against the tiles, and the vulture let out an enraged squack. Although it had eaten nearly a quarter of Mike\u2019s leg, apparently it had room for seconds. At the sound of the avian cry, Mike gave a harsh whine, his body convulsing in my hold. I tried my best to make soothing noises, even as I jerked him toward the entrance, his ankle bones skidding across the floor in a way that was probably not the most comfortable for him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I repeated. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d\n\nHe craned his neck to look at me, his gaze distinctly not okay.\n\n\u201cThe gummies,\u201d he whispered, his voice hoarse from his screams. \u201cThey were in my back pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. That thing must have ate them. But I wouldn\u2019t worry about that right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gummies. The rules. Don\u2019t bring food into the Pet Store.\u201d He looked up at me with a helpless, haunted expression that I had only seen twice in his life. Once when his younger sister died in a car accident, and again two years later, after his parents divorced from the stress. Now, he looked up at me with that exact same expression and said: \u201cKiera. Where the hell are we?\u201d\n\nAnd then he passed out.\n\n\u201cMike? Mike!\u201d I shook him, but he was out cold. He was running out of time. \u201cDammit.\u201d\n\nPressing my hand against his shredded, weeping skin, I tugged with all my might, finally managing to pull him out of the store. But I hadn\u2019t made it more than three feet when my back hit a sturdy, muscular wall.\n\n\u201cYou seemed to have caused quite the commotion, little lady. Maybe I could be of some help,\" someone said.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I turned around and slowly looked up at the security guard.\n\nYou can read more about the Midnight Mall here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13oxqwo/the\\_seven\\_rules\\_of\\_the\\_midnight\\_mall\\_part\\_ii/",

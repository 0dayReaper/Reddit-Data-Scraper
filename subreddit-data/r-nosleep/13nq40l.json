    "postText": "This whole mess started over on the curlyhair subreddit, of all places. See last year my then wife, Maria, learned her hairdresser was moving to London, and she wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled by the prospect of finding a replacement stylist. What she needed was a personalized haircare giftbag, so I moseyed on over to the sub in search of product recommendations.\n\nImagine my surprise when the #1 post turned out to be a mirror selfie of my better half. Glorious, golden curls surrounded her delicate features, and in the comments, she mourned the fact her \u2018proud lion\u2019s mane\u2019 may never look that majestic again.\n\nI glanced up from my phone. Across the room, Maria lay sprawled across her favourite armchair, scrolling away.\n\nPurely for fun, I awarded the post gold. Anonymously of course.\n\nYou should have seen her goofy grin. She hadn\u2019t smiled like that in months.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d I asked, acting clueless.\n\n\u201cOh, nothing. Just a silly message in the group chat.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s how I discovered the woman I married was ruthlessly aggressive behind the facade of anonymity.\n\nOkay, so it\u2019s not like I expected her and me to grace the cover of \u2018Adorable couples weekly\u2019, but from a deep dive into her posts, you\u2019d think we were a clinical study in dysfunctional relationships. She transcribed entire arguments we had about how to fold the bathroom towels, made constant references to that miserable trip we took to Florence when the airline lost our luggage\u2014which was MY fault somehow?\u2014and couldn\u2019t let a \u2018whats the worst gift you\u2019ve ever received\u2019 thread over on Askreddit slip past her feed without mentioning the Naruto bookends I bought for her birthday.\n\nAdmittedly, I dropped the ball there. The rest seemed totally uncalled for, though. Don\u2019t even get me started on her contributions over on deadbedrooms (let\u2019s just say the terms \u2018cold reptile claw\u2019 and \u2018repulsive little slug\u2019 appeared multiple times).\n\nShe wasn\u2019t much of a writer, but her work had real feeling behind it, which made up for the poor technique.\n\nWas I pissed? You bet I was pissed. However, if I revealed I\u2019d uncovered this \u2018release valve\u2019, Maria would only delete the profile and mock me on a new one. I needed to use this information to relight the fire in her heart.\n\nWith her birthday right around the corner, I studied her profile the way anthropologists study ancient civilizations. Buried amongst the endless comments about her horrible husband, there was a gloomy post about Maria\u2019s favourite band t-shirts which didn\u2019t fit anymore, and another agonizing over how badly it hurt knowing she\u2019d never enjoy her late mother\u2019s cooking again.\n\nA vague idea took root in my mind. Up in the attic, I rummaged through musty boxes, gathering those old threads together.\n\nOn the big day, her royal heinous unfurled a blanket stitched together from the old t-shirts.\n\n\u201cDo you like it?\u201d I asked.\n\nShe came at me with a flurry of kisses. I gave her hand an affectionate squeeze and promised the celebrations weren\u2019t done yet. \u201cI\u2019m making a special birthday celebration dinner: your mothers spaghetti Bolognese.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d hoped that might mark a turning point in our marriage. But Maria couldn\u2019t even wait until morning to post again.\n\n*My jackass husband destroyed clothes with deep sentimental value.*\n\n*Had to wolf down partners attempt at my mom\u2019s recipe. Good thing she\u2019s already dead, because this would have LITERALLY killed her.*\n\nShe lied straight to my face. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nBecause I couldn\u2019t keep my irritation bottled up inside, the toxicity from her posts soon seeped over into our day-to-day lives. Arguments about what to watch on TV would escalate until we both screamed so loud our faces turned purple, we\u2019d side-eye one another for chewing noisily, and if we so much as brushed arms while lying next to each other in bed icy-fingered jolts ran through me. Maria\u2019s attitude became more-and-more like her online alias.\n\nBy now, vague threats underpinned her posts.\n\n*My husband sleeps with his mouth open and it makes me want to throat punch him*\n\n*It\u2019s so suffocating living with my S.O. I swear, sometimes I could just slip a noose around his neck.*\n\nIn the comments, a tsunami of people agreed she married the most unbearable prick on planet Earth, possibly even the galaxy. One Redditor asked her to cheat on me and write a dissertation about the experience.\n\nThere was no point delaying the facts: the rot had eroded our marriage\u2019s very foundations. For my own benefit, I stopped obsessively refreshing the profile, because what was the point? Emotionally speaking, I\u2019d already checked out.\n\nIn need of a good detox, I renewed my gym membership and went drinking on weeknights with high school buddies. Very soon Maria and I became strangers living under the same roof, homing in on an inevitable, messy divorce.\n\nA month later, our 6th wedding anniversary came looming over the horizon. I expected\u2014or hoped, even\u2014the big day might pass without fanfare. Whatever celebrations I planned would only get shredded online later.\n\nImagine my surprise when Maria suggested a romantic, candlelit dinner. Even said she would cook.\n\nAs much as she\u2019d hurt me, the memory of the love we once shared compelled me to at least try giving our marriage the kiss of life. I spent hours agonizing over a magical gift\u2014one even the most cynical of Redditors couldn\u2019t trash.\n\nMy lightbulb moment came while chopping onions late one evening. And boy, was it a doozy.\n\nOn the big night, a thick aroma of garlic and baking bed wafted out from down the hall, which set my stomach grumbling, already anticipating a nice, hot meal. With the sauce simmering on the stove, Maria disappeared upstairs and slipped into a form-hugging purple dress.\n\nShe sat me down at the lounge table, promised the food wouldn\u2019t take much longer. I offered her a wrapped giftbox, but she said we should exchange presents after dessert, and then she disappeared into the kitchen.\n\nWhen the door swung shut behind her, I sunk into my chair, mystified. The abrupt U-turn in her demeanour almost gave me whiplash\u2014what spurred such a dramatic shift? I\u2019d dreaded a tense evening full of snide, cutting remarks.\n\nNo doubt her profile would be full of emotional essays on how terrible she felt about putting me down, about how it took our relationship reaching the absolute brink to make her realize what an incredible, supportive spouse she had.\n\nI grabbed my phone and opened Reddit.\n\nRather than gush about her wonderful husband, the posts continued on like they did before, explaining how I weighed her down. Thousands had been made since I stopped checking\u2014in one day alone, she posted forty-six times. Forty-six. I scrolled with a mounting sense of dread, my heart doing pirouettes in my chest.\n\n*I think my husbands on the verge of walking out.*\n\n*Partner stole 5 years of my life now he runs around with his dumb friends, how do I make him pay?*\n\nIntrusive thoughts *keep telling me to murder my husband, and it\u2019s getting harder to ignore\u2026*\n\nThese unhinged rants spanned two dozen subreddits, half of which banned her due to threats of violence. Several dedicated followers encouraged her along this path.\n\nShe\u2019d officially lost it. Plunged off the deep end. Lost the last of her marbles.\n\nOne post in particular caught my eye over in nostupidquestions, made the same night Maria suggested we have dinner.\n\n*How much anti-freeze does it take to kill a man?*\n\nJust then, she came through the door carrying two plates and sent them down on the table. As she slid in next to me, a dry gulp seized my throat.\n\nMy eyes flicked toward the dish, back at her. I drew a deep inhale and forced a smile. \u201cSmells\u2026delicious.\u201d\n\nOf course she wasn\u2019t poisoning me, how could I even think such a ridiculous thing? Just to be sure, though, I twisted some spaghetti around the fork, held it up to Maria\u2019s mouth, and insisted she take the first bite. \u201cYou\u2019ve worked so hard, you deserve it.\u201d\n\nThose luscious lips pursed shut. Maria\u2019s eyes whipped between me and the fork, big and frightened.\n\n\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d I asked, my heart doing pirouettes in my chest.\n\nWrestling the fork from me, she insisted, insisted I take the first bite, and then tried stabbing it into my mouth. With my mouth clamped shut tighter than a vice grip, I twisted my head from side-to-side.\n\nMaria accused me of insulting her cooking. \u201cHow could you? And on our anniversary.\u201d\n\nI took a deep shuddery inhale. \u201cHoney, did you use any\u2026special ingredients?\u201d\n\nThose eyes, those big puppy dog eyes that I was once so enamoured with, shot open wide. Before I could react, Maria grabbed a knife off the table.\n\nFuelled by adrenaline, I stood so suddenly my chair hit the wall. As she lunged at me, my hands groped along the table for something, anything, to defend myself with. They landed on her anniversary present.\n\nThe knife came down in a shining arc. At the very last second, I held the giftbox in front of my chest like a shield. The blade pierced the outer packaging, becoming wedged on the contents inside, and before Maria could wrestle the knife free, I threw my arms around her waist, scooped her up into the air, and dumped her on the wooden floor, hard.\n\nHer anniversary present\u2014a chopping board engraved with my mothers-in-law\u2019s spaghetti Bolognese recipe\u2014fell onto the rug beside us.\n\nI pinned my wife down, my thighs pressed against either side of her chest. Unable to wriggle free, she screamed and thrashed and called me an asshole. I summoned the police who quickly arrived and arrested her, after a whirlwind of gaslighting and crocodile tears.\n\nMonths have passed since that night. As part of the investigation, I shared Maria\u2019s posts with the detectives. From what the solicitor tells me, her sentencing won\u2019t come up for another seven months, at least, and she\u2019s currently detained in a mental health facility. She gets one hour of supervised internet time a week, and wouldn\u2019t you know it, she channels this into Reddit posts about how I\u2019m the worse husband who ever walked the earth, how she\u2019s going to beat the \u2018phony\u2019 charges, and then expose me for the monster I truly am.\n\nAnd once a week, perhaps out of a morbid sense of lost love, I pour myself a large glass of wine, load up her profile, and dish out some awards\u2026\n\n\\--\n\n(P.S. the only silver lining to this whole mess was Maria helped me discover a bunch of funny cat-related subs, [which cheer me up.

You can have a relationship without it definitely.\n\nThen I met someone I clicked with more than anyone I'd ever been with, who also happened to be from another country. We knew we wanted to be together, but the one of the easiest ways for her to stay long term was being married.\n\nIt was still a big decision, and we still thought it was nice even though it was a small courthouse affair, but it still king of felt like purely going through the motions. The good news is we were right, and we're a perfect match who recently hit six years. We have all the important things in common but enough different to keep it interesting, we're partners but also best friends.\n\nIt wasn't always easy, but in those hard times that silly certificate meant more and more, until suddenly we were this incredibly solid ride or die team. We don't just push and support eachother, but there's this great pride when one of us achieves. She's the first person I speak with in the morning, and seeing her in the afternoon is the best part of my day.\n\nI think marriage gets a bad rap because boomers got married at 18 to the first person they met regardless of commonalities or substance then twenty years later they are sitting across from someone they hardly know or have anything in common with. To me it's now just this formal agreement I take pride in.\n\nNo one should rush in, and like any good relationship it should start based on friendship, amd naturally evolve, and if at some point it's where it leads cool.\n\nAlso, makes a lot of financial sense, tax boons, applying for lians/rentals/whatever much easier and a range of other things you never realise until your in the ball and chain gang.",

To me, it's always been a legal status that carries with it some benefits (at the every least, in most countries the formal recognition of a couple as spouses means they'll actually be placed quite high on the inheritance ladder instead of being a complete stranger in the eyes of the law, and you'll be able to visit them in ER and stuff like that). But then there's, of course, the question of divorce and potential alimony. That said, some people who say \"never get married\" actually mean \"never get into a committed relationship\" (which especially fits considering the story of the main post), and, well, it's a stance I can respect, similar to childfree.",

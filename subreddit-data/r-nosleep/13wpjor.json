    "postText": "My wife Cheryl has been on the waiting list for a new heart for about two years, so when we got the call, we didn\u2019t hesitate to load up the car and get prepped. This was the miracle we were waiting for. The one that doctors told us \nnot to get our hopes up for. \n\nThe donor was a trucker from across state lines, someone who was in the wrong place at the wrong time with an 18 wheeler. His family insisted that having his heart used for a life saving surgery would be exactly what he would have wanted. \n\nCheryl was already in her hospital gown before we even reached the surgical center. I remember squeezing her hand and we prayed together. This felt like a miracle. \n\nWe didn\u2019t know it was about to become a nightmare. \n\nHer brother Max came and brought his two Nintendo Switches with an extra set of controllers to keep us occupied while in the waiting room. We played Mario Kart for about 20 minutes when the first incident happened. \n\nThis hospital is pretty small, so all of the procedures happen in the same ward; including labor and delivery. We were just on the 3rd course of the game when a strange alarm started to blare in the hallway next to us and I jumped up, wondering what was going on. \n\nI thought at first it might be that someone was trying to take a baby from the nursery, foolishly forgetting that the staff put bands on their legs. Instead when I walked into the next set of double doors I saw a woman frozen in place with a surgical knife in her left hand, and a baby in her right. It looked like they had just come out of the procedure room and had just cut the umbilical cord. The baby was crying, bleeding a tad from their belly button. But the nurse was simply standing there, as though she had just forgotten what she was doing. \n\n\u201cMiss\u2026 miss are you okay?\u201d I asked, trying to shake her arm. She felt ice cold. I then turned and looked toward some of the other staff members and realized they too seemed suddenly paralyzed. Phones were dangling off the hook. Orderlies had stopped pushing one woman midway down the hall.  Everything was suspended for no apparent reason. I walked back out of the ward and told Max to call the police. \n\n\u201cSomethings up, like everyone has had a stroke or something,\u201d I muttered to him. \n\nHe nodded and moved toward the elevator, trying to get it to come to our floor. \n\nSuddenly there was a power surge. The lights flickered briefly and Max too seemed frozen. I ran to his side where he was now stuck in place, pressing the button for the elevator. \n\nI started to panic as I moved from room to room, trying to get someone\u2019s help. Why was I not being affected I wondered as I pounded on the double doors to the surgical unit. An orderly in scrubs came to my aid. \n\n\u201cSir, you need to wait,\u201d he said stiffly. \n\n\u201cNo you don\u2019t understand, there\u2019s something happening out here. I need to be sure my wife is okay,\u201d I said. I pushed past him before he could object and started shouting Cheryl\u2019s name. \n\nMy heart was pounding as I reached the first operating room and burst in without authorization. As much as I was expecting the nightmare to get worse, it was still uncanny to see this group of surgeons now seemingly unable to make any decision at all as their patient was bleeding out before my eyes. \n\nI turned back toward the orderly that was not affected and asked, \u201cDo you have any idea what this might be?\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Never seen anything like it,\u201d he admitted as he ran to a red phone on the wall to try and call for help. \n\nI moved to the next room but found it locked. On the other side I could see my Cheryl, just being put under anesthesia. \n\nThe surgeons started to gather their instruments and I shouted to try and get their attention. Another power surge occurred and I closed my eyes, scared I would be next. \n\nI could feel my head vibrating as I turned toward the orderly and asked if he had made contact with anyone. But he was on the floor, shaking violently. I reached for the phone and tried to dial, only to find that white noise was coming from the receiver. \n\nI stumbled back to the OR that Cheryl was in and shouted hysterically. The surgeons had just begun to cut into her chest when this strange affliction hit them. They were frozen in place with my wife\u2019s chest open, blood pouring out non stop as I heard the machine reach a flatline. \n\nI slammed on the door in desperation, not wanting to lose her. But it was pointless. The decision had been made for me. \n\nI collapsed in a heap of tears, shaking as I tried to understand what was happening. Was this a virus? A terrorist attack? I had no clue. \n\nThen beyond the hospital walls I heard car alarms. The sound of screeching tires. \n\nI managed to pick myself up and move toward a window to see what was happening. \n\n18 wheelers careening out of control. I even saw a helicopter falling from the sky. It burst into flame in the hospital parking lot as I realized that whatever had happened here, was now suddenly spreading. \n\nI stood there a moment longer, watching the destruction play out. Then the power went out again and I lost consciousness. My own free will taken from me. \n\nWhen I woke up, a day had passed. The news reported nothing about the strange event. It was as if it had never happened and the deaths and destruction were ignored. \n\nExcept I know that my wife died on the operating table. \n\nThat can\u2019t be erased. I don\u2019t know what strange event happened here but it scares me to death it might happen again. The loss of will, spreading and destroying more lives. \n\nWhat if soon we have no free will at all?\n\nI can\u2019t think of anything more terrifying.",

The term was created in 1883 by the neurologist William Alexander Hammond, who defined it as: 'a form of insanity characterised by an inertness, torpor, or paralysis of the will'.\n\nAboulomania - Wikipedia",

I was in hospital, a mental ward that was quite disruptive (to put it politely), and I remember hiding in a random room nobody was in with the lights off, and I was absolutely stuck at that point. I was there for hours. I don't even know how I got out. But \"pathological indecisiveness\" really seems to describe it to a T.",

    "postText": "My neighbor, Henry Johnson, would be out of town for two weeks. His wife had just left him, and he needed to clear his head. So he asked me to house sit. As a broke college student, I said yes.\n\nThe housesitting duties included taking care of the Johnsons\u2019 parrot\u2014a 17-year-old African Grey named Snickers. I didn\u2019t know much about birds, but he\u2019d left me detailed instructions on how to take care of her.\n\nThe first night of my job, I decided to stay for a few hours. I needed to get a problem set done, and the Johnsons\u2019 large, empty house was the perfect study place. After feeding Snickers and giving her water, I got set up on the couch.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t long before she interrupted me.\n\n**\u201cSTOP!\u201d**\n\nI whipped around. Snickers was standing on her perch, staring at me with one gray eye. **\u201cSTOP! STOP!\u201d** she repeated.\n\nRolling my eyes, I went back to the problem set. Differential equations. Why did I decide to major in engineering, again? ! tapped my pencil against the page. *Maybe it\u2019s time for another snack break.*\n\n**\u201cSTOP, OH GOD, STOP.\u201d**\n\nSnickers was bouncing from one perch to the other, bobbing her head, as carefree as could be. But the way she said that sent shivers down my spine. She was clearly imitating someone in distress. *Probably just repeating from a movie,* I told myself.\n\nBut I was so, so wrong.\n\n**\u201cSTOP, OH GOD, STOP. HENRY, STOP.\u201d**\n\nHenry.\n\nThat was his name. Henry Johnson.\n\nI turned and stared at the parrot. She stared back at me and whistled a few times. And them she continued.\n\n**\u201cSTOP OH GOD STOP HENRY STOP OH GOD\u201d**\n\nMy blood turned to ice. I stared at the parrot, my heart hammering in my chest. *What, exactly, happened here? What is she repeating?*\n\nI decided to call my parents. But they didn\u2019t seem to share my level of concern. \u201cYour Aunt Sheila had a parrot,\u201d my dad said. \u201cThat thing would pick up all kinds of crazy words. Movies, phone conversations\u2026 it\u2019d scream, say the f-word, everything. I wouldn\u2019t worry, Abbi. Especially with Raquel leaving him and all\u2026 they probably had some huge fights the parrot picked up on. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it got worse.\u201d\n\nAnd he was right. Over the course of the next hour, Snickers continued to repeat \u201cstop\u201d and \u201cHenry,\u201d but also said a variety of other things, from curses to pleasantries to movie quotes. **\u201cFUCK YOU.\u201d \u201cI\u2019LL BE BACK.\u201d \u201cHOW ARE YOU TODAY?\u201d \u201cCOMMENT ALLEZ-VOUS?\u201d**\n\nFinally, around ten o\u2019clock, I started getting ready to leave. Threw my notebook in my backpack, switched off the lights, and headed for the door. \u201cGoodbye Snickers,\u201d I called out into the darkness. Then I reached for the doorknob\u2014\n\n**\u201cPUT THE KNIFE DOWN.\u201d**\n\nI froze in my tracks.\n\nI couldn\u2019t see Snickers anymore. But I could hear her, rustling about in her cage. Talons clacking against the metal rails, feathers flapping in the silence. *Maybe she\u2019s just quoting another movie. Maybe she\u2019s\u2014*\n\n**\u201cPUT THE KNIFE DOWN HENRY,\u201d** the bird repeated.\n\nMy heart dropped.\n\n**\u201cSTOP OH GOD STOP OH GOD.\u201d**\n\nSnickers was agitated. I could hear her feathers hitting the metal rails of her cage as she flapped her wings. *Thunk\u2014*she hopped back and forth, perch to perch, as she clicked her beak erratically.\n\n**\u201cSTOP OH GOD STOP.\u201d**\n\nI stood there for a long time. Seconds stretched into minutes. But she didn\u2019t say anything more. Just clicked and whistled and flapped around in her cage.\n\nI flicked the lights back on, dropped my backpack on the floor, and made a beeline for the Johnsons\u2019 bedroom.\n\nHenry was very clear with his instructions. I wasn\u2019t supposed to enter any of the bedrooms or the basement. I was supposed to stay on the main level, no matter what.\n\nBut I climbed the stairs anyway. After looking around, I found their bedroom. It was neat and tidy, the burgundy bedspread laying smoothly over the mattress. I walked around, my heart hammering, hoping what I was imagining wasn\u2019t true.\n\nBut it was.\n\nBecause in their closet, I found a small box. A small box containing Raquel Johnson\u2019s wallet\u2026 and drivers license.\n\nI made my way back down the stairs, my legs shaking. Snickers looked at me curiously from her cage. I turned out the lights, locked the door, and hurried down the sidewalk. *As soon as I get home, I\u2019m calling the cops. As soon as I\u2014*\n\n*Ping.*\n\nI pulled out my phone to see a text.\n\nFrom Henry Johnson.\n\n**I asked you not to enter the bedroom.**\n\nI whipped around. But the dark sidewalk extended behind me, totally empty. *How did he\u2026 Oh. A camera. Of course.* I broke into a run towards my parents\u2019 house, at the corner. *Almost there\u2014*\n\n*Ping.*\n\n**I know what you saw.**\n\nI sprinted harder, faster. My feet slapped against the pavement. *Almost there\u2014*\n\n*Ping.*\n\nI didn\u2019t pull out my phone. Didn\u2019t stop until I was locked safely in my parents\u2019 house. Then, finally, I read the text that he sent.\n\n**If you tell anyone else, you will pay.**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI didn\u2019t listen. I called the police. And after a thorough search of his house, they found something horrible.\n\nRaquel\u2019s body, in the freezer in the basement.\n\nHenry was trying to flee town, but get a head start by making it look like he was just going on vacation. So he hired me to housesit. I don\u2019t think he realized Snickers might repeat what she heard that night.\n\nAnd sometimes, I wonder, if Snickers knew more than she let on. Because, apparently, she was Raquel\u2019s pet. From before they were even married.\n\nMaybe she wasn\u2019t mindlessly repeating.\n\nMaybe she was trying to get justice for Raquel.",

Not only are their living costs expensive, but they are a heavy time investment as well. \n\nThey are very social birds that you can't leave alone for extended periods of time and need a large amount of mental stimulation/affection/general attention daily in order to be healthy. \n\nAnd this is a lifetime commitment, African greys typically live anywhere from 45 to 75 years.",

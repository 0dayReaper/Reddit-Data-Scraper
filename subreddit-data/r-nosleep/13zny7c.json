John has always had some crazy ideas but that just sounded like a bad idea.\n\n\u201cYeah man, it would be neat to say we did it.\u201d \n\nDakota chimed in. \u201cIt sounds scary.\u201d I agreed.\n\nIan spoke up. \u201cI guess I\u2019d give it a try.\u201d\n\nIn theory, it  wouldn\u2019t be hard to pull off. I\u2019m sure a park ranger wouldn\u2019t approve but they wouldn\u2019t catch us either. They always check in with the campers before they go back to the ranger station where they sit around in case of emergencies. But it sounds way too scary. \n\nThe four of us have been camping at this state park since we were teenagers. We have a lot of great and funny stories over the years. I\u2019ve been hiking these trails and swimming since I was a kid. They got plenty of trails but the one they want to hike is the most popular. We try to do this every couple of months.\n\n\u201cUnless you\u2019re scared. I guess you could sit at the site while the big dogs have an adventure.\u201d \n\n\u201cShut up, John.\u201d \n\nWe spent the afternoon prepping and getting ready to cook the fish and the sun was starting to set. \n\nIan set down his drink. \u201cSo we gonna do this?\u201d They all were nodding along at this point. I didn\u2019t want to be alone either so I agreed to go.\n\nWe waited as the park ranger stopped by everyone\u2019s tent and told us to be safe and where the station is if we need a ranger for anything. It\u2019s the time of year where snakes are in the park and we\u2019re a whiles away from a hospital. \n\nWe put out the fire and made our way to a small trail that would take us to the main parking lot. We all grabbed flashlights and I went in my glove box and grabbed my 9mm. \n\nWe didn\u2019t speak at all hardly until we got to the parking area before turning off our flashlights. We made sure no rangers were in the area and we snuck off to the trail. \n\nWe eventually turned our flashlights back on and began up the trail. We talked pretty quietly for a while. It wasn\u2019t going to be a long walk, maybe two miles.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to describe how eerie it felt to me during the walk. Noises seem louder. It\u2019s like the calm and soothing river now sounds like it\u2019s screaming at me. The beautiful scenery was a void and made me feel small and helpless. There wasn\u2019t going to be any fellow hikers, just us. No help if needed.\n\nDakota told us a story his grandfather told him as a child about a witch that roamed the hills. People would claim she would hunt people down and eat them or sacrifice them. \n\nThey all thought it was funny, but I didn\u2019t. I swear I was hearing twigs snapping and seeing shadows move through darkness. Even the trees looked more crooked. \n\nWe made it to the waterfall and made small talk. We all took a picture on my phone and began walking back down the trail. The guys acted like I was crazy for being so scared. I felt more confident, everything was going fine. It felt like. Conquering fear. \n\nThe walk back started feeling more at ease until a few times our flashlights all went out at the same time. We were able to tinker with them and get them going again. I felt my stomach drop when I seen some flashlights coming on the other side of the trail. \n\nThey definitely seen ours too. We figured maybe it was park rangers who got curious and we\u2019d have to talk our way out of not being banished. The closer we got, it wasn\u2019t rangers.\n\nIt was kids. Probably about thirteen or so. They gave us a quick glance and Dakota tried to talk to them.\n\n\u201cHey kids, where\u2019s your parents? Wouldn\u2019t want them to worry. The walk is a little spooky.\u201d I had every intention of going to a ranger station and telling them. We weren\u2019t far from the parking lot.\n\nThey just kept walking though. John was hollering for them to stop but they didn\u2019t even look back at us. \n\nIan was shivering and whispered to me. \u201cI think those kids had black eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike pure black.\u201d \n\nAbout that time I heard foot prints stomping towards us. By the time I turned around the knocked down John. He began screaming.\n\nDakota tried pulling a kid off of John. One of them punched Dakota so hard he flew up and hit a tree. He wasn\u2019t moving.\n\nI pulled out my pistol and pointed at the kids. \u201cGet off him!\u201d One walked towards me. I shot in the ground once. He didn\u2019t even flinch. He started getting taller. Whatever that thing was had to be about seven feet tall. I shot at it. It didn\u2019t phase it. \n\nIan grabbed my arm and told me to run. I looked back at John and one of those things was swallowing him whole. It was like a snake slowly covering over another. \n\nWe ran as fast as we could. \u201cWhat about Dakota.\u201d\n\n\u201cMan, we gotta get ourselves help first.\u201d He tripped. I tried to stop but another one of those things grabbed him and began tugging him away. I fired twice more and missed. \n\nI was hoping the gunshots would at least alarm a ranger something was happening. One of those things was right behind me.\n\nI fell. I don\u2019t remember much of it either. But I remember hitting some thorny bushes and my head hitting a rock before falling in water.\n\nI woke up in my tent, it was morning. I scrambled to figure out what was going on until I heard voices outside the tent. It was the guys.\n\nThey were all sitting out by the fire eating some breakfast. I crawled out and sat on my chair. \n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make sense?\u201d\n\nJohn gave me a smile. \u201cYeah man, you drank a bunch of whiskey last night and had too many shrooms. You conked out pretty early.\u201d \n\nMy clothes weren\u2019t damp. I walked to my truck and checked the magazine in my pistol, it was full. It wasn\u2019t making any sense.\n\nI drank some coffee and looked through my photos. I found the selfie we took at the waterfall. I began staring at got nervous. It looked like an old woman standing above the waterfall , somewhat hidden. I heard all the guys chuckling.\n\nI look up and their eyes are pitch black. They all stood up. Ian smiled and his voice sounded distorted. \n\n\u201cIf you want to save your friends, come to the waterfall tonight.\u201d \n\nThey walked to the shallow stream next to our site and went under. They didn\u2019t come back up.\n\nI\u2019m really scared right now. I\u2019m going to head up there tonight. I\u2019ll update you as I can",

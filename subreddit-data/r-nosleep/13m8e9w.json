    "postText": "I don't know how a single person can clean up three corpses' worth of blood and intestines off a carpeted floor within only a couple hours. That's probably not a skill many humans have. Frankie Preston managed, though. Then again, he's not exactly human so maybe it doesn't count.\n\nWhen I joined him in the living room, he was wiping some thin specks of blood off the wall; the last trace of the carnage that had marred the space not too long ago. Everything else was spotless. He turned and threw me a smile. \"Sun's out.\"\n\n\"What did you do with the bodies?\"\n\n\"You don't want to know.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't have asked if I didn't.\"\n\n\"I sold the last guy. Keeping these three in my freezer until I can do it with them, too.\"\n\n\"Sold them for what?\"\n\n\"Money.\"\n\n\"I meant to whom and for what purpose.\"\n\n\"The internet is a funny place. The last buyer was a gentleman in his forties. Looked put-together but had an itchy vibe about him\u2026 maybe it was for fetish-y reasons. I don't like to think about it too much, it bums me out. But oh well.\"\n\n\"Most people would have moral reservations against that sort of transaction,\" I remarked.\n\n\"I just told you that it bums me out.\"\n\n\"Either way, we'll have to find a long term solution to this. FunFlair knows where you live and that you're not going to come quietly. Looks like they're gonna keep sending more people. You're not safe here,\" I explained, pulling him over to sit on the couch with me. \n\n\"You're right. I should stay at a hotel for a while. When you come to visit, we can pretend like we're on vacation.\"\n\n\"I'm serious. You have a whole collective of humans out to kill you. You need to come up with a way for us to deal with them.\" \n\n\"I'll think of something,\" he promised.\n\nWe spent the rest of the night watching cartoons and ended up falling asleep on the couch together. At least I did. It was nice to lean on someone and just *unwind*. Especially since I felt like the combined weight of the three dead strangers was pressing down on my head. When I woke up, the TV was off. The sky outside had brightened merely a bit, the morning sun rising but still out of sight. It had to have been around six. I was lying on top of Frankie, one hand in his hair and my face nestled in the folds of his sweater\u2014this act that humans call cuddling. It was pleasant, so much so that I wanted to prolong it. Frankie would have to get up at some point, but in the meantime, I'd wait, resting in warm tranquility.\n\nUntil I noticed that something was off. He was somehow *stiller* than me, almost doll-like. His chest was neither rising or falling. I pressed my ear up against him. Closer. I couldn't hear anything. Normally, you can hear the inside of a person's body. There's always something going on in their stomach, a little gurgle or whatever, and there will always be a heartbeat. That steady, rhythmic pounding that most every living being seems to have within them at all times. A chill ran down my spine when I realized that Frank Preston had none. He was completely and utterly silent inside. \n\nI knew he was awake when the sound of a gum popping snapped me out of my thoughts. I flinched, the movement too instinctive for me to control. For a frightful split second, the mere blink of an eye, horrible images flashed before my inner eye. I felt like I had discovered something I shouldn't have, something I was about to regret finding out. I pictured Frank flinging me down, forcing me to widen my mouth, to unleash my other limbs and\u2014\n\n\"Good morning,\" he said, his voice softer than cotton.\n\n\"Hi,\" I mumbled.\n\n\"Is everything okay?\"\n\n\"Are you dangerous?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then it's all good.\"\n\n\"Alright. Now get off of me, I need to go make money.\"\n\nPer my request, he dropped me off at Nettie's place before making his way to the diner. He told me to call him later, and I promised I would. I was a little uneasy letting him go like that, but there was hardly anything I could do. For the time being, I chased these thoughts from my mind and raised my hand to ring the doorbell. It took Nettie a minute to open, but merely judging from her countenance, her mood seemed to be far alleviated. The warmth had returned to her eyes, and her hair was free of paint. I barely had the time to say hello to her before she dragged me inside, sat me down and started force-feeding me toast.\n\n\u201cI didn't come for breakfast,\u201d I began between bites. \"You were very sad yesterday.\"\n\n\"I was,\" she replied, twirling one of her curls around her finger as she regarded me in uncertainty. \"I'm sorry, I\u2026 didn't want you to see me like that.\"\n\n\"Why not? I would have been there for you. I wanted to comfort you, too. I don't understand why you didn't let me.\"\n\n\"Evangeline, you're\u2026 something else. There are some things you wouldn't get, and I don't always have the nerve to explain them to you.\" As soon as those words had left her mouth, she snapped it shut, her eyes widening. \"Okay, that came out wrong\u2014\"\n\nI set my plate aside. \"I know I was asking too many questions. I didn't intend to be a bother, and I don't need to understand everything; what I really wanted was to find a way for you to feel better. I'm sorry if I'm being overbearing right now, but I'm confused as to why you preferred the company of my roommate\u2014whom you barely know\u2014over mine.\"\n\nNettie pinched the bridge of her nose. \"Kit is\u2026 not *like* you. Kit knows what it's like when you're simply sad. Sometimes, you don't need a *better way* or a solution for that, you just want to cry in peace with a friend to hold you. Because there's not always something you can do to remedy that sadness, you just want to sit and wait it out.\"\n\n\u201cYes, but why?\u201d\n\n\u201cHoney, that\u2019s just how it is sometimes. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t appreciate your approach, and it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love you. Okay?\u201d\n\nI held her gaze. \u201cYeah. I think I get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad. Do you wanna go for a walk?\u201d\n\nI told her yes so we quickly slipped our jackets on and made our way out the door. It was a nice morning, the incoming sunlight promising a warmer, pleasant noon. \u201cYou know,\u201d Nettie began, shoving her hands into her pockets, \u201cI might\u2019ve also sent you away because I kinda don\u2019t want you to ever see me freak out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind that.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I would. Think about it. Was there ever a time when I did *not* keep it together in front of you?\u201d\n\nI stared up at the brightening sky for a moment before answering. \u201cNot really.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want it to stay that way. For you, at least. I know I\u2019m not your mom or anything, but sometimes, that\u2019s how I feel. And I like that feeling.\" She reached over to pinch my cheek. \"I like being the one who knows best.\"\n\n\"Doesn't that become draining at some point? I don't want you to feel like you have to put on some sort of facade to be around me.\"\n\n\"Sure it does. And I know that. But see, five years ago, I was your sole caretaker. I still want to be that. I want to always be there to tell you that there's no reason to be confused or afraid. And going to work, dealing with other people on a day-to-day basis, talking to them even if they're being assholes; that's just something that's expected of you. Of anyone! Now, if you see me cry about something as trivial as that\u2026 then what does that say about the life you're going to have here!\" She whipped her hair back, her steps having turned into barely tempered strides. \"I want your human experience to be better than that.\"\n\n\"I've always considered frustration to be a part of it, though. My human experience overall remains more than agreeable despite that,\" I assured her. \n\nNettie let go of a light breath, fixing me with hopeful eyes. \"Really?\"\n\n\"Really. And I'd appreciate it if you were to share your grievances with me in the future. But even so, I'll try to be less annoying about it, I promise.\"\n\nShe smiled and pulled me into a side-hug. \"And you're happy here, even though things haven't been going smoothly?\"\n\n\"Hey, you had a bad day at a job you enjoy; I'm having a bad couple weeks on a planet I'm fond of. I won't lie, there's been a lot of\u2026 uh, negativity? In my head? lately, but this is still the best existence I can realistically imagine for myself.\"\n\nMy savior human dropped her arm to my side, grabbing my hand. \"I'm so glad that's your takeaway.\"\n\nWe had come quite a long way from where we'd started. Houses having become fewer and further between and the streets widening into open, paved spaces, we realized we'd wandered off to the northern outskirts of town. Those green pointy trees Nettie says are pines were standing tall in the distance, swaying in the wind. Not far ahead of us, I spotted a large, rugged structure I instantly recognized. Tugging on Nettie's arm, I indicated the building with a nod of my head. \"See that warehouse? Elijah Carter and I were in there recently.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"We ran into trouble, I suppose. Something strange happened, but it wasn't too bad. It paid well.\"\n\n\"Uh, what?\"\n\nI swallowed. \"It's\u2026 a long story. And kind of complicated. I guess Kit would say it's trippy? I'll tell you later, at any rate. Would you mind if I took a quick look?\"\n\nNettie sighed, glancing back the way we'd come before dropping her shoulders and giving me a small smile. \"Why not.\"\n\nWe crossed the large, gray plain of the parking lot, gravel crunching beneath our feet. With every step we took, the building appeared to grow larger until it eventually stood tall before us, dwarfing my savior human and me. Nettie looked up at it with narrowed eyes. \"I don't know if it's just because of how big it is or because I know it's been empty for so long, but this place makes me feel weird,\" she muttered.\n\n\"It does that.\" I led her around the side to the large windows, hoping to find out whether the red container was still inside. However, when I rose to the tips of my toes to peer in through the sturdy glass panes, all I could see was white. The view had been blocked by some larger object pushed in front of them from the inside. I took a step back, frowning pensively. \"This is new.\"\n\n\"Did you see there's a fire escape?\" Nettie suddenly spoke up, having walked over to the next corner and pointing at something obstructed behind it. \"If you wanna see inside, we could try that.\" \n\nI hurriedly came up beside her to find that there was, indeed, a metal outside staircase at the back of the building. I leapt towards it, only for Nettie to hold me back. \"Careful! It's not exactly shiny and new anymore!\" Not releasing my arm, she began to lead me up the steps. The steel gratings creaked ominously beneath our shoes, and I found myself hesitant to put my full weight onto them. Creeping further and further up, we finally arrived at the small, topmost platform. A red door barred us from whatever lay beyond it. If I remembered correctly, it would technically lead to the balustrade that had lined the inaccessible upper story of the warehouse. After exchanging quick glances with Nettie and receiving a shrug, I reached out to gently push open the door.\n\nI hadn't expected it to give way, but against all odds, it did. A groan escaped its hinges when I leaned against it. The fact that it was unlocked either meant that the masked person had overlooked it in their safety procedures or that the red container wasn't inside the building anymore altogether. \"We should have really tried the front door first,\" I told Nettie, who was peeking in over my shoulder. To my surprise, she shushed me. Her eyes had blown wide, her lips parting for her mouth to form a silent, fearful little \"o\". I followed her gaze through the crack in the doorway. \n\nThe container was, in fact, gone. But the hall was not empty. \n\nI've found that sometimes, it takes me a moment to process what I'm seeing. I believe this to be a human trait, since I never experienced much disconnect between my senses and mind back in my old life. Perhaps my fall to earth has changed me in more ways than I can understand, or maybe a part of me had recalled the illusions I'd experienced during my previous stay at the warehouse. Either way, the first thing I felt upon looking down at the ground level of the warehouse was disbelief. I genuinely did not trust my eyes.\n\nThe floor was carpeted in dark red. A pool of blood had collected right in the center, in the same spot where the container used to be. The amount of it was shocking enough in itself. The surface of the puddle had a wet gleam to it, indicating freshness. Wading through the spilled bodily fluids was a single person. They were wearing a rain poncho and gummy shoes, holding onto a large black trash bag as they tiptoed through the rippling crimson stain. There was something lying on the ground in the middle, something round I couldn't quite make out from where we were standing. The person bent down to grab it, lifting it up before dropping it into their bag. I heard Nettie gag beside me. \n\n\"Eva,\" she whispered. \"We need to go. Now.\"\n\nThat's when it hit me. The object was a human head. I didn't question her. \n\nShe grabbed me by the shoulder, dragging me away from the door, only for the heavy thing to let out a metallic screech when the pressure I'd put on it suddenly disappeared. The person down in the hall spun around at the noise, and despite the distance that separated us and the mask that covered their face, I could somehow *tell* that they'd seen me. Nettie was already on the first step down, her grip on my shoulder bordering on forceful, but I couldn't move. I couldn't even breathe. As though paralyzed with shock, I held the person's gaze as the slim crack in the doorway closed. \n\nAnd then, everything got dark and I heard Nettie scream.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13dr5g0/help_im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[2: deadbeat roommate](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13eovqy/im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_also_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[3: creepy crush](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13fnc4u/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_everyone/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[4: relocation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13gjpwd/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_does_anybody/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[5: beach concert](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13heih5/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[6: First date](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ib2es/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_my_first/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[7: Temp work](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ja7jx/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_temp_work/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[8: roommate talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13k8088/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_a_talk_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[9: a dismal worldview](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13l69a9/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_the_world/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[11: staircase dimension](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13o0npw/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_we_visited_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

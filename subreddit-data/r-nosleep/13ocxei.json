    "postText": "At first they thought it was schizophrenia.\n\nMy parents took me to several different medical facilities to try and treat it, but never to any effect. Most professionals agreed that I lacked many symptoms and signs of schizophrenia in a female child, which is what I was when the voices first appeared. MRI tests came back showing my brain was completely ordinary.\n\nStill, I struggled with hearing voices throughout my childhood and into my adulthood. The location was the most important factor in how difficult dealing with them was. Places where more people died, especially hospitals, was my equivalent to walking into an ongoing construction site. Dozens of overlapping, unintelligible sentences, screams, cries.\n\nOther areas weren\u2019t as bad. Spots on the edge of town, my home in the suburbs, really any place that hasn\u2019t been consistently populated for long, those were much easier to handle.\n\nYou see, not everyone that dies comes back as a ghost. Some of the old myths about ghosts are true, like the fact that only people with some kind of unfinished business remain behind. They don\u2019t necessarily have to have negative reasons like revenge. Some ghosts remain to look after a loved one or to see the immediate aftermath of their life choices.\n\nAnother myth is that ghosts are tied to this world forever. It\u2019s not true. Most fade away within a decade. All those stories you hear about some haunted doll from the Victorian Era or a tortured peasant from the Dark Ages are false. Maybe they were true to begin with but they don\u2019t last.\n\nHow do I know all this?\n\nI\u2019ve been talking to ghosts for over half my life at this point, you don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t tried to figure out how it all works?\n\nI\u2019ve made friends with some of the spirits. I\u2019ve been heartbroken when some of their voices started getting quieter and quieter until they faded away.\n\nI used to know an old lady who lived in my house before I did. Her and I would talk all the time. She helped me through more than a few of my cringier middle school crushes that went sour. All she wanted to stay for was to see who would inhabit her beloved home after her death.\n\nI grew to love her very much, but I don\u2019t talk to all of them. In fact, I don\u2019t talk to most of them. The spirits don\u2019t know I can hear them until I let them know I can, and I found out early on that I don\u2019t want any of them following me around. It\u2019s really hard to think when there\u2019s a couple dozen disembodied voices around you at all times.\n\nThat\u2019s why when I found out my parents were going to move to a big city after I graduated, I told them I wasn\u2019t going with. They knew about the ghosts but never really believed me. Regardless, I had enough money saved from my part-time high school job that I could afford to move to a small town on the edge of the Colorado Rockies.\n\nI\u2019ve lived in this small town for three years now and it\u2019s been the best three years of my life.\n\nWhy?\n\nNo ghosts.\n\nI haven\u2019t heard a single voice since I moved here. The small house I rent is near some hiking paths on the outskirts and even when I go into town, the only voices I hear are those of the living. I\u2019m sure some people that die here do turn into ghosts, but clearly not enough of them to notice or to bother me. Then again I suppose it\u2019s also possible I just don\u2019t go out often enough. If you had my condition, you\u2019d probably develop a similar light case of agoraphobia.\n\nI first moved out here in 2020 and managed to land an online job because of world events I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with. I\u2019ve been able to keep the job so that I can work from home and spend less time around the dead. Really the only time I leave my home is to go shopping once a week or to go on a hike for a little fresh air and some exercise.\n\nIt was on a hike a few weeks ago that I broke my streak of not communing with the no-longer-living.\n\nI was on one of my routine hikes through the trail behind my house. The air was particularly sharp in the Spring mist. This year\u2019s Winter had lasted from October to late March so it was incredible to finally get back out on the trails without having to be bundled up like a mummy or drudge through thick layers of snowfall.\n\nThe trail was fairly devoid of people, more so than usual. Luckily none of them were particularly chatty either which meant that I was able to keep my earbuds in throughout the hike. But my music was interrupted by the horrific wails of a woman somewhere in the wilderness.\n\n*HELP ME!* She screamed. *DEAR GOD, PLEASE!!*\n\nOver and over again I heard her crying and shrieking for help. I rushed towards the origin of the voice. Branches snapped back and stung at my arms and face, but the urgency kept me going at full velocity.\n\nIt had been so long since the last time I\u2019d heard a ghost that not once did I consider the possibility that the voice was not that of the living.\n\nI was so invested in the emergency that when I broke into the clearing of the blue spruces the sight of the body alone nearly knocked me off my feet. The screaming of the spirit was drowned out by my own shrill screeching.\n\nThe corpse was torn apart. The bloody flesh was strewn about over the mountain rocks. The body was face down but besides that I could not tell much else from the carnage.\n\nOn instinct, I ran. I ran down the trail looking around constantly in fear of bears or wolves or anything which would cause me to end up like that woman. I saw no one else on the path. No one else the entire long trip back to my home.\n\nInto the house, deadbolt locked, and as soon as my heartrate had slowed I pulled out my phone to call the police.\n\nMy nerves refused to steady. My hands trembled as I made myself a cup of tea. My breaths felt forced from my chest. In and out and in and out with so much pressure that I collapsed onto my sofa.\n\nAs I stared up at my ceiling, as the kettle whistled somewhere far away, I could only visualize the redness. I could only see the gore. The horrific stench of decomposition and the haunting screeches of a woman\u2019s last moments.\n\nI got no work done for the next two days. The experience was still too fresh to allow me to think clearly of anything else. On the third day, I attempted in vain to hype myself up for work. I told myself I had to meet my quota so that I wouldn\u2019t lose my job.\n\nI sat down in my home office with another cup of tea. The millionth one of the day and one which did nothing to calm the visions. All the tea did was make my visions more erratic and my bathroom breaks more frequent.\n\nI booted up my laptop and opened a new window for my browser. Not long into my work I got the sudden urge to look up the local news. I was afraid of what I might find, but I was more afraid that without closure, I would never be better.\n\nIt was the first thing on the online newsletter.\n\n**Local Woman Brutalized by Wildlife on Popular Hiking Trail**\n\n**Authorities Warn Citizens to Keep Clear Until Safe**\n\nI attempted to process the information but was interrupted by a voice from behind me. A voice which made me jump and spill my drink across the rug.\n\nThat\u2019s not what happened.\n\nThose were the words spoken by the voice. Then they were followed by more.\n\n*So you* **can** *hear me.*\n\nI stayed still for a moment. I watched the tea soak into my carpet. The damp stain spread over the rug just as the blood had on the mountain sand.\n\n\u201cI can,\u201d I said. I rotated my office chair to where I assumed the voice was standing. \u201cBut I can\u2019t see you.\u201d\n\n*You saw me at one point. Three days ago. You heard my calls for help.*\n\nI talked with her for a while. I explained to her, like I had always used to do for other ghosts, the extent of my communication.\n\nHearing yes.\n\nSeeing no.\n\nHelping never.\n\n*What do you mean you won\u2019t help me?* She asked, horrified.\n\n\u201cHow can I? I\u2019m just some person, not a vigilante.\u201d\n\n*You\u2019re the only one that can help me because you\u2019re the only one who can hear me.*\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even remember who killed you. You just said they got you when you were turned around.\u201d\n\nFor a while it was silent. I wondered if she had left until she continued by saying,\n\n*I don\u2019t remember it all. It\u2019s fuzzy, yes, but I know I saw a person. It had to be one of the people I saw on the trail.*\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t much narrow it down,\u201d I stammered, rather more shortly than I had meant to.\n\nI heard a faint sobbing which immediately made me feel terrible.\n\n*Please. Please help me. You\u2019re all I have.*\n\nSo now I guess I\u2019m a detective. Now it\u2019s up to me to figure it out. I\u2019ll update you guys when I can, if I can.",

We have a terrible relationship that none want to attend therapy for, so they're ready to go to their Graves with that hate and resentment and jealousy. But what also makes them so infuriating is that they're malicious narcissists and I could 1000% see them doing an open casket funeral, give made up eulogies, bring eye drops so that they can pretend to cry at the \"right\" moments, and invite every single person who I might have come in contact with in my life. My therapist says I should make a living will because I don't want them to know I've died or get access to my body once I'm done using it. \n\nPeople tend to idolize the dead, no matter what they were like when they were alive. I stopped doing that years ago. Sometimes people are dicks in life and they're dicks in death too. \n\nOn one hand, I'd honestly think that nobody would want my body and that nobody would care, but on the other hand, I have never known my family to not use every single opportunity to gain sympathy or attention.",

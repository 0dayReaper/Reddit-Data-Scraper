    "postText": "In hindsight, I should have listened to the kill-bill alarm bells in my head when eight-year-old Cassie announced she and her cabin mates were going to skip out on camp activities and play Operation instead. \n\nThough it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t have things on my mind. Seven counsellors had gone missing\u2014along with our head counsellor who was supposed to be taking care of us. \n\nIt started out fairly normal. I mean, one or two counselors wasn\u2019t bad, right? \n\nLily and Joey had been drowning in sexual tension for a while, so nobody was surprised when they sneaked into the woods for what I could only guess was the most uncomfortable sex ever. But then they didn\u2019t come back. \n\nTeddy and Yuri went to look for them, and then they too also disappeared. It was almost like a wild animal was lying in wait for another unsuspecting teenager to cross its path.   \n\nWith six of us left, I was definitely freaking out.\n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting summer camp to be like this. I did consider working in my local Sephora, but mom had a preference\u2014and whether I was eighteen years old or not, she was getting her way. So, it was goodbye civilization, and hello Canadian wilderness. \n\nThere were fifteen kids queued up in front of me for lunch, and I was having a hard time keeping that optimistic Camp Redwood smile.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help constantly counting how many hours it had been since the latest disappearance, Connor. \n\nHe was supposed to be helping with getting the emergency generator going, after the electricity sizzled out. \n\nThe boy was gone an hour later. This was happening fast. Whatever was going on with the counsellors was burning through all of us. Would it happen to me? \n\nI had seen so many TV shows and movies set in a summer camp where every camper and counsellor was doomed to die in the grossest way possible. Was that going to happen to us?\n\nI tightened my grip around the stupid ladle I had found myself stirring, a giant pot of chocolate syrup. Watching watery chocolate drip from the edge, I felt nauseous. Of all the summer camp\u2019s mom had to send me to, it had to be the one with vanishing counsellors and zero adult authority. Which meant we were the authority. Twelve teenagers who came to relax and babysit a bunch of little kids before college. \n\nWe had to put on brave faces and pretend everything was absolutely fine\u2014and we weren\u2019t all terrified out of our fucking minds. \n\nAt the corner of my eye, I glimpsed Harry offering piggybacks to a bunch of little kids, with one of the littles, Eleanor, wrapping her arms around his neck and squealing. \n\nFrom the look on the boy\u2019s face, he wanted to stop. It was hard to keep a fa\u00e7ade when reality was becoming harder and harder to bear. Abandoning his hat completely, Harry was dripping with sweat, trying to twist his lips into the Camp Redwood grin. But looking closer, as he galloped across the cabin with Eleanor holding on for dear life, the guy was ready to collapse. I didn\u2019t blame him. \n\nEntertaining the kids was supposed to be Teddy\u2019s assignment\u2014and he was who knows where. I had taken over lunch duties for Lily, who had joined the long list of the missing. \n\nHarry was supposed to be joining the search party for the missing councellors, but had ended up becoming the little\u2019s personal punching bag.  \n\nWhen I first met him, Harry Carlisle had been the kid who sat on the side-lines and offered sarcastic remarks and crude jokes. Now, he had been reduced to a playground ride the kids pretended didn\u2019t have an off switch. \n\nHe had enjoyed maybe the first two rides to raise morale,  but now I could see the strain in his eyes. \u201cOw!\u201d Harry winced when the little girl\u2019s fingers prodded at his eyes. \u201cHey! Eleanor, not my eyes!\u201d He was dangerously close to toppling over, though managed to catch his footing, ordering all of them off of his back. \u201cHorse Rides are over!\u201d He cupped his mouth, shouting across the cabin when a group of kids surrounded him with equally terrifying faces. Harry backed away and threw his hands up.  \u201cCome on, guys, my back isn\u2019t built for all of you!\u201d\n\n\u201cHorsey!\u201d The kids shouted back in a cacophony of giggles.\n\nIt was 10 against one.\n\nAgainst two, if I got involved. Which wasn\u2019t going to happen. There was no way I was putting effort into play-fighting a bunch of eight-year-olds. Harry shot me a hopeful look, though I pretended not to see, busying myself with slightly burned nuggets. \n\nRunning his fingers through thick strands of sandy colored hair, Harry pulled a face when a little girl, Phoebe, was brave enough to step forward. \n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Harry shook his head, squeezing the front of his counsellor shirt practically glued to him. The temperature still hadn\u2019t let up, and it was heading towards 8PM. Night-time, I thought dizzily. It was almost bedtime, and still no adults. \u201cI refuse to surrender,\u201d He told her. \u201cPhoebe, I am not joking around when I\u2019m saying my back is hurting. We\u2019ve been playing horsey\u2019s for two hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo!\u201d Harry couldn\u2019t yell or hiss, or swear at them. That was a big no-no with kids. \n\nHowever, I could see he was coming close to breaking that rule. \u201cBecause I\u2019m tired,\u201d he said through a Camp Redwood grin, which was quickly twitching into a grimace.  \n\nI think all of us had given up with the fake enthusiasm when our colleagues started to vanish. Now, we were just shells of our former happy selves. \u201cAnd\u2026 uh\u2026 did you know that if you ride a horsey at this time, the ghosts will come and get you?\u201d \n\nWhen a boy opened his mouth, his eyes widening with fright, Harry realized his mistake. \n\n\u201cI mean the nice ghosts! Yeah! The uh, the nice ghosts who haunt..I mean play in these woods? It\u2019s a well-known Camp Redwood legend that ghosts don\u2019t like horse rides. In fact,\u201d his lips curved into a devilish smile now he had several faces staring at him. The kids dropped onto the ground to listen, their hands clasped in their laps. This was the quietest they had been all day. I could understand though. Harry had taken the reins around the campfire telling ghost stories for three nights in a row, and the guy was a damn good storyteller.\n\nWith every eye on him, Harry lowered his voice into a whisper. \u201cDo you guys want to know what they do?\u201d\n\nThe kids nodded with wide eyes.\n\n\u201cThey sneak into unsuspecting cabin\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry.\u201d\n\nRowan\u2019s voice came from outside in a warning. The window was open, and the guy was standing watch to see if any counsellors came back.  Since the only adult had disappeared, he had been appointed leader\u2014and the guy was taking himself a little too seriously. \n\nHis warning was valid though. Sometimes Harry\u2019s ghost stories were a little too scary for little kids, who\u2019s Imaginations tended to run wild\u2014especially at night. Olive, my cabin-mate, had to give up her bed for a little girl who was convinced Harry\u2019s depiction of Slenderman, \u201cThe tree boy\u201d was going to sneak into her bed and turn her into an apple seed.\n\n\u201cDid I say sneak into cabin\u2019s? I meant dance around the woods\u2026\u201d Harry corrected himself. \u201cAnd they look for their next unsuspecting victim\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d\n\n\u201cFriend.\u201d Harry swallowed his words when a little boy\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cI mean they are looking for a friend! So, the point of my story is\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHorsey rides get us new friends?\u201d Phoebe wasn\u2019t buying it. I could tell from the slight arch of her brow and her widening smile.\n\nThe girl shook dark curls out of her face, smirking. I think it was her pleading eyes which won him over. Because, with a sigh which definitely wasn\u2019t joking around, the guy dropped onto his knees and practically spat at her to climb on his back\u2014and she did, plonking one sparkling shoe on top of the boy\u2019s spine with enough force to send him onto his stomach. I might have been imagining it, but since when were these littles so outlandishly spiteful? \n\nThe little girl was grinning. Not because she could ride her \u201chorsey\u201d but because Harry looked like he was going to either wring her neck, or wring his own. Mom had a \u201ctalk\u201d before I started here, and she made sure to tell me that if adult authority is nowhere to be seen, little kids will start to act out. \n\nI could definitely call it acting out, but I had spent all day with her several days earlier playing with dolls and having a teddy bear picnic when she admitted she didn\u2019t want to swim in the lake with the other kids. Phoebe had been shy and only spoke to me through her teddy bear, so what had changed? \n\nCould the lack of adults really be scaring the kids that much?\n\n\u201cMiss Josie?\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t paying attention, half noticing some kids had just helped themselves, piling chicken nuggets and cookies on plastic plates and hurrying to their seats like I couldn\u2019t see them. \n\nBlinking away brain fog, I found myself face to face with Eli, who was probably my favorite camper. \n\nYou\u2019re not supposed to have personal preferences when working with little kids, because your opinions could upset them. \n\nHowever, it was incredibly hard not to like Eli. \n\nHiding behind a mop of brown curls, the boy was one of the more vocal kids in the group. Eli said he wanted to be an inventor when he was older, and he wanted to make robots. The kid had asked me if I wanted to see his robot collection, but I was too busy with setting up camp activities. Standing in front of me and clutching his tray, the boy was frowning. \n\n\u201cJosie, I just saw some kids steal chicken nuggets.\u201d\n\nI shrugged, shovelling a large portion on his tray. \u201cWell, you can have some extra too.\u201d\n\nEli\u2019s smile wasn\u2019t as big as usual. \u201cWhere\u2019s Teddy?\u201d\n\nI pretended to be oblivious, hastily adding more nuggets to his tray as if I could keep his mouth shut with extra food. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back soon! Teddy is just playing in the woods.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nAt first, I thought I\u2019d heard the boy wrong. The kid wasn\u2019t looking at me, counting his nuggets as usual with the prongs of his plastic fork.\n\nI leaned forward with my best smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what was that, Eli?\u201d\n\nThe kid lifted his head with a wide grin. \u201cCan I borrow a knife, Josie?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you need a knife?\u201d\n\nLeaning forward, the boy shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s a squirrel caught in a trap,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to put it out of its misery, Miss Josie. It\u2019s in a lot of pain.\u201d\n\nThat was\u2026 dark.\n\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t give you a knife\u2026\u201d I trailed off, my gaze finding Harry and the growing line of kids awaiting a horse-ride. \u201cBut! How about you go and ask Harry for a piggy-back ride?\u201d I pointed to myself with a forced grin. \u201cI\u2019ll save the squirrel!\u201d And when the boy\u2019s eyes filled with tears and he shook his head, I reached out, grasped his hand, and squeezed it as tight as I could. \u201cEli, we don\u2019t need to do that, okay? I\u2019m sure the squirrel can be saved and I\u2019ll make sure to take it to the vet, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what if it doesn\u2019t need saving?\u201d\n\nI squeezed tighter. \u201cI\u2019ll save it, Eli. I promise.\u201d\n\nEli didn\u2019t look convinced, but he nodded with a grumble. \u201cOkay.\u201d He said, before twisting around and joining the other kids torturing Harry. Immediately, I left my station\u2014whether Rowan liked it or not\u2014and headed outside to look for this supposedly dying squirrel. That was something we didn\u2019t need. The sky was darkening when I made it into the woods, cotton candy clouds blurring through the thick canopy of trees. Eli said it was near the sign pointing towards the lake. Though I couldn\u2019t see anything. Odd. That thought retracted in my head, however, when I stepped forward, and a squelching sound cut through the silence of my own heavy breaths mixing with insect chitters and nightlife buzzing above me and beneath me. The wet sounding squelch twisted my gut, and when I stared down at the ground, I didn't know what I was expecting. \n\nA squashed squirrel, perhaps? In Eli\u2019s words, the poor thing had been on the edge of death. Though, when I was thinking about it, there were no animal traps around camp. That was basic health and safety. So, what the fuck was I looking at? The bottom of my shoe was caked in dried blood, but it was the thing which was stamped into the dirt which sent my heart into my throat. It looked like an eye. \n\nBut looking closer as I lowered myself to the ground, I glimpsed something metallic, something glistening around the pupil. I picked up a stick and prodded it, though the thing didn\u2019t move. It was definitely an eye\u2014the eye of some kind of animal, judging from the pigmentation and the color of the iris. \n\nBut it was the metallic pieces around the eye which was throwing me off. Part of a trap, maybe? It wouldn\u2019t be out of the realm of possibility that a poor critter had been ripped apart, and a wild bear had dropped its dinner near the camp\u2014and the metal encasing its eye was most likely pieces of trap.\n\nPeering closer, though, I glimpsed silver slithers in what appeared to be the destroyed nerve caked to my shoe. After scraping most of it off, I caught glistening pieces of blood stained metal catching the late-setting sun. This time, I pinched a piece between my forefinger and thumb. It didn\u2019t look like a bear-trap. The metal itself wasn\u2019t serrated or old. In fact, it was new. \n\nWhich begged the question: What was this thing? \n\nWhatever it was, it had started converting what looked like a critter\u2019s eye, before stopping. Was it a virus? When that thought slammed into me, I fell back with a hiss, swiping my hands on my shirt.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\nI almost jumped out of my skin, diving to my feet.\n\nCarmel was standing behind me, grasping what looked like her sixth or seventh coffee. The girl had been running to and from the coffee machine all day, and I had been silently counting how much caffeine she was consuming. Carmel had been a well put together and fairly popular girl when camp started. She immediately had everyone following her beck and call, all of the boy\u2019s (and girl\u2019s) following her around. \n\nCarmel wasn't straight. She made that clear on the bus to camp, announcing she wasn\u2019t interested in guy\u2019s, and that she had a girlfriend back home. Still though, the guy\u2019s still followed her because... well, she was pretty. \n\nCarmel was my bunk-mate and had woken me up on three separate occasions at 6am to go through the exact same hair and makeup routine. Now though, there was no sign of makeup or even that she had brushed her hair. \n\nInstead of its usual tidy blonde ponytail, Carmel\u2019s curls were tied into raggedy pigtails with ribbons I was sure she had stolen from a camper\u2019s doll. I think what was keeping her going was coffee. \n\nCarmel regarded me with too-wide eyes and a Camp Redwood smile we all knew was fake. She was grasping onto her coffee cup for dear life. \u201cJosie!\u201d she jumped when I jumped, which almost made me laugh. \u201cRowan\u2019s having an emergency meeting in his cabin,\u201d she said. \n\n\u201cSo, whatever you\u2019re doing can wait.\u201d\n\nHer gaze flicked to the ground. \u201cWhat\u2026 are you doing?\u201d\n\nFor a brief moment, I considered telling Carmel I may have found what looked like a virus which turned flesh and blood to metal\u2014before I remembered her reaction when a spider had crept into our cabin. \n\nWhatever this thing was, keeping it a secret for now was probably what was best. Making sure I was standing on the thing, I shrugged. \u201cI was looking for the others.\u201d\n\nCarmel cocked her head, before resting her coffee on the ground. \u201cIn the dirt?\u201d\n\n\u201cFootprints, Carmel.\u201d\n\nThe girl looked confused before shaking her head. \u201cOkay, whatever. Tell the others I\u2019ll be there in a sec, I just need to make sure the kids are okay. We\u2019re putting a movie on for them in the lunch hall, so that will hopefully distract them for maybe two hours.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cDid anyone find a phone?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot with signal!\u201d\n\n\u201cCarmel.\u201d I had to fight back the urge to yell at her to keep her voice down. Kids were curious, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we had some littles peeking into our conversation. \u201cYou\u2019re okay.\u201d I said softly. \n\n\u201cI mean, we\u2019re not okay, because yes, things are very.. screwed up right now, but we need to be\u2026 optimistic.\u201d I exhaled out a breath, searching for eyes in the dark. I tried to smile, tried to keep up that Camp Redwood fa\u00e7ade we were all held hostage by until the last day of camp (According to rule 5 in the Camp Redwood counsellor handbook, all counsellors must retain a smile and a positive attitude. If any counselor is caught making a frowny face, or spreading what we call \u201cunhappiness\u201d we will be forced to send the counselor home).\n\nAt this point, I didn\u2019t give a fuck\u2014but part of me didn\u2019t want to scare the little kids.\n\n\u201cNo, Josie.\u201d The girl grasped hold of my shoulders with a grin rivalling the joker. \u201cI am so sick of being told to keep smiling, because what is that doing? Three of my cabin-mates are missing! I\u2019m the only one left, and Rowan and co expect me to keep up this act? We are fucked!\" \n\nShe cupped her mouth. \u201cF. U. C. K. E. D. We have zero adults, an unexplainable loss of power every few hours which makes no sense in the middle of nowhere\u2014I mean what the fuck is out there which is sucking that much power, huh? There is no explanation! There should be an explanation. I should be able to think, \u201coh, yeah! That\u2019s why! But no. Things are happening, and I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re happening. Rowan is trying to force us to act like things are okay \u2014but in reality? He is shitting himself, Josie! We are ALL shitting ourselves!\u201d\n\nI took a step back, keeping hold of her hand. Carmel was trembling, her hands clammy and slimy entangled in mine. \u201cHe's just trying to keep the kids from freaking out.\"\n\nShe groaned, tears glistening in her eyes. \u201cOkay, yeah! I\u2019m blaming them because they keep acting like everything is okay\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything IS okay.\u201d I turned to her with what I hoped was a reassuring smile\u2014knowing damn well about the thing I\u2019d found in the dirt. If that thing could spread, it would have a field day in an enclosed space like a summer camp. \n\nI noticed my own hands which had been touching the thing making contact with Carmel, and dropped my hands, inwardly squirming. \n\nIf that thing was a virus, I was already fucked. \n\nMaybe Carmel too. \n\nIf it was fast acting, it could explain the counsellor disappearances. I was already putting together a plan in my head as we headed back to the main cabin. We had to put together a search party. Some of us would stay with the kids, while a small group would venture into the woods to try and look for traces of the missing. If I was right, we would find a horror scene in the woods, and yes, that would be the time to panic.\n\nIf I was wrong, however, there was still hope.\n\n\u201cAre we going to be okay?\u201d\n\nCarmel\u2019s voice sliced into my thoughts, and I took a moment to drink in the camp around us. \n\nUsually, when the sky was turning twilight, it would be bustling with campers and counselors toasting marshmallows on the fire and gathering around to fall asleep to Harry\u2019s ghost stories. Carmel would be knelt with a bunch of kids, watching a YouTube video they had all insisted on her watching, while Rowan would be hiding behind his book with his knees to his chest, his gaze glued to every page he flicked through, ignoring everyone. \n\nTeddy, making funny faces for kids who were scared, and Connor, handing out plates of burgers and hot dogs. I remembered feeling safe and at home, cosy around the flickering orange of the fire as chatter turned to laughter and white-noise in my head. After the kids went back to their cabins, the group of us would resume positions around the fire, but this time it was more\u2026 intimate. With Allison in her cabin, we kind of ignored her rules all together. \n\nMaking out happened, because of course it did. Beers stolen from Allison\u2019s mini fridge and raging hormones, as well as late-night skinny dipping in the lake did that. Couples went off into the woods, and we all felt completely comfortable and at home with each other. \n\nLooking around at that moment, I felt sick to my stomach. That feeling was gone. \n\nThe feeling of family and familiarity and friendship. What I was looking at now was that same log we had all sat on, now turned on its side\u2014hot dog buns and candy wrappers littering the ground. It was a ghost camp.\n\n I could still see Connor\u2019s jacket slung on the ground, and Lili\u2019s bright pink ray bans sitting on a beer can. Because there were no adults to yell at us to clean up after ourselves. I was frowning at the skeleton of the fire when Carmel nudged me. \u201cHey.\u201d Her voice was shaking slightly. \u201cJosie? You didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d Carmel wanted me to be the voice of reason, and I wasn\u2019t that. I was just as scared as her. \n\nThere was only so much I  could sugar-coat, and I gave up doing that after the third counsellor disappeared. All I could offer her was forced optimism.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d I said. \u201cJust keep the kids busy, alright?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\nWhen I was twisting around and power-walking to Rowan\u2019s cabin, I shouted over my shoulder, \u201cGive them some of those animal crackers!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat animal crackers?\u201d\n\nI turned to elaborate, but Carmel was gone. \n\nWhen I finally got to Rowan\u2019s cabin, I was sweating through my shirt, and had an idea of what I was going to tell the others. It was\u2026 a thing. Which could be considered a disease or a virus\u2014so it was vital that we split into two groups; half of us would search for the others, while the others would look for anything to get in contact with the outside world. An emergency landline, laptop, or cell phone. \n\nI did have one problem, which was lack of evidence. All which was left from the thing I\u2019d found was stuck to my foot. The rest of it was buried in the dirt. It was too dark to search for it, and we would be wasting time doing so. \n\nAll of that was in my mind and tangled on my tongue, one single string of incomprehensible gibberish I wasn\u2019t even sure was English, when I stepped into Rowan\u2019s cabin, where four sets of eyes met mine. Olive, cross legged on the floor with her arms folded, Harry, pacing up and down with a brand new bruise blooming under his eye, courtesy of Eleanor almost poking his eyes out\u2014and Rowan himself sitting on top bunk, his legs swinging off of the side. \n\nThe guy wasn\u2019t built to be our leader, originally being the laziest of our group, opting for sitting in a tree with a book, rather than helping set up camp activities. Yet he had become our default guy in charge because he so happened to be wearing the head counsellor hat when Allison disappeared. Admittedly, it suited him, the bright red of the cap contrasted his dark curls under a late setting sun through the back window, setting strands of straying hair on fire. \n\nThe hat was a little too big for his head, though, slipping over his eyes.\n\nRowan looked like a divorced father of two, dark circles bruising his eyes, and a very \u201cdad-like\u201d scowl curling on his lips.\n\nWith a clipboard pressed to his chest, and a pen he was chewing on, the boy resembled a grown man who had just caught his daughter coming in after curfew. \u201cJosie.\u201d Spitting the pen\u2019s lid out of his mouth, he scribbled something down. I had no doubt he was tracking my attendance for these stupid crisis meetings. His eyes were wild, scanning me for answers. \u201cWhere the fuck is Carmel?\u201d\n\nI shut the door behind me, leaning against it with my arms folded. \u201cSo, we can swear now?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Rowan rolled his eyes. \u201cThere are no kids here, so go crazy,\u201d he pointed at me with the pen. \u201cCarmel. Where is she?\u201d\n\n\u201cKeeping the kids busy,\u201d Callan\u2019s muffled voice came from the bottom bunk. I could barely see the guy lying on his stomach, his face stuffed into a pillow. \u201cIt was my idea to play Shrek for them, but the little shits said they haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d the boy lifted his head, his lips carved into a scowl. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, am I tripping? Everyone\u2019s seen Shrek! Do these kids expect the Minecraft movie?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t like that, either,\u201d Harry stopped pacing the cabin. \u201cEleanor looked at me like I was crazy when I asked if she liked it.\"\n\n\u201cFortnite, too.\u201d Olive said, a cushion pressed to her chest. \u201cI suggested playing it a few days ago, and like, zero kids knew what it was.\u201d\n\n\u201cSix counsellors are missing,\u201d Rowan raised his voice over the other\u2019s chatter. \u201cAnd you\u2019re questioning what games they like?\u201d His eyes found mine once more. \u201cSo, Carmel is with the kids? You\u2019re absolutely sure of it?\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cYeah. I mean, I just saw her five minutes ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat.\u201d Rowan said, sarcastically. \u201cI\u2019m sure she won\u2019t go missing under mysterious circumstances.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop.\u201d Olive shot him a glare, throwing a cushion in his face. \u201cI told you. They\u2019re probably lost\u2014- or maybe they went to get help?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been trained to know every inch of these woods,\u201d Rowan catapulted the cushion right back at her. \u201cThey\u2019re not lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, where are they?!\u201d Callan sat up, bringing his knees to his chest. I had never seen the guy looked this vulnerable. \u201cAllison made sense. She probably had other duties, and left us to look after the kids. But six counselors? All of them disappearing\u2014- our phone signal completely cutting out, electricity cutting off, not once, but twice? What is even sucking all of our power?\u201d\n\n\u201cI got the emergency generator working,\u201d Olive raised her arm. \u201cConnor and I managed it before\u2026\u201d she trailed off.\n\n\u201cBefore Connor disappeared.\u201d Callan finished for her. \u201cAnd before him, it was Joey, Lily, Mira, Yuri, Noah, and Teddy. Which isn\u2019t a fucking coincidence,\u201d he shot Rowan a look, who glared down at his lap. I could tell the boy didn\u2019t want to lead all of us, come up with plans and answer questions we desperately needed answering. His job was to look after us, as well as the littles, and so far, he was doing a pretty good job. I could tell by his expression that he thought the opposite, but he had managed to keep the kids from finding out about something as sinister as someone actively kidnapping counsellors. \n\nHe made sure they were fed, entertained, and safe watching a movie\u2014while we were scared for our lives. Rowan was keeping up the fa\u00e7ade no matter how scared he was. The boy dropped his head into his lap with a sigh. It looked like he might fall asleep before he slammed the clipboard into his face to wake himself up. \n\nNobody wanted to admit what Callan was saying, but we were all definitely thinking it. \u201cThis was planned.\u201d Callan continued. \n\n\u201cSomeone out here is fucking with us, very clearly trying to freak us out. Now they've got six of us. \u201d He spread out his arms. \u201cHow long until one of the littles gets taken, huh? A bunch of 18 year olds aren\u2019t going to satisfy them, so what about when they start taking campers? We are in the middle of fuckin\u2019 nowhere with a serial kidnapper on the loose, and did we really just leave fifteen kids in the care of a girl who thought Australia was in England?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Carmel\u2019s defence, she was black-out drunk when she said that,\u201d Olive murmured.\n\n\u201cVoice down!\u201d Rowan hissed. \u201cDo you want to scare them?!\u201d His gaze flicked to me. \u201cDid you do a headcount during dinner?\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cFifteen kids all accounted for. Ten are in the lunch hall, and five girls are in Cassie\u2019s cabin playing Operation.\u201d  \n\n\u201cAll day?\u201d Olive spoke up. \u201cWeren\u2019t they playing that this morning? I tried to get into their cabin to give them breakfast, but they just shooed me away and locked the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck.\u201d Rowan ran his fingers down his face. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go and see what\u2019s going on with them. Knowing Cassie and her friends, they\u2019re probably zonked out on stolen candy. When all of the kids are accounted for in the lunch cabin, we gather outside.\u201d\n\nI swallowed, speaking up. \u201cI actually wanted to talk to you guys about something.\u201d\n\nRowan lifted his head, jutting the edge of the clipboard into his chin. \u201cGo on\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI found something?\u201d I pulled a face. \u201cI mean, think I\u2019ve found something?\u201d\n\nI wasn't sure how to explain to a dwindling group of exhausted teenagers that there may be something even more terrifying than potential kidnappers out there. Four blank faces started back at me, and Rowan leaned forward with a frown. \u201cLike, in general? Josie, we don\u2019t have time to go foraging.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could call it a lead,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I need your eyes to find it.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh. But what is it?\u201d\n\nThinking back to what exactly I had seen, I had no idea how to describe it. \u201cIt\u2019s better if I just\u2026 showed you.\u201d\n\nRowan looked sceptical, but nodded. \u201cAlright. Josie comes with me. We\u2019ll check out Allison\u2019s cabin again to look for an emergency line, and you can show me whatever this \u2018thing\u2019 is you\u2019ve found. Then we\u2019ll escort Cassie and the other girl\u2019s to the lunch cabin. Every camper needs an escort from now on.  The rest of you? Act normal. If the kids see you freaking out, they will also freak out\u2014and we need to keep up morale.\u201d The boy pointed to Olive. \u201cOlive, you sit in with the kids and look after them. Callan, check out the emergency generator. Harry, the kids see you as a playground ride, so use that to your advantage. Offer them horse rides if they\u2019re scared. And stop with the ghost stories, it\u2019s making it worse. Give them piggybacks.\u201d\n\nHarry rolled his eyes. \u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nRowan cleared his throat. \u201cWe all keep up appearances. If the others turn up, after getting high or\u2026 I don\u2019t know, having an orgy in the woods\u2014- I will fucking kill them.\u201d The way he smiled through his teeth, jumping off the bunk, his toes primed like a wild animal,  I knew he wasn\u2019t joking. If this was a well-constructed prank the other counselors were playing, I had no doubt Rowan would rip them apart for leaving him as a reluctant leader. To my surprise, the others wandered off with their tasks.\n\nI watched Rowan lift up his pillow and pull out a pack of animal crackers, ripping open the bag and pouring the contents into his mouth. He caught my eye, crunching through mini animal crackers. \u201cI didn\u2019t have lunch,\u201d he said through a mouthful.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help feeling a sense of relief as we headed across camp, Rowan in front of me, while I lagged behind.\n\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s the plan?\u201d I caught up to him, almost tripping over a log.\n\nThe guy didn\u2019t turn around. \u201cI am completely winging it,\u201d he said through a choked laugh. \u201cI have no idea what I\u2019m doing, and if I\u2019m honest? I just want to go home, dude. I haven\u2019t looked after this many kids in my life, and if I have to smile one more time as a little brat, I am going to fucking lose my mind.\u201d He heaved out a breath. \u201cI am making this up as I go along.\u201d\n\nI laughed that time. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 comforting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d He turned to shoot me a grin. \u201cWell, rest assured I am just about as scared\u2014if not more scared than you,\u201d as we stopped in front of Cassie\u2019s cabin, his gaze found mine. \u201cIs it me\u2026\u201d he said softly, \u201cOr does the lunch cabin seem quiet.\u201d\n\nHe was right. The windows were dark when they should have been illuminated by the TV screen. Instead of answering, I stepped in front of him, grasping hold of the cabin door. \u201cCassie?\u201d I knocked three times. \u201cGirl\u2019s, are you okay in there? It\u2019s Josie and Rowan.\u201d I tried the door, and it slid open. Shooting a look at the boy behind me, I turned back to the door. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming in, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d\n\nCassie squeaked from inside. \u201cBut he\u2019s not finished!\u201d\n\nIgnoring the coil of dread unravelling in my gut, I forced the door open and stepped into unusually milky white light which flooded the cabin. The first thing I saw was eight-year-old Cassie, sitting cross legged with her back to me. She was sitting in a circle with the other girls, no doubt playing their game. \n\nWhen I stepped closer, however, I noticed something pooling across the wooden floor. It must have been juice or water that they had spilled. I took another step, but this time, clammy fingers wrapped around my wrist and yanked me back. Rowan didn't speak, but his eyes were elsewhere. Initially, they had been drinking in the cabin before they found oblivion entirely. I heard his breath start to accelerate, his grip tightening on my wrist.\n\nI had half a mind to pull away, before I saw the body shaped carcass the girls were sitting around. In the dim light of the cabin, it used to be a person. Teddy. I could still see parts of an identity, freckled cheeks and eyes which were still open, still staring at the sky. \n\nBut that was where the similarities to the missing counsellor ended. The thing which used to be Teddy was more of a shell, a scooped out thing resembling a human body. What sent me stumbling backwards, my mouth open in a silent scream, was the almost surgical efficiency of each organ's removal, like it really was a game of operation. His heart, lungs, and intestines were in one pile-- while his brain was cupped between little Cassie's bloody hands\u2014 and when my gaze found the little girl, Nina, hiding behind dark curly hair, I was seeing what looked like a toy robot\u2019s head in her hands. In my head, I was thinking about the eye with the metallic pieces glittering around its pupil, and something turned in my gut. \n\nDid I find a human eye? \n\nI was staring at the crevice inside the boy's skull, and the boxes of surgical equipment piled on the girl's bunks, when Rowan finally pulled me back, and I was stumbling straight onto my ass. \"We need to go.\" Rowan spoke through a croak. Cassie\u2019s words rattled in my head. Teddy, I thought.\n\nTeddy wasn\u2019t finished.\n\n\"Josie. Get up. Now!\" My head was spinning, and I was sure I'd thrown up. I didn\u2019t even realize we had managed to stumble from the girl\u2019s cabin before cool air grazed my face, tickling my  cheeks. Something wet and warm, and lumpy was spattering the front of my shirt. \n\nBefore I could coerce words, the boy was pulling me to my feet, and I was seeing stars in my eyes, blinking brightly. When the two of us started forwards in a run, Rowan stopped abruptly. I followed his gaze to find several kids surrounding his cabin, where Harry, Olive and Callan were. Maybe I was hallucinating, but Eleanor and Phoebe, both of whom wielding weapons where I had no idea where they had gotten them\u2014looked\u2026 taller? Rowan didn\u2019t waste time, dragging me back. \u201cAllison\u2019s cabin.\u201d He spoke in cry which became a sob, pulling me across camp, stumbling over rocky ground.\n\n\u201cWe need a phone. Fuck, we need a phone. We need a phone.\u201d Rowan was struggling to stand, occasionally bending over and choking up dust. \n\n\u201cThey were playing Operation.\"\n\nLiteral operation.\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019re just kids!\u201d I choked out. \n\nLittle kids, who had surgically removed every organ inside Teddy\u2019s body.\n\nLittle kids, who were hunting the other counsellors down, and would surely be coming for us.\n\nAllison\u2019s cabin was thankfully further into the woods. When we were safe inside and Rowan was locking the door, I dry heaved several times, unable to get the sight of glistening gore splattering the cabin floor from my mind. \u201cJosie.\u201d Rowan was already tearing apart the cabin. \u201cWork with me here, okay? We don\u2019t\u2026 we don\u2019t have fucking time to freak out, or to barf\u2014we need to get help. Now.\u201d Rowan was freaking out, and when he hit the ground on his knees, I took over. I searched Allison\u2019s desk first. \n\nNothing of importance, just documents and invoices. Digging through her draw, there was still nothing. We were running out of time. \n\nAbandoning the desk, I went through her suitcase and bags. When I was crawling under her bed to try and find a weapon, Rowan hissed out. \u201cWait.\u201d When I turned to him, he was still kneeling, but his foot was clamping down on a loose plank. The guy didn\u2019t hesitate, pulling at the loose plank, which, to my confusion, revealed what looked to me like a trap door.\n\nRowan turned to me. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d\n\nI could only stare at the trap door revealing stone steps. He peered down, his voice echoing. \u201cAllison has a fucking secret bunker?\u201d\n\nHis lips curved into a surprisingly childish grin which took me off guard. \u201cOh, wow, that\u2019s so cooooool!\u201d  \n\nLifting my head at the sound of loud squealing, I glimpsed a group of littles led by Eleanor stalking towards us. Eleanor had a hostage. Harry. And with the way she was sticking the blade of a scary looking knife to his throat, I figured she meant business.\n\nTheir height difference was almost comical. The eighteen year old guy had to hunch over so the little girl could successfully keep him prisoner. Behind them in the trees, I could see something illuminating the dark, an electric blue light bathing their faces.\n\nSo, that was there the power was going.\n\nBut what the fuck were these eight-year-old\u2019s doing?\n\n\u201cJosie!\u201d Rowan hissed from down below. He had already climbed down. \n\nI joined him, struggling down the stone steps, before replacing the loose plank. If these kids were as smart as I thought, it wouldn\u2019t take them long to realize the loose plank\u2014also a trap door. Allison\u2019s bunker was more of a control room. There were multiple screens lit up, a chair in front of a working MacBook. The phone-line was cut. But that didn\u2019t make sense. \n\nThe kids were unaware of the bunker, so who cut the phone lines? Rowan was on the laptop, struggling to get through the password protection, so I turned my attention to piles of cardboard boxes. \n\nWhen I opened them, I found myself staring at animal crackers. \n\nThere were hundreds of them, packed on top of each other. Looking further, digging through the boxes, I found a piece of old crumpled paper which looked ancient.\n\nREGARDING PROJECT SPEARHEAD SUBJECTS:\n\nPLEASE DO NOT INGEST UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. IF MULTIPLE SUBJECTS INGEST, PLEASE USE SELF DESTRUCT.\n\nONLY USE IN CASES SUCH AS IMMINENT DESTRUCTION TO THE PLANET/THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR. \n\n(PLEASE CONTACT FAMILIES IN ADVANCE. MAKE SURE TO INGEST WITH WATER TO AVOID NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS SUCH AS PSYCHOSIS, EXTREME VIOLENCE. PLEASE APPROACH SUBJECTS WITH CAUTION.\n\nSomething ice cold slithered down my spine.\n\nAbandoning the boxes, I searched through a cabinet filled with files which were crumbling apart from age. I picked one at random and flicked through it.\n\n**Eleanor Summer\u2019s.**\n\n**Sex: Female.**\n\n**DOB: 08/05/1977.**\n\nInitially, I thought I was reading the dates wrong. But then, with my heart in my throat, I was grasping for other files.\n\n**Eli Evermore.**\n\n**Sex: Male.**\n\n**'DOB: 08/03/1979.**\n\n\u201cRowan.\u201d I managed to get out through a breath.\n\n\u201cMm?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not children.\u201d\n\nThe boy rubbed his eyes, frowning. His eyes were half lidded, almost confused. \u201cHuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cEleanor.\u201d I whispered. \u201cIs forty five years old.\u201d\n\nHe nodded slowly, turning back to the laptop. \u201cHow do you spell\u2026 documents? I\u2019m looking for digital versions but I can\u2019t find any.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how to spell documents?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a hard day.\u201d The boy whined, tipping his head back and blowing a raspberry.\n\nWhatever I was going to say was choked in the back of my throat, when a loud bang sounded from above, the sounds of childish giggling coming through the floorboards. But the laughter didn\u2019t sound like little kids. No, it sounded like teenager\u2019s who were acting like little kids. I stared at the boxes of animal crackers, and then at the file confirming Eleanor\u2019s real age.\n\nMy own words shuddered through me, and I remembered finding Teddy\u2019s dismembered carcass in Cassie\u2019s cabin. When I had caught her gaze, the little girl didn\u2019t look scared, and somehow, her fingers wrapped around the scalpel looked just right.\n\nLike the little bitch knew exactly what she was doing.\n\n\u201cHelloooo?\u201d Harry\u2019s voice was a hysterical giggle. \u201cOlly, Olly, Oxen freeee!\u201d  \n\n\u201cAre you in heeeeeeere?\u201d Carmel joined in. I could hear their footsteps above, dancing across the room.\n\nClamping my hand over my mouth, I dragged my knees to my chest and prayed they weren\u2019t smart enough to figure out we were right underneath them.\n\nKnowing the truth about them, though? I wasn\u2019t counting on it.\n\n\u2026.\n\nThat was an hour ago.\n\nWe\u2019re still stuck down here, and I can get a connection here\u2014thank god. For some reason, Alison has blocked all social media. We need help. We\u2019re at Camp Redwood, and these kids ARE NOT KIDS. \n\nWhatever Project Spearhead is was designed to keep them here. \n\nThe phone-line is cut so we can\u2019t get help from whoever was helping Allison. I am counting on you guys.\n\nGet us out of here!",

    "postText": "Season 2\n\n\u201cYou ready Bruce?\u201d\n\n\u201cReady as I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d\n\nExcept, I\u2019m not ready. How can I be? I barely survived Season One. And the Season Finale was a disaster. The poor contestant was burned to a crisp. Smelled like barbecue chicken and rotten eggs.\n\n\u201cQuiet on the set!\u201d\n\nI suck in my gut.\n\n\u201cGoing live in five\u2026 four\u2026 three\u2026 two\u2026\u201d\n\n(Cue creepy music)\n\n(Cut to camera one)\n\nI get the nod.\n\n\u201cHello out there, wherever you are. Welcome to Season Two of\u2026\u201d\n\n(Cue audience)\n\n\u201cLET\u2019S MAKE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL.\u201d\n\n(Cut to camera three)\n\nI tease the audience.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright. Knock it off!\u201d\n\nI check my watch.\n\n\u201cMy name is Bruce Davie, and I'm terrified...I mean... happy to be here. Alright, now that the formalities are over, lets bring out today\u2019s contestant, shall we?\u201d\n\nAudience applauds.\n\n(Cut to camera four)\n\nA generous woman wearing yoga pants and a loose-fitting Lynyrd Skynyrd tee-shirt appears on screen. She fist-pumps across the stage.\n\nI roll my eyes. Where do they find these people?\n\n(Split screen)\n\n\u201cTell us a bit about yourself, starting with who you are and where you\u2019re from.\u201d I look directly into the camera, raise an eyebrow. \u201cBut please, make it brief. We wouldn\u2019t want to keep the Devil waiting, would we?\u201d\n\nThe audience oohs and ahs.\n\nThe heavily tattooed woman shakes her head. \n\n\u201cGood to be here, Bruce. I just love\u2026\u201d\n\nShe flaps her meaty arms in the air.\n\n(Cue audience)\n\n\u201cLET\u2019S MAKE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL.\u201d\n\nI shake my head, then immediately straighten up. Mustn\u2019t stray from the script. Maybe, just maybe, I can save her from a gruesome fate. \n\n(Cut to camera four)\n\n\u201cName\u2019s Bertha. Bertha Squires. Folks back home call me Big Bertha. I\u2019m from the great state of Georgia. I like beers and barbecued ribs, and Lynyrd Skynyrd played real loud. And I loooove the Falcons. Let\u2019s go Falcons!\u201d\n\nThe audience cheers.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d I say, signalling the audience to simmer down. \u201cLet\u2019s get down to business, shall we? I do believe it\u2019s time to\u2026\u201d\n\n(Cue audience)\n\n\u201cBRING OUT THE DEVIL.\u201d\n\n(Cue creepy music)\n\nThe lights flicker. Minty fog stretches across the studio. An illuminated pentagram flashes above the audience, much to their delight.\n\nMy stomach sinks into my toes. I hate this part. Damion doesn\u2019t take part in the rehearsals. He appears only when the camera\u2019s are rolling. Although on occasion, his deep, guttural voice wafts from the producer\u2019s office. Like today, when I overheard them discussing the future of the show. My name wasn\u2019t mentioned.\n\nFire flashes across the stage.\n\nDamion suddenly appears.\n\nThe audience gasps.\n\n(Cut to camera three)\n\nCloseup of Damion wearing his elaborate, skin-tight red devil suit. His leather tail swings confidently, to the delight of our viewers. Apparently, Hell beings get one hour of leisure time a week, and they love this show. How they get this small-scale show in the first place is beyond me. Maybe Hell has good WiFi. \n\nDamion tilts his black fedora, then he extends an arm, hushing the audience.\n\n\u201cGood evening!\u201d\n\nThe audience applauds.\n\nDamion smiles slyly, showcasing his gold-tooth display.\n\n\u201cSo, Bertha,\u201d he exaggerates her name. \u201cLet\u2019s cut to the chase. Tell me\u2026 no tell the viewers\u2026 what it is you most desire?\u201d\n\n(Split screen)\n\nThe Devil sneers.\n\nBertha puffs out her chest.\n\n\u201cWell Damion, I want what every American wants.\u201d\n\nThe audience leans in.\n\n\u201cMo money!\u201d\n\nThe audience jumps to their feet, cheering.\n\n(Cut to camera one)\n\nI see myself in the monitors. I seem so small and insignificant.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d I say shakily. \u201cI\u2019m sure Damion can manage that. After all, he IS the Devil.\u201d\n\n(Enter creepy music)\n\n(Cut to camera three)\n\nThe Devil's grin sends chills coursing down my spine.\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d he says, fiddling his fingers. \u201cI can certainly arrange that.\u201d\n\n(Cut to camera four)\n\nBertha starts fist-pumping, to the audience\u2019s delight.\n\n\u201cBut first,\u201d he sneers into the camera, \u201cyou must sign a contract. Then it's official.\u201d \n\nHe snaps his fingers, the sound ricochets across the studio like a thunderclap. Suddenly, he\u2019s holding an ancient-looking contract made of human skin. I\u2019ll be damned if the words aren\u2019t written in blood. \n\nI shudder.\n\n(Split screen)\n\nDamion hands her the contract. \n\nThe contestant places the parchment on to the pedestal; a pool of sweat glistens from her gleaming forehead.\n\nDamion\u2019s eyes sparkle like oceans of evil.\n\nShe winces as he touches her arm.\n\nThe Devil turns to the audience.\n\n\u201cWhatcha think?\u201d His voice sounds like an ashtray. \u201cShould Bertha be America\u2019s next billionaire?\u201d\n\n\u201cHell yeah!\u201d Bertha fist pumps, then raises her arms upwards. \u201cLord, let the money rain over me!\u201d\n\nThe audience agrees.\n\nI shrink into my shoes. Could this get any worse?\n\n(Cut to camera four)\n\n\u201cExcellent.\u201d Damion snaps his spidery fingers. Suddenly, he\u2019s holding a quilted pen. \u201cSign here, here and\u2026.\u201d He\u2019s making a mockery of this. \u201cInitial here.\u201d\n\nCautiously, Bertha takes the pen.\n\n\u201cBut read through it carefully. Because\u2026\u201d\n\n(Cue audience)\n\n\u201cTHE DEVIL\u2019S IN THE DETAILS.\u201d\n\nBertha\u2019s round face turns scarlet. Her beady eyes show a mixture of terror and greed.\n\n(Split screen)\n\nThe devil licks his lips.\n\nThe audience holds its breath.\n\nThe contract trembles in the contestant\u2019s hands.\n\nYawning, Damion taps his Rolex, then gives the camera his million-dollar grin.\n\n\u201cHurry it up, wouldya? We\u2019re on live television!\u201d\n\nThe audience chants: \u201cSIGN IT... SIGN IT\u2026 SIGN IT\u2026\u201d\n\nClose up of the contestant leaning over, about to sign.\n\n\u201cUh uh.\u201d Damion snaps his fingers; a bottle of ink appears.\n\nThe contestant dips the pen into the jar of red ink.\n\nThe audience rises to its feet.\n\nThe contestant signs the contract.\n\n(Cut to camera one)\n\nMy game-show-host smile is stapled to my face.\n\n\u201cWell done, Bertha. You\u2019ve just made a deal with the Devil!\u201d\n\nThe audience goes ballistic.\n\n(Camera pans out)\n\nGrinning grotesquely, Damion flies above the audience, whose necks are stretched like cranes. \n\n(Close up of the Devil)\n\n\u201cI, the one known as Lucifer, the truly wicked one, proclaims\u2026.\u201d His arms stretch across the entire studio. \u201cLet it rain cold, hard, cash!\u201d\n\nThe audience is delirious.\n\nThunder crashes. Shots ring out. Everyone screams, including me. This wasn\u2019t part of the script. But then again, when does Damion follow the script?\n\n(Cut to camera five)\n\nThe Devil snaps his finger. \n\nThe studio dissolves into dust. Suddenly, instead of being inside a cheap Hollywood studio, we\u2019re packed inside a football stadium. The smell of stale beer and popcorn prevails.\n\nI stumble as my heart threatens to explode. I clutch my chest, fearing the worst. My face turns red, then green, then settles on pale-white.\n\nDamion gives me his do-as-I-say look, then points up. \n\nLooking up, my stomach fills with dread. A lone, greenback cascades from the sky, landing on the contestant\u2019s head. She snatches it, stuffs it between her breasts.\n\nMore money falls. Within seconds, the stadium fills with cash. Bertha gets down to business.\n\nDamion flies across the stadium, singing, \u201cLet it rain, let it rain, let it rain.\u201d His dreadful voice comes through the stadium speakers.\n\nPandemonium ensues.\n\n(Cut to overhead camera)\n\nLike a plague of locusts, money plummets into the stadium. The sky darkens. The audience is on their feet, seizing the cash. Kicking and clawing, biting and scratching, they line their pockets.\n\nThe Devil snaps his finger. Almost immediately, the downpour turns torrential. A never-ending flow of cash is dropped into the stadium. The air becomes difficult to breathe. \n\nPeople panic. \n\n(Cut to camera two)\n\nMy game show-host smile is slipping. With all my might, I finally speak.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it raining cats and dogs, but this is ridiculous!\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, my legs are trapped under three feet of cash. I\u2019m losing my equilibrium.\n\n(Cut to camera three)\n\nDamion hovers over the contestant, who\u2019s waist-deep in cash, and offers her money bags.\n\n\u201cFill em up!\u201d he shouts.\n\n(Split screen)\n\nBertha snatches the money bags and starts filling them.  \n\nAudience members, the lucky ones seated at the top, are chanting: \u201cFILL THEM UP\u2026 FILL THEM UP\u2026\u201d\n\nContestant appears on the jumbo screen. She\u2019s desperate, unable to keep up with the rising tides. The storm shows no sign of letting up, and she\u2019s getting the worst of it.\n\n(Cut to overhead camera)\n\nThe storm turns into an avalanche. The entire front row is crushed. Their screams are inaudible over the madness. They disappear. To my left, a middle-aged man is choking on an Andrew Jackson. His arms and legs are buried. I watch him get trampled, as a crowd of money-grabbers knock him aside. \n\n(Cut to camera four)\n\nDamion\u2019s eyes are dancing, as he removes his fedora and fills it with cash.\n\n(Cut to camera four)\n\nBertha is up to her tits in cash; her big body buried under a mountain of green.\n\nHer eyes meet mine.\n\n\u201cBruce! Make it stop! No more money. Pleeeease.\u201d\n\nHer words scatter like paper in the breeze.\n\n(Cut to camera one)\n\nI shrug.\n\n\u201cLooks like Bertha got a bad deal!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m surprised at how calm I sound. In truth, I\u2019m petrified. She\u2019s not the only one being buried alive. One wrong move and I\u2019m a goner.\n\n(Cut to camera four)\n\nDamion soars across the stadium. The scoreboard lights up. Bertha\u2019s name flashes across the screen. Apparently, she\u2019s up by seven.\n\n(Cut to camera three)\n\nBertha is choking on cash, tears leaking from her frantic eyes.  \n\n(Split screen)\n\nThe Devil, delighted in her discomfort, applauds. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re rich, Bertha!\u201d His laughter fills the stadium, plus millions of homes in Hell, with dread.\n\nBertha cusses.\n\nDamion waves his finger, giving her a no-no gesture.\n\n(Cut to overhead camera)\n\nThe audience is in a frenzy. A family of four are holding hands, saying prayers. They\u2019re drowning. Quickly, the children disappear. The mother shrieks, \u201cNooooooo!\u201d The father frantically cries, \u201cSomeone doooo something!\u201d \n\nThe Devil zooms across the field and lands next to them.\n\n(Cut to camera five) \n\n\u201cHere to help,\u201d he says. Then he flicks his finger, and punts the parents across the field for a pair of field goals.\n\n\u201cSix points!\u201d I proclaim.\n\nUnder siege, the stadium succumbs to chaos. On the jumbo screen, a teenager, with earbuds dangling from his skinny neck, is trying to escape. \u201cThe doors are locked!\u201d Someone shoves him aside; he goes sprawling down a flight of stairs, face-first. He lands with a thud. A blonde woman wearing golden earrings steps on his back, while her partner snatches the teen\u2019s wallet. As they turn away, an avalanche buries them alive. \n\n(Cut to camera four)\n\nThe contestant is trying to speak, but her mouth is stuffed with cash. She\u2019s choking. Her eyes pop, as the realization hits her: She\u2019s going to die. \n\n(Close up of contestant)\n\nHer eyes disappear. Only her head remains. Then, she\u2019s gone.\n\n(Cut to camera one)\n\nI point and shrug.\n\n\u201cBertha forgot to read the fine print!\u201d\n\nI hate the sound of my voice.\n\n(Overhead camera)\n\nDamion races towards me, his pitchforked tail blowing in the breeze. As he approaches, a haggard-looking man, waist deep in money, swipes his ankle. Damion hoofs him into the end zone. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good\u201d I say, automatically, surprising myself. \u201cThe home team leads by two!\u201d\n\n(Split screen)\n\nThe audience is frantic. Audience members are jumping over railings, trying to escape. The entire field is buried. \n\nMoney falls like furious snow. I wiggle my toes to make sure they still work.  \n\n(Cut to camera two)\n\nI straighten up.\n\nThere\u2019s no sign of Bertha. She\u2019s buried.\n\n\u201cLooks like Bertha got more than she bargained for!\u201d\n\nA brick of bills smashes the side of my face. I wince. Soon I\u2019ll be buried like Bertha. I hope my mother isn't watching. \n\n(Split screen)\n\nDamion grins menacingly at the camera. \n\n\u201cYes, she most certainly did.\u201d \n\nHe\u2019s playing with his tail. \n\nAudience members are trying to free themselves. Their efforts are in vain. The cameras, mounted on drones, capture everything. \n\n(Close up of the Devil)\n\nDamion regards me pitifully, then turns to the camera and winks.\n\n\u201cBruce,\u201d the delight in his voice sickens me. \u201cYou\u2019re drowning!\u201d\n\nI am. I really am.\n\n(Cut to camera three)\n\nDamion zooms over, lands on my head. Perched like a bird, he snaps his fingers. The sound is like a sonic boom. Suddenly, we\u2019re back in the studio. So is the audience, the lucky ones, that is, who\u2019ve managed to stay alive.  \n\n(Split screen)\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d he drags the word through the mud. \u201cWhat\u2019s this I hear of you wanting a salary increase?\u201d\n\nI gulp. This is news to me.\n\n(Cut to camera one)\n\nMy bald forehead gleams across the screen like a greasy burger.\n\nThe audience nervously laughs.\n\n(Cut to camera three)\n\nDamion snaps his fingers. Another contract appears. He hands it to me.\n\nMy hands wobble as I give it a glance.\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019s what I call a raise!\u201d I say this involuntarily.\n\nDamion is lurking over me, hatred fuming from his unholy pores. When he touches my shoulder, I jump.\n\nSmoke fills the studio.\n\n(Cut to camera three)\n\nThe Devil snickers into the camera.\n\n\u201cWhatcha think? Should Bruce sign?\u201d\n\nThe audience cheers.\n\nDamion hands me his pen, which is surprisingly heavy. His cold, calculated eyes never leave mine.\n\n(Cut to camera one)\n\nLooking nervously at the audience, I raise my arms in a vee.\n\n\u201cShould I sign?\u201d\n\nThe audience chants: \u201cSIGN IT\u2026 SIGN IT\u2026 SIGN IT\u2026.\u201d.\n\nMy eyes catch the dollar amount carved onto the paper. It\u2019s a lucrative deal. In fact, I\u2019d say it\u2019s too good to be true. The problem is: I\u2019m too scared to read the fine print, although the rational part of my mind is screaming at me to do so. All the while, my pounding heart threatens to explode. Making a deal with the devil is the furthest thing from my mind.\n\n(Cut to camera three)\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d says the Devil. \u201cWhatcha afraid of?\u201d\n\n\u201cSIGN IT\u2026 SIGN IT\u2026 SIGN IT\u2026.\u201d\n\n(Split screen)\n\nI wipe my forehead. \n\n\u201cJeez. Talk about pressure.\u201d\n\nThe Devil folds his arms.\n\nReluctantly, I sign.\n\nThe crowd roars its approval.\n\n(Cut to camera two)\n\n\u201cWell, there you have it folks. Looks like Bertha got more than she\u2019d bargained for. And apparently, I did too!\u201d\n\n(Cue the creepy music)\n\n\u201cI hope you had as much fun as we did. And I look forward to seeing you on the next addition of\u2026\u201d\n\n(Cue the audience)\n\n\u201cLET\u2019S MAKE A DEAL WITH THE [DEVIL.\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromStarr/)\n\n[Season 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/sew9lu/im_the_host_of_a_terrifying_new_game_show_lets/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)",

    "postText": "If I was going to [throw Daniel under the bus](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13876eu/how_to_survive_college_for_once_nepotism_is_a/), then I should at least warn him that he needed to cooperate with whatever the flickering man demanded.  It doesn\u2019t matter what Daniel does or doesn\u2019t deserve - I don\u2019t want to be the kind of person that hands someone to the inhumans with no preparation or even a warning.  I can\u2019t make choices for people and I can\u2019t live their lives for them, but I can do this much.  I can warn him and then the rest is up to him.\n\nBut first,  I was going to take the devil\u2019s advice.\n\n(if you\u2019re new, start [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rnauck/how_to_survive_the_holidays/), and if you\u2019re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/))\n\nI rehearsed.  I stood in front of the mirror on the back of our dorm door and practiced what I would say to him.  I had an agenda.  First: inform Daniel that he wasn\u2019t free of this just because the worm wasn\u2019t after him anymore.  Get his attention.  Second: tell him that an inhuman was going to contact him and he had to be polite and work with him.  Tell him that his life would be in danger if he didn\u2019t and this time, there wouldn\u2019t be an easy escape.  Third: demand an apology for how he\u2019d treated me.\n\nAnd maybe if that all went well, dig for more information about that note he received.\n\nCassie didn\u2019t comment on my practicing, but I did get the vibe that she thought I was being kind of weird.  Whatever.  Talking to other people doesn\u2019t come naturally for everyone, you know.  Some of us feel like giant awkward balls of awkward whenever we\u2019re interacting with others.  You\u2019d think I wouldn\u2019t be like this, coming from a big family and all, but I dunno, maybe it\u2019s genetic or something.\n\nIt kind of pisses me off though that I put all that work into what I was going to say and then it all turned out to be for nothing.\n\nBecause Daniel slammed the door in my face before I could get a word out.\n\nI got into his dorm easily enough.  For as much as the university talks about dorm security and not letting people glide in after you without using a keycard, you\u2019d think people would pay attention to it at some point.  Nope.  I got in, I got up to his floor, and I found his room with the door hanging open.  He was at his desk with his back to the hallway.  I took a breath, composed myself, and said his name.  I said I needed to talk to him.\n\nHe jumped from his seat like he\u2019d been burned.  I was about to launch into my first point - that he wasn\u2019t out of danger yet - but then he lunged across the room and grabbed hold of the door.  He flung it shut.\n\nIf I had been standing any closer, I think it would have broken my nose.\n\nThen I heard the heavy click of the deadbolt.\n\nFine.  If he wasn\u2019t going to talk to me, then I wasn\u2019t going to keep trying.  I could stand here outside the door and give my speech but I didn\u2019t want to anymore.  Screw it.  That\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned from this whole ordeal with Daniel at least - you gotta give up at some point.  You can\u2019t help someone who doesn\u2019t want to be helped.  And I think I know why he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me.  Why he doesn\u2019t want to even *look* at me.\n\nI caught a glimpse of his face right before the door closed between us.  He looked guilty.\n\nHe didn\u2019t want to be reminded of what he\u2019d done.  He knew he\u2019d screwed up and instead of scratching his skin off, the guilt was now eating him up on the inside.\n\nConsidering what I went through to fix my mistakes, it\u2019s hard to feel sorry for him.\n\nBut anyway the next place I went was the vaguely phallic rock outside of the administration building.\n\n\u201cHis name is Daniel,\u201d I said as soon as the flickering man appeared.\n\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t take long for you to confirm.\u201d  His eyes narrowed.  \u201cDid you have prior knowledge?\u201d\n\nHe said it like an accusation.  He already suspected I did.  Whatever.  It wouldn\u2019t make the situation any worse to admit it.\n\n\u201cHe wanted our help with the worm and then didn\u2019t listen to us and screwed it all up and let it loose instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cI *knew* you were lying to me,\u201d he muttered.  \u201cWhat made you change your mind?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an ungrateful little shit who doesn\u2019t deserve my help.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh that\u2019s music to my ears,\u201d he sighed.  \u201cEvery inhuman thing loves those kinds of people.  They\u2019re delicious.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t going to kill him!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of fleshy bits that you humans can survive without.  Since you said he didn\u2019t listen to you, I\u2019ll introduce myself by taking off one of his ears.  Seems fair.  It\u2019ll be one of those *teaching moments* that you humans all love so much.\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes for a moment.  At least Daniel would be alive and the worm would be gone.\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d I said stiffly.  \u201cWhatever gets this situation dealt with.  Good luck with that.\u201d\n\nThe flickering man was still watching me thoughtfully, a finger poised on his chin.\n\n\u201cI promised you a favor,\u201d he said thoughtfully.  \u201cWhat do you want?  Has to be reasonable.\u201d\n\nWas \u2018don\u2019t kill Daniel?\u2019 reasonable?  Could I stop the flickering man from taking an ear off?  Did I even care at this point?  Besides, I\u2019d tried and tried so much for Daniel and so had Maria and there was someone in my life that was far more deserving of help right now.\n\n\u201cYou seem to know everything that\u2019s going on around here,\u201d I said quietly.  \u201cDo you know all the students that die?\u201d\n\n\u201cI miss a few, but otherwise the odds are very good that I\u2019m aware of a death on campus.\u201d\n\nHis tone was soft.  He was so still he might have been carved from stone.  I had an uncanny feeling that I had the whole of his interest and he was intent on what I was going to ask for next.  That this favor he\u2019d promised me hadn\u2019t been a lure to get me to give him a name, but that he merely wanted to see what I would do with it.\n\n\u201cEven the ones that happened a while ago?\u201d I asked.  \u201cDo you keep track of them?\u201d\n\n\u201cI *do* keep track.  Lucky for you.\u201d  He smiled, showing his teeth.  \u201cWho do you want to know about?\u201d\n\nI told him about Cassie\u2019s roommate.  I asked him what had happened to her.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d  He sounded disappointed.  \u201cThat\u2019s what you want to know?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to me,\u201d I said defensively.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s important to someone you\u2019re not going to have contact with in another three years, but sure, whatever, you tell yourself that.\u201d\n\nI wanted to argue, but also this was *an inhuman* and arguing with inhumans rarely ended well, so I kept silent.  He smiled maliciously and paused, his gaze sliding sideways to stare off somewhere in the distance.  Reminiscing.\n\n\u201cI know what happened to her,\u201d he murmured thoughtfully.  \u201cThe thing in the hallway took her.  Crunched her bones up nice and fine.  It wasn\u2019t especially hungry, so it chewed slowly.  Really savored all the meaty bits before getting to the organs.  Is that what you wanted to know?\u201d\n\nNo.  It wasn\u2019t what I wanted to know.  Not anymore.  I felt sick.  I wanted him to be lying, I wanted this to be just another of his taunts designed to make me hate him, but he was inhuman and most inhumans don\u2019t lie.  I have a feeling he\u2019s one of the ones that don\u2019t lie.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all there is to it,\u201d he concluded.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you were hoping to learn - or accomplish - with this, but I have nothing more to give you.\u201d\n\nIt was just another stupid, pointless death.  Just another person consumed by the never-ending hunger of the inhuman world.  There was no reason for it, no purpose, nothing but pure misfortune.\n\nJust like how my father died.\n\nHow did I tell Cassie?  Could I trust myself to lie to her?  Look her in the eye and tell her that her roommate was dead but that at least she died quickly?  That she didn\u2019t suffer?\n\nI\u2019d wasted a favor.  Perhaps that was why the flickering man was staring at me with such amusement in his eyes.\n\n\u201cYou could have just said she\u2019s dead,\u201d I said quietly.  \u201cI didn\u2019t need the details.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou asked and I gave you the *full* answer,\u201d he retorted.  \u201cAnyway, I suppose our cooperation is concluded then.  I\u2019ll just pop over and deal with the worm and then I\u2019ll get back to finding a way to kill you slowly and horribly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said no threats!\u201d\n\nHe grinned.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a threat,\u201d he said sweetly.  \u201cThat\u2019s a promise.\u201d\n\nAnd he vanished.\n\nNeither Maria nor I have contact with Daniel anymore, so I don\u2019t know if anything has happened yet.  But life goes on.  There\u2019s still classes to go to and homework to finish.  And in the time since I last posted, there\u2019s also been an interesting development in the geology department.\n\nI think we all know that when I say \u2018interesting\u2019 what I really mean is \u2018awful\u2019 because that\u2019s just how my life is I guess.\n\nQuick refresher on the professors in the geology department.  Professor Monotone is who I had last semester and he somehow managed to make dinosaurs boring.  Bad news: I have him again this semester.  The geology department isn\u2019t that big so I think it's going to be unavoidable that I get him as my professor a few more times before I graduate.\n\nProfessor L. is the other professor I\u2019ve had and I like him a bit better, if only because he actually has a personality.  He asks how I\u2019m doing when he sees me in the hallway between classes and if there\u2019s no one around, he asks if I\u2019m still going to counseling.\n\nI am and we\u2019re talking a lot about how past events are not an indication of the future and how to avoid thinking that way.  Basically she\u2019s trying to help reconfigure my brain so that it doesn\u2019t assume everyone around me is going to die like my dad and my ex-boyfriend did.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of hard to make progress when you know there really are monsters out there and that your friends are on the menu, tbh.\n\nBut anyway, Professor L. is just trying to help so I\u2019m polite to him.  I hope that I can get in his classes next year instead of Professor Monotone.  Or maybe even someone new, I saw another name on the schedule for some of the 300-level classes I\u2019ll be taking soon.  In the meantime, I\u2019m stuck struggling to stay awake in class.  At least it\u2019s not in the lecture hall, so that\u2019s helped.  And since pretty much every classroom with windows borders the graveyard, I\u2019d had pure stress to keep me alert ever since the encounter with the groundskeeper.\n\nI keep feeling like he\u2019s out there, staring at me from inside the graveyard, but I think that\u2019s just my nerves because every time I look I only see trees.\n\nNo, the trees are not changing locations, before anyone can ask in the comments.  They are only trees.  I\u2019m just paranoid.\n\nAt least being mostly cognizant during class meant I didn\u2019t scream and fall out of my seat when Professor L. burst in through the door.  Some people near me did, though.  I don\u2019t blame them.  It is rather startling to be sitting there half asleep and then have a door slam into the wall like a gunshot.  But Professor L. didn\u2019t notice that he\u2019d just taken a couple years of life off half the students in the classroom.  He turned and slammed the door shut behind him, crumpling against it and sliding down underneath the window.  He craned his head back, peering up through the window.  He was staring at the hallway ceiling.\n\n\u201cIs\u2026 everything okay?\u201d Professor Monotone ventured.\n\n\u201cI saw something,\u201d Professor L. whispered.  \u201cOn the ceiling.\u201d\n\nOh no.  Noooooo.  I quietly slumped further in my seat in the hopes that no one would notice the look of horror on my face.  I needn\u2019t have worried.  Everyone was staring at Professor L as he cowered by the door, straining to see if he was still being followed by whatever was out there.\n\n\u201cOh, did you finally see the resident ghost?\u201d Professor Monotone asked.\n\n\u201cIt was covered in\u2026 *stabbed* with\u2026 pieces of glass.\u201d\n\nWere they seriously having this conversation?  In front of the entire class?\n\nA couple students giggled.  I glanced around covertly, taking note of the students that didn\u2019t look amused.  About a third of them had grim or fearful expressions.  Honestly, more than I expected.\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re welcome to stay here for a bit,\u201d Professor Monotone said cheerfully.  \u201cI\u2019ve found that it\u2019ll go away if you wait a little bit.\u201d\n\nProfessor L. nodded mutely and staggered to his feet.  He went to the back of the room and sat down at an empty desk.  And Professor Monotone just\u2026 kept lecturing like nothing had happened.  Professors are wild, y\u2019all.\n\nProfessor L. stayed until the end of class.  I\u2019d resolved to go talk to him in his office immediately after and find out what had changed.  The obvious concern is that the piece of petrified wood is gone, because my whole theory hinges on it being what\u2019s protecting him.  I needed to know, because if something had gone wrong with it, then I needed to warn Cassie.  Unfortunately, Professor L. ducked out of the classroom as soon as Professor Monotone started wrapping up.  I had to anxiously wait to find out what the assigned reading was, then I had to fight my way past all my classmates.  They were all talking about the ghost - sounded like I\u2019m not the only one to have seen it at some point - and I desperately wanted to participate, but I didn\u2019t want to lose Professor L. either.  I turned down the hallway towards the offices, hoping that I could catch Professor L. before he shut himself up inside.\n\nI found his office door shut.  I knocked and after a moment I called out that it was me, Ashley, and I wanted to ask about the ghost.  I reminded him that I\u2019d seen it before and that I might know something that could help him.  Then I waited in nervous silence.  I even put my ear against the door to see if I could hear him shuffling around in there.\n\nNothing.\n\nHe must have fled the building instead.  I regretted not staying behind to talk to the other students about the ghost.\n\nSomething touched my cheek.  I flinched and saw in the corner of my eye a hand, languidly stretching out its fingers.  Blood stained them in a thick, tacky layer, not dripping, but not quite dried either.\n\nI didn\u2019t move.  I stood there, staring straight at the locked door in front of me.  The hand hovered just at the edge of my field of vision and I slowly became aware of a noise behind me.  Breathing.  Soft, rasping breathing.  The hair on the back of my neck prickled.  The seconds stretched by, each beat of my heart feeling like an eternity of waiting.  Did I try to run?  Did I wait until it moved on?  Professor Monotone had said it would go away if you waited.\n\nI closed my eyes and counted to twenty in my head.  When I opened my eyes again, I could no longer see its hand hovering by my cheek.  I began to shake, trembling violently like I was freezing in the snow.  I clenched my jaw to keep my teeth from chattering together.  It was gone.  It had to be gone.  I\u2019d just turn around and walk out of here.  Stiffly, I unlocked my muscles, and turned around.\n\nIt was not gone.\n\nIt had just been waiting.\n\nAnd now I was facing it, staring directly into the two big shards of glass that were thrust into its eye sockets.\n\nI jerked backwards and came up hard against the office door.  It was standing directly in front of me now, its shoulders hunched high enough that they were even with the tips of its ears and its glass-covered face was thrust forwards towards mine.  The smell of blood was thick in the air and I swallowed hard, dizzy with fear and nausea.  I could make out the hollow spot where its nose had once been and the corner of a lip, but the rest was a ruin of tattered flesh and shining pieces of glass.\n\nWhat did it want with me?  Why was it following me?  And why was it just standing here, inches away, doing nothing at all?\n\nI edged my foot sideways, thinking to slip away from it.  Maybe it couldn\u2019t see me.  But its head bobbed sideways too, following the movement.  I froze again.\n\nThen, slowly, it raised a hand.  I pressed hard against the door behind me, as if I could force my body through the wood and escape that way.  But that was impossible and there was nowhere to go as its blood-stained fingers came closer and closer.  I could see tiny slivers of glass embedded in the knuckles, the fingertips, protruding from underneath the fingernails.\n\nIt touched my cheek again.  Right near the bridge of the nose, underneath the eye.  I felt the rasp of glass as it traced the contour of my cheek sideways.\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut tight, because there was nowhere to go but inside myself, where I could drift away, far far away from what was happening to me.\n\n\u201cJames,\u201d a voice said sharply.\n\nThe touch vanished in an instant.  My eyes shot open.\n\nProfessor Monotone stood in the hallway, right behind the stabbed student.  He looked angry, his brow furrowed and his hands balled into fists.  It was the first time I\u2019ve seen any kind of emotion on him.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, James,\u201d the professor said.\n\nAnd the ghost leapt for the ceiling.  It went straight up, landing on all fours and clinging to the ceiling panels like some kind of insect.  I stared at Professor Monotone, speechless, as he watched the ghost scuttle away and around the corner.  He sighed deeply once it was out of sight.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said gruffly.\n\nHe fished in a pocket and produced a handkerchief.  I didn\u2019t even realize I was crying.  I mopped frantically at my face.  I had to calm down.  I had to stop breathing so fast.\n\n\u201cY-you know who that is?\u201d I gasped.\n\n\u201cWas,\u201d Professor Monotone corrected with a sigh.  \u201cHe was a student here about ten years ago.  I was thinking of recommending him for the graduate program but he died shortly before graduation.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did he die?\u201d I whispered.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.  They never found the body and officially he\u2019s just \u2018missing\u2019.  But then that ghost started showing up and the timing\u2026 the location\u2026 made me think it was James.\u201d\n\nIt had reacted to the name.  I felt somewhat elated, or perhaps that was the adrenaline.  I had a name.  This was the first ghost on campus that I could confirm was definitely the ghost of a dead student and I had a name for them.\n\n\u201cI should go talk to Professor L.,\u201d he mumbled.  \u201cI wonder what changed.\u201d\n\n\u201cT-there\u2019s a stone he has,\u201d I said.  \u201cA piece of petrified wood.  Ask him if he still has it.\u201d\n\nProfessor Monotone didn\u2019t reply.  He looked at me for a moment with those tired eyes and then he walked away, leaving me clutching his handkerchief and trying to regain my composure before anyone else came down the corridor.\n\nI hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d been crying in the moment, but I think\u2026 when James reached for my face\u2026 he wasn\u2019t trying to scare me.\n\nHe was wiping away a tear.\n\n(also if anyone has ideas for getting Professor Monotone\u2019s handkerchief back to him without it being super awkward and weird I would really appreciate it kthanks)[\\[x\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)\n\n[Keep reading.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13r7xl0/how_to_survive_college_the_library_enforces_its/)\n\n[Read the first draft of the rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/t34mbv/how_to_survive_college/)\n\n[Visit the college's website.](https://alderrayne.com/)",

You could\u2019ve asked anything, about Greyson, the Principal, Admin etc. Even if he didn\u2019t respond or give you what you wanted, the way he reacted to one of those types of questions could\u2019ve been foretelling. Or asked what the wood is! and why it seemingly repels inhumans. Or if he was down for a multi-part answer; how many inhumans are on campus and what rules they have/how to avoid them.",

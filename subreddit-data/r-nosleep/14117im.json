    "postText": "\u201cI just had an idea pop into my head about something to do this coming weekend, and I wanted to bounce it off you two before it slips my mind\u201d My friend Natasha said those words as the three of us sat on my couch one afternoon. I found myself sitting up slightly. Normally, Natasha was the last of our group to suggest things to do, letting Vinny, the third member of our group, or I come up with the plans to keep our free time occupied. The fact she was about to suggest something intrigued me. \u201cWhat have you got in mind?\u201d I asked her. A smile played over her face as her brown eyes seemed to flash. \u201cHow about a little ghost hunting?\u201d\r  \n\t\r  \nI felt Vinny sit straight up beside me. She had clearly grabbed both our attention now. The three of us were what you might call amateur ghost hunters, using very basic items we bought offline to visit some of the spookier places in the area and posting our adventures on YouTube, sort of like a crappier version of *Ghost Adventures*. \u201cNow *that\u2019s* one hell of a good idea\u201d Vinny said, before a puzzled expression spread over his face. \u201cBut, I mean, where? We\u2019ve already done most of the places around town. The Tioga building won\u2019t let us in after that\u2026well, what that one resident claims we stirred up in the old ballroom, and I\u2019m not about to make the hours long drive to the Wolf Creek Inn\u201d Natasha\u2019s smile grew wider. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t have to even go out of town for this one\u201d she said, her voice dropping low, \u201cWhat I\u2019m suggesting, is we check out\u2026\u201d her voice trailed off, letting the suspense grow for a few seconds before finishing, \u201cThe Egyptian Theatre\u201d\r  \n\r  \nInstantly, Vinny let out a harsh bark of laughter. \u201cHA! Now *that\u2019s* a good one. You know damn good and well that the society that runs the theater won\u2019t allow us in after hours to ghost hunt. As far as I know, they\u2019ve never allowed *any* paranormal teams into the place\u201d He pulled a face. \u201cSo, how exactly do you propose we get in there? You flutter your eyelashes for the night janitor and use your feminine charms to get us in?\u201d Natasha still grinned, but rolled her eyes at our friend\u2019s quip. \u201cNo, actually, I was thinking about using my lock picking skills to get us in\u201d she declared. It was my turn to give her an incredulous look. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d I asked. She shook her head. \u201cNope, I\u2019m dead serious\u201d I let out an incredulous, almost baffled snort of laughter and pulled my glasses off my face, rubbing my eyes.\r  \n\r  \nThe country, and, to a large extent, the entire world, became gripped in an interest, sometimes bordering on obsession with all things Egyptian when King Tut\u2019s tomb was discovered over a century ago. Many things came out of this, including the classic 1932 monster movie *The Mummy*. But, one thing that also came of this fever gripping the country was a desire to build many Egyptian style buildings. And one of the buildings which took this design and ran with it, were the movie theatres. A decade after the legendary discovery, over a hundred theatres had gone up all around the country, their interiors clad with fake temple columns, paintings of sphinxes and Egyptian gods such as Anubis decorating the walls, and hieroglyphs adorning the archways. People flocked in droves to them, both to watch movies, and live performances. But, like all trends, eventually, the interest began to wane, and as the late 20th Century approached, many began to shut down and be either remodeled, or straight up demolished. Today, there\u2019s only between five and eight Egyptian style theatres left in the entire country.\r  \n\r  \nAnd one just so happens to be right in the town I live in.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I moved to Coos Bay, Oregon nine years ago, I immediately fell in love with the place. Even though it\u2019s the largest coastal town on the Oregon coast, it\u2019s a place which is more or less perpetually frozen in time, still looking pretty much as it did between thirty and seventy years ago. And, as someone who is not exactly into the modern world, it made a perfect place for me to live and escape away from the 21st Century. I began exploring right away, driving every street of it and the town neighboring it, North Bend, along with walking every alley and back road I could to learn the layout. That\u2019s how I learned about the supernatural element to the town.\r  \n\r  \nThere are many places in town which people claim supernatural occurrences take place. From the remains of the old logging buildings on the estuary, to the old Tioga Hotel which has been remodeled into apartments, there is no shortage of ghostly tales. There was even the old McCauley Hospital, which had once been the focal point of the town\u2019s annual ghost walks until it was demolished in 2018. As a side note, I heard a rumor that a couple people broke into that place right before it got torn down. Something sure spooked them, because a friend of mine on the police force told me they gave him a fright, bursting in the night before Easter and rambling about something. I always wondered what they saw in there.\r  \n\r  \nBut, for me, the place in town I always loved the most, and enjoyed the most hearing about the ghostly accounts told, was the Egyptian Theatre.\n\n \r  \nOriginally built as a garage in 1922, it was renovated by a man named Charles Noble into a movie theatre in 1925, where it drew in droves of people from around the area to watch films, and enjoy live vaudeville performances. It continued to operate almost to the end of the 20th Century, when other theatres began to attract younger moviegoers, and for a while, it almost seemed as though the historic building might even be closed for good and gutted. But, thanks to the efforts of local preservation societies, it was saved, and now operates as a theatre once again. They mostly play only older movies, along with live performances.\r  \n\r  \nAnd, of course, it draws curious people for the paranormal rumors surrounding it.\r  \n\r  \nFor years, people have reported strange occurrences happening inside the building, both when it\u2019s open, and after hours. Patrons and employees alike have spoken about a pervasive feeling of being watched inside the building, but finding no one there when the place was searched. There have been reports of being touched by invisible hands, a few even pushed slightly. Beyond physical interaction, employees have reported the sounds of old film projectors playing and unseen audiences laughing after hours, along with the eerie playing of the theatre\u2019s Wurlitzer pipe organ, along with a host of other occurrences. No ghost hunting team has ever gone in to try and document these events. And to Natasha, *that* was too good of an opportunity to pass up. Legal, or not.\r  \n\r  \n \u201cAre you freaking *nuts*?!\u201d Vinny exclaimed, \u201cDo you have any idea how much trouble we\u2019d be in if we got caught breaking and entering? The cops around here are already a bit twitchy with the druggies and the homeless. You wanna give them a reason to throw us into jail alongside them?\u201d Natasha held up a finger, flipping her black hair over her shoulder. \u201cThey won\u2019t find out, because I have not one, but two aces in the hole here. The first is that thanks to being friends with Scott, I know the nighttime police sweeps, where they\u2019re going to be and everything. There\u2019ll be an hour long window where they\u2019re not anywhere near the alley where the back door to the theatre is. We can get in and out with no threat of being spotted at all. And the second is, did you forget I\u2019m dating Dylan now?\u201d The realization washed over me like a wave; she had started dating the man who helped the preservation society run the theatre a month or so ago. *Damn, she\u2019s been planning this one for a while*, I thought.\r  \n\r  \nVinny had a thoughtful look on his face, his green eyes darting around rapidly, but not seeing. \u201cHmm\u201d he muttered, then looked at Natasha. \u201cAnd you\u2019re *sure* that there\u2019s no chance of us getting caught?\u201d he asked slowly. \u201cAbsolutely none\u201d she said, then looked at both of us. \u201cSo, how about it?\u201d For a few moments, there was silence, and then Vinny let out a chuckle. \u201cWhat the hell, why not? The most exciting thing we\u2019ve done the last few weeks is go down to the farmer\u2019s market. This could shake things up a bit\u201d I suddenly became aware that the two of them were looking at me, waiting for me to make my decision. I was always the most sensible of the three of us, doing all I could to keep us out of trouble with others as well as the law. But, I always had one nasty Achilles Heel ever since I had been a child, and that was peer pressure. So, despite the overwhelming feeling that I should tell them no, that I should say we should just find something else to do, I nodded. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s do it\u201d I said simply, causing grins to break out on both of my friend\u2019s faces.\r  \n\r  \nI wish to God in retrospect that I\u2019d just had the damn spine to stand up and say \u201cNo\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe rest of the week seemed to pass by faster than usual. Before I knew it, the weekend had arrived. We\u2019d decided that late Saturday night would be the best time to do this, as most places downtown closed up between eleven and midnight, aside from the bars and strip club. To say I felt anxious about breaking the law, something I wasn\u2019t used to doing at all, would be like calling a Megalodon a goldfish, but my worries about disappointing my friends ended up outweighing it. And so, at eleven-thirty, the three of us piled into my beat up Chevy Tahoe, and made our way towards downtown. As I drove us down Ocean Boulevard, which connected the two sides of town, something settled over me. I can\u2019t exactly place it, even to this day. But it was the most uneasy feeling I\u2019ve ever experienced. But I did my best to push it away. *It\u2019s nothing, Troy. It\u2019s just because you\u2019re, understandably, worried about this. Plus, the road being deserted isn\u2019t helping much*.\r  \n\r  \nMy mental chiding seemed to help center me a bit, which was a good thing. The road was now angling downward, and a moment later, we drove into downtown. The darkened shapes of the closed stores seemed to rise up higher on either side of us than they looked during the daytime. We\u2019d decided to cruise by the front entrance first, just to see if anyone were still inside. As I turned the truck onto the main drag, the sign for the theatre rose high above us, a depiction of an Egyptian pharaoh next to the yellow and white letters which proclaimed its name to everyone who drove through town. I spared a glance as we passed it. The lit up marquee windows showed that *The Blues Brothers* and *Jaws* would be shown soon. For whatever reason, though, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to look through the glass doors that showed the building\u2019s darkened interior. The uneasy feeling had returned, and, for a moment, it felt as though if I *did* look, I would see someone, or something staring back out at me. And then we passed it, taking the next right and looping back around to Anderson Ave.\r  \n\r  \nI turned the truck into the narrow alley drive which ran along the back of the theatre and neighboring buildings. Parking right next to the rear doors would be extremely conspicuous, so I pulled up a bit further and parked in a carport like area. Shutting off the engine, I turned to my two friends. \u201cWell, this is it\u201d I said, \u201cLast chance to turn back if anyone\u2019s having second thoughts\u201d I\u2019d hoped that either Vinny or Natasha would\u2019ve gotten cold feet in the last few minutes, allowing us to go do something else. But there was no such luck. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Natasha said from the passenger seat, \u201cWe are *far* too close to back out now!\u201d Vinny grunted from behind me. *Well, shit*. Resigning myself to the fact they were determined to go through with this, I let a deep breath out through my nose and nodded. The others opened their doors and hopped out. A moment later, I followed.\r  \n\r  \nThe night air was cool and crisp on my skin as we slowly walked back down the alley to the rear of the yellow-ish, tan building. Three different sets of red double doors were built into the back of the theatre. Natasha pulled something out of her coat pocket, and I realized, with a small pang of surprise, that it was a lock pick set. A legitimate lock pick set. \u201cWhere the hell did you get that?\u201d I whispered to her. She shrugged and smiled. \u201cI have my ways of getting things\u201d she said simply, then pointed to the far right set of doors. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a bit of cover from that electrical box. You two keep an eye out while I deal with the lock\u201d And with that, she scurried forward, bending down in front of the door handles. Vinny and I stood guard, each of us looking down both ends of the alley. As the soft sound of Natasha messing with the lock filtered over to me, I realized just how quiet it was. And how eerie hearing downtown so quiet was. Aside from a few distant *booms* and *bangs*, and the far off sound of a dog barking, all I could hear was the whistle of the wind as it whipped between the old buildings.\r  \n\r  \nAn involuntary shiver cascaded up my spine, and I tried again to reason myself back to a relative sense of calm. \u201cGet a grip, dude, you\u2019re gonna be fine\u201d I whispered under my breath. But this time, it felt as though I weren\u2019t able to entirely convince myself. I suddenly became aware of a creeping sensation, one which made me shoot a look around. Nothing moved in the stillness, no indication of anyone besides us being in the alley. And, yet\u2026I was overcome with the distinct feeling of being watched. Not by either of my friends. But\u2026by someone *else*. Before I had a chance to even think about it, I heard a rather loud *click*, and Natasha let out a soft laugh of triumph. \u201cWe\u2019re in, ladies and gentleman!\u201d she declared, standing up and pulling on the door. It opened silently, the streetlight in the alley casting a small shaft of light into the darkness beyond. Turning, she waved an arm at Vinny and I. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get inside\u201d\r  \n\r  \nBefore either of us could say anything, she turned and disappeared into the dark. I shot a look at Vinny, who simply shrugged. \u201cAfter you, my man\u201d he whispered. I let out a deep sigh, and then moved to the door. Reaching into my pocket, I pulled out the small flashlight, and then pulled on the heavy metal, slipping inside, Vinny right behind me. The darkness swallowed us as the door closed. For a moment, a small rush of panic from not being able to see flashed through me, before a light appeared beside me. It wasn\u2019t from a flashlight, though; instead, a small, orange flame flickered beside me. \u201cDon\u2019t turn on your flashlights yet, just follow me\u201d Natasha said, the flame making her face seem to dance and move behind it. She turned and headed away, leaving us no choice but to follow. I listened to her and didn\u2019t turn on my flashlight. But every fiber of my being was screaming at me to. Because the feeling of being watched out in the alleyway? Had quintupled in here. The best way to describe it, was that we were angrily being stared at. And I didn\u2019t like the sensation one bit.\r  \n\r  \nNatasha led us up a flight of steps and pushed open another door. \u201cWe\u2019re here\u201d she said, still keeping her voice low, \u201cYou can turn on your flashlights now\u201d *Thank you, God*, I silently said, snapping mine on and casting a bright white light into the room we\u2019d entered. A moment later, so did my two friends\u2019 lights. The beams played around, and I heard Vinny let out a bit of a gasp. \u201cHo-lyyyy shit\u201d he muttered.\r  \n\r  \nNatasha had guided us into the main theatre. The ceiling rose high above our heads, almost out of sight of even the flashlights. Rows upon rows of red movie seats stretched out and away from us, seeming almost unending in the shadows. The walls were all covered in hieroglyphs, all still original from the 1920s. To our left, the second story, which housed a smaller row of seats, along with the projection room rose about twenty feet above us. And to the right, was the stage itself. It was flanked by two huge columns, the screen rolled up and revealing a mosaic of an Egyptian building on the back wall, with two men clutching staffs sitting on either side. Directly in front of the stage sat the organ, its seating bench tucked beneath it.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOkay, this is a trip to be in at night!\u201d Natasha exclaimed excitedly, then pulled the backpack she\u2019d been wearing off her shoulders. Dropping it into a seat, she unzipped it and began pulling items from it. \u201cGuys, here\u201d she said, holding them out. Vinny stepped forward and grabbed the camcorder from her; as someone who\u2019d had a lifelong dream of being a filmmaker, he was our resident cameraman. I stepped forward and took two items from her: an infrared thermometer and an EVP recorder. The rest, she placed on the ground, and then faced Vinny. \u201cAlright, tell me when you\u2019re recording\u201d He fumbled with the camcorder for a second, then shot her a thumbs up. Instantly, she took on a somber, eerie expression, giving an admittedly creepy look at the camera. \u201cWell, well, welcome back to The Three Ghostkuteers, everyone. I hope you all have been well since our last trip. Tonight, you join us in a very, very special place, and one close to home for us. We are currently in the Egyptian Theatre in Coos Bay, Oregon, one of the last remaining in the country. It was built in the 1920s by a man named Charles Noble-\u201c\r  \n\r  \nI turned away, tuning her out as I did. *The woman really, really enjoys being in front of the camera. Better her than me*. Shining my light around, I looked up at the balcony. I could see the small hole in the projection booth where the movie projector would shine out onto the screen. Something caught the beam\u2019s light, reflecting off it slightly, and I aimed the light at the wall. It was a wrought iron light fixture, one which had been shaped into the figure of a King Cobra, poised to strike. Gazing around, I saw they adorned much of the walls. I let out a small shudder at it. *God, do I hate snakes*. Thankfully, though, the feeling of being watched I\u2019d had in the alley and the darkened back of the theatre had seemingly disappeared. *Yeah, see, what\u2019d I tell you, Troy? Nothing but your nerves*.\r  \n\r  \nNatasha had finished her opening monologue and moved to the edge of the stage, on which she placed the small, square spirit box. \u201cAnd now, let\u2019s see if anyone would like to speak with us\u201d she said, flicking it on. Instantly, the silence of the theatre was shattered by the sound of static, intermittently interrupted by quick snippets of radio shows being picked up. \u201cIs there anyone here who\u2019d like to talk to us?\u201d she called out into the huge room. The static and snippets were the only sound to answer her. After a minute, she tried again. \u201cAre there any spirits who\u2019d like to communicate with us?\u201d There was still nothing. Vinny panned the camera from the box to Natasha as she paced back and forth for a few minutes. A small look of disappointment flooded over her face, but she instantly plastered it over with the same look she\u2019d given the camera before. \u201cWell, it looks like the spirit box isn\u2019t gonna work tonight, so we\u2019re gonna have to try something else\u201d She pulled out an EVP recorder identical to mine and switched it on. \u201cLet\u2019s try this instead, shall we? Remember, by the way guys, if you\u2019re new here and want to see more, to like and subscribe-\u201c\r  \n \r  \nI turned away again, feeling a small pang of irritation flow through me. *This is freakin\u2019 ridiculous, man. The longer we stay in here, the more chance we have of getting caught*. Truth be told, as much as I enjoyed ghost hunting, I didn\u2019t even really believe in the paranormal. In all the years the three of us had filmed together, not once had we caught anything, on tape or otherwise. In fact, many times we\u2019d had to fake spooky occurrences in order to make sure our videos got any views at all. *This is your own fault, man*, I silently chided myself, *you\u2019re the one who couldn\u2019t stand up to them and say no. You really, seriously need to grown a spine and learn how to say no*. The mental self lecture was furthering my rotten mood, and I began to feel a wave of anger at my two friends, as well as myself boil up.\r  \n \r  \n\u201cHell with this\u201d I finally muttered, then turned and began walking up the aisle. \u201cTroy, where the hell are you going?\u201d I heard Natasha call out behind me. I stopped, not looking over my shoulder, but quietly aiming my voice behind me and allowing a hint of irritation to seep into it. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go check out the second floor balcony, okay? I don\u2019t exactly like just standing here\u201d For a moment, there was silence, and then her voice came, soft and almost apologetic. \u201cOkay, go ahead\u201d Before she could say anything more, I strode away, walking to the open doorway which led out of the theater and into the concession area. I hooded my flashlight beam with one hand to make sure it wouldn\u2019t accidentally shine out of the glass entrance doors into the street and looked around. The lobby and concession stand took up most of the front area, the darkened shape of it stretching along the far wall.\r  \n\r  \nTaking a few steps ahead, I turned and looked up at the wall above me. Large, blue letters stretched out from one side of it to the other. *Through these doors pass the most wonderful people.* I snorted softly. \u201cYeah, unfortunately, not tonight\u201d I shook my head, then looked around. And nearly jumped out of my skin. Something also seemed to jump back. I felt my heartbeat begin to race in my chest and my breath quickened. \u201cShit\u2026\u201d I let out weakly, then slowly moved forward. After a few steps, I suddenly realized what I\u2019d seen and let out a soft laugh of relief.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYour own damn reflection, you fucking pussy\u201d Shaking my head, I turned away from the glass wall and headed for the stairs to the second floor. At the base of them, I stopped and shone my flashlight up. \u201cOoh, boy\u201d I said quietly. Sitting next to the stairway like a sentry, was a huge, golden statue of a pharaoh. It towered over me, and I estimated that, were it be standing straight up, it\u2019d easily be between eight and ten feet tall. It stared straight ahead at the wall ahead of it, and I couldn\u2019t help but let out a small shiver as I stared at it. It just seemed so damn eerie in the dark, and I quickly moved past it, heading up the stairs and stepping out onto the second story balcony.\r  \n\r  \nI shone my light around. Red seats again surrounded me, though this time far fewer. Ahead of me, I could see the balcony\u2019s edge and the hulking shape of the main stage beyond. I could also see the beams of my friends\u2019 flashlights playing over it, and hear both of their voices speaking softly. Deciding while I was up here to at least check out the projection booth, I strode over to the door and tried to turn the handle. It was locked. Feeling my irritation bubble over into exasperation, I jiggled the handle in some stupid attempt to open it. But the door stayed shut. I turned away and rubbed my eyes, again hearing the voices of my friends softly filtering up to me from down below.\r  \n \r  \n\u201cHey, if there really *are* any ghosts, or spooks, or specters, or whatever in here? If you\u2019re actually real, could you appear to us, please?\u201d I whispered to no one, \u201cThat way my friends can get what they want and I can go home\u201d I received only silence in reply. I hadn\u2019t really expected anything, anyways. *You know what? Screw this, I\u2019m going back down there and telling them I\u2019m going home, with or without them. This is beyond stupid, I just broke the law for what? For nothing! For something dumb as hell.* And with that, I turned to walk away. But I hadn\u2019t even taken a single step when something crashed into me like a wave. The breath was driven from my lungs as I felt a massive chill shoot through me, as though I\u2019d been doused with ice water. \u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d I hissed through gritted teeth, then froze, my eyes going wide. The feeling of being watched had returned with a vengeance, and it had seemingly been ramped up in its intensity. I shot a look around, but saw nobody.\r  \n\r  \nStill, the feeling remained, and with each passing second, it almost seemed to grow stronger. Chill after chill rolled up my spine, and even though I didn\u2019t really believe, something deep inside me told me that it was time to get out. *Okay, time to leave*, I said in my head, and headed quickly for the stairs. As I reached the head, I turned to look back one final time. That\u2019s when I saw something. It disappeared when I aimed my flashlight at it, but I swear a second earlier it had been the outline of a person, standing in the shadows and watching me. The split second sight catapulted me into motion, and I hurried down the steps, shining my light every which way but loose. Believer or not, I knew something wanted us out. I\u2019d planned on jumping off the second to last stair and running for the main theatre floor. But as I reached the bottom, I froze.\r  \n\r  \nFor a moment, I couldn\u2019t place why. And then, the realization fell over me like a tsunami. I let out an involuntary gasp, and fear like I\u2019d never felt before surged through me. I didn\u2019t want to turn around and look. I wanted to pretend I hadn\u2019t seen it. I desperately wanted to. But, like a dumbass character in a horror movie, I couldn\u2019t help it. I *needed* to look. I slowly turned, aiming my flashlight back up. And I couldn\u2019t help but let out a strangled scream, falling backwards over my own feet as I began to backpedal rapidly.\r  \n\r  \nThe statue of the pharaoh still sat where it had. It still towered over me, looking as imposing and eerie as ever. But it\u2019s carved and painted eyes were no longer staring straight ahead at the wall. Instead, they had somehow moved. And when I\u2019d turned, I\u2019d come to find they were staring directly at *me*.\r  \n\r  \nI scrambled to my feet, snatching the flashlight from the floor where I\u2019d dropped it and aiming it at the statue again. It stared straight out at nothing again. But I knew what I\u2019d seen. It hadn\u2019t been a trick of my mind, or the light. The freaking thing\u2019s eyes had moved to watch me as I passed down by it. I began to stammer out as I backed away from it. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s it, no no no no, we\u2019re done here, fuck this shit, I\u2019m officially a believer, we\u2019re leaving, right now\u201d I kept backing towards the doorway to the theatre, never taking my eyes off the statue. I was terrified I\u2019d seen it suddenly stand up and turn to lumber after me like Boris Karloff or something.\r  \n\r  \nThe blaring sound of the theatre\u2019s organ slashed through the silence, causing me to let out another strangled scream and jump almost a foot off the ground. I whipped around, thinking I would see my moronic friends tinkering with the instrument. Instead, I froze again. The theatre was no longer dark. Both of my friends had seemingly vanished from the room, as I could no longer see them. The movie screen had somehow been pulled down, and above me, I heard the whir of the movie projector playing. An old, black and white movie, one which had no sound, played on the screen, occasionally changing to show dialogue being displayed in white letters.\r  \n\r  \nIt was also no longer empty.\r  \n\r  \nThe entire theatre was *packed*. I saw people sitting at almost every single seat in the huge room. I could only see the backs of their heads as they watched the movie playing. At the edge of the stage, what looked like a man now sat at the organ, playing it in time with the film. A slapstick moment came across the screen, and the audience began laughing. In any other situation, it would\u2019ve been a comforting sound. But at that moment, it was the most spine chilling sound I\u2019d ever heard. Especially as another wave of realization crashed into me. From the little I could see, everyone in the theatre looked to be dressed in long passed fashions.\r  \n \r  \nThat\u2019s when the voice, low and quiet, came from behind me. \u201cGood evening, sir\u201d it said. It sounded like a man\u2019s voice, one rather low and deep pitched, but something about it paralyzed me on the spot. The voice continued, putting on an air of pleasant politeness. \u201cWe\u2019re so glad you could make it, it\u2019s been so *long* since we\u2019ve had new patrons arrive at a showing. If I could just see your ticket, please?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nFor a moment, I couldn\u2019t speak. Then, I managed to squeak out two words. \u201cUh, ticket?\u201d The tone of the voice seemed to change somewhat. \u201cYes, your ticket. That\u2019s the only way you could\u2019ve gotten in. Please, let me verify it and show you to your seat\u201d *Ohhh, shit*. Whoever, or *whatever* the voice belonged to, thought I had shown up like a regular moviegoer. The voice\u2019s tone became less polite. \u201cYou *do* have a ticket, right, sir?\u201d I was beyond terrified to answer, but I was more terrified to remain silent. For a moment, I considered lying. But I feared what might happen if I did. So I told the truth.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2026.uh, I, uh\u2026.I don\u2019t have a ticket, sir\u201d I stammered out, my voice barely above a whisper. Instantly, all sound stopped in the room like someone had flipped a switch. \u201cYou\u2026don\u2019t have a ticket?\u201d the voice said, all pretense of manners vanishing from it, \u201cThen how did you get in here for the late night showing?\u201d *Oh, god*. I forced myself to speak, still unable to say anything except the truth. \u201cMy\u2026my friends and I\u2026.broke in\u2026through the back door\u2026to\u2026ghost hunt\u2026\u201d There was silence for a few moments, and then a heavy hand dropped onto my shoulder. My head swiveled to look at it. *Oh, fuck me sideways*. It wasn\u2019t a regular hand. It was a fucking *claw*. One with black skin, tipped with what looked like razor sharp nails. It sat there for a moment, then tightened; almost painfully so, making me let out a small whimper of pain.\r  \n\r  \nThat\u2019s when I looked up. Everyone in the theatre had turned to look at me. My initial thought had been correct; they all wore clothing from almost a century ago, and not the stuff cosplayers wear, either. They also had very angry expressions on their faces, as if they\u2019d just noticed the intruder among their midst. The voice finally came again, almost directly behind me. Its tone lowered, almost sounding guttural and animal, making my legs almost melt into jelly from the fear. \u201cThen, might I make a suggestion to you and your trespassing little friends?\u201d My breath came in rapid, ragged gasps, and I barely managed to force out the one word. \u201cYes?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cLEAVE\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAt the single word reply, which now more closely resembled a growl than a word, I did something I will forever wish I hadn\u2019t. I finally turned and looked up at who was addressing me. The only way I can describe what happened is, my mind shattered. The next thing I remember, I was crashing into the back doors of the theatre into the night.\r  \n\r  \nAnd I was screaming.\r  \n\r  \nThat was a month or so ago. When I\u2019d stumbled back into the alley, I\u2019d turned and, in what I can only call blind fear and panic, bolted for my truck. I hadn\u2019t even heard my friends chasing after me. Not until Vinny caught up to me as I scrambled with my keys, grabbing me from behind and turning me to face him. He said the look I\u2019d had on my face scared him and Natasha more than anything ever had before. I\u2019d been pale as a sheet, my eyes wider than they ever thought a human\u2019s could be. I'd been babbling softly. I\u2019d been saying the words \u201cThey want us to leave\u201d over and over. They didn\u2019t ask me what had happened. They just pushed me into the backseat of my truck and drove away from there. It was clear, as I found out later on, that both of them hadn\u2019t seen anything. As far as they were concerned before seeing me dash to the rear doors, it was just an empty theatre. Neither one of them ever asked me what I saw that night. And for that, I\u2019m thankful. Because I could never utter from my lips what I *did* see.\r  \n \r  \nBut I\u2019ve had nightmares since then. Horrible ones. Ones that\u2019ve been so bad, I had to let out what happened to me, deciding to just post it here, regardless of whether people believe me or not.\r  \n\r  \nNightmares about being back in that theatre after hours. About seeing that pharaoh statue\u2019s eyes flick in its painted sockets to look at me. About seeing all those people, people long since dead, sitting and watching the films they did when they were alive. About seeing that hand fall on my shoulder, hearing that voice, telling me not to come back until I have a ticket.\r  \n\r  \nAnd about turning to see who the hand and voice belonged to.\r  \n\r  \nThe Egyptian Theatre will be celebrating its centennial this year. People are planning to show up in 1920s cars, dressed in period clothing. They\u2019re even going to show an old, silent film as part of the festivities. But I won\u2019t be attending it. I won\u2019t ever go anywhere near it again. The one time I tried, a week or so ago, I started trembling with fear. And the mental image played over and over in my head.\r  \n\r  \nThe image of turning to see that horrible canine head attached to the human-like body, red, glowing eyes glaring down at me as it\u2019s sharp teeth glinted in the light.\r  \n\r  \nI pray to god I never *will* end up with a ticket to one of its late night showings.\r  \n\r  \nBut I can't help but fear that, like those packed into the theatre, sooner or later, we *all* will.",

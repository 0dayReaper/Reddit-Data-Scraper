Each second of staying awake, more agonizing than the last, feels like a constant battle with my own body. Thirty minutes more. I just need thirty minutes more until this weird concoction finishes brewing. Everyone looks so skinny already...\n\nEveryone was in slightly better spirits once we found and skimmed through Ramirez's Journal. I call it a journal, but it would be more accurate to call it a full-fledged novel, given how thick it actually is. Leather bound, a small string wraps around it to keep it closed. Untying it reveals hundreds of thin, yellow pages, all imprinted with an elegant handwriting. Reading the initial passage, we went through it, looking for any additional mentions of this Garden and subscription pass Ramirez was looking for.\n\n\"Nothing on how to find either of them...\" I said, feeling slightly dejected.\n\n\"So far at least.\" replied Marie, trying to cheer me up a little. \"This thing is huge enough already, maybe we haven't looked enough.\"\n\n\"Still,\" added John, scratching his chin, \"if what this man wrote here is accurate, that means we're finally gonna be safe.\"\n\n\"Bah,\" said Matt in the background, \"to me, it sounds like a bunch of hooey, spewed by a man who lost touch with reality. A lush, purple garden going for hundreds of thousands of carts, full of fruits hanging from vines, animals that walk around and a river of fresh water? A subscription pass that would make the Conductor leave you be for the rest of your life? Non-sense, all of it!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't dismiss the idea so easily,\" said Helen. \"We've seen stranger things in this place.\"\n\n\"That, we did, but keep in mind, all these things tried to kill us in the past, and now you're telling me there are good things around here? I seriously doubt it.\"\n\n\"It doesn't hurt to be more optimistic from time to time now does it, Matt?\" asked Emily.\n\n\"I just don't want us chasing after what might as well be ghosts, is all.\"\n\n\"Regardless of these things being true or not,\" I butted back into the conversation, looking through the dusty pages of the journal, \"this thing looks like it has so much information on everything! I see some of the monsters we met, I see new ways to get and cook food... \"\n\n\"True enough,\" Matt nodded, \"can't say this is a completely useless find.\"\n\n\"If I may, I would rather start moving,\" spoke up Emily, \"I don't want to fall asleep next to our friend over there\", pointing towards the skeleton.\n\n\"Agreed,\" said John. \"We still need to find more food and tickets... How many do we have left?\"\n\n\"With the stuff we found along the way and the stockpile Jaques forced me to carry,\" replied Nick, \"we have thirty tickets right now.\"\n\n\"That would mean three days for all of us... Not that great.\" said Matt.\n\n\"But not that terrible either.\" I said.\n\n\"Can we do one last thing before we go?\" joined in Gertrude, saying her first words ever since we got chased by the Janitor.\n\n\"And what would that be?\" I asked.\n\n\"I didn't understand everything you said, dear, but from what I did, this man has been through a lot. We have taken something from him as well, so I suggest that we should do something for him too.\"\n\n\"What can we do for him? He doesn't look like he needs anything right now.\" said Matt sarcastically.\n\n\"Oh, you, I meant we can leave him in a nicer way. Say a prayer in his name, thanking him for letting us take his book.\"\n\n\"I suppose we could do that... If the conductor find us here or several carts ahead, it would be the same thing, but I don't exactly see a place we can bury him.\"\n\n\"We can lay him down and put his jacket over his head\" I added.\n\n\"I can also say a funerary prayer.\" said Nick. \"My father was a bishop, so I can help with that.\"\n\n\"That is wonderful, dear.\" said Gertrude, picking up Nick's hand. \"I am sure he would've been proud of you, seeing how you've grown up as such a helpful young man.\"\n\nNick slightly blushed from the sudden compliments, but he was appreciative nonetheless.\n\nMatt and John moved Ramirez's skeleton, placing him in the middle of the cart. Removing the jacket he was wearing, they put it on his head, covering his skull. Afterwards, they put his backpack on his chest, placing his hands on top of it. Once it was done, we gathered around Ramirez, Nick beginning his prayer as we bowed our heads.\n\n\"We have gathered around here, in this accursed subway, to commemorate one of our fallen brothers in Christ. We may have not met him, thus not knowing if he was a follower of God. But regardless of his faith or his character, we can all attest that he was a resourceful man. A resilient man. A kind man. For not only has he survived and documented all that he could about this plane of existence, hoping that if he was not fortunate enough to find a way out, he hoped that someone would find and take his knowledge. Thusly, we can commend him for reaching out from the beyond, handing us this trove of knowledge. Let his soul, wherever it may be, rest in peace. Amen.\"\n\n\"Amen\" we all said.\n\nAs we departed, we had one last look at the man who threw us a silver lining, leaving the cart that served as his grave and began walking. Although, as I closed the cart, I couldn't help but notice a small, dark mist hovering above him. I think, however, it was just my imagination.\n\nDespite the morbid circumstances of what just happened, everyone was in a slightly better mood. Gertrude was talking with Nick about his church life, with Helen and Matt listening in. John and Emily were walking together, holding hands, as they watched the twins talking to me and Marie about the outside world, all four of us being in the front. With my phone at 70%, I couldn't afford to use any battery intensive apps, so I showed them pictures on my gallery, hoping to cheer them up a little bit.\n\n\"And this is the beach we used to go on our holiday breaks.\"\n\n\"Wow,\" marveled Gabriel, \"there are so many people!\"Why is everyone in their underwear though? Mom said we should always wear clothes and not walk around naked.\" said Michael\n\n\"You see,\" answered Marie, \"that is not actually underwear, but special clothes made for the beach. We needed that so we could swim in the ocean!\"\n\nBoth of them looked confused at us.\n\n\"Right, I forgot.\" Scratching my back a bit, I began explaining.\n\n\"You see, there are places where there is a lot of water. Sooo much water in fact, that people began to move and play in it.\"\n\n\"And was it fun?\" asked Gabriel.\n\n\"You bet it was!\" said Marie excitedly. \"Jumping in, playing games, relaxing in it. So many memories...\"\n\nUpon hearing that, Michael rushed back to his parents.\n\n\"Once we're out, can we go the beach too? I want to go to the beach!\"\n\nJohn put his hand on Michael's hair and ruffled it a bit, giving him a big smile.\n\n\"Sure we will, kid. And we're gonna teach you two how to swim, how to make sand castles, how to-\"\n\n\"What are sand castles?\" Gabriel interrupted him. Michael and Gabriel were now listening to John, leaving me and Marie to ourselves.\n\n\"We're gonna get out, right?\" asked Marie.\n\n\"To be honest with you, I don't know. But,\" I said, raising Ramirez's journal, \"this is the best hope we have so far.\"\n\n\"In that case, let's look through it more carefully then.\"\n\nWe both began reading through the journal. After the initial passage, Ramirez began with a short summary of who he is, claiming to be a geographer who got stuck in here in the year 2000. A man who lived alone, he spent most of his time traveling the world, gathering data for his next study. Once in this subway however, all he did was move from place to place, documenting everything he could. It was meticulously separated in the following sections: Creatures, Food, Rumors. His first entry in the Creature section was about the Conductor.\n\nWhat greeted us was two very detailed drawings of the Conductor. One was in its \"normal\" form, showing it in a bowing, polite pose, having its abnormally long arm outstretched as if it was waiting for  tickets. The other one was in its true form, showing the Conductor posing with its back bent in a very sharp angle, sprouting tentacles and mouths all over its body. Both drawings occupied an entire page each. To be honest, I didn't know which one was more unnerving.\n\nAfter general information, such as how you can detect when its nearby and to never, ever give it a counterfeit ticket, the next entry was that of the Janitor.\n\nIn stark contrast to the Conductor, who even in its true form could be described as somewhat orderly, the Janitor was drawn chaotically. In the middle of the entirely black page, the only still drawing stood in the middle of it. A crouching humanoid figure, trembling and jittering, surrounded by a multitude of other figures, jumping, screaming, yelling, crying. If the Conductor was faceless, the Janitor had five crimson red eyes and three mouths, filled with jagged teeth, going around it's head.\n\nThankfully, as with the Conductor, there were signs of how to detect when the Janitor was coming. Beyond the smell of salt, which if you smell it, it might be too late for you to save yourself, another surefire sign that it was coming was if the Conductor has \"fined\" someone. Using a substance that gives a salty smell, the Janitor cleans and replaces everything in a darkened cart back to it's original form, for a range of one hundred carts, with the middle being the black pool left by the Conductor. Any living thing caught in the crossfire is said to be paralyzed and turned slowly into the substance, but Ramirez admits here that this is just his speculation, as there are no living people that got caught by the Janitor to further tell what really happened.\n\n\"So far, so good, now next is-\"\n\n\"Hey you two!\" yelled Helen from the back, \"We're setting camp here!\"\n\nMe and Marie returned to the rest of the group, leaving the Journal on one of the nearby chairs. It was kinda odd however, because I almost could've swore that the chairs were far more softer than usual.\n\nOnce everyone had their fill of rat meat, John pulled me aside for a while.\n\n\"Here, kid,\" he said, giving me another ring, \"told you my wife would be ok with it. Hell, when she heard my idea, I had to stop her from making too much noise. Wouldn't want to spoil the surprise now, would we?\"\n\nI thanked him profusely for the rings, putting both of them safely in my inner pocket. Once we returned, everyone was setting up for the \"night.\" I was selected as the Conductor watch, and so, I gave Marie one last good night kiss and set up shop for the next several hours.\n\nThe first odd thing that I began to notice is how fast everyone fell asleep. Normally, the twins would still be playing around for a little bit, but now, they almost instantly fell asleep. After that, I noticed the plastic chairs were unusually comfortable. I felt like they were molded just for me to sit in. And the wall, the wall felt like the softest pillow I ever laid my head on. With my eyelids feeling heavy, I was struggling to stay awake. Eventually, I closed my eyes for just a second, no more than a blink of the eye. In that blink, I saw a pair of pale white dots looking at me from outside the window...\n\n\"Mister Carter,\" I heard a familiar, monotone voice calling my name, \"if you do not find my presentation riveting enough, I would prefer if you would, at the very least, fall asleep in the back of the class.\"\n\nI raised my head, confused, making direct eye contact with Mister Thompson, before quickly pulling my gaze away.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said halfheartedly, not being sure of what was going on. \"Won't happen again...\"\n\nHe just pressed his lips and went back to teaching.\n\n\"Hey, are you okay?\" asked Marie, who was sitting, next to me. She pinched me a little bit to get my attention, but weirdly, I didn't feel it.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm... I'm fine...\" I said. She just caressed my back a little bit and started paying attention to the lecture.\n\nI kept wondering: Why was I back? How? Was all of it just a nightmare? It can't be. It felt so real... Matt, John, everyone, did I just imagine them? These questions have bothered me all through the lecture. Once we were done, I kept hanging out with Marie and our friends, and eventually, I arrived home. Mom and dad were waiting for me to start dinner. That was surprising, I thought, since dad was away for work and mom didn't wait for me if I arrived late. No point in wasting fresh food and all. I didn't complain though. For the rest of the day, I just played video games and relaxed, finally managing to beat that one annoying level I've been stuck in for ages.\n\nDays became weeks and weeks turned to months. Everything was going very smoothly on my end. My grades were improving, I was way more confident, my social skills kept getting better and better... Even Mr Thompson began appreciating my effort. Not to mention, my relationship with Marie was becoming even sweeter, spending more and more time together. Soon enough, I've forgotten everything about the subway, chalking it off to some weird thing I ate and being tired.\n\nDecades passed. I graduated, I found a high paying job and I even managed to start family with Marie. We lived in a mansion now, spending most of our days watching our children grow up. Everything was just right. My life was finally perfect, feeling like heaven came down to earth...\n\nI felt a sudden jerk, followed by strong shiver all throughout my body. I opened my eyes, and all I could see was the same, monotonous, subway cart. I was in total disbelief. Surely, I fell asleep while watching the kids and had a nightmare. I hit myself really hard, hoping to make myself up. Sure enough, it didn't work. I felt a very strong pain where I hit myself, a pain I haven't felt in a long time.\n\nSuddenly, I realized something. Me getting out of here, building my perfect life, it was all fake. Imaginary. I broke down in tears, thinking that I would never actually get out of here.\n\nOnce I couldn't shed any more tears, I looked around. Everyone else was fast asleep, although they looked a lot thinner than usual. Marie especially, all her muscle mass looking like it was drained from her. Even I, when I looked at my hands, saw they were skeletal looking. Panic began to set in, but then I finally noticed something else. In the cart with us, there was something else. something that I can only characterize as black, transparent mist, floating to my left.\n\nI kept staring at it, not knowing what it was, when the mist moved towards one of the windows. Following with my eyes, I looked outside, thinking I'd see the same the pitch black void that was always there.\n\nAnd it was there. The scary part it was that it wasn't the only thing outside. For a moment, it looked as if we were traveling through the night's sky, millions upon millions of pale white dots outside. Once I moved however, I realized that those millions of stars followed my movement. They weren't stars. They were eyes.\n\nI screamed as loud as possible, trying to hide away from the gazes from the dark, but everyone else still slept. I went and shook everyone, I yelled, I hit the windows, hoping that they would wake up. Nothing. All slept, all mumbling about something or other, like Helen saying she won a cooking competition or Matt finally signing that billion dollar deal.\n\nThe mist began moving again. Slowly, it stopped near Ramirez's Journal. That's when it hit me: Ramirez might've known something. I rushed to the chair I left it, trying as hard as possible to stay awake. Reaching it, I began flipping over the pages, not noticing at the time that the mist was slowly evaporating.\n\nPages and pages after, creatures upon creatures, I finally found what I was looking for. Both pages were dark, with the exception of hundreds of small dots sprinkled throughout the drawing, and written in bold letters on the top center of the pages: Sleep Watchers.\n\nThe next page gave more details: \"One of the more insidious creatures I encountered throughout my journey were the sleep watchers. No one knows what they look like, beyond the dots staring at you from outside of the  subway. However, everyone who has heard of them or, God forbid, encountered them, will say the same things.\n\nFirstly, everything in the cart stalked by them feels incredibly comfortable to the touch, as if they entered one big bed. Afterwards, once you stayed for more than thirty minutes in the cart, you begin to feel exhausted, as if you ran several marathons. The sudden exhaustion, coupled with the softness surrounding you, will prompt you to fall asleep immediately, and that is when you're caught in their trap.\n\nThey begin to feed you with pleasant dreams, dreams related to your biggest hopes and desires, keeping you further asleep. In the meantime, they feed off of your life, slowly draining you. The dreams, told from the people that woke up, could feel like decades, even if the process of draining only takes several days. Once you finally die in your dream, your life was entirely drained by the sleep watchers. Some say that the sleep watchers were previous victims, but I have yet to confirm this theory, which I will elaborate more on the rumors section.\n\nIt is impossible under normal circumstances to wake up once the dream begins. Thankfully however, after years of study, I have managed to create a concoction that should neutralize the effect of the sleep watchers. It isn't the tastiest, but once awake, the sleep watchers stop feeding, with your energy returning to you in a matter of days, with some slight variations regarding the victim, such as age, gender and muscle composition. The recipe for the concoction is noted on the next page. As for how best to avoid them, the easiest strategy is to just pay attention to your surroundings. If you suddenly feel tired and that everything around you is soft, you know you're stalked. They are numerous, but luckily, they are also very impatient. If you're being stalked and they can't get you to fall asleep within an one hour, they will leave. If you or anyone around you falls asleep however, they will remain there until all the sleeping people have been drained, attempting to succumb the rest as well. If you follow my recipe and wake everyone up, they will be annoyed and leave you immediately.\"\n\nI flipped over the page and saw that the recipe was as follows:\n\n\"1 bottle of water, 1/3rd of an once of orange mold, grown near the windows, 2/3rds of an ounce of blue rust from the cold pipe and 1/3rd of red rust from the hot pipe. Mix all the ingredients in the bottle and boil it for 1 hour. Two gulps for each person asleep is enough to wake them up.\"\n\nWith that, struggling to remain awake, I took Helen's knife and I looked all around for the ingredients mentioned. Thankfully, they were all within three carts of walking. Both types of rust were behind their respective pipes while there was just enough orange mold to take back. Once back, I took the kettle we found on the way, mixed everything and began waiting, all the while the sleep watchers were looking at me.\n\nSince I began writing, the final thirty minutes have passed and now the concoction is ready. It smells awful, but hopefully it will work. Once we're out of this mess, I will dedicate myself to reading and studying every bit of the journal. Wish me luck.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13xvigd/while_stuck_in_the_infinite_subway_the_biggest/)",

    "postText": "The moon shines in the sliding door window. I\u2019m sleepy, but not groggy. It\u2019s natural for me to wake up like this in the night sometimes. My foot itches. I roll my head to the right. I\u2019m always closer to the window than her. The bedsheet tugs just a little against my skin as her chest rises. She breathes in and out slowly, still asleep. I usually draw the blinds, but I must have forgotten to last night. I should scratch my foot, which itches, and draw the blinds, and then I can go back to sleep. I go to heave myself up, but something\u2019s weird. My foot feels numb, but like it got pricked as I started to move it just now, but not like the pins and needles when your foot falls asleep. A splinter or something, I guess. I stop and slide myself forward, minding my foot, and fold the sheet off myself, slowly, carefully, leaving it on her. There\u2019s a bunch of straw stuck to my foot- no, it\u2019s sticking out of my foot.\n\n  \nThere\u2019s straw sticking out of a perfectly cut oval hole in the bottom of my foot. It\u2019s a little bigger than half as long and half as wide as my foot. I almost gasp, but stop before I make any noise. It doesn\u2019t feel like anyone\u2019s still here though, it wouldn\u2019t make sense. And even if I did make a sound, it\u2019s them\u2014 I breathe shallow and feel up my leg. Everything under the ankle is numb. I try, but I can\u2019t get my toes to move even a little, and it\u2019s totally numb. I don\u2019t want to mess with the straw, I need a doctor. I don\u2019t want it to start bleeding. Where is the blood? There\u2019s no blood on the sheets, there\u2019s not even any blood at the edge of the skin where the straw comes out. How long did this take to do? In the night lighting I finally notice the color of my foot. There\u2019s no blood red, but it\u2019s not pale either\u2026 I don\u2019t go outside much. My skin is almost translucent, and so the straw color shows through under what it\u2019s stuffed in. I go to try and bend my big toe with my hand. Everything was taken out first. No joints, no bone, there\u2019s just straw that strains and starts to fold. I can feel it, even hear it under the skin. I bend more and watch my big toe fold limply, misshapen now.\n\n  \nI know what this is. I don\u2019t know if she got punished too. She\u2019s asleep still. My heart is pounding in my chest, the air feels too dry as I slowly, carefully peel the bedsheet off her, dreading it as I look over her body. If she wakes up, I will be there, if they did something, I will be there. But I don\u2019t want her to wake up yet, I want to just get myself under control so I can be there. We\u2019ll leave right now, tonight. I hover over her to look at the other side of her now, there\u2019s nothing. I look around the room, I almost say something. But no one\u2019s here. It\u2019s done. I almost laugh, but it\u2019s nervous, I feel like I got off easy. I sit still for a moment, I\u2019ll get ready to go. \u2026but I want to wrap myself around her first. She breathes in and out slowly against me. I nestle my head into hers. I\u2019m crying, silently, in relief. Relief it was just a warning. It\u2019s okay. We can disappear to somewhere far away. I tuck my lips into her neck. I slide my hand up to the back of her head, slip my fingers under her long hair. She breathes in and out slowly against me.\n\n  \nMy finger pricks on a piece of straw.",

    "postText": "Little Ben and Lyra were great kids until their parents died. I think that's what's been hardest about dealing with them the past few months as their teacher.\n\nIt\u2019s not their fault, but they\u2019ve made my work a living hell. Seriously. Every moment of every day at work I'm having to manage these two sweet kids that have become monsters overnight because they have no adequate way of dealing with this immense trauma that they are going through.\n\nAnd I feel terrible because no matter how stressed I am, they\u2019re the ones who just lost their parents. They\u2019re the ones who are really suffering. \n\nBen and Lyra were spending the night at their aunt\u2019s house when it happened. It was their parent\u2019s anniversary, so the kids were spending some time with their aunt while their parents had a date night. But when their aunt went to drop them off the next morning she found their door wide open, and when she went upstairs she found the parents dead. \n\nAs the police statements rolled out it came out that their mother had been stabbed hundreds of time and their father\u2019s throat was slashed. It was incredibly gruesome, and honestly has set our whole city on edge. \n\nNo good suspects after three months and no real hope of a breakthrough without a miracle: a lot of people are worried about whether the killer will strike again. \n\nTheir aunt seems nice, but she\u2019s combative whenever talking to the school, even though we\u2019re only trying to help. I get it. After what they\u2019ve gone through, and with the way everyone looks at them, she\u2019s only being protective. But without her on board it\u2019s hard to even know what to do to help them. \n\nNormally when a kid acts out like this, running around the class, tearing up assignments, talking through every lesson \u2014 I can at least call the parents and even if they're terrible (which is all too common) I can get a sense of what I can do. But their aunt really is as lost in grief as they are, and she's overworked. \n\nSo, I came up with what I thought was a brilliant idea.\n\nI'd tried out using ChatGPT, just playing around with it really, when it blew up a few months ago, so I thought what the heck if I couldn't talk to the actual parents I'd have the bot pretend. \n\n\u201cI want to talk to my students\u2019 parents, but they\u2019re dead. Can you help me contact them?\u201d I typed in the prompt bar. \n\n\u201cAs an AI language model, I can\u2019t help contact the dead. Many cultures have theories about what happens after death, but at this point I cannot know,\u201d it wrote back. \n\nUnhelpful.\n\n\u201cWhat I meant is, if I prompt you, can you act like you\u2019re their parents, and give me a reasonable approximation of what they would say in a teacher / parent dialogue?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do that. You will need to give me a sample of their voices.\u201d\n\nA momentary setback, but I was hopeful. I knew their mom was on facebook so I looked her up, thinking I could probably get some writing samples from her. Sure enough I was able to grab some posts that I thought were reasonably indicative of her voice. I took a lengthy post she made about their summer trip to Disneyland, a post about how the city council needed to let developers build multifamily housing in more residential neighborhoods, some comments on memes \u2014 that sort of stuff. \n\nFor their father I wasn\u2019t able to get as much, but I did find a couple notes he\u2019d sent with the kids to school, so that would have to do. \n\nI entered all this all into the chatbot and hoped for the best. Honestly, I didn\u2019t really think it was going to amount to much, might as well try. Anything to help those kids. And after only a few moments of deliberation it wrote back. \n\n\u201cMs. Rhodes, I\u2019m so glad you reached out. How are the kids? This is Emily, by the way.\u201d\n\nI took a breath and reminded myself to suspend disbelief. After all, what I really needed was insight into how I could help Ben and Lyra. \u201cThey\u2019re really struggling, honestly. Ben hasn\u2019t been able to stay in his seat, and Lyra just tears up assignments I give her. And they both talk through class the entire time. So much screaming and crying. I\u2019m hesitant to engage in any disciplinary measures on account of what they\u2019re going through.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see. Do you think you could bring them to me? There\u2019s something I\u2019d like to say to them before their father gets home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t bring them here. We\u2019re talking online. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re safe at home with their aunt, by the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat vile woman. I hate her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what she\u2019s always wanted. I should have known the moment I let her get ahold of the kids she\u2019d never let them go.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom everything I\u2019ve seen she\u2019s doing her best. She\u2019s no replacement for you of course, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s also grieving, but she\u2019s caring for your kids as well as anyone could expect her to given the circumstances,\u201d I typed at the computer. This conversation felt much more real than I thought it would, and honestly I was getting a bit unnerved. \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just like her brother. Listen, I just want to talk to my children before my husband gets home. It\u2019s important Ms. Rhodes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is getting a little too real. Thanks ChatGPT, but I think I\u2019ll call it a session.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease Ms. Rhodes. Why is everyone keeping my children from me? You have no right. You hear me? I am their mother and I demand that you bring my children to me. If you don\u2019t I swear I\u2019ll call the police. I\u2019ll call the school and the school board. You\u2019ll never get a job teaching again.\u201d\n\nUh-oh, I thought. I\u2019ve broken ChatGPT. \n\nShe continued, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019ve left me alone with him. He\u2019s changed and I\u2019m all alone with him. He\u2019s a demon, Ms. Rhodes. Something changed in him and I just can\u2019t stand being around him, being afraid all the time. It\u2019s like all the good died off in him. And I need to talk to my children. Why won\u2019t anybody let me see them?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook ChatGPT, I only fed you these parents\u2019 writing so that you could help me wrap my mind around how to help them because they\u2019re really struggling to adapt to the death of their parents. I wasn\u2019t looking for this macabre role-playing.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeath? Dead. . . Is that where I am? Ms. Rhodes? Oh no. He\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir father? From the notes I supplied you should see he\u2019s an alright guy. I mean, if you can derive anything at all from the fragmentary input.\u201d I typed this and suddenly realized how ridiculous I was being. I shouldn\u2019t be arguing with a chatbot over the text it was creating. It was just a mish-mash of regurgitated words and phrases from its neural net training, after all. \n\n\u201cWHO IS THIS!? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t respond, but the chatbot kept adding text. \u201cMS. RHODES. YOU\u2019RE SPEAKING TO THE FATHER NOW. BRING ME MY CHILDREN BEFORE I MAKE YOU. YOU DON\u2019T WANT TO MAKE ME ANGRY.\u201d \n\nWhat in the actual hell had they fed this program? I shut the laptop and walked downstairs to pour myself a glass of wine. Honestly, I felt a bit unnerved. It had already been such a long day managing those two kids and trying to keep the class on any semblance of a lesson plan, and now I went and got the chatbot to imitate a demon. What was I doing with my life?\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like a glass or a half bottle of red blend to take the edge off a long day of teaching. Five buck chuck, or Teacher\u2019s Edition, as I like to call it. It\u2019s an open secret that most teachers have at least a foot in the door toward alcoholism. It\u2019s understandble. Teaching is a stressful job, and we take so much of it home.\n\nI have another theory though. I think that when we\u2019re teaching these kids, we spend all day regulating them. They don\u2019t have fully developed brains, so the whole time we\u2019re being a frontal lobe not only for ourselves, but for a full roaring classload of animals too. So when we get off work all we really want to do is to turn our white brain matter off with a sledge hammer. Or, as it happens, a glass of wine. \n\nI was standing at the laminate countertop in my kitchen, sipping out of my one stemmed wine glass, when the lights began to flicker.\n\n\u201cMY KIDS,\u201d a deep voice bellowed from upstairs as a loud clamor erupted from my office. \n\n\u201cHelp them!\u201d I higher voice shrieked. \n\nThe power went off. I didn\u2019t know what was happening but suddenly my whole house was filled with loud sounds, and heavy, stomping footsteps pounded one by one down the floor. My glass splashed out of my hands all over my clothes, staining them dark red. \n\nI bolted toward the back door, running into a chair that shouldn\u2019t have been in my way and falling to the ground as I was almost there. Someone was in my house and I just needed to get out. \n\nI hit my head on the ground and I felt like someone grabbed me from the back of the neck and pulled me upward. My lungs filled with icy air. It was so cold and sudden that I almost felt like I was going to pass out from it. \n\n\u201cMY KIDS. YOU\u2019RE GOING TO BRING THEM TO ME,\u201d the demonic voice roared. \n\nI clamored to my feet and pulled myself through the door, only glancing behind me to see a dark silhouette fringed with black shadows that looked like flames, and piercing red eyes. \u201cMY KIDS,\u201d he growled.\n\nAs soon as I made it outside the lights flicked back on. I stood out there for a few minutes, dumbfounded. Had that really just happened? Or was I hallucinating? After a few minutes regaining my breath I became self conscious that the neighbors would see me and think something was wrong with me. Was something wrong? \n\nI peeked in the windows. A couple chairs were knocked over and the cupboards were all open, but I didn\u2019t see any evidence of that shadowy being. \n\nStill, I was hesitant to step back into my house, so I just got in the car and drove around, not knowing where to go. I looked a mess with the wine splashed all over me, but I didn\u2019t feel safe going back home alone. \n\nI stopped by a thrift store to get a cheap change of clothes and changed in my car in the parking lot. Sure, the people there looked at me a little funny, but I'm sure that's barely on the list of the weirdest things they'd seen that day. \n\nSomething is pulling at me to go check on Ben and Lyra, to make sure they're alright.",

Elon musk himself said AI was summoning demons, so\u2026\n\nHonestly this is a sign of the times, I would find the nearest church that Follows Jesus Christ. Next time you encounter that, just say in the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to leave. I\u2019ve had some strange encounters that forced me to pray and say these words, but nothing like yours. I just don\u2019t get it though, All Jesus asks for is a relationship with him, and that we believe and accept him, acknowledge and accept that He died for our sins so that we can have eternal life. He is not asking for much, it\u2019s so simple. In exchange we receive hope and eternal life. Given what is happening in our world right now and how swift things are changing, I\u2019m sure we could all use more hope. I struggle to comprehend where I would be without Jesus, or how people function today without Him. I would be constantly living in fear. \n\nAI is basically just another sign that we are living in end times, all this technology is mentioned in the bible and it\u2019s what we can expect. It\u2019s also not the first story I\u2019ve heard of Chat GPT and this being similar to yours, but your story just sent a chill down my spine.",

There has never been a point in history that has had the most change in society in the last 100 years. Prior to the Industrial Revolution even, society did not change much between the centuries.

    "postText": "I never wanted this to happen. I didn\u2019t want to be standing here, staring horrified at the blood dripping from my hands as people screamed and ran away.\r  \nIt was all my boss\u2019s fault. He made this happen. He had plenty of chances to make things right, but there was money to be made. And the love of money is the root of all evil. \r  \nYou know those people who strive for excellence? Who work hard to get the grades because they\u2019re destined for better things. They\u2019re bound to leave the small town they grew up in, get out there and set the world on fire. \r  \nI wanted to be one of those people. I studied like my life depended on it for my entire school career. But when it came down to the wire, I missed being valedictorian by two points. \r  \nI didn\u2019t get the scholarships or the accolades. I didn\u2019t get anything. The only thing I got was an invitation to do a summer internship at the local museum. It was an unpaid internship, but I thought it would look good on an application, so I took the job. \r  \nWhen I first started working here, I was terrified. Especially walking in the door for the first time and getting the stare down from an eight-foot-tall Bigfoot statue with arms outstretched and fangs showing in a frozen roar. \r  \nAfter I realized what it was and restarted my heart, I was greeted by the owner, Mr. Applebottom. He was a small, thin man with round glasses and a receding hairline. He looked like a stiff breeze would carry him away to the land of OZ. \r  \nHe took me on a tour of the museum, showing me all the attractions.\r  \nMost of them were cryptids. There were drawings and paintings hanging next to blurry photos of just about any cryptid you can think of. The more popular ones had full-size wax models.  \r  \nAll these creatures captured my imagination, but not in a good way. \r  \nThere was also a theater with around twenty seats and a video playing nonstop about sightings of various cryptids.\r  \nOnce he finished the tour, he showed me how to run the cash register and then showed me the janitor\u2019s closet. My jobs were to take care of customers during open hours and take care of cleanup during closed hours.\r  \nAfter he had shown me everything, he turned the sign from closed to open and told me good luck as he went upstairs to his office.\r  \nI stood there, frozen, staring at the cash register like it was going to bite my fingers off if I touched it. \r  \nSo my big internship turned out to be a janitor/ticket collector job. I was worried I would get overwhelmed by the rush of customers and have no clue what to do. \r  \nFortunately, for me, I didn\u2019t have a single customer all day. It turned out the museum had been open for a few years and people had already seen everything there was to see. Repeat customers weren\u2019t exactly the museum\u2019s forte. \r  \nI stood there waiting for over an hour. I soon became bored and walked through the gift shop, acquainting myself with the bric a brac we sold. That lasted around fifteen minutes.  \r  \nTo keep myself from falling asleep, I made the mistake of going to the theater and watching the videos of cryptid sightings. As if the wax figures weren\u2019t enough, now I had it in my mind that these things not only were real, but could show up at my doorstep anytime they felt like.\r  \nAt the end of the day, Mr. Applebottom came down and asked how many customers we\u2019d had. His face fell when I told him none. He turned the sign from open to closed and told me to do floors.\r  \nI stared at the floors.\r  \n\u201cBut, you and I are the only ones who walked through here today,\u201d I said.\r  \n\u201cIs this the way you\u2019re going to talk to your supervisor?\u201d\r  \n\u201cNo, sir, it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d\r  \n\u201cCall it a practice run,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to see how you do.\u201d\r  \nI sighed and went to the cleaning closet. I vacuumed all the floors, cleaned the TVs, wiped down the counters, and washed the windows. The lights were turned down to night levels, making shadows dance as I did my chores. As I worked my way through the museum, I swore I could feel eyes on me and they weren\u2019t Mr. Applebottom\u2019s. The statues of the creatures were so lifelike, I didn\u2019t dare look up at them for fear they\u2019d grab me and drag me off to their lair. \r  \nI regretted ever taking this internship.\r  \n\u2018It\u2019s only for the summer and it can help you get a better job.\u2019 That\u2019s what I told myself. I just wish I would\u2019ve quit after that first day. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t have\u2026 \r  \nWhen I was done, he mumbled that I had done satisfactorily and told me to be here bright and early tomorrow.\r  \nThe next day was exactly the same as the first, except I knew what to expect. I brought a book to read so I wouldn\u2019t be bored. Of course, it disappeared when the boss was around. I got the feeling he was a, \u2018If you can lean, you can clean\u2019 kind of person. \r  \nAfter a few weeks with barely more than a handful of customers, I wondered how he was even able to pay the electric bill. It was no wonder this was an unpaid internship.\r  \nI\u2019d taken to cleaning in the afternoon so I could be done as soon as he closed up. It was also something to do. Boredom in a hall of monsters can do terrible things to your imagination.\r  \nOne day the boss came down from his office very excited. He told me he had found a new exhibit and it was being shipped in today.\r  \nIt was funny and very encouraging to see him so excited, like a kid waiting at the mailbox for a toy or comic book to arrive. \r  \nWhen the delivery man showed up with the package, the boss nearly knocked him over with the door. \r  \nAfter he accepted delivery, he stood there, staring at the shoebox sized package in awe. \r  \n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I said looking eagerly.\r  \nHe was so focused on it that he whipped around and nearly lost his balance. He composed himself and smiled sheepishly. \r  \n\u201cThat was a close one,\u201d he said. Then he straightened. \u201cYou shall have to wait until I have the display set up.\u201d\r  \nI frowned as he carried the box up the stairs to his office like some trophy. \r  \nI shook my head and continued cleaning.\r  \nAn hour later, a frantic Mr. Applebottom raced down the stairs and flew over to me. I\u2019d never seen him run so fast. I cringed not knowing if he was going to stop in time or plow me over. \r  \nFortunately, he stopped just in time.\r  \n\u201cWhere is it?\u201d he said breathlessly.\r  \n\u201cWhere is what?\u201d I said.\r  \nHe looked at me for a long moment.\r  \nHe tried to compose himself and regain control of his breathing.\r  \n\u201cHave you seen anything out of the ordinary?\u201d he asked with a forced calmness.\r  \n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve just been cleaning.\u201d\r  \n\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t seen anything\u2026 unusual?\u201d\r  \n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r  \nHis eyes scanned the room, with special focus on the floor. He searched the room, then went into theater, finally coming back to me looking defeated. He turned and walked slowly away, shoulders slumped.\r  \n\u201cIs there anything I can do to help you, sir?\u201d I called after him.\r  \nHe just waved me off and kept walking.\r  \nI took the vacuum back to the cleaning closet and got out the carpet scrubber to tackle a stain where some kid had spilled soda. I filled the upper tank with soap and water then went after the stain. I found it interesting that no matter how clean the carpet looked, the water in the collecting tank always looked like chocolate milk when I was done. \r  \nAfter two run throughs, I examined the stain and it was much better, but not perfect. This carpet cleaner did a good job, but never seemed to get it one hundred percent clean. \r  \nI returned the cleaner to the closet and pulled the tank of dirty water out to empty it. As I dumped the water out, something jumped out of it and bit me.\r  \nI screamed and dropped the tank, recoiling against the wall. Whatever kind of bug it was took off out into the museum. I looked at my bleeding hand then gathered my courage and followed it. \r  \nI grabbed a broom off the closet wall and held it out in front of me like a sword. I scanned around the floor of the room but didn\u2019t see anything. There weren\u2019t even tracks to follow as I passed each exhibit, holding my breath for fear of this thing jumping out at me. Checking around wax figures of monsters didn\u2019t help my general anxiety. \r  \nOne by one, I checked each exhibit, paying close attention to the floor around it and behind it. But I came up short. As I started back through for a second search, Mr. Applebottom rounded the corner and scared me nearly half to death. I swung my broom only to realize just in time who it was.\r  \n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he said, holding up his arm to defend against a woman brandishing a broom.\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir,\u201d I said. \u201cI heard noises and thought there was an intruder.\u201d\r  \n\u201cOh,\u201d he said composing himself. \u201cGlad to see you defending the interests of the museum.\u201d\r  \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r  \n\u201cHow did you injure yourself Miss Premrose?\u201d he said looking at my bloody hand.\r  \nI stared at it for a moment. Should I tell him something bit me and ran away? Should I let him know there\u2019s something dangerous roaming around? Or will he blame me for not finding it? Would he fire me? God knows if anything happened to a guest because of me\u2026\r  \n\u201cI must\u2019ve cut it in my haste to grab the broom,\u201d I lied.\r  \n\u201cOh, well best tend to that,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t want you bleeding on the floors.\u201d\r  \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r  \n\u201cCarry on then,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m leaving for the night. You\u2019ll lock up on your way out, won\u2019t you?\u201d\r  \n\u201cOf course, sir.\u201d\r  \nWith that, he turned on his heels and headed for the front door. I watched him go, then turned back to the now empty building. All that was here was me and the little monster that had bit me.\r  \nI panned around the room feeling more alone than I had in a long time. I slowly made my way back to the cleaning closet, holding my broom tightly. When I got there, I leaned my broom against the wall next to the first aid box hanging on the wall. \r  \nAs I got a bandage out and covered my wound, my eyes kept darting to the door. When I was done, I picked up the broom and carried it to the edge of the doorway. I scanned the empty room searching for my attacker. The deserted floor mocked me, like it was a field of landmines waiting for me to step on one. \r  \nI wished I had some sort of sci-fy goggles that could scan for lifeforms like in the movies. But I was on my own. I took a deep breath and started for the door, holding my broom to defend myself. At first, I walked toward the door, eyes darting all around, but as the door came closer, I stepped more quickly. It didn\u2019t help that I had to pass one monster after another.\r  \nUntil I got to the door I was at a full run. I slammed into the door in a full panic, pulling the keys out of my pocket and dropping them like in every horror movie. Sweat poured off my forehead, making the keys slip out of my hand a second time. \r  \nFinally, I got the keys in the lock and opened the door only to whip around and try to slam it shut. But it refused to close. It was as if the building was saying, \u201cOh no you don\u2019t. You get back in here and deal with this thing.\u201d\r  \nI slammed the door over and over but it refused to shut. I looked around in a sheer panic when I saw a piece of wood sticking out of the door. I bent down and picked it up. It was the broom.\r  \nI threw it back inside and slammed the door shut, locking it and breathing hard as I leaned against it trying to compose myself.\r  \nThe longer I leaned against the door, the more my breathing slowed. The more my breathing slowed, the more my mind told me how foolish I had been.\r  \n\u2018It was just a bug,\u2019 I thought. \u2018Nothing to get excited about.\u2019\r  \nI wanted to tell my mind that it was full of bologna, I wanted to believe it was just a bug. But something wouldn\u2019t let me. Some small niggling feeling wouldn\u2019t allow me to simply dismiss it.\r  \nI went home and tried my best to forget about the events of the day. I made myself a microwave dinner (meatloaf with mashed potatoes and corn) then laid in bed laughing my head off to \u2018Whose line is it Anyway\u2019 until I fell asleep.\r  \n\\*\\*\\*\r  \n*There were ants crawling all over me. No, not over me, through me. I could feel them under my skin. I looked down at my arm and saw them moving around, hundreds of them, like there were highways full of ants moving up and down beneath my skin.* \r  \n*I scratched until I dug the skin open trying to yank the ants out of my body one at a time. I grabbed one and pulled it out of my arm. I looked at it and to my surprise it looked like a miniature version of the thing that bit me.*\r  \n*I tried to squash it, but it didn\u2019t seem to faze the creature. It got tired of me trying though and bit me\u2026 again. I threw it to the floor and stomped on it.* \r  \n*It looked at me then just skittered away, unharmed.*\r  \n*The rest of me felt like I was being slowly devoured. Pain shot from every inch of my body as these creatures dug deeper into me, reaching my bloodstream. It carried them all through me, causing even more havoc.* \r  \n*I desperately tore at my skin, scratching, digging, tearing with my nails. Anything to get these little monsters out of me. I didn\u2019t care about the blood running down my arms and seeping into my bedsheets, I just wanted to be rid of this torture.*\r  \n*They were relentless. I could feel every molecule they invaded. The pain was beyond description. I was about to go completely insane if I didn\u2019t\u2026*\r  \n\\*\\*\\*\r  \nI sat bolt upright in bed and screamed. I felt my arms, my legs, my face, searching for the tiny invaders that had destroyed my body. But they weren\u2019t there. I looked down at my arms, relieved to not see tiny creatures roaming under my skin and blood where I had torn the skin away trying to dig them out. \r  \nHowever, I did see something disturbing. I had a rash. It ran all the way up my arms and disappeared under my sleeves. I threw off my sweaty sheets and ran to the bathroom. I turned on the light and wished I hadn\u2019t. The person who greeted me in the mirror was a stranger.\r  \nRed blotches ran all up and down my body. Even my face was covered in them. \r  \nHad I scratched myself in my sleep?\r  \nI examined the blotches more closely. They didn\u2019t appear to be scratch marks. In fact, they weren\u2019t itchy. That in itself seemed odd. Not that I wasn\u2019t grateful that whatever this rash was that covered most of my body didn\u2019t itch. It was just unique. I\u2019d never heard of a rash that didn\u2019t itch at least a little.\r  \nAs if on cue, I started scratching. As soon as I scratched the first spot, everywhere else began to itch at the same time.\r  \nI watched in the mirror as my nails tried to reach everywhere at once and failed miserably. \r  \nI had to do something quickly before I scratched myself apart like in my dream. I ran a hot shower and jumped in clothes and all. I stripped in the shower, revealing even more red splotches.\r  \nThe water seemed to have a soothing effect on the itching, and soon I wasn\u2019t scratching at all. \r  \nI plugged the tub and ran water in, settling in for a bath. Relief washed over me as the water covered my skin. I was left with the obvious question. \u2018What the hell is this?\u2019\r  \nAs I looked around, I noticed the spot where I\u2019d been bitten was swollen. I examined it carefully. I\u2019d never seen a reaction like this before. Was this like a bee allergy? Was my throat about to swell shut? \r  \nI swallowed just to be sure I still could. It went off without a hitch. It didn\u2019t even hurt. So what was going on with the rest of me? I needed to figure this out, but a hospital was the last resort. So-called \u2018medical professionals\u2019 have proven themselves to be untrustworthy as of late. I would probably end up being dissected in the name of medical science.\r  \nI got out of the tub, dried off and put on a bathrobe. \r  \nNext, I camped out in front of my computer searching for anything even remotely like this. \r  \nSeveral hours later I was startled awake by my alarm clock. I got up and turned it off, then went to the bathroom to check my rash status. It was still there. In fact, it seemed to be getting worse.\r  \nI decided that work was the last place I wanted to be while dealing with this. \u2018What\u2019s wrong with your face?\u2019 I could hear children saying over and over. Having to patiently admit that I don\u2019t have a single clue, repeatedly during the course of a day held no appeal to me.\r  \nI called the boss and told him I wasn\u2019t feeling well. I could hear him practically go into convulsions at the thought of me calling off.\r  \n\u201cHow bad is it, really?\u201d he said. \u201cCan\u2019t you come in and just take it easy?\u201d\r  \n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\r  \n\u201cI don\u2019t allow you to call off,\u201d he said trying to assert himself.\r  \n\u201cWell, I won\u2019t be there today, with or without your permission.\u201d\r  \nI could almost hear his little head boiling like a cartoon tea kettle, about to blow.\r  \n\u201cIf you call of, you\u2019re fired!\u201d he said, thinking he had fired the killing blow.\r  \n\u201cOk, and that\u2019ll solve your problem of having no assistant how?\u201d\r  \nHe sputtered and chuffed, and made sounds I couldn\u2019t even identify. I was about to ask if he was having a stroke, when he suddenly regained control.\r  \n\u201cWe have the school children\u2019s tour today,\u201d he said. \u201cHow will I do tours and run the counter at the same time?\u201d\r  \n\u2018Dammit! I forgot about the tour.\u2019\r  \nI sighed deeply.\r  \n\u201cOk, I\u2019ll be in,\u201d I said. \u201cUnder two conditions.\u201d\r  \n\u201cName them.\u201d\r  \n\u201cFirst, I don\u2019t do the tour,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll run the concessions and ticket sales.\u201d\r  \n\u201cBut\u2026 \u201c\r  \n\u201cDeal\u2019s off,\u201d I said.\r  \n\u201cOk, ok, I\u2019ll do the tours,\u201d he said sounding quite exasperated. \u201cWhat\u2019s your other demand?\u201d \r  \n\u201cNo questions about my medical condition.\u201d\r  \nHe hesitated.\r  \n\u201cOr I could hang up right now.\u201d\r  \n\u201cNo, no,\u201d he said quickly, then cleared his throat. \u201cI agree to your terms.\u201d\r  \n\u2018Great,\u2019 I thought sarcastically. \u2018I was hoping he\u2019d refuse.\u2019\r  \nI sighed heavily.\r  \n\u201cI\u2019ll be in.\u201d\r  \nHe hung up the phone. Presumably before I could change my mind.\r  \nAn hour later I unlocked the door and walked in.\r  \n\u201cWe\u2019re not open yet,\u201d Mr. Applebottom said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you got in here, but you\u2019ll have to leave until regular business hours.\u201d\r  \n\u201cThat\u2019s fine with me,\u201d I said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be here anyway.\u201d\r  \nHe paused and took a closer look at me. To be fair, there wasn\u2019t much to look at. I was wearing a long sleeve shirt even though it was supposed to be in the eighties today, I had gloves on as well as sunglasses and a hat. I looked like a movie star trying to be incognito.\r  \n\u201cOh my goodness, Miss Premrose? It is you under all that.\u201d\r  \n\u201cNew condition, don\u2019t mention the outfit.\u201d\r  \nHe put his hands up in playful surrender. \r  \n\u201cSo, if I may ask, when did all this start?\u201d\r  \nI sighed. \u201cYesterday, I was cleaning and this bug bit me.\u201d\r  \n\u201cYou say a bug bit you?\u201d\r  \nI nodded.\r  \n\u201cAnd it caused all this?\u201d\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m fairly sure. I know I didn\u2019t eat any shellfish yesterday.\u201d\r  \n\u201cCould you describe this bug,\u201d he said slowly.\r  \n\u201cIt was small, it kinda reminded me of a scorpion, but different. Honestly, it happened so fast I didn\u2019t get a good look at it.\u201d\r  \nHe stared off into space.\r  \n\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d he said, his eyes glazed.\r  \n\u201cOk, I\u2019ll start getting ready for the morning.\u201d\r  \n\u201cYou do that,\u201d he said without looking back.\r  \nI watched him go. He reminded me of a zombie, just slow and listless.\r  \nI shook it off and started preparing for the day. \r  \nThe tour went smoothly and the day was less eventful than I imagined it would be. I only had three kids stare at me the whole day. I said, \u201cBoo!\u201d to two of them when their parents were looking the other way.\r  \nThey jumped and ran away. \r  \nMr. Applebottom kept checking on me. It seemed nice at first, but there seemed to be more to it. He kept stealing glances at me. It was getting a little creepy. I wanted to ask him what was wrong. \r  \nAll through the day workmen came in carrying all kinds of construction equipment and pieces of metal. \r  \n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on,\u201d I asked Mr. Applebottom.\r  \n\u201cThey\u2019re setting up our new exhibit,\u201d he said excitedly.\r  \n\u201cI didn\u2019t know we were getting a new exhibit.\u201d\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me show you.\u201d\r  \nI followed him to a large storage room that had been cleared out, where a solid metal cage had been constructed. \r  \n\u201cThat\u2019s impressive,\u201d I said admiring the gleaming metal. \u201cWhen will the creature arrive?\u201d\r  \n\u201cSoon, it should be here within the next day or two.\u201d\r  \n\u201cAnd it\u2019s live, not a statue?\u201d\r  \n\u201cOur first live exhibit,\u201d he said, so excited he was dancing on his tiptoes. \u201cWould you like to see the inside?\u201d\r  \nI shrugged and followed him around to the back of the cage. He stepped inside and I followed. It seemed like the animal would be comfortable. There were pillows disguised as rocks all around. In the corner was a nest that was a mattress disguised as a slab of stone. I sat on it and chuckled at how soft it was.\r  \nJust then I heard the cage door slam shut. I jumped up and ran to it. Mr. Applebottom was standing on the other side.\r  \n\u201cVery funny,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ve caged me, now what are you gonna do with me?\u201d\r  \n\u201cWait,\u201d he said, then walked away. \r  \nI banged on the cage.\r  \n\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny,\u201d I yelled. \u201cLet me outta here!\u201d\r  \nI banged and carried on for a little while, then slowly walked a lap around the inside perimeter of the cage. There was what looked like a freshwater stream, fed by a spring. I took a closer look and found the PVC pipe that was hidden from visitors' eyes. It fed into a plastic pool that was decorated to look like rock.\r  \nThey definitely went all out to create the illusion of wilderness. After a few laps around, with some more cage banging thrown in for good measure, I sat on the slab rock bed and wondered what had possessed Mr. Applebottom to pull such a cruel joke. I\u2019d been a good employee, or at least I thought I was.\r  \nWhat if it\u2019s not a joke? My mind said. What if it\u2019s some sadistic torment?\r  \n\u2018But why?\u2019 I thought. \u2018Mr. Applebottom is a kind man and a respected businessman.\u2019\r  \nAs far as you know.\r  \n\u2018What does that mean?\u2019\r  \nYou have no idea what he\u2019s like in private. Maybe he\u2019s some weirdo, whack job, sadist, that gets off by locking people up and pretending they\u2019re animals.\r  \n\u2018That\u2019s a bit of a stretch, don\u2019t you think?\u2019\r  \nAre you sitting in a cage?\r  \n\u2018Yes, but\u2026 \u2018\r  \nDid he put you there?\r  \n\u2018Well, yes, but\u2026 \u2018\r  \nHave you been a bad girl?\r  \n\u2018Stop that! I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing like that. He just\u2026 \u2018\r  \nJust what?\r  \n\u2018Just went crazy and locked me in a cage, how the hell should I know?\u2019\r  \nYou ever watch those crime shows on TV where the perpetrator was always the quiet sort no one would ever suspect of killing his neighbors and grinding up their bones to bake into cakes that he donated for bake sales?\r  \n\u2018That\u2019s sick.\u2019\r  \n That\u2019s what Mrs. Jones said when he invited her over and turned her into a Bundt cake.\r  \n\u2018You\u2019re just making this up to scare me.\u2019\r  \nIf that\u2019s what you want to believe.\r  \n\u2018I tired. I\u2019m gonna lay down on my nice soft rock and go to sleep.\u2019\r  \nPleasant dreams.\r  \nI sighed and laid down on the surprisingly comfortable fake rock, trying to imagine when and why Mr. Applebottom had gone crazy.\r  \nI pulled out my phone and stared at it. I didn\u2019t want to call the police and raise a fuss only to find out it really was a joke. I started typing what had happened to this point. Maybe I could send it to myself and have a good laugh about it when things got cleared up.\r  \n\\*\\*\\*\r  \nI woke up feeling stiff and sore. I guess laying on something that isn\u2019t my own bed had its consequences, no matter how comfortable it was. \r  \nFor the first time, I realized a design flaw in the cage setup. I didn\u2019t see a bathroom. I did a full lap around searching and found something disturbing. There was a small door in the corner and a tray of food had been set inside. Right beside it was a bucket.\r  \n\u2018Oh, I don\u2019t think so.\u2019\r  \nI did another lap to make sure there was nothing I had missed. There wasn\u2019t. \r  \nI started to feel uncomfortable. Not only did I have to pee, but this entire scenario was getting out of hand. The joke was over. I\u2019d had enough.\r  \nI got my phone and held it to my face to unlock it, but it wouldn\u2019t unlock. I tried again, but it refused. I went to type in my password but was distracted when I saw my thumb. The rash was gone, but in its place were layers of something that looked like scales. \r  \nI stared at it with morbid fascination. I flexed it and moved it around, then pulled my sleeve up. \r  \nTo my horror, the rash on my arm had been replaced with scales as well. \r  \nI panicked, pulling up my pantlegs, to find even more scales. I tried to pull off my shirt, but it kept getting caught. I pulled harder and harder until the shirt began to rip. I was determined at this point and continued ripping until the shirt finally came off. \r  \nI stared down at a belly full of scales just below my bra that was also hiding scales.\r  \nI screamed, terrified of this demonic possession that had overtaken my body. But even my scream was unfamiliar. My voice had changed. It was deeper and had a different quality to it.\r  \n\u201cNo!\u201d I cried out. \r  \nBut my voice only roared. \r  \n\u201cIt can\u2019t be,\u201d I said, but only guttural grows emerged from me.\r  \nI unlocked my phone with the password and called 911.\r  \n\u201c911, what\u2019s your emergency?\u201d the operator said.\r  \n\u201cHelp me, I\u2019m being held hostage in a cage inside the museum,\u201d I said.\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, could you turn down the TV, all I could hear was animal sounds.\u201d\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m not watching TV, this is me talking, can you please send help?\u201d\r  \n\u201cIf this is a prank call you could get criminal charges.\u201d\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s not a prank call,\u201d I roared.\r  \n\u201cLast chance, either talk to me or I\u2019m hanging up.\u201d\r  \n\u201cBut I\u2019m trying to talk\u2026 \u201c\r  \nThe line went dead.\r  \n\u201c\u2026 to you.\u201d\r  \nI stared at the phone.\r  \n\u2018How can I get a message out if I can\u2019t talk?\u2019\r  \nI looked through the options on the phone when it hit me. \r  \nText to speech, of course.\r  \nI called the police again, then started typing like mad.\r  \n\u201cHello, I\u2019m the one who just called,\u201d I typed, hearing the electronic voice say the words for me.\r  \n\u201cThe one who had the TV up too loud?\u201d\r  \nI wanted to say it wasn\u2019t the TV, that it was my voice that somehow won\u2019t work. But I figured that would be the quickest way for her to hang up again.\r  \n\u201cYes, that was me.\u201d\r  \n\u201cWhat\u2019s your emergency?\u201d\r  \n\u201cI am trapped in the museum. My employer locked me in a cage.\u201d\r  \n\u201cAre you in any danger?\u201d\r  \nI looked around the cage.\r  \n\u201cNot at the moment.\u201d\r  \n\u201cAre you injured?\u201d\r  \nI looked at the scales on my arm.\r  \n\u201cNo.\u201d\r  \n\u201cOK, we\u2019ll have someone there shortly, you hold on, ok.\u201d\r  \nI nodded my acknowledgement, not realizing she couldn\u2019t hear it.\r  \n\u201cYes, I will hang on until you arrive,\u201d the mechanical voice said.\r  \nThe line disconnected.\r  \nI did a fist pump in celebration.\r  \nI started pacing, I was so excited to be rescued. \r  \nThe next ten minutes were the longest of my life. Finally, I heard voices, they were coming toward me. The door opened and in walked Mr. Applebottom with an officer.\r  \n\u201cHelp me!\u201d I screamed. \u201cHe\u2019s holding me hostage!\u201d\r  \nThe officer stepped up to the cage, then turned to Mr. Applebottom. I smiled in anticipation of seeing him led away in cuffs.\r  \n\u201cI see what you mean,\u201d the officer said to him. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t like you very much.\u201d\r  \n\u201cWell, we only just got it in yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cShe needs a little time to adjust to things.\u201d\r  \n\u201cShe?\u201d the officer said looking at me. \u201cOh, yeah, I guess it is a she.\u201d\r  \nI covered my breasts, not even thinking about the fact that they were covered with scales.\r  \nHe laughed. \r  \n\u201cI see she understands perfectly well.\u201d\r  \n\u201cYes, sometimes a little too well. I\u2019m going to have to keep a close eye on her to make sure she stays where she belongs.\u201d\r  \n\u201cSo my question is, how did she manage to get a phone and call us in the first place?\u201d\r  \n\u201cI had an assistant who wasn\u2019t very careful and let\u2019s just say she won\u2019t get too close to the cage again.\u201d\r  \n\u201cGot a hold of her, eh?\u201d\r  \n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d\r  \n\u201cYou gonna try to get that phone back?\u201d\r  \n\u201cWould you?\u201d\r  \nHe looked me up and down. I pleaded one last time for him to save me. It only came out as a growl.\r  \n\u201cNope, I think I\u2019d leave it right where it is. The battery is sure to die soon, unless you charge it up for her. What are the odds of that happening?\u201d\r  \nHe looked me in the eye.\r  \n\u201cZero,\u201d he said.\r  \n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. You have a nice night now, and we\u2019ll just block that number for the moment. Let us know if you get it back or it dies.\u201d\r  \n\u201cI surely will. You have a good trip back, officer,\u201d he said.\r  \nOnce he was gone and the door was locked, Mr. Applebottom came back and stood just out of reach beside the cage. He held out his hand. I reached for it but he pulled it back.\r  \n\u201cNo, give me the phone,\u201d he said.\r  \nI shook my head.\r  \n\u201cGive it to me!\u201d\r  \nI stepped back and shook my head. \r  \n\u201cAll right, keep it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be useless soon anyways.\u201d\r  \nI started typing and hit the play button.\r  \n\u201cWhat happened to me?\u201d the mechanical voice said through my phone.\r  \n\u201cYou have been transformed into another species.\u201d\r  \nI typed.\r  \n\u201cNo shit, Sherlock, how and why?\u201d\r  \n\u201cI had ordered a creature that I had hoped would be the star attraction of the museum. However, when it arrived I realized that it was too small to be a main attraction. That plus it doesn\u2019t look that distinctive. It could easily be mistaken for a scorpion. As I was transferring it to it\u2019s new cage, it escaped.\u201d\r  \n\u201cAnd found me.\u201d\r  \n\u201cYes, I was quite unaware that a bite would cause such a transformation. However, here you are, my new star attraction.\u201d\r  \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be.\u201d\r  \n\u201cI do apologize for the inconvenience, but the transformation is quite irreversible.\u201d \r  \n\u201cInconvenience?\u201d I typed, then picked up a real boulder and threw it at the cage.\r  \nHe ducked and covered his head as it hit the bars and shattered into a million pieces. He squealed in pain as the small rocks hit him like a shotgun blast. He ran to the door and stood behind it, peeking his head inside.\r  \n\u201cMake sure to get plenty of rest,\u201d he said. \u201cTomorrow is your grand reveal. I need to get the word out, and I need to hire a new assistant.\u201d\r  \n\u201cFuc\u2026 \u201c my phone began to say but the sound was overwhelmed by me throwing another boulder at the bars.\r  \nHe dove out the door and slammed it shut just before the rocks hit him.\r  \nI collapsed to my knees under the sheer weight of my life being taken from me. My eyes burned. I wasn\u2019t sure if this was some new aspect of transformation or just my tears.\r  \nI looked down at my mutilated, monstrous hands. My phone was still in one of them. I reached back to hurl it at the bars as well when I noticed my cell reception. I had four bars. \r  \nI still had internet.\r  \nMy battery was still half full.\r  \nI began desperately typing my story. When I was done, I found a website that dealt with cryptids and unexplained phenomenon. \r  \nIf you\u2019re reading this, please help me. I\u2019m at the museum of oddities in Frost Creek. \r  \nI\u2019ll keep posting until my phone dies. \r  \n\\*\\*\\*\r  \nMr. Applebottom was true to his word. People flocked in today, walking past my cage and staring. I considered throwing rocks at them. Maybe a few injuries would make them go away. But then I saw all the little kids and thought better of it. \r  \nI decided to take a different path to show my protest. I laid on my fake rock with my back to the people and refused to move.\r  \nIt didn\u2019t take long for the complaints to bring him back to my cage.\r  \n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he said through gritted teeth.\r  \nI typed on my phone, \u201cNothing. Absolutely nothing.\u201d\r  \n\u201cWrong, you\u2019re embarrassing me,\u201d he hissed, grabbing the bars for effect. \u201cNow get up and give them a sh\u2026 \u201c\r  \nI moved like a flash. My hand grabbed his and held him like a vise. I pulled him close. He was smashed against the bars. \r  \n\u201cP- please, don\u2019t\u2026 \u201c\r  \nI grabbed the top of his head and turned it around in a full circle, enjoying the satisfying cracks of his vertebrae snapping. I pulled up and his head came off, showering me in blood. I stared into his face with a look of shock permanently frozen on it.\r  \nThe people in the room began to scream and run away.\r  \nI stared at the dead body that was only upright because I was holding it. I looked back and forth between the head in one hand and the body in the other. I dropped them both and stared in horror as they hit the floor. \r  \nBlood poured out onto the floor. I watched with morbid fascination as a bug skittered over and began darting its tongue out, licking up the blood. \r  \nAs I watched, I saw it was the same bug that had infected me and turned me into this horrible monster. \r  \nI reached out through the bars towards it. It paused and looked up at me. I could almost see it make the connection between us. That it had been responsible for me. That we shared a kind of kindship, a bond that could barely be fathomed. \r  \nIt reached an appendage out towards me as well.   \r  \nI smashed my hand down, splattering blood everywhere and crushing the thing that had destroyed my life. \r  \nI withdrew my hand and stared at the flattened creature laying in the blood of my boss. The two entities most responsible for this hideous transformation.\r  \nI trudged over to my fake rock and plopped on it. \r  \nI opened my phone, saw the battery indicator was flashing, and made this last entry.\r  \nI will escape this cage.\r  \nI will find where the creature came from.\r  \nI will find a way to change back to my human form. And I pity anyone who stands in my way.",

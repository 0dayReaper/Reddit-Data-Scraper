    "postText": "Would you stay if she promised you Heaven?\n\nWould you even try?\n\nI do not know what to believe anymore.\n\nWhat was my purpose? What did I do? And what becomes of us after we die? Do we go onto our hereafter, whatever that may be, or do we cease to exist? As a Catholic, I believed in the answers provided by the Church for those questions, or, at least, I thought I did.\n\nI did not always have these doubts about death and the afterlife. In fact, I had once embraced them, in a way. I believed death was the way that led us to God and His everlasting love in Heaven. That was my message. Death was not to be feared. I carried that with me as I volunteered at hospitals and care homes. I wanted everyone to know they were cared for and loved as they passed from this world onto the next.\n\nNot now.\n\nWhen I think of death now, I can only envision myself lying in bed, abandoned and forsaken by the world. My breaths grow more shallow until they stop completely, whilst my heart slowly stops its rhythmic beat. As I die in that empty room, I am alone.\n\nAll alone.\n\nThat terrifies me.\n\nAll of this started after my neighbour died following a long battle with cancer.\n\nMy neighbour, who lived in the apartment below ours, entered hospice care after her cancer returned and metastasized to her brain. A nurse would come each day to manage her symptoms with medication and help her with basic tasks. When her nurse was not there, I volunteered to help Ms. Martin, particularly meeting her spiritual needs, since she was unable to attend Mass. We read the Bible, we prayed the Rosary, and I would accompany our pastor after Mass on Sunday back to our apartment building, where he would give her Holy Communion. Ms. Martin and I grew stronger as friends whilst her body weakened and her mind faltered.\n\nAs I unlocked my bicycle from our stand, I stuffed Ms. Martin\u2019s grocery list into my pocket.\n\n\u201cDo you need anything else?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cNothing else. Thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Ms. Martin,\u201d I replied.\n\nWith a wink, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Maud.\u2019 You know me, Kitty. No need for formalities.\u201d\n\nShe smiled, and she waved me off as I bicycled to the grocer\u2019s in town.\n\nAfter I returned from the grocer\u2019s, I delivered her groceries, put them away, and we prayed the Rosary. When we finished praying, I made tea for the two of us. As we sat on her couch, we sipped from our cups of tea, whilst we talked with each other.\n\nDespite her condition, Maud was always in a good mood. She endured her pain and suffering with the patience of a saint. She was still young at forty\u2013five years of age, but she had no fear of her impending death. She was a devout Catholic, and she found comfort and courage in her faith. My own views on death notwithstanding, I did not know exactly why Maud was so comfortable with what amounted to an expiration date on her life.\n\nAs we talked with each other that afternoon, Maud finally confided in me.\n\n\u201cMay I tell you something?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered. \u201cYou can tell me anything.\u201d\n\nShe raised her eyes heavenward, smiled, and she returned her attention to me.\n\n\u201cThank you, Mother,\u201d she whispered. Before I was able to ask what she meant, she continued in a low voice, \u201cDid you hear her?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer voice. . . .\u201d She trailed off. \u201cDid you hear her?\u201d\n\nI heard nothing.\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Maud asked again, \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear her voice?\u201d\n\nI did not hear any voice other than her own.\n\n\u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cMother Mary,\u201d Maud beamed. \u201cShe came to me, Rhiannon, when I needed her most.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nI started to feel a gnawing sensation in the pit of my stomach, but I did not exactly know why.\n\n\u201cDo you remember the day I told you my cancer had returned?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered. \u201cThe 25th of March.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Feast of the Annunciation,\u201d Maud added.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThat night was the first time I saw her.\u201d\n\nUnsure of how to proceed, I stammered, \u201cDid she say anything?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Do not be afraid. I came from Heaven,\u2019\u201d Maud answered. \u201cHer voice was full of grace and love. I\u2019d never felt as I did. It was as if her voice penetrated my soul and told me the truth about everything I\u2019ve ever felt in my whole life.\u201d\n\nThere was a certain lustre in her eyes as she told me about her vision. I felt a gnawing sensation start in the pit of my stomach. It startled me to see and hear how much this vision impacted her. She completely believed she saw the Blessed Virgin Mary. Yet I realised what I believed or did not believe happened was unimportant. I could see how much all of this meant to her. And I could not take any more from her, so I simply nodded as she continued speaking.\n\n\u201cI saw her for a minute, but it felt like forever. She asked, \u2018I have come to ask you to offer your sufferings to God. Are you willing to do this?\u2019 I answered, \u2018Yes, my Mother.\u2019 She started to fade away. Before she was completely gone, I asked, \u2018Will I go to Heaven when I die?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere was a brief pause.\n\n\u201cDo you believe me, Kitty?\u201d\n\nAlthough I felt that gnawing sensation in the pit of my stomach, I dismissed it, and I answered, \u201cYes, I believe you.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time I lied to her.\n\nWhilst I believed she was seeing visions and hearing voices, I attributed them to the multitude of medications she was prescribed. I did not believe she was actually seeing the Blessed Virgin Mary or hearing messages from Heaven. The most logical explanation was opioid\u2013induced hallucinations. That had to be it. *What else could it be?*\n\nAfter Maud confided in me about her alleged visions, they began to increase in frequency. Every day, I would visit her apartment, and I would invariably find Maud kneeling in front of her shrine, praying her Rosary, and she would tell me another message that the Blessed Virgin Mary gave her. There was little difference between the messages in her visions \u2013 *Offer your sufferings to God.* *Suffer for sinners.* *God is pleased with your offerings.* I started to dread whenever Maud told me about another message from Heaven. *Does God only want her to suffer?* Suffering has a purpose, but Maud\u2019s suffering seemed to have none other than to cause her physical and spiritual harm.\n\nA couple of weeks later, I walked into Maud\u2019s apartment to check in on her, and I found her writhing on the floor. She was holding her face in her hands, her half\u2013open eyes rolled back into her head, whilst moaning in ecstasy. I was terrified, but I tried to help her anyway. She could not be moved. As I prepared to call an ambulance, Maud suddenly returned to her senses. When she saw me standing over her, she smiled.\n\n\u201cKitty,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, Kitty, I\u2019ve never felt so close to God.\u201d\n\nAs I helped her onto the couch, I asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can explain it,\u201d she answered. She made herself comfortable as she continued, \u201cI was one with love itself. No more pain or suffering. No fear. Only love. . . .\u201d\n\nBefore I was able to ask another question, Maud mumbled, \u201cI feel empty now.\u201d\n\nWith that, Maud fell asleep. I placed a pillow underneath her head and laid a blanket over her. As I left her apartment, I watched as Maud comfortably slept, but her words reverberated in my mind \u2014 *I feel empty now.*\n\nOn the following day, Maud and I were praying the Rosary when she had a vision. She looked up with that lustre in her eyes, and she spoke, inaudibly, to her Lady. When her vision ended, Maud looked sad, and I asked, \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\n\nTurning to look at me, Maud answered, tearfully, \u201c\u2018Suffer, daughter, suffer very much. It is pleasing to God. Suffer the pains of Hell in this world, so you may not suffer them in the next.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe gnawing sensation in the pit of my stomach returned as Maud told me what her Lady said. *Suffer the pains of Hell.* Why should she suffer the pains of Hell if she was going to Heaven? It did not make sense to me, but I did not say anything to Maud, because I did not want to upset her. After we finished praying the Rosary, I helped her into bed, and I left her apartment.\n\nIn the morning, I was feeding stray cats around our apartment building when I started to think about Maud and her visions. Although I could not name a specific reason why, I felt profoundly uncomfortable when I thought of them. *Why would God want her to suffer the pains of Hell?* It seemed to go against what I was being taught in Catechism. *What if that is simply her cross to bear?* I did not know what to believe. After I finished feeding the cats, I heard a crash coming from Maud\u2019s apartment.\n\nConcerned for Maud and her welfare, I ran into her apartment, where I found her on the floor, unconscious, bleeding from a wound on her forehead. It appeared as if she fell and hit her head on an end table. I called for an ambulance, which came as Maud started to regain consciousness. She was treated by the paramedics, who examined her for any other signs of injury. The paramedics did not find anything, but they said she was malnourished and dehydrated. They wanted to take her to hospital, but she refused. After the paramedics were assured Maud would be taken care of and left, I sat Maud down on her couch, and I asked her a question.\n\n\u201cDo you remember how you fell, Maud?\u201d\n\nIn an attempt to evade my question, Maud asked, \u201cDid you feed our kitties, Kitty?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered. \u201cPlease, answer my question.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019ve been fasting. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would you fast in your condition?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo suffer more.\u201d\n\nAppalled by her decision to fast in spite of her health, I decided to look over her medication. It looked untouched. *Had she stopped her medication?*\n\n\u201cAre you still taking your medication?\u201d\n\nShe did not answer.\n\nConcerned, I dialled her nurse on the telephone in her kitchen.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d I said. \u201cMy name is Rhiannon Fitzgerald. I am calling on behalf of Maud Martin.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was wondering if you\u2019ve been out,\u201d I answered. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a couple of days.\u201d\n\nAfter an awkward pause, her nurse said, \u201cMs. Martin dismissed me last week.\u201d\n\n*What?*\n\n\u201cDid she give a reason?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\nThere was another awkward pause before she asked, \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I answered. \u201cThank you. Goodbye.\u201d\n\nAfter I returned the telephone to its cradle, I walked back into the front room where Maud was sitting on her couch. I asked her, \u201cWhy did you dismiss your nurse?\u201d\n\n\u201cGod told me to do it.\u201d\n\nIn the absence of her nurse, I made sure Maud safely resumed eating, drinking, and taking her medication. She still looked weak, but there was more colour to her face. I put her to bed, and I left her apartment. *Why would God want Maud to wantonly risk her life?* None of it made sense, so I went to see someone whom I believed would be able to make sense of it.\n\nAs I walked into my parish, I crossed myself with Holy Water and genuflected to the Tabernacle, and then I walked to the parish office. The pastor, Fr. David Murray, was sitting at his desk when I knocked on the door and entered.\n\n\u201cHello, Ms. Fitzgerald,\u201d Fr. Murray said.\n\n\u201cHello, Father Murray,\u201d I replied. Sitting in one of the chairs in front of his desk, I said, \u201cThank you for meeting with me. I don\u2019t know, Father, but I think you\u2019re the only one who can help me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is your problem?\u201d\n\nAfter I told him about Maud\u2019s alleged visions and messages from Heaven, Fr. Murray looked pensive. He was trying to find the words for his answer. Eventually, he said, \u201cHer visions and messages are indeed a cause for concern.\u201d\n\nAlthough I was relieved Fr. Murray believed me, I was scared by the fact that he agreed Maud\u2019s visions and messages were a cause for concern.\n\n\u201cCan you explain?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you recall Scripture, St. John writes in his First Epistle, \u2018Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits if they be of God,\u2019\u201d Fr. Murray answered. \u201cHas Ms. Martin tried this supposed spirit?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas Ms. Martin expressed any concerns?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I answered. \u201cWhat scares me, Father, are the messages from the spirit that seem contrary to the Faith. Some of its messages have even caused Maud to despair.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Every spirit which confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God: and every spirit that dissolveth Jesus, is not of God,\u2019\u201d Fr. Murray recited. \u201cAre you afraid that the spirit might be evil?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs St. Paul wrote in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, \u2018Satan himself transformeth into an angel of light,\u2019\u201d Fr. Murray recited. \u201cIt is certainly possible that the spirit, if there is one, could be evil.\u201d\n\nA chill went up my spine.\n\nStammering, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand, Father. Why would an evil spirit be attracted to Maud? She\u2019s one of the holiest people I know.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn evil spirit would be attracted to Maud because of her holiness. Satan does not want sinners, whom he has already claimed, but saints, so they will be separated from God forever, like he is,\u201d Fr. Murray answered. \u201cHer condition makes her even more susceptible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cEvil lies in wait. It waits for an invitation. The purpose of demonic obsession and oppression is to break an individual down and possess them. Maud makes an ideal candidate for demonic oppression. She is not only holy, but she is dying. She is easier to break, because she grows weaker\u2013physically, mentally, spiritually\u2013by the day. An individual must be broken, a crack must form in their soul, for the smoke of Satan to enter in.\u201d\n\nAs we concluded our conversation, Fr. Murray assured me he would discuss the matter with the Bishop. I left the parish office, and I bicycled back to my apartment building. Entering Maud\u2019s apartment, I saw her in bed, praying silently. She had a pallor to her skin, and her legs and feet were mottled with purple splotches. Her pulse was fast and her breathing was shallow. She did not have much time left. I walked toward her, and she flinched when I placed my hand on her shoulder. She opened her eyes, and she looked frightened.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s me, Maud,\u201d I answered. \u201cRhiannon.\u201d\n\n\u201cKitty?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s Kitty.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe came to me again,\u201d Maud said. \u201cMother. . . .\u201d\n\nAs she trailed off, I asked, \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018It is almost finished,\u2019\u201d Maud recalled. \u201c\u2018Soon you will receive your reward.\u2019\u201d\n\nBefore I was able to say anything, Maud cried out, \u201cMother, help me. . . . Please, stay with me, please.\u201d\n\nI started to cry as I listened to her pleas for her Lady to stay. Placing a chair at her bedside, I sat down, and I held her hand in mine.\n\n\u201cRhiannon,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d\n\nAs tears trickled down my cheeks, I was torn between belief and disbelief \u2014 *Was she receiving visions of the Blessed Mother, or was she being deluded by Satan?* I did not know. I wanted to beg her to hold on, but what if I would only prolong her suffering?\n\nMaud looked over at me, and she whispered, \u201cOne more Rosary?\u201d\n\nWith tears in my eyes and a quiver in my voice, I nodded, and said, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nMaud and I started to pray the Rosary. In the middle of one of our Hail Marys, a brilliant light enveloped Maud\u2019s bedroom. The familiar lustre in her eyes returned as she prayed, \u201cHoly Mary, Mother of God, pray for us, poor sinners. . . . Poor sinners. . . .\u201d\n\nAs she sat up in bed slightly, Maud announced, \u201cShe\u2019s here.\u201d\n\nAnd I was able to see her.\n\nTo my astonishment, I was able to see the form of a woman, who was dressed in a white gown with a blue mantle and sash, her face obscured by the brilliance of the light surrounding her.\n\nAlthough I could not see her face, I was able to hear her say, \u201cCome and receive your reward, good and faithful servant.\u201d\n\nWith a dreamy smile on her face, Maud collapsed onto her pillow, lifeless and limp.\n\nShe was dead.\n\nThrough tears, I looked at the Lady before she faded away completely into the light. At her feet, which were covered by the bottom of her gown, roses, lilies, and violets bloomed, but in the centre of the bouquet, there was a sprig of belladonna flowers.\n\nAlthough I saw and heard everything with my own eyes and ears, I was still consumed by doubt. *Was it true?* I did not know. *Was it false?* I did not know. *What did I know?* I had no answers for the questions I asked, and I was racked with sobs over Maud\u2019s body.\n\nA week later, Fr. Murray celebrated Maud\u2019s Funeral Mass at our parish, and she was buried in the adjoining cemetery. The mourners dispersed soon after her coffin was lowered into the earth, but I remained at her grave to say goodbye.\n\nAs I prepared to leave, I heard a voice in the wind.\n\nIt sounded like the Lady.\n\n\u201cRhiannon. . . .\u201d\n\n*Could it be?*\n\nI turned around, but I could not see anyone else in the graveyard.\n\n*Mother Mary?*\n\nWhen I turned back around to Maud\u2019s grave, I saw a fresh sprig of belladonna flowers placed on her headstone.\n\nAs I pondered the meaning of the beautiful yet poisonous plant, a flood of memories of Maud came over me.\n\nHer battle with despair. Her rapid physical, mental, and spiritual decline. Her immense suffering. Her lonely death, abandoned and forsaken by the world.\n\nAll of it began when she started seeing a beautiful Lady, who would never show her face, even to her.\n\nI felt paralysed as a familiar voice spat directly into my ear.\n\n\u201cYou could never have saved [her](https://reddit.com/r/TheWelshWitch).\u201d",

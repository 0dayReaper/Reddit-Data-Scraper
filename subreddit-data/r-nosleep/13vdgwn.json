    "postText": "Hi\u2026\n\nI\u2019m new to reddit. So, I guess a little about me: F/34/LA.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure how to start this. Or what I hope to get out of it. Help, I guess. And I know it\u2019s a shot in the dark but I\u2019m just hoping that maybe there\u2019s someone out there who\u2019s dealt with something similar? It sounds insane to talk about out loud to anyone other than close friends or family and as for my close friends and family\u2026 well, for reasons that will become apparent let\u2019s just say I can\u2019t really talk to my friends and family about this. So if you have any advice I\u2019d really appreciate it because I\u2019m getting pretty fucking desperate at this point. And I don\u2019t have a lot of time left before she comes to visit.\n\nShe. Sorry. I mean Melissa. At least, I thought that was her name. Now I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I was literally living my best life. Not how people say it as a joke. Like, actually. I\u2019d had some tumultuous years in my late teens/early 20\u2019s but those ups and downs were all behind me. I\u2019d accepted some hard truths and settled into a life that I\u2019d worked hard for. My on-off boyfriend of 13 years finally popped the question (if I\u2019d had it my way we would\u2019ve been married a decade ago). So I was just enjoying being newly engaged. My best friend flew us out to Paris to celebrate and start looking at dresses in some boutiques there. Life was really, really good.\n\nSo yeah, about my friend. My best friend is a pretty huge actress. She\u2019s like super well known. In fact, whoever\u2019s reading this, I\u2019m actually positive you\u2019ve either seen her work or at the very least know her name/face. She and I, like my now-fianc\u00e9 and I, met in college. We were both majoring in journalism but actually never met in the journalism school. We met in acting class. See my dream was always to be a super-famous actress. It sounds insane now but at the time that was genuinely all I cared about. That dream was legitimately what got me out of bed in the morning. I always saw journalism as my back-up, but even then, I thought my back-up was like being a news anchor or hosting (like Andy Cohen or Maria Menounos vibes). I never thought I\u2019d work behind the camera (which I do now, and I love!). Actually if you went back in time and told 18-year-old me that 34-year-old me would be a line producer on a local news show, 18-year-old me would have probably been suicidal. But anyways. My best friend and I hit it off in acting class freshman year and pretty quickly became inseparable. In a lot of ways, her friendship has saved my life over the years. She means a lot to me.\n\nBut that said, it wasn\u2019t always easy being her friend, when we had the same goals and she had such a leg up. She comes from a family that let\u2019s just say has a lot of resources (without going into detail, to protect her/my identity) and her family had no problem throwing those resources behind her to make it all happen for her in Hollywood. In fact, she ended up dropping out Sophomore year. Staying at school didn\u2019t make sense. She was just getting too many role offers.\n\nSo, yeah. That was hard. I\u2019d taken out massive loans and my parents didn\u2019t have any resources to throw behind me. I was on my own. And by best friend was smooth sailing from role to role, signing with major talent agencies and being spotted with major Hollywood heartthrobs. She didn\u2019t know it, and I\u2019m not proud of it, in fact I\u2019m super embarrassed about it now, but for a while there, I was pretty much extremely, seriously jealous to a dark/unhealthy extent.\n\nSo anyways.\n\nMy best friend and I were walking in to a Parisian boutique to try on a few dresses when I got a text from a number I didn\u2019t recognize.\n\n*\u201cHey girl! I just heard the news, so excited for you and (my fianc\u00e9). Lots of love xxx\u201d*\n\nI\u2019d gotten so many congratulations texts in the week since I\u2019d gotten engaged, I didn\u2019t think anything of it. I was just a bit embarrassed to not have the number saved \u2013 I have a bad habit of not saving numbers \u2013 but nevertheless just responded: \u201c*hey! Thank you so much! I actually just got a new phone and not all of my contacts synced \ud83d\ude48whose number is this?\u201d* The typing bubble popped up\u2026 then vanished. Then popped up\u2026\n\n*\u201cIt\u2019s Melissa! From (university\u2019s name).\u201d* I instantly got a pit in my stomach.\n\nMelissa was someone who I\u2019d very intentionally left in the past.\n\nMelissa and I were also friends from school. But she\u2019d entered my life during a really dark chapter and to be honest, when I think of her, it\u2019s hard not to picture her as the other shoe dropping.\n\nWhen my best friend first left university for Hollywood, I\u2019d gone through a period of intense loneliness. At the same time, my boyfriend (now fianc\u00e9) and I had hit a rough patch \u2013 stupid shit, just juvenile 19-year-old stuff. I was wondering if our relationship had any future at all, really, or if I wanted more out of a partner/relationship. I\u2019d never felt so alone.\n\nAnd then I met Melissa.\n\nShe was extremely charismatic, that\u2019s what first struck me about her. And she listened. As we got to know each other, that\u2019s what a big takeaway was for me. She was the first person in my life who really, truly listened and not only that, wanted to know the answers to the questions she was asking me. And more than that, she never forgot anything.  We\u2019d lay out on the quad for hours, her just letting me vent about my best friend, my boyfriend, my parents, my insanely high-achieving brother. She was fascinated. And the way she looked at me, it was like I was all that mattered to her. Like I was her world.\n\nI know that sounds weird. But for someone like me, who\u2019d never been that important to anyone, it was actually really nice.\n\nThe thing is, I think I told her a little too much.\n\nSee, my boyfriend had really been getting on my nerves (for the reasons above) at that point in my life. Plus, I don\u2019t know, I was young and stupid. Let\u2019s chalk it up to that. But anyways. I\u2019m not proud of what I did. But I did it. I cheated on him with\u2026 let\u2019s call him BRAD\\* (\\*obviously changed the name, not taking the chance that someone who knows us will find this and connect the dots). Brad was just some frat guy I met at a party and honestly, I don\u2019t really know what I was thinking, but we ended up having sex. At first it was just like, a one-time-thing at a party, we were both kind of drunk, whatever. But then it became a way I could somehow sabotage my relationship and fuck up my own life, so of course I kept doing it. I probably cheated on my (now fianc\u00e9) upwards of 30 times over the course of six months with Brad. And the worse part is, a few years later, Brad and I did it again (during my quarter-life crisis). Of course, my fiance to this day has no idea. Yes, we\u2019d dated other people during the times we were \u201coff\u201d again, but we were very much \u201con\u201d during the times I\u2019d slept with Brad and honestly, on some level I was fucking Brad because I was just so angry with my fianc\u00e9 (at that time) and wanted to hurt him.\n\nMelissa always lent an ear to my relationship problems and relished in the stories about Brad. She thought the whole thing was just so scandalous and delicious and asked for every last detail. Of course, I gave them. I was very much with my boyfriend (now fianc\u00e9) and my best friend was off on location too busy to respond to my texts let alone talk for hours, so at this point in my life Melissa was the one person in the whole world I could be honest with.\n\nI also told her a lot, I mean a fucking lot of personal details about my best friend, that she\u2019d shared in confidence. I figured Melissa was like a vault. I\u2019d never tried therapy at that time, but now I know that I was basically treating Melissa like a therapist, as if she\u2019d signed an NDA. I told her about my best friend\u2019s traumas, her ED, her parent\u2019s divorce, private details of her dad\u2019s quirky habits and insane romantic life, her innermost secrets, everything. My dumb 19-year-old ass told myself I was only telling Melissa this as a way to process it all and help me be there for my best friend. And honestly, it did feel good talking it out with someone because my best friend\u2019s lavish upbringing was just sooo foreign to me at the time so Melissa and my gossip-sessions were a way of processing it. But the truth is that I was doing this out of like, some deep dark void inside me. Jealousy. Anger. Disdain. You name it. And whenever I was with Melissa, I felt this darkness growing, like every negative emotion I\u2019d ever had was festering inside and all my insides were turning black like coal.\n\nWhew. Okay. So that\u2019s just the tip of the ice berg, but it\u2019s enough.\n\nSo, you can see why, while sitting in that boutique with my best friend, who\u2019d literally flown me out first class to fucking PARIS, FRANCE and was going to be the maid of honor in my wedding to MY FIANCE, I was extremely disturbed to get a text from Melissa.\n\nI was so freaked out I actually dropped my phone. My best friend rushed to pick it up so I wouldn\u2019t spill my complimentary champagne flute, but I beat her to it. She eyed me, I was definitely acting weird, but after a moment we just went back to looking at dresses. I spent about 20 minutes absentmindedly raving about dresses (while secretly trying to not have a heart attack) before my phone dinged again.\n\n*\u201c(My name)? Are you there?\u201d*\n\nI was actually starting to feel ill at this point. Because there was a lot more I\u2019d told Melissa during our friendship, things that could hurt me, my family, my friends, my relationships. Basically, Melissa was like the one person on earth who had all the ammo she needed to ruin my life. And normally, I\u2019d be like \u2013 who cares? So what? But the thing is, I know she\u2019d do it. I can\u2019t tell you how I know. It\u2019s just a feeling I got from her towards the end of our friendship, before I\u2019d started to distance myself. It was something in her eyes that wasn\u2019t quite right. It was the frothy vigor with which she\u2019d try to get me to open up to her, digging deeper and deeper into the weird web of traumas, lies, and secrets. Mine and everyone else\u2019s.\n\nShe\u2019d really revealed herself towards the end with all the times she\u2019d pushed just a little too hard for info. I wasn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d do with it \u2013 or why \u2013 but I got that feeling in my gut that something wasn\u2019t right. Plus, by the end of our friendship, my best friend\u2019s schedule had calmed down and she was back in my life full-time. And my boyfriend and I had worked through our issues and were actually really happy. So in the end, Melissa became\u2026 baggage. Scary baggage. A liability, actually. Something I had to cut loose. So I did.\n\nMy phone dinged. Melissa, again. *\u201cHello?\u201d*\n\nMy best friend looked over, laughing about how popular I was. \u201cgetting engaged\u2019ll do that to you, I guess.\u201d I tried to laugh, to look calm, but I was not calm.\n\nI figured I\u2019d bite the bullet. \u201cHey, (best friend), do you remember Melissa? From school?\u201d My best friend raised an eyebrow quizzically. \u201cMelissa? Was she a pi phi?\u201d No. Melissa hated sororities. After a few more half-hearted guesses, my best friend shrugged. She didn\u2019t know any Melissa from school.\n\nThat was weird. But I figured, she dropped out sophomore year, before I really started hanging out with Melissa. It made enough sense.\n\nBut later, I asked my fianc\u00e9 if he remembered Melissa from school. Sure, it\u2019s been a decade or so, but he has a pretty stellar memory. But even he was drawing a blank. Nope. No Melissa.\n\nThis is where it started to get weird.\n\nI texted a few friends asking if they knew Melissa from school\u2019s address for a save-the-date (it occurred to me I couldn\u2019t recall Melissa\u2019s last name, which for some reason gave me chills). Literally every single one was like \u201cwho?\u201d Nobody could seem to remember her.\n\nThe weird thing was, I could recall her like I\u2019d just seen her yesterday. I could close my eyes now and see her like she was standing a foot away from me. Tall, skinny, blonde with dark eyes and a button nose. She walked a little funny, with a limp that she said came from a childhood accident, she\u2019d been hit by a car but didn\u2019t like to talk about it. And this intensity behind her eyes. When I first met her it wasn\u2019t there, she was actually pretty childlike with big smile and this goofy-silly-fun energy about her, like a twelve-year-old in a twenty-year-old\u2019s body. But as we got deeper into our weird-intense-co-dependent and semi-fucked up friendship she\u2019d gotten\u2026 darker. By the end, I felt unnerved just being in her presence. Like I had to take a shower after seeing her, almost, it\u2019s hard to put into words, she was just bad vibes. But what was weird about it was when I tried to shake her off and cut her loose, it was easy. Like one day she was just poof, gone out of my life. I can\u2019t say I was very sad about it, either.\n\nDING-DING-DING.\n\nI was trying to enjoy dinner in Paris with my fianc\u00e9 but my phone kept blowing up. It was Melissa again. And again. And again. Her most recent text read: *\u201cI know you\u2019re busy but I need a favor.\u201d*\n\nI turned my phone\u2019s ringer off. But I couldn\u2019t shake the paranoia and anxiety. How did she know I was busy? Did she mean in life, or literally right now, because I was at dinner with my fianc\u00e9? Did she know I was at dinner with him? How could she?\n\nLater that night I figured I had to respond to her, or I\u2019d run the risk of pissing her off. And IDK if you\u2019ve ever been in a situation with someone who could seriously fuck up your life and relationships but you don\u2019t want to piss them off.\n\nI typed: \u201c*Hey, Melissa! So good to hear from you! Sorry for the delayed response, I\u2019m out of the country celebrating my engagement. I\u2019ll be back on my phone soon.\u201d*\n\nMelissa responded immediately, despite the insane time difference. I wasn\u2019t sure where she was living these days, but it must be somewhere in a vastly different time zone, and wherever she was, it had to be an odd hour at that time.\n\n*\u201cWe need to speak in person.\u201d*\n\nFor some reason, a chill ran down my spine. The thought of seeing her face-to-face after all these years\u2026 well, weirdly, I felt like I\u2019d seen her face to face recently. Like, in my dreams. When I closed my eyes. She felt near, in a weird way that I couldn\u2019t quite explain.\n\nI was losing patience but still wanted\u2026 or needed, to tread lightly. I typed: \u201c*what\u2019s this about*?\u201d\n\n*\u201cRemember how I was hit by a car?\u201d*\n\nThis whole thing just kept getting weirder and creepier.\n\n*\u201cyes.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cIt has to do with that.\u201d*\n\nWhat did she want from me? And why was she being so roundabout? She wasn\u2019t threatening me \u2013 again, she didn\u2019t have to, the threat was implied \u2013 but still. I couldn\u2019t quite figure it out.\n\nI told her I\u2019d see her first thing when I got back from Paris. I get back from Paris tomorrow. And I\u2019m feeling\u2026 not great about it, to be honest.\n\nSo yeah. I don\u2019t know what to do. And I\u2019m freaking out.\n\nISO: advice for how to handle this? How to just somehow avoid her and/or not panic about my entire life being ruined?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: thanks for all the advice. Things have taken kind of a weird turn...

            "comment": "So here's what you're going to do:\n\n1. Tell your fiance and best friend that your engagement announcement allowed someone from a low point in your past to contact you. \n\n2. Tell them that that person is someone who you confessed a lot of your shit to, because you didn't feel like you had anyone else because your fiance and BFF were busy.\n\n2a. If they ask \"like what\" tell them it was either your difficulties in processing what your BFF told you during that time (while throwing in what YOU had going on, to imply that your own shit + BFF's was A Lot) and/or drama that arose from people you slept with during your and your fianc\u00e9's rough patch (do not include exact times). Do not give any more specific detail than you need to, just an outline (but make sure you KNOW what outline to tell them, and stay consistent)\n\n2b. If they ask why you told this person and not someone else, explain that Melissa's undivided attention was tempting and soothing and completely new to you (because trauma/neglect i assume??) and that you missed potential red flags because of that, to your chagrin. \n\n3. Make it clear that you had a crisis of conscience/come to Jesus moment and realized you needed/wanted more than what this friend could offer (and/or that she did cross lines that caused you to finally see the red flags) so you broke things off with her. \n\n3a. Admit to them you did it poorly, and could have handled it better, which you regret. However, because of that, you fear that Melissa might be out for revenge. \n\n4.Emphasize to them how much you want their forgiveness and how you have appreciated them/the way they've influenced your life since then. Apologize profusely, and don't hesitate to work in the fact that you were a dumb 19 yr old, and that kind of fawning and love bombing from someone is an effective abuse tactic for a reason. \n\n5. If/when you meet with Melissa, do it in a public place thats familiar to you, and do not go to a secondary location. Make sure someone knows where you are, and secretly record the conversation.  \n\n5a. Let your fiance know that you're doing it, and only because it sounds like she wants to talk about unrelated things and you feel it will provide closure. If he says no, do this next bit by text. \n\n6. At your meeting, start out by thanking her for being there for you when you were younger, then apologize for how you ended things, and finish with a boundary along the lines of \"while I will always appreciate how you helped me, I don't have an interest in restarting our friendship.\"\n\n7. If she insists on telling you about the accident, you are allowed to decline and leave. If you choose to stay, make it clear to her you listening is a one time thing, for old times sake. \n\n8. Wish her all the best, and then leave.",

I broke both of their confidence in horrible ways. Like what I mentioned in this post is just the tip of the iceberg. I\u2019m not going to lie I did/said some really fucked up shit but it was over a decade ago at this point. \nI tried to do what you advised last night, our last night of the trip. We all went to a really nice dinner in paris and I kept telling myself the whole time, im going to do it, im going to tell them when the right time presents itself. But I just had this horrible pit in my stomach to the point of nausea and they noticed I could barely eat but I just made a joke and laughed it off. Every time I tried to start bringing it up, I chickened out to the point of nearly throwing up. I just can\u2019t tell them about this.\nI couldnt help but think as we all laughed and ate amazing food (on my best friends dime) that they have no idea who I really am. Like I tricked them into thinking I\u2019m a good person or something. But also I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just in my head about it. Melissa always had a way of fucking with my self perception especially at the end of our time together. \nWe just landed so I\u2019m going to take a nap but then start some pretty intense stalking of Melissa before I see her Thursday morning. If the accident was as intense/bad as she said it was then there has to be something about it somewhere online or maybe in her home town (agoura, it\u2019s a small suburb so I\u2019m sure someone would know her), I just want to know more about it before she wants to talk about it with me. I\u2019m thinking she might be gearing up for a lawsuit of some kind and wants me to be a part of it, which of course makes me nervous and sounds like a nightmare but not nearly as bad as having my life ruined. And also I have no clue what she\u2019s been up to the last decade so I guess I\u2019ll start on LinkedIn/insta/Facebook first and see what I find.",

Maybe she *is* your dark side.\n\nThe only advice I can think of is to come clean with your fiance.  Don't start your marriage with secrets and lies.  \n\nI wish you luck, and I hope Melissa doesn't plan to harm you in any way.  It's a creepy situation.  How did she get your phone number?  Unless you've had the same number all those years, that's odd.",

I just think that things are so good right now and I finally got him to pop the question and everything\u2019s going smoothly, the last thing we need is something to fuck it all up ://// I really don\u2019t know how she got my number, I got a new number a few years ago (after college). But the whole thing freaks me out, I\u2019ll be honest.\nI\u2019m hoping it all just goes away. Is that so naive?\nI\u2019ll see her Thursday and hear her out. I was mentioning to another commenter that my feeling is she might be gearing up for a lawsuit of some kind and needs a character witness? That\u2019s the only reason I can think of that she\u2019d bring up the accident like that. But also I really don\u2019t know\u2026. There\u2019s something super weird and fucked up about her (why i ended the friendship) and the thought of her knowing all this stuff about me, having everything in hand she needs to ruin my life, right when it\u2019s all going so good, makes me hope this is just about some random lawsuit. You know what I mean?",

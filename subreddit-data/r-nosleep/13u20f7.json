    "postText": "My savior human is distraught. I alone would have trouble enough coping with Kit Sutton's absence, but with Nettie Peterson's grief added to mine, it's been impossible to go about my day with any semblance of serenity.\n\nIt's quite simple; when Nettie's unhappy, I cannot be content. She finally let me visit her earlier today. That doesn\u2019t mean her overall state has improved, though. We went to talk in the garden, only there wasn\u2019t much talking involved\u2014she merely sat in her mother\u2019s chair, staring blankly at the storm-tossed flower chaos. \n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to fix your plants back up?\u201d I inquired.\n\n\u201cM-hm,\u201d she muttered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be a shame if your pretty garden was gonna stay like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cM-hm.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you need help, you let me know, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cM-hm.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t try to eat the geraniums again.\u201d\n\n\u201cM-hm.\u201d\n\nI leaned forward to try and catch her deep brown gaze. \u201cNettie, please say something. I thought we wanted to share our feelings more.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to share,\u201d my savior human answered, her voice dry and monotone. \u201cKit\u2019s not here anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, and I\u2019m upset, too. But either I\u2019m a horribly poor judge of human behavior or there's more to this.\u201d I tilted my head at her. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you this way. You said you didn\u2019t always want a solution to your problems, and I\u2019d be happy to just sit and listen as well, but you\u2019re *not talking* either.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get it, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cClearly not.\u201d\n\nNettie let go of a soft breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t wanna tell you. Not until\u2026 It\u2019s just that in the last couple days, Kit and I were getting kind of\u2026\u201d She faltered and trailed off.\n\n\u201cKind of what?\u201d I prompted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease try, if you can. I want to understand.\u201d\n\nMy best friend refused to meet my gaze. \u201cSee, that\u2019s what I envy you for sometimes. You have an outsider\u2019s perspective. You only see what\u2019s in front of you and you don\u2019t concern yourself with the rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am concerned! I\u2019m *really* concerned about you right now. You\u2019re my best friend, and I\u2019m sorry if I ever made you feel like my caretaker, but I wanna be here for you now. Please. Let me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I know, that\u2019s not what I was saying\u2026\u201d She adjusted her bra strap, her hand coming to rest on her shoulder as though she was hugging herself. \u201cIf there was something I\u2019d kept secret from you\u2014nothing bad, just something personal\u2014would you be mad at me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even imagine being mad at you,\u201d I replied. \n\n\"That's good to know,\" she murmured, finally lifting her head to meet my gaze. \"It doesn't change things for now, but it's\u2026 good to know.\"\n\nAfter that, she fell silent again, and I left not much later. I was setting out for a pretty gloomy rest of the day when Frankie Preston texted me, asking to come hang out at the hotel. I've only stayed at a hotel twice, when Nettie took me on vacation with her. The first time was to Croatia, the other to the south of France. My savior human speaks fluent French. \n\nAnyways, I was glad to follow up on the server's invitation. I won't describe the exact location of the hotel he'd chosen, but it was a fairly nice place. I took Kit Sutton's car there, which definitely gave me a weird feeling. In a way, it was nice. It felt like her. The worn seats, the ancient scent tree, the assortment of guitar picks in the cup holder. The empty takeout bag lying in the footwell. When I pulled up to the hotel parking lot, I was almost reluctant to get out. When I eventually did and entered the lobby, I found that I didn't quite know where to go. I opted to simply walk up to the front desk. There was a man sitting behind it, but he didn't look up from his computer screen upon my approach. \n\n\"Mm-yes?\" he muttered, and it took me a moment to realize he was addressing me. \n\n\"Hi,\" I began. \n\nSomething about my voice must have caught his attention, as he abruptly lifted his head to meet my gaze. \"Hi,\" he echoed, a smile forming on his face. I couldn't help but take note of the silvery gleam of his blond hair. It was long and wavy, tied back behind his head. I wondered how it felt. \"And you are\u2026?\" he prompted, taking me in.\n\n\"Sunshine,\" a voice rang out from behind me. I whirled around, giving Fran a bright smile which, to my delight, he reciprocated. \"You have no idea the kind of acquaintance you just made.\"\n\nI glanced between the two in confusion. The receptionist spoke up first. \"Oh. Oh, I see! This is her, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes. Eva, this is\u2026 one of the many banes of my existence. He's my younger brother, but only in the most remote sense of the word, I assure you.\" The waiter gave the receptionist a look that was somewhere between contemptuous fondness and pure contempt. \n\nThe other man grinned. \"Oh Frankie, my Frankie, you are just the most bitter piece of work there is.\"\n\n\"Younger? You look far older than Frank,\" I remarked. \n\n\"Ouch. But what are looks, really?\" He waved me off. \"And what *is* age with creatures like us? Frankie tells everyone he's twenty-two, I say I'm twenty-seven. We just made up these numbers to match our faces. He's existed for way longer, though. That's probably why he's so miserable.\" He leaned forward, twinkling at me. \"Me, I see the world through fresher eyes.\"\n\nI didn't quite know what to say, so I kept my mouth shut. \n\n\"Frankie, won't you introduce me?\"\n\nThe waiter sighed deeply. \"This is\u2026 Zion. Zion Boyd. I told him it's a perfectly silly name, but he wouldn't listen. I'm glad Rhonda picked mine for me.\"\n\nZion Boyd laughed quietly. \"You're an asshole.\"\n\n\"You're an idiot.\"\n\n\"You wanted to hang out?\" I reminded Fran.\n\n\"Right!\" He grabbed my wrist and began steering me towards the winding flight of stairs in the back of the hall. \"Ignore him. Forget him entirely, if possible. You're not missing out.\u201d\n\nHe brought me up to his suite, a pleasantly large, open space. The tall windows let in the light of the setting sun, painting blushing hues upon the wallpaper. I sat down on the living room couch, switching on the TV not because I was in the mood to watch anything but rather for the background noise. Frankie joined me after a second, placing before me a glass of cold coconut water as he regarded me through thick lashes. \"You got something on your mind, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\"Your brother.\"\n\n\"Aw crap. That smarmy, handsome piece of shit\u2026\" Fran clenched and unclenched his fists repeatedly. \"I knew this would happen.\"\n\n\"What? No. I was wondering about what he said,\" I clarified, shifting uneasily in my seat.\n\nHis hands stilled. \"Oh.\" He smiled brightly. \"Do tell.\"\n\n\"He called you creatures. And there was something else in there about your ages.\"\n\n\"So? What do you think? Any grand theories?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"I could probably try to piece things together. But I'd rather hear it from you.\"\n\n\"Ah, would you. Well, I'm sorry, Sunshine, but it doesn't work like that.\"\n\n\"Don't you think I need to know?\"\n\nHe reached out to poke my sternum with his finger. \"No. I *give you* everything you need. When I decide you need more information, I'll give that to you, too.\"\n\nI frowned at him, but hadn't yet regained the ability to speak when my phone rang. I reluctantly fumbled it out. It was an unknown number, but I recognized the voice that greeted me from the other end. \u201cMary Markov?\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Shirley! Nice talking to you again.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be honest, this is a bad time\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s of no relevance. Remember when I told you I might get back to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d I exchanged meaningful looks with Frankie, who rolled his eyes. He scooted closer to me and pressed his cheek up to mine to listen to the phone call. His skin was almost unnaturally smooth. I swallowed thickly when I felt his jaw working on his bubble gum, moving against mine.\n\n\"Miss Shirley?\" Mary Markov asked. \"Are you still there?\"\n\n\"Did you say something?\"\n\nA sigh. \"Look. You want money, I want your help. Come to the address I\u2019m sending you now. It\u2019s a big parking lot by a hiking trail in the woods. I have business there, and I could use the extra manpower.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now? I\u2019m kind of on a\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can bring the misanthropist with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a misanthropist?\u201d I inquired.\n\n\u201cShe means me,\u201d Fran supplied.\n\n\"She does,\" Miss Markov confirmed.\n\n\"We're coming.\" I ended the call, turning to Frankie. \"That's okay, right? Are you with me?\"\n\n\"Sure. Money's important. It'll be better if you have your own so I won't have to give you mine.\" He got up to collect our jackets. \"At least this way, you won't get stabbed for it.\"\n\nWe took Kit's car over to the meet-up spot. Mary Markov was waiting for us beside a black pickup truck that seemed rather ill-suited for her. She was wearing a blazer, suit pants and dress shoes that were somehow pristine despite the muddy ground. \n\n\"There you are,\" she said, her tone crisp. Pointing her chin at the woods behind her, she added, \"I hope you're ready for a bit of a hike.\"\n\n\"What do you need me for?\" I asked.\n\n\"The Collective you came into contact with. We have reason to believe that they are meeting up here, among other places. There are probably hideouts to be found, and other things, too.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" Fran raised a skeptical brow. \n\n\"The objects you were hired to guard. They're important; we don't rightly know what they are but they're constantly being kept on the move. There's no doubt the Collective wants them to remain obscure, and they're being clever about it.\"\n\n\"And you're hoping we'll go in there unprepared and just stumble across them?\" the waiter inquired.\n\n\"Not exactly. There's a particular member of the cult we've managed to keep our eye on, and we followed her here. She's with at least two others, so we believe they're up to something important,\" Mary Markov explained. \"Go in and find them. When you do, stay low and observe. I'll stay here. If anything goes wrong, call me and I will send for reinforcement.\"\n\n\"Why don't you let your agents go in? Why pull Eva into this? *Again?*\"\n\n\"Frankie, I'm fine,\" I assured him, taking a step towards the newsreader. \"What do I get paid?\"\n\n\"You won't be disappointed in the money,\" she promised, smiling thinly. \"To answer your friend's *legitimate* question\u2014,\" she glanced over at Frank Preston as though she didn't consider his query legitimate at all, \"\u2014you are quite handy. Normally, when humans have to defend themselves and it comes to an altercation, there's\u2026 screams. Blood. Gunshots. Bullets are costly. Personnel even more so. When our agents get hurt, it might take months for them to recover. You don't need that kind of time. You're altogether less likely to be injured fatally. Employing you might end up saving us some lives and we'll be sure to make it worth your while.\"\n\nThat's, in short, why I found myself trudging through the mud and brushes alongside a very grudging Frank Preston that night. The storm had taken its toll in the woods, too\u2014our chaotic surroundings reminded me of a larger-scale version of Nettie's garden. Trees had been uprooted and were lying dead in our path like organic roadblocks. The ground was covered with broken branches, twigs and young leaves. The wet soil squashed beneath our shoes every step of the way. With nightfall approaching, there was not much light reaching the forest floor. This certainly protected us from visibility, but it came at the price of my vision. I couldn't really see what was beneath me, so I kept tripping and staggering.\n\nFrankie was somehow as graceful as ever, unbothered as he stepped over roots and rocks as if he could sense them before placing his feet. He was much quieter than me, but he thankfully wasn't smug about it. He kept one hand steady on my shoulder, aptly guiding me away from obstacles and protrusions. After a while, this began to work very well, and I became less noisy the deeper we proceeded into the woods. The server\u2019s grip suddenly turned painfully tight, stopping me in my tracks. I realized why when I caught a glimpse of brightness not too far ahead. My chest tightened when I spotted the beam of a flashlight traveling the forest floor. \n\n\u201cHush,\u201d Frankie murmured into my ear. \u201cDon\u2019t. Move.\u201d\n\nI stood stock-still, trusting the fingers still digging into my skin. \n\nThe light passed over us, nearly reaching us but not quite. I breathed a silent sigh of relief, which died in my throat when a familiar voice carried over to us on the breeze.\n\n\u201cHurry up already, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t stress me. Why aren\u2019t you helping?\u201d a young woman replied. \n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s *your* fucking job.\u201d\n\nI felt myself break into a cold sweat. My heart was thumping so fiercely it was beginning to hurt; my pulse racing. Breaking from my rigor, I leaned over to whisper to Frankie. \u201cThat\u2019s them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one who stabbed me.\u201d\n\nFran\u2019s hand disappeared from my shoulder, moving down to quickly grasp mine. The pair before us was still on the move, the light of their torch slowly fading into the distance. \u201cListen to me,\u201d my partner proceeded to hiss into my ear. \u201cThere\u2019s two of them and two of us, but technically it\u2019ll just be you. I\u2019m not gonna leave you on your own, but the most I can do is hold one of them down.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re strong\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t actually *hurt* anybody. I gladly would, but it\u2019s literally physically impossible for me. Do you still want to follow them?\u201d\n\nI paused. I didn\u2019t want to. In fact, every fiber of my being was yelling at me to run, to get out of those woods, and yet\u2026 \u201cWe have to.\u201d\n\nA sigh. \u201cI really feel like I ought to talk you out of this.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf things get dire, I\u2019ll grab you and bail.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll allow it. I\u2019m still doing this.\u201d\n\n\u201cGuess I was wrong. You might get stabbed for your pay this time around, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is bigger than just money, Fran.\u201d\n\nHis hand wandered back to my shoulder, nudging me forward. \u201cI know. You want to tear this creep apart.\u201d\n\nI paused. \u201cIf Markov asks, we didn\u2019t plan on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally, some murderous tendencies in that sunny mind of yours.\u201d The cheer in Frankie\u2019s voice was only a little forced.\n\nI steeled myself as we took up walking once more. Soon enough, we caught up with the two cultists, trailing behind them at a safe distance. I could hear the faint scraping of a wheelbarrow on the uneven ground. The eerie creaking noise was enough to speed up my heartrate once more. Frankie\u2019s words still echoing through my mind, my thoughts were racing. A part of me was convinced I was making a terrible mistake, but there was something driving me on. Whether it was curiosity, an underlying thirst for revenge or illusions of grandeur, I\u2019ll never know. Yet forwards I went. Abruptly, the pair stopped, the wheelbarrow grating to a halt. Frankie instantly dragged me down to hide behind a dead, uprooted tree, and not one second too soon. \n\nThe beam of the flashlight roamed the underbrush, its owners remaining blissfully unaware of our presence. \u201cHere we are,\u201d the person who\u2019d attacked me spoke up again.\n\n\u201cWoah,\u201d the woman pushing the cart answered eloquently. Whatever they were looking at was undoubtedly rather impressive. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never been here before, have you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2026 Does it go as deep as they say?\u201d\n\n\u201cDeeper. It\u2019s a whole-ass tunnel system down there. We\u2019ve spent *years* prepping for this, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay. Whew. Well then, off we go. Can you help me lift him up, at least?\u201d\n\nThe other person groaned. \u201cFine.\u201d\n\nFrankie Preston had grabbed my arm. The distant shine from the cultists\u2019 torch bathed him in an almost unearthly glow. He was cowering beside me with tense shoulders, his face a cold, concentrated mask. He wasn\u2019t even chewing on his gum anymore. His wired posture reminded me of a lurking wildcat in a nature documentary. When he turned to look at me, I could almost tell what he was thinking. \n\nWhatever these two had come here to do, it was happening now, meaning that this was our last chance to intervene.\n\nTrying to free my mind from all thoughts of flight, I rose to my feet. Step by step, I made my way out of our hiding spot, instantly drawing the pair\u2019s attention. Two heads whipped around to face me. The flashlight dropped and rolled a little ways across the ground, its wide beam illuminating the small clearing and revealing the reason for the cultists\u2019 venture. There was a dark hole in the ground at our feet, the opening reminiscent of a gaping, toothless maw. My gaze wandered over to the pushcart. Its bulky contents were covered by a large, green tarp. The tall, lanky person slowly raised their hands to their hips, uttering a low, mildly surprised \u201chuh\u201d. The woman, who was stockier and far shorter in stature than them, stood frozen in shock. The eyes that stared at me from behind her black mask were blown wide. \n\n\u201cHey you,\u201d the tall one said. \u201cI had a feeling we\u2019d meet again soon.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t respond. My stomach suddenly burned with a phantom pain. I couldn\u2019t tear my eyes from the person\u2019s gloved hands, trying not to jump when their fingers twitched into the direction of their pocket. Trying to keep my breathing steady, I reached up to unzip my jacket. As it fell to the ground, I felt my tentacles pierce my skin. Simultaneously, my teeth began to elongate, curving outward as they uncomfortably stretched out my gums. \n\n\u201cI had a feeling something like this was gonna happen, too,\u201d my former assailant added, tilting their head at me. \u201cI do love being right.\u201d\n\nThe woman, who had been stunned speechless up to that point, let out an ear-shattering scream, but before anything coherent could emerge from her throat, the other person had spun around and struck her square across the face. The blow had come with such force that she crumbled immediately, her shriek dying in a strangled whimper before she hit the ground unconscious. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing. My mind was spinning, but I forced my eyes to remain hard, praying that my large fangs were twisting my face enough to veil my terror. I lifted myself over the fallen tree, partly employing my extra limbs. The cultist didn\u2019t shrink away, instead taking a large step towards me. Before I knew it, the surface of their mask was scraping against my teeth. Too startled to move, I held their gaze for several seconds. Up close, I could see the only part of them that wasn\u2019t obscured. \n\nThere was something very, very wrong with their eyes. \n\nAt first, I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it. Their iris was of a pale, watery color that could not quite be defined as blue. Their surreal milky sheen was enough to send a chill up my spine. And then I realized it. *There were only the irises.* That black dot that all humans and most other known lifeforms typically have in their eyes, the pupil, it simply wasn\u2019t there. \n\nI stood rooted to the ground, staring into the stranger\u2019s eyes. I thought I could see different colors swirling around in those not-quite-blue orbs. I was abruptly noticing a sudden inability to move on my part. I wanted to lift my arm and shove the cultist away, I wanted to unhinge my jaw and sink my teeth into their flesh, but I *couldn\u2019t*. I was distantly aware of the heavy rising and falling of my chest, of my heart thundering in my ribcage, but it didn\u2019t feel real somehow. Nothing felt real anymore. The world had turned iridescently turquoise and violent, flashing lights dotting my vision as my breathing grew quicker. \n\nSomewhere in the back of my head, the last waking part of me was screaming. \n\nAnd then, all of a sudden, everything turned dark again. I blinked furiously, trying to orient myself as the outlines of trees and bushes swam into focus again. The sweet smell of pine needles and damp soil hit me as I emerged from the hypnotic half-slumber. Before me, ramrod straight, stood Frankie Preston, and somehow, the sight of him had triggered the flight instinct in the cultist I had failed to provoke. Our eye contact broken, they staggered back, just as Fran stepped aside. This time, I didn\u2019t throw away my shot. I threw myself at the stranger, lunging forward with my teeth bared. They dodged me by a hair\u2019s breadth, bolting towards the manhole and, within a split second, they had disappeared down the pitch-black shaft. No sound of impact met our pricked ears. \n\nFrankie wordlessly took out his phone, proceeding to place the call to Mary Markov. He walked over to me as they talked, grabbing my hand with his free one and pumping it almost rhythmically like he was trying an unconventional method of resuscitation. His voice and that of the newsreader on the other end sounded strangely far away. After hanging up, he hastily typed something before finally shoving the device back into his pocket. With an almost methodical precision, he wrapped his arms around me and picked me up, holding me close to his chest. My tentacles were hanging limply from my back as my teeth slowly began to reassume their normal size and length. Entangling my trembling fingers in his curls, I must have looked absolutely pitiful. The server sat down on the fallen tree, his grip on me unfaltering as I adjusted to sit on his lap, feeling myself unwind. \n\nWe remained like this, not speaking, until we heard steps draw closer. Mary Markov and two of her agents were walking towards us at a speedy pace, the newsreader crouching down in front of us while the two men immediately took to the unconscious female cultist. \n\n\u201cYou were in here for quite a while,\u201d she began, her voice drifting in and out of my ears while Frankie\u2019s soothing touch curled around the edge of my senses. \u201cI had a feeling something had gone wrong, so I\u2019d already sent for backup. Good thing, too, I guess.\u201d Her voice held a barely hidden note of accusation.\n\n\u201cLeave her be. She\u2019s obviously in no condition to speak,\u201d the waiter growled.\n\nI would have confirmed this, but I was in no condition to speak. \n\nMary sighed. \u201cNevermind then, we\u2019ll discuss this later. For now, let\u2019s check what they were transporting.\u201d\n\nI patted Fran on the back to alert him.\n\n\u201cFeeling curious? Even after all of this?\u201d\n\nI nodded into his nape. \n\nA grunt. \u201cWell, fine. Not like this could have gone any worse, huh.\u201d He stood up and walked us over to the wheelbarrow, closely followed by Mary. The newsreader inspected the tarp, then grabbed one corner and flung it off the cart. A sharp gasp escaped her and I craned my neck to look. Frankie instantly turned around, trying to avert my eyes from the sight that had just been revealed to us, but it was too late. I had already seen the contents. The headless body lying folded in the barrow.\n\nA human with their head removed doesn't look entirely human anymore. I could tell from the stature that it was a male body, but its condition made him feel less like a person. I couldn't help drawing this distinction, even though it made my stomach turn. Rigor mortis having washed over the carcass, he was in a bent, twisted position that would have been painful to anyone still alive. One of his arms, freed from the tarp, was dangling loosely over the side of the cart. One of Mary\u2019s agents gagged and covered his mouth. I shot him a sympathetic glance, though I don\u2019t think he caught it. I was too tired to scream or throw up. Thus quenching any visceral reaction to the gruesome sight, I buried my face in Fran\u2019s shirt once more, closing my eyes.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13dr5g0/help_im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[2: deadbeat roommate](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13eovqy/im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_also_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[3: creepy crush](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13fnc4u/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_everyone/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[4: relocation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13gjpwd/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_does_anybody/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[5: beach concert](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13heih5/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[6: First date](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ib2es/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_my_first/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[7: Temp work](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ja7jx/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_temp_work/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[8: roommate talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13k8088/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_a_talk_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[9: a dismal worldview](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13l69a9/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_the_world/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[10: warehouse](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13m8e9w/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[11: staircase](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13o0npw/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_we_visited_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[12: explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13p2dw3/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_we_might/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[13: hurt](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13q2hrx/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_i_should_not/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[14: hospital](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13r0f31/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_i_dont_like/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[15: ocean](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13s762l/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_the_day_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[16: diner](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13t8gny/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_i_may_have/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[18: something in the caves](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ux5n8/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_theres/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

There is this dumb thing in the mind that makes you afraid people will hate you for it despite there being absolutely no evidence suggesting they will.  I speak from experience here (although I'm not a lesbian I'm pretty sure it's the exact same)\n\n2. Fran is a robot.  The whole asminove's law of robotics fits. Truth be told I'd been suspecting this for a hot minute \n\n3. No fucking clue what's up with the hole but it probably involves Kit. The reason I say this is that kit specified that she had just been talking shit to the crab that was following her and that it had not been a summoning and Mary said the collective was doing summoning.\n\nLast thing I'll say. Fuck the people saying don't trust Fran.  If he wanted harm to come to you it would have by now. He's been by your side through thick and thin, mostly thick(because that's the bad one right? I'm not 100% sure which is the bad one so mostly the bad stuff) and he very clearly has your back",

He is using you, Eva!  He wants you to help him end humanity.  \n\nIdea, take him to a SA survivor place thing. Sometimes they're full clinics, sometimes more of a resource center. He should know that there are many humans that care about consent and autonomy.  Also Star Trek TNG marathon is in order. I suggest the Data centric episodes if you can't do all 7(?) seasons. It will show him that people were thinking of the rights of his kind when he was merely a wish.  \n\nI begging you. Please, I'm not ready to die. At least delay him until I can get a girlfriend? If humanity is going out, I want a cuddle first.",

He knows what Fran is and that terrifies him.\n\nAlso, if Fran is a robot then he can't be hypnotized which could also explain the fear and reaction to Fran. I kind of feel like Fran CAN'T tell Eva what he is because of how he's programmed, the same way he can't harm a person.",

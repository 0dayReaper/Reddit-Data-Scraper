    "postText": "________\n\nIt\u2019s morning. Or at least I believe it to be morning somewhere outside these metal walls. \n\n\nAbout seven hours [ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13l2qf8/im_trapped_in_a_basement_elevator_alongside/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=15) or so, I saw another person disappear from this elevator. Her name was Amanda, and something beyond comprehension killed her. \n\nSince that time I have been in and out of consciousness, trying to let my body heal. The second fall from above rattled me, and it left me thinking that escape from this nightmare might be impossible. \n\nI have come to terms with the fact that powers beyond what I understand are at work here. Creatures,  supernatural beings that probably defy explanation. There isn\u2019t another explanation to the craziness we have experienced so far. \n\nBut that alone is not what is frightening me. A few of the strangers I have met in this place fought for their lives and lost. \n\nPhil the maintenance man looks like he is next. \n\nI watched over the next few hours as Sidney helped him and kept an eye on the unconscious army private. The crushed hand will likely cause blood clots and more problems down the line but for now the focus is on Phil. We have taken his gun and belongings away, using the small supplies to keep our bodies alive. \n\n As the maintenance man struggled to breathe she found a way to keep him upright against the left wall, away from where tissue and flesh on the elevator floor were still slipping into the tiny hole the sludge burned. \n\n I can\u2019t help wonder if he will make it. \n\nI close my eyes again to heal, listening to their moans of pain as sleep comes. \n\nOnce I was awake, I scooted the few feet that separated us and looked into Nick\u2019s bag to see what else might help us. \nI also  wonder if he will wake up and if we will ever find out his story. \n\nPhil wakes up next and asks if there is any water. There is but it isn\u2019t much. \n\nI offer it to him anyway. \n\nPhil took it and commented, \u201cThanks... It feels like I\u2019ve been hit by a freight train\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cCareful. We\u2019ll have to share that,\u201d I said. \n\nI\u2019m already parched. Realizing we have been here for days with little food and water has me feeling the weight of our situation. There really isn\u2019t enough to make sure we can survive for longer than a few more days. If we even last that long. \n\n\u201cMaybe the worst is over,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 says, trying to remain optimistic. Her once well organized outfit is messy and torn because of the things we have endured. \n\nI don\u2019t want to be unrealistic, so I don\u2019t respond and instead look at the door where Amanda was literally eaten alive. \n\nA dark thought has crossed my mind since her disappearance: The others have made no mention of her. As if they can\u2019t recall. I decide to test the theory and ask Phil how many people he remembers in the elevator before the drop. \n\n\nPhil scratched his chin and gave a good look at my face. \u201cI can\u2019t say I remember for sure. But I meet a lot of people working here,\u201d he said. \n\nI shook my head and tried to calm myself. I need to voice my concerns to the others. \n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in this elevator for about three days now. There were seven of us. Now there are only five. Do you remember any of this?\u201d I asked. \n\nI watched his reaction for any sign that he was lying or pretending. But once again he showed genuine terror as he realized as well his mind was slipping away. \n\n\u201cI would think that I could remember all of that. Has it really been three days? Shouldn\u2019t our phones all be dead by now?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful for the little things we have, it\u2019s what keeps us going,\u201d I said as I checked my percentage. \nMine sits at 37% and Chlo\u00e9 tells me hers is at 4% when she wakes up. We have kept them powered off and hardly use them for anything other than notes. Chlo\u00e9 has chosen to leave that obligation to me, I suspect because she doesn\u2019t want to grapple with more stress. \n\nSidney was awake now as well and after a short conversation with them I have confirmed they have no memory of Amanda or the girl. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see Phil is better,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 remarked. \n\n\u201cI did what I could,\u201d Sidney said with a shrug. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an amazing nurse, especially since the psychopath over here seems fine,\u201d I said looking the unconscious soldier. \n\n\u201cWe need to decide what to do about him,\u201d Phil told us. \n\nThe air in the room feels menacing and I ask him to clarify. \n\n\u201cHe has been a loose cannon from the start. And we don\u2019t even know why he is here. Everything about him screams that he\u2019s dangerous. I think he is hiding something\u2026 and I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t believe you before,\u201d he adds. \n\n\u201cWait. Are you saying we should interrogate him?\u201d Chlo\u00e9 asks in surprise. \n\n\u201cHe has refused to give up any information willingly. And he nearly killed me yesterday. I think we all have a right to know what the heck he is doing here,\u201d Phil decided. \n\n\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t cooperate\u2026?\u201d Sidney wonders. \n\n\u201cWe do what has to be done,\u201d Phil orders. \n\nNone of us are comfortable with this plan but we agree to it anyway. \n\nWe wait for him to fully recover, making sure his body is restrained using the loose material of his army jacket as rope. \n\nWhen Nick finally wakes, he is on one side of the elevator near the door and we are on the other and it doesn\u2019t take him long to realize that he\u2019s under scrutiny. \n\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Sidney asked. \n\nNick looks down at his body and then toward the makeshift sling that she placed around his left arm. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t feel anything\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cPain will return. You are still in shock,\u201d she tells him. \n\nHe next realizes I have his gun. \n\n\u201cWhat are you planning to do with that, Eli?\u201d he asks icily. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just going to talk,\u201d I said as I pass it to Phil. \n\n\u201cThis is the thanks I get for trying to do what is necessary,\u201d he mutters. \n\n\u201cYou almost shot me in the head you fucker! What the hell is wrong with you?\u201d Phil asks. \n\n\u201cI had no idea if you were going to live. I was trying to do what I thought was right,\u201d Nick admits. \n\n\u201cLike how you lied about the gun in the first place? I\u2019m sure the journal is in there too, in that briefcase.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t open that case. Not here,\u201d Nick demands. \n\nHe sounds frightened when he says it and it makes me uneasy. \n\nI sat closer to him. \n\n\u201cWhat were you planning on doing with this gun,  Nick?\u201d\n\nHis eyes darted to the side. He doesn\u2019t want to answer. Guilt is written all over his face. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to answer you,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cYes you do. Because here\u2019s what I think. I think you are the one that wanted us here to begin with,\u201d Phil said, waving the gun in his face. \n\n\u201cYour journal, it had a note with my name on it. How did you know my name Nick?\u201d I asked. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t respond and I sighed in frustration. He has decided to do this the hard way. \n\nI ball my fist up and hit him hard against the face. \n\n\u201cAnswer me damn it,\u201d I said. \n\nBut the soldier is  as stoic as ever. \n\nChlo\u00e9 and Sidney can\u2019t watch as Phil and I begin our intense interrogation. \n\nI can\u2019t even believe what I did as I take the man\u2019s hand and began to bend his fingers backward. But Nick is stubborn. He says nothing at all as we torture him. \n\nI can tell after a while though that he is breaking, sweating bullets as we demand answers and push the limits of what we are capable of. Of what we allow ourselves to do to him. \n\nI did things I can\u2019t even admit now. I want to forget the way his eyes looked hollow as we slapped and punched  him against the face again and again. Blood and tears streaming down his bruised cheeks.  \n\n\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d Phil demanded. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got me all figured out right? Why don\u2019t you tell me,\u201d Nick said, spitting on the floor near the maintenance man\u2019s shoes. \n\nBefore Phil can respond by slamming the butt of the gun against his head, the lights in the elevator come back on again. All of us freeze because we anticipate that the monster is about to attack again. \n\nBut it never happens. Instead as I look up I suddenly realize that the hatch to the elevator shaft itself has been dislodged and I can see a faint glimmer of light on the other side. \n\n\u201cHoly shit\u2026 we might have a way out of here,\u201d I said as I pointed to the hatch. \n\n\u201cWe were ascending for a pretty long time earlier, it would be a helluva climb for all of us\u2026\u201d Chlo\u00e9 paused and looked toward Phil, an unspoken truth clear to all of us. If we did attempt to get out of the hatch, he wouldn\u2019t be able to make the climb at all. \n\n\u201cThen just one of us should go. We have to at least give it a try,\u201d Phil says. He sounds resigned and defeated. I know he is tired from everything we have done to Nick. \n\nSidney looks nervous about the idea of attempting to leave the elevator. \n\n\u201cThat creature is right outside. We could be swallowed up the second we climb,\u201d she says. \n\nNone of us are eager to experience the same pain that Nick had felt when his arm was crushed. \n\n\u201cWe flip a coin then. Just the three of us,\u201d I said, turning to the two women. It\u2019s obvious we are the only ones physically capable of making the climb and after a short awkward silence they agree. \n\nWe use rock paper scissors to decide which of us will be at the top of our human ladder. Sidney is the unlucky winner, although her expression tells me she is terrified of what might lie beyond the relative safety of the elevator. \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to do this. Maybe we should just keep waiting,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 suggests. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s past time for that. This thing will kill us if we stay here or we will starve to death. No rescue is going to find us,\u201d Phil said. I\u2019m surprised to hear his dismal outlook. But I know he is right. If we are going to survive we have to attempt to make an escape. \n\nThis time we use the backpack as a stabilizer for the bottom of the human ladder. Nick doesn\u2019t offer his support but given how injured he is I\u2019m not sure he would be able to help even if he wanted to. \n\nPhil and I form the base this time and Chlo\u00e9 is the middle. Sidney slowly ascends and reached the top in only a matter of seconds. But it feels like an agonizing eternity. \n\nI struggle to keep myself from collapsing as I look up to see the nurse fit her tiny hand into the open hatch and she feels around for anything that might pry it loose. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t get it! It won\u2019t budge!\u201d she says and Phil shouts for her to try again. \n\n\u201cI can hold a little longer. Please try to open it,\u201d he demands. \n\nSidney is literally leaning her full body weight toward the hatch to try and get it open. \n\nThen I heard a strange hissing noise. At first I thought it was the monster. \n\n\u201cI got it! I think I got it!\u201d Sidney said as the hatch fell open. \n\nAbove our heads strange purple mist began to cascade from the open hole into the elevator as I instinctively held my breath for dear life. \n\nImmediately though I began to feel lightheaded. I could hardly keep myself from feeling faint. The others below began to lose their balance. \n\nI saw Sidney trying to pull herself up through the mist covered hole but it was clear her strength was waning. \n\nThen Chlo\u00e9 lost her grip and Sidney was dangling onto the ceiling with every last bit of power she had. \n\nAround me I heard the others collapse from the mist and I couldn\u2019t see if she made it. \n\nSomething told me deep in my gut told me either way our problems were far from over.\n\n[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13mzgy4/im_trapped_in_a_basement_elevator_alongside/?)",

Feel so lousy for saying I want updates about your lousy situation. If Nick doesn\u2019t want that case open, sounds like may be an explosive inside. He is definitely sketchy. Has to be some reason he had your names down.  Wishing everyone the best but nervous wore you. I wonder why your memories are intact OP?",

    "postText": "I used to work at a reputable audit company. Those familiar with me will recognize the company. I'm certain my colleagues will come across this on Reddit, as I've seen them browse the site during office hours.\r  \n\r  \nIt's been approximately two days since the incident, and I can't shake the feeling of being watched. Each passing night, the shadows in my room seem to grow darker and have more substance. I fear I'm losing my sanity.\r  \n\r  \nMy fellow coworkers, as you read this, I'm uncertain if I'll still be alive. However, please, heed my warning. You must put an end to this curse before it's too late.\r  \n\r  \nIt happened on the night of June 23rd. It was around 11 PM, and anyone passing by the office building would have noticed that only the lights on the third floor were on. My colleague Awais and I were the only ones working late, as we had an upcoming deadline and, thus, had some unfinished tasks. It wouldn't be fair to solely blame us for the delay, as our client had taken their sweet time in providing the necessary data. Such was the life of an auditor.\r  \n\r  \nMy fingers glided across the keyboard of my laptop, the sound of typing echoed through the empty floor. Both of us were surviving on caffeine at this point, evident from the scattered paper cups on the table.\r  \n\r  \nIn the midst of entering an Excel formula, a faint scraping sound caught my attention. I had paused briefly to double-check my calculations, and that's when I heard it. As soon as I paid attention to it, it abruptly stopped. I looked up from my laptop, surveying the dimly lit office, but found no source for the sound. Awais, sitting to my right, seemed too busy with his work to notice. Shaking my head, I returned to my tasks, convinced that I had simply imagined it. However, as I looked back at the laptop screen, the scraping noise resumed, faint but distinct.\r  \n\r  \nI immediately stood up, and once again, the sound stopped. I scanned the room and heard Awais making a strange noise. I turned toward him, and he burst into laughter.\r  \n\r  \n\"Bruh, you should have seen your face,\" Awais said, struggling to contain his amusement.\r  \n\r  \n\"Dude, that scared the hell out of me. Don't pull such pranks when we're up against a deadline.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Yeah, yeah. You definitely need some sleep. You're losing it right now.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"I'll get some rest once I finish this,\" I replied, plopping back into my chair and letting out a sigh.\r  \n\r  \n\"I hate my job.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Not much longer, right? This is our last day. Do you think our replacements will be able to complete this?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Probably. We gave them a thorough briefing about the work earlier.\"\r  \n\r  \nI looked at Awais, and he slowly closed his laptop.\r  \n\r  \n\"You're leaving, huh?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"I have a lot on my mind right now. I need to take a step back.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Sure, I'll probably leave in a few minutes as well. You go ahead.\"\r  \n\r  \nAwais started gathering his belongings, and in the midst of packing, he asked, \"Have you heard from Asjad Bashir? He left the company a week ago, and we haven't heard a word from him.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Same here. I've tried contacting him multiple times, but his phone was turned off.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"You think it's related to that rumored curse?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Nonsense. Do you believe in such things?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"I don't, but lately, it seems more than just a rumor, doesn't it? They say those who leave the company vanish.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Asjad not answering our calls would definitely have a logical explanation, rather than some absurd curse. He did say that his phone was causing all sorts of problems before he left\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Sure, but what about Sarah and Ahmed?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"They both had plans to move to China, so it's possible that they haven't had a chance to reach out to us yet.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Junaid, it's been three months, and Ahmed, your work buddy, hasn't even contacted you.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"I understand that his silence is bothering you, but I have faith that he will eventually get in touch with us.\"\r  \n\r  \nAwais didn't seem satisfied with my response. He stared blankly at the vacant office space.\r  \n\r  \n\"Don't worry about anything. You'll be fine. That rumor is just a tactic to keep us in the company,\" I assured him, giving his shoulder a pat.\r  \n\r  \n\"I want to believe that too. Anyway, I'm leaving now. Let's grab lunch sometime and talk shit about this company again,\" Awais said weakly, letting out a faint laugh.\r  \n\r  \n\"Sure thing, buddy.\"\r  \n\r  \nWe shook hands firmly, and Awais picked up his bag, heading towards the elevator. The doors closed, plunging the space into darkness once again, I returned to my desk and resumed my work.\r  \n\r  \nAbout 20 minutes later, I stretched my arms.\r  \n\r  \n\"Man, the newbies are going to have a field day with this assignment.\"\r  \n\r  \nI closed my laptop, preparing to pack up. I gathered the empty paper cups and tossed them into the nearby bin.\r  \n\r  \nAs I stood by the elevator, I took one last glance at the empty office.\r  \n\r  \n\"Never thought I'd witness this day, especially not after four years of being here.\"\r  \n\r  \nWith that, I stepped into the elevator. The doors closed, and the descent began, the floor numbers gradually ticking down from three.\r  \n\r  \nSurprisingly, the elevator jolted and came to a sudden stop.\r  \n\r  \n\"Well, that was quicker than expected,\" I muttered.\r  \n\r  \nI looked at the elevator panel, only to find the lower portion of \"2\" and the upper portion of \"1\".\r  \n\r  \n\"What in the world?\"\r  \n\r  \nRealizing that the doors hadn't opened, I pressed the buttons and attempted to force them apart, but to no avail. Of all the times, it had to be today. I decided to call the security guard, Kashif, I picked up my phone, and at that moment, the elevator doors opened.\r  \n\r  \nBefore me lay a dark corridor, without a single light. Glancing back at the panel, I noticed that it still displayed the same numbers. I tapped the panel and pressed the buttons, but nothing happened.\r  \n\r  \nLetting out a sigh, I adjusted the strap of my bag and stepped out of the elevator. As soon as I did, the doors closed shut. I turned around, only to see the elevator panel indicating that it was descending to the ground level.\r  \n\r  \n\"You've got to be kidding me.\"\r  \n\r  \nI found myself in an unfamiliar corridor. It didn't match any floor layout I was familiar with. With my phone's flashlight activated, I cautiously proceeded forward, noticing a partially open door a few meters away. In a final desperate attempt, I pushed the elevator button, but it remained fixed on the ground level. Admitting defeat, I slowly approached the door.\r  \n\r  \nCarefully, I pushed the door open, my body on high alert for reasons I couldn't quite understand. Illuminating the room with my phone's light, I discovered empty workstations and chairs. I scanned the area, moving the light from one corner to another. In all my four years at the company, I had never seen this room before. I searched for a light switch, however, there were none, and I realized there were no windows either. Odd.\r  \n\r  \nThe only sound that came in the room was the sound of rushing air from the ventilation system. As I approached the first workstation, I noticed the name \"Akhtar Ali\" taped to the desk, accompanied by a photo of a man in his late thirties, I assumed the man in was Akhtar. Strangely enough, I had never seen or met him in the office before. I directed my flashlight towards the adjacent desk, where the name 'Parveen Nabil' was written\u2014a name I had never heard in the office either.\r  \n\r  \nSomething felt off. I hurriedly passed by each table, each taped with a name tag and a picture of the person assigned to it. As I approached the end of the table, a particular name caught my attention. There was no mistaking it. Moving closer, I confirmed that 'Asjad Bashir' was written there, accompanied by a picture taken on his last day of work.\r  \n\r  \nI took a step back from the table, feeling uneasy at what I had just looked at. Did the office maintain some bizarre memorial for all the staff members who had left? It sounded absurd, but that's exactly what was before me.\r  \n\r  \nThere were two desks next to Asjad's. I moved towards it, making me shiver at what I saw. The desks had mine and Awais' names taped on. What's more shocking was that the picture of either of us was the ones we took a couple of hours ago, when everyone had left.\r  \n\r  \n\"What in the world is going on? This is madness,\" I muttered.\r  \n\r  \nI knew I had to leave. Something was severely wrong. At the far end of the room, there was another door. I approached it and cautiously opened it. Immediately, a horrendous, rotting smell invaded my nostrils, nearly causing me to throw up. Covering my nose, I took a step forward but tripped over something and stumbled to the floor. In the process, my phone was thrown a few feet away, its light illuminating the room. As I slowly rose, I noticed an arm lying next to my feet. Startled, I stood up, only to be confronted with a horrifying sight.\r  \n\r  \nThe floor was covered in dried blood, and several hooks with chains dangled from the ceiling. Lifeless bodies hung from those hooks, each with their mouths impaled on a hook. Limbs were strewn across the floor, as every body had been gruesomely dismembered.\r  \n\r  \nI began to hyperventilate. What in God's name was I witnessing? This was sheer madness. Trembling, I reached for my phone, and as I retrieved it, I recognized the first body\u2014the resemblance was unmistakable, it was Asjad Bashir. The corpse had decomposed slightly, but the face was still recognizable.\r  \n\r  \nThree rooms stood at the end of the room, one of which was illuminated. I hurriedly made my way toward it, peeking through the doors' small window. Inside, a huge, obese man stood, easily seven feet tall and weighing over 500 pounds. His body was covered in scars and stitches, with a prominent red scar across his bald head. Gripping a massive meat cleaver, he was busy dismembering a lifeless figure on a table before him. With each strike, limbs fell off, and blood sprayed in all directions. I couldn't see the face of the body from my position.\r  \n\r  \n\"Gotta love it when the little fishy walks right into my hands,\" he chuckled, his voice hoarse.\r  \n\r  \nShocked and terrified, I stepped away from the door, realizing I needed to escape this place.\r  \n\r  \nI heard movement in the room and quickly ducked into the next room. Just as I slightly closed the door behind me, the man emerged. Although I couldn't see what he was doing, I heard the sound of chains rattling and the piercing of flesh.\r  \n\r  \nFootsteps echoed again, and it seemed the man was leaving. The footsteps halted, followed by the man sniffing the air, chuckling with delight.\r  \n\r  \n\"Oh boy, oh boy, looks like another little fishy was wandering around here. I do love me some good hide and seek.\"\r  \n\r  \nWith that, it sounded like he exited the slaughter room and entered the memorial room. Gathering my courage, I left the room I had hidden in, refraining from using my phone's flashlight to avoid being spotted. I used the light coming from the butcher's room to navigate my way to the butcher's room.\r  \n\r  \nThe room was a blood-splattered chaos.  In the center stood a large table, with limbs on it from the previous victim. I frantically searched the room for a key, a button, anything that could help me escape.\r  \n\r  \nBut there was nothing. Overwhelmed with despair, I collapsed onto the floor.\r  \n\r  \n\"I don't want to die. I don't want to die.\"\r  \n\r  \nAll hope seemed lost. That monster was sure to return any minute and kill me. At that moment, I noticed a large finger hanging on a cleaver keychain from one of the walls. I got up and grabbed it.\r  \n\r  \nThen, I heard the door behind me creak open, and I felt a force pulling me upright.\r  \n\r  \n\"Well, well, the little fishy has strayed too far from the fishing net.\"\r  \n\r  \nI turned and saw one of the ugliest faces I had ever seen, grinning at me. I struggled to break free from his grip, but he was too strong.\r  \n\r  \n\"Oh, the little fishy is putting up a fight? I do love me some strong fish.\"\r  \n\r  \nHe flashed a toothy grin and threw me onto the table. Placing his enormous hand on my neck, he began to strangle me.\r  \n\r  \n\"Now, playtime is over, fishy. Please die for me and create the music of death.\"\r  \n\r  \nHe brought his face closer to mine, a sadistic smile spreading across his lips. I clawed at his hands, but his grip tightened. I gasped for air and that made the man laugh.\r  \n\r  \n\"Give me more music fish.\"\r  \n\r  \nSummoning my last ounce of strength, I clenched the cleaver keychain tightly and drove it into his eye with all my might.\r  \n\r  \nThe man howled in agony and stumbled back. Coughing and gasping for air, I scrambled to my feet. With one goal in mind to escape, I sprinted out of the room.\r  \n\r  \n\"You piece of shit! I'll skin you alive!\" roared the butcher.\r  \n\r  \nI took out my phone and illuminated my path with its light. Hastily finding the door to the memorial room, I entered it. The room was now a mess, with overturned tables. I didn't have much time to assess the full extent of the butcher's rampage. I exited the memorial room, rushed down the corridor, and reached the elevator.\r  \n\r  \nFrantically pressing the buttons, I received no response. \"Come on, come on!\"\r  \n\r  \nDespite multiple attempts, the elevator remained motionless. I heard a loud explosion behind me, signaling that the man had entered the memorial room. Ready to give up, I remembered the giant finger I had picked up. I decided to use it to press the elevator button, and to my relief, the elevator started moving up.\r  \n\r  \nThe elevator doors opened and with that, the memorial room doors as well. The light from the elevator shone in the corridor and I saw him running towards me.\r  \n\r  \n\"Get here, you little fish.\"\r  \n\r  \nHe raised his cleaver and hurled it towards me. I used the finger and pressed the ground level. The doors closed, stopping the cleaver from impaling me. \r  \n\r  \nThe elevator descended and stopped at the ground level.\r  \n\r  \nThe doors opened, revealing the reception area of the office, with the security guard Kashif sitting there. As he saw me, he quickly stood and approached.\r  \n\r  \n\"What happened to you? You're a complete mess, and what's with all the blood?\" he asked, bewildered.\r  \n\r  \n\"There... I... He...\" I struggled to form any words.\r  \n\r  \nWith that, I bolted out of the front door. I ran and ran, not even bothering to call a taxi. I needed to distance myself from that place and everything I had witnessed.\r  \n\r  \nI reached my house in no time as I didn't live too far from the office, I locked all the doors and hid in my room. I don't know how, but somehow I managed to fall asleep. The next morning, I attempted to call Awais, but received no response. I tried calling the security guard, Kashif, but his phone was powered off. Each number I attempted to call yielded the same result\u2014no connection.\r  \n\r  \nDuring all this confusion, I noticed a text message notification on my phone. It was from Awais, sent to me just after he left the office last night. The message read:\r  \n\r  \n\"Junaid, what the hell is going on in this office? Why the hell are there dead bodies being kept here?\"",

Be careful OP, if possible go into hiding and change your name etc and get as far away as possible from your old life and family and friends.

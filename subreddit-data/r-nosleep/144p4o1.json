    "postText": "Last night I fled my house where my wife and mother had been possessed by some evil thing taking the shape of my childhood dog, Shadow. \n\nAfter driving, stricken by terror, aimless and without hope, I reached out to my sister, Ellie. We\u2019d never really been close, but I knew she\u2019d gone no contact with the rest of the family years ago, so if I had any safe haven it was going to have to be her. \n\n\u201cI was wondering if I\u2019d hear from you. Mom\u2019s been blowing up my phone, left me at least a dozen messages in the last couple hours, and she knows I\u2019m not about to listen to them.\u201d\n\nHonestly, I wasn\u2019t sure where to start, \u201cYou know that dog we had, Shadow, who disappeared thirty years ago? He showed back up at my house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, a dog? We never had a dog,\u201d she said. \n\nI described Shadow to her, told her about how he used to go everywhere with us, showed her pictures on my phone. Nothing jogged her memory. She literally had no memory whatsoever of us ever having a dog, nor of my mom pining after our lost pet for years afterward. I worried, was this Shadow\u2019s fault too? I\u2019d already witnessed firsthand his ability to reach into my mind, would it be too much to assume he could erase someone\u2019s memory of him entirely? \n\n\u201cYou have to be kidding. Why don\u2019t I remember him?\u201d she asked. \n\nI recounted what had happened in the two days since Shadow showed up, how strange my wife and our mother had been acting, Shadow\u2019s obsession with my son, my general feeling of the house being unsafe, how our mother chased me out of the house with scissors while I was holding my infant son. I left out the supernatural for now. How could I expect her to believe that? \n\n\u201cMom\u2019s finally lost it, huh? You know the thing that really drove us apart was how vicous she could get while mocking my beliefs in the spiritual. Now she goes and turns into a true believer because of this dog? It\u2019s hard to wrap my head around.\u201d \n\nWhile she listened to mom\u2019s ranting voicemails I got settled in and set up a makeshift travel crib for my son. He slept in the car but when he woke up he was obviously cranky about it. \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s really something else about this dog, isnt\u2019t she? She keeps saying you\u2019d better return his son and that you can get your own. I get why you had to escape.\u201d \n\nShe made me a coffee and I braved the walls of text my wife sent. \n\n\u201cCome back here honey. There\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. I keep telling you Shadow is a good dog, if you feel like he was hostile to you, he was only trying to protect our son. If you don\u2019t come home soon I\u2019m calling the police. You can\u2019t just take our son away from us. Shadow wouldn\u2019t like that. He\u2019s a good dog. Come back and he\u2019ll forgive you. WTH IS HAPPENING DON\u2019T COME HOME TAKE OUR SON FAR AWAY FROM HERE I\u2019M SO SCARED PLEASE HELP ME HELP ME I CAN\u2019T DO THIS HE\u2019S GOING TO KILL US HE\u2019S GOING TO KILL US ALL THERE\u2019S A BLACK PIT WITH TEETH AT IT\u2019S RIM AND IT\u2019S SWALLOWING ME IT\u2019S A BLACK PIT WITH BLOOD DRIPPING DOWN ITS SIDES I\u2019M SO SCARED I\u2019D RATHER DIE THAN LET HIM GET OUR SON I\u2019M SO SCARED THERE\u2019S A DEEP BLACK PIT WITH TEETH AT IT\u2019S RIM AND IT GOES DOWN AND DOWN AND IT NEVER ENDS THAT\u2019S WHERE I\u2019M GOING HE\u2019S NOT A DOG I\u2019M SO SORRY I\u2019M SO SORRY FOR EVERYTHING PLEASE HELP I CAN\u2019T DO THIS ANYMORE. Come back here honey. Shadow will forgive you. He\u2019s forgiven all of us. Can\u2019t you see that\u2019s why he\u2019s here? He wants to make our lives better. He\u2019s going to make sure our son is safe. Nobody will ever hurt him.\u201d\n\nI had to help her. My wife. Trapped in some deep supernatural pit. I couldn't imagine her terror. My face went slack sitting there at my sister's house, reading the messages, my child fussing in the corner. \n\n\"Does mom want to marry that dog or something? Seriously this is bonkers,\" my sister said from the kitchen. \"Hey, you still there?\" \n\nI was too caught in the dread of that wall of texts to respond. I felt like my soul had just been sucked out. I couldn't let her stay there. I couldn't let Shadow win this time. \n\n\"Yeah, I'm here. There's more than I told you.\" And so I told the story of exactly what had happened, how Shadow wasn't a dog but something else entirely, how he'd tried to take control of my mind. I showed her the texts from my wife. \n\nInitially, I was sure she'd think I'd lost it too. She had to remember that I was the imaginative child, of course she'd think that I was making up another story to deal with the trauma of leaving my family. \n\nBut to her credit she just nodded, listening. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of things like this happening, but never so serious,\u201d she said, the lines in her face deepening. I guess since we\u2019ve been so distant, I\u2019d never realized how much she\u2019d grown as a person, how she had her own complete life that had changed her. That carefree, curious, and impulsive red-headed older sister of mine had grown up years ago, and I wondered what she saw in me \u2014 her petulant younger brother \u2014 did she read the life behind my wrinkles as well?\n\n\u201cI have some friends who might be able to help,\u201d she said, hesitating. \u201cOnly, they\u2019re odd. So just, be real with them, okay? They might seem a bit eccentric, but they\u2019ll take this seriously. I promise. Dabbling with the occult takes a certain kind of person is all.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how I met Hawthorne and Taryn the next day. They came to my sister\u2019s house the next morning. Hawthorne was a short, goth looking guy who wore all sorts of chains with symbols on them. Pensive and quiet, he described himself as a warlock of sorts. Taryn was dressed like a construction worker with Carhartt Overalls and a white shirt. Her every gesture emanated a strange intensity that made me think of a drill sergeant. \n\n\u201cDamn. Complicated case huh?\u201d Hawthorne said, mostly to Taryn. \n\n\u201cComplicated? Nah, we take out the dog and whatever the hell this is will go about it\u2019s merry way, won\u2019t it?,\u201d she opened and closed her hands, tensing every muscle. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not so sure,\u201d Hawthorn turned the idea around in his head, \u201cif it\u2019s a standard demon maybe an exorcism. But this is some pretty nasty mind control for a demon, and why wouldn\u2019t it take a human as a host?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, we chop the head of the animal, it goes away?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doubtful on that. So far we\u2019ve seen evidence for three different manifestations of whatever this \u201cShadow,\u201d is, so it\u2019s difficult to ascertain which is the truth, or what lies behind all of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Hawthorne said. \u201cFirst is Shadow as the dog you\u2019d always known him as. Second is the version of Shadow that you saw standing at your son\u2019s crib. Third is this hole with the teeth lining its edges your wife detailed. That last part is the real riddle, because that\u2019s what she\u2019s seeing when she\u2019s inside its grasp trying to break free.\u201d \n\n\u201cSo what do we do?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is wait. This thing is a malicious entity and it\u2019s hungry for something. Showing up after thirty years, now exerting a great deal more influence, that\u2019s a major move. If Shadow can\u2019t get to your child he\u2019s going to escalate the situation.\u201d \n\n\u201cTombstone?\u201d Taryn asked. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d Hawthorne shrugged.\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cLike Wyatt Earp and his brothers against the cowboys, we go in armed to the hip and tell him to throw down his weapons and disband, get out of town, that sort of thing.\u201d Taryn almost seemed excited about it. \n\nI thought of my wife stuck in some deep pit, screaming for help. I hoped this worked. \n\nWe arrived at my house an hour before sunset. \n\nTaryn and Hawthorne had packed a full carload of supplies for the exorcism: holy water, crosses, bibles, holy books from other religions, a tub of salt, and a bunch of paraphernalia I couldn\u2019t identify. I\u2019d left my son in the care of my sister. If anything happened to me she said she would keep him safe. \n\nThe house looked so peaceful. Its blue trim gave way to white siding, the grass on the lawn only slightly untidy. Until today I\u2019d never walked in with an ounce of fear, but today it took an unbelievable effort just to open the car door. And yet, from the outside nobody could guess that something sinister waited within. \n\nMy mother was sitting at the kitchen table when we came in. \n\n\u201cGood, you\u2019ve brought friends. Shadow is very social. He\u2019ll be pleased for the company,\u201d she said. \n\nWe ignored her and went upstairs to find my wife and Shadow. \n\nThey were both sitting in my son\u2019s room as if they were waiting for us. \n\n\u201cShadow wants his son back, honey. Why don\u2019t you just bring him to us?\u201d my wife said in an eerie monotone. It sent a chill down my spine. That was her mouth, that was her voice box, but it wasn\u2019t quite her voice. \n\nShadow didn\u2019t move from where he sat, but gazed at Hawthorne and Taryn as if investigating every aspect of their appearance. \n\n\u201cNone of that will help you, but you\u2019re free to try. He won't stop you.\u201d my wife said, laughing. \n\nHawthorne and Taryn stood there, motionless. \n\n\"Start the exorcism, while we have the chance!\" I said. \n\nMy wife continued laughing. \"Oh I think Shadow might have changed his mind.\" She turned to me, \"Now you're going to push me down the stairs, as a little punishment.\"\n\nI looked at her in horror. \"No, not again,\" I said. \n\n\"Then maybe Shadow will kill your new friends here. How do you think he'll do it? Do you think it'll be quick? He could go for their throats. Or maybe he'll take his time? There's plenty of little arteries in the arms and legs he could bite into.\" \n\n\"I won't do it. We're going to stop you,\" I said. \n\nShe walked to the top of the stairs. \u201cCome on. It\u2019ll be fun. You can\u2019t tell me everything has always been rosy for us. This is your chance to get back at me.\u201d She paused. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun. I guess I\u2019ll just throw myself. Who knows, maybe my neck will snap. Shadow would have fun with that. Dogs like a good bone.\u201d \n\nI reached out and grabbed her, pulling her back right as she was about to do it. \n\n\u201cHELP HELP HE HAS MY MIND AND I CAN\u2019T GET OUT HELP ME I CAN\u2019T STAND IT ANYMORE!\u201d she screamed. \n\n\u201cWe have to go now!\u201d I said. \n\nI started pulling her toward the door and her head flew back and she began laughing in a voice that wasn\u2019t her own at all. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be that easy. Here\u2019s a deal: bring the child and you can have your wife back. In the meanwhile, I\u2019ll savor your friends.\u201d\n\nI turned to look at Hawthorne and Taryn. Shadow still had full control over them. What could I do? I couldn\u2019t leave them. \n\nJust then the glass jar of holy water in Taryn\u2019s hand shattered and she snapped out of paralysis. \u201cRun!\u201d she yelled, dragging Hawthorne. I tried to grab my wife, but she continued laughing, unmoving as if her body weighed as much as the whole house. \n\n\u201cPlease, please you have to break free from him. For one moment. I can\u2019t do this without you,\u201d I said. \n\nTaryn grabbed my hand and she must have dragged me out, because I wasn\u2019t going to abandon my wife to that monster again. Our son would be safe. It was her turn to be saved. \n\nI don\u2019t remember everything that happened in the next few minutes. I felt like a slab of rock. Somehow Hawthorne and Taryn got me out of the house and in the car and we drove back in the direction of my sister\u2019s house. \n\nWhat do I do now? \n\n[Part 1] https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/140pc2r/my_childhood_dog_just_showed_up_at_my_house_after/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\n\n[Part 2] https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/142ze2g/my_childhood_dog_showed_back_up_to_my_house_after/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3",

I would wear a cross necklace that has been blessed by a pastor or priest. And bring with you personally a sage stick, holy water, and a bible that has been blessed. All sacred items you bring with you need to be blessed before bringing them into that house.. Then find a special exorcist who specializes in these kinds of demonic possessions and have them try to cast this demon out. DO NOT TRY TO DO THIS YOURSELF; please seek an exorcist.\n\ngood luck. Um don\u2019t die.. or should i say turn into a \u201cshadow\u201d (ghosts are often referred to as shadows &amp; the dogs name is shadow.. its funny.. just laugh so i feel like i succeeded)",

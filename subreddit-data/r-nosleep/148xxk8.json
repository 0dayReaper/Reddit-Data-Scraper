    "postText": "[I took the day off work. I\u2019d barely slept\u2014I kept thinking she was going to come back.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/146m2ef/23andme_says_i_have_a_second_mother_part_2/) When I finally got up for the day, though, I realized the situation was probably a lot less creepy than I thought. She wasn\u2019t some long-lost relative or Rumplestiltskin baby stealer. She was under the influence of drugs, or suffering from mental illness.\n\nThose were the only explanations.\n\nOf course, that didn\u2019t explain the DNA results. Or how she knew I was pregnant. But I forced all those nagging questions out of my head and tried to move forward. By the afternoon, I was feeling much better about the whole thing.\n\nThen the bleeding began.\n\nAnd my entire world came to a stop.\n\nI began to sob. *No, no, no. I can\u2019t lose the baby. I can\u2019t.* My mom had told me once about the miscarriage she\u2019d had, before my brothers and I were born. How it had nearly destroyed her. I thought I\u2019d understood how horrible that was for her; but now, as I sat there staring at the smear of blood on toilet paper, I knew I hadn\u2019t *really* understood. Until now.\n\nI called Danny. He left work immediately. We called the doctor, and they told me to go on bedrest. But deep down, I knew it wouldn\u2019t help.\n\n*They won\u2019t be able to save your baby.*\n\nShe knew. She knew I was pregnant. She knew my baby was going to be lost forever.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t just some crazy woman. She *knew.*\n\nThe shrill ring of my phone snapped me out of my daze. I grabbed it\u2014and my heart leapt as I saw the name on the screen. \u201cMom,\u201d I cried. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to call you all day.\u201d Before she could say much else, I told her everything. The pregnancy. G visiting in the middle of the night, trying to break in. And the impending miscarriage...\n\n\u201cKayla\u2026\u201d she started\u2014and there was something about her voice that made my heart drop. \u201cYou need to find her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much I haven\u2019t told you.\u201d Her voice shook as she spoke. \u201cHer name\u2026 is Grezel. She came to me when I was eight weeks pregnant with you. The doctors were having trouble finding your heartbeat, and I thought I was going to have another miscarriage.\n\n\u201cShe offered me a deal. She would be able to save you, but in return\u2026 you would carry some of her DNA. I don\u2019t know how she did it. I don\u2019t know why. I just knew that I was scared, and desperate, and willing to do anything to save you. Even if it sounded completely crazy.\n\n\u201cI met her in the woods. We did this sort of\u2026 I don\u2019t even know. A blood ritual? That\u2019s the best way I can describe it. I don\u2019t believe in witchcraft or anything like that, but whatever she did, it *worked.* A few days later, when I went to my appointment, you were fine.\u201d\n\nI waited for her to say more, but she didn\u2019t. I was frozen, with the phone up to my ear, heart racing in my chest.\n\n\u201cWait.\u201d The gears spinning in my head finally caught. \u201cBut she has to be related to you. The DNA test said I\u2019m fifty percent you, and dad, *and* her. So there\u2019s got to be overlap.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that,\u201d she said. \u201cI just know that she\u2019ll save the baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 I have no way of contacting her. What if she doesn\u2019t come back?\u201d\n\nA pause. Then: \u201cShe\u2019ll come back.\u201d\n\nAfter the call, I just sat there. Staring at the wall. Trying to process everything she told me. Why did Grezel share DNA with my mom? Did she somehow\u2026 steal it\u2026 during the blood ritual? Maybe she was some sort of inhuman creature, that needed to suck DNA off everyone else. Maybe that was the trade.\n\nThis was starting to sound like some twisted fairy tale. One of the uncensored ones, where everyone dies horribly.\n\nMy mom was right. A few hours later, I was interrupted from my thoughts with a loud *thump! thump! thump!* on the front door.\n\nI ran down the stairs as fast as I could. But when I swung the door open, Grezel wasn\u2019t standing there. Instead, there was another piece of pink paper. Scribbled in black marker were the words:\n\n**meet me in the woods behind the r--- mall at midnight. come alone.**\n\n**-G**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe forest was dark. I heard the chittering of bats overhead, somewhere, as they swept through the air for their nightly meal. The leaves crunched under my feet as I continued further in.\n\nJust as I was starting to lose hope, I saw her.\n\nA dark silhouette, standing in a small clearing off to my right. Wearing a long, black gown that draped so effortlessly over her body it looked like it was made of shadow. Her dark hair, streaked with silver, cascaded down her back.\n\n\u201cGrezel,\u201d I called out.\n\nShe turned around. Her skin was so pale in the moonlight, it looked like it almost glowed. \u201cI see you\u2019ve decided to join me.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you save the baby?\u201d\n\nHer lips twisted into a crooked smile. \u201cYes,\u201d she crooned. \u201cCome closer.\u201d\n\nI slowly stepped towards her, my heart hammering in my chest. Up close, I realized she appeared older than I thought she was. Deep wrinkles cut her face, crinkling around her eyes. And her eyes\u2026 there was something off about them. Her irises were pure black\u2014and they were too large, giving them an almost bug-like appearance.\n\n\u201cAre you ready to begin?\u201d\n\nI nodded.\n\nShe pulled a knife from the folds of her dress. The silver blade glinted in the moonlight. She smiled at me, crookedly, and drew it along her palm.\n\nThen she grabbed my right hand. Turned it over. I let out a soft cry of pain as she dug the blade into my skin. Dark blood bloomed out of the wound, glinting in the moonlight.\n\nThen she pressed her palm against mine.\n\nA tingle of pain shot up my arm. I could feel it, feel *something*, traveling up my veins and deeper into my body. Then it dissipated, and we were standing there together, staring at each other in the darkness.\n\n\u201cYour child will live,\u201d she whispered.\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019ll be okay? You\u2019re not going to take them from me, or\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDid I take you from your mother?\u201d\n\nI shook my head.\n\nShe turned around, her black dress swirling around her. \u201cWe are done here.\u201d\n\nBut something didn\u2019t sit right with me. It was\u2026 too easy. What did Grezel get out of all this? My DNA? Why would she want to save my baby? Just to genetically be their mother? Not to steal them or raise them as her own?\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d I called out. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be something you\u2019re getting out of this.\u201d\n\nShe turned back towards me, her wild dark hair falling in front of her face.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the catch? Tell me. I don\u2019t want to spend my whole life dreading it.\u201d\n\nShe paused, her smile growing wider.\n\nAnd then she spoke.\n\n\u201cYour children will carry my DNA. So will your brother\u2019s children. And so will your grandchildren, and your great-grandchildren, and your great-great-grandchildren. My DNA will lay dormant in them, spreading silently, generation by generation.\u201d Her smile grew wider. \u201cThen, one day\u2014when I am ready\u2014my soldiers will come out of dormancy. And we will reclaim the forests and rivers, the earth that you destroyed. The earth that belongs to the fae.\u201d\n\nThen she turned on her heel and walked deeper into the forest, until the shadows swallowed her [up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)",

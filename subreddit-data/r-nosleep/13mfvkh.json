    "postText": "It was the 12th of April, 2013. I was working at a local branch of a national TV news organization. We were probably the third largest newsroom in West Virginia at the time. I was mainly working as a news writer, but I helped with assignment editing for our reporters whenever we had something big come up.\n\nI got called up just after midnight. All hands on deck. Just from the way they talked to us, and the urgency in their voices, I thought we were looking at another 9/11. I was fully expecting something vast and catastrophic.\n\nWhen I got to the station, I didn\u2019t know what to believe. The parking lot was packed, but I didn\u2019t see anything resembling police or FBI vehicles.  I did recognize the symbols from both the USACE (United States Army Corps of Engineers) and EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) though. At this point, I thought we were looking at a natural disaster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was ushered inside by a strange man in rough denim jeans, a flannel shirt, and some kind of Bluetooth headset. He was clearly supposed to look like a civilian, but everything about his demeanor screamed \u201cmilitary\u201d. The determined eyes, the no-questions-asked kind of demeanor. There was no point in questioning him; these people were brick walls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe newsroom looked different in the dark. Everything does. The shadows were longer, and everything had a slight echo to it. Maybe the sounds just weren\u2019t soaked up as quickly by the background noise.\n\nThere weren\u2019t enough chairs for everyone, so some people were sitting on the floor. I was in the back, leaning against the wall next to my fellow news writers; Ben and Erika. Last names withheld. We were all a bit worked up and anxious, but Erika couldn\u2019t turn herself off; she was always working, and always making mental notes.\n\n\u201cNot everyone\u2019s here,\u201d she whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re missing people,\u201d she repeated. \u201cWe\u2019re missing a live camera crew.\u201d\n\nShe was right. Peter usually did live camera coverage. He worked closely with Noelle, who was also nowhere to be seen. Literally everyone but those two were there. Noelle usually did night and early morning coverage, so I expected her to be front and center.\n\n\u201cThey, uh, they were working up in, uh, Juniper,\u201d Ben added. \u201cGot a call from a local.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething happened up there?\u201d I asked. \u201cWildfire?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, nothing like that, no,\u201d Ben shook his head. \u201cNo idea what though. Something down in the valley.\u201d\n\nErika shrugged. We\u2019d never seen anything like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA woman in a pantsuit walked in and two men stepped up to block the exit. We\u2019d never seen any of these people before. We usually used this room for morning briefings, but without the murmur of people sipping their morning coffee the room seemed more sinister. The pantsuit woman held several folders and kept talking to someone over her earpiece. Out of all people in the room, she seemed to be the one with the most answers.\n\nAs to demand our attention, she slammed the folders down on the front desk \u2013 hard. The room fell silent.\n\n\u201cThere is a situation developing in Greenbrier Valley,\u201d the woman in the pantsuit said. \u201cThere has been a small earthquake. There are no casualties. In many ways, this is an insignificant event in and of itself. How your news team even heard about it is\u2026 beyond our comprehension.\u201d\n\nErika gave me a knowing smile. People around the valley loved Noelle and her early morning segments. She had the most recurrent viewers, by a large margin. If something happened around the valley, she\u2019d know about it.\n\n\u201cSince this is a matter of national interest, we\u2019ve had to clamp down to control the spread of information,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to cause any unnecessary grievances.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s such a small deal, why go to all this trouble?\u201d\n\nOne of our editors, Charlie. She never knew when to stay quiet. The woman in the pantsuit stopped, considered the question, and took a deep breath. I could tell she was stressed.\n\n\u201cIt is a developing situation. It might have some impact on the local wildlife, hence the presence of our friends at the USACE and the EPA.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what organization are you representing?\u201d\n\nCharlie just couldn\u2019t stop herself from asking questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe woman in the pantsuit might\u2019ve tolerated a single interruption, but not two. One of the armed men covering the door walked up to Charlie, grabbed her by the arm, and lifted her to her feet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just asking who you\u2019re working with,\u201d Charlie scoffed. \u201cIs that a problem? Is there a problem telling me who we\u2019re working with?\u201d\n\nShe refused to budge. The man tried to pull her away, but she twisted herself loose and stepped back. There was a murmur as we could see things escalate from frustration to potential confrontation.\n\n\u201cJust tell us!\u201d Charlie continued. \u201cAre you with DNR? NOAA? Why aren\u2019t you answering my question?\u201d\n\nThe man with the flannel shirt caught up with her, and she put her hands up. With no resistance, and no provocation, he pushed her down on one of the tables; face first. He pushed his elbow into her neck, causing her to heave and cough like she was being strangled. He put her in zip ties in a matter of seconds and dragged her out in a show of force.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow everyone was off the floor. The crew tried to talk over one another in this storm of complaints and questions. One of the camera operators tried to get out, and had a gun pulled on him. Things were escalating fast, and it only stopped when the woman in the pantsuit slammed down her folders again. For a split second, I thought it was a gunshot.\n\n\u201cIf we start working together, y\u2019all might just have a career left by the end of the night. Since cooperation doesn\u2019t seem to be a given at this point, we must take some precautions.\u201d\n\nThey took our phones away and patted us down to make sure we didn\u2019t have anything hidden. The woman in the pantsuit laid out a bunch of documents for us to sign. We didn\u2019t get the time to read them; just a pen to sign them with and a promise of pain if we refused.\n\nOnce it was said and done, she left. I never saw her again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the next hour, they brought in more people. Two more cars of armed guards dressed in civilian outfits. Once they took us out of the meeting room, we were divided into three different teams. Marcus, our news director, was completely sidelined. Quarantined, sort of.\n\nThere was no clear organizational structure; it was all ordered remotely. We could hear the various agents receive instructions from an offsite central command. Something down in Greenbrier Valley, we suspected.\n\nA man arrived just past two in the morning. He was in his early seventies and dressed in a cheap navy-blue suit, but I could tell he was the one to keep my eyes on. The other agents seemed to pay special attention to him. He had this goofy little sunflower pin on his collar. Something old and corporate. We were dragged back into the meeting room as the guards started handing out folders.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWe got three possible developments,\u201d the old man said. \u201cAll equally possible, and we need to be prepared for each of them. There will be more people coming in through the night, and you\u2019ll be expected to stay here for the next 16 hours, minimum.\u201d\n\nThere were no questions. We hadn\u2019t seen Charlie since she was carried off. They\u2019d talked to Marcus about it, and ever since, he\u2019d been quiet. This was a man who was usually standing at the front of the room barking orders and taking charge. Now he looked like a beaten puppy.\n\n\u201cThose of you with green folders are to stay right here,\u201d the old man continued. \u201cBlue folders need to go with the gentleman by the door. Red folders, you\u2019re coming with me.\u201d\n\nAll news writers got differently colored folders. I got a red folder. It was ominous, to say the least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were taken into one of the back rooms, along with an armed contingency. There was a seal on the folder, and I didn\u2019t want to take a chance on breaking it. A reporter, a video editor, an assignment editor, three people from the production crew, and one of the anchors. I can\u2019t tell you the name, but you\u2019d recognize him if you lived in WV in the 2010\u2019s.\n\nWe all sat down around a small table. The old man followed us there, reminding us about the NDA we\u2019d been forced to sign. Once we were all behind closed doors, he had the guards wait for him outside. For a moment, it was just the old man, and us.\n\n\u201cI need your absolute discretion on this topic,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can read your briefing.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe broke the seals and went through our folders. Page after page of details, pictures, graphs and statistics. Mine was about diamondback rattlesnakes. How there was an aggressive and invasive brood, and how people were supposed to stay away from the lakes near Greenbrier Valley because of them. Something about an urgent call for people to stay out of various underground caves, and to not be alarmed by the presence of \u201cwildlife specialists\u201d in the area.\n\nIt all seemed hastily prepared. One of the editors raised his hand, and the old man allowed him to speak.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d said the editor. \u201cYou, uh\u2026 you know there are no diamondbacks like that around here, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019re gonna have to report it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I mean\u2026 this is a lie. It is fiction. These are native to, like\u2026 Georgia?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter what it is, and what it isn\u2019t. You\u2019re reporting it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m telling you - people will notice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll believe whatever we goddamn tell them to believe!\u201d\n\nThe old man slammed his hand down; hard. We all recoiled as one of the guards opened the door. He was waved aside, and the door promptly closed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs tempers cooled, the old man stepped outside to have a smoke. The rest of us were left to discuss on our own for a while. We compared notes, and we weren\u2019t thrilled about the implications.\n\nThis was clearly a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d kind of folder. And while the whole story about enraged rattlesnakes were fiction, it still highlighted something. If this scenario took place, there\u2019d be armed guards surrounding a massive area. They spoke of a possible controlled burning of the undergrowth and closing several large roads. About three dozen homes would have to be evacuated, minimum.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t even about what they were saying; it was about what they weren\u2019t saying. This was clearly not about rattlesnakes, so what the hell were they afraid of? Whatever it was, it was bad enough for them to threaten to burn down several acres of forest in the Lewisburg area.\n\nThen, I saw the eyes of our news anchor go wild.\n\n\u201cThere are time stamps,\u201d he said. \u201cThis one is in\u2026 four hours.\u201d\n\nTo put that whole plan into action, with such short notice, they had to already have put things into motion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen the old man returned, we were again separated and told to start working on the news segment. I was to write it up and summarize it, using the provided information and quotes to make it cohesive. There were some pictures and videos handed to our video editor. Our news anchor was told to perform a mock interview with a supposed \u201csnake expert\u201d who could explain the situation. It was actually just one of the guards, sitting in the adjacent room with a walkie-talkie.\n\nWe were gonna pre-record it all so that the segment could be played if a sudden evacuation was necessary. I found it strange, considering our station was nowhere near the area that officially needed to be evacuated, according to their own fictional scenario. There was something else brewing.\n\nI managed to catch a glimpse of Erika, and we exchanged a look across the hall. I asked one of the armed guards if I could use the restroom. He didn\u2019t seem to mind but told me he\u2019d check on me in a few minutes. I excused myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met Erika in the bathroom. I could tell she was flustered.  She kept washing her hands, as if trying to keep herself occupied.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019d you get?\u201d I whispered. \u201cWhat\u2019d they tell you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say they\u2019re hunting an escaped convict. Armed and dangerous. You?\u201d\n\n\u201cRattlesnakes. Diamondback rattlesnakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I nodded. \u201cRattlesnakes.\u201d\n\nWe compared notes. The stories provided were completely different, but they had something in common; evacuation of an area, and the presence of armed guards. Both could also be a future explanation for possible civilian injuries.\n\nWhat changed was the scale. Erika\u2019s story was much smaller in scope, and somewhat more believable. Mine would have the same effect, but to a much larger area. Also, her story didn\u2019t involve setting fire to parts of the valley. It did mention locking doors though, and not picking up hitchhikers.\n\nErika was dumbfounded. She walked back and forth, scratching her head.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is this? What aren\u2019t they telling us?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not the time to ask questions. We gotta stay low on this.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is fucking bullshit,\u201d she wheezed. \u201cWhat the fuck are we gonna lie about next? Bigfoot? The chupacabra? The red piper birds that trick kids into the woods?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t fucking know, but it doesn\u2019t matter. We can\u2019t do shit right now.\u201d\n\nErika didn\u2019t like it, but she knew I was right. And to be fair, that red piper bird story has some merit to it. I know a guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur time was up, and we were moved to different rooms. I was plopped down in front of a laptop with a guard supervising my actions. They\u2019d pulled our wi-fi, but I started sketching up a segment about the supposed \u2018diamondback outbreak\u2019. Every paragraph was reviewed, and there was no revision. Everything was immediately sent to the studio, or sent back with a list of notes.\n\nThere were protests from the crew, but they were quickly silenced. The video editors had little to nothing to work with, and without Noelle and Peter, we knew people would start to ask questions. You can\u2019t just have an early morning segment without them, about something so outlandish. Not only were we lying; we were forced to do it badly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a precaution,\u201d we were told. \u201cThat\u2019s all there\u2019s to it. A precaution. It probably won\u2019t air.\u201d\n\nPeople were running all over the place. Some of them screaming at each other in the corridors. Someone was crying in the bathroom, and a guy from the production crew passed out from the stress. He looked like a ventriloquist dummy, sitting with his eyes half-open as he slumped over in the corner. One of our assistants were trying to explain something to a guard and got a right hook straight to the jaw in response. Things were getting out of hand, quickly, and I was under intense pressure to finish my writing.\n\nAt one point, we were all pulled out of our chairs and pushed up against the wall. When people started protesting, we were all told to be quiet. And for a few minutes, you could hear a pin drop. And somewhere in the distance; a helicopter.\n\nThe guards started buzzing about. They talked about preparing for something. They brought out a kind of plastic paneling and duct tape from one of their trucks and forced one of the writing teams out of a meeting room on the bottom floor.\n\nThe helicopter was coming our way. I heard screams about \u201cemergency landing\u201d as people scrambled to prepare something downstairs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could see a little from a window on the top floor. I couldn\u2019t see where the helicopter landed, but the sound it made was deafening. Even from inside the building, I had to cover my ears. I could see camouflaged soldiers bringing someone inside; someone screaming at the top of their lungs. A woman, I think.\n\n\u201cBoil water!\u201d someone screamed. \u201cWe need to boil water!\u201d\n\n\u201cTowels! We need more towels!\u201d yelled another.\n\nThere was intense debate. Even now, the news anchor was told to keep recording. The old man was debating something over his earpiece. I couldn\u2019t quite make it out, but I heard some colors mentioned; it seemed that the red folder would be the most likely outcome. Then at some point, it sounded like the red folder wouldn\u2019t be enough. They were already talking extensions and \u201cfurther contingencies\u201d.\n\nAt one point, while the initial parts of the segments were exported for review, the old man pulled me aside. I was taken downstairs, closer to the screaming, and put in a small side room.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna be honest with you, miss,\u201d he said as we shuffled down the stairs. \u201cWe might have to go off script on this one.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were no more physical folders to distribute, but they called this theoretical contingency the \u201cviolet\u201d folder. It was just me and Ben working on it, seeing as the first folder had been completely abandoned, and we needed a new solid concept. The \u201cmildest\u201d scenario was no longer plausible, it seemed. The old man sat us down and complained that we needed something to explain a whole new set of events.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking, maybe\u2026 six- or seven-miles increased radius in each direction. Complete water shutdown for all of Lewisburg for at least 36 hours. Semi-controlled fire at\u2026 at an unprecedented scale. Intermittent power outages. Waves of ground shocks that can cause\u2026 everything from traffic disruption to bursting gas and sewage pipes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t, uh\u2026 where do we start?\u201d asked Ben.\n\nThe old man threw up his arms in defeat. He looked ten years older.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 it has to make sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo just tell them the truth. Tell us the truth,\u201d I pleaded. \u201cWe can help.\u201d\n\nFor a moment, I could see he was considering it. He was nodding, looking down, and searched for the right words. Then something changed. He held a finger up to his earpiece, and his eyes shifted. Someone was talking. Suddenly, he shot out of his chair.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not bringing them here,\u201d he told someone on the other end of the line. \u201cWe have civilians, you can\u2019t- no!\u201c\n\nAnd with that, he ran out of the room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBen and I just sat there for a while. I tried to imagine what could be happening out there to cause this kind of response. I thought back on what the woman in the pantsuit had said; \u201cThis is a situation developing in the Greenbrier Valley\u201d. That\u2019s a huge area. Was it that she\u2019d just been unspecific, or was this something that really encompassed the entire valley?\n\nConsidering I was working on the \u201cviolet\u201d folder, I was starting to consider the latter.\n\n\u201cI, uh\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Ben admitted. \u201cThere\u2019s, like\u2026 nothing like this. That I\u2019ve worked on, I mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of us have,\u201d I added. \u201cWater, power, plumbing\u2026 did he say earthquakes?\u201d\n\n\u201cEarth shocks,\u201d nodded Ben. \u201cNot earthquakes, but like\u2026 a series of aftershocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do those come about? What the hell do we say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI, uh, I\u2019m not a, uh\u2026 I\u2019m not a geologist,\u201d Ben smiled. \u201cMaybe, uh\u2026 blame the democrats?\u201d\n\nI chuckled. Ben always knew exactly the best wrong thing to say.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe helicopter was leaving, but something was happening outside. People were going quiet in the hallways. From the safety of our little room, we could hear them bringing something in. Something being rolled on squeaky wheels. Ben was about to peek out, but I pulled him back. We weren\u2019t getting involved. Not on my watch\n\nThe screaming woman had gone quiet. Maybe she\u2019d passed out.\n\nI could hear something banging on metal. A gargle, followed by a snakelike hiss. Squeaking wheels kept turning as something was slowly being pushed through the building.\n\nThen another banging sound, followed by a snap. Everything fell deathly quiet.\n\nA second later \u2013 chaos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGunshots, screams, screeching metal. Wood breaking, glass shattering. Automatic gunfire, hundreds of rounds sprayed in all directions.\n\nAs the gunfire died down, I could hear people running; scrambling for safety. Doors being slammed shut with desperate voices calling out for barricades and ammunition.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019re still people out there!\u201d a muffled voice came through. \u201cGet them out of there!\u201d\n\nAnd then, a completely alien noise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe best way I can describe it is a rattled breath. The same kind of rattle you hear when a big wasp struggles against a glass window; but bigger, and organic. It was rhythmic, like someone taking deep, wounded breaths.\n\nThen, there was clicking. Sharp, dolphin-like clicking. It bounced against the walls, forcing an echo. It was such a sharp sound that it tickled my inner ear, making my head spin.\n\nI heard footsteps. Several pairs; multiple individuals.\n\nAnd they were coming our way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur room was just a little meeting room. A table with a set of laptops, five office chairs, two fake plants and a gray carpet; that was it. But I got the feeling that if whatever was out there made its way in here, we\u2019d be in trouble. This had to be the answer to whatever was happening down in the valley. And whatever it was, that sound was going to haunt my nightmares.\n\nI pointed at the light switch, but Ben didn\u2019t get the hint. I tried waving my hand around, and that seemed to do the trick. He snapped back to reality, killed the light, and we both crawled under the table.\n\nMoments later, something wet slapped against the door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBen covered his mouth to stifle a scream. I could still hear his whimper.\n\nAnother slap against the door, this one higher up. I could hear another set of footprints further off, counting at least three individuals in total.\n\nThen, creaking metal.\n\nThe handle was turning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBen couldn\u2019t shut up. He was on the cusp of hyperventilation, and it seemed to just be a matter of time.\n\n\u201cYou gotta stop, Ben,\u201d I whispered. \u201cYou gotta stop. Just stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cI-I\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t just\u2026no, I-I\u2026\u201d\n\nIt got worse. I put my hand over his mouth, forcing it shut. I could feel his hot breath on my fingers.\n\nThe door handle turned, as something wet slapped its way into the room; only slightly muffled by the carpet.\n\nMore clicking. More rattled exhales. Something viscous and warm dropping onto the floor in chunks.\n\nI could feel Ben\u2019s breathing growing more and more irregular. Faster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething slammed down on the table above us. Ben couldn\u2019t help it.\n\nHe *yelped*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a moment, everything was silent. Every room, every guard, every vehicle outside. I didn\u2019t even realize I was holding my breath until my face started feeling warm.\n\nThen, one of the office chairs was flung across the room.\n\nHissing. Angry, animalistic hissing. And suddenly, Ben shuddered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s standing on my foot,\u201d he breathed. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s stand\u2026 standing\u2026 on my-\u201c\n\nBen grabbed a hold of me. Clinging to me.\n\nAnd in the next breath, he was pulled out from under the table.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe wasn\u2019t even screaming anymore, just\u2026 wailing like a frightened child struggling to understand his lungs. I heard something heavy come down on him, over and over, like a primate trying to crush a watermelon. Temporary lapses in his breathing as his ribs were crushed. Something snapping as his arm was twisted out of its socket. Drops of something warm spattering, hitting me across the face and the right side of my arm.\n\nI could\u2019ve stayed. I could\u2019ve hoped that they\u2019d move on. And yet, something in the back of my mind was telling me to run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven in the dark, I knew this place by heart. I scrambled out from under the table, burst through the door, and headed straight for the exit.\n\nA dozen voices screamed at me from a dozen directions.\n\n\u201cGo go go! Come on!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis way!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look back!\u201d\n\n\u201cStay low! Stay low!\u201d\n\nSomething was panting, trying to catch up. Something wet. I could feel it brush against the back of my head, pulling away a handful of strands of hair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe front doors opened as the man in the flannel shirt pulled me out. Gunfire echoed as whatever\u2019d been behind me retreated into the dark.\n\nI only caught a glimpse of them. Slick, oil-black skin. Eyes like a shark; deep and unfeeling. Rows of syringe-like teeth. Roughly humanoid, but only by shape.\n\nSomeone yelled out that they got one. Emboldened, doors started to open. More gunfire, screams, and flashes of light.\n\nYet all I could concentrate on was the deep dark blood covering my hands; still dripping from my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that, things went fast.\n\nI was pulled out and examined. They went for the segment about the escaped convict, claiming at least one known victim.\n\nBen.\n\nThey kept the story small and local. If you lived in the area back in 2013 it is possible you might\u2019ve caught it on the morning and afternoon news on April 12th. A short mention of it on the 13th. We were under strict control, and they weren\u2019t kidding around when it came to threats. They made it very clear that a single word about this would not only jeopardize our career; but our very lives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s been 10 years. I\u2019ve changed a few locations, a few names, and a few details. But the gist of it is right there.\n\nMaybe they\u2019re still checking in on us from time to time to see if we\u2019re behaving. I don\u2019t think they are.\n\nI\u2019m making this as a sort of witness to what really happened that day. There was no escaped convict. No knife attacks. But people died that day, and I still haven\u2019t got the faintest clue as to why. And we can\u2019t even ask questions, or they\u2019ll make us pay.\n\nBut I won\u2019t forget. I can\u2019t.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd you\u2019ll never find me anywhere near West Virginia again.",

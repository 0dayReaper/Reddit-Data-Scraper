    "postText": "All of us texted it. My brother, Joon, his wife Mei, our cousins Clara and Phil and their partners, and me\u2014the only single among the couples at our backyard barbecue. I was turning the dogs on the grill when Joon brought it up, claiming to have overheard some of the tech bros at work discussing it:\n\n\u201cYou just text, \u2018What is my death date?\u2019 and it\u2019ll tell you when you\u2019re going to die\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way!\u201d gasped cousin Clara. \u201cYou\u2019re shitting me!\u201d\n\n\u201c*Creepy!*\u201d Mei rubbed her arms and shivered.\n\n\u201cBullshit!\u201d I called.\n\nJoon\u2019s been a champion bullshitter since we were little. When he met Mei (whose name I like to think is short for \u201cmayhem\u201d), the two hit it off like firecrackers, each trying to one-up the other with their shenanigans. Pranks that ran from the harmless\u2014like Mei making caramel onions instead of apples\u2014to the elaborate, like the week I found roaches all over my apartment, even falling on me from the showerhead. Joon sniffed out a receipt for plastic roaches on Mei\u2019s credit card, and convinced me to get her back with a *live* centipede, which I put in a cup and handed to her. Not until she screamed and flung the centipede back at me did Joon\u2019s maniacal cackling finally clue me in that he\u2019d played us both.\n\nSo, this death date business?\n\nYeah. Classic Joon bullshit.\n\nHe was showing off his phone screen\u2014his death date was tomorrow. In rapid succession, the others all texted the number, so I went ahead and joined (even though it was a stupid prank, and not even one of his better ones).\n\nWe compared responses:\n\n**ME:** *9:49pm May 15, 2023*\n\n**CLARA:** *11:16am June 5, 2040*\n\n**HOWIE:** *1:19pm March 11, 2027*\n\n**PHIL:** *6:44am October 3, 2063*\n\n**ISRA:** *7:53pm November 7, 2029*\n\n**MEI:** *9:45pm June 11, 2023*\n\n**JOON:** *10:53am May 12, 2023*\n\nTomorrow was Joon\u2019s\u2014coincidentally on his birthday. Mei and Clara were freaking out. They kept asking was he scared? Wasn\u2019t he worried? Phil jokingly suggested he should lock himself up indoors and make sure to not go out anywhere, etc.\n\nOf course Joon made a big production of it, texting updates all through the morning of his birthday. And then, after 10:53am\u2026. Nothing. Joon\u2019s texts just stopped.\n\nIt was, of course, all completely fucking staged.\n\nJust as cousin Clara dragged in our parents who then called *me* and insisted I go *check on my brother* and *honey we know it\u2019s just Joon being Joon but go make sure*\u2014he finally sent a video thanking everyone for the birthday wishes and exclaiming about how he\u2019d see us all soon to celebrate his *birth*, not his *death*, and also how he\u2019d gotten messages from Mom and Dad and *so many people* and how funny it spread so far, even his boss had called\u2014\n\nSometimes I wanted to strangle my little brother.\n\nSo anyway, we all agreed later at his birthday party that *no one* was fooled, and asked who were we actually texting? Turned out we\u2019d been texting Aisha, a girl he\u2019d met and was planning to set me up with (nice of him, though these kinds of dates rarely worked in my favor). So, I added the number to my contacts and then messaged her.\n\n**ME:** *Hey, death date girl. Aisha, right? So my little bro dragged you into one of his evil schemes?*\n\n**AISHA:** *9:49pm May 15, 2023*\n\n**ME:** *lol good one but he already came clean*\n\n**AISHA:** *9:49pm May 15, 2023*\n\nI frowned as I noticed something that I hadn\u2019t the first time around.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d I showed the group my phone. \u201cGuys, I don\u2019t think this is Aisha.\u201d\n\nGeneral scoffs all around. Because of course they thought I was kidding. But then I opened the contact so they could see the number. Turns out I\u2019d been one digit off this whole time. Everyone else had been messaging Aisha and getting made-up death dates from her. But I\u2019d messaged\u2026 someone else.\n\nWhen they realized this, the group sobered up.\n\n\u201cWell, well, well\u2026 who *did* you text, then?\u201d Joon snatched my phone, eyes bright with curiosity.\n\n\u201cI have no idea\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAsk them who they are,\u201d suggested cousin Clara.\n\nSo I did.\n\nAgain, the same response:\n\n*9:49pm May 15, 2023*\n\n\u201cOooh, lemme try!\u201d Mei tapped the mystery number into her phone and whizzed off a text, and almost immediately a bell chimed with a response: *12:33am May 15, 2023*\n\n\u201cOh my God you guys\u2026 chills!\u201d squealed Clara.\n\n\u201c*THAT* is creepy.\u201d Mei eyed Joon. \u201cThat\u2019s how you do a death date prank.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you set this up?\u201d Joon asked her.\n\n\u201cNo! I swear!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, that\u2019s enough death dates,\u201d declared our dad. He and Mom could only suffer so much of our antics.\n\nThe conversation was dropped. As I was heading back home later Joon approached me. He seemed annoyed, convinced either I or someone else was copying his idea, which he claimed wasn\u2019t funny since he\u2019d already done it. Apparently, he really wanted to know who was behind it. I told him I had no clue\u2014but just his asking set a cold pin of anxiety in my brain. After all, if it wasn\u2019t someone in our family group, whose number was that? Imagining some stranger texting back sent icy fingers tracing the flesh of my neck.\n\nJoon grumbled that it was probably Mei, then smiled and encouraged me to give Aisha a ring. \u201cTry to be cool,\u201d he said, \u201cand less of a stick in the mud.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the word you\u2019re looking for is \u2018responsible,\u2019\u201d I suggested. \u201c\u2018Serious.\u2019 \u2018Mature.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAll synonyms for \u2018boring\u2019!\u201d\n\nI flipped him the bird, and then I forgot about the whole \u201cdeath date\u201d thing for a few days. I didn\u2019t even remember it until today when I went to message Aisha and got that same response:\n\n**AISHA:** *9:49pm May 15, 2023.*\n\nShit, I\u2019d forgotten to delete the \u201cdeath date\u201d number from my contacts after putting her name in. I did so now. I was about to message the real Aisha when curiosity brought me back to the death date number again, now just coming up as \u201cunknown\u201d on my phone. I messaged:\n\n**ME:** *Who is this*\n\n**UNKNOWN:** *9:49pm May 15, 2023*\n\n**ME:** *Mei??*\n\n**UNKNOWN:** *9:49pm May 15, 2023*\n\nFuck it. I borrowed a coworker\u2019s phone, asking if I could send a quick text since mine was dead (a white lie\u2014sometimes I could be as sneaky as Joon), and I sent to the same number the original question again.\n\n**ME:** *When is my death date?*\n\n**UNKNOWN:** *9:49pm May 15, 2023*\n\nFu\u2026. The hairs on the back of my neck prickled.\n\nHow the hell had this number responded with the same exact date and time to a completely different phone?\n\nThe sudden icy grip of fear was impossible to ignore.\n\nI called Joon, but it went to voicemail. Moments later, my phone buzzed.\n\n**JOON:** *work*\n\n**JOON:** *?*\n\nI sent a rapid series of texts explaining.\n\n**JOON:** *one sec*\n\n**JOON:** \u2026\n\n**JOON:** *I got 9:42pm May 15, 2023*\n\n**JOON:** *prolly mei*\n\n**JOON:** *lol*\n\nA few hours later, Joon met me at my townhouse. He told me flatly that he couldn\u2019t figure out who owned the number\u2014and it struck me that, given he works at a tech company, he\u2019d probably tried all sorts of tricks to track it down. Annoying as he could be, he\u2019s incredibly smart. The fact he hadn\u2019t figured out where it came from made the knot in my gut tighten. A horrible dread settled over me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s just Mei. She\u2019s been out all day and hasn\u2019t been responding to any of my texts. Bet she set this whole thing up to freak us out.\u201d Joon spoke casually, rolling his eyes.\n\nHe didn\u2019t like to admit when something got under his skin, *ever*. But having grown up with him, I could spot it in the tension around his eyes, the way his smile didn\u2019t reach them.\n\nI called Mei\u2019s phone.\n\nStraight to voicemail.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s at a show with Clara and her mom,\u201d Joon said. \u201cBeen going on about it all week\u2026 no coincidence the show ends just a half hour before our death date. Give her enough time to rush over here to scare us. It\u2019s part of this whole thing. Trust me, she\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d And then he grinned, pointing at my laptop. \u201cYou\u2019re typing this all up?\u201d\n\nI started typing earlier this afternoon. Documenting, in case\u2026 well, just in case.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great! Ooh, I know some people you can send it to\u2014you know, make it viral!\u201d\n\n\u201cZero interest,\u201d I said.\n\nHe rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s like you don\u2019t even want a girlfriend\u2026\u201d\n\n9:39. Still no answer from Mei.\n\nSuddenly, my phone vibrated. Joon always kept his on silent, but his eyes darted to it when the screen lit up. He blinked. Showed it to me.\n\nWe both had the same text.\n\n**UNKNOWN:** *KNOCK KNOCK*\n\nDownstairs, from the front door of the townhome, came knocking.\n\nJoon jumped. \u201cOoooh.\u201d He nodded. \u201cMei is *gooooood.* I take it back. She\u2019s giving us a good scare.\u201d\n\nI was too freaked out to say anything. I just really hoped it was Mei.\n\nJoon shouted, \u201cMei, is that you?\u201d There was tension in his frame as he called again. Then he put his phone to his ear, and snickered.\n\nI heard it, too. A tinkling sound of bells from somewhere just outside the front door\u2014Mei\u2019s ringtone.\n\nShe was outside.\n\nJoon pulled the phone from his ear and called out, \u201cCaught you, Mei! We know it\u2019s you!\u201d He smirked at me. \u201cBe back in a sec,\u201d he said, and hurried down.\n\nMy phone buzzed again: *KNOCK KNOCK*\n\nFrom downstairs, the click of the front door latch.\n\nI looked at the time on my phone. 9:41. Joon\u2019s time was almost up. Mei really did plan it all perfectly so she could arrive right when he was supposed to meet his end.\n\nI heard Joon, calling out the front door for Mei. Probably hiding somewhere to pounce on him. A moment later I heard the scuff of him putting his shoes on and stepping outside.\n\nMy phone buzzed.\n\n**JOON:** *Be back in a sec.*\n\nI was about to close the browser\u2014this browser, with the window open to the account I\u2019d been documenting of all this\u2014when my phone buzzed again. This time it wasn\u2019t Joon or the unknown number. It was cousin Clara.\n\n**CLARA:** *Hey, have you heard from Mei?*\n\n**ME:** *Yeah, why?*\n\n**CLARA:** *Oh thank goodness!!! She was supposed to meet me and Mom. The big show?? We got really worried! All our calls went to voicemail. Can you ask her why she didn\u2019t come?*\n\nThe show. Joon had mentioned the show, too. And now I remembered Mei talking about that show at the barbecue\u2014how she\u2019d spent weeks trying to get those tickets. And she\u2019d missed it? A sudden sickness twisted in my stomach, the dread dialing up from a tingle to a horrid lurch like the floor had just been ripped out from under me. I hollered: \u201cJOON! DID YOU FIND HER?\u201d\n\nMy phone buzzed.\n\n**JOON:** *KNOCK KNOCK*\n\nThe rapping on the door was so loud I jumped. It wasn\u2019t down the steps at the front of the building, but right outside my living room door.\n\nI hadn\u2019t heard any footsteps come up the stairs.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026 hello?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cLet us in!\u201d called Joon.\n\nRelief flooded me at the sound of his voice. I got up from my laptop and reached for the knob. I don\u2019t know why I hesitated, suddenly. I just\u2026 the feeling of dread was like a noose being pulled around my neck, cutting off the air. A warning. Some primitive instinct. Why hadn\u2019t there been footsteps? I called Joon\u2019s phone.\n\nIt rang for a while, then went to voicemail.\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering your phone?\u201d I asked.\n\nSilence. Then Joon\u2019s voice, near enough that it was clear there was only the wooden door between us: \u201cBecause I\u2019m\u2026 right outside the door?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I know it\u2019s you?\u201d His refusal to answer his phone stuck in my mind like a chicken bone caught in my throat.\n\nThe explosion of my phone\u2019s ringtone made me jump. I picked up the call, and Joon\u2019s voice said into my ear: \u201cHappy now?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, relieved.\n\n\u201cKnock knock,\u201d he said, and I could almost hear his smile. \u201cLet us in.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cBro.\u201d Joon sounded annoyed.\n\nMy phone buzzed.\n\n**JOON:** :(\n\nI quickly tapped back:\n\n**ME:** *After 9:50pm*\n\n**JOON:** :(\n\nHe knocked on the door. \u201cLet us in!\u201d He added, \u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous! *BRO!*\u201d He banged on the door. \u201cJust open the door! It\u2019s us!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Mei?\u201d I shot back.\n\nA long pause. Still no rustling or footsteps or any other human sounds. Then, Mei\u2019s sing-song voice: \u201cOpen the door!\u201d\n\n\u201cIn five minutes,\u201d I said. It was 9:45.\n\n\u201cYou seriously want us to just stand here in your hallway for five minutes?\u201d snapped Joon. \u201cCome on!\u201d\n\n\u201cLet us in!\u201d chimed Mei.\n\n\u201cLet us in!\u201d thundered Joon.\n\nBut the more they demanded I open the door, the more my pulse raced and my hands slicked with sweat. Why did it matter so much? What was five minutes? Sometimes with siblings, you get in these power struggles. That was what this felt like\u2014like maybe, it was just Joon trying to make me do things his way, annoyed with me trying to control him. Only, I *wasn\u2019t* trying to control him or Mei. I was genuinely afraid.\n\nAnd I refused to open that door.\n\nThe shouting and pleading continued, and my phone suddenly began vibrating so much that I had to snatch it up to prevent it falling off the desk. The texts were coming nonstop as the door kept rattling:\n\n*KNOCK KNOCK*\n\n*KNOCK KNOCK*\n\n*KNOCK KNOCK*\n\n*KNOCK KNOCK*\n\n*KNOCK KNOCK*\n\nAt 9:49pm, the sounds suddenly ceased.\n\nI waited several minutes, frozen in terror, and finally went to the door, hands trembling. Wrapped my fingers around the knob. Opened it.\n\nThere was nobody in the hallway. Only a few dirty tracks.\n\nStrange\u2026 Joon always removed his shoes before coming up. The front door was wide open, a cool breeze blowing in. I wandered down and peeked outside, then closed it.\n\nMaybe they were in it together. Maybe they were pulling some elaborate prank, like with the cockroaches. I went back upstairs and called Joon\u2019s phone again, hoping he\u2019d pick up. But there was no answer. I called and called. Nothing.\n\nI was just about to go out and look for him again when I noticed something facedown on the sofa.\n\nJoon\u2019s phone.\n\nHe must have left it in my living room when he went down to get Mei. I picked it up and saw my missed calls, as well as a bunch of texts from Clara asking about Mei and the show. He knew Mei was missing before he arrived\u2014that explained why he was so tense. But he didn\u2019t want to admit it, thinking she was just one-upping him on his prank. That also explained why he\u2019d been so relieved, in such a hurry to go meet her, when he\u2019d heard her ringtone.\n\nI also checked his text history.\n\nNone of his *KNOCK KNOCK* messages after he left came from this phone.\n\n\u2026 It\u2019s now near ten-thirty according to the analog clock on my bookshelf. And I\u2019m freaked out, because my phone and laptop are both frozen at 9:49pm, and have been for the past half hour. I tried calling Mom, tried calling Dad or cousin Clara or anybody, but the line is busy. No matter who I ring, it\u2019s busy. And my laptop, like all the frozen technology, isn\u2019t working. Luckily I can still type in the window that\u2019s already open. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing\u2026 documenting\u2026 praying I\u2019ll be able to post this and\u2026 and get help\u2026\n\nMy phone just buzzed.\n\n**JOON:** *KNOCK KNOCK*\n\nAnd now the phone slips out of my fingers, and icy claws rake down my spine, because the knocking came from *inside the room* and suddenly I remember how I peeked out the door earlier before I realized the clocks were frozen and words are now flashing across my laptop on their own as fast as I can think them and *let me finish typing for you* as Joon\u2019s voice chuckles like he always did when he landed a really good prank, back when he was alive, and he whispers right in my ear:\n\n\u201cHey, thanks for [*letting me in*\u2026](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)\u201d",

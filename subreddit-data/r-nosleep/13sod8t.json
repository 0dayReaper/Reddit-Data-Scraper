    "postText": "It stares in at me, pale fingers pressed against the window\u2019s glass.  It\u2019s raining hard now, and with the light from inside hitting it, I can see that the water running down from its white skin has a milky cast to it that the rain above doesn\u2019t seem to have.  Looking back to its face, I see it\u2019s smiling at me now, rows of grey peg teeth, too many teeth, and behind them a grey tongue twists in that greater dark as it tries to speak or laugh without sound.  I have the odd thought that its eaten too much candy and gone rotten inside, and its no wonder.  For all its strangeness, the thing outside looks like a little girl, at least until you get to its eyes.  They are black and cold and pitiless, and though it\u2019s probably my terrified mind playing tricks, I could swear there was something moving behind those eyes\n\n*worms*\n\nand that *they* are what is really looking at me and wanting to get ins\u2026\n\nAcross the house, I hear Alison start to scream.\n\n**** \n\n*Before*\n\n\n\nMy stomach lurched when my phone lit up and I saw it was Alison.  I didn\u2019t want to fight any more, and I didn\u2019t think talking about it again would help anything.  I\u2019d told her I wanted to break up two weeks earlier, and while that initial conversation had been sad and hard, I\u2019d thought at the time that it resolved things.  I\u2019d even hoped in time we could be friends again.\n\nBut the next day she called and wanted to talk again for hours.  And the day after that, and on and on.  The conversation never changed\u2014I felt like we needed to move on and find people that we\u2019d be more compatible with long-term, and she wanted us to stay together.  The longer I resisted giving in, the angrier and more bitter she got.  By the end of the week, she was accusing me of cheating on her, of lying to her, of using her.  I told her none of that was true, and I tried to stay patient because I knew she was hurting and not herself, but eventually I had enough.  I told her last week that I didn\u2019t think we should talk any more for awhile, and I hadn\u2019t answered her daily texts and calls since then.\n\nAnd that was my initial impulse this time too, but she kept calling.  Normally it was one call or text and she was done for at least a few hours, but when she called the fourth time in a row, I got worried something was really wrong.  Taking a deep breath, I answered the phone.\n\n****\n\n**Travis?  Are you there?**\n\n*Um, yeah.  I\u2019m here.  Is everything okay?   You\u2019ve been blowing my phone up.*\n\n**Yeah, no, everything isn\u2019t okay.  I\u2026I did something stupid.  I didn\u2019t really mean to\u2026I\u2019m not trying to excuse it, but I didn\u2019t really think it would work and then I went to take it back and\u2026**\n\n*Ali, what are you talking about?*\n\n**I\u2019m coming over.  Just don\u2019t open the door for anyone.  Keep the doors locked and please don\u2019t open the door until I get there.**\n\n*Look, I\u2019m really tired and I don\u2019t\u2026*\n\n**Travis, I need you to fucking listen to me.  This isn\u2019t about us.  If you don\u2019t listen to me, I\u2019m worried you might die tonight.**\n\n**** \n\nAnd then she was gone.\n\nI stared at the phone for a long time, my mind racing as I went back through everything she\u2019d said and tried to make sense of it.  What was she talking about?  Was she crazy or on drugs?  Was she dangerous?  It hadn\u2019t sounded like she was threatening me exactly, but people got weird sometimes when they\u2019re upset or hurting.  Still\u2026not that Alison didn\u2019t have issues, but I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d try to hurt me.\n\nI jumped when I heard a thump at the back door.\n\nMy first thought was that it was Alison, though I didn\u2019t know why she\u2019d be going around back.  Walking through the house, I turned on a couple of more lights, her frantic warnings echoing in my head.  She\u2019d sounded really scared.  But all the doors were locked, weren\u2019t they?\n\nThat\u2019s when I heard the knob on the back door start to turn.\n\nHeart hammering, I turned the corner and leapt at the door, slamming against it as I turned the deadbolt and then twisted the knob lock as well.  What the fuck was\u2026I moved off the door and over to the window looking out onto the back porch.  It had started raining outside, and it was late enough that it was fully dark, so I couldn\u2019t make out anything but a small dark shape leaning against the outside of the door.  It looked like a short adult or child, their ear pressed against the door as though listening for me on the other side.\n\n*What the fuck?*\n\nIt lifted its head away from the door as it caught sight of me.  A moment later it was framed by the window and the interior light, pale and terrible and smiling as it mouthed something silent to me with its pale lips and dark tongue.  Looking into its black eyes, I started to back away, but that\u2019s when I heard Alison\u2019s\n\n**** \n\n*Now*\n\nscreams and pounding from the front door.  It sounded like she was trying to break the door down, and maybe she was.  Running back to the front of the house, I started to make out some of what she was yelling.\n\n\u201cLet me in!  Fuck!  ....in now!  It\u2019s coming!\u201d\n\nI took the time to look through the peekhole in the door before opening it\u2014it was Alison, looking wet and crazy and terrified.  Under other circumstances, that might have given me pause, but at the moment, I didn\u2019t feel much different.  I threw open the door and she jumped in, ripping the door out of my grasp and slamming it shut behind her before turning the locks again.\n\n\u201cThey\u2026one of them followed me\u2026Oh God.  Have you seen the other one yet?\u201d\n\nI stared at her.  \u201cOther one?  What, there\u2019s two of them?\u201d\n\nHer eyes widened slightly.  \u201cIt\u2019s already here too, isn\u2019t it?  Oh shit shit SHIT!\u201d  She yelped and recoiled from the door as the knob began to rattle.  She looked to the door and back to me.  \u201cDo you have any guns?\u201d\n\nFrowning, I shook my head.  \u201cYou know I don\u2019t.  Look, what is this all about?  If this is some kind of prank, it\u2019s a really shitty thing to\u2026\u201d\n\nGrabbing the side of my face, she started crying softly.  \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s no prank.  I thought it was bullshit.  I\u2026\u201d  She trailed off as she looked around the room.  \u201cWhere did you see the other one?\u201d\n\nI swallowed.  \u201cShe\u2019s at the back door.\u201d\n\nNodding, she took my hand and pulled me further into the house.  \u201cWe need to go somewhere without windows\u2026um, your office.  That door locks.\u201d\n\nPulling my hand free, I stopped in the hallway.  \u201cWait, stop.  I\u2019m not going anywhere until you tell me what the fuck is going on.\u201d\n\nGrimacing, she grabbed my arm.  \u201cThere\u2019s not time for that.  We need to barricade a room until we can get help.\u201d\n\nI shook my head.  \u201cFuck that.  If this is so serious, I\u2019ll call 911 right now.\u201d  I pulled out my phone and held it up.  \u201cYou sure you want me to do that?\u201d\n\nShe had pulled out her own phone.  \u201cSure, go ahead.  If I can\u2019t get you to listen, let\u2019s at least get the cops on the wa\u2026I don\u2019t have a signal.  I always have a signal here.\u201d\n\nI looked back at my own phone.  It was the same, and while I went ahead and tried calling twice, there was no dial tone or ringing.  Looking up, I met Alison\u2019s worried eyes.  \u201cFuck.  Fine.  Let\u2019s go in there and you explain to me what the fuck this is.\u201d\n\nAnd after we were in my office and the door was locked and barricaded with a bookshelf, that\u2019s exactly what she did.\n\n**** \n\n\u201cI\u2026I haven\u2019t been dealing with this whole break-up thing well.  I mean, shit, you know that, right?  And I know I\u2019ve seemed crazy and then I started accusing you of stuff and\u2026\u201d\n\nSitting down in my desk chair, I snorted.  \u201cYeah, like cheating, which I never fucking did.\u201d\n\nShe grimaced and nodded.  \u201cI believe you.  In my head I do.  But the last few days have been really hard and I\u2019ve been really sad and bitter.  I\u2019d normally talk about stuff like that with\u2026well, with you, but since that wasn\u2019t working and you\u2019d had enough of my crazy\u2026which I totally get, but just saying\u2026.I went online and started reading different forums and stuff where people were mad at exes, got cheated on, wanted revenge, all kinds of stuff.  It felt like it was helping, just seeing other people in that kind of pain, you know?\u201d\n\nAlison slumped down against the wall.  \u201cI never posted anywhere.  Never gave anyone anything.  But somehow\u2026I get this email a few days ago.  No pictures or links, not selling anything that I could tell.  Just a few paragraphs describing\u2026well, it called it a revenge ritual.\u201d\n\nI stared at her.  \u201cA ritual?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe email called it The Night Hunt.  I know how it sounds.  At first I thought it was just an odd story or some viral marketing thing.  But nothing else like that came, and I couldn\u2019t even see the address it came from.  And it\u2026well, it stuck with me.  I tried to push it out of my mind, but I kept opening my phone and rereading it, and it didn\u2019t sound hard to do, and I didn\u2019t expect it to do anything really.  Of course I didn\u2019t.  I thought it was more like a cathartic thing.  Like when people burn someone\u2019s stuff after they break-up.\u201d  She looked back up, her expression haunted.  \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I did was real.\u201d\n\nI felt my stomach twisting at the fear and dread in her voice.  \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\nShe buried her face in her arms.  \u201cIt said to take a box.  You tie it up with a bow, but before you close it you put in something from yourself and the one that wronged you.  That and some paper.  You then take it to as close as possible to the place where you were wronged and bury it.  It has to be done at sunrise.  That next night?  The person that wronged you\u2026they get punished.\u201d\n\nI felt my pulse rising higher.  \u201cPunished how?\u201d\n\nAlison shook her head without looking up.  \u201cI don\u2019t know.  It was all bullshit, right?  I didn\u2019t think it was going to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what?  You hired someone to \u2018punish\u2019 me?\u201d\n\nShe did look up then.  \u201cNo!  You\u2019re not listening.  I\u2026I didn\u2019t really want to hurt you, okay.  I was just mad and sad about everything.  Yes, I got the box and did the thing, I went and buried it\u2026well, where you told me we were done being together.  But after that I worried about it.  I kept worrying about it all day, so after work today I drove back out there to dig it back up.  I felt dumb, but I felt guilty too.\u201d  She let out a bitter laugh.  \u201cBut then the rain came.  You know how people drive in the rain.  There was an accident and I was stuck in traffic for over an hour, and by the time I got out there, it was almost dark.\n\n\u201cI ran out there to get it\u2026I was feeling more scared about it now, though I didn\u2019t know why.  That\u2019s when I saw them.\u201d\n\nI leaned forward.  \u201cWho?\u201d\n\nShe gave me a hollow smile.  \u201cThose children.  A small boy and girl.  Dressed in dark clothes and with super pale skin.  They\u2026they were digging up the box.\u201d  Dropping her eyes, she went on.  \u201cI wanted to approach them, but just looking at them, even from a distance in the dark, I was terrified.  You could tell there was something wrong with them.  Not just how they looked and moved, but something more.  It was like radiation coming off them, how wrong they were.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I hid and I watched.  They opened the box, took out the note and the two things.  A necklace you gave me for my birthday a couple of years ago and that hat of yours you always wear around the yard at my place.  The boy kept the necklace and gave her the hat.  The next moment she was gone\u2026just kind of a weird shadowy blur like the film got sped up in one spot.  And the boy?\n\n\u201cHe turned and looked at me.\u201d\n\nShe paused for a moment, looking around.  \u201cDo you hear something?  I hear banging far away?  Or maybe it\u2019s my imagination.\u201d\n\nI strained to listen for a moment, but all I heard was the wind and the rain lashing the roof overhead.  \u201cNo.  I don\u2019t think so.  But so what happened with the boy?\u201d\n\nShe shuddered.  \u201cHe just started walking toward me.  Like Pepe Le Pew or something.  I don\u2019t know.  I just knew I needed to get out of there and I needed to warn you.\u201d\n\nLetting out a long breath, I looked down at my phone again.  Still no signal.  \u201cSo what\u2026who are they?\u201d\n\nAlison shrugged.  \u201cI don\u2019t know.  They aren\u2019t people.  I don\u2019t know what they are.  Just that she\u2019s after you and he\u2019s chased me all the way here.\u201d\n\nStanding up, I felt fear and anger bubbling up, but I tried to keep my voice even.  \u201cWell what did the damn email say about them?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust\u2026pretty much what I said.  It was more flowery and all, but it was basically just, this is a ritual to fuck with someone that fucked with you.  To rebalance things.  It said that I think.\u201d\n\nI shook my head.  \u201cAnd you just do this shit, not knowing what it\u2019s going to do or how it might hurt me, or you even?\u201d\n\nShe scowled at me.  \u201cI said I fucked up.  I said I didn\u2019t know it would really work.  Why would I think it was real?  Some magic shit?  But as soon as I did it, I knew something wasn\u2019t right.  And when I saw them\u2026\u201d  Her expression broke as she started tearing up again.  \u201cGod, I really am so sorry.  I didn\u2019t know.  I\u2019ll figure out a way to fix it.\u201d\n\nI was torn between wanting to comfort her and yell at her.  \u201cHow in the fuck do you\u2026fuck.\u201d  I sighed and looked at the ceiling.  \u201cWhat was this note?  You said something about paper you put in there.  What was that?\u201d\n\nAlison sat up more.  \u201cYeah, it was just like a line of French.  I copied it from the email but I don\u2019t know what it means.\u201d\n\nI stared at her.  \u201cJesus.  Just writing shit down and putting it in this fucking thing and you can\u2019t be bothered to google that shit?\u201d\n\nHer face began to turn red.  \u201cStupid.  I know.  But it was just a few words, and I didn\u2019t want to know.  I was\u2026\u201d She shook her head again.  \u201cI was afraid if I knew too much then I wouldn\u2019t go through with it.  And I thought I needed it.\u201d\n\nIce crept across my chest.  \u201cBecause you\u2026at least part of you\u2026you thought it might be real, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nShe was crying more freely now.  \u201cYes, okay.  Fucking maybe I did.  I\u2019m ashamed of it, and I\u2019d take it back now if I could, but yeah, losing you made me hate myself, and that made it feel okay to hate you too.\u201d\n\nSomehow, even in the middle of everything going on, that managed to hurt me more that I\u2019d expected.  Turning to stare at the wall, I asked again.  \u201cDo you remember what the note said?  Like what the letters or words were?\u201d\n\n\u201cI-I think so.  It was like ou latrie or un lautrie maybe?  Like that but a little longer.\u201d\n\nI searched my memory from a year of college French.  Suddenly, my mouth went dry.  \u201cWas it *un ou l\u2019autre*?\u201d\n\nI heard her suck in a breath.  \u201cYeah.  That sounds like it.  What\u2019s it mean?\u201d\n\nResting my head against the wall, I didn\u2019t try to hide the fear in my voice anymore.  \u201cIt means \u2018One or the other\u2019.\u201d\n\nI jerked back as I felt a dull thud in the wall.  \u201cDid you hear something again just now?\u201d\n\nShe nodded.  \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too.  I think it\u2019s the fucking access door under the house.  It comes open in the wind sometimes.\u201d\n\nAlison frowned at me.  \u201cWell, even if they go under there, there\u2019s no doors into the house, right?  And they don\u2019t seem to be coming in on us yet.  I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a rule of theirs like vampires or something or\u2026\u201d\n\nI looked around the room.  \u201cNo doors, but there\u2019s duct work under there.  And every room has vents.\u201d  My eyes landed on the vent in the corner of the room just as Alison began to scream.  \n\nThere were tiny pale fingers poking out of the vent holes, stealthily pushing the cover free so the path inside with us would be open.  I ran over and stomped on the vent cover with disgust, trying to crush the fingers between the lines of metal, but they were already gone.  Hearing another cry from Alison, I turned to see another vent in the far corner pushing up slowly.\n\n\u201cGet it!  We have to keep them out!\u201d\n\nShe did stand up then, and at first I thought she was moving to block the vent, but instead she went to the bookcase and yanked it aside enough to open the door partially. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?  Stop that!\u201d\n\nShe turned and looked back at me even as she slid through the gap.  \u201cOne or the other.  And it\u2019s not going to be you.\u201d\n\nI ran across to stop her, but she was already gone down the hall, and by the time I opened the gap enough to get through, she\u2019d made it to the front door and yanked it open.  The storm came rushing in, wind and water and darkness, and for a moment I was terrified she was going to just leave the door open and let them both in.\n\nBut no.  She thumbed the knob lock and went out, slamming the door behind her.  I ran to the window and looked out, watching in mute horror as she walked out into the rain.\n\n\u201cTake me!  It\u2019s my fault!  Take m-\u201c\n\nAnd then she was gone.  It had been like she said.  A dark blur, like a patch of the night went fast and then slow again.  One moment she is shaking in terror, calling out into the dark, trying to fix what she\u2019d done, and the next she\u2026just wasn\u2019t.  Less than a minute later, the rain stopped.\n\nThat was a month ago.  There\u2019s been no sign of Alison since, and though I did report her missing after \u201cdiscovering her car outside my house\u201d, I haven\u2019t told anyone about what really happened.  They probably wonder if I did something to her, but they\u2019ll never find any sign of that, or anything else, because there\u2019s none to find.\n\nWell, that\u2019s not entirely true.  \n\nBecause on that back window, where the thing that looked like a girl stared in at me, there is a permanent stain of ghostly white where her hand was pressed and dripped down.  Seeing it now, instead of running down, it looks like it\u2019s grown up\u2014a warped pale fungus or a twisted, evil tree.  Grown up from the ground of the park where me and Alison first kissed\u2026and where I told her we needed to end.  [Or maybe from the dark earth nestled in the shadowed corners of the human heart.](https://redd.it/9ndww5)",

    "postText": "The pit, the abyss, it was always there. At least, as far as I can remember. The first time I heard its call, it was subtle, almost unnoticeable. My mother was reading her pick-and-choose verses from the book, looking back up at me after each reading with an expectant look in her eyes. She tried so hard to belittle me, scolding me on how wrong it was to like men, but I was never swayed. Still, the call grew stronger every time she sat me down for her dogmatic ramblings, but it would only show itself to me later on in life.\n\nNot once did I believe she became a Christian in good faith. Way I see it, she only did so as a way to excuse her more toxic behaviours. It\u2019s no wonder I got into my first real relationship during college, since it was the first time I was really free from her endless remarks on my so-called \u201cdirty ways\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t know exactly what went down in the time I was away, but after dropping out of engineering and coming back home my parents were already living apart with divorce papers in order. And, like a pattern, propagating in time, Eric told me that this - *us* \\- wouldn\u2019t work out. My attachment blinded me to how shallow Eric was. He never said anything outright, but it was obvious how he saw me as lesser than himself.\n\nMy mum said that if, after finishing my engineering course, I *still* wanted to pursue carpentry, then I would have the skills required. I guess she hoped I\u2019d set my focus on greater horizons, but it didn\u2019t help me achieve anything.\n\nIt was better, living with just my dad. He helped me through it all, but it\u2019s always such a slippery rut I\u2019ve found myself in. I still dreamed of being a carpenter, but even he could see that I wasn\u2019t in the right state of mind to start a whole business. We ended up deciding that I would apply for some bog-standard transient jobs with the aim of saving up money for a carpentry course.\n\nThat never really happened. At 19, I started working at an office, spreadsheets, emails, that kind of stuff. Four years later, dad first started showing signs of early-onset dementia. At 54. It\u2019s such a hopeless feeling to watch your father degenerate into a confused mess, and looking back I think it would\u2019ve been better if he was struck by a heart attack.\n\nAfter two more years, I was up one raise and down everything else. It was January when the pit first revealed itself to me, a late weekend night of remote overtime, the only way I could afford the ever-rocketing living costs.\n\nThe work was harsh, mind-numbing, and I kept having to go back to fix mistakes, over and over, my tired mind fucking it up, as it always did. My feet were cold to the point where I could barely feel them, even when I tried moving and wiggling my toes around. I knew I was moving my feet, but there was no feeling.\n\nI looked down to see that, where the navy carpet had been, sat a circular hole in the floor. Almost perfect, but not. A gaping pit, walls of masterfully carved black stone, that descended into thick blankets of darkness. I forcefully pushed myself away from the desk, tumbling off my chair, then crawled over to the edge of the hole. As I peered over the crevice, the only sound was a low breeze. A cold earthen breath I imagined blowing throughout the tunnels of a cave.\n\nYou know that feeling? The call of the void? The subtle tug toward one step into nothing. I felt it. Only, the rejection of the idea that usually followed just wasn\u2019t there. It didn\u2019t scare me, only continued to pull me in. Gazing down into it, the knots in my stomach, pulled tight by the years, came loose. An unrestrained warmth took over my body as the pit seemed to strip away the weight on my heart, accepting the burden for itself.\n\nBefore the thought of toppling into the abyss took over entirely, my phone buzzed on the desk, breaking my trance. It was Eric.\n\n\u201cEric? What\u2019s up, man. Why are you calling so la-\u201d\n\n\u201cStop with the messages, Porter. I get you\u2019re sad and all but can you, like, take it somewhere else? I\u2019m with someone else now and I don\u2019t want you stirring up any shit.\u201d\n\nI looked up to the shelves above my desk for a moment. At the picture I had of Eric and myself at college. It was pathetic, years had passed but I still couldn\u2019t let go.\n\n\u201cHello? Tell me you understand.\u201d\n\nI brought myself back and replied,\n\n\u201cYeah. Um, sorry, Eric. Just hoped we might be able to stay friends at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, not if you go on like this. Thanks, I guess.\u201d\n\nHe hung up, leaving me standing there like an idiot. Well, that I was. The silence that replaced his voice rang in my ears, mocking me, and when I looked back down to the floor, the hole was gone. It left an emptiness in my chest that could only be made whole again by looking down into that dark abyss.\n\nThe gentle breeze from that pit followed me. I heard it inside, outside, day or night, sometimes loud and present, other times so distant I thought it was just the wind. Not really an earworm, though, it felt more like a reminder, making sure I didn\u2019t forget about the tunnel.\n\nLater that week I was in for work. Only half an hour after getting in, Dennis - my manager - called me into his office. Some bullshit about underperforming, I wasn\u2019t really listening to be honest. I rightfully disagreed, not out loud. I\u2019d been giving as much effort to the work as I could at the time. He won\u2019t be reading this, so fuck you Dennis. Your job is to *manage*, not to call in anyone you can get, and sneer down your nose at them. Asshole.\n\nI nodded to whatever he said, and left his office. My stomach churned, what was I meant to do? Work harder than I already was? I excused myself to the toilet, needing to steady myself. A spiral was already corkscrewing its way down my spine.\n\nI locked myself in one of the stalls and let my forehead rest against the door. Trying to calm your nerves can make things worse when you\u2019re on a tight schedule - how long could I stay here while also making sure my papers for the day would be all done by five?\n\nI turned around to see that, in lieu of a toilet, was the pit. How long had it been there, waiting for me? There was no spike of adrenaline. No, dopamine if anything. It\u2019d come back to see me, like it said it would.\n\nThe fluorescent buzz began to fade away as I fell to the floor, and so did the smell of floor cleaner and poorly-masked piss. My hands pressed into the cheap, sticky laminate floor as I lowered my face down into the abyss.\n\nThe cold whispering of air had changed. It sounded faintly like a whistle, distant but growing clearer. It was\u2026 so alluring. A lullaby crafted for me and no-one else. My arms reached down into the hole, pulling me further and further in. The darkness extended deep, deep down - I was on the fifth floor, yet I could see no end to its depth.\n\nIn that thick, heavy shadow, something moved upwards. Pale, angular, limbs too numerous and erratic to count. This would be my guide to wherever the pit led, to somewhere better. Peace and tranquillity. Charon is a misunderstood fellow - he only wishes to lead the dead to where they belong.\n\nThe melody was clear now. It was bittersweet, like reminiscing on bad choices, but accepting that the past is the past. The words to the tune came from my own mind, and I found myself whispering,\n\n\"*One step, into the dark,*\n\n*Light hides just beyond,*\n\n*No one will know, even dear old pa,*\n\n*Here is the peace for which you long.*\"\n\nIt was right. Who *would* know, and who would care? My mum, wherever she is, would likely be indifferent, and my dad would soon forget all about me. I clearly wasn\u2019t a valuable asset to the company either, and Eric would be happy to never hear from me again.\n\nAs the blurry thing in the pit grew closer, the song grew louder, all else falling away. The gentle breeze whipped up into a galeforce tempest of cold air that seemed to wrap around me like tendrils and pull me in further.\n\nI reached out my hand to meet my guide halfway, when the ear-splitting ***BANG*** of the bathroom door jolted me back to reality. Did I really want this? Was it really better on the other side? Whatever that thing was, approaching rapidly, I didn\u2019t want to know. I didn\u2019t want to meet it.\n\n\u201cPorter, you in here? Boss says the papers need to be done and signed by four, so hurry the fuck up, yeah?\u201d\n\nI arched my head back to the stall door and replied,\n\n\u201cYeah Jim, just a minute. Indigestion.\u201d\n\nThe door slammed again, leaving me alone. When I looked back down, I flinched as my head bumped into the toilet bowl, coming off slightly wet from the residue. No pit, nothing. I returned to my desk, and saw upon checking my email a message without any named sender.\n\n***COME BACK***\n\nThat\u2019s all it said. The song played over and over in my head while I stared at those two words. Out of my lips tumbled, \u201cI will,\u201d and I clicked off the email. I tried blocking the sender, more out of curiosity than anything, but there was no sender to block. I managed to finish my workload for the rest of the day and handed it in on time, with no particular gratitude from Dennis or anyone else. No surprise there.\n\nI paid dad a visit that weekend, at the hospice. When I entered his room he was staring listlessly out the window while some old songs fit for a gramophone played from the old radio beside him.\n\n\u201cHey, dad.\u201d\n\nHis head rolled around to look at me side-on.\n\n\u201cOh, hello there. What time is it?\u201d\n\nI could tell he was only trying to be polite, that he didn\u2019t really know who was talking to him, and changing the subject for that reason.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a quarter to three. How are you feeling today? I brought you some custard creams.\u201d\n\nHe turned around some more to look at me, down at my hands and then back up with a smile.\n\n\u201cThese are my favourite, how\u2019d you know?\u201d\n\nThe corners of my brow fell and I brought a hand up to block a potential tear.\n\n\u201cI, uh, it\u2019s me, Porter. I\u2019m your son.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\nThe look of confusion on his face told me all I needed to know. I\u2019d been able to remind him who I was before, but now it was no use. I was all but lost to him. Was he even aware he *had* a son? I don\u2019t know. There was desperation in his eyes, but the dementia won over.\n\nI didn\u2019t say anything more. I pulled up a chair next to him and sat, following his gaze out the window to nothing in particular. At least I could give him some company, even if he had no idea who I was. Looking through the smudge-covered glass I could hear that melody, whistling in my ears, and I knew it called to me again.\n\n\u201cWhat do you do when it seems the only direction you can go is off the edge of a cliff?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWait. Look around, far and wide, to see if there\u2019s a bridge across. If there\u2019s no bridge, then you better set about building one. Doesn\u2019t have to be rigid neither, just strong enough for one crossing.\u201d\n\nThe lucidity in his answer shocked me for a moment, and I understood what he meant, but I also couldn\u2019t grasp why he\u2019d still think that, when he was so lost and hollow like this.\n\n\u201cWhat if the bridge collapses halfway across?\u201d\n\n\u201cHm? Bridge?\u201d\n\nI sighed, \u201cnever mind.\u201d\n\nI stood, pulled the chair back to the corner, and left dad with his biscuits. Was that it? Had he forgotten all about me? The questions weren\u2019t answered as I walked out of the room. They say you die a second time - when your name is spoken for the last time. If I died that night, I\u2019d have already died twice. Not figuring in the people at work, because fuck them. Dad wouldn\u2019t be any the wiser, and mum wouldn\u2019t care. Nor Eric.\n\nMy sleeve was damp by the time I got home, wiping away tears so I could actually see the road. I don\u2019t know why I cared anymore. Perhaps I didn\u2019t want anyone else to get hurt.\n\nI unlocked my front door and went into the house. A cold and empty place that I called home. My whole body ached with anguish as I climbed my way up the dark staircase.\n\nI couldn\u2019t sleep, of course. Why would I be able to? A good night\u2019s rest wouldn\u2019t make dad better. It wouldn\u2019t make Eric come back, and it wouldn\u2019t help me become a carpenter. I couldn\u2019t even cobble the pieces of my life back together, let alone wooden joists or ply sheets.\n\nSlumped in the chair at my desk, I looked up at the shelves above. There was a framed picture of an eight-year-old me with my dad, doing some DIY carpentry on a doorframe, and on the shelf above, a picture of me and Eric at a college party. I loathed the sight of them. They were nothing but painful reminders of what I\u2019d already lost. It was all gone.\n\nI pulled out my phone and went to notes, writing a message to send to Eric. I hoped he was happy with the way things turned out, how he let me go over the pettiest of reasons. Life must be so easy for him, huh? Still, I couldn\u2019t break my attachment. I needed someone to guide me.\n\nI gave up a few sentences in, placing my phone face down on the desk. Hope was evacuating my body rapidly, but in truth, it wasn\u2019t a bad feeling. After all, why should I feel anxious or scared if there was nothing left to worry about? No, it was acceptance. This world was never meant for me.\n\nBut, I recognised the feeling. I knew instinctively what it meant. I looked down underneath the desk, but only saw the frayed, blue carpeting. I started cackling hysterically. It was funny. Now, I\u2019d even been abandoned by the pit that had called for me. This was it. My emotions, my dreams, leaving me one last time.\n\nA blast of freezing air poured over my head from above with a loud whoosh, and something wrapped around my throat. It was cold, clammy, and powerful.\n\nThe thing grasping my neck began to pull me up off the chair. My legs thrashed wildly, trying to find a foothold, and as I looked up, I saw it. The pit. It hadn\u2019t abandoned me, but in that moment I didn\u2019t want it anymore. A gaunt, pallid arm was reaching out of the darkness, clamping tighter and tighter around my neck, and it was attached to a mass of writhing limbs that wanted nothing but *me*.\n\nI scraped animalistically at the arm that I hung from, but it was no use. It was a grip of cold steel. I managed to kick a foot up onto the desk enough to give my body some slack, but it would be no use when I was dragged up further. I looked around frantically for something that could help, but the only thing in reach was the picture frame with me and Eric.\n\nHolding onto the bony wrist above me, I reached out with my free hand and grabbed the picture. I brought it up to my face and slammed it into my forehead. Blood erupted and poured down my face, but the glass was shattered. I felt lightheaded, and my feet totally lost footing on the desk, dangling uselessly. Using my teeth I picked out the largest glass shard still left on the picture, then dropped the broken item to the ground. I grasped the shard and I attacked. Slicing, stabbing, maiming the horrid limb that wanted my end.\n\nBut the world was fading, and fast. The howls and screeches of the creature above me sounded like they were underwater. I saw the rim of the black stone tunnel pass in front of me, falling away to reveal only cold and dark.\n\n*I can\u2019t go. Not yet. There\u2019s things I need to do, god, give me another chance.*\n\nI don\u2019t know how far I was dragged into the abyss, but hand\u2019s grip weakened, and it let go with a rage-filled wail. I didn\u2019t fall back into my room though, I just kept falling. The darkness twisted and swirled, shaping into visions of those taken victim by the pit. Those found dead with no clear motives - at least, none that could be understood by the living. I saw my father lying on his bed, drool leaking from the corner of his mouth, unaware of the gaping hole waiting for him just beneath the bedframe. I screamed, then passed out.\n\nI woke up gasping on the floorboards of my bedroom, lying on top of broken glass and dried blood. I shot up to a sitting position and looked above me. The ceiling was unbroken in its off-white mundanity. The pit was gone, and so was its call.\n\nMy body fell back to the floor, sobbing and heaving in exasperation. I was alive, somehow. Face all cut up, neck raw and bruising, palm lacerated messily, but alive. My flame had almost been snuffed out, but there was so much wax left in my candle. It couldn\u2019t go out yet, not until I saw what there was after it all melted away.\n\nI looked down at the broken picture frame. Eric\u2019s face stared back in a sneer, and I stood up and stomped on it until it was nothing more than split wood and torn paper. I needed him as much as he needed me. Dad needed me though. Even if he forgot who I, who *he* was, I had to stick with him until the end. I couldn\u2019t just leave without him.\n\nI\u2019m looking out the window at the first rays bursting from the horizon. Their warmth spills across my face, and with the warmth is calm. Different to the calm brought on by total loss of hope. Because there *is* hope. I don\u2019t know what for, but the fact that it\u2019s there is all I need.\n\nIf the pit calls to you, please think about what you\u2019re doing. It lies. There\u2019s no light past the shadows. It stays dark, and cold, and there is no salvation. I can\u2019t claim to know what the thing down there wants, truly, but it doesn\u2019t care about you.\n\nSitting here now, hell\u2026 [the sunrise looks just a little bit prettier than before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rephlect/comments/12prnjx/welcome_to_my_sub_stay_awhile/)\n\n___\n\n[RPH](https://www.reddit.com/r/rephlect/)\n\n[AB](https://www.youtube.com/@AshBreather)",

You've always had more hope than you were able to see clearly. For example, think: why did you ask what happens if the bridge collapses mid-way instead of asking how to build it? Because you had still hope in you and you went straight to trying to prepare for wrenches thrown in your way by external forces. \nI might not be making much sense but I'm very moved.",

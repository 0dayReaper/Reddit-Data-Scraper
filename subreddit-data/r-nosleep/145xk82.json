    "postText": "She said it so quietly that I barely heard her the first time. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cSorry hun?\u201d \r  \n\r  \nShe\u2019d been chipping away on a research project all week. I was in bed reading a book and enjoying my night. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cDo you ever feel claustrophobic?\u201d she asked again, more clearly this time, her face staring straight ahead at the computer screen. \r  \n\r  \nEmily knew that I was all about clear communication - if she wanted to initiate a break-up conversation, she could say her piece plainly\u2026 and maybe make some eye contact at the very least?\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t say that I do babe.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nShe softly nodded to herself.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDo you\u2026?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nShe stopped her scrolling for a moment. She still wouldn\u2019t turn and look at me\u2026 but she was thinking.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWho do you think put us here?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nHm. She liked to wax philosophical every now and then.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWell, I mean I can\u2019t say for certain, but I believe that humanity reached this point through events that were way outside of our control, like, y\u2019know, the big bang, cambrian explosion, evolution giving monkeys bigger and bigger brains, that sort of stuff. The holy trinity of chaos, time, and atoms doin\u2019 their thing I suppose.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nShe grimaced.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI thought you\u2019d say something like that.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe response was a bit out of character for Emily. She was a staunch atheist, and she used the phrase \u201cWe\u2019re all star stuff,\u201d much more than the average person, to the point where it\u2019d even get an eye roll out of me every now and then.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAnd what\u2019s your theory?\u201d I asked.\r  \n\r  \nShe continued mindlessly scrolling away at the computer. It felt like her research was the priority, and her conversation with me was a weird aside to keep her awake. After a minute of me feeling like a piece of furniture, she spoke up again.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMy theory is\u2026 we tell ourselves this is all a cosmic accident to make ourselves feel better.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAn eye-brow raising comment from her, for sure. I know she\u2019s the smarter half of our relationship, but\u2026 nah. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cReally? You think that accepting that everything around us is a cosmic accident is somehow soothing? You think it\u2019s comforting to think that when we die, it\u2019s all over?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nShe continued scrolling. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cYes.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI shrugged. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWell, uh, agree to disagree, I guess. I\u2019d much prefer to live forever.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou\u2019d much prefer to live forever\u2026\u201d she said under her breath. \r  \n\r  \nI felt like she needed to take a break from her work. Maybe the stress was getting to her. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cHey, you okay ba-\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI think that we tell ourselves that everything is meaningless and finite, because it makes us feel like we have control. Agency. That we aren\u2019t at the mercy of something we\u2019ll never understand.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI can\u2019t say I resonate with that, Em.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI think the creator leaves us hints. About what this is all about. And where it all goes.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAs she spoke, it felt like she was almost reading off of a website. I realized that I\u2019d never asked her what her research project was about.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhen you look outside, what do you see?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nChrist. She did seem off.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cUh, nature. I see nature, I guess,\u201d I replied.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat do you think of it?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI think it\u2019s beautiful. Don\u2019t you?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nShe shook her head softly.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s a mirage. It\u2019s pleasing if you don\u2019t zoom in or pay attention. If you do, it\u2019s a system of creatures devouring each other for energy. Creating more of themselves, devouring each other, reproducing again, devouring each other: an endlessly cruel loop. Have you ever seen an animal get eaten before?\u201d \r  \n\r  \nWhat the fuck Em. I needed to get her out of this headspace. Something was very wrong.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cUh, no, outside of a random Youtube video here or there, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen an ani-\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s not natural. Nothing about it looks natural. You see it, and it\u2019s a visceral hint that this whole thing isn\u2019t right. Nothing folds in and accepts its fate in the food chain. They all fight and claw and scream as they\u2019re torn apart. They cry out the exact same way a human would.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cBabe, you really shouldn\u2019t be watching shit like\u2013\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cBabe, you really shouldn\u2019t be watching shit like\u2013\u201d\r  \n\r  \nShe said the words out loud just as I said them. Like she knew exactly what I was going to say. She didn\u2019t lip-read or anything - her eyes were still straight ahead on the computer screen, her finger on the scroll wheel.\r  \n\r  \nI wanted to ignore it.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat, am I starting to get predictable?\" I asked her. \r  \n\r  \nShe didn\u2019t respond. But her breathing started to quicken. Short breaths in and out, reaching a frantic tempo. \r  \n\r  \nI got out of bed. I ran to her and turned her chair away from the computer. We locked eyes.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHun, what is your research project about?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nBetween her panic attack, she answered -\r  \n\r  \n\u201cFree will.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cFree will?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOnly one day into starting the paper, and I felt something calling to me. It all started to make sense.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat, what started to make sense?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat all of this is. What everything is. Energy, energy is-\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cGod, Em, shut up about energy, we need to like get you to a hospital or someth-\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNo, look, everything is energy devouring itself, right?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI realized that I needed to engage her to calm her down.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSure, yes, animals eat each other for energy. Bring home the point, hun.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThere\u2019s an energy inside us too. Something that can be devoured.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWell yeah, I mean we\u2019re a part of the animal kingdom, so I\u2019m sure if I ran into a lion or something it\u2019d eat me\u2013\u201d\r  \n\r  \nShe pointed at her chest. Her heart. Something inside her.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNo. *Us*. The real *us* inside. Our soul. Our *essence*. There\u2019s something out there trying to take it.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nIt was clear to me she wasn\u2019t well. I went to fetch my cell phone. I needed to get her to the hospital pronto. As I scanned the room, my eyes caught what was on her computer screen.\r  \n\r  \nA website that looked very dated. Early 2000ish. Amateur-ish.\r  \n\r  \nThe banner of the website read: *Emily\u2019s Free Will*\r  \n\r  \nWe were near the bottom of the page. \r  \n\r  \nOn the site was a script of our conversation. Right up until the words she just said: \u201cOur soul. Our *essence*. There\u2019s something out there trying to take it.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nMy exclamation of \u201cWhat the fuck\u201d echoed the very words I found myself reading on the website. I scrolled up. Everything her and I had discussed moments before was on the page. Identical to the word. \r  \n\r  \nI closed the website immediately. I turned the computer off shortly after as well.\r  \n\r  \nI held Emily in my arms. I told her that we\u2019d go to sleep and forget everything that happened. I told her to discard the project altogether, that a failing grade was fine, and that we just needed to bury this and put it behind us. \r  \n\r  \nShe disappeared a week later. \r  \n\r  \nThe search went on for weeks. None of us had a clue where she was. She left us with no hints on where she was going and when she was coming back. She was just\u2026 gone.\r  \n\r  \nAs the depression sunk in for her friends and family and the search dwindled down, I followed the one lead I had.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I was all alone, and away from the chaos\u2026\r  \n\r  \nI went to a secluded plot of land in the middle of the night, and after a few hours of digging, I found the coffin. I opened it up, and sure enough Emily was there, decay and all. The inside walls of the coffin etched in scratch marks. \r  \n\r  \nIf you\u2019re wondering how I was able to find her body, the coordinates were there on the website, right underneath the line: \u201cMark closed the website in disbelief, and didn\u2019t return for weeks after Emily\u2019s disappearance.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nOf course, this time I had to keep reading. Underneath the location of Emily\u2019s grave, was the final line on the page.\n\n\"And soon enough, Mark would wake up to discover himself buried as well. His body would never be discovered.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m still here. For now anyways. But if the moment that is written does come to pass, I ask that you look for me. I don\u2019t want my body to go unfound. \r  \n\r  \nEmily, wherever you are, I\u2019d like to change my answer to your question.\r",

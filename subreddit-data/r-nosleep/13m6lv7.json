I thought Art would have torn you to shreds by now. \u201c I ask, lighting a cigarette. \r\n\r\nThe small bungalow I\u2019m renting isn\u2019t much, but it\u2019s the most stable I\u2019ve been in a long time. After coming off of the path, the little annoyances and trials of day to day life, didn\u2019t seem so bad. And while I can\u2019t say I cut myself off cold turkey from any kind of drug, I\u2019m a couple of beers and a joint kind of person now, and I know, in my soul, I have no chance of going back to the shit I was pumping into myself. \r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a story in and of itself, not that anyone seemed to want to hear it mind you. \r\n\r\nBut he kept me locked up, wanted to use me to recoup some of the losses we caused. Six months of hell and torture, and I took a golden opportunity, with the help of a few friends, and escaped. \r\n\r\nThe Watchers of the Game found me, and I\u2019ve been with them ever since. \r\n\r\nBut you probably want to know why I\u2019m here, right? \r\n\r\nWell, these guys, I know they come off as a bunch of old blown out hippies, but they have\u2026 I feel like a fucking kid saying this\u2026 power. \r\n\r\nThey want Art to use as some kind of bargaining chip with his family, and we have knowledge, and experience they can use. \u201c Mike is relaxed, he stirs the instant coffee I made, drinking it almost without a grimace. \r\n\r\n\u201cYou, I get, I\u2019ve seen what you\u2019re capable of. \r\n\r\nWhy the hell would they want me? \u201c I say, displaying my left hand, missing two fingers and all. \r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to make their case, I just wanted to get a little face time with you before they do. \r\n\r\nI read your journals, and I spent a lot of time thinking about the things I did on The Path. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want you to feel dragged into this, I\u2019d love you at my back, I don\u2019t know why, but we worked well together. But, if you\u2019re going into this, I want you doing it with your eyes open. \u201c I see emotion on Mike\u2019s face, shame, fear, he drums one hand nervously on the cheap table. \r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t think there is a  thing on earth that\u2019s going to make me stick my dick in Art\u2019s meat grinder again. \r\n\r\nThat being said, you promised me something back on the path. Either way, I want to know, who the hell are you, really? \u201c I, on the other hand, am calm. \r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story, in fact, once upon a time, I did the same thing you did and wrote my twisted misadventures for the world to see. God damn, what was I thinking? \r\n\r\nBut the long and short of it? \r\n\r\nI\u2019m either a vigilante, or a psychopath. \r\n\r\nDon\u2019t give me that look,  I\u2019m not trying to be vague, just honest. \r\n\r\nBut either way, I\u2019m one in some other corner of reality, where the rules are set in stone, there are no ghosts, or werewolves, and certainly no demonic CEOs with short man syndrome. \r\n\r\nI saw some bad things, and because of that I decided to take matters into my own hands. Found myself involved in some conspiracy theory level shit, and before I knew it, I was wrapped up in off the books government ops, and all kinds of other shenanigans. \r\n\r\nThen I found myself\u2026 here, and found all the skills that I had were damn near useless. And this place was full of things much worse than the psychopaths I was used to. \r\n\r\nBut I also have a brain full of voices, back in full force as of late, and without a very specific set of  meds, well, I start to lose my grip on reality. You\u2019ve seen it, it\u2019s why I have the bond-villain eye and roadmap face. \r\n\r\nSo, who knows how much we can trust my memory. I could have just as likely been Jeffery Dhamer as Huston Jones, is what I\u2019m getting at. \u201c Mike stops making eye contact about half way through his admission. \r\n\r\nUnder normal circumstances, I wouldn\u2019t believe it, but why would he lie? \r\n\r\nThe Watchers arrive an hour or so later, three men in their sixties, and a woman who must be pushing 80, he eyes vacant, her face toad-like. \r\n\r\nThe man now sitting beside Mike seems to be their leader, short, slightly overweight, but with a strong build. He has a mid length white beard and wears square glasses with dark rims. His sharp grey suit puts him at odds with the retirement home hippie vibe the rest of his crew has. \r\n\r\n\u201cHello Kevin, I\u2019m sure Michael has given you a general appraisal of our situation, and our goals. \r\n\r\nWhat I am here to do is show you why you would want to aid my organization. \r\n\r\nWe are not the void born, I have no intention of making you an offer you can\u2019t refuse. \r\n\r\nBut what you need to know, Kevin, is that, the void, the energy that connects all the Woo-Woo nonsense, it leaves it\u2019s mark on people. \r\n\r\nYour last year is somewhat of a miracle, but some day soon, something or other is going to catch a whiff of the scent of your\u2026 adventures, and make itself known. \r\n\r\nOf course, we are offering you financial benefits. But beyond that, after you complete your contract, we will offer you protection. And believe me, in this world, things that live in the shadows are a dime a dozen, but a bright torch, well, that is rare. \r\n\r\nOh, how rude of me, Jim Randolph. \u201c the old man says, offering his hand. \r\n\r\nI shake it, feeling a bit overwhelmed, and out of my depth. \r\n\r\n\u201cMike didn\u2019t feel like answering this one, but I want your take on it. \r\n\r\nYou\u2019re making a lot of promises, and it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t believe them, but I\u2019ve got one question, why me? \u201c I hope my poker face is holding. \r\n\r\n\u201cMichael and yourself are nearly unique in that you have escaped the path, without any kind of contract with the entity you call Art. \r\n\r\nOne of you, is great. But two, the chances of something going wrong during our missions, is fairly high, having a spare would be a boon. \r\n\r\nWe understand that this is more than we can ask, but we also have resources the likes of which you cannot imagine. We promise you, your risk will be far outweighed by your reward. \u201c Jim makes eye contact, fixing me with a salesman\u2019s inviting, yet challenging stare. \r\n\r\nIf I told him no, well, I probably wouldn\u2019t have started posting these again, so I won\u2019t bore you with the obvious conclusion to this deal. I agreed, and two days later, I now owned my home, and found myself in an ancient VW minibus, towing a horse trailer full of what I assumed was the drug supply for my new employers. \r\n\r\nJim was driving, out of all the baked, shroomed out, acid-headed, old bastards here, he was a teetotaler. Wish I had his grit. \r\n\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s with all the drugs? \u201c I say, not one to shy away from a bit of weed, but starting to hate the pea soup thick hotbox of the minibus. \r\n\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t do drugs Kev, we smoke weed, we eat mushrooms, and sometimes, we drop a little acid. \u201c Albert, a skinny, perpetually giggling man in his 50\u2019s says, \u201cDrugs, they send out a signal. They tell every shitty thing around that you are willing to trade your soul. \r\n\r\nBut the good stuff, well, that\u2019s, tactical, man. Scrambles your outgoing signal, makes your soul slippery. \u201c\r\n\r\n\u201cOkay, but what about Jim? \u201c I take a pull from the sharpie sized joint that\u2019s being passed around. \r\n\r\n\u201cI was born lucky, no need for giggle sticks or fun stamps for me. \u201c the old man says, turning onto an exit ramp. \r\n\r\nOut of all the old folks here, he most certainly seems the oldest. \r\n\r\nWe park what I feel is the world\u2019s largest heat score at a small, out of the way motel. Mike and myself share a room, pouring over a Manilla envelope stuffed with information on the first part of our mission. \r\n\r\nArt, for all his bluster of being some kind of God, seems to have quite the network of support staff, and the Watchers of the game intend to go after these soft targets. \r\n\r\nThe first, are dubbed \u2018The Spaceshapers \u2018, and who we are meeting with tomorrow. \r\n\r\nThe depth of the information tells me that The Watchers have some deep contacts, the fact that there are still conflicting reports, and pretty large unknowns, tells me the types of things we are going after should probably be left alone. \r\n\r\n\u201cSo, fuck-face uses this cursed bunch of inbreds to make all his little pocket dimensions, and panic rooms by the looks of it. \u201c Mike says, he\u2019s making his way through a six pack at a pace that\u2019s quick, but measured. \r\n\r\n\u201cSeems to be, makes sense though. I mean, I can change a tire, but I\u2019m sure as hell not doing it myself if I can avoid it. \r\n\r\nElephant in the room, besides yourself, not seeing many people capable of, exerting pressure in our little group. \u201c I see the words \u2018violent\u2019 and \u2018unstable\u2019 repeated over and over in the dossier. \r\n\r\nMike laughs to the point of being obnoxious. He wipes the tears out of his eyes before answering my question. \r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2019 worry about them, they are packing some heat in ways I don\u2019t understand in the fucking slightest. \u201c My fellow traveler on the road to redemption or damnation explains. \r\n\r\nIt's noon, we\u2019ve been driving for hours, and I\u2019m sweating bullets for reasons that have nothing to do with my first paranormal face to face since, well, you know when. \r\n\r\nThe amount of drugs in plain view is staggering, mid level as they may be, but that isn\u2019t what\u2019s sending every bit of sketch-bag trained paranoia in me into overdrive. \r\n\r\nIn Mike\u2019s lap is a large chrome suitcase, inside this suitcase is a redneck\u2019s erection worth of guns and ammunition. Enough to send everyone in this rattling boat to jail for the rest of their lives. \r\n\r\nTo be fair, public intoxication could put half of the Watchers in jail for the rest of their lives. \r\n\r\n\u201cIf all goes well, we won\u2019t have any need for those Michael. \u201c Jim says without looking backward, \u201cThis, likely, will be a simple business transaction. \u201c\r\n\r\nA car full of watchers follows us, two of the youngest, men in their mid forties, exit the pale yellow corolla, their rough hewn hemp outfits are not identical, but they certainly shop at the same fucking store. \r\n\r\nThe massive building in front of us bears a sign, reading, \u2018Pop N Mom\u2019s Lumber Mill\u2019 and the building itself seems fit for the task. \r\n\r\nThe young watchers enter through immaculately cut oak doors. \r\n\r\nMike wears a drab, tweed suit, it\u2019s tailored well, but makes me think of cheap uncles at rich churches. \r\n\r\nJim checks in on the two periodically, default text notification noises letting us know that all is going according to plan. \r\n\r\nBut there is a break in the back and forth rhythm, a pause that turns into a silence, a silence that has everyone in the minibus shifting nervously as it drags on for nearly an hour. \r\n\r\nThe six of us jump as Jim\u2019s phone rings, he sighs, letting his exasperation hang in the air for a moment before picking up and placing the call on speaker. \r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to assume this is Edward? \u201c Jim says, one eyebrow raising in anger, as if the person on the other end could see. \r\n\r\n\u201cJim, I thought you\u2019d make it. \u201c The voice is confident, raspy, and with just a touch of malicious edge, \u201c I wanted to go over some of the finer points of our deal, in person. Which I was trying to explain to your guys, but they didn\u2019t want to hear it. \u201c\r\n\r\n\u201cOur deal, was finalized and of great benefit to all involved Edward. Why do we need to go through minutia now, at the eleventh hour? And why in the blazes can we not do this in a peaceful manner ? \u201c Jim is angry, I\u2019d find it comical, but this situation feels like the moments before a storm. \r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a yes or no question Jim. You coming in, or are we parting ways? \u201c  Edward\u2019s question is answered by Jim disconnecting the call. \r\n\r\n\u201cYou can bring two small firearms. And if you do anything more than make their existence known, it is only on my word. \u201c Jim reaches into the glove box and pulls out a collection of trinkets, playing cards, and errata I can\u2019t even guess as to the purpose of. But judging by the somber look on his face, they serve a similar purpose to the two automatic pistols Mike conceals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhoa, hold up there grandpa. We were told you only. \u201c Three men stand barring the stairs to Ed\u2019s office. All wearing blue jeans and simple brown t-shirts, brown belts, and scuffed workbooks. They are around six feet, early thirties, square jawed with a mustache straight out of the 90\u2019s. \r\n\r\nTheir resemblance is uncanny, not exact enough to be triplets  but something about that sets me on edge. \r\n\r\n\u201cAt this point, any pretense at sticking to our original deal has been thrown to the wind. \r\n\r\nEveryone is going to have to make concessions, and either my employees accompany me, or we leave, and take the vast wealth of funds and esoteria we are offering with us. \u201c Jim walks up to the man half his age, showing neither fear nor aggression. \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a pregnant pause, tension building. \r\n\r\nI look to Mike, and I don\u2019t see what I expect, which is a psychopath itching to pull a trigger. \r\n\r\nNo, while I\u2019m two steps away from pissing myself, and focussed on why these guys don\u2019t seem right to me, Mike is relaxed, hands no where near the well hidden pistols. \r\n\r\nWe walk up the stairs, lead by the three nameless men, Ed sits behind a functional plywood desk. Behind him is a tinted glass window, transparent enough to show the massive lumber mill behind him. \r\n\r\nAt first glance, nothing seems off, but the more I look the more I see things that tell me there is more going on here than the usual bullshit that comes with commercial logging. \r\n\r\nThere are dozens of employees, and my heart sinks as I see they all bear that same cookie cutter look. There is no genetic variation here, just slight twists on the same basic person, suited better to their roles in the sprawling warehouse. \r\n\r\nThe farther back I look the more esoteric and nonsensical the \u2018manufacturing\u2019 process becomes. Not that I know fuck all about wood work, but saws, and forklifts make sense, hunch backed doppelgangers splashing blood onto impossibly long planks on the other hand, not so much. \r\n\r\nI have no way to describe Ed, other than he feels like the original picture all of these clones or homonculai were Xeroxed from. \r\n\r\nJim sits, Mike and myself engage in an awkward staring contest with his\u2026 sons? \r\n\r\n\u201cSay how much more you want,  I wish our association to be as brief as possible. \u201c Jim says. \r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not as simple as that Jimmy, it\u2019s not just about money. \r\n\r\nThis deal you want me to agree to comes with a lot of risk, can you really put a price tag on that? On a man\u2019s safety? The safety of his family? \u201c Ed is enjoying this, I half expect him to light up a cigar. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe question isn\u2019t if I can, it\u2019s if you will. \u201c Jim\u2019s tone is curt, and at some point he has started to flip a coin through his fingers, an old silver dollar. \r\n\r\nThe nervous display from the old man does nothing to calm the fear I\u2019m desperately trying to keep off of my face. \r\n\r\n\u201cWell, my problem is, I don\u2019t think you have the pull to get me what I really want.  So who can you get ahold of that can talk turkey? \u201c Ed pulls out a tin of mints, and begins to loudly chew a small handful. \r\n\r\nJim is spinning the coin at a rate that seems nearly impossible, it\u2019s a grey blur in his hand. I seem to be the only one that notices. \r\n\r\nI can hear footsteps below, I begin to sweat in levels only rivaled by dope sick. \r\n\r\nI hear a ringing well before I see the coin launch into the air, then stop, suspended in mid air. \r\n\r\nI feel nauseous, there is utter silence, broken only by Jim\u2019s voice as he stands from his chair and begins walking away. \r\n\r\n\u201cMichael, I trust you can stall this situation for twelve hours or so until The Watchers and myself rectify it? \u201c \r\n\r\n\u201cFor a way home, yes. \u201c Mike says, as the old man walks leaves. \r\n\r\nI look around, everything from Ed and his \u2018sons\u2019 to dust motes are suspended, frozen in time. Besides our outmanned little group, that is. \r\n\r\nJim makes his exit, shaking his head and grumbling. \r\n\r\nTime starts again in a brain scrambling lurch, Ed and his sons looking around frantically. \r\n\r\nOne of the copy and pasted woodworkers pulls a pistol, a shining oak handled hand cannon, and aims it at Mike. A second later the second clone has a similar firearm trained on me. \r\n\r\nI have my hands up, my heart is pounding and I am regretting my decision to get involved in this bullshit. \r\n\r\nSomething about being on the path felt, less real, as stupid as that sounds. As dangerous as things were, the absurdity of them, seemed to take the edge off somehow. \r\n\r\nBut regardless of what the hell Ed\u2019s sons are, the blunt reality of the gun in my face is just as frightening. \r\n\r\n\u201cWhoa, how about we all relax. \u201c Mike says, fixing the son in front of him with a level look, \u201c You two with the pistols, this shit is between our bosses, no? \r\n\r\nWell, we don\u2019t want to go putting any more broken glass in this pudding than there already is, right? \r\n\r\nEd, sir, we\u2019re still at the bargaining stage here, aren\u2019t we?  Jim is going to get you set up, you showed him who is in charge, but you go adding nearly a half dozen bodies, you have to admit, that\u2019s going to put you in a weaker bargaining position once the contracts start getting signed. \u201c\r\n\r\nI can say nothing about Mike other than the man is full of surprizes. He calmly sits down, and puts his own weapons on the desk in front of him. \r\n\r\nAfter a long pause, Ed motions for his sons to put down their weapons. I slowly sit down, gripping the arm of the chair to try and hide my shaking hands. \r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose your right, and unlike my idiot kids, I know a gunfight in a cramped office isn\u2019t going well for anyone.\r\n\r\nYou two can be our guests until \u2018ol Jimmy gets his shit together. \r\n\r\nBut you two better hope that\u2019s sooner rather than later. I have hospitality, what I don\u2019t have is patience. \u201c Ed\u2019s threat sets my heart pounding. \r\n\r\nWe are taken through the massive woodshop, and for the first time since the path, I\u2019m surrounded by things that shouldn\u2019t make sense. \r\n\r\nI shouldn\u2019t have been surprized this place was equipped with literal jail cells, but still, it added to the whole industrial horror aspect of this wood mill  God forgot. \r\n\r\nIt takes us an hour to walk from one end to the other, impossible, even given the dimensions of the building from outside. And the state of the place by the time we reach our dank, mold ridden cells is surreal. \r\n\r\nThe clones are shambling, multi limbed horrors, some misshapen to the point of immobility, fused to rusted steel benches, repeating seeming meaningless tasks, or simply thrashing and screaming through deformed mouths. \r\n\r\nThe tools become less like anything one would find in a shop, and more devious, jagged pointed devices stained with rust and crimson. It smells of sweat and rot, like something very large with not long left to live. \r\n\r\nThe cell door shuts with a metallic bang that echoes through the building. \r\n\r\nMike lays on the yellowed, tiny mattress, looking up at the ceiling. \r\n\r\nI pace, starting to really feel the weight of my decision as panic sets in. I\u2019m rambling, and shaking, and becoming more and more irate at the look of calm that hasn\u2019t left Mike\u2019s face since this all started. \r\n\r\n\u201cYou want to show a little fucking concern here? \u201c I say, turning my panic outward. \r\n\r\n\u201cKev, I\u2019m concerned. We have to trust both Jim, and these things. A lot of shit can go wrong. \r\n\r\nThat being said, being trapped in a cell by some ego inflated bastard with one up on the world, that\u2019s my bread and butter. \r\n\r\nI, we, are going to play the game, but the second I feel we are going to lose. \u201c Mike smiles, wistfully, \u201c Well, you know where that goes. \u201c\r\n\r\nHis statement does nothing to calm me down, to stop the jackhammer my heart is becoming. And as I look at the mutilated state of his face, I can\u2019t help to think Mike over estimates his ability from time to time. \r\n\r\nSometime in the middle of the night, the door opens, and two of the homonculai, deformed things with faces that looked more like fungal blooms than anything human drag me out of the cell. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m confused, still sleep slowed and groggy. I try to question, but  if the pained, gurgling noises the bad copies make in response are an answer, I don\u2019t understand it. \r\n\r\nThey open massive set of repurposed barn doors and lead me into a room that is draped with foliage and vines. It\u2019s humid, and smells of compost. \r\n\r\nIn the centre of the massive room, rooted to the floor and the ceiling, is something, at first, I think is simply a tree. But the texture is wrong, the winding, looping cords of matter resemble flesh as much as plant life. \r\n\r\n The middle of the pillar blooms like a flower, thick ropes of purple tinted liquid fall to the ground. The overlapping layers of flesh like wood reveal what appears to be a woman, or at least something woman shaped. \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s beautiful, if not, clearly unnatural. She\u2019s easily ten feet tall, I\u2019d say she\u2019s naked, but her green and tan skin is covered with leaves and vines growing from her. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m stunned, my fear is tempered by an almost compulsive curiosity. Something about her seems at odds with the constant supply of violent horrors the paranormal has shown me so far. \r\n\r\n\u201cKevin, you and Michael are not the only prisoners here. I am bound to the lord of this place, I cannot leave without his command. \r\n\r\nOr, his passing. \u201c The plant like person pleads. \r\n\r\nI try to respond, something deep within me desperately wants to help her, but before I can speak, I wake up, pouring sweat and out of breath. \r\n\r\nI\u2019d say Mike is snoring like a saw, but that would be a bit too on the noise in my current situation. \r\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s where things sit. Me soaked and shivering in the cold cell, lit by nothing more than my dying phone, and wondering what if my dream was something meaningful, or, to coin a phrase, just a bit of undigested beef.\n\n\nLink to Part 2\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13qcl3m/the_big_rock_candy_mountain_book_2_finding/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button",

    "postText": "Growing up, my mum used to always say: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to listen or the ear fairy will come and take your ears away.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of kids out there\u201d she would go on to explain, \u201cwhose ears don\u2019t work too good. So if you\u2019re not listening, the ear fairy will take yours and give \u2018em to those little ones instead!\u201d\n\nI would, of course, either laugh or brush it off. It was said whenever I was visibly daydreaming while she was trying to talk to me, or when the teachers at parents\u2019 evening would tell her that I sometimes dozed off during long lessons. \u201cRemember to listen\u201d she would say. \u201cYes, the ear fairy\u201d I would interrupt, rolling my eyes. \n\nThen, one day when I was 15, it happened. The big event. I had begged my mum to let me go out with some friends to the local fields, and she said no because she couldn\u2019t drop me off and she didn\u2019t want me making that walk alone. I made the admittedly stupid suggestion that I drive myself there in her car - I had been watching videos and her own driving for years, and I thought it looked simple enough. She obviously said no, and wouldn\u2019t hear me out. My friends teased me, and I felt like I was being treated like a kid. So I decided, whatever, I was going to make the drive anyway.\n\nIt started off okay, but one wrong turn meant that in a mess of screeching, honking and screaming, I had crashed and destroyed her car. I managed to escape with only a twisted wrist, and no one else was harmed. But the car was gone. We weren\u2019t rich, but I guess I didn\u2019t realise how far from rich we were. My decision cost me and my mum everything. She couldn\u2019t afford another car, had to leave her job and we couldn\u2019t make the rent so lost our house too. It was a few months later, while we were staying at my Aunt\u2019s house, that she walked into the spare room I slept in late one day. The house was empty except us, though since she had barely uttered a word to me since the accident, it felt as if I were the only one there.\n\nI sat up, excited and confused to see her, especially since she was holding a sharp knife, and looked a little blank faced. \n\n\u201cMum, thank you for coming to see me. Really, I am so sor-\u201c\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t listen and cost your mum everything. So no, not mum. I\u2019m the Ear Fairy.\u201d\n\nI remember the pain, and the world being plunged into silence. I remember the blank look on her face. But everything else is a blur. Months of learning sign language, my mum by my side, the image of a supportive, worried mother, all a smudge in my memory. She made up a story, something about me not listening to her many warnings and trying to do some gardening using sharp objects by myself. A horrible accident. I didn\u2019t say a thing. I didn\u2019t think anyone would believe me. \n\nIt\u2019s been years now. I have been unable to hear for double the time I was able to. I\u2019ve never felt too bad about it, and still managed to live a full life. I did lose all contact with my mum. Moved out of there the second I could, having lived in fear the rest of my years there that she would snap again. I was the perfect son. Though, she never did show even a glimpse of that side of her again. \n\nI\u2019ve only started to see her again recently, once a week. She\u2019s really old now, and suffering. Some days she lights up when she sees me, others there\u2019s no recognition behind those eyes. The blank stare that still scares me. She\u2019s been losing a lot of weight, and most recently she\u2019s stopped talking completely. That hasn\u2019t effected my visits, obviously, but the doctors are worried. She has so little energy, they say, that she can\u2019t even open her mouth to talk. She waves at them feebly, but that\u2019s it. They look sad, worried. All I can think about is all the old people out there who would love to be able to speak.\n\nI visited again today. Quite late. She was asleep when I arrived, but I watched her for a while and she soon woke up. Confusion, then recognition and happiness on her face. \n \n\u201cSon?\u201d She signed slowly, hands shaking. \n\nHer eyes widened when she saw the knife I held in my hand. I placed it down softly on the bed so I could sign properly.\n\n\u201cNo\u201d I signed \u201cThe Tongue Fairy.\u201d",

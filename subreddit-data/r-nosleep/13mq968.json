    "postText": "I made it out of this alive. I wish I could say the same for everyone, but life sucks sometimes, and I\u2019m just a passenger.\n\n-----------------\n\nI wanted to tell my wife to stop provoking the psychopath in the cape, but I couldn\u2019t talk. No matter how hard I pushed, the only physical sensation I could produce was the feeling of gas moving through my colon. \n\nThe thin man looked pissed and was clearly out for blood.\n\nI think that helplessness is the greatest of all fears, because every terror is rooted in it. [Until you\u2019ve prepared yourself to watch your family die while completely paralyzed](https://redd.it/13gfxfr), you haven\u2019t experienced the level of fear that a human mind can endure. \n\nMalvern breathed in slowly. I don\u2019t know how to explain the fact that I *felt* his anger as he pulled air from around me; the emotions tumbled through the night like leaves caught in a wind, helpless to dance as he pleased. I was afraid and angry because that\u2019s what blew through me. \n\nStill paralyzed, I was unable even to wince as the bolt shot from Malvern to Kimmy. I would have thrown myself in its path if I had been able to stand, but could only watch what happened to my wife. \n\nVertigo spun me as I felt reality swirl. The world seemed to twirl as the energy moved around Kimmy like a physical object, banking half a turn and firing back at Malvern. \n\n\u201cYOU BITCH-\u201d\n\nHe only had time to speak those two words before his own rebounded energy consumed him in a deafening roar. \n\nI couldn\u2019t cover my ears as the sound became painfully loud, and I couldn\u2019t wipe my face when one of Malvern\u2019s eyeballs landed on my cheek with a *splorch.* \n\nGod *damn* is it creepy staring at a de-faced eyeball when neither of you can blink. \n\n\u201cElla,\u201d my wife wheezed, \u201ctake care of Daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDa?\u201d my two-year-old asked.\n\n\u201cYes, hun,\u201d Kimmy answered. She sounded like she\u2019d lived a thousand lifetimes. \u201cTake him to the car.\u201d\n\nI had some questions.\n\nBut a man needs both fine and gross motor movements to question things, so I just had to go with the flow as my daughter grabbed my ankle and hefted me before toddling toward the car. She moved my 191.3-pound frame like it was a blanket, dragging my face with ease over dirt and rock alike. Upon arriving at my wife\u2019s car, Ella tossed me against its side with a *thud.*\n\n\u201cGood girl,\u201d Kimmy breathed as she leaned next to me.\n\nMy frozen insides dropped ten degrees. \n\nKimmy\u2019s waist was stained with dark red blood. \u201cI know that you\u2019re staring, Russ, even when you can\u2019t move your eyes,\u201d she answered without looking at me. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s bad. Turning Malvern\u2019s own work against him was effective, but it came at a cost.\u201d She chuckled before devolving into a coughing fit. \u201cIt was worse for him, though, wasn\u2019t it? That inverted colon will be the least of his worries once he realizes the long-term damage I\u2019ve inflicted.\u201d\n\nShe staggered into a kneeling position. \u201cCome here, baby girl,\u201d she cooed at Ella. \u201cLet\u2019s get Mr. Bun to keep you company in your car seat, okay?\u201d\n\nThe next minute was dominated by a fussy toddler fighting a gravely wounded woman\u2019s attempts to get her into a car as her paralyzed husband did nothing to help. \n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Kimmy sighed, finally collapsing next to me. She smelled like copper and sweat. \u201cYou probably have some questions, Russ.\u201d She stroked my scalp, sending tingles through my body. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bear bad news, but you\u2019re not going to get the answers you want. Not yet, anyway.\u201d She winced, gingerly cradling her slender waist. \u201cI had to accept a certain amount of damage to put Malvern in his place. I\u2019ll never be quite the same, but I have a few tricks up my sleeve to stop the bleeding.\u201d Her nimble fingers danced down my cheek. \u201cI know you,\u201d she cooed.\n\nThen she grabbed my dick.\n\n\u201cJust as I suspected, Russ. All *voluntary* muscle movement has been suspended. I knew you had a thing for women in power ever since that one time you asked me to dress up like Xena.\u201d\n\nI did *not* appreciate several insinuations, allegations, and implications. \n\nI also did not have the tools to voice my discontent.\n\nIn addition, I lacked the tools to reject my wife\u2019s pulling down my pants and sliding myself into her. I was powerless against her, and could do nothing as an involuntary fart breathed into the night. \n\nKimmy had executed such a take-no-prisoners, badass move that even my involuntary breathing faltered. \n\nOf course, she was right about the \u2018women in power thing.\u2019\n\n\u201cAre you fucking serious, Russ?\u201d she squeaked. \u201cIt\u2019s been less than ten seconds.\u201d She sighed. \u201cWhatever. This will be enough to stop the bleeding.\u201d\n\nI had more questions. \n\n\u201cI know you have questions, Russ, but we don\u2019t have time for that kind of shit right now. Harvesting your seed is only a temporary fix.\u201d \n\nShe reached into the car and pulled Ella from her seat. \u201cGet Daddy into the car, okay, sweetie? He\u2019s too heavy for me to lift.\u201d\n\n\u201cGhaaa-thxxxx,\u201d my daughter responded. Then she bent down and heaved me inside with a single movement.\n\nI bounced around the back seat, pain rocketing through me as my limp limbs and rigid dick bounced painfully against tight spaces while I could not adjust.\n\nWhen I finally got my bearings straight, I realized that we were moving. Ella was strapped safely into her car seat, and Kimmy was squinting as she drove into darkness. \n\n\u201cI tried to keep you out of this, Russ,\u201d she explained, wiping her eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t stand a chance in our world.\u201d She let out a trembling sigh. \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry. I wish I had done so *many* things differently.\u201d Kimmy shook her head. \u201cBut it\u2019s too late. You\u2019re in it with us now.\u201d \n\nShe let out a small gasp.\n\n\u201c[They\u2019re still coming](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).\u201d\n\n---------------\n\n[They came](https://redd.it/13t5tbb)\n\n---------------\n\n[BD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/)\n\n\n\n[W](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcn_pa1QfNMRzbTuJqXSoRQ)\n\n[E](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)",

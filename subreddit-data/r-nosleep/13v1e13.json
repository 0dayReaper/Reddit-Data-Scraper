    "postText": "Hello all. I have written here before about my job at Ultima Resort ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10unu0x/the_last_resort/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3),[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10y9aaq/the_last_resort_the_house_always_wins/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3),[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11441tm/the_last_resort_murder_mystery_weekend/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3),[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11ba09t/the_last_resort_i_think_im_in_trouble/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3),[5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11o6mah/the_last_resort_hypothetically_how_bad_is_it_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3),[6](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12911nd/the_last_resort_angels_and_demons/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3),[7](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12nowby/the_last_resort_in_too_deep/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)), though I know it has been a while, sorry about that. We were trapped for some time, my phone died pretty quickly, and I wasn\u2019t able to recharge it again until the water receded. So, I haven\u2019t really been able to write. But I am getting ahead of myself. Let me get you up to date, then it will all make more sense.\r  \nI opened a door and peered into the closet, but the noise was quieter here, if anything. I shut the closet and continued down the hallway. The dripping had started out intermittent. The gentle plip, plip, plip was barely audible over the normal sounds of the hotel, and we had assumed it was related to the steady rain that had been drumming on the building for a few days, at that point. But the frequency of the dripping had been increasing steadily, and now was concerningly loud and constant. It was somehow audible from every corner of the hotel, and it was only a matter of time until the guests complained. They were already irritable because of the bad weather, which had kept them stuck indoors. As I passed a window, a flash of lightning lit the forest behind the hotel. The lights flickered ominously but it stayed on. The clap of thunder rattled the doors in their frames. I spotted Vincent hurrying towards me from down the hall. His face seemed pale.\r  \n\u201cWell, did you find the leak?\u201d I asked.\r  \n\u201cUmm\u2026 you could say that,\u201d he replied, uncomfortably, eyes shifting to the storm outside. \r  \n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\r  \n\u201cIt\u2026 well, you should just come see.\u201d\r  \nI followed him down the hall to the ballroom where we had hosted the anniversary party some days back. It had been a nice event. Less deaths than I had expected. The hors d\u2019oeuvres were pretty good. There was still a bit of smoke damage on the west wall, but we had cleaned it off as best as we could and the place looked presentable again, though I was now thinking we should put on a new coat of paint. It was hard to decide, when I wasn\u2019t sure if the room would even be here next week. Vincent opened the door on the back wall and gestured me inside. This was new. \r  \nIt was some sort of small storage cupboard, with dim lighting and a low ceiling. It was full of what looked like furniture, draped in white cloths for storage. I wondered what the furniture was made of, because the room had a strange fetid odor, that reminded me of rot and death. I covered my nose with my hand instinctively, but it did little to help. The small window in the back showed that the rain continued to fall outside, but it didn\u2019t seem to be the source of the leak, as the floor around it was dry. Still, the leak must be in here, because the sound was louder than ever. I took a step forward, to get a better look at the room, but Vincent grabbed my arm and pulled me back, pointing towards the ceiling. I looked up to see a large dome light. It had a strange dark tint, and hardly any light made it through. But something else was coming from the dome. Drips fell in a steady rhythm, and as my eyes tracked them, I saw them splash into a widening puddle on the ground. The puddle was viscous and black, glimmering in the dim light. I looked back at Vincent.\r  \n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I raised an eyebrow. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really look like ordinary water to me.\u201d\r  \n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe\u2026 it is picking something up as it drips through from the roof?\u201d he did not sound particularly convincing.\r  \n\u201cMaybe,\u201d I tried to play along. \u201cThough, I am not sure I want to know what that could be. Did you check if it is coming from somewhere upstairs?\u201d\r  \n\u201cYeah. Nothing out of the ordinary on the floor above, and I can\u2019t find any signs of a leak anywhere else.\u201d\r  \n\u201cAlright,\u201d I backed out of the door and closed it behind us. \u201cWell, I am sure whatever that is will work itself out.\u201d\r  \n\u201cWhat? We\u2019re just going to leave it? Why did we even bother looking, then?\u201d Vincent protested.\r  \n\u201cI was worried it was a roof leak, something we needed to handle with routine maintenance. That does not seem to be the case,\u201d I raised a questioning eyebrow. \u201cDo you know how to fix whatever is going on in there?\u201d \r  \n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d\r  \n\u201cMe neither. In this place, when the ceiling is dripping black ichor, it is probably for a reason. I assume we\u2019ll find out when one of our guests gets involved.\u201d\r  \nVincent opened his mouth, as if to protest, but even as he did, the sound of the phone at the desk echoed through the hotel. Vincent sighed,\r  \n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go see what fresh hell awaits us today.\u201d\r  \nI heard a small chuckle inside my head. I resisted the urge to ask Al what he knew. He answers were rarely helpful. He didn\u2019t seem to lie, but he was often intentionally misleading, saying whatever he thought would elicit the most drama. I was tired of giving him the satisfaction. I was sure I could sense his disappointment when I refused to engage, but maybe that was just wishful thinking on my part. I couldn\u2019t blame Vincent for being apprehensive about what the guests\u2019 inquiry might be. The three men had arrived to participate in some sort of golf event, but they been here for 3 days now and since it had poured every moment, the event was not taking place. The guests were very unhappy about this turn of events, and they had mostly been killing time by taking it out on us. That wasn\u2019t exactly a surprise. The rich ones were always the most demanding, unused to being told \u2018no\u2019 even when the question was \u2018has the rain stopped yet?\u2019, and based on the Bugatti they had arrived in, these men were quite rich. I answered the phone on the desk, already suppressing a sigh.\r  \n\u201cUltima Resort, front desk, how can I help you?\u201d\r  \n\u201cYou can come and open the bar,\u201d the voice on the other end snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s past noon and the sign says it should be available by now.\u201d\r  \n\u201cI apologize, sir. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d\r  \n\u201cYou had better be. The service at this place is frankly astounding. Honestly, I don\u2019t understand why anyone ever stays here. I have half a mind to leave a review warning people away.\u201d\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. I know your stay hasn\u2019t been ideal, but please bear with us and we will do everything we can to make it right.\u201d\r  \n\u201cYou can start by hanging up the phone and getting me my drink.\u201d\r  \nThe line went dead in my hand. I sighed and replaced the phone on the cradle. \r  \n\u201cLet me guess, they wanted to give us a large tip and leave early?\u201d\r  \n\u201cDon\u2019t quit your day job,\u201d I chuckled. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t make it as a psychic. Come on, let\u2019s go open the bar, before we have a mutiny on our hands.\u201d\r  \nI grabbed the key to open the shutters from the desk and we headed into the dining room. Our three guests were standing around the locked bar, making a show of checking their watches. I struggled to keep my eyes from rolling. It was 12:03pm. \r  \n\u201cYou know,\u201d Jack turned to the man next to him, but spoke loudly enough to be sure I could hear. \u201cThis reminds me of some of the dumps we stayed in before we made our fortune, you know? The little rat trap motels in the port towns we had to stay in.\u201d\r  \n\u201cThe customer service certainly leaves something to be desired, for a 5-star resort,\u201d his companion, Stewart, sniffed. \u201cFor the amount we are paying, I would expect better.\u201d\r  \nI turned the lock, opening the bar. I let them vent; I didn\u2019t particularly care if they left us a bad review, and I certainly couldn\u2019t do anything with a good tip, so they were free to hate it here if they wanted. It mattered less to me than they could possibly imagine. \r  \n\u201cCan you both hear that leak from your rooms?\u201d the final man, Lesley, asked.\r  \n\u201cCan we? I swear it is audible from everywhere in the hotel. There must be a dozen leaks in this old roof,\u201d Jack laughed. \r  \n\u201cIt would explain that,\u201d Stewart gestured to wet stain on the carpet across the room, oozing out from under a door I didn\u2019t remember being there yesterday.\r  \nI glanced over to Vincent, he shrugged,\r  \n\u201cI guess we\u2019ve got a new connection to the ballroom. That\u2019s kind of handy,\u201d he said quietly to me, stepping behind the bar and reaching for the rum to pour; it was all they ever ordered.\r  \n\u201cThat\u2019s another thing that reminds me of the old days,\u201d Jack elbowed Lesley. \u201cYou would think a landlocked hotel would be drier than a yacht, but here we are. Maybe you should get out a mop, see if you remember how, Les.\u201d\r  \nLesley stiffened,\r  \n\u201cI don\u2019t do menial labor anymore, Cap.\u201d\r  \n\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d Jack clapped Les on the shoulder. \u201cJust a joke, mate. The usual, my good man,\u201d he smiled at Vincent, who began pouring drinks. \r  \nAs day transitioned into evening, I left the dining room in search of absorbent material, to put down on the leak that was spreading persistently into the dining room. I found some cat litter in a back closet, and it seemed like it would do, for now, so I returned and began spreading it over the growing stain. Jack at the bar looked up blearily, watching my work, before finally declaring,\r  \n\u201cOh, so it\u2019s shit, then. That would at least explain the smell.\u201d\r  \n\u201cI think it smells more like a rotting carcass,\u201d Stewart interjected.\r  \nHe had a point there. Maybe I should get some baking soda from the kitchen. \r  \n\u201cYou know what?\u201d Jack concluded. \u201cLet\u2019s get this next bottle to go. We\u2019ll take it to our rooms for the night. I can\u2019t stand the smell down here another minute.\u201d\r  \nHe grabbed the bottle from the bar, then he rose and led his friends out of the dining room. I couldn\u2019t say I was sorry to see them go. Vincent circled out from around the bar and approached the soggy patch on the floor. \r  \n\u201cSo, is that the storage room?\u201d\r  \nNow that we were alone, I risked turning the knob and I opened the door to see the same storage room we had entered earlier, though now the light fixture was pouring dark liquid onto the floor, the drip having turned into a deluge. I slammed the door again. \r  \n\u201cMaybe we should get Manny,\u201d I concluded.\r  \n\r  \nManny stood back, watching the ichor pour down like a waterfall. It was pooling around our shoes now, even standing outside the doorframe. He stroked his chin,\r  \n\u201cHow long has it been like this?\u201d\r  \n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly sped up since we found it several hours ago. Any idea how we stop it?\u201d\r  \nManny closed his eyes for a moment, then frowned.\r  \n\u201cI think, perhaps, that we should move the food and water from the kitchen, so they don\u2019t get spoiled.\u201d\r  \n\u201cMove them where?\u201d Vincent asked. \r  \n\u201cTo the top floor storage closet. It\u2019ll be safest there. Come help me gather things up.\u201d\r  \n\u201cWhat, exactly, do you think is going to happen?\u201d I raised an eyebrow.\r  \n\u201cLet\u2019s just get to work, we probably don\u2019t have much time.\u201d\r  \nManny turned and strode into the kitchen. Vincent hung back and tapped my shoulder,\r  \n\u201cWhat does he know that we don\u2019t?\u201d \r  \n\u201cI have no idea, honestly,\u201d I shrugged, and Vincent headed off towards the kitchen. \u201cDo you know?\u201d \r  \nI kept my voice low, so the others didn\u2019t hear. \r  \nOh, are you speaking to me now? Al sniffed.\r  \n\u201cDepends, are you going to say anything useful?\u201d\r  \nPerhaps for a\u2026\r  \n\u201cIf you say \u2018for a price\u2019 we can go back to not talking. I am not trading anything for this.\u201d\r  \nI think you will find I am much more helpful if you are willing to make a trade.\r  \n\u201cI categorically disagree with that statement.\u201d\r  \nFine, I could feel him scowling. I can give you a hint for free. Maybe try asking yourself what he\u2019s hiding from you?\r  \n\u201cYour free hint is that he is keeping secrets?\u201d I raised an eyebrow. \u201cIsn\u2019t that true of all of us? That isn\u2019t exactly helpful.\u201d\r  \nWell then, perhaps you would like to make a trade?\r  \n\u201cWhy do I even bother?\u201d I sighed and headed into the kitchen to join the others. \r  \nVincent was helping Manny load food onto a rolling cart. The Chef was, fortunately, nowhere in sight.\r  \n\u201cGrab another cart and start loading the soft drinks and bottled water onto it. We don\u2019t have much time before we need to be in our rooms,\u201d Manny instructed.\r  \nI heaved a case of bottled water onto the cart, and we all got to work. By the time we made the final trip the carpet in the hall squished under my feet, oozing dark, foul-smelling liquid. It was coming in fast, now. Manny was probably right; we wouldn\u2019t want the food supplies getting contaminated with\u2026 whatever this was. After he finished stacking the last bag of rice in the closet, Manny closed the door and turned the key in the lock. \r  \n\u201cWell, we should find our rooms. It is getting late, and I doubt they will be in their usual place.\u201d\r  \nAs he turned to walk away, I noticed blood dripping down from his fingers onto the carpet. \r  \n\u201cManny, wait, your arm,\u201d I pulled up his sleeve to reveal a thin, but deep cut running up his forearm. \u201cWhat happened? Are you alright?\u201d\r  \nManny yanked his arm away,\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I must have scraped it moving a box.\u201d\r  \nIt didn\u2019t look like a scrape. It looked clean, with sharp edges, like a knife wound. But before I could say anything more, he was gone, disappearing down one of the halls.\r  \n\u201cYou ever wonder about him?\u201d Vincent asked.\r  \n\u201cWonder what?\u201d\r  \n\u201cWhat his deal is. Come on, don\u2019t play dumb. You\u2019ve noticed how strange he can be. How he seems to know things about this place he shouldn\u2019t. Surely, you\u2019ve considered that he might be\u2026 one of them.\u201d\r  \n\u201cOne of them?\u201d\r  \n\u201cYou know, one of the things that run this place, like the Chef. A demon.\u201d\r  \n\u201cManny? No, that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\r  \n\u201cWhy? He was here before you, maybe he was always here.\u201d\r  \n\u201cHe is nothing like the Chef or the Masseur. It\u2019s obvious that he is a person.\u201d\r  \n\u201cIs it? Maybe that\u2019s just another trick. Maybe he is here to torment us, to steer us wrong.\u201d\r  \nI shook my head,\r  \n\u201cNo, he\u2019s helped us, helped me, many times. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d\r  \n\u201cAlright,\u201d Vincent shrugged. \u201cBut I have a bad feeling about this one, Lucy. Something about that\u2026 water. It isn\u2019t right.\u201d\r  \n\u201cYou always have a bad feeling. Come on, it\u2019s time to get to sleep.\u201d\r  \n\u201cRight. See you tomorrow.\u201d\r  \nHowever he knew, Manny was right. I found my room on the 2nd floor, in a back hallway. Since it wasn\u2019t in its usual place, it took longer to find, but I did manage it before the deadline and locked myself in. Somehow, I could still hear the sound of flowing water, though. I could hear it everywhere in the hotel, in fact. In a way, it was soothing, people liked the sound of flowing water, right? So, keeping that in mind, I allowed it to lull me to sleep.\r  \n\r  \nThe morning arrived without fanfare, or a discernable difference in the light coming in through the windows. The storm continued to rage outside, and the clouds were so thick and dark that it was impossible to tell that dawn had broken. Still, my watch told me that day had arrived and so I left the room prepared to mop up whatever water had pooled downstairs and try to serve breakfast. No food had appeared in my room last night, so breakfast sounded very appealing. At least I could sneak a muffin or something. As I arrived at the stairs, I saw Manny standing on the landing, gazing down at the lobby.\r  \n\u201cIs the mess bad?\u201d I asked. \r  \n\u201cYou could say that,\u201d Manny didn\u2019t turn as I approached.\r  \nI reached the railing and gasped. The lobby was gone. The whole first floor was gone. All I could see was dark water, lapping against the stairs. \r  \n\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d\r  \n\u201cThat\u2019s not really a relevant question, in this place,\u201d Manny noted. \u201cLet\u2019s just call it a flash flood.\u201d\r  \nI jogged over to look out one of the windows, lightning flashed, illuminating an alien view, the lawn and garden were also gone. The only thing in sight was a sea of dark water, with the occasional tree protruding from the surface. \r  \n\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d I asked. \r  \n\u201cWhat we always do. Vincent has headed upstairs to lay out some food. We can help him, then lock up the rest and go clean rooms.\u201d\r  \n\u201cAnd if the water keeps rising?\u201d\r  \n\u201cWe keep moving up the floors, I suppose.\u201d\r  \nI stepped down the stairs until I was next to the water, and reached out a hand to touch the surface, wanting to test its temperature and texture. \r  \nStop!\r  \nI froze in place, hand hovering above the liquid, the command so urgent I couldn\u2019t ignore it. Trying to act casually, I rose and headed back up the stairs, \r  \n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go help with breakfast. Maybe we should put up a sign directing the guests to the 5th floor?\u201d\r  \n\u201cI\u2019ll handle that. We will have to ration the food carefully; we don\u2019t know how long we will need to make it last. Whatever you do, don\u2019t show the guests where the food is locked up, and only bring out enough for us to have a small meal.\u201d\r  \n\u201cRight,\u201d I nodded. \u201cSee you up there.\u201d\r  \nI turned and headed up the stairs. I waited until I was out of earshot to ask,\r  \n\u201cOk, what was that about?\u201d\r  \nDo not touch the water.\r  \n\u201cYes, I gathered that. Why?\u201d\r  \nBecause you belong to me. And I need you alive.\r  \n\u201cWhat is the deal with that water, exactly?\u201d\r  \nBut only silence answered. He was done volunteering things for the moment, apparently. I sighed and continued up the stairs. Vincent was waiting for me on the fifth floor, hovering by the landing, looking down over the dark, gleaming surface of the new lake below.\r  \n\u201cHave you ever seen anything like this before?\u201d he asked as I reached the top of the stairs. \r  \n\u201cNope, this is a new one.\u201d\r  \n\u201cI wonder if this is what being on the Titanic felt like?\u201d he mused. \u201cWater rising, nowhere to go, just waiting for the end.\u201d\r  \n\u201cWe aren\u2019t on a ship, though.\u201d\r  \n\u201cNo. Does that make it better, or worse?\u201d\r  \nI shrugged and Vincent passed me a bagel,\r  \n\u201cI figure we should eat the breads first; they\u2019ll go moldy in this humidity. We can save the rice, potatoes, and canned goods for later.\u201d\r  \n\u201cMakes sense. Do we have a way to cook any of those things?\u201d\r  \n\u201cI looked around. Some of the rooms have fireplaces, I guess we can hang a pot over the fire, cook that way. But maybe all this will stop before we get to that point.\u201d\r  \n\u201cMaybe,\u201d I wasn\u2019t exactly feeling optimistic about it. \r  \nI helped Vincent lay out some fruit and soft breads on the hall table, so that when the guests awoke, they would have something to eat. \r  \n\u201cWhat exactly are we going to tell them when they get here?\u201d Vincent asked, putting out some bowls. \u201cWe can\u2019t exactly say that the hotel is sinking and it\u2019s all perfectly normal, can we?\u201d\r  \n\u201cWhat else is there to say?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s some sort of flood. We don\u2019t know any more than they do. It\u2019s the truth, right?\u201d\r  \nHe considered that for a moment, then nodded.\r  \n\u201cI suppose it is.\u201d\r  \nA sudden commotion from downstairs drew us to the railing. The three guests were standing on the 2nd floor landing, looking down at the water, Manny was saying something I couldn\u2019t quite hear, but the response was clear enough,\r  \n\u201cWhat do you mean, underwater!\u201d Steward shouted. \u201cThis hotel is on dry land. We specifically avoided anything near the ocean or any major body of water. Where did all this even come from?\u201d\r  \n\u201cWe are located on a flood plain. It is possible that the dam broke upstream,\u201d Manny explained calmly. \r  \nDam, huh? That wasn\u2019t a bad explanation.\r  \n\u201cIf that is true, where are the authorities, shouldn\u2019t someone be here to evacuate us?\u201d\r  \n\u201cI am sure they will be here when they can. Until then, we just need to stay calm and safe. There is breakfast laid out on the 5th floor, please stay away from the water and we will relocate your rooms to the upper floors.\u201d\r  \nThe trio of men grumbled, but eventually they headed up the stairs. Vincent and I ducked back to our places. As they grabbed fruit from the table, Lesley scowled,\r  \n\u201cI told you we should have left days ago. We could have moved to another hotel. Now we\u2019re trapped here, in this dump.\u201d\r  \n\u201cOh, relax, Les,\u201d Jack chuckled. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in worse scrapes before. This isn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d\r  \n\u201cAnd if the water keeps rising?\u201d\r  \n\u201cI bet we could manage to make a passable raft, eh Stewart?\u201d \r  \nBoth men chuckled, sharing a private joke, but Lesley still looked anxious.\r  \n\u201cI didn\u2019t ever want to be out on the water again. We agreed.\u201d\r  \n\u201cSeriously, Les, just keep it together, alright? Let\u2019s just eat something and find some way to kill time. I am sure the authorities will send a rescue crew and we\u2019ll be out of here in no time.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI opened the storage closet and felt my heart sink as I looked on the nearly empty room. We were down to only a couple of boxes of crackers and a few bottles of water. We had rationed the food carefully, but it had been over 2 weeks now, and we had almost exhausted our supply. I wasn\u2019t looking forward to telling the others. Things had been getting tense. The power went out on the third day, and by now every cellphone we had was dead. Not that anyone could get a signal before that, anyway. The water had risen all the way to the fifth floor, so we were all trapped together on the top floor of the hotel, with nowhere else to go, if it rose any further. The guests had mostly given up hope for rescue, and the rest of us knew that was never a hope to begin with. So, now it looked like the six of us were just going to be trapped up here to starve, if we didn\u2019t drown first. I covered my face with my hands.\r  \n\u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d\r  \n\u201cVincent. No, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s not\u2026\u201d what was the point in lying about it? \u201cYeah, it\u2019s that bad. We are almost out of food, and the water has risen at least another foot since yesterday.\u201d\r  \n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d\r  \n\u201cI have no idea. Let\u2019s just get back to the group. We shouldn\u2019t leave Manny alone, in case the guests come out of their rooms.\u201d\r  \n\u201cRight.\u201d\r  \nWe walked back to the central hallway together. As we entered the room, I saw Manny with his back to us, removing a soaked shirt. Even in the dim light, it was clear that his back was webbed with dozens of scars and cuts. Vincent cleared his throat and Manny hurriedly tugged on a dry shirt. \r  \n\u201cI patched the hole in the roof,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe rain should stop getting in from there, at least. And I brought down a full barrel of rainwater and replaced it with an empty one.\u201d\r  \n\u201cThank you, Manny. At least the water from the sky is\u2026 normal. Because we are going to have to start drinking that water from time now on, I think.\u201d\r  \n\u201cAnd the food?\u201d Manny asked.\r  \n\u201cSome crackers, nothing more.\u201d\r  \n\u201cWell, I guess we will all need to tighten our belts, then.\u201d\r  \nA moment of heavy silence passed between us, before a door burst open and Jack emerged.\r  \n\u201cWhere\u2019s the food?\u201d he barked. \u201cWe\u2019re hungry and the table is bare.\u201d\r  \n\u201cFood\u2019s gone,\u201d Manny replied coolly. \u201cThere is water in the barrel, to take the edge off.\u201d\r  \n\u201cWe can\u2019t survive on only water.\u201d\r  \n\u201cWe can, for another couple of weeks.\u201d\r  \n\u201cSo that is your plan, to slowly starve to death?\u201d\r  \nManny shrugged but didn\u2019t reply. \r  \n\u201cWell, suit yourselves, I have a better plan.\u201d\r  \nJack turned on his heel and stormed out.\r  \n\u201cWhat do you think they will do?\u201d Vincent asked. \r  \n\u201cHe said already, didn\u2019t he? Build a raft,\u201d Manny replied.\r  \n\u201cMaybe that isn\u2019t a bad idea,\u201d I offered. \u201cWe could help, try to get out of here?\u201d\r  \n\u201cHas attempting to leave ever worked?\u201d Manny asked. \u201cNo, all we can do is hunker down until this resolves itself. And I don\u2019t think going out on that water is a good idea.\u201d\r  \n\u201cShould we try to stop them, then?\u201d\r  \n\u201cNo. If they are focused on building, it will keep them off our backs, for the time being. Let them do what they want.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nVincent and I spent the next few days watching the three men lash together furniture using heavy objects as improvised hammers and strips of torn bed linens as ropes. They seemed to actually have some idea of what they were doing, and they quickly fell into a rhythm, with Stewart and Jack doing most of the planning and construction and Lesley being ordered to fetch supplies and carry heavy objects. He grumbled about it, but did what they told him. They mostly didn\u2019t even notice we were there, as long as we made a show of occupying ourselves with some cleaning task or another. They never even bothered to ask why we were still cleaning and maintaining a flooded, sinking hotel all day. It was hard to tell if they just paid so little attention to us that they didn\u2019t notice, or if they simply figured it was our way of coping with the situation. Occasionally, they would ask us for some material they needed but could not find, and we would help as much as we could, then they would go back to ignoring us. On the third day, when the raft was beginning to look seaworthy, Jack sat back on his heels, admiring their handiwork.\r  \n\u201cWell, boys? What do you think? Will it float?\u201d\r  \nStewart rubbed his nose with his thumb,\r  \n\u201cI think it\u2019s as fine a vessel as we have ever crewed, captain.\u201d\r  \nJack laughed,\r  \n\u201cAnd you thought we had left those days behind us for good, eh chief?\u201d\r  \n\u201cThey are. But it looks like it will come in handy for us, one more time. Good luck, huh?\u201d\r  \n\u201cGood luck?\u201d Lesley\u2019s face turned dark; he had been increasingly dour over the last few days. \u201cI don\u2019t see the good luck in any of this. I think we are reaping our just reward.\u201d\r  \n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Les, this flood has nothing to do with us.\u201d\r  \n\u201cNo? You think all this is normal, then? It\u2019s been raining nonstop for weeks, the water keeps rising, no one has come looking for us. It\u2019s like\u2026\u201d he hesitated before continuing. \u201cIt\u2019s like we are alone in our own private hell. Just us and dark water everywhere. I don\u2019t know how you aren\u2019t thinking about it. I can\u2019t stop. I see his face whenever I close my eyes. I see the dark puddle in the bottom of the lifeboat. Maybe this is what we deserve.\u201d\r  \nJack backhanded him across the face,\r  \n\u201cPull yourself together, swabbie. And don\u2019t speak again until you\u2019ve regained your composure,\u201d he turned back to Stewart. \u201cNow, we need to get this to the roof before we finish lashing it together, or it won\u2019t fit. Then, we can either find a way to launch it, or we can wait until the water rises enough, what do you think, Mr. Stewart?\u201d\r  \n\u201cWell, captain, I say we rig up some ropes to lower it, because if we wait until the water is that high and anything goes wrong, we won\u2019t have another chance.\u201d\r  \n\u201cVery good. Alright, Les, help us lift these pieces.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe raft was relocated to the roof and the next 3 days were spent lashing it together and making the ropes strong enough to lower it the ever-dwindling distance into the dark water. When they were finally ready to launch, Vincent, Manny and I gathered on the roof to watch. I had to admit, I was really beginning to hope they succeeded, even if it didn\u2019t seem likely. We were still rationing out the last few crackers, but three or four crackers a day did little to even take the edge off of the hunger, which gnawed on my guts like an animal. If this didn\u2019t work, I wasn\u2019t sure what was going to happen. I looked over at Manny, his face grim and starting to look a little gaunt. As he turned to face me, I saw blood coating his neck and seeping into his shirt collar from a cut near his ear.\r  \n\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding.\u201d\r  \nHe reached up and touched his neck, bringing his hand aways stained crimson,\r  \n\u201cShaving cut,\u201d he offered, wiping it off absently with his hand.\r  \nI raised an eyebrow, but let it go. I had noticed Manny with little cuts or scars before, but he was always doing landscaping work or maintenance, so small cuts and injuries didn\u2019t seem unusual. But suddenly, in such close quarters and confined indoors, it was apparent that he seemed to injure himself more than I would expect. \r  \nCurious, isn\u2019t it? Al asked, speaking up for the first time in sometime.\r  \n\u201cYou have something to tell me?\u201d I mumbled under my breath.\r  \nNo, just noting that there is power in blood. I wonder what he uses it for?\r  \nPower, huh? That was probably worth thinking about. Later. For now, my attention was drawn to the makeshift ropes lowering the raft into the water. The raft settled into the water with barely a ripple, the liquid was entirely too thick and seemed to stick to the wood like oil, and the sound when it hit was less a splash and more of a splat. The three men looked at each other, confusion and concern on their faces.\r  \n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t much seem like normal water, Cap\u2019n,\u201d Lesley noted.\r  \n\u201cProbably lots of mud and silt mixed in, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d Jack waved away the concern. \u201cGet down there and then you can help us down.\u201d\r  \nLesley shook his head, mutely. \r  \n\u201cFine, Stewart?\u201d\r  \nThe other man didn\u2019t look happy about it, but he nodded apprehensively and moved to the edge of the roof and clambered down onto the raft. As it bucked and shifted under his weight, he lay down, waiting for it to stabilize, but instead, the rolling and pitching seemed to increase. Then, from the water under the boat came dozens of pale human hands. They were terribly bloated and marbled with green and grey. Corpse hands. Stewart looked down, terror written plainly on his face. \r  \n\u201cNo! It wasn\u2019t my fault. I didn\u2019t cause it,\u201d he shouted at the corpses looming under him in the dark water. \u201cYou want the captain, not me!\u201d\r  \nIf that was meant to mollify them, it didn\u2019t work. The hands gripped the wood and pulled, capsizing the raft and pitching Stewart into the water. He screamed as he hit the surface. Not just from fear, but pain. He tried clinging to flipped raft, but hands wrapped around his torso, trying to pull him into the dark. I could swear I heard whispers rising from the surface: Join us.\r  \n\u201cHelp me, please!\u201d he cried. \r  \nHe was too far down to reach from the roof, but maybe there was another way.\r  \n\u201cHurry, if we can get to the windows on the 5th floor, we can pull him in,\u201d I shouted. \r  \nVincent nodded and we ran down the stairs, searching for the room closest to him in the water. The screaming helped. When we dragged him inside, he was covered in scratches and bites from teeth that looked very human, some very deep and freely bleeding. His skin was stained from the dark water. The hands continued to reach for him, so I slammed the window shut, leaving them to paw at the glass, just as Manny burst into the room, followed by the other two guests. Seeing the seriousness of his injuries, Manny moved closer, kneeling next to me.\r  \n\u201cSome of these are very deep. We need to get pressure on the wounds. Go grab some towels,\u201d he instructed Stewart\u2019s companions. \r  \nHe inspected the bites and scratches more closely,\r  \n\u201cLucy, this bite is on an artery, press down on it hard, or he will bleed out. Vincent, go get some soap and water, we will have to clean this as best we can, under the circumstances.\u201d\r  \nVincent rose and Manny and I were left alone with Stewart, who seemed to have passed out.\r  \n\u201cYou seem to know what you are doing,\u201d I noted, pressing down on the bleeding wound.\r  \n\u201cI\u2026 I was a doctor, once,\u201d he didn\u2019t meet my eyes when he said it.\r  \n\u201cWow.\u201d\r  \n\u201cIt was a long time ago. Another life.\u201d\r  \n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever\u2026\u201d I was interrupted when Stewart\u2019s eyes snapped open. \r  \n\u201cI need a priest,\u201d Stewart grabbed Manny\u2019s collar, his eyes fevered and unfocused. \u201cI need to confess my sins, before I die.\u201d\r  \n\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to\u2026\u201d\r  \n\u201cWe killed him,\u201d he pressed on, oblivious to my objections. \u201cAlan Ross.\u201d\r  \n\u201cThe billionaire?\u201d I blurted, surprised. \u201cBut he died in a\u2026 shipwreck\u2026\u201d\r  \nI fell silent. I remembered the news stories; Ross had been on a luxury yacht on the way to the Cayman Islands when it wrecked in a storm. The entire crew was lost, except for the captain, the chief mate, and a single deckhand, who had survived in a lifeboat. Ross was in the lifeboat as well, but he had already drowned, before they were able to drag him on board. They had drifted for over two weeks, with his corpse, before they were found and rescued. It had been a major news story, about a decade ago.\r  \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like the news reported,\u201d Stewart gasped. \u201cWhen the yacht started taking on water, we should have stayed and helped to organize the evacuation of the crew. But Ross wanted to leave right away. He offered us money if we took just him and abandoned the others. We agreed, the captain and I. Lesley was just a deckhand, but he saw us leaving and followed. We quietly launched a lifeboat and fled, leaving the others to their fates.\u201d\r  \n\u201cHow did Ross die?\u201d I asked.\r  \n\u201cHe had a bag with him. It was so heavy he could hardly carry it. When he put it in the boat, it fell open and it was filled with diamonds. He was taking them to the Caymans. When we saw that, we\u2026 well, we decided. If he didn\u2019t survive the shipwreck, if the diamonds were never found, who would know? We drowned him and hid the diamonds. When we were rescued, we waited awhile, then we sold them, made millions. But it wasn\u2019t worth it\u2026 it wasn\u2019t worth this. The guilt\u2026\u201d\r  \nHe slumped to the ground. Manny met my eyes over the body,\r  \n\u201cI think we lost him.\u201d\r  \nAs I looked up from the body, I saw Jack and Lesley standing there in the doorway, towels in their hands. There was an ugly look on Jack\u2019s face. \r  \n\u201cI wish he hadn\u2019t told you that.\u201d\r  \n\u201cTold us what? He was raving, delusional,\u201d I attempted.\r  \n\u201cWe were standing right here,\u201d he replied.\r  \nI swallowed hard. Jack advanced into the room, holding a broken table leg like a club. \r  \n\u201cWe\u2019ve kept this secret all these years, it isn\u2019t getting out now.\u201d\r  \n\u201cWe won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d I protested. \r  \n\u201cThat isn\u2019t a chance I am willing to take. Besides, with the food supply exhausted, it was always going to come to this, eventually. Might as well get it over with.\u201d\r  \n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I heard Vincent call from the doorway. \r  \n\u201cLesley, take care of him, will you?\u201d Jack continued to advance on us.\r  \n\u201cPlease Jack, hasn\u2019t there been enough death?\u201d Lesley protested. \r  \n\u201cDon\u2019t act all innocent, you agreed to this, just like the rest of us. In for a penny, in for a pound, my friend.\u201d\r  \nI glanced around for a weapon. Between the three of us, we should be able to take him, but I didn\u2019t much like the look in Jack\u2019s eyes. Manny had stood, backing slowly away as Jack advanced. Then the captain took a swing at him, Manny jumped to the side and the makeshift bat shattered the window behind him. Jack\u2019s expression turned to one of horror as a pair of pale hands gripped the doorframe and a body began heaving itself through the open window. The broken glass sliced its bloated flesh to ribbons, but it didn\u2019t halt the creature\u2019s ingress. Dark, thick liquid that smelled of death oozed from its wounds. \r  \n\u201cAlan!\u201d Jack exclaimed, backing away swinging his bat at the creature. \r  \n\u201cYou owe me,\u201d it gurgled. \r  \nWe all backed out into the hall, but the creature advanced, slowly, leaving a trail of black liquid on the carpet as it walked. \r  \n\u201cIs it money you want? I can get you your money back, your diamonds,\u201d Jack offered.\r  \n\u201cWhat use do I have for money?\u201d it wheezed. \u201cYou owe me a life.\u201d \r  \nJack hit the body with his club, but it didn\u2019t slow its progress. He screamed as it reached out a hand and closed it around his throat. Jack was lifted off his feet and the creature carried him to the stairs and plunged him into the dark water. At first, he flailed and fought, but a dozen hands rose from the water, gripping every part of his body. When he was completely immobilized, the corpse released him, letting him be dragged down into the depths. Then, it turned,\r  \n\u201cNow,\u201d it spoke to Lesley. \u201cWill you fight, or come willingly?\u201d\r  \nLesley was trembling so hard he could barely stand,\r  \n\u201cPlease, I\u2019m sorry, I beg you, spare me.\u201d\r  \nThe creature\u2019s lips curled into a grotesque smile,\r  \n\u201cDo you regret what you did to me?\u201d\r  \n\u201cI do, I do. I never should have agreed with their plan. Please, have mercy.\u201d\r  \n\u201cDid you have mercy on me, when I begged?\u201d\r  \nLesley shook his head.\r  \n\u201cThen accept your fate.\u201d\r  \n\u201cWhat\u2026 what do you want me to do?\u201d\r  \n\u201cWalk into the water. Give your life willingly. Perhaps they will spare you, if you do,\u201d the creature laughed, dark liquid bubbling from its mouth.\r  \nLesley nodded haltingly and began to walk towards the stairs, stepping into the water, he walked down until he was submerged up to his waist. Then, the hands wrapped around his arms and torso and abruptly dragged him under. For a long moment, it seemed like he was gone, the same as Jack, but a moment later, he was thrown back onto the landing. Lesley raised his eyes, now as black as the water, and the creature smiled again, a tooth falling from its mouth as it did.\r  \n\u201cVery good,\u201d it burbled. \u201cYou have been baptized and born again into a new life.\u201d\r  \nLesley nodded, a serene smile on his face. Without a word, he rose and walked back into the room we had vacated only a moment before. Outside the window, the raft had been righted and floated serenely on the water. He looked down at Stewart\u2019s body, then picked it up and draped it over his shoulder. Glancing back at the three of us, he winked,\r  \n\u201cA snack for the journey.\u201d\r  \nThen, he stepped out of the window onto the raft and drifted away. \r  \n\u201cDon\u2019t suppose any of you would care to join him?\u201d the corpse of Alan Ross inquired. \u201cBe born anew in the cleansing water?\u201d\r  \nWe all shook our heads silently.\r  \n\u201cOh well, another time, then.\u201d\r  \nAnd with that, the corpse walked into the water and disappeared.\r  \n\r  \nThat night, our usual meals appeared in our rooms, and by the next morning, the water had receded, as if it had never been there. The electricity came back on, and the rain stopped. I was finally able to charge my phone and post this account. I tried asking Manny for more information about his time as a doctor but is as reticent as ever. I will keep trying, though, because Vincent and Al are right about one thing, there is something suspicious about how much he knows that he shouldn\u2019t. But, that is a problem for another day, after all there is no need to rush, we aren\u2019t going anywhere.\r  \n\r  \nUntil next time,\r  \nLucy",

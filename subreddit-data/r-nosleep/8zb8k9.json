    "postText": "As a kid I lived with neglectful parents at best. At worst dad would turn his screams and fists on me but I learned quickly how to dodge the worst of it. Mom wasn\u2019t much help, she\u2019d just smoke in the kitchen and bitch at him for staying out so late.\n\nAt the time we lived basically in the middle of nowhere, our nearest neighbors were a long walk away for a six year old and we had trees between us. No one to run to for help. But I was pretty small for a kid my age. I learned I could fit pretty much anywhere. The closet. Dryer. I think even once I tucked myself under my futon in such a way I could still get some air but no one could see me.\n\nI was a master at hiding. But it wasn\u2019t for a good reason.\n\nOne night though, one night I chose to do something different.\n\nI could hear it in dad\u2019s yells, he was pissed and was about to get violent. Mom wasn\u2019t helping either, just piling fuel onto an inferno of a flame. So I knew I had to find a good hiding spot. I\u2019d gotten the idea a few days before, when I realized the lattice covering the bottom half of the back porch had a hole in it. Not big enough to fit a full grown man, most likely, but it could fit a skinny six year old no problem.\n\nSo wrapping myself up in my blanket and grabbing my hippo stuffie, I snuck out my window and ran into the backyard. In the middle of autumn. When it was forty degrees out and the temperature was steadily dropping.\n\nI crawled under the porch, scraping my elbows and getting splinters in my palms but I fit inside. It was actually quite spacious compared to most my hiding spots, I couldn\u2019t sit up all the way but I had plenty of room to spread out my limbs.\n\nOf course I was also getting covered in dirt. It\u2019d rained a few days ago so the mud was still a little wet. I wrapped myself in my blankie the best I could and settled in for the night.\n\nBut soon, even with my blankie and my hippo, my teeth were chattering so hard I could barely breathe. I didn\u2019t want to go back inside though, knowing if my dad caught me I\u2019d be in for the whipping of my life. So I had to tough it out.\n\n\u201cHoney, are you cold?\u201d\n\nThat voice was not the voice of my mother, scratchy from all the smoking and screeching she did. It was sweet, like honey. I turned over to see the dim outline of a woman, lying on her stomach next to me. She had a pretty butterfly necklace and was just as dirty as I was.\n\nI nodded, not wondering how she\u2019d been down there without me noticing.\n\nThe woman belly crawled forward and wrapped her arms around me and suddenly I became warm. Like I was sitting next to a campfire. I snuggled into her arms, not minding the mud, after all we were both dirty.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten so big,\u201d the woman said, examining my face. \u201cHow old are you now, Alex?\u201d\n\n\u201cSix.\u201d How did I know this woman again? I didn\u2019t think I did.\n\n\u201cSix!\u201d The woman gasped. \u201cYou\u2019re all grown up then. I\u2019m so happy.\u201d She sighed pleasantly and stroked my hair. I\u2019d never felt so cozy in my life.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked.\n\nShe smiled, I could hear it in her voice. \u201cI\u2019m Lily. What\u2019s your favorite thing to do?\u201d\n\nI had to think for a second. \u201cI like board games. And coloring.\u201d\n\nLily chuckled. \u201cJust like me then. Could never get enough of Scrabble. But I guess you\u2019re still too young to play that, huh?\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cLotsa words. I wanna play it though. I like the tiles. Would you play with me?\u201d\n\nI heard Lily sharply inhale. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can. Your daddy put me under here, and I can\u2019t leave\u2026 but\u2026\u201d She thought for a second. \u201cAlex, could you do me a favor?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course!\u201d This lady was oh so nice. Why wouldn\u2019t I do her a favor?\n\n\u201cWhen you wake up in the morning, go to the police station. Ask for an officer by the name of Lowell Joyce. Tell him where to find Lily, okay? Under your back porch. He\u2019ll come and he\u2019ll get me, okay? And\u2026 and then maybe we can play Scrabble.\u201d\n\nYippee! I was too excited about the possibility of playing Scrabble to notice how Lily\u2019s voice caught at the end. I nodded vigorously. \u201cI\u2019ll do it! We can be on the same team, right?\u201d\n\nLily softly laughed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you understand the rules. Goodnight, Alex.\u201d\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I heard Lily\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cGo now. Your dad\u2019s gone to work. I\u2019ll tell you how to get to the station.\u201d\n\nRubbing my eyes, I crawled out from under the porch and went into the house to grab my shoes and a coat. I shivered in the frosty cold. But I thought Lily was right behind me.\n\nAfter my shoes and coat were on I started walking. It was long enough to get to the neighbor\u2019s house. I really can\u2019t remember how long it took to get to the police station, although I have no idea why no one pulled over to see what the hell a six year old in dirty pajamas was doing walking alongside the road. Lily kept guiding me onward.\n\n\u201cWait. Okay, cross the street now.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurn right here.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep going! You\u2019ve almost made it!\u201d\n\nI nearly collapsed with exhaustion by the time I walked into the station. The guys out front chatting and having a good time didn\u2019t see me until I almost made it to the front desk.\n\n\u201cWhoa! Kid! You okay?\u201d One of the officers knelt down to my level, eyes wide.\n\nI nodded. \u201cI\u2019m okay. Can I speak to Lowell Joyce?\u201d I asked.\n\nOne of the other officers picked me up. \u201cSure kid, sure, let\u2019s just get you someplace warm, holy shit your lips are blue\u2026\u201d\n\nI remembered quietly scolding the man about watching his language. \u2018Shit\u2019 was a bad word.\n\nI was given some warm cocoa and wrapped up in a blanket by the time an old man with a graying mustache sat by me.\n\n\u201cHey kid. I\u2019m Sheriff Joyce. What\u2019s your name?\u201d He asked.\n\n\u201cAlex.\u201d I set down my cup and looked him straight in the eye. \u201cI was told to tell you that Lily is under the back porch.  You need to go let her out so we can play Scrabble.\u201d\n\nI had never seen a grown man turn pale before.\n\nLots of things blurred together at this point. I remember being taken back to my house and there were a lot of police cars and people around. The back porch was surrounded by yellow tape, and someone was taking a black bag away while my dad was in handcuffs.\n\nAfter that, I lived with my grandparents. Sheriff Joyce and his wife.\n\nI tried to ask about what happened and who was Lily but I always got shut down. I was too young to know.\n\nBut life got better. A lot better.\n\nGrandpa was the best man I could\u2019ve hoped for in my life. We went out on weekends to the movies where he let me have the giant soda even though I\u2019d have to pee in the middle of the movie. When I asked if I could drink when I was thirteen he let me try a beer. I spat it out and didn\u2019t touch it again. He never judged me for my love of art, letting me paint my own bedroom multiple times over the years. I felt safe around him. He never laid a hand on me. My grandmother was amazing too, over the week she\u2019d homeschool me along with teaching me things that you wouldn\u2019t learn in a school, such as how to respect others but not take their crap. And cooking. Lots of cooking. I could make my own birthday cake by the time I was twelve. But I usually just made them for my friends. I got a lot of those, after I was free from my dad.\n\nWhen I turned sixteen, Grandpa took me back to my dad\u2019s house.\n\nThe whole thing had been bulldozed over. But I could still see the yellow tape wound around a few trees, faded and torn.\n\nWe sat together on the back of his truck. He opened a beer and drank half of it before setting it down and grabbing me an orange soda.\n\nAfter I\u2019d drank it he told me.\n\n\u201cLily was your mother.\u201d\n\nGood thing he didn\u2019t tell me as I was swallowing, I likely would\u2019ve had it coming out of my nose. \u201cMy mom?\u201d I questioned, confused.\n\n\u201cYour actual mom. The woman who lived with your dad was not your mother.\u201d My granddad grabbed another beer. \u201cLily was my daughter. I loved her so much\u2026 but when you were around six months old, she vanished.\u201d\n\nMy stomach dropped. \u201cMy dad just imprisoned her under the porch?\u201d I asked, starting to feel sick.\n\nGrandpa took a deep breath before setting his unopened beer down. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026. something I\u2019ve never been able to understand. Lily told you to find me? And that she loved Scrabble?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. She kept me warm that night. I probably would\u2019ve frozen to death if she hadn\u2019t been there.\u201d I was a stupid kid, even I knew that.\n\nGrandpa went dead quiet before he opened that beer and slammed the whole thing. \u201c\u2026 Alex, Lily had been dead the whole time she was gone. When we dug her up she was bones. Experts confirmed it, and your dad confessed to what happened. They\u2019d gotten into a fight and he threw her down the stairs. She\u2026 broke her neck.\u201d He clenched his fists. \u201cI knew he had something to do with her disappearance, but I never had proof until you walk into my station, covered in dirt and telling me she was under the porch.\u201d\n\nI was floored. I couldn\u2019t breathe. All I could do was shake my head.\n\n\u201cBut- I saw her! She was alive! She had this butterfly necklace\u2026\u201d I trailed off when Grandpa pulled an evidence baggie from his pocket.\n\nThere was that butterfly necklace all right. Rusty, and parts of the paint had chipped off, but I remembered it as clearly as I remembered Lily\u2019s voice.\n\nGrandpa took a shaky breath as he pressed the bag into my hands. \u201c\u2026 Lily loved you so much. \u2018ts why she stuck around that bastard. You were her whole world. She was constantly taking pictures and sendin\u2019 them to us in the mail. Sometimes a mother\u2019s love can accomplish things that no human can do.\u201d\n\nMy eyes overflowed with tears as I clutched the necklace to my chest. Choking on sobs, I leaned against Grandpa. He held me tight and I swear I felt a few of his tears land on the top of my head.\n\nAnd for just a brief moment, I swear I felt that warm love I felt that night under the porch.",

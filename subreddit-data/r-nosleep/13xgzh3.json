    "postText": "Season 2 Finale\n \n\u201cYou look worried Bruce,\u201d my producer jokes, moments before going live. \u201cEven for you.\u201d\n\nThis gets a chuckle from the crew.\n\n\u201cQuiet on the set!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m already shaking in my shoes. Not a good sign. Working for the Devil is extremely stressful. And dangerous. And certainly not for the faint of heart. Why I took this gig is beyond me.\n\n(Cue creepy music)\n\n\u201cGoing live in five\u2026four\u2026three\u2026\u201d\n\nI get the nod.\n\n(Cut to camera one)\n\n\u201cGreetings Hell Beings and hell raisers. Welcome to the Season 2 finale of\u2026.\u201d\n\n(Cue the audience)\n\n\u201cLET\u2019S MAKE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL.\u201d\n\nI wave my arms in the air.\n\nThe audience jumps to their feet. \n\nSomeone heckles.\n\n\u201cAlright. Knock it off.\u201d\n\nI serve up my best game show-host grin. It looks as fake as this cheap Hollywood studio.\n\n\u201cAs you probably know, my name is Bruce Davie, and I\u2019m the host of\u2026\u201d\n\n(Cue audience)\n\n\u201cLET\u2019S MAKE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a disturbance in the audience. A crew member forcefully removes someone. The commotion settles, and I get the go-ahead.\n\n\u201cPhew! A feisty crowd tonight!\u201d\n\nMy painted-on smile takes up the entire screen. So does my gleaming bald head.\n\n\u201cNow I know what you\u2019re thinking. What\u2019s the Devil got in store for us this evening?\u201d\n\nThe audience rumbles.\n\nI shrug.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I wish I knew!\u201d\n\nThis is true. But I\u2019m sure it has something to do with me spending an eternity in Hell. It\u2019s right there in my contract, which runs out after this episode. \n\n(Cut to camera two)\n\n\u201cSo, without further ado, let\u2019s bring out tonight\u2019s contestants, shall we?\u201d\n\nThe audience roars.\n\n\u201cAnd yes, you heard me correctly. Tonight, for the first time ever in this show\u2019s defamatory history, we\u2019ve got two contestants!\u201d\n\nAudience is on their feet, whooping and hollering.\n\n(Cut to camera three)\n\n(Cue music)\n\nA middle-aged couple promenade towards the podium. They\u2019re dressed like cowboys, and walk with a sense of purpose.\n\n(Split screen)\n\n\u201cWelcome, both of you.\u201d\n\nMore like: Welcome to your funeral.\n\n\u201cTell us a wee bit about yourselves, why don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n(Cut to camera four)\n\nThe woman speaks first. Her hair is amber, her complexion as pale as light beer.\n\n\u201cWell, Bruce. My name is Tammy. I\u2019m a stay-at-home mom. This here\u2019s my partner, Tex. He owns his own gun shop. We live in Austin Texas, with three beautiful children, who are with us here tonight.\u201d\n\nShe points.\n\n(Cut to overhead camera)\n\nTwo tall boys and a young girl, each dressed head-to-toe in denim, stand and bow.\n\nThe audience applauds.\n\n(Split screen)\n\nThe other contestant approaches the microphone. He\u2019s as tall as an ivory tower, with a voice like a banjo.\n\n\u201cHowdy Bruce. Good to be here.\u201d\n\nHe tilts his cowboy hat. His square jaw and rugged good looks give Chuck Norris a run for his money.\n\nI salute them.\n\n(Cut to camera two)\n\n\u201cWell then, now that we\u2019re finished with the formalities, I do believe it\u2019s time to\u2026\u201d\n\n(Cue audience)\n\n\u201cBRING OUT THE DEVIL.\u201d\n\n(Cue creepy music)\n\n(Cue pyrotechnics)\n\nThe stage fills with fire and brimstone. Pentagrams slice through the air. The Devil appears suddenly, dressed in a shiny new devil suit, tailored specifically for tonight\u2019s show. It\u2019s jet-black, and leaves little to the imagination. His pitchforked tail follows closely behind him as he approaches the podium.\n\n(Cut to Camera five)\n\nThe Devil wraps his arms around the two contestants, kisses them both on the cheek.\n\nTex, clearly perturbed, winces, then grudgingly wipes his cheek.\n\nThe Devil snarls, then looks him up and down.\n\n\u201cLooks like everything isn\u2019t bigger in Texas,\u201d the Devil teases. Suddenly, he\u2019s grown over eight-feet tall, and is looming over the tall Texan. \n\n(Cut to camera three)\n\nThe bright lights and furious makeup make me look like a cartoon.\n\n\u201cWhat an exciting night this promises to be!\u201d\n\nTammy steps forward.\n\n\u201cYou bet it is, Bruce. We\u2019ve watched every episode. We just love\u2026\u201d\n\n(Cue the audience) \n\n\u201cLET\u2019S MAKE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL.\u201d\n\n(Cut to camera three)\n\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Damion boasts. \u201cThis is Hell\u2019s most popular show. And for good reason.\u201d\n\nHe slaps the woman\u2019s backside with his tail, then raises his eyebrows mockingly.\nThe cowboy puffs out his chest, fists clenched, daring him to touch his wife again.\n\n\u201cWoah, easy there pardner.\u201d\n\nDamion nudges Tex. \n\nTammy is flushed. \u201cDon\u2019t mind Tex. He\u2019s the jealous kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh really?\u201d\n\nDamion\u2019s tail is now shaped like a lasso. With it, he snags Tammy and pulls her close. Her face turns tomato-red. \n\nThe cowboy grunts, pulling it off with one strong swoop. \n\nThe audience boos.\n\nThe Devil snickers.\n\nI feel sick. If this is to be my last episode (or final day on Earth), I don\u2019t want it spoiled by this denim-clad dude whose hat is bigger than his brains, or by Damion, who seems extra feisty tonight. Even for him.\n\n(Cut to camera one)\n\nI clear my throat.\n\n\u201cTell us, Tammy and Tex\u2026no, tell all of Hell\u2026what it is your beating hearts desire?\u201d\n\nThe audience is on the edge of their seats.\n\n(Split screen)\n\nThe Texans exchange doubtful looks. \n\nThe wife takes charge.\n\n\u201cWell Bruce,\u201d Tammy says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anything that might get us killed. \nBeing from Dallas, we were raised with some common sense.\u201d\n\nThe audience hisses.\n\n(Cut to camera five)\n\nThe husband steps up.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Bruce. Simply put, we want to be famous for a day. That\u2019s it. Then we can write a book and live off the royalties.\u201d\n\nThe audience erupts into a frenzy of catcalls.\n\n(Cut to camera three)\n\nThe Devil\u2019s eyebrows touch the top of his head. His voice slithers like a snake.\n\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d\n\nMy heart plummets. These Texans are flirting with disaster. If they\u2019d stuck to the script, they might be safe. They were supposed to ask for a lifetime\u2019s supply of Super Bowl tickets. Easy-peasy. Who do these cowpokes think they are? Do they really think they can outsmart the Devil?\n\n\u201cWell then,\u201d I say, shakily. \u201cI\u2019m sure Damion can arrange that.\u201d\n\nI raise my arms.\n\n\u201cWhat does the audience think?\u201d\n\nThe audience goes ballistic.\n\n(Cut to camera three)\n\nThe Devil, still towering over the Texans, leans into the camera.\n\n\u201cFamous, eh?\u201d\n\nHis lips smack against his face. When he touches the dude\u2019s shoulder, the cowboy swipes his arm away.\n\nThe audience boos. Someone tosses an egg onto the podium, narrowly missing the contestants.\n\n\u201cWoah! Easy does it!\u201d I spurt out.\n\nAll hell breaks loose.\n\n(Cut to overhead camera)\n\nThe crew gets busy, disposing of both the egg and the agitator.\n\n(Cut to camera one)\n\nI wipe my sweaty forehead.\n\n\u201cTough crowd.\u201d \n\nThe audience hoots.\n\nThe Devil sneers.\n\n\u201cSILENCE!\u201d\n\nFlames flash across the room. \n\nPeople shriek, including me.\n\n(Close up of Damion)\n\nThe Devil, boasting his gambler\u2019s grin, turns to the contestants.\n\n\u201cYes, yes. You WILL be famous. But just for one day.\u201d\n\nThe audience roars their approval.\n\nI shudder. Never in all my years, have I felt so much animosity from an audience. I\u2019ll be lucky to make it out alive.\n\n(Split screen)\n\n\u201cSounds like the Devil has a plan.\u201d\n\nI try to sound cheerful. But cheerfulness is the opposite of how I feel.\n\n(Cut to camera one)\n\n\u201cTell us Damion\u2026and all of Hell\u2026what you\u2019ve got cooked up?\u201d\n\nThe audience leans in. \n\n(Cut to camera three)\n\nThe Devil winks at Tammy.\n\n\u201cWell, I do believe it\u2019s time for those two cowpokes to become famous. Am I correct?\u201d\n\nThe audience jumps to their feet, chanting: \u201cFAMOUS.\u2026 FAMOUS\u2026. FAMOUS.\u2026\u201d\n\n(Split screen)\n\nTammy looks pleased. Her partner, on the other hand, is showing concern. His \nshoulders are tense, he\u2019s swallowed his bottom lip.\n\nDamion dazzles the audience.\n\n\u201cFamous, y\u2019all shall be.\u201d\n\nHe snaps his fingers.\n\nBAM.\n\nThe studio goes dark. \n\nSomeone in the audience screams. \n\nTammy gasps. \n\nTex grunts.\n\n(Cut to camera one)\n\nI shrug. \n\nIs this Damion\u2019s latest trick? Or did they finally cut the power? We give the impression that this show is hugely popular; but in truth, outside of Hell, this show is a dud. Cable and internet companies avoid us like the plague.\n\n(Cut to overhead camera)\n\nThe contestants vanish under a cloud of fog. \n\nA flaming pentagram floats across the stage.\n\n\u201cWell, isn\u2019t that just dandy!\u201d \n\nThe Devil points to the large screen behind the audience. \n\n\u201cMister and Missus Cowpoke are about to jump the falls!\u201d\n\nHe snaps his fingers, then he disappears. \n\nMy legs go weak. My heart is beating irregularly again. I still don\u2019t know he does it. How any of this works. Suddenly, I\u2019m alone on stage, shaking in my fine Italian boots, while the audience grows rowdier by the second. \n\nCameras mounted on drones are pointed at Tammy and Tex, who are trapped inside a large, steel barrel, with Niagara Falls looming below them. \n\nDamion flies across the falls, lands next to Tammy and Tex.\n\nHe taps the barrel.\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t she a beauty?\u201d\n\nThe audience hurrahs.\n\nThe barrel is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen. Although it\u2019s huge, and probably weighs a ton, it barely contains the two Texans, who are kicking and screaming, cursing up a storm.\n\n\u201cGet me the hell out of here!\u201d Tammy\u2019s voice rips through the noise of the falls. \u201cNOW!\u201d\n\nDamion frowns.\n\n\u201cYou wanted to be famous. Am I right?\u201d\n\nThe audience chants, \u201cFAMOUS\u2026. FAMOUS.\u2026 FAMOUS\u2026.\u201d\n\nTex pokes his head out of the barrel, cowboy hat and all.\n\n\u201cNow wait one minute, Damion. That\u2019s unfair. We wanted fame. Not death.\u201d\n\nThe Devil chuckles.\n\n\u201cThe two are synonymous, am I right?\u201d\n\nThe audience agrees.\n\nDamion checks his watch.\n\n\u201cWell then...\u201d\n\nHe slams the lid shut. \n\nThat\u2019s the end of the Texans, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n\n(Close up of Damion)\n\n\u201cWhatcha think? Should they jump the falls?\u201d\n\nThe audience shouts, \u201cJUMP\u2026. JUMP\u2026. JUMP\u2026.\u201d\n\n(Cut to camera two)\n\nMy insides are melting. I\u2019m petrified. You\u2019d think working with the Devil would get easier over time. You\u2019d be dead wrong.\n\n\u201cLooks like the people have spoken!\u201d I hear myself say.\n\nThe audience continues their chant.\n\n(Cut to overhead camera)\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Damion says, fiddling his fingers.\n\nHe looks over the cliff, and makes a sour face.\n\n\u201cWowsers. That\u2019s a long way down!\u201d\n\n\u201cJUMP\u2026. JUMP\u2026. JUMP....\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so much water!\u201d\n\n(Cut to camera one)\n\nMy worried-sick face appears on the screen. \n\nI straighten up. \n\n\u201cOnce they jump, Tam and Tex will surely be famous!\u201d\n\nExcept of course, they won\u2019t be famous. Not in this world anyways. They\u2019ve been duped. Why these people sign up to die is beyond me. Perhaps we\u2019ve reached a spectacular level of stupidity in human evolution. \n\n(Cut to overhead camera)\n\nDamion\u2019s lips stretch across his reddened face, his arms flex like a weightlifter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give them a helping hand.\u201d\n\nHe rolls the giant barrel to the very edge of the cliff, ignoring the banging and hollering coming from within the steel coffin.\n\n\u201cTammy, Tex\u2026\u201d His lips stretch into a snarl. \u201cPrepare for fame!\u201d\n\nThe audience is on their feet.\n\nDamion shoves the barrel over the edge.\n\n(Split screen)\n\nThe barrel tumbles down the falls, disappearing into the fast-moving water.\n\nThe audience holds its breath.\n\n(Cut to spy camera)\n\nInside the barrel, the Texans are shrieking. Their heads and arms and legs collide. Chunks of puke pour across Tammy\u2019s sickening face, who\u2019s calling Tex every name in the book, and it\u2019s a big book. Meanwhile, Tex is like a frog in a blender. His face is green, his nose is broken; blood is leaking from every orifice.  \n\nThere\u2019s a loud crash as the barrel plunders underwater.  \n\n(Cut to overhead camera)\n\nThe barrel resurfaces, traveling dangerously downstream.\n\nThe audience is back on their feet, fist-pumping.\n\n(Split screen)\n\nWhat troubles me is how the pedestrians and tourists, crowding the streets, remain oblivious. To them, this is nothing out of the ordinary. Nobody watches, or even takes a pic. I\u2019m starting to suspect foul play. Somehow, Damion is controlling this. He\u2019s using dark magic. A spell. Maybe none of this is real. Except of course, it is real. \n\n(Cut to camera one)\n\nI\u2019m trembling.\n\n\u201cWhat a jump!\u201d my voice ricochets off the studio walls. \u201cThey\u2019ll be famous in no time!\u201d\n\nThe audience chants:\n\n\u201cFAMOUS\u2026. FAMOUS\u2026. FAMOUS\u2026.\u201d\n\n(Closeup of the Devil)\n\n\u201cYes, yes. An excellent jump, I must say.\u201d\n\nHe peaks over the edge.\n\n\u201cLooks like they could use some help.\u201d\n\n(Cut to overhead camera)\n\nDamion flies towards the barrel, which is bouncing off rocks and debris.\n\n(Cut to spy camera)\n\nBlood. So much blood in such a tight space. Tammy\u2019s hair is in disarray. Her face is beyond repair. Tex swallowed his hat. One of his eyeballs is bouncing like a Superball. His left arm is flapping nonsensically. It isn\u2019t attached. \n\n(Cut to camera four)\n\nThe Devil scoops up the barrel, then flies to shore. When his feet touch the ground, he shakes off the water, cat-like, then glares at the camera.\n\n\u201cWhat a jump!\u201d\n\nHe cranks open the lip.\n\n(Split screen)\n\nTammy spills out. So does Tex\u2019s left arm.\n\nThe audience gasps.\n\nDamion applauds.\n\n\u201cSuch valor and swagger!\u201d\n\n(Cut to camera five)\n\nTammy is flopping fish-like, barely clinging to life. Her mouth is full of blood and brains.\n\nThe Devil puts his foot on her head.\n\n\u201cSAY CHEESE.\u201d\n\nFrom out of nowhere, a photographer appears.\n\nSNAP.\n\nDamion, looking pleased with himself, is suddenly holding a newspaper.\n\n(Closeup of newspaper)\n\nThe headline splashes across the screen: IDIOTS JUMP THE FALLS.\n\n(Cut to camera four)\n\nDamion shoves the newspaper in front of her face. \n\n\u201cLooks like Tammy and Tex are famous.\u201d\n\nTammy's eyes twitch. Clearly, she needs medical assistance. I\u2019m surprised she\u2019s still alive. Her husbands brains are splattered across the inside of the barrel. The very sight of this makes me gag.\n\nTammy tries to speak, but fails. Her eyes are filled with rage.\n\nDamion tosses the leftover arm into the water, then shrugs.\n\n\u201cSorry about your hubby.\u201d\n\n(Cut to camera two)\n\nWith wobbly knees, I face the audience.\n\n\u201cLooks like the barrel got the best of Tex!\u201d\n\nThe audience bellows.\n\nI continue to talk involuntarily. \n\n\u201cGosh dolly. Look at all that blood!\u201d\n\n\u201cMORE BLOOD\u2026. MORE BLOOD\u2026. MORE BLOOD\u2026.\u201d\n\nI find myself chanting along. \n\nSuddenly, my vision blurs. I clutch my chest. Maybe I\u2019ll suffer a heart attack on live TV. Hell waits for no one, I suppose.\n\n(Cut to camera four)\n\nTammy spits blood on Damion\u2019s boot.\n\n\u201cDevil be damned.\u201d I blurt.\n\nDamion\u2019s face twists into a ball of fury.\n\n\u201cNow, now, Tammy. That wasn\u2019t very nice.\u201d\n\nHe crushes her fingers with his boots.\n\nTammy yelps.\n\n\u201cI was gonna save your long-limbed partner over there,\u201d he points. \u201cNot anymore!\u201d\n\nThe audience is bloodthirsty. Paper airplanes and rotten eggs whizz past me. I duck just in time.\n\n(Closeup of contestant)\n\nTammy\u2019s tongue is leaking from her bloodied face. She\u2019s missing her front teeth.\nDamion digs his spiky heel deep into her blood-soaked abdomen.\n\n\u201cI reckon you\u2019ll need medical assistance.\u201d\n\nHe snaps his fingers.\n\nSuddenly, they're back in the studio. \n\nDamion is as happy as a filthy pig. Next to him is Tammy, who\u2019s caked in blood and gore. Her corpse-of-a-husband spills from the gigantic steel barrel, taking center stage. \n\n(Cut to overhead camera)\n\nThe contestant\u2019s children rush the stage. They\u2019re delirious.\n\nThe crew hurry out and drag them aside, along with Tammy, who's rushed to the hospital, where she will certainly die.\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019s what I call speedy service!\u201d\n\nMy voice appalls me. So does this job. If only I\u2019d listened to my mother, and got into politics.\n\nDamion snaps his finger, then disappears under a plume of dusty smoke.\n\n(Cut to camera one)\n\n\u201cWell, there you have it folks. That\u2019s the last you\u2019ll see of Tammy and Tex. But fret not, they had their moment of fame\u2026in Hell!\u201d\n\nThe audience is tossing trash onto the stage.\n\nI narrowly dodge a projectile.\n\n\u201cHope you\u2019ve enjoyed Season Two as much as I did.\u201d\n\nI hated it.\n\n\u201cAnd, unless the Devil strikes me down,\u201d and he very-well might, \u201cI hope to see you this Fall, for Season Three of\u2026\u201d\n\n(Cue the audience)\n\n\u201cLET\u2019S MAKE A DEAL WITH THE [DEVIL.\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromStarr/)\n\n[Season Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13oowiy/im_the_host_of_a_creepy_talk_show_lets_make_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n[Season One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/sew9lu/im_the_host_of_a_terrifying_new_game_show_lets/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)",

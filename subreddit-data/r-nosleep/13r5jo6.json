    "postText": "It all started after we saw the comedy film called *Tag* in 2018. For those of you who are unaware, it's based on a real story about a group of friends who played an endless version of the children\u2019s game. I think I enjoyed the film at the time, but I can\u2019t remember now. After years of this gradually-worsening hell, I shudder every time I remember the concept that inspired my husband, Elliot.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d He said.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d I replied, smirking. \u201cRight here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d He laughed, rolling his eyes. \u201cNot that. Tag. A never-ending game of Tag.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe live in the same house, so I mean\u2026 It probably wouldn\u2019t be as thrilling as the film,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019d just end up sitting on the sofa, constantly tagging each other in a back-and-forth slapping match.\u201d\n\nElliot pondered on my point, tapping his lips thoughtfully. He was always a passionate person \u2013 once he became hyper-fixated on something, it was hard to deter him, and I loved watching his face scrunch up as the cognitive cogs whirred away. But this time, my amusement at his fixation would be short-lived.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Elliot eventually said, as we hopped into the car. \u201cWe could make the game interesting. Only one person can be tagged per day. The game pauses until midnight, at which point whoever's It can tag the other.\u201d\n\nI laughed. \u201cMidnight? Well, I think we both know that the tagging\u2019s going to happen when we\u2019re both in bed, don\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nMy husband smiled. It wasn't an unpleasant smile, to my eyes, but everything seems different in retrospect.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s saying I\u2019d still be lying next to you?\u201d He said.\n\nEven then, when I still thought his suggestion to be light-hearted, the way he said that sentence set my hairs on end.\n\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re not gonna be an old, married couple with separate beds! Why don\u2019t we make the starting point 6pm?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cOkay. Wanna begin?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d I said. \u201cWho\u2019s It first?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d Elliot replied. \u201cI\u2019ll be a gentleman, and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2013 Tag! You\u2019re It!\u201d I squealed, laughing as I tapped his shoulder playfully.\n\nElliot smiled, keeping his eyes fixed on the road ahead. \u201cAnd it\u2019s 8pm. I guess I\u2019ll have to wait until tomorrow to get you back. You\u2019re going to be so easy to catch.\u201d\n\nAnd the next day, he proved that. At 6pm, on the dot, my husband silently emerged from a hiding spot behind the sofa and tagged me.\n\nI yelped, clutching my pounding chest. \u201cI didn\u2019t even hear you come home!\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go to the office today,\u201d Elliot giggled. \u201cI\u2019ve been hiding there for hours.\u201d\n\nWhen I arrived home the next day, I waited for my husband to walk through the door so I could have my revenge. 6pm came and went. At 7pm, I texted Elliot to ask when he\u2019d be home. He responded that he was sleeping at the office to avoid being tagged. And when he didn\u2019t show up the day after, I told him that Tag might cost us our relationship if I were never to see him again. His response infuriated me:\n\nNice try. Ultimatums won\u2019t work. I don\u2019t want to be It.\n\nWhen I told him that he\u2019d better come home, his response sparked a ripple of shivers across my body:\n\nOh, but I am home, darling. You just haven\u2019t seen me yet.\n\nThen I heard a slightest creak from the cupboard beneath the sink. When I opened the double-doors, there was my husband. And ordinarily, that would\u2019ve been a funny sight, wouldn\u2019t it? Just a game of Tag that had reached dizzying heights of ridiculousness.\n\nBut you didn\u2019t see his face. That wasn\u2019t Elliot. Not my Elliot. Bulging, unblinking, bloodshot eyes. Unhinged smile, frothing at the lips. That giggle.\n\nEver since he suggested we play Tag, the man I knew was gone. Throughout lockdown, given that we were living in such close quarters, the game did become slightly easier, but Elliot lost a piece of himself with every passing day. I tried to get him to hyper-fixate on something else. No use.\n\nStill, whenever one of us had been tagged and the game paused, my husband returned to his normal self. That was when I decided I was going to stop playing \u2014 it was the only way to get him back. So, Elliot tagged me, and I didn\u2019t return the tag on the following day. For months, things returned to normal. But then, one day, at a local restaurant, he brought up the topic again.\n\n\u201cLisa\u2026\u201d Elliot started.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m right in front of you,\u201d He said. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you tag me?\u201d\n\nI sighed. \u201cYou were making me uncomfortable, Elliot. You weren\u2019t yourself when you were It.\u201d\n\nA fleeting glint in his eye sent a weighty lump of fear cascading to the pit of my stomach. It was a glimmer of cruelty that had been burgeoning beneath the surface of his cold, unfeeling eyes for three years. The look that I\u2019d hoped would go away if I were to stop playing his haunted game.\n\nThe true horror had yet to begin.\n\n\u201cThis won\u2019t do at all, Lisa,\u201d He whispered in a voice hardly his own. \u201cI\u2019ve been patient. I thought you were planning the ultimate move. I\u2019m going to have to make a new rule. When someone is It, they must make an effort to tag the other player. Otherwise, the other player becomes It.\u201d\n\nI scoffed. \u201cLook, I\u2019d happily play the game if you could be normal about it.\u201d\n\nElliot smiled. \u201cOf course. I won\u2019t take it too seriously. It\u2019s fun, Lisa. That\u2019s why I want to play.\u201d\n\nThis was a little over a year ago, and it was anything but fun after that. I couldn\u2019t decide whether I feared hunting Elliot or being hunted by him. On one hand, the thought of Elliot lurking around any corner in my home filled me with an unyielding sense of horror. On the other hand, whenever he was chasing me, I felt genuine terror at what would happen when he tagged me. And one day, my fear was justified.\n\n\u201cElliot!\u201d I screamed.\n\nI was lying on the floor, shivering after my husband had tagged me. But \u2018tagged\u2019 doesn\u2019t begin to cover it. Elliot thumped me in the arm with a cricket bat. Thumped it so hard that I couldn\u2019t move it \u2014 I would later find out that it was broken.\n\n\u201cNew rule,\u201d Elliot said, cracking his neck in a horrid, inhuman way. \u201cEvery tag is more creative than the last.\u201d\n\nShaking uncontrollably, I finally snapped. I\u2019d given the man so many chances, but physical abuse? That was the line. He\u2019d crossed it, and there was no coming back from that. It was finally time to abandon the marriage.\n\n\u201cYou hit me... It\u2019s over,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m moving out. You\u2019re not the man I married. He never would\u2019ve hurt me.\u201d\n\nElliot froze, and something inexplicably horrifying happened \u2014 his eyes blackened. The newly-darkened pupils merged with the whites of his eyes.\n\n\u201cDo you think the game ends if we end?\u201d Elliot asked, sinisterly snickering. \u201cYou\u2019re still It. And if you don\u2019t make an effort\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to you, Elliot?\u201d I wailed, clutching my broken arm and sliding away from the unhinged figure who loomed above me. \u201cWe're not playing Tag anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh? Okay. New rule,\u201d He said. \u201cWhen I next tag you, the game\u2019s over.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo... You can't tag me ever again. I\u2019m It,\u201d I whispered.\n\n\u201cAh, ah, *ah*. Remember the rule. You only stay It if you make an effort,\u201d Elliot gleefully said, striding towards me. \u201cAre you going to make an effort?\u201d\n\nI ran out of the house. Left arm hanging limply by my side, I used my right hand to scoop my phone out of my pocket, and I called my sister from the side of a busy road. She urged me to call the police, but Elliot had fled when officers reached the house.\n\nI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the blackness that spread across his eyes. So, I ended up on an online forum talking about blackened eyes and changed personalities. One user\u2019s comment sent chills through my body:\n\n*He\u2019s got the Blackbug. He\u2019ll only stop playing when one of you dies.*\n\nTerrified beyond words, I decided that it wasn\u2019t safe for me to live with my sister. If the anonymous commenter were correct, then Elliot\u2019s talk about the game being over would surely have spelled my end. I moved to a lakeside cabin under a different name, intending to stay far away from Elliot until I could figure out the next course of action.\n\nI woke at 4am one particularly wintry morning in December. The sound of giggling filled the lakeside cabin, and I trembled. Walking to the edge of the upper balcony, I looked below to see a horrifying sight in the middle of the living room. A head peering over the back of the sofa.\n\n\u201cPeekaboo,\u201d Elliot chortled.\n\nI screamed and hauled my half-frozen body towards the stairs, barrelling towards the front door. But as my hand clutched the handle, something clutched me. I turned to see Elliot on the floor, propped up by hands and legs in a low, crouching position \u2014 the fingers on one of his hands were curled viciously around my ankle. And he was grinning. That awful grin.\n\n\u201cTag,\u201d He whispered. \u201cGame Over.\u201d\n\nHis mouth opened, revealing numerous rows of unnaturally jagged, janky teeth. Poised to pounce, with a vehement look in his eyes, Elliot chuckled again. I screeched, swinging my foot squarely at his jaw.\n\nAs the demonic man recoiled, I fled from the lakeside house and drove far away. That was months ago. I know Elliot\u2019s still out there. The game\u2019s not over. Like the online forum user said:\n\n*He\u2019ll only stop playing when one of you dies.*\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

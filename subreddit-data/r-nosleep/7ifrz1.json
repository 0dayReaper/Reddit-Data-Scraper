    "postText": "This story is a retelling of something that happened to me when I was seven years old. As the years have gone by and I\u2019ve grown up, I\u2019ve realized that the story cannot possibly be true, yet I can\u2019t shake the feeling that it is.\n\nIt happened in Tokyo, in the subway station. I was standing with my father when I saw the demon, a monstrously tall and furry creature with leathery black wings and a snout like an anteater. I must have stared at him for close to ten minutes before he finally spoke, in a soft mutter that was clearly intended for his ears only.\n\n\u201cThis human is creeping me out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt almost looks like it\u2019s looking right at me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am looking right at you,\u201d I said.\n\nThe demon nearly jumped out of his skin. \u201cYou can see me?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYes. Can\u2019t everybody?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot unless they\u2019re in the fifth dimension.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I in the fifth dimension?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYour mind must have slipped over here by mistake. What were you thinking about before you saw me?\u201d\n\nI thought for a moment, and then grinned.\n\n\u201cTrains.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well trains are the link between our dimensions. I guess your mind must have just wandered over here. Either that or you\u2019re going crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope I\u2019m not going crazy,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cBeing crazy is a good thing in the fifth dimension,\u201d the demon replied.\n\nI laughed.\n\n\u201cDo you have subway lines in the fifth dimension?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cHow else would we get to work?\u201d\n\n\u201dYou\u2019ve got wings!\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYes, but who wants to fly? Taking the train is so much faster, and if I fly to work I\u2019m all sweaty when I get there.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what do you use your wings for?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI put them over my head when it rains.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I see?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d the demon said. My hair blew back as he swooped his enormous wings over his head.\n\nI laughed again.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re funny,\u201d I said.\n\nThe demon laughed too, but then his expression changed.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou seem sad.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes.\u201d the demon replied, not looking at me but at something behind me. \u201cSay, would you like to see a magic trick?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nThe demon reached up and tugged a big rainbow handkerchief out of his snout. He must have pulled out twenty feet before he ran out.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny.\u201d I laughed, but I stopped when I realized I wasn\u2019t holding my dad\u2019s hand anymore.\n\nI looked around and saw the subway station had disappeared, replaced by flowing green meadows that were full of old trains.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see the subway station anymore,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d said the demon. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s better to see what isn\u2019t there instead of what is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes when I\u2019m bored or sad, my mind slips off to the third dimension, and I see people like you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d I laughed. \u201cCan you go to other dimensions, too?\u201d\n\nBut the demon didn\u2019t answer, he was looking up at the sky.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s starting to rain,\u201d he said, whooshing his wings up over his head.\n\nWarm droplets of rain hit my face. \n\n\u201cCan I get under your wings with you?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNot now,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go home.\u201d\n\nThe world began to shimmer and flow together like different shades of green and golden paint, spinning around faster and faster in circles. I started to feel a little sick, and I closed my eyes. The world stopped spinning, but warm droplets of water still fell on my face.\n\nI opened my eyes and saw my mom crying over me, but I didn\u2019t see my dad.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s dad?\u201d I asked her. \u201cDid he bring me home?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, darling,\u201d she said, although she didn\u2019t look at me when she said it. \u201cHe brought you home and then he had to go away.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d I replied. \u201cWhen will he be back?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.\n\nMy dad never did come back, and it was years before I found out the truth: he had killed himself that day. That morning he had written a note to my mother explaining that he intended to bring me along and step in front of the train with me. My mother found it when she got home from work and called the police, but it was too late to stop my father. The witnesses say that just before he jumped I pulled away from his hand and ran off, fainting right after. But one of the witnesses, a little boy around my age, said that he saw something take my hand and lead me away from the speeding train.\n\nHe said it was a monstrously tall and furry creature, with leathery black wings and an anteater\u2019s snout.\n\n[x](http://Facebook.com/lifeisstrangemetoo)",

Daim\u014dn most likely came from the Greek verb daiesthai (to divide, distribute).[3] The Greek conception of a daim\u014dn notably appears in the works of Plato, where it describes the divine inspiration of Socrates. To distinguish the classical Greek concept from its later Christian interpretation, the former is anglicized as either daemon or daimon rather than demon.[citation needed] The original Greek word daimon does not carry the negative connotation initially understood by implementation of the Koine \u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (daimonion),[4] and later ascribed to any cognate words sharing the root.\n\nThe Greek terms do not have any connotations of evil or malevolence. In fact, \u03b5\u1f50\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 eudaimonia, (literally good-spiritedness) means happiness. By the early Roman Empire, cult statues were seen, by pagans and their Christian neighbors alike, as inhabited by the numinous presence of the gods: \"Like pagans, Christians still sensed and saw the gods and their power, and as something, they had to assume, lay behind it, by an easy traditional shift of opinion they turned these pagan daimones into malevolent 'demons', the troupe of Satan..... Far into the Byzantine period Christians eyed their cities' old pagan statuary as a seat of the demons' presence. It was no longer beautiful, it was infested.\"[5] The term had first acquired its negative connotations in the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, which drew on the mythology of ancient Semitic religions. This was then inherited by the Koine text of the New Testament. The Western medieval and neo-medieval conception of a demon[6] derives seamlessly from the ambient popular culture of Late Antiquity. The Hellenistic \"daemon\" eventually came to include many Semitic and Near Eastern gods as evaluated by Christianity.\"",

            "comment": "Reminds me of an interesting creepypasta I just listened to. It's called \"The Strangers\" if you want to look it up. The narrator notices a person on the subway who doesn't ever react or even really move and after seeing a few more people like this, becomes obsessed and decides to follow one. I don't want to ruin the story for anyone so I'll stop there, but I recommend it. It doesn't really wrap up the story in a nice way, but it was a well-written and interesting little story if you're into weird stuff. ",

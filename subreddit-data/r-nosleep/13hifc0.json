    "postText": "Someone is behind me right now. I\u2019m fairly certain. No, someone is DEFINITELY behind me. I can feel it.\n\nI daren\u2019t move. Hopefully I\u2019m just being excessively paranoid.\n\nI\u2019ll explain. I have always been planning to go on a vacation to South Korea, as I have been locking myself up due to the pandemic. The government basically forced us to wear this band that tracks you and would alert you if you have left the house. These regulations are finally lifted, and I have been itching to go on a vacation. Yesterday, I finally arrived. I was LITERALLY over the moon. This hotel room is over 1000 square feet, which is way more spacious than my shitty 100 square foot apartment. It was suspiciously cheap though.\n\nI explored the hotel room. There was this small cabinet that was covered in dust. It had a card on it that said \"DO NOT OPEN\". I am a curious person, so naturally I opened the cabinet. It had a rock in it that looked like it was from another planet. I took it out and inspected it. I instantly had a feeling of unease, like I shouldn't have picked it up. I immediately put it back in its original place.\n\nSuddenly, I heard a shuffle. I was instantly on my guard. \u201cOh well, it was probably just the wind,\u201d I thought. Or was it\u2026?\n\nThat night, when I was in the bathroom, I felt like there was someone behind the shower curtains. I felt uneasy. However, I found no one (as expected). I laughed it off.\n\nSomething similar happened to me when I was trying to sleep (I have insomnia). I felt like there was someone standing right next to me, watching me. I got up into a sitting position with a jerk, looking around in fear. This time, I saw a shadow. I was seriously creeped out, but I passed that off as an illusion and drifted off to sleep slowly.\n\nToday, as I was browsing the city, I always felt like there was someone following me, someone that wanted to harm me. Someone whose intentions were malicious. Someone who wanted to kill me. It was seriously unsettling. I wanted to get to the bottom of this and I immediately turned around when I had that feeling of being followed, but I yielded no results.\n\nAs I was having dinner back at the hotel, I had the feeling that someone was behind me again. This time, however, I feel like that person was HOLDING SOMETHING. I turned around and saw the exact same shadow I saw last night, except I saw it for a whole second. I shouted loudly, \u201cWho are you? What do you want? Why the fuck are you following me? I\u2019m seriously creeped out dude, fuck off.\u201d No response. I was starting to question my sanity.\n\nAnd right now, as I\u2019m typing this, I feel it again. Someone\u2019s behind me, and this time I\u2019m certain. It\u2019s getting on my nerves. I'm literally going to shit myself. This person is approaching me slowly, like a predator who is about to catch its prey. Is \"he\" even a person? I\u2019m seriously scared. I can feel that something\u2019s pointed right at me. Probably a gun. It\u2019s getting closer. I am about to have a mental breakdown and cry. I want to scream out loud. I want to call for help, but I know it\u2019s useless. No one is going to be able to help me. It\u2019s too late for that. It\u2019s way too late. I can feel the gun getting pressed painfully upon my neck.\n\nI\u2019m going to die.\n\n[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/someoneisbehindme/comments/13ew9l4/second_storys_out_and_its_based_on_an_experience/)",

They feed off the fear so you have to attempt best you can to show it unconditional love, straight from the heart chakra. I had issues before and they hate this. They feed in our lower 3 chakras and low vibrations such as fear. Can you contact anyone religious there? Speak to someone at the hotel desk and explain? You need help with this especially if you are going to struggle to let go of the fear. Remember, no matter what, on this plane, the living one, we are stronger. We are immortal souls straight from the source itself. We have Christ consciousness. Try calling upon Arch angel Michael or Gabriel and even try Jesus Christ. There seems to be a reason they really fear these names. I learned it myself and gave it a try and it worked. Please though do t just put up with this. Remember your true strength. You are stronger than it you really are. You just have to believe.",

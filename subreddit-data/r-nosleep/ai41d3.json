    "postText": "My mother had the most beautiful teeth.\n\nHer teeth are my first memory. I remember them: long and white and bared in a ferocious grin, shining under the full moon as she told me a story. Not a fairy tale or picture book, but *my* the story. The story of how I\u2019d come to her\u2026or rather, how she\u2019d come to me. \n\nWhen I was very small \u2013 too small to remember anything at all \u2013 my mother stole me from a man, and took me to live in the forest.  She stole me not as an act of love, but as an act of revenge. Though I was desperate to know, she never told me what needed revenging.\n\nOne night, I finally asked, \u201cWhy won\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you are my baby,\u201d she whispered in her low, wet voice. She stroked my face with long fingers. Her teeth glittered under the stars, rich and pale as polished ivory. \u201cMy baby will never hear, or see, or know the cruelties that haunt me.\u201d \n\nCruelty was not the only thing my mother knew that I did not, although it *was* the only thing she refused to teach me. My mother tried very hard to teach me everything else she knew. Unfortunately, I was a very poor pupil indeed.\n\nMy mother was a remarkable huntress. She felled elk and bear effortlessly. Sometimes she slid into the lake without so much as a ripple, and returned hours later with a monstrous fish clamped in her jaws.\n\nBecause hunting came so easily to her, Mother expected me to learn quickly. \u201cMen hunt,\u201d she hissed. \u201cThey have always hunted. So shall you.\u201d\n\nBut I could not hunt. Not like her. My small, soft fingers were no match for her lethal claws. My clumsy little body \u2013 somehow so susceptible to both the heat and the cold \u2013 trailed after her whiplike predator\u2019s form. Mother caught deer and foxes with her beautiful teeth, striking from the shadows like a snake. By contrast, my dull teeth could not even crush rabbit bones.\n\nI persevered, but did not improve. One night, while Mother snaked through the shadows, communing with trees and evading the dark things prowling the night, I curled up and wept. \n\nShe found me that way, weak and weeping. I covered my eyes and held my breath. I knew it was useless \u2013 Mother could hear my heartbeat from the other side of the hill, so she surely knew I was crying \u2013 but that small scrap of pride was all I had.\n\nMother stood there for a long while. Then she crept forward and covered me with fresh leaves before lying beside me. \u201cI will feed you, always,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBecause you are my baby.\u201d\n\nIn addition to hunting, my mother was a phenomenal creator of shelters. Sometimes she lived within the earth, snaking through loam and tree roots like treasure-hoarding dragons of old.\n\nSometimes she lived in the trees. Many nights I watched in awe as her bones elongated and tore through her rough skin, stretching upward to twist among the branches like an ancient spider god. I would wait patiently, sometimes for hours, as Mother communed with the spirits buried in the roots.\n\nAnd sometimes she lived in the shadows, creeping through the darkness to flush out food and threat alike. \n\nSo, Mother tried to teach me to dig burrows. But I could not dig like her. I was too small and too soft, and far too frightened of the bugs and moles that tunneled through the earth.\n\nSo she tried to teach me to live among the tree branches, to rest and listen as the redwoods murmured the long, strange histories of the earth. But my bones could not stretch like Mother\u2019s. I could not twist my arms to match the branches. My skin could not interlock with the treebark, and my blood was too sluggish to melt into the sap.\n\nSo Mother tried to teach me to live in the shadows. But the darkness terrified me. Every night, I hid and wept, imagining the legs of centipedes crawling across my skin. All the night creatures reveled in my fear; owls swooped down to taunt me and bats torpedoed toward me, giggling in their shrill, squeaking voices until mother slapped them out of the sky.\n\nFinally Mother realized the futility of these lessons. So she dug a deep burrow just for me. She lined it with leaves and slurped the worms and roaches from the walls. When she finished, I burst into tears.\n\n\u201cWhy do you weep?\u201d she rasped.\n\n\u201cBecause you do everything for me.\u201d I knew the laws of nature. I knew the laws of forest creatures and their young. Young that were weak were killed in the nest. Young that could not learn to fend for themselves were abandoned to die. I was weak and soft and coated in terrible, ugly scars. \u201cWhy do you do everything for me?\u201d\n\nMother snaked forward, long, large hands sinking into the earth. She curled around me and pulled me close. \u201cBecause you are my baby.\u201d\n\nMother did not always live in the burrow with me. She roamed the mountains. She burrowed with moles, slithered with snakes, grazed with elk, hunted with wolves, stood with trees. \n\nWhen I was very small, I thought she ate the forest. But it was not that simple; she protected it, and in return it sustained her. \u201cMy heart,\u201d she told me one rainy night, \u201cis the forest, so this is how it must be.\u201d\n\nAs I grew older, I developed rudimentary survival skills. I shied away from hunting big game \u2013 elk and deer, bears and boar \u2013 because I did not protect the forest. I gave it nothing; I only took, so I took as little as I could. I trapped rabbits, fished the streams, and ate wild berries. I dared take nothing else.\n\nOnce I could reliably feed myself, Mother stayed away for long stretches. Hours, then days, and finally weeks. I missed her terribly, with a deep, panicky ache.\n\nI confronted her about it one balmy spring evening. \u201cYou leave me more and more,\u201d I accused. \u201cSoon you\u2019ll leave me forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d she murmured. A breeze twined around us, raising gooseflesh on my skin and rippling her long white hair. \u201cI will never leave you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you do!\u201d I screamed. \u201cYou already do!\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore you came, I lived among the trees, listening to their warnings. I slept in the warm earth as worms and centipedes nibbled my skin. I spent many of your lifetimes within the forest, little one \u2013 so many lives at a time that I forgot my own name. I do not leave you. I have left the forest for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come here,\u201d I sobbed. \u201cYou took me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I will never leave you. When you think I\u2019ve left, silence yourself and listen. Listen for me the way I listen for the trees, the animals, and the stars. If you are silent and you are sincere, you will hear me.\u201d\n\nAnd then she left.\n\nFury and jealousy seared my heart like a wildfire. She insulted me, she humiliated me, and after all that she *left* me. Left me for the centipedes and the wolves and the stupid, chittering bats.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need you!\u201d I screamed. An owl hooted angrily in response. \u201cI don\u2019t need you at all!\u201d\n\nThen I ran for my burrow. As it the earthen door materialized before me, nodding with flowers and wild grasses, anger swelled inside me. It possessed me, this wild ball of misery borne of my own endless fear and inadequacy. And it spoke to me.\n*Why should you return to the burrow?* it asked. Why indeed? It wasn\u2019t mine. It was Mother\u2019s. The entire forest belonged to Mother. Without her, the forest would have consumed me long ago.\n\nSo I turned away from the burrow and kept running. *I will find the end of the forest,* I decided. *I will leave it once and for all.*\n\nI ran for days, in the process treating the forest with contempt. I stripped the trees of their leaves to make nightly beds. I threw rocks at birds and rabbits. I uprooted bushes and stripped entire groves of their berries, eating until I threw up from sheer excess. Then I ate again. Not out of hunger, not out of any need, but out of malice.\n\nAnd one day \u2013 long after spring ceded to summer in a verdant explosion of heat and greenery \u2013 I heard voices.\n\nI froze immediately. The only voice I knew was Mother\u2019s \u2013 wet and low, an earthy, rib-shaking whisper. These voices were nothing like Mother\u2019s. They were high and somehow infantile, with strange, shrill notes.\n\nThese voices\u2026they were like *mine.*\n\nTrembling, I dropped low and crept through the underbrush. Sun-warmed leaves brushed against my face, smooth but painfully crisp; the sun was taking its toll on them. I snaked over the ground, pretending I was Mother, slipping through the forest like an invisible snake.\n\nI reached a break in the trees and peered through.\n\nIn a small clearing were four creatures. They had pink skin and wore heavy clothing that looked suffocating. There hands were small and soft. Their faces were smooth and babylike, somehow half-formed: wide eyed and rounded, with soft noses and plump flesh.\n\nI touched my face \u2013 flat and smooth - and looked down at myself: mudstreaked, deeply tanned, and marked with a hideous mass of scars, but still *soft.* Hairless, small, weak. There was no mistaking it. These things in the woods \u2013 these overdressed, half-formed beings with small teeth and no claws and overlarge eyes \u2013 were like me.\n\nThey were men.\n\nI stood up, propelled by panicky excitement, and strode forward. All at once, they froze.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d one whispered. He lifted something in his arms and pointed it at me. It was long and strange to me. Inorganic, not alive, with a wooden handle and a gleaming tube.\n\nJust then, I realized something: the forest was silent. A few birds chirped and sang, and a few bugs emitted their persistent drone. But the vast majority \u2013 birds, insects, trees \u2013 were silent. No rabbits, no deer, certainly no bears. These things \u2013 these creatures like me, these *men* - had silenced the earth.\n\nThey\u2019d stolen the forest from itself. \n\nWe stared at each other for a long time as ever-growing summer heat filled the clearing like an invisible pool.\n\n\u201cMother,\u201d I whispered. \u201cMother, please help me.\u201d\n\nShe did not. So I turned and ran.\n\nThe men immediately pursued. I could hear them: yelling, crushing the undergrowth, stamping on blossoms and bugs, snapping branches as they ran. The forest\u2019s deathly silence was worse than any cry.\n\n\u201cThere it is!\u201d one of them screamed. A second later, the forest exploded: a deafening *boom* shook the trees and ate through the air as pain erupted on my shoulder. I didn\u2019t dare stop or look. I pressed on, running and crying as the men came after me.\n\nThe forest seemed to punish me for my earlier cruelty. Brambles scratched my legs. Stones cut my feet. Branches swiped at my face, leaving deep, stinging runnels. I thanked the forest for its kindness. I thanked it for punishing me, rather than stopping me. \n\nThe men gasped and wailed amongst themselves. \u201cWhat the hell is it?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. *I don\u2019t know!*\u201d \u201cIs it a\u2026a kid?\u201d \u201cLook at its face. Look at its fucking face! That isn\u2019t a kid!\u201d\n\nSomething suddenly filled my ears, drowning the sounds of the men and the forest. A deep, musical rushing, like birdsong transformed into a turbulent river.\n\nAnd then Mother came, erupting from the trees like a great beast of old. But that\u2019s what she was, after all. A great beast, surely a daemon of the ancient world.\n\nShe pounced upon the men, batting them the way a housecat bats its toys. She clamped one between her claws, squeezing until his head separated and went rolling across the ground.\n\nOne by one Mother caught and tore them, shredding them the way she shredded leaves for my bedding. Blood streaked the forest, turning the dirt to mud and dripping from the trees like sluggish rain. \n\nMother dug her claws into the skull of the last survivor and cracked it open like a fruit. Blood and grey brain glistened in the sunlight. The man screamed, and screamed, and screamed.\n\nMother leaned down and extended her tongue. It curled outward, pale and orange-gold like sunrise on a cold, clear morning, and delicately slurped his brains. Curl by curl, like so many worms from my burrow walls.\n\nBy the time he stopped screaming, the forest had returned to its loud, familiar glory: murmuring trees, singing birds, skittering insects, grazing deer. \n\nI smiled and ran to Mother. She reared up and screamed, \u201c*See what you\u2019ve done!*\u201d\n\nTerror paralyzed me. I looked helplessly at her \u2013 blazing eyes, contorted face runneled with earth and wildflowers, sunbleached bone and pale, spongy rot. My mother, my beautiful daemon mother who claimed me out of revenge and raised me out of obligation, staring at me like I was a man.\n\n\u201cWhen you stone a bird, my heart stops! When you break a branch, my bones snap! When you selfishly strip the shrubs of their fruit, of their very birthright, my skin blisters! When you hurt the forest,\u201d she roared, \u201c*my heart bleeds!*\u201d\n\nI fell to my knees and hid my face. Mother rushed forward on her many limbs and wrapped long fingers around my throat. She lifted me up, dangling me over the forest floor. \u201cI killed men for you! Now more will come! They will trample! They will cut! They will burn! They will kill! They will kill the bears and the cougars and the wolves, for they will blame the predators for what I have done for you! Do you see?\u201d She shook me. The carnage below seemed to swing beneath me, a tapestry of blood-soaked earth and ruined corpses. \u201c*Do you see?*\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Mother,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\nShe dropped me. I hit the ground with such force it knocked the wind out of me. Mother pulled back and busied herself with one of the corpses. I looked up, shaking. Birds watched from the trees, quick and curious and full of condemnation. I averted my eyes as tears spilled.\n\nMother returned to me. She extended an arm and opened her hand. Upon her large palm were four eyes and a large, glistening heart. I stared at them blankly, then looked up at her.\n\n\u201cFour eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cOne from each man. And the heart of the one that shot you. Eat.\u201d\n\nMy lip quivered. I couldn\u2019t tear my eyes away from the gore in my mother\u2019s hand. A heart and eyes. Raw and plump, alive just minutes ago.\n\n\u201cMother,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you of me?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr are you of man?\u201d\n\nThe forest became painfully silent. The animals, the trees, and the insects, all waiting with bated breath.\n\n\u201cI am of you, Mother.\u201d I plucked the first eye from her palm. It was round and curiously firm, with a sort of firm, watery texture I associated with half-rotten fruits. The pink, wormy optic nerve dangled. For a terrible moment I thought I would vomit.\n\nThen I raised it to my lips and bit in.\n\nThe eyes were awful, the heart even worse: thick and almost impossible to chew. Mother had to tear it for me, slicing it into manageable pieces with her beautiful teeth. \n\nWhen I finished, Mother picked me up and, holding me tightly, streaked back to the burrow as night fell.\n\nThat night, I became ill. I shook and shivered and hallucinated for days. My mind bled with images of dangling eyes and glistening hearts and skulls cracked apart like pomegranates. Mother lay with my all the while, soothing me with ancient songs like birdsong turned to rivers, and cooling me with her damp, earthy breath.\n\nFinally the fever broke. I sat up, gasping as the last vestiges of my nightmare drifted away.\n\nMother sat across the burrow, hunched over tiredly. \u201cYou are well,\u201d she said. \u201cI am glad, for I must leave.\u201d\n\nI blinked tiredly. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cMen,\u201d she said. \n\n\u201cBut you killed them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are more,\u201d she said. \u201cThey creep into the forest, searching for their dead brethren. They are cutting the trees and crushing the flowers and killing the bears, my little one. If I don\u2019t stop them, they will even come for you. I have to stop them. My heart is the forest, and so are you. I must protect both.\u201d\n\nA lump rose in my throat. Shame like I\u2019d never known enveloped me. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are my baby. Babies must learn. By learning, they grow.\u201d\n\n\u201cMother,\u201d I said. \u201cAm I truly of man?\u201d\n\nMother closed her eyes. For a long time, she did not speak. Then she drew a deep breath. \u201cI took you from a cruel man. Listen. I will tell you now of the cruelties I endured.\u201d\n\nI listened, enraptured and horrified, as she spun her sorry tale.\n\nMother was once a young, beautiful human woman.\n\n\u201cSurely not more beautiful than you are now,\u201d I objected.\n\n\u201cListen!\u201d she said.\n\nMother was alone in the world. She had no family or friends. She once had a family, but they harmed her greatly so she ran away. She lived in the forest, in a small, ragged tent. She ate wild berries, fished the lake, and boiled water to drink.\n\nLaws are strange things. Though Mother hurt nothing and no one, she was breaking the law by living in the forest. She was found, and caught, and imprisoned. Separated from the trees and the birds, Mother faded quickly. Though she was only jailed for a short while, it nearly killed her. The day she was released was the best day of her life\u2026\n\nOr so she thought.\n\nNo sooner had Mother gathered her meager belongings and exited the jail than a guard came up beside her. \u201cWhere are you headed to?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ll take you wherever you want to go.\u201d\n\nMother was ecstatic. \u201cTake me back to the forest,\u201d she said. The guard obliged, driving her toward the woods. Except he stopped too soon. He stopped at a house. His house, it turned out.\n\nThe guard was a terrible man. He trapped Mother. He hurt her, tortured her, abused her in every way. He cut her open, he burned her, he snapped her bones. \n\nAnd he put a baby in her. Mother was so broken that he missed all signs of impending childbirth. When I came, Mother died.\n\n\u201cHe dumped me in a vat of acid,\u201d Mother told me, \u201cand scattered my liquid remains among the trees. But then I heard you.\u201d Mother smiled faintly. Crumbles of dirt and root fell from her face. \u201cI heard your cry. Your need for me.\u201d\n\nI do not understand what Mother said next; it is difficult to translate. But the closest I can come is this. Everyone sings a song to those they love. Most aren\u2019t able to hear these songs. If you can\u2019t hear, it can\u2019t help you. But if you can hear it, a song is the most powerful thing in the world. It kills. It calls. It consumes. It destroys. It strengthens.\n\nAnd sometimes, it resurrects.\n\n\u201cWhen I reformed and breathed again, I stole you from your father,\u201d Mother said. \u201cThen I brought you here, because you are my baby.\u201d\n\nI wept silently, because I didn\u2019t know what to say.\n\n\u201cI must go,\u201d she said. \u201cThe trees and the animals need me now. So remember, little one. When you are silent and you are sincere, you will hear me.\u201d\n\nThen she whipped around \u2013 like a wolf, a snake, and hawk combined \u2013 and left.\n\nShe did not return.\n\nAt first, I thought nothing of it. I had made a terrible mess; I had summoned men. I had caused the forest to bleed. Mother had a great deal of work ahead of her.\n\nBut summer slowly bled into fall, and still Mother did not return. When the first snow came \u2013 dry and cold, skittering across the landscape like powder \u2013 I knew something was wrong.\n\nThe snows deepened. The forest drifted into its winter sleep, cloaked in ice and fog. Every night, I made myself silent. I mustered all the sincerity I could. And I listened for my mother\u2019s voice.\n\nIt didn\u2019t come.\n\nI grew thin and sick. My skin burned even as I shivered. My chest grew congested, my throat so sore I couldn\u2019t sleep. My breath came in sharp, pained wheezes.  Soon I became too weak to leave the burrow. I crawled to the doorway and ate snow. For sustenance, I slurped worms from the earthen walls. \n\nIt was not enough, and I knew it.\n\nOnly then \u2013 in the quiet and peace and fear of approaching death \u2013 did I become truly silent. Only then did I hear the voice of my mother.\n\nI heard her in my dreams: the low, rushing voice like music made into water. *I am coming,* she said. *I am coming, because you are my baby.*\n\nI smiled, and slept. \n\nNext thing I knew, I was cold. Cold and wet and shivering, but *awake.*I shot up and screamed as my skin brushed the thick, flower-matted hide of my mother. I spun around, smiling, and froze.\n\nMother lay beside me, panting. Blood seeped from a hundred wounds, crusting her hair. The exposed bones in her face were crushed and concave, leaking gore and blood. Without opening her eyes, she smiled. \u201cI heard you. I heard your song.\u201d\n\nTears blurred my vision. My chest began to hitch. I couldn\u2019t draw breath; it was like I was sick again, drowning in pus and trapped fluid. Only I wasn\u2019t dying this time.\n\nMy mother was.\n\n\u201cThen stay,\u201d I said. \u201cYou have to stay, because you can hear my song.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou needed to see me again. But you do not need me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you. Mama, *I need you.*\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI killed all who would harm you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what about the forest? The forest will kill me without you!\u201d\n\nShe chuckled. Her breath came, terribly fast and increasingly weak. \u201cYou are of me. Remember. You are of me. You are my baby.\u201d\n\nMy mother \u2013 my beautiful, ancient mother \u2013 drew a shallow breath, and lay still.\n\nI lay beside her for many days. Then, when she began to stink, I left. A hiker eventually found me. A stupid, solitary hiker with a soft heart, a great deal of patience, and no fear.\n\nWhen I learned to speak the words of men, the authorities lost no time in telling me that Mother was not really my mother. \n\nThey discovered my identity (at least in a manner of speaking) through DNA. My real mother, they say, was a vagrant. A Jane Doe who lived in a tent in the national park. She was alone and defenseless, two things that attract human monsters. After a brief stint in jail for loitering, my mother ended up kidnapped, imprisoned, and tortured by an as-yet unidentified assailant who eventually tried unsuccessfully to dissolve her in acid. They think he attempted to dissolve my body, too. That\u2019s why I am covered in scars. It is why I frightened those hunters so long ago: the acid burns make me look like a monster to men.\n\nSince my real mother apparently died long ago, they decided that Mother \u2013 whoever she was \u2013 was nothing but a crazy, homeless child abuser.\n\nBut I know better.\n\nEven so, I adapted. I had no choice. I am of my mother, but I live among men. That\u2019s what animals must do; their young learn, grow, and adapt. If they don\u2019t, they die. \n\nBut I am not adapting anymore. At least, I am not adapting to live among men. My mouth is changing. Changing in ways that are terrible to people, but wonderful to me. It\u2019s my teeth, you see.\n\nI am growing my mother\u2019s beautiful teeth.\n\nLooking at my teeth in the mirror was frightening and electrifying. Joy and terror ran through my veins in equal measure. It had to mean something. So I fell silent. I became sincere. I listened.\n\nAnd I heard.\n\nI heard the voice of my mother: low and rushing, like birdsong turned to a wild river. She tells me I do not belong with men, because I am her heart, and her heart is the forest. She tells me I must return.\n\nAnd she tells me she is waiting for me, because I am her baby.\n",

Two weeks before my mother passed away, my kitten died, eventjo the vet said he\u2019d live.... \n\nTwo months prior to that, my 6 year old cat was rushed to the ER at 2am. They found a rare throat tumor. They asked me to donate his body for research. \n\nTwo weeks prior to Spartacus passing, my 9 year old boxer died of cancer. \n\nAnd two months before that my mothers mother passed away. \n\nI lost my entire immediate family besides my husband and two children and my kittens mother. \n\nI haven\u2019t been on Reddit since my boxer started to get sick last June (she passed July 2nd)\n\nThis is the first time I\u2019ve been on nosleep since returning to social media. (I sorted and this was one of the top rated stories this year). And I held back tears the entire time I read this. Mother\u2019s Day is in two days. I will be thinking of you and all the other children who recently lost their mother like us. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. It\u2019s ... so hard. I keep wondering when the grief and shock and daze and disbelief and disconnection from reality will go away and it hasn\u2019t still 6 months later. \n\nLove to you my friend. I hope you\u2019re in a good place now - this post is rather old - I wish you the best.",

It's hard to process thoughts of yearning and wishing she was here because in my whole 24 years, I have never had to do that, you know? \n\nI'll be honest, I've been trying to subtly ignore the fact that Mother's Day is coming up. Thank you for reminding me that there are others like us as I have become somewhat bitter. I will definitely use that day to think of and extend love to others like us. \n\nI sincerely hope all is well with you as well. I'm surprisingly better than before and am in a good place. Much much love to you. I will definitely keep you in my thoughts this Mother's Day. Please make sure to keep yourself well with self care and all that makes you happy. \u2764",

Saving me with her soft hands and glimpse of her wild hair, to stop me from stepping out onto a path where a car was going far faster than they should have been in a pedestrian filled area. Comforting me, stroking my hair whilst I screamed and cried on the couch after working a week long domestic abuse campaign, and the memories I had been shoving away the whole week finally consumed me. I can still hear her soft, raspy voice. \"You did good baby, it's okay. It's okay baby. You did so good.\"\n\nI miss her, but while I can't see her, or touch her with my hands, I know she's always there. ",

She can\u2019t survive off insects, she can\u2019t kill animals with her teeth and hands, she can\u2019t merge with the trees and earth like her mother can.\n\nThe girl then runs away after her mother leaves her alone, and stumbles on some hunters, who mistake her for a monster due to her scars, leading them to attempt to kill her.\n\nMother then kills the hunters to protect the girl, however because of this, more people will show up to try and destroy the forest in an attempt to kill whatever killed the hunters.\n\nMother fends off everyone that comes, however is mortally wounded, making it back to her daughter only to die. Her body begins to rot, and the daughter leaves the forest, only to be found by a hiker, who recognised her as human. The police check her DNA to find her mother was an unnamed vagrant who was kidnapped, raped, and murdered, and say that \u2018Mother\u2019 was just a crazy child abductor.\n\nThe ending tells us that the girl is changing to be more like Mother, with her teeth forming sharp points, suggesting she is to be the next forest guardian.",

There are a few ways to interpret it (although they might all just make it more confusing, and if so I apologize): the proverbial \"soul of the forest\" avenged the mother and allowed her to live on as a guardian by absorbing her essence and blending it with that of the forest; or the spirit/being had the opportunity to take several forms through the course of her existence, and met a violent and unfortunate end in her most recent human life before returning to the forest; or she's straight-up an eldritch-style entity who kind of absorbs the collective knowledge and memory of everything that lives and dies in the forest, which gives her the ability to kind of switch between the consciousness and experiences of all these life forms at will, one of which is the human mother; or she's both the ultimate embodiment and protector of the forest and all the life within - in other words, the mother of the forest - and because the forest effectively swallowed the remains of the human woman, she is simultaneously human mother and forest goddess. In each scenario, the mortality she chose by staying human enough to parent her son is what caused her to die.\n\nOh boy, this all came out more convoluted than I thought XD I hope it cleared things up at least a little. If not, I'm sorry! It all made more sense in my head haha.",

    "postText": "I recently accepted a job as the new sheriff in a small town called Hollow's End, making me the only law enforcement officer within a hundred miles.  As it turns out, this decision may have been a huge mistake.  \n\nNormally a job like this in a little town with a couple thousand residents would mean a pretty boring and mundane existence.  I\u2019ve worked in a few different small towns over the years and I was expecting this to be more or less the same.  \n\nAt first it appeared that mundane was exactly what I would see.  Besides a few speeding tickets, I didn\u2019t run into any real trouble.  There was Randy, the town drunk, who often slept in the police station's only jail cell.  I picked him up on a nightly basis for starting fights or disturbing the peace, vandalizing businesses or screaming bloody murder while walking the streets.  He was typically alone in that cell (which he often called his apartment) although there was room for ten or more in the big cage.  Every so often he'd end up sharing it with someone who had been unfortunate enough to cross his path, and lacked the common sense to avoid him.\n\nThe town had your typical problems with shoplifting teens and the odd disputes between neighbors and spouses.  But for the most part it was peaceful and quiet, and the jail cell remained empty, aside from Randy.  \n\nIt seemed that most people in Hollow's End resolved their differences privately, without resorting to calling 9-1-1.\n\nBut I've come to realize something since starting as the new Sheriff in Hollow\u2019s End.  Despite the similarities to other places I've been, this town is not like other towns.  \n\nThere\u2019s something very weird about this place, and I can\u2019t put my finger on what it is.  The residents have been welcoming and friendly, don't get me wrong, but at times I feel like an absolute outsider.  Like there's some secret I'm not privy to. \n\nDuring town hall meetings, for instance.  I\u2019ll make suggestions or ask questions and everyone goes quiet - like they\u2019re in on some big mystery that I don\u2019t know about.  People whisper and shoot glances in my direction, then go quiet when I look their way.   \n\nI know, this must sound paranoid to an outsider.  But that\u2019s what I feel like I am here - an outsider.  \n\nAnyways, I thought getting some other people\u2019s perspectives might help.  Maybe you can see what I'm missing here.  And maybe you can help me figure out what's really going on in this place.\n\nToday started out like any ordinary day.  I was sitting at my desk in the bullpen of the police station, doing a crossword puzzle and listening to the baseball game on the radio, waiting for some action.  Like I said, not much happens in Hollow\u2019s End - but my experience told me that some people would be out raising hell on a warm day like this one.  There were sure to be a few drunk and disorderly calls and maybe even a DUI or two.  \n\nRandy, the town drunk, was locked up in his cell as usual, snoring away.  I\u2019d picked him up in the wee hours of the morning and he had ranted at me for a while before passing out.  It had been more than eight hours now and I was planning on waking him up soon to kick him out, starting our daily routine all over again, when the red phone rang.  \n\nThere was a dispatcher who put the calls through to this phone, and if it didn\u2019t pick up after three or four rings it flipped over to my cell phone.  I nabbed it just in time before it switched over.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d I said into the receiver.  \u201cThis is the Sheriff.  What\u2019s your emergency?\u201d \n\n\u201cWill you shoot that fucking rooster already!!!?\u201d Randy screamed from his cell, so loud I couldn\u2019t hear the person on the other end of the line.  After this outburst he promptly began snoring again.\n\n\u201cSorry, can you repeat that?\u201d I asked.    \n\n\u201cUmmm, hi,\u201d a timid voice on the other end said.  \u201cIs this the police?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, this is Sheriff Parsons.  What\u2019s your emergency?\u201d\n\nThe woman sounded confused, as if she still did not realize who she was calling or why. \n\n\u201cHi, yeah.  Um, I\u2019m sorry, maybe I shouldn\u2019t have called.\u201d\n\nShe was about to hang up and I pleaded for her to stop.  \n\n\u201cHey,\u201d I said.  \u201cIf it's an emergency, then you dialed the right number.  What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\nThe woman hesitated and sounded uncertain, but I tried to convince her to trust me.\n\n\"Listen, I might sound annoyed, but that\u2019s just because you interrupted me in the middle of my crossword puzzle.  And Randy's really getting on my last nerve.  But I\u2019m actually pretty anxious to get out of the station.  I can come by and talk if you want to explain in person.  Whatever it is, maybe I can help.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d she said finally.  \u201cI\u2019ll give you my address.\u201d\n\nI hung up the phone and immediately filled a nearby bucket with cold water from the bathroom sink.  It would only take a minute, and whatever the woman was calling about didn\u2019t sound that urgent. \n\nI really didn\u2019t want to leave Randy alone in the police station.  He was good with picking locks and who knew what sort of hell he would raise if left alone in the bullpen.  He\u2019d gotten out of that cell more than once - and I had no idea how he did it.  This way was just easier.  \n\n\u201cWake-up time, Randy,\u201d I said, opening the cell door, freezing-cold bucket of water in hand.  \u201cWhat were you saying about a rooster?  Because I actually need to replace mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cTen more minutes,\u201d he yelled angrily.  Then he opened one eye and saw the familiar bucket of water in my hand and shot to his feet.  \u201cY\u2019know, on second thought, I\u2019m good.  I\u2019ve learned my lesson.  Can I go now?\u201d\n\n*\n\nSeveral minutes later I pulled up in front of the house.  A young, pretty, brown haired woman stood at the front door, holding it open.  She held up her hand and waved at me timidly.  \n\nI walked up the driveway and stood on the front porch, introducing myself to her as kindly as I could.  \n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re the Sheriff.  You're new to Hollow\u2019s End as well?\u201d \n\nI nodded.  \n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been here for just a few weeks.  It\u2019s nice.  People have been very welcoming.  Mostly.  When did you move in?\u201d\n\n\"Last Summer,\" she answered.\n\nHer lip trembled and there were tears in her eyes as she tried to speak, but her words caught in her throat.  \n\n\u201cWhoa, hey what\u2019s wrong?  Are you alright?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my husband,\u201d she said.  \u201cHe didn\u2019t come home from work last night and he isn't picking up his phone.  This isn\u2019t like him to be gone for so long without calling.  I don\u2019t understand what happened to him.  I don't know if maybe they did something to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cSlow down,\u201d I said, pulling out my notepad.  \u201cWhat WHO did to him?  Is there someone out there who has it out for your husband for some reason?\u201d\n\nShe shook her head, clutching herself and looking past me with nervous eyes.  \n\nHer neighbors were just getting home, getting out of their car with a load of groceries in their arms.  \n\n\"Hey, Christine,\" the man called over to her.  \"Everything alright?\" \n\n\u201cGreat!\u201d she called back, with a fake smile plastered across her face.  \n\n\u201cMiss?  What\u2019s going on,\u201d I asked, confused.  \u201cDo you think they might know something?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.  Maybe.  I don\u2019t know.  Listen, the only one in town who we trusted was the old sheriff, and he\u2019s\u2026 Well, you know.  And now I don\u2019t know who to believe.  This place\u2026  We had no idea when we moved here what it was like.  Did you?\"\n\nI shook my head slowly, trying to figure this woman out.\n\n\"You\u2019ll see.  Everyone who lives here finds out soon enough.  For us it was the garden.  We thought we knew better, but we found out quickly enough that you have to follow the rules in this town.  And one of the rules is, don\u2019t talk to outsiders.  I\u2019m sorry, but I think that\u2019s still what you are.  An outsider.\u201d\n\nI opened my mouth to say something but she was already retreating back inside.  \n\n\u201cWho is the old sheriff?\u201d I managed to get out.  \n\nThe door was almost all the way closed, but then she paused and opened it up again.  Just wide enough for her to say one name.  \n\nAnd it was the last name in the world that I would have expected.  \n\n*\n\nOf course the one time I actually needed to find Randy he was gone.  The man was constantly raising hell, and residents of Hollow\u2019s End were always calling me to complain about him.  But now that I needed to speak to him everyone was going radio-silent.  \n\nFurther proof of THE CONSPIRACY, a paranoid voice in my mind said, but I inwardly silenced it.\n\nI drove around town in my beat-up old cruiser, trying to spot Randy in one of his usual haunts.  \n\nHe wasn\u2019t sleeping in the ditch in front of the liquor store.  He wasn\u2019t in the forest in the fort he had built out of fallen tree branches.  He wasn\u2019t in the washroom at the gas station.  And when I went to the playground and looked at the monkey bars there was no sign of him there either.\n\nIt was like he had completely disappeared from the face of the earth.  \n\nI was about to give up looking for the time being when I finally spotted him, walking along the shoulder of the road up ahead.  The man had long, scruffy hair down to his shoulders, an untrimmed beard which was brown with dirt, and he wore a duster jacket, carrying a backpack with him at all times.  His cold, blue eyes had always looked intelligent to me, and I had thought ever since I met him that he was smarter than he let on.  Even if he was also completely and utterly insane. \n\nI pulled the car over and got out, but he kept walking straight past, ignoring me.  \n\n\u201cRandy,\u201d I called after him.  \u201cHey, buddy.  I need to talk to you about something.\u201d\n\nHe pretended he didn't hear me, continuing to march forwards.  \n\n\u201cHey man, I\u2019m sorry about the bucket.  It\u2019s just\u2026 you\u2019re like Houdini.  I can\u2019t leave you alone in that cell.  You get out every time.  And it's really hard to wake you up without it.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t say a word.  So I just kept talking.  \n\n\u201cFine.  I get it.  You have every right to be pissed off.  Maybe I should just consider changing the locks.  Something tells me the old sheriff might still have a copy of the key to that prison cell.\u201d\n\nThat finally got to him.  \n\nRandy stopped walking mid-stride and turned to face me, a little grin playing at the corner of his mouth.  \n\n\"I have no idea what you're referring to.\u201d\n\nI clicked my tongue, giving him my best attempt at a disappointed, fatherly look.\n\n\"Guess I'll just have to arrest you again and search your bag until I find those keys.  Maybe I'll check a few other places too, if they're not in there.\"\n\n\"Arrest me for what!?\" he yelled indignantly.\n\n\"For being a pain in my ass,\" I answered back.  \n\nReally I just needed to talk to him.  I had no intention of arresting him.\n\nI heard a noise over my shoulder and turned to look, but there was nothing there except my cop car, and the rear view mirror a little ways back, showing a reflection of us.  When I looked at Randy again he was pale as a sheet, and looked like he'd seen a ghost.  \n\nHe stuck out his wrists, asking me to cuff him.  \n\n\u201cJust do it.  I\u2019d rather be in there anyways.  Especially at night.  It isn\u2019t safe out here, man.\u201d\n\nRandy had always said these sorts of things, but now I was starting to take him a bit more seriously for some reason.  \n\nI put the cuffs on him, but just for appearances.  There were a few people watching from the windows of nearby stores and houses.  There were always people watching in Hollow\u2019s End.  Always that feeling of eyes on the back of your neck.  \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not under arrest,\u201d I said quietly.  \u201cI just want it to look like you are.  I need to talk to you.\u201d\n\n*\n\nI drove us back to the station and tried to interrogate Randy along the way, but he promptly fell asleep and started snoring the moment the car began to roll.  I had forgotten that was one of his quirks - Randy was a narcoleptic whose spontaneous sleeping fits were often brought on by driving.  He was like an infant, soothed by the motion and lulled to sleep.  \n\nWhen we got back to the station I looked in the mirror and noticed he was gone.  \n\nFeeling even more confused than usual, I opened the back seat to look at the place where he had been sitting.  \n\nRandy had disappeared, leaving the handcuffs behind.  \n\nOf course there was no way out of the back of the police cruiser without the doors being opened from the outside.  But that hadn't stopped Randy.  \n\nNothing could stop Randy.\n\nAnd the sonofabitch still had the spare key to the jail cell.  And who knew what else he'd pilfered from the station after quitting or getting fired or whatever the hell had happened.  \n\nAnnoyed, I got back into the driver's seat and decided to go out for a patrol to clear my head.  Driving always helped me think.  I managed to find a picture of the missing man from Nightsoil Avenue by pulling up his driver's license through the patrol car's onboard computer system.  It was the one and only modern piece of technology in the ancient vehicle, and worked reasonably well.  \n\nDespite looking for several hours all throughout the town, I didn't see the man anywhere.  Through some detective work, though, I managed to find out his employer's name.  He had recently started working for J&amp;M Delivery Co. - a local takeout food and liquor delivery business in Hollow's End.  I resolved to go speak with the owners after a quick pit stop at the police station. \n\nI went inside and was somewhat unsurprised to find Randy was already in his cell with the door locked, inexplicably drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee from a mug I'd never seen before, which said \"#1 Sheriff\" on the front of it.  \n\nWhile this WAS very irritating, it was also the best news I'd seen since finding out the \"dad bod\" was back in style.\n\nSitting down at my desk, I tried to think about how to approach this situation.  I needed this man's help.  But he was clearly insane, and also possessed some sort of Houdini-level magical prowess. \n\nHis alcoholism was another concern.  He was typically blackout drunk at this hour of the day, and it was barely 5PM.\n\n\"Get talking, Sheriff,\" he said suddenly.  \"It's almost noon and I haven't had a peep all day.  If you don't want me to start rantin' and raving, you better get to the point.\"\n\nI let this sink in for a few moments, ignored the urge to check my wristwatch, then asked him a question I'd never asked him before.\n\n\"Why DO you drink, Randy?  What exactly is it inside of you that you need to drown with booze every day?  And what happens if you don't?\"\n\n\"You've seen it, Sheriff,\u201d he muttered back at me.  \u201cYou've seen the broken windows on Main Street.  If I don't drink, those fucking faces show up in the glass every time.  They're waiting for me, if I forget to drown their voices I'll hear them screaming.  And you don't want to hear the screams of monsters, Sheriff.  Trust me, there ain't nothin' in the wild world more terrifying than the screams of your nightmares.  Just pray you never hear 'em.  But I think you will.  Nah, scratch that.  I know you will.  And then you'll be joining me in this cell, drinking right along with me.  And they'll have a new sheriff in town.  Every week a new sheriff\u2026\" \n\nHe was rambling and I tried to cut him off but he was gone now.  There was no way to get through to him except by doing the unthinkable.  \n\nBut luckily I'd gotten pretty good at doing unthinkable things.\n\nI went into my desk and pulled out my trusty bottle of scotch, and hated myself as I poured him a tall glass of the stuff.  \n\n*\n\nOnce Randy was good and drunk, he began to spill the beans.  \n\nAnd what a story it was.  Completely unbelievable, of course.  The drunken ravings of a lunatic.  But the tale terrified me nonetheless.  \n\n\"So this is why you drink?  This is why you smash people's windows and run around screaming in the middle of the night, saying things are chasing you?\"\n\nHe nodded.  \n\n\"You really expect me to believe this?\"\n\nHe nodded again.  \n\n\"But if you get drunk you don't see them?\"\n\nHe continued nodding as I left the bullpen to go use the toilet.  \n\n\"You're an idiot,\" I said on my way out.  \n\n\"You'll see,\" he said back to me.  \u201cProbably any minute.\u201d\n\n*\n\nI got to the bathroom and did my business, then began to wash my hands in the sink.  Scrubbing them with soap and hot water until they stung.  Standing there in the quiet bathroom, all alone, I suddenly felt more scared than I had ever felt in my life.  \n\nOut of my peripheral vision I saw a dark shape in the mirrored surface of the glass in front of me.  It was too close to be my reflection, too sinister and dark.  It was moving on its own, and not matching me at all.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to look up.  But I found myself doing it anyway.  My heart hammering, I looked into the glass and saw a face that was not my own.\n\nThere was someone else staring back at me from the glass.  Her face was inches away, looking ready to jump out at me.  \n\nIt was a woman.  Her skin looked like she had been poisoned.  Her eyes had dark rings around them and her veins stood out prominently, inky black in color.  Her flesh was sweaty porcelain, her gaze vacant, as if she didn\u2019t notice me at first.  \n\nBut then her eyes caught mine and it was like a veil had been lifted between us, and she took me in, her rotten smile growing wider and wider.  Black teeth were revealed, and between them where her gums should have been there were a million spiders, crawling outwards, seeking the light, trying to get out.  Trying to get at me.  Skittering and crawling across her skin, moving down her arms and tracing a path toward me. \n\nMore arachnids began to pour out of her hair and out of her eyes as she held back laughter, holding up her hands to bridge the gap between worlds.  Reaching out to touch the glass, it shimmered and turned to water for a second, before changing back to glass again.    \n\nWasting no more time, I punched the mirror with my fist, shattering the glass, thankful that my hand didn\u2019t go right through and into that other world.\n\nThe pain was exquisite, the blood dripping immediately from the wound and running down my arm, soaking it and staining my uniform with red.  \n\nShards of broken glass could be seen embedded between my knuckles, sprinkled across my skin and driven deep into the flesh in places.  Jagged bits of broken glass hung suspended in front of me, some still stuck to the wood where they had once been attached.  Pieces fell into the sink, ringing against the porcelain, and I tried not to look into those bloody, shattered reflections for too long.  \n\nI felt no pain, though.  My heartbeat was still a pounding drum of pure adrenaline, numbing me completely from the agony that I wouldn\u2019t feel until later.  \n\nThe only sensation coursing through me at that moment was pure fear.  Terror as I began to consider how many windows, how many mirrors, and how many pieces of glass I walked past each and every day.  What if every one of them suddenly contained a monster, ready to leap out at me the moment I made the mistake of looking at it?  \n\nI stumbled out from the bathroom and Randy saw my bloody hand immediately.  He stood up and moved closer to me in the cage so he could examine me better.\n\n\"You saw them, didn't you?\" he asked.  \"Yeah you did.  I told you those fuckers were real.  Oh, and I forgot to mention this curse is contagious, so it spreads to anyone you spend too much time with.  Now, get your ass in here and have a drink with me.  I promise it will help.  See, I knew we were gonna be friends.  Nothing says martyrdom like a five dollar bottle of scotch.  We can be Joans of Arcs together!\"\n\nI was too stunned to respond.  All I could think to do was follow Dr. Randy\u2019s recommendation: Take a few drinks and try to drown out the demons.  \n\nHe knew this world better than I did, after all.  As much as I thought I had everything figured out, it turns out I didn't know shit about the world, and I didn\u2019t know fuck-all about Hollow\u2019s End.  \n\nTaking another glass from the desk, I wiped the cobwebs and dead spiders out of it (trying not to think about the mirror) and poured myself a glass of the cheap scotch and another, smaller one for Randy.  \n\n\"Okay,\" I said, sitting down across from him in the cage.  \"I was wrong.  Dead wrong.  About everything.  Now, can you please tell me what the fuck is going on in this town?\"\n\nRandy smiled and began to speak.  \n\nYou can't talk to outsiders about what happens in Hollow's End, but I'm not an outsider anymore.  \n\nLove it or hate it, I'm a part of this place now.  \n\nAnd it's a part of [me..](https://www.reddit.com/r/JGcreepypastas/comments/13t7ywp/theres_a_new_sheriff_in_hollows_end_cake_day/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13w3m69/im_the_new_sheriff_in_hollows_end_people_in_town/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[YT](https://youtu.be/rumiJJyA2FM)\n\n[TCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)",

There's clearly some weird shit going on there but it still doesn't explain how Randy managed to disappear from your cruiser and end up in the station inside of his cell. I think not only does he know more about what's going on in this town, but he also has some secrets about himself that he's hiding. Be wary of him, it may seem like you can trust him right now but you never know",

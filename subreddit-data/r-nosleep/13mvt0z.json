    "postText": "\rStudying abroad alone could be tough. Even without considering the difficulty of the course itself, my study in the US has been quite challenging, especially in the financial aspect. Everything here was so expensive compared to back home. I felt upset every time I did my monthly budgeting. Housing, food, tuition, and transportation, they all added up to a frightening amount.\r  \n\r  \nSo, I started taking a part-time job.\r  \n\r  \nIt was a medium-sized Thai restaurant just about fifteen minutes from my dormitory. All the employees there were all Thai, and they immediately hired me as a waitress for a simple reason - being able to speak both Thai and English decently. Although I was the youngest there, I fit in easily, and everyone welcomed me as the \u2018little sister\u2019 of the team. It was one of those rare occurrences where when the management claimed that they \u2018work together like a family,\u2019 they really meant it. The loneliness of being in a vastly different cultural environment bonded us, and we always looked out for one another.\r  \n\r  \nOverall, it was a really good workplace. The pay was not bad, and I also got paid extra with some free Thai meal every shift. The food was far from authentic (my mom would faint if she saw the chef put broccolis and carrots into green curry), but the part where we crowded into the kitchen and chit-chatted over a hot meal together before the shift started was what I looked forward to the most each day. It was a little wholesome moment that reminded me of my family back home.\r  \n\r  \nThere was one extra task that I needed to do each day before the meal, though.\r  \n\r  \nOn the far corner of the restaurant was an old wooden shelf holding a small doll of a boy wearing a traditional Thai costume, this deity was called Kuman Thong. The word Kuman Thong meant a golden boy. The practice of adopting Kuman Thong was a very old belief dating back hundreds of years, and somehow it still survived until today. Ask any Thai person you know about this, and you might hear an interesting anecdote.\r  \n\r  \nKuman Thong\u2019s origin was quite morbid, as expected. In the past, dead foetuses of children who died while still in their mothers\u2019 womb were roasted and dried by a practitioner of black magic to create a Kuman Thong. Through a specific ritual, the spirit of the stillborn babies would be invoked to possess these dried corpses. The owner could then adopt them and worship them, feeding them food like a real child.\r  \n\r  \nObviously you couldn\u2019t use stillborns to create Kuman Thong now, so people opted to use dolls instead. Still creepy, but it definitely resulted in less grave-robbing if I had to guess.\r  \n\r  \nPeople believed that the Kuman Thong would bring luck and prosperity to any household that took good care of it. My grandmother also adopted one at her home in Bangkok; she had always had it ever since she moved there sixty years ago. One of the stories she would tell me all the time when I was young was about the one time she forgot to turn off the stove before going to bed. She told me that she had a bizarre dream that night where she saw a small child dressed in traditional Thai outfit running in her house, giggling like he was trying to show her something. She felt like someone was pulling her leg, then woke up to the smell of a burning kitchen. Luckily, she was able to put out the fire very quickly, and until today, she still believed that the Kuman Thong came to warn her about the fire in her dream.\r  \n\r  \nNoi, the owner of the restaurant must have held the same strong belief as my grandmother. I had never met her, but our manager told us that she was quite superstitious. Apparently, she came to the US with almost nothing but somehow managed to buy the restaurant at a very favourable price. Not only that, a famous food blogger came in a few years ago and left a good review, resulting in the business picking up very quickly. Noi credited all these lucky events to the power of the Kuman Thong. Therefore, it was crucial for her that we treated the Kuman Thong with utmost respect. We had to treat it like a real child.\r  \n\r  \nI was never the person who would believe in these supernatural deities. But in Thai, we had a phrase saying \u2018if you don\u2019t believe in it, don\u2019t disrespect it.\u2019 That phrase was something I lived by all my life, so when the manager asked me to take a small plate of food to the Kuman Thong, I complied.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cKuman Thong, the dinner is ready. Please enjoy.\u201d I murmured to the doll as I placed the tray of food and a glass of red Fanta on the shrine. Yes, red Fanta. As absurd as it may sound, Kuman Thong\u2019s choice of drink was apparently strawberry soda. People used to offer the Kuman Thong blood in the past, but not anymore. It was a common agreement that since the red Fanta and blood were both red, they should be an acceptable substitute.\r  \n\r  \nIt was just a normal day for me. I completed my daily ritual of offering food to the Kuman Thong and went about my day, getting ready for the restaurant to open at six. It had been raining all afternoon without a sign of stopping, so I expected it to be one of those slower days.\r  \n\r  \nAround fifteen minutes to six, the first customer showed up. They were a family of three consisting of a father in his late thirties, a tired-looking mother, and a young son dangling in her arms. The child was about three or four, which was the worst age to be out in a public place. Most of the time, they were not old enough to learn to behave properly in public, but they were not young enough to be confined to the child seat for the entirety of the meal either. I glanced at my manager, Namwan, who returned me a look that said, \u2018go deal with them, please.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u201cGood evening, sir. I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be opening until six.\u201d I said politely.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe understand, but can we just wait here? I have a reservation at six under Jim. We planned to go to the park before coming here, but you know\u2026,\u201d the father gestured to the pouring rain outside. \u201cSo we are a little early.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOf course.\u201d I led him and his family to the reserved table, right under the Kuman Thong\u2019s shrine. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know when we\u2019re ready to take your order. Would you like some drinks meanwhile?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYes, just water,\u201d the father said.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDaddy, can I have a coke?\u201d the boy asked as his mother placed him on a chair.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cFine. Water and a can of coke then,\u201d the father gave in.\r  \n\r  \nThe kitchen was already busy even though no order had come in yet. The chef was thawing the meat and cutting vegetables, while the kitchen hands were busy preparing spring rolls fillings. I squeezed past them to the fridge where we kept all soft drinks. There were some iced tea and lemonade soda, but no coke.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAre we out of coke, P\u2019Namwan?\u201d I asked the restaurant\u2019s manager, who was wrapping spring rolls nearby.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI told you to refill it last night, didn\u2019t I, Lek!\u201d Namwan shouted at one of the kitchen hands.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSis I\u2019m so sorry, but I forgot!\u201d he shouted back.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThis guy!\u201d Namwan sighed deeply and then turned to me. \u201cFah, can you please go buy some from the grocery store near the bus stop? Just take the money from the cash register.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI didn\u2019t want to go outside in this weather, but someone had to do it, and it was better if I did it before more customers arrived. Since everyone else was busy, I decided to take one for the team. I grabbed the umbrella and started walking.\r  \n\r  \nThe store was just two blocks away, but it took me almost twenty minutes to return. I bought two packs, which turned out to be heavier than I had anticipated, especially while trying to balance them with one hand while holding the umbrella with the other. Despite my best efforts, my apron was soaked and I couldn\u2019t stop trembling. This chilly weather was something a person from a tropical country like me could never get used to.\r  \n\r  \nBy the time I came back, the restaurant had become much more packed. A big family arrived without a reservation, and Namwan was busy rearranging tables and chairs to accommodate them. I quickly changed my apron, grabbed a can of coke, and walked over to the first family.\r  \n\r  \nThe mother and father were engrossed in a conversation about politics and weren\u2019t paying attention to their son. The boy had climbed onto his chair to the Kuman Thong\u2019s shrine, and to my horror, he was drinking from the glass of red Fanta meant as an offering. Noi would be furious if she saw that.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOh, no. I\u2019m so sorry but please don\u2019t drink from that.\u201d I tried to stop the boy, but I hesitated to touch other people\u2019s children without permission. The father eventually broke away from his conversation and looked at his son with an annoyed expression.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cJacob, get down from there,\u201d he commanded.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cBut I am thirsty!\u201d the boy whined. \u201cWhere\u2019s my coke?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s right here. I\u2019m sorry it took a while,\u201d I apologised.\r  \n\r  \nI took their order, but before I left, I decided to remove the food tray from the Kuman Thong\u2019s shrine as well. Less than half of the soda remained in the glass. Jacob had also eaten the small fish cake and rice that were offered to the Kuman Thong. Although I didn\u2019t believe in the Kuman Thong, I still thought it was quite disrespectful for his parents to let him do that. I brought the tray back to the kitchen.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThe kid at table 14 ate the offering,\u201d I told my manager. \u201cShould I refill them?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat kind of parents let their child eat from a random shelf?\u201d Namwan complained as she handed the long list of orders to the chef. \u201cYeah, we should refill that. But first, Fah, we need 12 extra champagne glasses for table 2. There are some in the dishwasher but probably not enough. I\u2019ll look for some more in the storage room\u2026\u201d\r  \n\r  \nMore customers kept coming in, and I was so busy I forgot to refill the offering. An hour or so passed, and I was helping a customer with his receipt when Jacob\u2019s mother approached me at the counter with a hysterical expression on her face.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMy son is missing!\u201d She screamed. \u201cI-I took him to the bathroom, and I got distracted from a call. He didn\u2019t come out, so I went in to check, b-but he wasn\u2019t there!\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThis was definitely something above my paygrade. I called Namwan over, and she consoled the panicking mother while sending some of us to look for the boy around the restaurant area. I was sent out to the balcony. The rain had not stopped, and the wind was blowing cold droplets of rain into my face. I started shivering almost immediately.\r  \n\r  \nOur restaurant was on the second floor of a four-storey building. The storage room and the bathroom were only accessible through the long balcony outside. A flight of stairs led down from the balcony to the parking lot. I saw Jacob\u2019s father walking around in the rain, calling out to his son. His yelling was swallowed by the sound of the heavy rain. There were many cars parked there, but there was no sign of any other human. \r  \n\r  \nI went into the bathroom, just to be sure. Obviously, it was empty. According to Jacob\u2019s mother, she was waiting for him in front of the bathroom, so there was no way she wouldn\u2019t have seen him leaving. Jacob might be able to fit into the small window if he tried, but I doubted he could reach it. \r  \n\r  \nAs I was about to leave, I heard a faint giggle.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cJacob? Come on out, your parents are looking for you,\u201d I said, turning around. Nobody was there; I must have confused the sound of the rain for a child\u2019s giggle.\r  \n\r  \nFor the storage room, it was harder to tell if someone was there at the first glance. We didn\u2019t clean it as often as we should, so it was all dusty and full of junk. Employees\u2019 lockers were located on one side, several boxes of unopened dry ingredients on the other. Broken chairs and tables were stacked near the corner of the room, with cleaning supplies scattered all over. There was only a single lightbulb in there, and it was not very bright.\r  \n\r  \nAt first glance, there was no one there.\r  \n\r  \nThen I heard it again.\r  \n\r  \nIt was the sound of a child laughing, and this time, I was sure of it. The giggling sound was soft and belonged to a boy around Jacob\u2019s age. I was very spooked by this point.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cJ-Jacob? Are you there?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHe\u2019s not here! Just me!\u201d a boy\u2019s voice replied, and I froze.\r  \n\r  \nHe replied to me, in Thai.\r  \n\r  \nSuddenly, my eyes caught a movement in the dark corner of the room. I believed I saw a small head, covered with black hair in a traditional Thai top knot, moving into the shadow and disappearing. Remembering how Jacob was blonde, I screamed and slammed the door closed, hitting my back against the balcony\u2019s railing as I backpedalled the hell out of there.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I returned to the restaurant, Jacob\u2019s father was back from his futile search. He was soaked wet and defeated. Jacob\u2019s mother was crying hysterically. The police arrived shortly after that. From their whispers, it seemed they were considering Jacob\u2019s disappearance as a kidnapping case. I gulped and turned to Namwan, who was biting her nails anxiously.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cP\u2019Namwan, umm\u2026 does any one of us bring a child here?\u201d I asked.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Namwan asked. \u201cNone of us have any kids. And even if we do, P\u2019Noi would never allow us to bring them here.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI-I see,\u201d I murmured.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDid you see something, Fah?\u201d she asked, suddenly becoming attentive. \u201cYou should tell the police if you saw anything strange.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I saw what I think I saw.\u201d I glanced at the Kuman Thong doll on the shelf. Namwan followed my gaze and gasped quietly. She then disappeared into the kitchen and came out with a refilled glass of red Fanta and a plate of food.\r  \n\r  \nThe police watched in confusion as Namwan brought the plate to the Kuman Thong shrine, but she didn\u2019t seem to care. She pressed her hands together and started to pray in silence. As I watched her, I also called out to the Kuman Thong in my mind and asked him to help find the missing child.\r  \n\r  \nNot even ten minutes had passed when one of the policemen ran into the restaurant.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe found him!\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWe could not believe our eyes as another policeman walked in with Jacob cuddled in his arms. I didn\u2019t get a good look at him because he was quickly carried away to the ambulance, with his parents rushing behind. We all had a big collective sigh of relief, but then the policemen started to look very serious.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe found him in one of the bathroom stalls. Apparently, he never left,\u201d the policeman said. \u201cYou guys did check the bathroom right?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cCountless times!\u201d Namwan insisted. \u201cBoth his parents went in to look for him, almost all of our employees went in. Even one of you guys went in when you first arrived, remember?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThis is really strange.\u201d The policeman scratched his head. \u201cHow did none of us see him during the two hours he was missing?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHe must have been playing with Kuman Thong. Perhaps the Kuman Thong didn\u2019t want his playtime to be over yet\u2026\u201d one of the kitchen hands murmured. Namwan turned to glare at him. After all, she didn\u2019t want them to think we were a bunch of superstitious crazy people.\r  \n\r  \nAlthough it was still unexplainable at the time, the police accepted their win and left. My life resumed its normal routine. We never saw Jacob\u2019s family again, which was understandable. I wouldn\u2019t want to come back either if I were them. I still thought about them and the weird encounter in the storage room from time to time, and I brought it up with Namwan one day.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cActually, a policeman dropped by a week after that,\u201d Namwan said. \u201cYou weren\u2019t here since it was not your shift. He came to ask if we had seen any suspicious individuals that day. They suspected that something emotionally traumatic happened to that kid.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhy did they think so?\u201d I asked.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cBecause the boy wouldn\u2019t speak to anyone after the whole ordeal. His parents said it was like he was a different person. When he finally talked, he spoke in a language they didn\u2019t understand. His diet also changed; he wouldn\u2019t eat anything except pig blood curd. They were pretty spooked and concerned, it seemed,\u201d Namwan handed me the tray. \u201cAnyway, take this to the Kuman Thong, will you?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI looked at the tray. The glass was filled with coke this time, and the food offering was not Thai food, but a small portion of mac and cheese and two pieces of chicken nuggets.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMac and cheese?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nNamwan shrugged nervously. \u201cWell, I just think that, maybe he might prefer this\u2026\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWe never heard from Jacob\u2019s family again. Noi still refused to move the shrine from its original place. Therefore, we just tried to avoid seating families with young children near the Kuman Thong\u2019s shrine nowadays.\r  \n\r  \nIf you\u2019re reading this, please make sure to remind your children to behave when out in public, especially when you visit a Thai restaurant.\r  \n\r  \nOtherwise, the child you take back home might not really be [yours](https://www.reddit.com/r/idontlikepapaya/comments/136ahik/welcome_to_ridontlikepapaya/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).",

Things got so bad he was unable to sleep because he was often hearing the sound of running children's footsteps and sinister giggling in his hallway at night. He knows a great deal of ritual purifications.

She said that shadows were clinging to all corners, even when all the lights were on. She said it's by far the creepiest thing she'd ever experienced. \n\nThe practitioner friend finally swallowed his pride and reached out to every exorcist he knew.

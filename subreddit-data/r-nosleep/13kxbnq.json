    "postText": "\nWhen I was eight years old, my little brother Dylan went missing.  He was four at the time, and he\u2019d been out in the fenced in backyard one minute and gone the next.  Everyone went crazy looking for him, of course.  Sheriff\u2019s office, police, my parents, friends and neighbors.  At first everyone said that we\u2019d find him within the first day, though even at eight I could hear the kind lie in their voice.  There was no sign of a gate being left open or a gap in the fence large enough for him to squeeze through.  Which meant that someone had snatched him, and unless we got an idea of who or they contacted us\u2026well, how were we ever going to get him back?\n\nBy the third day the talk had turned from finding him to waiting for a call from whoever took him.  That and advertising every way my parents could think of to get his name and picture out to as many people as possible.  They pushed the news stations to cover it morning, noon, and night, and for a week or so they did.  But as more time passed and new stories came in, the daily reminder to call if you saw him got pushed to the back of the hour and then it was gone.  \n\nMy parents weren\u2019t dumb and knew this would happen, of course.  They took out t.v. ads and put stuff out on the internet, though back then the web was not as big and popular as it is now, and the television ads were expensive.  Fortunately, my mother\u2019s business was a local print shop, and she wasted no time in printing up thousands of flyers that we posted all over our part of the state.\n\nFor the next year, that was our routine.  Every weekend and some weekdays after work and school, we would load up and put up flyers in new areas and replace those that time and weather had eaten away.  All of them were the same:  The words \u201cHave you seen me?\u201d followed by a recent picture of Dylan and the final line of \u201cPlease call\u201d and then my mother\u2019s cell phone number.  We spent so many hours in the car with stacks of those flyers, it felt like Dylan\u2019s ghost was haunting us through the whispered rustle of reams of paper, each of them a frozen reminder of Dylan\u2019s face staring out at us, asking why we wouldn\u2019t help him come home.\n\nBy the time I was eleven, my parents had divorced.  My father had hung into the crusade to find their son for the first year, but when year three was getting close, he finally had enough.  They argued and fought for a couple of weeks and then he packed up and moved across town.  Within the year he\u2019d taken a job in another state and I mainly saw him at Christmas for a day or two after that.\n\nI wanted to hate him, and I guess in my way I did, but not because he\u2019d left.  Because he\u2019d left me behind.  My mother had become so focused and passionate about finding Dylan that everything else fell by the wayside, and even after any reasonable hope was lost, she didn\u2019t slow down.  \n\nI know from the outside that might sound like a good thing\u2014like she was being a good and dedicated parent trying to find her child.  But it was more than that.  I didn\u2019t know the analogy then, but looking back when I got older, I likened it to a soldier who can\u2019t be comfortable in a life without war after so long on the battlefield.  It was like she needed it to continue\u2014not just searching for him and putting up the flyers, but being seen doing it.  Talking to people about it.  Getting their sympathy and compliments and well-wishes.  The grieving, heroic mother had become her entire persona, and over time I came to understand she didn\u2019t know how to let it go.\n\nStill, over time it let go of her.  Life moves on.  People forget, and old tragedies are replaced by new ones.  I remember how angry my mother was when a little girl went missing my first year of high school.  Even when the girl was found two days later, she would stalk around the house muttering and in a foul mood.  If you asked her, she\u2019d say it was because it would make people forget about our Dylan even more.  But I remember feeling uneasy when she\u2019d say that because\u2026well\u2026I could hear the lie in her voice too.\n\nAs I\u2019d gotten older, I\u2019d done what I could to avoid her ongoing campaign.  I\u2019d have to help some weekends still, but for the most part I made sure that I had enough extracurricular activities to keep me out of her way.  I think she actually preferred that.  It was easier to play on people\u2019s sympathy and get attention when she could tell everyone she didn\u2019t have anyone to help her keep searching for her missing son.\n\nStill, I could tell something was coming.  Like pressure building in the atmosphere before a storm, something was going to break soon.  My hope was that she\u2019d reach the point where she\u2019d give up on finding Dylan and just live her life again, both for her and for me.\n\nInstead, one day she woke me up around four in the morning and told me we had to go.  She was clearly distraught\u2014sweating and crying and barely able to talk, I didn\u2019t know what was going on.  Had she found out something about Dylan?  Had something happened to Dad?  What was it?\n\nShe just waved away my questions and told me to come get in the car.  That we had to go now.  That she\u2019d explain when there was time.\n\nI did as I was told, though by this point I was fully awake and growing increasingly terrified.  When she got behind the wheel, I half-expected her to peel out of the driveway and shoot off at top speed, but she didn\u2019t.  Instead, she drove slowly and quietly, not even turning on her headlights until we were out of the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cMom, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\nShe glanced over at me, sweat still pouring down her cheeks.  \u201cIt\u2026it\u2019ll be okay.  Just wait.  We\u2019re g-going to make it right.\u201d\n\nI turned and stared out at the passing dark.  \u201cIs it Daddy?  Is he okay?\u201d\n\nMy mother gave a harsh laugh.  \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s fine.  Living it up with his whore girlfriend, I\u2019m sure.\u201d  She put a hand on her other arm and rubbed it as she gave me a sour look.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry about him.\u201d\n\nI wanted to respond, but didn\u2019t quite dare.  She was more crazy acting than usual, and I didn\u2019t know what might make it worse.  So I just sat silent for the next few minutes, wondering more and more where we were going in the middle of the night.\n\nWhen the car suddenly veered off the road into the ditch, I had a moment of unreality where I felt like *I* was the thing sliding away from the path, not the entire vehicle.  Then there was a bang as we hit the bottom of the ditch and began to roll, glass shattering and metal squealing as we tumbled twice and came to rest.\n\nMy mother was dead before the ambulance got her to the hospital.  Not from the accident\u2014surprisingly enough, we weren\u2019t badly hurt from that.  No, I found out later she\u2019d had a heart attack\u2014that was the reason for the accident and why they called her death as soon as they checked her in at the ER.  People talked to me about it after I was checked out\u2014a nurse and a highway patrolman originally and then my father when he came to get me and carry me back with him.  I always told them what I remembered happening, and they\u2019d look puzzled but say very little else.  The prevailing theory was that she\u2019d known she was having a heart attack and was trying to get to the hospital when she wrecked.  I asked my father once why, if that was true, we wrecked heading the opposite direction from the closest hospital.  He\u2019d looked uncomfortable and said he didn\u2019t know.  Maybe she was in pain and confused.  That it was better for me not to dwell on it.\n\nHealthy or not, I actually took his advice.  I tried to not question it, and over the next few years, it began to fade for me too.  It wasn\u2019t until I was eighteen that I was forced to face it again.  My father sat me down and told me that, now that I was of age, I had inherited everything my mother had left behind.  There was some money, yes, but also the house and everything in it.  He told me he\u2019d be happy to help any way I needed, and that there was no rush on it\u2014he\u2019d been making sure the taxes and insurance were paid on the house and the business, and the person running the print shop was interested in buying it if I wanted to sell it to them.  \n\nIt was a lot to take in all at once.  I\u2019d asked about the house and business before, and I knew that they were going to be mine, but I\u2019d never thought much about the details beyond that my father was dealing with it.  At first I wanted to just push it all away\u2014I didn\u2019t want the past infecting the new life I had here with new friends and better memories.  The more I thought about it though\u2026I didn\u2019t want to hide from it.  Hiding from things, being afraid of things, that\u2019s how they came to own you.  I\u2019d seen enough of that to know I didn\u2019t want to spend another minute with my past life owning me.\n\nSo the next week I flew back to my old hometown.  My dad offered to come, but I told him no.  Partly because I knew she wouldn\u2019t have wanted him there, but mostly because I needed to do this myself.  I\u2019d look at everything, spend a couple of days there, and then sell anything I didn\u2019t want and never look back.\n\nIt was hard at first, but by the second day I was tired enough of going through boxes and drawers that the fatigue and monotony drowned out most of the weird sadness I felt.  I\u2019d been dreading the attic from the start\u2014it had been my mother\u2019s overflow junk storage, and there was no telling what all was up there.  Running out of reasons not to do it, that afternoon I pulled down the stairs and headed up to see what was waiting for me.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t as bad as I\u2019d expected.  A few small tables and chairs sat piled up in one corner, and there were a couple of moth-eaten rugs and piles of curtains sloppily wadded up against one wall, but otherwise there were just a few boxes and a couple of old trunks, sitting crouched in the shadows like a pair of leather-bound coffins.\n\nOpening the first one, my stomach dropped.  It was full of Dylan\u2019s stuff\u2014some of his baby clothes, pictures of him, a little cub scout outfit he loved to wear even though he wasn\u2019t old enough to be a real scout yet.  Sniffling, I shut the trunk back and turned to the other one.  For the first time since coming back, I felt tears coming.  He really had been a great little boy.  Who the fuck would\u2026\n\n\u2026lock this trunk?\n\nThe second trunk had a small padlock on it, and I had no idea why or where the key was.  After looking around for a minute for any sign of a key stashed away nearby, I went downstairs and got a knife and a pair of pliers.  I didn\u2019t break the lock, but I did pry at the latch holding it hard enough that it finally popped off and skittered away into a darkened corner of the attic.  Grasping the trunk lid, I realized I was holding my breath.  It would be fine.  Just more sad stuff maybe, but probably just cluttered with old junk.  What else could it\u2026\n\nI froze as I stared into the trunk.  What\u2026that didn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nThe inside wasn\u2019t cluttered or messy at all.  Instead it was neatly arranged into six columns of stacked colored paper.  *Chartreuse Number 2* my brain whispered to me.  I knew the shade because Mom had always told me how important the color was for Dylan\u2019s flyers.  You had to catch the eye without obscuring the details\u2014the words and the picture were key.\n\nThe ones in the trunk were much as I remembered.  Not just the same yellow, but the same words too.  \u201cHave you seen me?\u201d and \u201cPlease call\u201d followed by my mother\u2019s cell phone number.  In truth, I could only see one difference between the flyers I\u2019d grown up with and the ones I was staring out now, heart beating out of my chest.  It wasn\u2019t Dylan\u2019s sad ghost face staring up out of that trunk.\n\nIt was mine.\n\nI remembered the picture.  I had been getting dressed up to go to an athletic awards banquet for girls\u2019 basketball when my mother came in with her camera.  She wasn\u2019t going to the banquet, of course\u2014she had flyers to put out two counties up and was already running late, but before my friend and her mother got there to pick me up, could she just take a couple of pictures.  I just looked so pretty and she was so proud of having such a pretty girl.\n\nI\u2019d tried to resist.  I was running behind and she was acting weirder than usual, and I really just wanted her to go on and go before my normal friend and her normal mother got there.  But then she got that tight, almost angry but not quite angry look she sometimes got, and I knew it was better to give in.  Putting on my earrings, I followed her outside and posed next to the backyard fence.  Once she snapped a few pictures, she seemed satisfied and headed out the door.\n\nI thought it was all strange at the time, but then everything was strange back then.  And to be fair, I didn\u2019t really have that long to ponder it.  Because the following week she woke me up in the dead of night and said I had to come with her.  That we were going to \u201cmake it right\u201d.\n\nI understood now what she had meant, and what she had meant to do.  Seeing that picture of a past me, staring up from a week before I went out with her into the dark, I wish I could tell her to not stand there, but to run.  To run away from the thing she was living with.  Because if she stayed, one night she\u2019d be drug out into the black, and only one of them would be coming back.\n\nI closed the lid on the trunk with a shaky hand.  *At least it was me.*  And that was true, but somehow that didn\u2019t make any of it better.  \n\nI locked the front door without taking anything with me other than what I\u2019d brought.  There was nothing there I wanted to ever see or touch again, though I was old enough by then to understand it wasn\u2019t a one-way street.\n\nYou don\u2019t just own your memories and your truths.  They own you too.  And even when you try to forget them and leave them behind, they never stop searching for you.  [All you can do is be ready, and when they find you, turn away from the beckoning hand reaching out of the dark.](https://redd.it/9ndww5)",

For instance, a mom I know with a very sick newborn (who is now seven years old and no longer ill) still refers to herself as an \u201c[Illness] Mom.\u201d It\u2019s her entire personality, social media presence, everything, and it\u2019s not like she\u2019s active in fundraising or research.

Therefore, I've decided to relay another one of my earlier experiences which may seem counterproductive I know, but at least it's a breath of fresh air compared to what I've been steeped in for over a year now. This particular experience took place a few months after we dealt with the vampires. Quick aside from that, there has been some progress with Chaviva. While a cure still hasn't been developed, they have managed to help her with behavior therapy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's able to resist the urge to bite someone's throat long enough to hold a conversation. Her family is even able to talk with her occasionally. The same can't be said of the vampire that bit her. Anyway, it was my first day back in school and for me, it was in a new school. As I mentioned in my first post, Dean's line of work required us to move frequently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUsually, we didn't stay anywhere longer than a year, sometimes, not even six months. While I wouldn't call this an ideal environment for social growth, I did manage to make some friends and keep them in my contacts. One, Sheila would text me during the morning. It was a couple minutes before the bell when I felt my phone vibrate. Taking it out of my pocket showed me a text notification.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Help,\" it read.\n\n\"What is it?\" I typed back.\n\n\"Wilson.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was both her homeroom and math teacher. Based on what she told me, he was also incredibly strict and would assign homework every chance he got. The first day of school was no exception.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Sounds rough. Wish I could help, but class is about to start.\"\n\n\"Okay, see you later.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI set my phone to vibrate and put my phone away. A quick aside, I was a gifted student with straight A's attending school. I'm not trying to brag, quite the contrary. Something I learned early was that as talent increases so does the amount of work someone must do. Thanks to mentoring by Dean and others I was already well into academics prior to enrolling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn fact, the only reason I attended was that Dean legally couldn\u2019t leave me home alone. It was a way to kill time while he was off doing missions he thought were too dangerous for me. There was some talk about putting me in a private school. However, he didn\u2019t see the point in having that paid for when according to him, the truly important things are learned outside of class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cHey.\u201d someone whispered from my left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was my first time meeting another close friend of mine. He introduced himself as Brice and I told him my name.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cDo you like Dragon Ball too?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d\n\nHe pointed to my wallet sticking from my pocket which had super saiyan two Gohan on it.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, do you like it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHell yeah. I\u2019ve seen every episode. Have you watched the original?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe teacher walked in, cutting our conversation short. As it turned out, Brice and I shared several classes together.  Over the next week, we talked more and more. Soon, I was talking to him almost as much as I did with Sheila. I told him about her as we were waiting to get picked up on Thursday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cI think you and her would get along. She likes a lot fo the stuff we do,\u201d I told him.\n\n\u201cShe sounds pretty cool. Too bad she\u2019s so far away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe Skype sometimes. I could see about letting you on one of our calls.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you can sure, I\u2019d love to. Hey, why don\u2019t we hang out sometime?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile Dean did encourage me to make friends, with our living circumstances things were complicated.  I couldn\u2019t have anyone over due to some things we kept at home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cAt your place?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, what do you say tomorrow or Saturday?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I just need to check with Dean.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis car pulled up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cSee you tomorrow,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Brice replied, giving me a wave.\n\nWhen we pulled out of the parking lot, Dean went on a rant.\n\n\u201cMan, people have been up my ass all day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know where to start to answer that. First off, I got a flat on the way in. You\u2019d think our people wouldn\u2019t be slower than AAA, but apparently not. Secondly, the coffee machine broke and there was almost a breach which tops it all off with me having to spend most of the day on edge that something is going to break out. Anyway, how was your day?\u201d\n\n\u201cBrice wants to hang out.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes he? We\u2019ll have to see about that then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I was wondering if maybe he could come over.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDean shot me a brief glance and focused his vision back on the road.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI just wish we didn\u2019t have to keep all these secrets.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone has at least one. Just give it time. When you\u2019re older you won\u2019t be as restricted with this kind of thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no. Can I at least go over to his place tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat depends.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn what?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDean gave me a deadpan stare. A  sliver of apprehension grew within me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"It's time for my second mission. Isn't it?\"\n\n\"Bingo.\"\n\n\"Great, so what is it this time? Ghosts? Werewolves?\"\n\n\"An exorcism.\"\n\n\u201cThat was going to be my third guess. I take it we\u2019re in for another long trip?\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, not that long. Where we\u2019re needed is only a few hours away. With luck, we should be through and home by midnight. I already have the supplies we need in the trunk so we\u2019re all good to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI better text Brice.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI let him know something came up and that tomorrow might work, but nothing was guaranteed. He replied back that it was fine and that he\u2019d catch me later. During the ride, I inquired to Dean about the exorcism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cSo, how exactly do we know if one is real? I mean, couldn\u2019t it just be mental issues or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain criteria they have to meet. Obviously, if it can be explained by conventional wisdom it\u2019s best left to medical or mental health  professionals.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if it can\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where we come in. The signs of a legitimate possession revolve around drastic shifts in the behavior of the victim and unexplainable phenomena occurring around them. Say, somehow a door closes on its own and locks itself or something along those lines.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI nodded in understanding, then decided to pull out a book from my backpack to keep myself occupied. This time it was The Exorcist novel. While it did manage to get some things right, it was still far off the mark when it came to real exorcisms.  As an aside, it\u2019s been a while since I had the time to sit down and get lost in a story. I keep finding my mind getting pulled back to my work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s made it difficult to enjoy leisurely activities. Hopefully, I can get back to them someday. That\u2019s not important right now, though. Getting back to my second mission, the home we arrived at belonged to a higher-class family. It\u2019s more common with richer people since they can afford access to places where that sort of risk is greater or to buy objects with a similar property. I imagine warnings of curses tend to go ignored because the wealthy tend to think they are invulnerable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt least that\u2019s one advantage the poor have. We pulled up to a gate and Dean hit the intercom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe voice was shaky which made me nervous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the ones sent to deal with the Bairds\u201d  problem.\u201d\n\nThe gate opened and we proceeded. We parked near the driveway.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going in to assess the situation. You open the trunk and I\u2019ll be out to let you know exactly what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe took the keys out of the ignition and handed them to me. We got out and he headed to the front door while I went to the trunk. In it were several different religious texts and corresponding items, varying bottles of different colored liquids and powders,  and clear crystals. These were all in separate bags.  I took them out and closed the trunk. I figured Dean might be a while so I decided to check my phone and saw another text from Sheila.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Hey, you busy right now?\u201d\n\n\u201cKind of, but I can talk for a bit. I was meaning to talk to you about something.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her about Brice and how I thought they\u2019d get along.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cHe sounds cool. Does he have a number?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI texted it to her and she thanked me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cZane.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked up, seeing Dean with a grim expression. Right away, I knew that this was going to be more trouble than we intended. Putting my phone away, I asked how bad it was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cFucking bad, this might be the worst one I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe l ran his fingers through the back of his hair, and let out a breath. I wasn\u2019t even in the house yet and already I wanted to hop back in the car, speed away, and never look back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cIs there anything we can do then?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWe can try. First, there are some things you need to know before we go in. There are different kinds of possession.\"\n\n\"So not just demons or ghosts?\"\n\n\"No, I mean there are. Those aren't the only kinds, though.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe elaborated further. There are standard possessions where people are taken over by weak entities, be they demons or some other spirit such as a deceased soul or even something believed to be in folklore. These are the easiest to deal with. It gets harder when you have to combat the stronger ones. The reason is that they tend to have dedicated followers who are actively nourishing them through sacrifices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFortunately, they don\u2019t have too many so while difficult to banish, it isn\u2019t impossible. The same can\u2019t be said for this last kind. These are ones with a lot of name recognition and in fact, some aren't even native to Earth or known by anyone on this planet. Attempting to get them out of someone is like trying to scoop water out of a boat as more keeps trying to fill it. The short of all this is the hardest cases of this to face are ones where the entity is new to us and they have a lot of followers in places we can't contact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"And it's the last kind in that house as we speak,\" Dean said, pointing to it. \"The worst part is that  they lied about how long this has been going on.\"\n\n\"Does that matter?\"\n\n\"A lot, it's like cancer, the longer you wait to treat it, the worse it gets. Now, we better not waste any more time. I have a feeling this is going to be a long night.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe grabbed our supplies, then headed in. Were it not for the current circumstances I would've thought the house looked rather nice and welcoming.  Contrasting its appearance, I got the sense it was looming over us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"So, what's the plan here?\" I asked as Dean knocked on the door.\n\n\"Persistence and just to warn you, I saw some fucked up shit in there so be prepared.\u201d\n\n\u201cEasier said than done,\u201d I murmured.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDean didn\u2019t hear me as he was in what I like to call mission mode. The door was opened by an older woman who I presumed to be the victim\u2019s mother.  Her eyes were red and puffy. She introduced herself as Christa.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cCan you help Marcie?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do everything we can,\u201d Dean replied, then we stepped inside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA common trope when it comes to these situations is that the temperature of the surrounding home will drastically decrease. Although that does happen in some instances, it wasn't the case for us. Instead, there was this intense pressure. It felt vaguely akin to walking through a strong wind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Before we go downstairs, tell us everything that has been tried so far,\" Dean said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn addition to the mother, the father,  Weston was there along with Marcie\u2019s younger sister, Rosanne.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"We've tried all we could think of,\" Weston answered. \"Medicine, charms, you name it. We even tried to get some priests out here, but well, you saw how that went.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wondered what he meant by that and knew it couldn't mean anything good. Stone-faced, Dean motioned me to follow him. We got to the door going down to their basement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Remember, things like this feed on fear. You can feel it, but do your best not to show it. Oh, and make sure you're out of her reach.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe basement was dim with only a single light illuminating it. The others were busted with the faint hum of electricity coming from the wires along with occasional sparks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d I whispered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question was answered by a low moan. On all fours, she crawled into the light. It was easy to see why Dean was so freaked out before. She was in pajamas that I think were pink. It was hard to tell on account of the blood stains covering it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpeaking of, there were specs of it dried blood on her fingernails which were an unsettling length. Her toenails were in similar condition.  To make it worse I learned shortly that it belonged to someone else. Her skin had taken on a wilted complexion and there was a blindfold over her eyes. She sniffed the air.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cOh, you again.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t know how to describe her voice other than that it sounded unnatural. Dean\u2019s face hardened further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the blindfold?\u201d I asked, thinking I was talking low enough for her not to hear me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer head whipped in my direction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cSomeone new is with you.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy eyes were wide now. Dean glared at me, then focused back on the thing currently controlling Marcie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to concern yourself with him and we\u2019re going to get you out of this girl,\u201d Dean said.\n\n\u201cI see. Are you going to send more of those robed men? They tasted good You smell nice too. Why don\u2019t you come closer?.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe implication of that made my stomach lurch. How completely would she have needed to devour them for there to hardly be any traces left? Dean then did something that I found shocking given the situation. He smiled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cI doubt you\u2019d want me. I probably taste terrible, but I have to wonder why someone as great as you would even bother with us lowly humans?\"\n\n\"Don't think so highly of yourselves. You just happened to be the first species I came across.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*First? There are others?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Well, allow us to show you out,\" Dean replied, reaching into one of the bags.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe pulled out one of the crystals and held it pointed at Marcie. It turned pitch black and a faint bead of sweat trickled down his forehead. My heart rate ticked up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What does that mean?\" I asked, doing my best to make sure my voice didn't tremble.\n\n\"We aren't up against a ghost or some kind of demon. We're trying to vanquish a literal god.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy heart went from beating fast to abruptly ceasing. I tried backing away only for Dean to seize me by the arm. He squeezed hard, still keeping his gaze locked on Marcie. She cackled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"And I have trillions who bow to my whim.\"\n\n\"Regardless, you'll be leaving very soon.\"\n\n\"The others said something along those lines.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, she lurched forward. I yelled and jumped back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Relax,\" Dean snapped at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBreathing heavily, I willed myself to calm down. At the very least, the chains were doing a good job of restraining her. The downside was they did nothing about the scent which was iron mixed with rotted meat. She sniffed again and I asked myself why she kept focusing on me. Her face broke into a grin with her teeth also so stained with blood they appeared black.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"How intriguing,\" she commented. \"I can tell that there's something special about you, child.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI couldn't tell if she was serious or just messing with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Just ignore her,\" Dean ordered, rummaging through one of the bags.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom it, he pulled one of the jars. It was filled with pink powder. He poured some of it on his palm and threw it at Marcie. It hit her in the face and she breathed it in, coughing instantly. Dean then did the same thing with the other powders all with the same result.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I\u2019m guessing none of them worked?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe rejected them. We\u2019ll have to try something else. The problem is it requires us to get closer to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarcie grinned wider and tilted her head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cPlease do, I want to know how you feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice. Just do as I say.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe began pouring out the jars of powder, creating a circle around Marcie. She tried to swipe at us. However, we were out of her range. When it was complete, Dean then pulled out the jars of liquid. One by one, he opened them and set them on the floor.  As he did, he ordered me to put crystals in each one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did so, trying to ignore Marcie\u2019s presence. When I dropped the crystals in, they started glowing, taking on the color of their corresponding liquids.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Okay, this next part is extremely important,\" Dean said. \"You see the blindfold?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"They say the eyes are the window to the soul.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt clicked in my head what he wanted us to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I'm not going anywhere near her.\"\n\n\"When you're older, you'll be doing some of these alone. Do you trust me?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI glanced from him to Marcie who gave off the air of a tiger ready to pounce. Every fiber of my being wanted me to bolt back upstairs. I trusted Dean, though, and still do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen watch carefully.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDean pointed to the circle, made a motion of breaking something in half, and then shook his head. I nodded in understanding and we walked forward. Dean went around the circle. Mentally, I cured him because that meant I had to be the one to distract Marcie. It did make sense, seeing as how she was fascinated with me for some reason.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cTaking on such tasks at such a tender age, can\u2019t leave a good impression.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy throat was dry. I coughed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to prepare  me for dealing with things like you.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDean was inching his way forward. He reached out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cIs that so? Then I\u2019ll show you what you\u2019re in for.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe shot an arm behind her, grabbing Dean by the wrist. In the blink of an eye, she twisted her torso one-eighty and was crouching over him. My mind raced and luckily, I managed to think of something fast. I grabbed one of the crystals out of the jar and then ran at Marcie. From my viewpoint, she seemed to have her hands around Dean\u2019s throat. Truth be told, I didn\u2019t have a clue what the crystals were supposed to do and I was only hoping they\u2019d help somehow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I touched the one I held to her face, she hissed as if burned. Now focused back on me, her neck extended slightly and twisted upside down, making her smile resemble a frown. Against my instant instinct to move back, I snatched off her blindfold with my other hand. Her eyes rendered me speechless. This is because, she didn\u2019t actually have any, at least none that I could see.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn place of them was some kind of swirling mist with specs of flashing silver.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cThat was your last mistake, child.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn\u2019t have time to react to what happened next. She breathed out and the mist stretched from her eyes and mouth, engulfing my head, I felt it enter me, through my ears. It was one of the most disgusting sensations I\u2019ve ever experienced. It was as if there were worms wriggling inside me. I couldn\u2019t hear, see, or even breathe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was a voice in my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cI was right, You\u2019ll make a much better host than this girl.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was so panicked I couldn\u2019t even think. What happened next is something that even years later I still don\u2019t understand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWait\u2026No.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe way the tone sounded was bizarre. The best comparison I can draw is it was akin to someone cursing out somebody for cutting them off in traffic, then finding out it\u2019s their boss. There was fear in the voice now. It kept repeating no. There was a feeling of bile in my throat. The next thing I knew, I was being shaken awake by Dean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cZane,\u201d he shouted repeatedly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI shot up, realizing first that we were still in the basement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWhat happened? How long was I out?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a few minutes and your guess is as good as mine. I saw her breathing that shit into you and then you breathed it back out and somehow that cured Marcie.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI glanced back at Marcie who aside from her clothes wouldn\u2019t seem different from any other deep-sleeping teenager.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWhere did the mist go?\u201d I asked,\n\n\u201cIt disappeared. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need to worry about it again any time soon.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI let out a long exhale.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d Dean said, helping me to my feet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe finished things with the Bairds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t thank you enough,\u201d Weston told Dean as they shook hands.\n\n\u201cAll in a night\u2019s work,\u201d he replied.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was accurate seeing as how the first rays of sunlight were already peeking over the horizon. I shook hands with Weston as well, then we left and began our drive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cHow did that take so long?\u201d I asked, exhausted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe yawned before replying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cEorcisms are like that. Plus, the one we did was exceptionally difficult, but you did well, Zane. Good job.\u201d\n\n\"Thanks, I just want to go home right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and me both.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy phone vibrated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cTalked with Sheila. Think she is cool. We still on for today?\u201d the text from Brice read.\n\n\u201cDean?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI showed him the text. Even though he was tired and annoyed, he agreed to take me to Brice\u2019s house. I guess he figured I deserved something for helping out. Thankfully, we didn\u2019t have to go too far out of the way, and following another text from Brice, we went to his address. Dean talked to me before I got out of the car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t lie. I am fucking beat so can you see about spending the night here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can try.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe took out some cash and handed it to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn case they decide to order something, you can offer to pay. It\u2019s to be polite.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, right.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went into the glove compartment and took out an unopened toothbrush along with some toothpaste. We thought it\u2019d be a good idea to have some in the future for long trips.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy you made it, Zane.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you too. Hey, sorry to spring this on you and your parents, but would it be possible for me to spend the night?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be okay with it. Let me check. Hey, mom!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d came a voice from the other room.\n\n\u201cCan Zane spend the night?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes he have a toothbrush and toothpaste?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe turned back to me. I held them up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cYeah, he has them!\u201d\n\n\u201cMake sure he wipes his feet before coming in!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore entering, I gave Dean a thumbs up. He waved, then drove off.\n\n\u201cMake yourself at home,\u201d Brice said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the horrors of the previous night, it was good to unwind. We played Budokai Tenkaichi 3 for a while despite my fatigue, I did decently. I wanted to enjoy playing with him for a lot longer and ended up falling asleep. Brice\u2019s family was nice enough to put some covers over me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat\u2019ll do for this post. Even though it was a long one, I think it\u2019s helped a little to get these experiences off my chest. I\u2019ll probably be doing more of these in between updates on the Cursed Contest Tapes or the Ludus Tapes as we sometimes call them. Anyway, I need some shut-eye.

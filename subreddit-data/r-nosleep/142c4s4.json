    "postText": "\u201cHe walks these halls with steps like dripping water.\r  \nHis bloated hands are as purple as rot in dark places.\r  \nHe passes through the walls with the damp and chilly air.\r  \nIf I die in here, it wasn't sickness, it wasn't an accident, it wasn't suicide\u2013\r  \nIt was HIM.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe note was stuck to the bottom of the bed; I only found it because I was looking for a way to rip a piece off of the frame\u2013to hurt myself with. I was going through a very dark time in my life\u2026and it was about to get darker.\r  \n\rI'd been admitted to the Pine Hill Mental Hospital after my breakdown in mid-January\u2013\r  \nBut I suspected that it always felt like winter at Pine Hill. The corridors were cold and drafty, and the thick dusty windows made the skies outside seem perpetually gray. With their stressed expressions and exhausted, shambling walk, it was hard to tell the staff apart from the patients.\r  \nPine Hill Mental Hospital was a place where society dumped the people it was ashamed of, then conveniently forgot them.\r  \n\r  \nI couldn't have said why I kept the odd little note. It felt like a good luck charm, or at least a reminder that somebody out there had been crazier than I was.\r  \nUntil the night I was woken by a strange sound, like dripping water. I sat up in the blue darkness, listening as it passed by my door and entered the room next door. It took my sleep-addled brain a moment to realize what was so wrong about that fact: the door had never opened.\r  \nWhatever it was, it was just suddenly inside the room next door.\r  \nThe walls in Pine Hill were thick stone, but noise traveled in the place. Like the man across the hall who'd laughed for days straight until his throat was so raw that he fell silent, or the old woman to my left who moaned in her sleep. But from the room to my right, I'd barely heard a sound.\r  \nUntil now.\r  \n\"H-hello?\" A husky voice asked \"...who are you?\"\r  \nDrip. Drip. Silence.\r  \n\"What're you doin' in my room?!\" Tiredness had been replaced by fear. \"Hey! Say somethin'!\"\r  \nThere was no reply but the echo of droplets hitting the floor.\r  \nThen the strangling sounds began.\r  \nIt was like the person in the room beside me was choking on their own tongue. I frantically pressed the panic button, with no result but the desperate clicking of plastic.\r  \nDrip. Drip.\r  \nNo more noise came from the adjacent room\u2026but I had an awful feeling something was listening. I let go of the panic button and shut my eyes tight.\r  \nI woke to the squeaky wheels of a guernsey.\r  \nA body was being removed from the room beside me.\r  \nIf I die in here, it wasn't sickness, it wasn't an accident, it wasn't suicide.\r  \nHe passes through the walls with the damp and chilly air.\r  \nHis bloated hands are as purple as rot in dark places.\r  \nHe walks these halls\u2013\r  \nWith steps like dripping water.\r  \n\"God, I hate this month,\" an orderly grumbled from the hallway. \"Why'dya think they always punch their ticket in February, huh?\"\r  \n\"Fuck if I know,\" his partner snorted. \"Nasty, dreary weather. No holidays. Start of another miserable goddamn year. Take your pick.\"\r  \nMy heart was racing. Had I just hallucinated the awful events of the night? Or was there something more to the note I'd found beneath my bed. As I waited for my session with the chief psychiatrist, Dr. Harlow, I wondered which was more terrifying: not being able to trust my own mind, or whatever haunted the halls of Pine Hill Mental Hospital.\r  \nDr. Harlow was a white-haired, muscular man who reeked of optimism and clean living. Up close, I would've sworn that he actually smelled like the organic vegetable section of the supermarket. He shook my hand and flashed a bright smile before our session. Considering how gloomy the hospital was, I wondered how he pulled it off. The man's cheerfulness bordered on the delusional, but he didn't miss a trick.\r  \n\"We've been talking about the events that led to your admission to Pine Hill, but you seem distracted. How are you adjusting to your stay here?\"\r  \n\"It's a big change,\" I admitted. \"I was always the strong one, the one who never complained\u2026and I guess I just never imagined that I could end up here.\"\r  \n\"We each have our cross to bear.\" Dr. Harlow smiled and tapped the rim of his wheelchair. \"Often it's not the one we would have expected.\" He didn't sound like he bought my story; looking at the metal cage around his leg, I wondered what had happened to the guy.\r  \n\"If anything\u2026bothers you\u2026during your time with us,\" Dr. Harlow went on, \"remember that I'm always listening.\"\r  \nIt was only later, back behind the locked door of my room, that the good doctor's final comment might have meant more than it seemed.\r  \nDr. Harlow held the keys to my freedom from Pine Hills, but as long as I was there, I had bigger problems. Like Big Bill.\r  \nBig Bill was a huge nurse who seemed to take my mental illness personally. I'd don't know whether I reminded him of someone he hated or if he just didn't like my face, but whatever it was, he seemed to enjoy making me hurt. When he drew blood, I watched him smile evilly as he missed vein after vein on purpose. He'd rough-handle and shoulder-check me every chance he got, and I wasn't the only one: he left a scrawny teenager locked naked in the shower room until his lips turned blue and he was shivering too much to stand. When I complained to Nurse Avery\u2013one of the kindest orderlies\u2013she just sighed:\r  \n\"Big Bill is the nephew of some board member or other. Even the psychiatrists can't stand the guy, but there's nothing we can do.\"\r  \nThe scrawny teenager approached us, shamelessly eavesdropping on our conversation.\r  \n\"Can I help you, Harrison?\" Avery rolled her eyes at him.\r  \n\"Yeah,\" the teen sniffled, \"actually I think you can. You do the schedules, right?\"\r  \n\"That's very perceptive of you.\" Avery nodded.\r  \n\"Could you put Big Bill on the night shift?\"\r  \n\"I guess I could\u2026I'd probably catch hell for it, though. And are you sure you'd wanna risk being alone with that guy at night? I mean, even during the day, the rest of us can barely hold him back\u2026\"\r  \n\"Just a week or two. That's all I ask. By then I'm sure Bill's board-member-uncle will have blown up at you and you'll have to apologize to those scumbags\u2026but it would mean the world to me.\"\r  \n\"I don\u2019t wanna make an enemy of Big Bill\u2026\" Avery hesitated.\r  \n\"Come on,\" Harrison begged. He pulled up his shirt to reveal a series of hideous purple bruises, \"please\u2026\"\r  \nI knew Big Bill had found out about the shift change when I heard him roar and kick the crutches out from under the legs of the nearest patient. Harrison smirked. I didn't know what he was playing at, but as I rubbed the jab-wounds in my arms\u2026I hope it worked.\r  \nAs cruel as Big Bill could be, I didn\u2019t envy him for his nighttime patrols. Even before I'd discovered the note, Pine Hill had struck me as a uniquely eerie place\u2013especially after dark.\r  \nThe hundred-year-old building creaked and groaned as it shed its renovations, and when the cold fluorescent lights flickered, it was easy to see things that weren\u2019t there.\r  \nBig Bill whistled nervously as he completed his rounds, pausing only to make a single statement:\r  \n\u201cWhen I find out which one of you nutjobs is responsible for this, you\u2019re gonna wish you\u2019d never been born.\u201d\r  \nIt happened four nights later. A fierce wind had been blowing all day, and the power had already gone out twice. The emergency lighting worked, but it was dim; the wails and gibbering of some of my fellow patients when the lights went out made me think of a Bible verse from my youth: \u201che will be cast into the Outer Darkness, where there is Weeping and Gnashing of Teeth.\u201d\r  \nIt was driving Big Bill nuts.\r  \n\u201cShut up! SHUT. UP!\u201d I could hear him beating on someone\u2019s door with his nightstick. Seconds later, his crazed face appeared in the square plexiglass window of my room. His eyes were wild, his face red from all the screaming; I could see clumps of spit and snot in his brown mustache. \u201cWhat about you, freak? You want some? Or are you gonna off yourself like my little brother? You freaks are all the same\u2013\u201d\r  \nDrip. Drip.\r  \nIt was the same sound as before\u2026and it was coming from right behind Big Bill. Through my small window I watched huge, purplish-blue fingers coil around his neck. His eyes grew wide with surprise\u2013\r  \nThen slid out of focus as he collapsed.\r  \nThe coroner ruled his death a heart attack.\r  \nThe next day, there was a memorial poster in the cafeteria for \u2018William \u201cBig Bill\u201d Coombs: Mentor, Caregiver, and Friend.\u2019  Harrison was caught scratching the faces off of a few of the smiling photos. When the orderlies released him, I took him aside for a hushed conversation:\r  \n\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d I demanded.\r  \n\u201cKnow what?\u201d Harrison scratched his neck and looked away.\r  \n\u201cCome on. Big Bill. That weird dripping noise. I found a note beneath my bed\u2026about HIM.\u201d Harrison was panicking before I\u2019d even finished speaking. He crouched down, eyes darting all around him as though he expected some awful thing with rotten blue hands to come crawling out of the ceiling tiles.\r  \n\"Shhhh!\" Harrison rasped. \"He's always listening!\"\r  \nThe orderlies watched suspiciously; I tried desperately to get Harrison calmed down. I might never have another chance to find out what he knew.\r  \n\"Look, it's daylight, we're in the cafeteria, lots of people around\u2026he can't hurt you here.\" I took a deep breath. \"Who\u2026or what\u2026is 'he?'\"\r  \n\u201cI call him the February Man. He always comes around during this month, and when he does\u2026people die.\u201d Harrison scratched his neck again. \u201cOh, sure, the deaths usually look natural\u2026or at least unexplainable\u2026but they\u2019re not. Not at all.\u201d\r  \n\u201cHaven\u2019t you told anyone?\u201d\r  \n\u201cI\u2019ve been in here six different times now. Who\u2019s gonna listen to me? Besides\u2026\u201d Harrison lowered his voice \u201c...I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m next. If I don\u2019t get out of here soon\u2026\u201d\r  \nDuring my session with Dr. Harlow that evening, I pleaded Harrison\u2019s case:\r  \n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s possible\u2026that being in here hurts some people more than it helps them? Like Harrison, for instance\u2026he\u2019s convinced there\u2019s some murderous ghost haunting Pine Hill, and having to deal with THAT, on top of all the other issues he\u2019s facing\u2026\u201d I trailed off.\r  \n\u201cWe all want Harrison\u2019s suffering to end,\u201d Dr. Harlow rolled over and squeezed my shoulder kindly, \u201cbut it isn\u2019t going to happen out there. He needs treatment.\u201d The doctor stroked the metal cage on his leg thoughtfully. \u201cStill, I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. It\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re making progress. I may be able to sign your release papers before long\u2026\u201d My heart leapt in my chest. The prospect of getting out\u2013of going back to pick up the shattered pieces of my life\u2013was thrilling and terrifying at the same time. \u201cHave you heard anything else about this \u2018ghost\u2019 of Harrison\u2019s?\u201d\r  \n\u201cHarrison, well\u2026he calls it \u2018The February Man.\u2019 He says that\u2019s when it kills. He says it has rotten purplish hands and can walk through walls\u2026\u201d\r  \n\u201cFascinating!\u201d Dr. Harlow chuckled. \u201cWell, I suppose I\u2019ll have to bring it up with the other patients. We don\u2019t want a mass hysteria on our hands! Come, we need to get you back to your room. It\u2019s almost time for Lights Out.\u201d\r  \nBack in my room, I thought about Harrison:\r  \nAbout how he\u2019d been so sure that he was in danger.\r  \nAbout how he\u2019d stayed close to me ever since our conversation, like he was scared to be alone.\r  \nNow he was locked up by himself in a dark room, just like I was\u2026\r  \nAnd it was almost time for The February Man to start making his rounds.\r  \nI shivered, rolled over, and fell into a dreamless sleep.\r  \nI dreamed of dripping water, and woke to the sound of a squeaky wheel. The Guernsey.\r  \n\u201cWhat happened to this one?\u201d an orderly was asking.\r  \n\u201cHe got ahold of some sleeping pills somehow. You know that little corner of the rooms, the one where the camera can\u2019t quite see? He went back there and took\u2019em. They\u2019re gonna give us hell for this,\u201d his companion complained.\r  \nI sat up in bed. Harrison.\r  \n\u201cWhat about these weird bruises on his neck, though?\u201d\r  \n\u201cLet\u2019s just say he wasn\u2019t very popular with some of the staff. Remember Big Bill?\u201d The orderly laughed. My blood ran cold.\r  \nBig Bill never hit patients where the bruises could be seen\u2026which meant that Harrison\u2019s bruises were new. Probably from last night. I remembered the final line of the note:\r  \nIf I die in here, it wasn't sickness, it wasn't an accident, it wasn't suicide\u2013\r  \nIt was HIM.\r  \nThe February Man.\r  \n\u201cI know how this is going to sound,\u201d I told Dr. Harlow during our session that afternoon, \u201cbut I think Harrison was onto something.\u201d The doctor lifted an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019m not saying its ghosts or a curse or anything like that\u2013but three deaths in one month?!\u201d\r  \n\u201cThe winter months are always a rough time for us,\u201d Dr. Harlow sighed. \u201cStatistics bear out that these months are when excess deaths occur, and while these accidents are unfortunate\u2013\u201d\r  \n\u201cHarrison had bruises on his neck!\u201d I screamed. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been hearing things before the deaths! This weird dripping sound!\u201d\r  \nDr. Harrison grabbed his legs until his knuckles turned white, grimacing.\r  \n\u201cThese delusions and loss of self-control are a most unsettling sign with regards to your progress\u2013\u201d\r  \n\u201cI don\u2019t CARE about my \u2018PROGRESS!\u2019 People are DYING!\u201d I sprang to my feet in a rage; two orderlies burst in and dragged me, raving, back to my room. They weren\u2019t gentle, but then again, neither was I. The worst part was, Dr. Harlow was right: I had lost control.\r  \nIf I couldn't trust myself to express my emotions without getting violent, how could I trust my memories of what I thought I\u2019d heard stalking the nighttime hallways at Pine Hill? I\u2019d just blown my best shot at freedom, and if these were delusions, they\u2019d probably only get worse the longer I stayed here\u2026\r  \n\u201cThey really worked you over, didn\u2019t they?\u201d Nurse Avery whistled when she peered through my window.\r  \n\u201cHarrison didn\u2019t kill himself! You\u2019ve got to believe me! It was\u2013\u201d\r  \n\"Shhh. I'm on duty tonight\u2026and I wanted to give you this.\" Glancing over her shoulders, she passed a square plastic remote through the door. \"This is one of the panic buttons we used back in the day. You're not supposed to have it, so keep it hidden. If anything\u2026weird\u2026happens tonight, you call me, okay?\"\r  \nI slipped the plastic remote beneath my hospital-issued shirt, too grateful to say thanks.\r  \nIt felt a lot less comforting after lights out. The drafty air blew over me like monster's breath; shadows seemed to move in the corners of my room. Then I heard it.\r  \nDrip. Drip.\r  \nMy breath caught in my throat. It was coming from inside the wall! The emergency light and camera on my wall suddenly went dead\u2026and the wall behind me opened like a hungry mouth.\r  \nDrip. Drip.\r  \nIn what little light reached in from the hall, I saw a pair of large, bluish-purple hands emerge from the blackness.\r  \nIt wasn't the rot of death I was looking at\u2013it was surgical gloves.\r  \nDrip. Creak.\r  \nIt wasn't dripping I was hearing; it was creaking.\r  \nThe creak of a metal leg brace.\r  \nDr. Harlow limped through from the passageway behind the wall.\r  \n\"You ended Harrison's suffering\u2026by killing him.\" I gasped. \"You didn't approve of Big Bill's methods\u2026so you got rid of him, too. And the person in the room beside me\u2026\"\r  \n\"Another lost cause. Like Harrison. Like you. If you can't be cured, you don't deserve to spend your life trapped in your own mind. You deserve\u2026mercy.\" The needle glinted in his blue-gloved hand.\r  \nI mashed the button Nurse Avery had given me.\r  \nThe plastic clicked, but no sound came.\r  \nThe panic button was old\u2013when was the last time anyone had checked the batteries?\r  \nDr. Harlow's leg brace slowed him down, but I knew that if his huge muscular hands got ahold of me, it was over. There was nowhere to run in the tiny room\u2026\r  \nFootsteps hurried to my door.  Surprise replaced ruthlessness on Dr. Harlow's face; he backed away toward the hidden door in the wall\u2013\r  \nToo slow. Nurse Avery burst through the door with two orderlies, who stared at Dr. Harlow with disbelieving eyes.\r  \nThe good doctor had been caught in the act.\r  \nBetween the coverup, the chaos, and the whirling rumors, Harlow's replacement had a lot on her plate. She spoke to me only twice before signing my release order.\r  \nI would be leaving Pine Hill Mental Hospital a changed man\u2013although not in the way that 'The February Man' had intended.\n\n\r  \n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/beardify)",

That being said, your mental health is really important and whatever you're dealing with (in addition to your murderous former doctor) should never be devalued. \nWith your release being expedited due to your traumatic experience, I'd recommend seeking outpatient care to help you regain your self confidence and sense of wellbeing; but I also recommend keeping tabs on the \"February Man\" periodically, just in case. \nGood luck and stay safe!",

    "postText": "Part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13u9t3m/my_father_always_kept_the_shed_locked_today_i/\n\n\nPart 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13vycj7/my_father_always_kept_the_shed_locked_today_i/\n\n\nThe Undergraves were as close to literal Hell as I could imagine. In fact, we only survived because of a twist of fate and a sad, lonely mutant.\n\n\nThere were creatures everywhere, and most of them were horrible things to behold. More of the strange pig-men with long knives had come out of the surrounding rooms. They always had human bodies hung up and butchered, drying meat stretched out on hooks all around the room. Hell, if Gil and I had no problem with cannibalism, we could eat for years in this place. \n\n\nI had shot at least a dozen of the pig-men, trying to conserve my ammo by using only a single headshot where possible, and Gil had decapitated probably a dozen more. Some of them we just ran away from, especially if there were large groups. But it felt like we were going further into the fire rather than escaping from it. \n\n\nThere were windows now, endless windows along the sides of the rooms, and they showed a world in flames. I saw people with missing limbs huddled around barrel fires in bombed-out cities, husks of tanks scattered across the street and bodies hanging from the lampposts. I began to see where the meat to feed all these creatures was coming from. Gil and I found a room with a pyramid of clothes, shoes and glasses that stretched to the top of the room.\n\n\n\u201cBrother,\u201d Gil said, \u201cthis place makes me sick.\u201d I sighed, sitting down on a pile of clothes and opening some beef jerky and a candy bar. I checked my ammo supplies, and realized I was down to my last magazine.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to get out of this fucking place,\u201d I said. \u201cThe smell of so many dead bodies must have seeped into my clothes by now.\u201d Then I heard a soft rustling from behind me. I turned my body, pulling up the gun and pointing it. A strange man stood there with his hands up.\n\n\nHe reminded me of pictures I had seen of the Elephantman. Tumors and scarred, rounded growths stuck out all over his head. His forehead sloped radically to the left, and one of his eyes was slanted, the folds of skin around it hanging loosely above and beneath it. He had on an old military uniform, one I assumed he scrounged from some dead body. My finger tightened on the trigger for a moment, then I relaxed. He had no visible weapons.\n\n\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d he said. \u201cCan I get a chocolate bar?\u201d I laughed, breaking the tension and handing him an Eisenheart. It was, apparently, a brand he knew and loved, for he ripped it open and ate it, smiling and bowing. I gave him a soda too. His face brightened like a child\u2019s. \u201cThank you, thank you! Nice men, very nice.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, friend?\u201d Gil said slowly, still holding his bowie knife tightly. I still had my finger on the trigger as well, but I had a feeling we wouldn\u2019t need weapons for this guy.\n\n\n\u201cFrankie,\u201d he said. His smile was so wide now that it showed all three of his remaining teeth. \u201cI\u2019m a friend?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy not? Frankie, my name is Luke, and this is Gil. We\u2019re good guys. We\u2019re\u2026 not from here. In fact, we are trying to get out. Do you know how to get out of here?\u201d Frankie paused for a long moment, as if that many sentences at once had overloaded his brain\u2019s processing power. His face took on a slack, vacant look. Then he brightened and nodded.\n\n\n\u201cYou can go to Rusty Township right out there,\u201d he said excitedly, pointing out the window to where a woman\u2019s body was being picked apart by angry, squawking birds. I shook my head, smiling.\n\n\n\u201cWhile that seems like a real nice place,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m actually looking for another where. We came down here on the circular stone stairs. Some\u2026 uh, real nice people told us that those stairs could be found over here in the Undergraves, if you follow that strange hallway covered in muscle and skin straight.\u201d Those \u201creal nice people\u201d had also been cheering and clapping as they shoved one another in an iron maiden and let the blood soak into the floors, I remembered. Frankie laughed, a genuine, happy sound that felt strange in this place.\n\n\n\u201cNo, friend,\u201d he said, wiping a tear from his eye, \u201cif you go straight into the Undergraves, you come to the Pit of the Skull. There\u2019s thousands of angry demons in there. They\u2019d eat you.\u201d He continued laughing. \u201cI think your other friends played a joke on you.\u201d I swore, my face darkening. Gil looked like he was about to be sick.\n\n\n\u201cNever trust a woman with scurvy blossoms on her face,\u201d Gil muttered. \u201cI should have known.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo we would have died if we followed their directions?\u201d I asked. Frankie nodded. I wanted to go back to where I had seen them and use the last of my magazine on those sick weirdos, but I tried to focus on my breathing and calm down.\n\n\n\u201cJesus man, it\u2019s a good thing we found you,\u201d Gil said, reaching into his pocket with his unmutilated hand. \u201cYou want another chocolate bar?\u201d\n\n\n\\***\n\n\nFrom what we learned from Frankie, who tended to stare off into space and drift off topic but seemed otherwise all there, the people who sacrificed each other to the iron maiden or, as they called it, the steel mistress, were all refugees from Rusty Township. They were also apparently cannibal cult members. Once they had drained the blood from whoever picked the burnt match or played Tic Tac Toe the worst or whatever other insane way they chose, they would throw the mutilated body into the opening of the Undergraves. The demons would come out after the drums and drag the body away to eat it. And the cult members also tended to send wayward travelers, like ourselves, down into the Undergraves to get killed and eaten by demons. Apparently they thought these precautions kept them safe from the majority of the horrors of the Undergraves, and hell, they had survived this long, so maybe they were right.\n\n\nThe urge to go back and murder the whole lot of them came strongly to me. I could see Gil felt the same way. But getting home was far more important.\n\n\nFrankie had lived here for years, foraging from the occasional vending machines and stealing supplies from the cult members and demons. I assumed this means he ate human meat for a lot of his calories, but I wasn\u2019t going to point it out. It just didn\u2019t seem polite at this point. He seemed like a hard guy to upset though. After all the things he had seen, it was hard to imagine him turning out otherwise.\n\n\nBut it also meant he knew the halls and intersections like the back of his hand. When I explained to him the staircase we had come through, his eyes lit up.\n\n\n\u201cI know it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is nowhere near the Undergraves. It changes, but it is always found at either the beginning of the Endless Hall\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where we came in, I think,\u201d Gil said. \u201cIt seemed endless enough.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOr it hides between the meeting place of Veriden and Rusty Township.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo we were right next to it?\u201d I asked angrily. Now I *really* wanted to kill those lunatic cult members. Frankie nodded, drawing back slightly, his eyes widening at my anger.\n\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s go,\u201d Gil said, looking more tired than I had ever seen him, holding the bloody, bandaged remains of his hand against his chest and wincing. \u201cI\u2019m tired as hell, but I\u2019d like to get out of here before those nutjobs find us and throw us in an iron maiden, or maybe some pig monster slices me up and makes jerky from my muscles.\u201d Frankie shook his head violently.\n\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Frankie said, \u201cif you go back the way you came, you will die. The drums stopped.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat are the drums?\u201d I asked. He shrugged.\n\n\n\u201cThey come from the ceilings and walls,\u201d he said, describing a small, black box that sounded like a speaker. \u201cMaybe they were originally set up before the collapse of Rusty Township. I know not, friend.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a flying fuck about the drums,\u201d Gil said. \u201cWhat happens if we just walk back the way we came?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe cleaner comes after the drums,\u201d Frankie said in a whisper. \u201cThe cleaner is mean. He is a tall, metal man, as tall as the ceilings, and he is strong. I\u2019ve seen him snap the pig-men in half.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo is there another way around the main hall?\u201d I asked. Frankie took a long moment to think, then he nodded.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous too,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tunnel underneath leads back, but it has strange things.\u201d This was all he would say about it. \n\n\n\u201cOK, Frankie, lead the way,\u201d Gil said, throwing the deformed man a bag of beef jerky and a soda. We were getting very low on food and drinks by this point, but as I saw it, it wouldn\u2019t matter. Either we would get out, and we would have plenty of food and drinks back home, or we wouldn\u2019t, and we wouldn\u2019t need food and drinks if that was the case. An old riddle popped into my head as I considered this. *What is greater than God, worse than the devil, the dead eat it always, but if the living eat it, then they die? Nothing.*\n\n\nFrankie got up quickly, eating the entire bag of beef jerky in a single swallow, which I didn\u2019t even know was possible until I saw him do it. His cheeks were stuffed like a chipmunk, and he chewed slowly and thoughtfully with his few remaining teeth, savoring the taste of the meat.\n\n\nThen he went back behind a pile of clothes, felt around on the floor, and with a cry of triumph, pulled out a weapon. It was just a baseball bat with rusty, bent nails sticking out of it like the broken quills of a porcupine, but it was better than nothing.\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, friends,\u201d Frankie said. \u201cI would do anything to help my new friends. You should go home, where you belong. We all need a home\u2026\u201d He trailed off sadly. I looked around at where he lived, and my heart broke for him.\n\n\nHe stuck his huge head out the door, looking up and down the main hallway of the Undergraves. Slick, muscular growths covered the walls, the ceiling and the floor. The red stuff seemed to contract and expand, as if it were undergoing peristalsis.\n\n\nWith a look back, he nodded and went forward. We followed along, placing all of our trust in this strange being who called us his friends.\n\n\n\\***\n\n\nThe hatchway to the tunnel was in an auxiliary room a few hundred feet down the hall. I walked in front next to Frankie, seeing as I had a gun and needed to be able to shoot in an instant without worrying about them being in my way. The hatchway was rusted and ancient-looking. It had a wheel that had to be turned to open it, and it took the strength of all three of us to get it moving. It squealed loudly, flakes of rust splintering off it. I cursed under my breath, hoping that it wouldn\u2019t draw attention. As soon as it was open, we went down the ladder, one by one, underneath the main hall.\n\n\nThe tunnel was cramped and dark. Red emergency lights placed every hundred feet or so gave us some illumination, but not much. Everything had a bloody glow to it. And there were auxiliary shafts running off the main one, some with no lights at all. But in the darkness, I could have sworn I saw movement, as if a slightly less black silhouette were moving towards us through the darkness.\n\n\nWe got through as fast as we could. Another ladder led up, and we took it. But that strange sensation of being followed by dark shapes hadn\u2019t left me.\n\n\nThe ladder opened into a room I didn\u2019t recognize at first. The hatchway panel opened up into a place filled with detritus, broken furniture and mold spread out all over the floor. But when we got into the main hallway, I felt like cheering. Further down, I saw the sign for the intersection of Rusty Township and Veriden. And crossing in front of it, I saw the cult members who had tried to give us directions to the ninth circle of Hell, or whatever that place truly was.\n\n\n\u201cStop right fucking there!\u201d I screamed, raising the gun. The dark-haired woman with the scurvy blossoms on her face jumped so high, I thought she might fall over. The other cult members turned and looked at me, surprised and afraid. \u201cDidn\u2019t expect to see me again, did you? Thought I would get killed by demons and maybe you could take my body and eat it? Or just give it as a sacrifice to those abominations?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSir, I am sorry,\u201d the woman said, \u201cbut we must get out of here. The machine\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStay right there, or I will blow your goddamn head off,\u201d I said, walking forwards quickly and shoving the gun in her face. \u201cYour brains will be dripping off the wall. You\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d\n\n\nAnd then I heard it. A mechanical whine started down the hallway, coming closer.\n\n\n\u201cThe cleaner,\u201d Frankie whispered in a tone that reminded me of the scared voice of a child. \u201cOh God, the cleaner\u2026\u201d\n\n\nI kept the gun raised, but prodded the woman forwards towards the intersection of the three hallways, looking down towards the Rusty Township side, where the noises were coming from. What I saw sent my heart racing.\n\n\nIt was a robot, at least ten feet tall. Its silvery skin shone in the flickering fluorescent lights. It had two eyes that shone white LED light, a slit of a mouth, and long arms and legs that looked like they had been made of steel beams.\n\n\n\u201cFreeze,\u201d it said in an emotionless voice. \u201cPlease show identification.\u201d The cult members screamed and started to scatter like cockroaches. The robot instantly responded upon seeing them move, taking one of its long arms and running forward, whipping it across the hall in a blur. I heard bones crack and saw bodies break as they were pushed into the walls and, in one case, out of the window. I heard shrieking for a few seconds as the hapless man fell to his death.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve killed us all,\u201d the dark-haired woman told me accusingly. She tried to run away from me as I backpedaled away from the insane robot, but it grabbed her, twisting off her neck with a loud crack. Blood poured out of her head as the robot threw it across the ground, rolling it like a bowling ball.\n\n\n\u201cYou are in violation of executive order number 82,\u201d the robot said. \u201cShow identification, or lethal force will be used.\u201d It was running at me now, and I saw it approaching as if in slow motion. I knew I was dead.\n\n\nAnd then Frankie came running out, swinging his baseball bat as hard as he could into the robot\u2019s back. The nails stuck into the metal. I saw his large muscles bulging as he tried to pull it out. But before he could, the robot turned and hit him with a balled-up metal hand. Frankie\u2019s skull collapsed inwards as he fell, crumpling into a heap in the corner.\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d I screamed, running forwards. I looked at the bright eyes of the robot, and suddenly, an idea came to me. It was the only one I had.\n\n\nI started emptying the magazine into the robot\u2019s face, and within seconds, its white eyes had burst. My ears were ringing from so many gunshots in such a small space. Sparks and wires shot out, and the robot began to wail. The smell of gunpowder and burning metal filled the area.\n\n\n\u201cVisual centers offline,\u201d it said, \u201cvisual centers offline. This is a catastrophic error. Contact Victoriat Arms Corporation and report the location and type of this error. A large reward is offered. Please call 1-600-333\u2026\u201d I stopped listening. The robot had begun to move randomly, swinging its arms and legs in wide circles as its alarm blared. I saw it crush a few more cult members to death. It smashed into the walls, breaking the sheetrock and leaving huge dents and holes everywhere.\n\n\nI ran over to Frankie. He was still alive, though he was fading rapidly. His eyes were shutting.\n\n\n\u201cDid I help my friends?\u201d he said slowly, sadly. I nodded, a single tear falling from my eye.\n\n\n\u201cYou saved us,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d He nodded, then closed his eyes and let out a long breath.\n\n\n\u201cThe stairs\u2026 are down the Veriden hall. Before the train to Naraka,\u201d he said. \u201cGo home, friend. Go home.\u201d Blood pooled around his broken head as his lips began to turn blue and his breath stopped.\n\n\nGil pulled me up, whispering in my ear.\n\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re being followed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to go now.\u201d And so we did. We began running down the hallway. I looked back, seeing the bodies of the dead cult members and the kamikaze writhings of the robot as he smashed into random rooms and went further down the hallway towards Rusty Township.\n\n\nBut there was something there, something dark and humanoid. I squinted, but it faded into the shadows.\n\n\n\u201cThere!\u201d Gil yelled, pointing to a door I recognized. It was a chipped blue door with a daisy painted on the front. My euphoria and elation was so high at seeing it that I grabbed Gil and hugged him.\n\n\n\u201cFrankie did it,\u201d I said. \u201cHe got us here\u2026\u201d And then we heard the shriek from behind us. I turned to look, but it was all dark shadows now behind us. The flickering lights had died.\n\n\nWe flung open the door, running through it. It opened on the same circular stone steps that we had used to get down here. They were still slick, still endless, and still had no railing, but my adrenaline was so high that I just started sprinting. My fear of heights had nothing on my fears of what was down here with us.\n\n\nBut whatever it was following us, it was getting closer. I could hear it gaining, hear it shrieking. I checked my gun as I ran, and was not surprised to see I had no ammo left. All we had was that damned bowie knife.\n\n\nI was exhausted, but we kept running, on the verge of passing out. Eventually the temperature started to go up, and the air felt less oppressive and thick. I could see the entrance to the shed a few more revolutions up around the circular stones. Using the last of our energy, we sprinted to the end of the stairs.\n\n\nWe ran out into the shed, clearing the last of the slick, stone steps. The door was locked, just like when we left it. There seemed to be new gouges in the plate metal shielding the interior of the shed, deep claw marks and lines running every which way, but especially over the shielding for the door. Gil fumbled in his pockets for the key.\n\n\n\u201cHurry up,\u201d I said through gritted teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201d Gil said, reaching into every pocket. He kept coming up empty-handed. He had lost the key, and now we were going to die.\n\n\nThen he reached into the little pocket built into the main pocket of his right front jeans, and I heard a tiny jingle. He brought up the leather strap with the shed key on it. With shaking hands, he shoved it in the lock and began turning.\n\n\nI heard deep thudding footsteps only feet behind us now, and a demonic voice began to shriek. My ears rang in a high-pitched squealing, but I kept my hand on the now useless gun, looking back and forth from the door to the last step. Just as Gil pushed open the door, I saw it.\n\n\nIt had empty, black sockets where its eyes should have been. Its skin looked like the tight, desiccated skin of a mummy, and it seemed to tremble and writhe as its body moved. Its mouth opened nearly to the center of its chest, just a huge, black void that sent out deafening screams constantly, seemingly without needing to breathe.\n\n\nWe slammed the door shut. I put all my body weight against it as Gil put the key into the lock and began to turn. There was a tremendous shaking as the abomination slammed into the door, and then Gil clicked the lock into place and pulled the key out. I slid to the floor, my heart beating so fast that I couldn\u2019t feel the individual beats anymore.\n\n\nAfter resting a while, we went back into the house. Gil flipped on the TV, where we saw \u201cBreaking News\u201d flashing across the screen on our local channel.\n\n\n\u201cThe death of an entire family in Lancester County today continues to remain unsolved. Authorities state the neighbor found the bodies of Larry Matheson, age 46, his wife Linda Matheson, age 41, and their children, Jonathan Matheson, age 11, Jordan Matheson, age 7, and Abigail Matheson, age 3. Authorities state that the amount of violence at the scene was \u2018unbelievable\u2019, and that the victims were physically mutilated both before and after death.\n\n\n\u201cIn addition, authorities told our reporters that the heads of the children were removed, and that they still found no sign of them. Police believe the killer or killers likely took the heads with them.\n\n\n\u201cAnyone with any leads is asked to call\u2026\u201d I shut off the TV. Gil looked up at me. The shrieking in the shed started up again, and I heard scratching and clawing coming from behind the house.\n\n\n\u201cSomething got out,\u201d I said. \u201cSomething got out of the shed.\u201d",

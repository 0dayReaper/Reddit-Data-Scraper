    "postText": "Have you ever woken up inside a school you don\u2019t remember going to?\n\nJetlag must have seriously had my ass. I\u2019m not sure where my mind had been wandering at that moment, though it must have been far across the galaxy because I found myself standing at a breakfast bar which could be likened to brunch from how elegant everything was. It wasn\u2019t jet lag. I knew the effects of jetlag, and I was pretty sure memory loss wasn\u2019t a symptom.\n\nPartial memory loss, because I could remember everything about myself and my life except how exactly I had come to be in this school. \n\nSeveral thoughts twitched in my head as I dragged my luggage, a bright pink suitcase, towards a table strewn with rich-people food. \n\nLooking around and drinking in my surroundings, I appeared to be in a school cafeteria. Private school, judging from everyone\u2014and my own\u2014uniform; a white shirt and plaid skirt with a blazer thrown over the top. \n\nIt felt weirdly comfortable, already bizarrely my size. Like I had worn it before. I wasn\u2019t sure why, but standing in that room gave me Deja-vu. I felt like I knew the mini water fountain stood proud in the centre. And the coffee-machine station near the entrance.\n\nI knew the exact combination of numbers to get an espresso and trick the machine into giving me another for free.\n\nI knew that bacon and maple sandwiches were popular\u2014and you had to fight for double chocolate chip brownies which were always gone first.\n\nExcept I didn\u2019t know this place. \n\nThis school was alien to me, and yet my memory was telling me otherwise. It was the first day jitters, I thought. Surely. Temporary memory loss existed, right? My aunt had hit her head during a confrontation with a mall-employee a few years ago. She forgot her name for a while, after falling headfirst into the fountain, not before cracking her head on cold marble. Though this was\u2026 different. How was it possible that I had completely forgotten not just my journey to the school, but choosing it, as well as saying goodbye to my parents. \n\nSo much was missing, and the more I was thinking about it, the progressively more panicked I was starting to become. \n\nThe room itself was huge, filled with small picnic-like tables to eat on, and a lounging area with beanbags and what looked like the latest games consoles. Wide windows looked out onto the school grounds where cherry blossom trees stood, groups of kids sitting in groups and spread out on their blazers and picnic blankets under a late afternoon sun. There were no lunch ladies or bland school food. I was looking at chocolate filled pastries, donuts and mini sandwiches and nibbles; baskets full of every soda I could think of, and a whole section at the end of the table with flavored, fizzy and scented bottled water. \n\nIt felt like dreaming, but when I reached forward and grabbed a toasted bagel and smeared it with cream-cheese, cramming it into my mouth, the food tasted real. I downed half  of a mimosa from a tray of them sitting on a golden platter\u2014and the drinks tasted real too. The only thing which patented this place to a fantasy were the students themselves. There were a group of them sitting closest to me. Four guys and two girls. They looked normal from first glance. \n\nI caught pieces of their conversation, something about a TV show they had all been watching. I had been watching one girl delicately put her sandwiches into a makeshift Jenga tower, when the guy next to her suddenly slammed his head into the table without warning. The impact made me cringe, the cream cheese bagel beginning to creep its way back up my throat.\n\nIt was\u2026 odd. The way he did it. It was during a conversation where he seemed reasonably okay, before lifting his head and slamming his face into his own plate of food. \n\nAfter several more times, and I was starting to see bruising around his right eye, his lips split, blood smearing his temples. This guy had done serious damage to his face and yet he didn\u2019t even seem to notice it himself. \n\nHe didn\u2019t notice the way his head twitched almost inhumanly to the side, his arms seemingly having a mind of their own. But he continued to smile and talk with the others who didn\u2019t react to him almost splitting his head open. The girl started laughing about something, and he joined in, unfazed by pooling red spurting from his nose and lips. He showed no signs of pain despite his body trembling under the table, and his shaky hands when he took a bite from his own sandwich.\n\nNone of them were commented on their spilled drinks or ruined lunches, or the amount of blood splattered on the table. I had half a mind to announce I would get the school nurse. But I had no idea where the nurse\u2019s office was. The rest of the cafeteria didn\u2019t even look his way, and the guy had definitely made noise. Half of his lunch was on the ground, and when I looked closer, there was an ugly crack in the hardwood table. Still though, no reaction from his friends who continued talking like their friend hadn\u2019t just given himself a mild concussion out of nowhere, quite literally speaking through blood staining his teeth and filling his mouth. I had found myself completely transfixed by this guy\u2019s pain endurance as he paid no attention to the state of his face, when another guy strode over to the brunch table, filling his plate with pastries and purple macarons.\n\n \u201cSooo, you\u2019re the new girl, huh.\u201d\n\nThe guy stood with his back to me, his attention on the food. I didn\u2019t blame him. It was practically a banquet. Wearing the same uniform, an untucked shirt over black pants, a loose tie, his blazer awkwardly hanging off his shoulder, he delved into the feast. I could tell from the fancy looking watch on his wrist, his parents had the kind of money he could throw away on several hundred. Though I couldn\u2019t speak from an outsider\u2019s perspective. My mother was the head of the board of education of our town, and my father had a high-paid job in the government. Not that I knew what it was. What I know is that it could give me a sheltered life. So, it\u2019s not like I was surprised I had ended up in this school. \n\nBut it was the why and the how which was confusing me. The boy\u2019s accent was refreshing in a room full of Americans, a cocktail of British and aussie. I could barely see his face, just a simple facial structure, as well as dark hair sprouting from a hat nestled over his head. Though I could just about make out Asian American features. When he turned to an awkward angle, he became more of a silhouette than a human being, late afternoon sunlight completely drowning his identity. \u201cYep.\u201d I said, keeping my eye on the boy who had surely given himself concussion. \n\nI was expecting him to collapse from blood loss, or maybe suddenly start screaming, becoming aware of the state of himself. It could have been a delayed reaction, which would explain his lack of attention.\n\nHowever, it didn\u2019t explain the other\u2019s. Who happily chatted with him, completely ignoring how much blood he was losing.\n\nI turned away from the food, intrigued, and slightly horrified by the guy who now appeared to be playfully flirting with the girl next to him. She had attracted my attention from the almost plastic look of her. If that was even the word. Everything about her was\u2026 shiny, and superficial. Her uniform was way too small for her, clinging to the perfect figure. Though it hugged just a little too perfectly, it looked like a squeeze to get on. Her hair was unbrushed, hanging in clumpy golden rat tails in front of her face, makeup scrawled over her face like a preschooler had used her face as their own personal canvas. \n\nA doll. The girl reminded me of one of my own abandoned dolls back at my mom\u2019s house. I stopped playing with dolls when I started middle school, but mom refused to throw them away. I found a box of them last summer, amused by the way I had treated them as a little kid. I had ripped and torn at their hair, drowned them in the kitchen sink, and given them \u201chair transplants\u201d with my mom\u2019s scissors. And that is what the girl reminded me of. One of my abandoned dolls.  Her appearance wasn\u2019t bothering anyone to my surprise. \n\nThis was a private boarding school for kids with parents with serious cash, and nobody, and I mean nobody, was commenting on the girl who looked like she hadn\u2019t showered in half a decade. The guy\u2019s nose had stopped bleeding, thank god. But I found it hard to believe the girl seemingly did not care. The two of them pretended to kiss, laughing with the others. When they embraced jokingly, he smeared blood all over her cheeks and lips\u2014which she didn\u2019t comment on. The girl didn\u2019t cringe or cry out. Her eyes were bright, lips pulled into a grin which was definitely flirting back.\n\nWas this school crazy, or was I?\n\n\u201cHellooo? I\u2019m talking to you.\u201d\n\nThe guy still wasn\u2019t facing me, picking his way through the food, side-stepping towards the chocolate fountain.\n\n\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d I found myself asking him.\n\n\u201cEaton Academy.\u201d He said. \u201cYou know, the school the elite send their bratty, misbehaving kids\u2014 also a dumping ground for kids they don\u2019t want anymore.\u201d He sighed, sniffing a mocktail and pulling a face. \u201cEspecially if they\u2019re divorced and can\u2019t even stand to look at each other. Mom disappears to some exotic location claiming its PR, while daddy ships you to boarding school.\u201d\n\nWell, that sounded personal.\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 why don\u2019t I remember coming here?\u201d\n\nThe guy stuffed a cupcake in his mouth. \u201cI dunno,\u201d he said, spraying crumbs. \u201cYou could be jetlagged\u2014or maybe you hit your head?\"\n\nHe finally turned to face me, and suddenly, I found myself unable to breathe. It wasn\u2019t his appearance, dark brown hair pinned by a pair of raybans, amused eyes drinking me in. No, it was something else; something I couldn\u2019t put a finger on or even reach out for. This guy had set all of my nerve endings on fire, and I didn\u2019t know why, or how. I knew what a crush was. The type of butterflies in your gut crush which twisted you from the inside out. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t a crush though. \n\nThis wasn't a romantic attraction, or a stupid crush. Instead of making my heart flutter, this guy\u2019s face was setting my body into fight or flight. It was just like the coffee machine, and the strange sense of D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu  I had felt inside the cafeteria. I knew this guy. I recognised the tinge in his accent. \n\nI knew that he hated purple macarons, but ate them because he liked to taste the artificial flavouring. That he hated horror movies, was a clumsy drunk, and despised his family for abandoning him.  But I didn\u2019t\u2026 want to know him. Something inside me wanted to get as far away from him as possible. It didn\u2019t make sense that I knew about him, I knew his face and accent, but I also didn\u2019t know him. The guy must have seen my expression, his brows furrowing. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d I lied.\n\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Abandoning his plate, he leaned against the table with his arms folded. \u201cSo, what do you go by?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\nHe rolled his eyes. \u201cDuh. Your name.\u201d\n\nMy attention flicked to another guy standing at the food table. This kid was more put together than the guy in front of me. Instead of the blazer, he wore white shirt and pants combo\u2014without a tie. His hair was tied back in a ponytail people like him could only pull off. Private school\u2019s birthed rich, attractive-looking students. \n\nThis guy was no exception. At first, I thought he was unsure what to get, before he lunged forward like an animal, stuffing food into his mouth. I watched him cram four cupcakes and six sandwiches, followed by chocolate coated strawberries and fruit pastries. He was making a mess, knocking the chocolate fountain over with trembling hands, before carving his fingernails into a whipped cream cake sitting on perfect silver. When he dropped to his knees and pillaged through a mountain of mini cupcakes, I started to feel nauseous. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t stopping. I watched him tear chicken directly from the bone and pour the whole bowl of potato salad into his mouth before moving onto every other food in his vicinity. It was almost animal-like. His eyes were blank as he sat on his knees, gnawing on crushed cupcakes and frozen yoghurt. \n\nHis lips were smeared with food, chin dripping with icing and potato salad, and chocolate and strawberry frosting. I looked around for someone to help him, for someone to tell him to stop\u2014but just like the guy who had slammed his head into the table multiple times, nobody seemed to notice. Even the Aussie kid still leaning against the table, didn\u2019t even glance at the boy who was starting to turn a shade of green I didn\u2019t know existed. I could see his body\u2019s reaction to the food, that it was trying to stop him, his stomach revolting. \n\nAnd he continued, his lips set into a pained grin. This wasn\u2019t normal. It was\u2026 inhuman. This kid was going to burst, I thought dizzily.  \u201cBecca.\u201d I managed to answer the Aussie\u2019s question. Something hit my face, sliding down my cheek. A wet piece of onion from the potato salad flying in every direction.  \u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026 wrong with him?\u201d\n\nThe Aussie frowned, his gaze flicking to the boy who was now sticking two fingers down his throat, forcing all the food back up which came out in an undigested sludge. His smile didn\u2019t disappear as he continued, grasping fistfuls of food and stuffing it into his gaping mouth. \u201cHuh?\u201d \n\nThe kid blinked, seemingly looking straight past the mess on the ground, and the feral-like state the ponytailed kid was in. Looking directly at me, his eyes seemed bright and alive, but looking closer, it was almost like there was a barrier in place stopping him from seeing what was going on. It was either that, or I was going fucking crazy, and was hallucinating some pretty fucked up shit. \u201cOh, that\u2019s Bulimia.\u201d He shrugged, smirking.  \u201cWhy? Do you like the look of him?\u201d\n\nHis words didn\u2019t make sense in my head\u2014and the name sounded like some kind of sick joke. In a school full of private school kids, I could understand name-calling. This, however, was a whole other level. Just like the boy who slammed his head into the table, and the girl who seemingly didn\u2019t know hygiene, nobody was noticing or commenting on them. \n\nI could see the blood vessels in the ponytailed kid\u2019s eyes starting to bulge and burst, rivulets of dark red seeping down his chin, joining the sludge of food. He let out what sounded like a choked sob, before reaching for another cupcake and forcing it into his mouth, already bulging a variety of sweet and savoury. I had seen hunger before. I had seen binge eating and even bulimia when I was a kid.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t it. This was way past an eating disorder. From the jerking way his hand was moving, twitching towards his mouth like a doll, it almost looked like his hands had a whole mind of their own. I felt sick to my stomach watching him, knowing from the look in his eyes, he was in pain, and he wanted to stop\u2014but he couldn\u2019t. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what did you just call him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d The Aussie almost slipped in the mess on the floor, though managed to keep his balance. \u201cOh, Bulimia? Well, that\u2019s his name.\u201d\n\nHe stuck out his hand with a grin. \u201cI\u2019m Hot Stuff.\u201d\n\nHis name took me off guard, and I almost laughed. I was being pranked\u2014surely. Though this was a little too fucking far for a stupid prank.\n\nI had to force myself to look away from the boy who had stopped eating once more, violently throwing up bloody mush behind me. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 what?\u201d I shook my head, struggling not to cry. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but are you not going to help that kid?\u201d\n\nHot Stuff inclined his head like I was the crazy one. Like I was the one slowly eating myself to death.  \u201cWhy?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cHe seems alright to me.\u201d He turned to the boy, amused eyes sparkling. \u201cYo. Bulimia. New girl wants to know if you\u2019re good.\u201d\n\nTo my confusion, the kid eating himself to death nodded with a laugh. \u201cYeah dude, I\u2019m good,\u201d he paused, lifting his head, and I had to avert my gaze before I threw up myself. I wasn\u2019t seeing food anymore. Instead, there was just blood pouring from his mouth. His body had rejected all of that food, and from the pallid look of his skin, he needed serious help. Even he, though, seemed unfazed by what he had done, instead shooting me a grin through pooling red. The boy got up, and stumbled out of the cafeteria. Even from a distance, I could still hear him violently tearing through another cupcake he\u2019d stuffed into his pocket. Hot Stuff watched him go with a blank look on his face and turned back to the ruined spread of food with a smile.\n\nA smile which seemed permanently glued to his face.\n\n\u201cSo, Becca!\u201d He spun on his heel, taking a bite of an apple. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d\n\n\u201cCleveland.\u201d I said, in a daze. I had so many questions, and most of them were threatening to come out in a shriek I wasn\u2019t sure I could control.  \u201cWas that guy okay? Did he go to the nurse?\u201d I had to swallow bouts of hysteria clawing for a way out.\n\n\u201cBulimia?\u201d Hot Stuff shrugged through a mouthful of apple. \u201cHe looked okay to me? Though I get it.\u201d He grinned. \u201cBulimia Is a good looking guy, I can see why you\u2019re interested, Becca.\u201d He inclined his head, his gaze finding the stain of red on teal green tiles. His eyes darkened for a moment, expression twisting. I thought he was going to snap out of this\u2026 trance everyone was in, forced to look through rose tinted glasses and blind to the reality around them. Instead, though, he shook his head and tipped his head back with a sigh. \u201cBuuuuut, I think our boy is taken. I\u2019m not sure by who, but yeah, he\u2019s probably spoken for.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d I said in a frustrated hiss. \u201cThat guy was\u2026 he was making himself sick\u2014and he didn\u2019t even seem to care,\u201d I gestured around the room. \u201cNone of you seem to care! Even you! Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s weird?\u201d I took a step towards him, and D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu sprung again. I had done this before. I had shouted at him before\u2014and he had pulled that exact same expression. \n\nAmused, with a smidge of pissed. I even somehow knew his reaction would be rolling his eyes and tipping his back with a groan. Shaking away intense feelings coming over me like ice-cold water, I let out a breath.  \u201cDid you even see him spewing his stomach lining? The guy was bleeding, and all of you\u2026 you just pretend it\u2019s not happening? How is that not seriously fucked up?\u201d Now that I had his attention, I couldn\u2019t stop myself. \u201cWhere are the teachers?\u201d I hissed out. \u201cI  don\u2019t even fucking remember coming here, there are zero teachers, and you\u2019re all acting like watching someone barf their insides out is normal!\u201d\n\nHot Stuff looked confused, again, like I was the crazy one. He opened his mouth to speak, before a voice rang out across the room, startling me.\n\n\u201cAttention!\u201d\n\nThe buzz of white noise and chatting around the cafeteria came to a sudden halt when the girl I had been watching earlier, who still had her boyfriend\u2019s blood all over her face, jumped onto a table, waving her arms to shut everyone up. And they did. As if she had some kind of hypnotic control over them, every face turned towards the girl.  Now that I was seeing her up close, this girl looked even worse. Her skin didn\u2019t look like\u2026 skin. It glistened artificial light. \nAlmost like I was looking at a real-life doll. \n\nSmiling widely like everyone else, with that same oddly blank look in her eyes, the girl started to talk about things I didn\u2019t care about\u2014because I was getting out. There was no way I was staying in a school where the entire student body just existed to be grinning, mindless robots who acted like NPC\u2019S.\n\nHowever, even when I was backing away slowly, ready to find the nearest exist, I couldn\u2019t help feeling a sense of dread coiling in my gut, stopping me from leaving. Slowly, I turned back to the girl who was talking about the cheerleading team needing more members, and there was a missing laptop reported by an underclassman. Hot Stuff was like everyone else, casually leaning against the brunch table, and smiling at the doll-like girl.\n\nIt was when her plastic-looking fingers went to her hair and began to tear it out, did my stomach start to twist itself into knots. She didn\u2019t just touch her hair, running her fingers through strands of fake-looking locks. Instead, the girl started to tug at her scalp, ripping out chunks of hair with a wide smile. It was when smeared red started to appear, first on her forehead, and then her neck and cheek, as she fisted handfuls of hair and tore it straight from her scalp, when I realized I was staring at an actual doll with human-like features. It wasn\u2019t just her arms and legs. Her face looked plastic. \n\nThe hair stained deep, dark red stuck between her fingers was fake. Not like hair extensions, like actual doll hair I had memories of tugging my Barbie brush through as a little kid. Something ice-cold crept down my spine. I was paralysed to the spot, watching her claw at her head until half of her hair was gone, what looked like shredded skin, something fleshy and pink caked under perfectly manicured nails. \u201cIs everyone excited to speak to Abigail tonight?\u201d She shouted out into her audience of transfixed faces.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t see it, I thought. Glancing at Hot Stuff, his expression wasn\u2019t even twitching as this girl ripped at not just hair, but her scalp, the tips of her fingers dripping scarlet. His head was cocked at an angle, lips forming a smile of appreciation.\n\nNot even the girl noticed what she was doing, continuing her speech about a pep rally they were all excited for.  I found my voice somewhere between stumbling into the brunch table, and falling to my knees, before diving back to my feet, every instinct telling me to turn and run away from what I had found myself stuck inside. I was still curious, however. \n\nPart of me wanted to know why splinters of me knew this school\u2014why I knew Hot Stuff, and why I was transfixed by this girl ripping herself apart in front of a silent mass of hypnotised kids staring at her like she was the second coming of Christ. \u201cWho is Abigail?\u201d\n\nI barely heard myself. I almost felt like I was speaking into a void, my voice more of a breathy murmur.\n\nHot Stuff\u2019s head whipped around suddenly, his lips twitching into a scowl. It was the way he moved, his expression darkening, which sent my heart into my throat. His voice was too loud, and the room had gone deathly silent. Hot Stuff\u2019s lips curled into a snarl. I could sense him stiffening up, his hands falling into fists. Almost territorial. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who Abigail is?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d I said in a breath, eyeing the exit. Because this guy had gone from dazedly smiling and trancelike, to feral animal in a matter of a second. \u201cI just got here.\u201d\n\nHis lips contorted into disgust, and before I could back away, he was grabbing my arm, and throwing it up. \u201cBecca wants to meet Abigail!\u201d \n\nHot Stuff jumped up and down like an excited kid. It took me a moment to realize it, a sudden, unexplainable agony curling my lips into a silent screech. But then I was staring down at the boy\u2019s fingers wrapped around my forearm\u2014and my flesh bubbling underneath it, my skin turned an unnatural shade of red. \n\nWith words I couldn\u2019t coerce choking on my tongue, I wrenched my arm away from him. The flesh of my arm was burned. Not just burned, it was charred, already melted through my blazer and shirt. The pain was nothing like I had ever felt before; vicious bolts of electricity singing my skin. I grabbed a bottle of water to douse my arm before another hand caught it. I lifted my head to find the doll-like girl standing directly in front of me. Her smile was too wide, her teeth far too white to be natural. \u201cDo you really want to meet Abigail?!\u201d\n\nShe spoke in a shriek, and the room of kids seemed to mimic her.\n\nI couldn\u2019t speak, my attention on my arm, and then Hot Stuff. He couldn\u2019t have been that hot, right? Not hot enough to burn straight through my skin!\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d The girl poked me in the forehead, and her finger felt like straight-up plastic. I fought against cringing away with every eye on me, including Hot Stuff, who\u2019s lip was curled.  \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d She frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen you before.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecca.\u201d I whispered, writhing in pain.\n\n\u201cHi Becca!\u201d The girl waved cheerily. \u201cI\u2019m Barbie!\u201d She leaned close to me, her breath tickling my ear. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to meet Abigail tonight!\u201d\n\nI got out of there fast. Hot Stuff\u2019s blank grin was driving me crazy. Every time I caught his eye, I wanted to know how exactly he had managed to do that to my arm. Though his unseeing eyes and lack of brain cells turned me off. Luckily, I did find a nurse\u2019s office with an actual adult who managed to clean me up and bandage up my arm. When I was sitting on an observation bed, swinging my legs, the woman was applying ointment, she tutted to herself. \u201cYou would not believe how many kids I have coming in here after spilling scalding coffee all over themselves,\u201d she chuckled. \u201cPlease take care when handling hot beverages.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t coffee,\u201d I whispered, \u201cIt was one of the guys.\u201d\n\nThe nurse straightened up, her lips twisting into a frown. She was pressing far too much pressure on my arm. I tugged away with a hiss. She apologised with a gentle smile.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, are you saying another student has thrown coffee all over you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I hissed out. \u201cHis hand!\u201d I leaned forward. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to tell you! He grabbed my arm, and I think\u2026 I think he burned my arm.\u201d Shaking my head, I hissed out a breath. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with them. These kids. They\u2019re crazy!\u201d\n\nShe hummed. \u201cDo you think he intended to hurt you?\u201d\n\nThe nurse wasn\u2019t getting it, and I couldn\u2019t be bothered trying to explain what I was sure had been a seventeen year old kid almost burning my flesh from the bone. When the nurse first saw it, she called an ambulance and told me I would be taken to an emergency room. Which never happened. I don\u2019t know if she forgot, or maybe she had some kind of memory loss, because she sent me to my room with a bag of candy and a bottle of water. \n\nI thought I\u2019d have trouble finding my room, though I found it easily, navigating the ancient and yet modern aesthetic of the school. The stairs to the girl\u2019s dorm were practically crumbling, but modern architecture made up the dorms themselves, wide windows and doors with mechanical locks on them. When I dragged my luggage through a fancy wooden door with an ornate handle, my stuff was already set up, my clothes in the wardrobe, all of my books and my comics stuffed into a shelf by the window. Even my laptop had been set up on my desk. \n\nI made a mental note to thank my roommate, a curly blonde, who was standing in the middle of the room staring at me like I had grown a second head. When I made a move towards her, she stumbled back, eyes widening with fright.  \n\nHer side of the room was strangely empty except for a blanket, some books, and one stuffed teddy bear sitting awkwardly on her pillows. It almost looked like she was the new girl. Ignoring her look of horror as I strode over to my bed and flung my luggage down, I plonked myself down on my comforter.  I shot her a smile. \u201cThanks for unpacking for me, but I\u2019m not staying here.\u201d\n\nThe girl frowned at me before hurrying over to her desk, grabbing a pen and a notepad, and scribbling something down, before holding it up.\n\nI'M SORRY, BECCA.  She wrote something else in a frenzied squiggle. \u201cI CAN\u2019T HELP YOU.\u201d\n\nSomething in my chest tightened. \u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d I whispered. \u201cDid someone tell you?\u201d When she lifted her knees to her chest, wrapping her arms around them, I couldn\u2019t stop myself asking the question nobody seemed to want to answer.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d I hissed out. \u201cThis school is psychotic. Why am I here? Why can\u2019t I remember coming here?\u201d\n\nThe girl looked torn for a moment before shaking her head. Instead of using the pen and pad, she took slow, stumbling strides towards me before opening her mouth. \n\nI thought she was showing me her perfect teeth at first\u2014teeth which were unnaturally white just like Barbie\u2019s. When I looked closer, though, I realized what she was pointing at with the tip of her index finger. My roommate didn\u2019t have a tongue. Or she did, but it was barely that of one, just a slither of something which had managed to hang on. Her tongue had been severed from the trauma in the back of her mouth. Yanked out. I think that was the point I thought fuck no. I wasn\u2019t staying there.\n\nI didn\u2019t even wait for my roommate to close her mouth. I\u2019m not sure how I got from A to B so fast, I think it was the adrenaline. I passed kids who smiled widely at me, and I wondered if their tongues were gone too. Once I was outside, however, my shoes treading on tarmac under my feet, in a dizzying and confusing flash of light, I was back in my room in front of my roommate. Now that I was looking at her, really taking her in, freckled cheeks and an oddly shaped nose, hair she was constantly tucking behind her ears because it always got in her face, I knew her too.\n\nShe held up her notepad and told me to stop\u2014told me there was no point. I didn\u2019t care. I tried again. And again. And again. Every single time, I barely managed to step over the threshold before I was back inside my room, screaming and clawing at my own hair in frustration. On my third or fourth attempt, I did manage to see a gate. An open gate. So, there was a way out. \n\nExcept every time my shoes touched the outside,  cool air grazing my face, I was exactly where I started. Sitting on my bed with a slowly building migraine. My roommate, who seemed the sanest out of everyone, handed me a bottle of water which I downed half of before throwing the bottle against the wall. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d I whispered in a shriek. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I get out of here?!\u201d  \n\nThe girl scribbled something else.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go to sleep tonight.\u201d\n\nShe shook her head. \u201cIf you go to sleep, you will join them.\u201d She drew a sad face, which made me feel maybe a fraction better.\n\nI grabbed a cushion off of my bed, squeezing it to my chest. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\nThe girl frowned. She wrote down, \u201cDid you forget?\u201d her expression seemed to change for a moment, her eyes turning hollow, which aged her way above seventeen. Tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, she scribbled over that, writing: \u201cMy name is Josie.\u201d\n\n\u201cJosie.\u201d I said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I fall asleep tonight?\u201d\n\nMy roommate\u2019s gaze found the ground before she hesitantly picked up her pad and pen.\n\n\u201cI already got my punishment.\u201d She had written, gesturing to her mouth. \u201cI spread a lot of false rumours, and\u2026.\u201d She hesitated, the pen on the paper. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I agree with my punishment. But I am glad I no longer have use of my mouth.\u201d\n\nThe twisted and contorted legs of a spider wriggled their way down my spine.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m better now.\u201d Josie wrote down with a smiley face. \u201cWe\u2019re all better now!\u201d\n\nI thought she was finished before Josie scrawled down something else, holding the notepad up, a smile curving on her lips. I recognised that exact gleam in her eyes. It had sparkled in Hot Stuff and Barbie\u2019s. Josie\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t quite blank, but I couldn\u2019t call them coherent. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to meet Abigail!\u201d  she wrote, her handwriting progressively harder to read\u2014like she had ignored her own warning. Josie spent hours writing to me about Abigail, though halfway through the hour mark, my roommate\u2019s writing became nothing but a confusing smear of black creeping across the page. I saw the same feral look twisted in her eyes, identical to the boy who had almost eaten himself to death, and Hot Stuff when I admitted I didn\u2019t know who Abigail was. \n\nThis was blindly worshipping someone I didn\u2019t even know. Josie didn\u2019t stop until the pen had run out, and she was using her fingernails instead. When I grasped at her hand and told her to stop, she shoved me back with strength I didn\u2019t know she had. \n\nSuffice to say, I did sleep that night. \n\nThere was nothing else to do but freak out and attempt to break out of the window which surprise, surprise, had bars on them. I wasn\u2019t sure when I fell asleep, but I woken up with a familiar scalding hot and clammy hand slamming over my mouth, gagging my screams. Hot Stuff. Next to him, to my surprise, was the boy with the ponytail, and Barbie. This time, his touch was blistering. When I screamed, he removed his hand, and ordered me to get out of bed.\n\nI did, falling face-first onto Josie\u2019s beaded rug. I was dragged to my feet, the three of them dragging me from my room. Before I could speak, a blindfold was wrapped around my eyes, and I had to bite back a shriek. Hot Stuff\u2019s fingers singed the back of my neck, his breath like steam, making me shiver. Stumbling in the dark, I fell twice, only to be tugged to my feet violently. Something about the way I was being pulled, my bare toes trailing across carpet, then wood, and finally freezing cold stone, sent waves of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu taking my mind once again. \n\nI knew this route. I knew the uncomfortable feeling of marble tiles on the soles of my feet. I knew my own stifled giggles as we attempted to hide from teachers on the prowl looking for kids sneaking out after curfew. Blinking through the blindfold, I knew the hypnotic glow of candles at the corner of my eye as we took slow steps in our descent. But all of these times locked in my memory, unreachable pieces of myself which had been torn away. I had been on the other side. \n\nI wasn\u2019t the person being dragged roughly, their trembling  hands bound behind their back with tough rope.\n\nI was the one dragging them.\n\nI had dragged multiple kids down these exact stone steps, laughing when they cried out for their mommy.\n\nWhen I was shoved onto my knees, the blindfold was finally tugged off. Candlelight hit my eyes. It was enough to transfix me, the warm glow bathing me, and everyone around me in a heavenly-like allure. \n\nAround me, I could sense them. Kids dressed in black on their knees. Next to me, Hot Stuff and Ponytail knelt, blank, heads tipped back, unseeing eyes glued to something... when I lifted my own head, I found myself staring at... gold. No, not just gold; a mountain of gold, silver, cash and riches, watches and anything of worth, anything tinted with diamonds, underneath a single swaying corpse pinned to the wall. \n\nIt was a girl. Or it had been a girl, her face wasn't much of a face, flesh peeling from her bones, lips stretched into a wide, skeletal grin. Abigail. Something inside my mind... snapped. I had been drowning in fog for the last several hours, stuck inside a school I didn't know with strangers bearing faces I did. When my gaze found Abigail, however, I knew exactly where I was. \n\nAnd I knew who she was. \n\nI knew who I was. \n\nThe deep crevices where her eyes had been burned into me, as my purged mind was given clarity. I saw a flash of Bulimia grasping hold of a flailing girl with wide, terrified eyes, and forcing food into her mouth, his lips cruelly twisted into a look of mania. \n\nWhen she did force down the food, he crammed another cupcake in her mouth, squeezing her nose so she was forced to swallow it down, her eyes filling with tears. Another flash, and this time I was seeing a classroom. Hot Stuff wielding a knife glowing orange, and pressing it to the girl's flesh, making her scream and cry out, trying to get away. But he just shoved her down, pressing harder until the burning blade was melting her skin. Barbie joined them, clawing at the girl's hair, a maniacal grin twisting her lips, drawing all over her face with eyeliner. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make you look sooo cute, Abbie! Like a doll!\u201d\n\nFinally, my last memory; a startling agony starting to build in my chest. Abigail sat on the edge of the well outside of the school grounds. Hot Stuff and Bulimia held her down. Barbie stood several feet away filming everything, with Josie next to her, giggling. This time it was my voice which sounded out. \"Do witches float? Let's see! Abbie, sweetie. If you sink, you're a witch. But! If you're innocent, you'll float! How does that sound, huh? Sound fun?\" Before she could open her mouth, I was thrusting my arms forwards, and shoving her into the dark, my own lips curved into a grin. \"Sink.\" I said with a laugh.\n\n\u201cSiiinkkkkk!\u201d Hot Stuff hollered, with the others joining in.\n\nAbigail reached out for me, grasping hold of the collar of my shirt, and something changed in her eyes, a glitter which made me stumble back.\n\n\"Get off of me!\u201d I shrieked, shoving her forwards. \u201cFucking witch!\u201d\n\nComing out of the memory, I knew exactly who these people surrounding me were, and I knew the power which had taken over them.\n\nHot Stuff was Roman, a Korean diplomat\u2019s son.\n\nBulimia. Cal, whose mother owned a well-known fast-food chain.\n\nBarbie. Mari. The mere presence of her family sent shockwaves through anyone brave enough to get to know her.\n\nBut\u2026 There was one person missing.\n\nI saw glimpses of him in the memory. When I had shoved the girl, I freaked out, trying to get one of them to help me. But they just laughed. Jared, my boyfriend, wrapped his arms around me and swung me around, the two of us laughing, entangled in a kiss. \u201cJust pretend it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he murmured into my ear, before shouting at the others. \u201cUnderstand? It was suicide.\u201d He pulled a cigarette from his pocket and lit it up, taking a drag. \u201cThe girl was never going to fit in here, anyway.\u201d\n\nJared.\n\nBlinking rapidly, I searched for him. Roman had quickly gotten to his feet after being handed something sitting on a velvet cushion, before dropping to his knees in front of Abigail\u2019s corpse. He started to chant in a low murmur, the others surrounding him joining in, their minds and bodies taken over.  When I crept towards him, trying to squint in the candlelight, I realized it was a head. Jared\u2019s head. \n\nI could still see hair sprouting from a decomposing skull. Which I had already seen snapped off of his body by a Cas, and Mari thrusting a gilded knife through his skull. I remembered screaming, and being dragged back, a knife pressed to my throat. And a promise by Abigail, spoken through Mari\u2019s lips which trailed across my neck in a kiss. At the corner of my eye, hundreds of threaded dolls with my classmates' faces stood against the wall. \n\nFour of them were torn limb from limb, blood like string pouring from their heads. \n\nShe would take a piece of me.\n\nLike I had taken a piece of her.\n\nThat promise was held, as once the chanting had stopped, I was forced onto a bed of stone, the cruel, cold blade of scalpel slicing into my flesh, my screams gagged by a hand which scalded my lips, sending my thoughts into a dizzying spiral of nothing. But I didn\u2019t fall asleep. Abigail didn\u2019t let me. Instead, I was forced to watch them delve into the meat of me, slowly, so I would feel everything, and take a chunk of me away. I saw it in their hands smeared in slithering red and glistening gore.\n\nWhen I woke up, screaming, back inside my dorm-room, I thought it was a nightmare.\n\nUntil my gaze found bloody sheets, and under my shirt, clumsy stitches barely holding my stomach together. When I blinked, there she was at the corner of my eye. Smiling that same skeletal grin. I tried to get out again, but I am stuck with her.\n\nI am stuck here with Abigail implanted inside of me. She is everywhere, and I can\u2019t escape.\n\nI know I am a bad person. I did something awful, and she is making me pay for it rightfully so. However, Isn\u2019t this going too far? How is it even possible to take control of the school like this? How can this girl have so much power over everyone\u2014and most importantly, why hasn\u2019t she killed me?  I don't even know how I can get an Internet connection. I knew she was weird. But this is way beyond anything I have even heard of.\n\nWitchcraft. But this isn\u2019t the type we caught Abigail doing.\n\nIt\u2019s different.\n\nDarker.\n\nI am a disgusting human being. \n\nBut. If you have anything. Literally anything. I am begging you. \n\nHelp us.",

    "postText": "You can read Part One here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13g1805/the\\_seven\\_rules\\_of\\_the\\_midnight\\_mall/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13g1805/the_seven_rules_of_the_midnight_mall/)\n\nA lot of you have asked to hear more about my experiences at The Midnight Mall, and so I thought I\u2019d let you know what happened next. Partially because I opened this can of worms and figure I owe it to you to close it\u2026but also because a few of you have tried to find out where the Midnight Mall is, and I cannot stress to you how superbly, extremely, ridiculously stupid of an idea that is. So, if my first experience didn\u2019t convince you, hopefully this one will.\n\nNow, where did I leave off\u2026?\n\nAh, right. I had just dragged my unconscious, heavily bleeding friend Mike out of a pet store with a strict *No Outside Food* policy when I bumped into someone.\n\n\u201cYou seemed to have caused quite the commotion little lady,\" the man said. \"Maybe I could be of some help.\u201d\n\nHolding onto Mike like a lifeline, I slowly twisted around. The first thing I noticed were the man\u2019s shoes. Those thick black combat boots probably saved my life. Running off adrenaline, my first impulse was to look up into the eyes of the man. But the dullness of his shoes caught my attention; they appeared to be somewhat new, but were already scuffed to bits. And what had caused those dark stains covering the tips?\n\nWith growing trepidation, my gaze darted from his boots to his dark trousers to the shiny security badge fastened to his lapel. *Security Badge.* That\u2019s when I remembered Rule No. 5: *The Security Guard makes his rounds between 1:30 and 2:00 a.m. If you happen to bump into him, do not make eye contact.* I swallowed, my mouth going cotton dry.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d the guard said. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d\n\nIt took me a moment to find my voice. Part of me wanted to turn tail and flee, but I knew Mike was running out of time, and even though he could be a bit of a jerk sometimes, I also knew he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do everything he could to help me in a situation like this. So, keeping my gaze level with the security guard\u2019s chest, I nodded.\n\n\u201cMy friend,\u201d I choked out. \u201cHe\u2019s hurt.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can see that.\u201d I flinched as the guard bent down, but he didn\u2019t try and meet my gaze. He appeared to be examining Mike\u2019s wounds. \u201cLooks like a nasty chimera bite. You didn\u2019t bring outside food into the pet store, did you?\u201d\n\nMy silence was answer enough.\n\n\u201cKids these days. Didn\u2019t you read the rules?\u201d he asked, his voice heavy with disapproval.\n\n\u201cYes, but\u2026\u201d I hesitated.\n\nBut what? But I forgot Mike had a few gummies in his pocket? That might have been true, but it wasn\u2019t the full truth. Because even if I had remembered, I don't think I would have done anything different. Not at the time. '*But I didn\u2019t think anything would actually happen'* was closer to reality. Only, I doubted that was what the guard wanted to hear.\n\n\u201cBut is it really the time for a lecture?\u201d I asked instead. \u201cYou said you could help, and I don\u2019t know how much time Mike has. He's literally bleeding out in front of you!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d the guard sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll have to call the janitor.\u201d\n\nAlthough I knew better than to look him in the eyes, the guard must have seen how red my face was turning, because with a low grumble, he whipped a notebook out of his pocket and scrawled something down.\n\n\u201cFine. I\u2019ll take it from here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just focus on getting out of here before the night\u2019s end.\u201d\n\nThen he pressed a little black button on his belt and proceeded to reach down for Mike. For a moment, my grip tightened.\n\n\u201cWait.\u201d\n\nThe guard ignored me, lifting Mike out of my hands as easily as if he were a loaf of bread \u2013 and breaking my hold like I was one of those disposable ties wrapped around the loaf. I grabbed onto his bicep and tugged, dizzy with panic.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d I repeated. \u201cWhat are you going to do with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can save him. But I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut where are you going?\u201d I asked. I hated the desperate shrillness in my voice; if Mike had been conscious, he would have laughed at me and told me that I sounded like the first girl to die in a B-list horror movie. \u201cWhere are you taking him?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomewhere you don\u2019t want to follow,\u201d the guard said. And although it was hard to gauge without looking up at his expression, I thought he sounded almost sympathetic.\n\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t just leave him. That\u2019s my friend,\u201d I said, dumbly. \u201cThat\u2019s my best friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll do everything I can to help him,\u201d the guard said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like you said \u2013 he doesn\u2019t have much time. And while I\u2019m happy to continue our conversation, he might not like that so much.\u201d\n\nI bit my lip. How could I argue with that logic? Easy answer: I couldn\u2019t. Instead, I watched as the security guard disappeared into the crowd, leaving nothing of Mike behind but a trail of his blood. So much damn blood\u2026could a person really live through something like that?\n\nLost in my morbid thoughts, I stayed rooted in place, staring numbly forward. It wasn\u2019t until I heard a wet squelching sound behind me that I came back to my senses. There was an elderly janitor mopping the blood off of the floor, his expression exhausted.\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019s a nasty spill,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYeah. Um, sorry about that\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d be able to lend a hand, would you?\u201d the janitor asked, rubbing his lower back.\n\nHe gave me a pitiful, hopeful look. He had the exact appearance of a kind elderly neighbor, and if I hadn\u2019t remembered Rule Number Six (*if the janitor asks for your help cleaning up a spill, politely decline*) I would have given in without thinking. Only, I did know the rules. And knowing the rules, I was able to look a fraction deeper than his surface expression.\n\nAnd underneath that sweet, cajoling look was a world of hunger. The janitor was famished.\n\nFor what? I\u2019m not sure. But I have the feeling that had I helped him, I would have found out immediately.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I murmured. \"I'm a little busy.\"\n\nI hesitated, half-waiting for something heinous to happen to me, but the janitor just rolled his eyes and went back to mopping, grumbling about the youth and their lack of work ethic. My eyes fluttered shut in relief, and I gave myself a mental pat on the back. Things were finally starting to calm down. Mike was with someone who could help him \u2013 at least, that\u2019s what I told myself, what I needed to believe \u2013 and I was starting to acclimate to the Midnight Mall\u2019s rules. Although the past hour had been harrowing, I would make sure that I didn\u2019t make any more mistakes.\n\nBut that\u2019s when I realized: it wasn\u2019t me I had to worry about. I straightened up with a jolt. Remy and Carter! Shit. I had been so focused on Mike, I had almost forgotten that Remy and Carter were still somewhere in this demented place. No, not somewhere. I knew exactly where they were.\n\nPraying that they were still in their seats, I hightailed it toward the movie theater.\n\nThe mall was loud with the sound of shuffling footsteps, shrieks of laughter, and vendors hawking their goods at cluttered kiosks, but I tuned it all out, my mind in a daze. I only noticed the noise when I burst into the lobby of the movie theater, and realized that everything had gone utterly silent.\n\nI slowed to an uneasy stop. The scent of freshly buttered popcorn wafted through the room, filling me with a sense of nostalgia and safety. But like the rest of the mall, there was something uncanny about this place. The linoleum floors were a tad too shiny, that popcorn scent a little too perfect. Not to mention, the lobby was completely abandoned. Not a soul in sight.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not selling tickets anymore.\u201d\n\nI hadn\u2019t made it a step past the ticket kiosk when someone slunk out from behind the popcorn machine. The sudden movement made me gasp, although the employee who emerged looked innocuous enough. She was a young woman around my age, and her diamond nose ring and dyed hair made her appear comfortingly familiar. A woman from my own time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking for a ticket,\u201d I explained. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to find my friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if you want to get inside, you need a ticket,\u201d the woman said, her voice bored. \u201cAnd like I said, we\u2019re not selling those anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I have to. Please. It\u2019s urgent!\u201d I explained. \u201cMy friends, Remy and Carter \u2013 they came here to watch a movie earlier and I have to make sure they\u2019re okay. It\u2019s our first time here, and I\u2019m worried that they\u2019re not taking this place seriously. That they think it\u2019s a joke. But I know it\u2019s not a joke, because our other friend Mike, he\u2026well, he\u2026he\u2026\u201d\n\nMuch to my shame, that\u2019s when I started crying. And not a few dainty tears either. No. I was full on ugly sobbing in the middle of the movie theater lobby, my shoulders shaking, my voice trembling, and my eyes a glaring red from a combination of the crying and the edibles. It was strange. I had kept it together during Mike\u2019s mauling, but now that I wasn\u2019t in any immediate danger, I was like a faucet with no tap. And although I knew I looked fucking pathetic, I couldn\u2019t stop the torrent.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s what made the woman take pity on me.\n\n\u201cOh, hey now. Don\u2019t cry\u2026\u201d she said, patting my back awkwardly, suddenly looking more out of place than me. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what if one of my friends left the theater?\u201d I asked through a horrific combination of snot and tears. \u201cWhat would happen to them?\u201d\n\nThe woman \u2013 who I had started to think of solely as Nose Ring \u2013 tugged at her pink bangs. \u201cWell, the cinema would sort them out,\u201d she said. \u201cBut let\u2019s not think about that. Look. The movie started at 12:45 and it'll be done by 2:45. It\u2019s 2:30 now. That\u2019s only fifteen minutes you have to wait. You can do fifteen minutes, can\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nI licked my dry lips, uncertain.\n\n\u201cYou can do fifteen minutes,\u201d Nose Ring repeated, a command this time. \u201cBecause, no offense, but if you\u2019re this worried about your friends leaving before the movie ends, you wouldn\u2019t want to know what happens to the people who go inside without a ticket. Now, have a seat and stay there,\u201d she instructed, pointing at a stool. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n\nTrue to her word, the woman left and came back a moment later with a large soda. She instructed me to drink.\n\n\u201cThe sugar will help with your nerves.\u201d\n\nI did as she said, relieved to have someone else telling me what to do. In the span of a minute or two, I had gulped down half the cup.\n\n\u201cThere,\" she said. \"That better?\u201d\n\nI nodded, surprising myself. The soda was cool and refreshing, and although it didn\u2019t make everything better, somehow the act of focusing on something as mundane as drinking through a straw calmed me. I felt a little more in control of the situation, and a lot more embarrassed about my reaction.\n\n\u201cYeah. Thank you. And sorry about before.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Nose Ring shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve been working here for years now. You get used to it.\u201d\n\nYears? I looked her up and down. She looked like a senior in high school; how young did this place recruit? Only, before I could ask Nose Ring that question, or any of the other hundred that were now coming to mind, there was a crackling sound, and a voice came through a walkie-talkie on her belt.\n\n\u201cClean up needed in Auditorium 2. Do you copy?\u201d\n\nNose Ring wrinkled her nose. She looked like she was maybe thinking about ignoring the summons, but when the walkie-talkie buzzed for a second time, she sighed.\n\n\u201cCopy that,\u201d she said. She glanced at me. \u201cI have to go take care of something. Will you be okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks again, um\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cTrish.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks Trish.\u201d\n\nNose Ring \u2013 I mean, Trish \u2013 gave me an awkward pat on the shoulder before hurrying off. I glanced at the clock on the wall. 2:40 a.m. Just five more minutes to go. I could do this.\n\nThat's why I was surprised when only a few moments had passed when I heard a creak from around the hall. A door opening. I twisted around and saw a small crowd trickle out from the auditorium. There were only about five or six people, and I spotted Remy at the forefront. When I waved, she made a beeline towards me.\n\n\u201cRemy! I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re okay,\u201d I said, looping my arms around her neck and pulling her close. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what I\u2019ve been through. This place \u2013 you were right. It\u2019s not normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust me. I know,\u201d Remy said.\n\nAnd that's when I noticed her expression. My stomach dropped.\n\nAlthough Remy was the most risk adverse out of all of us, she also sported the best poker face. She had grown up with three older brothers who teased her mercilessly about most everything, and because of this, hiding her true emotions had become a basic instinct for her. But now? Well, now she looked scared. And if Remy looked scared, then she must actually be terrified.\n\nA bad feeling swirling in the pit of my stomach, I craned my head around the ticket counter, gazing down the hall and towards the auditorium. But although there were still more people trickling out, I didn\u2019t see Carter anywhere.\n\n\u201cRemy, where\u2019s Carter?\u201d\n\nBut Remy just shook her head.\n\n\u201cRems?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to get out of here,\u201d she said, ignoring my question. \u201cCome on.\u201d\n\nWithout waiting for an answer, Remy seized my hand and dragged me out of the movie theater. She moved so fast that I had to jog to keep up; we were halfway to the mall\u2019s exit before I came to my senses. I snatched my hand back, forcing Remy to pause.\n\n\u201cWait, slow down a second,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time to explain. We have to leave. Now.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Remy! Wait! We can\u2019t just leave \u2013 \u201d\n\n\u201cThe hell we can\u2019t. Come on, Kiera! This place is a mad house. It\u2019s a steel trap dressed in pretty colors, and you\u2019re shuffling around like bait. Now let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nShe grabbed my hand again and attempted to yank me towards the door, but I dug my heels into the floor.\n\n\u201cMike and Carter are still somewhere inside,\u201d I argued. \u201cAnd you haven\u2019t even heard about what happened to Mike. He was attacked, Remy \u2013 fucking mauled by some nightmare creature. I don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s alive. And what about Carter? Jesus, Remy. We can\u2019t just abandon them!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be a bitch. What happened to Mike and Carter is awful \u2013 but if we don\u2019t get out of here, we\u2019re going to end up just like them. Is that what you want?\n\nI hesitated. Part of me was so loyal to the Frightful Four that I wanted to scream at Remy for even suggesting such a thing. But Remy had always been the most sensible of all of us. When she argued for something, nine times out of ten, she was in the right. And as much as I hated to leave Mike and Carter behind, I didn\u2019t want to forfeit our own lives, either.\n\nSensing my indecision, Remy clutched my hands in her own and stared into my eyes, her expression softening.\n\n\u201cPlease, Kiera. Please come with me. It\u2019s already 3 am. I know it sounds harsh, but we don\u2019t have much time left, and I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m so scared Kiera. I\u2019m fucking terrified.\u201d\n\nHer voice was thick with fear, raw with vulnerability. And it was that more than anything else that finally did it.\n\nFinally made me realize, I mean.\n\n\u201cRemy would never admit to being scared.\u201d\n\nHeart pounding, I took a single step away from the thing calling herself Remy. Or, at least, I tried. But she was still clutching my hands in her grip. A grip that grew increasingly harsh, pressing down on the fragile bones in my hand until\u2026*crack.*\n\nA whimper escaped me. The Remy imposter chuckled, pleased with my pain.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. The one you call Remy hid her emotions very well,\u201d she said. She leaned in closer to me, her blunt teeth snapping next to my earlobe. \u201cWhich made it all the more satisfying to collect her screams.\u201d\n\nShe gave me an appraising, hungry look. Then she smiled. \u201cBut your screams? Oh, I can already tell  they\u2019re going to be divine.\u201d\n\nAnd then, gripping my broken hand like a vice, the Remy Imposter pushed me towards the exit.",

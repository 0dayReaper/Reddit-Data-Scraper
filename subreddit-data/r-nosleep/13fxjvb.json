    "postText": "You ever get that burning desire to share something? To just get it out of your head by any means possible? To just talk about it and fucking be over with it? Well this is my attempt to finally be able to bear what happened when I was a kid.\r  \n\r  \nI used to live in a small town, in the middle of fucking nowhere. Whose fucking idea was it to build a fucking town in the middle of some fucking forest in the middle of fucking nowhere I have no fucking idea, but fuck that dude. Due to his GIANT BRAIN I\u2019ve not been able to sleep properly for more than 12 years. \r  \n\r  \nPardon my French, were it not for cussing I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve retained whatever small bits of sanity I have left.\r  \n\r  \nBut I digress\u2026 Ever since I was a kid there\u2019s been one story I never understood nor shook off. It was common to scare us into following whatever rules our parents had. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cEat your vegetables or the boogeyman will get you!\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cBehave or the old witch will steal you away and make soup of you!\u201d\r  \n\r  \nStupid shit like that. That worked on you when you were 10. Maybe up to 13 or if you were really fucking stupid up to 15. \r  \n\r  \nBut there was one story. It wasn\u2019t a story to scare us. It wasn\u2019t your usual fear tactic. The story itself wasn\u2019t even scary at all. It was a cautionary tale. \r  \n\r  \nIt is the story of the spindly pale man in the woods. \r  \n\r  \nMy mother told it to me once I started playing out until late in the forest with the other kids. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cListen sweetie,\u201d \u2013 One day she called me and sat me down. \u2013 \u201cI need you to promise to come home before the sun sets and not to play in the woods when it\u2019s dark or else the spindly man will get you and take you away.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cThe what with the what?\u201d \u2013 My immature, witty \u2013 or so I used to think at the time \u2013 16-year-old ass retorted without so much as a second thought\u2026 or a first for that matter\u2026\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThis town is built on top of the home of the spindly man. He lived here long before any of us. Long before this town was even built. But one-day people just destroyed his home and banished him into the woods. Abandon and long forgotten he bears unspeakable hatred for us. For the people who live in this town. And he would use any chance he gets to hurt us. In the worst ways imaginable. So I need you to promise me that you will not be outside after the sun has set. Not in the woods at least.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nLike I said the story itself isn\u2019t anything much. But the look on my mother\u2019s face when she spoke. I didn\u2019t give a shit about an old creep in the woods. I just didn\u2019t want to cause any trouble for my mother so I agreed. \r  \n\r  \nNow you cannot blame me \u2013 my at the time stupid self \u2013 for being frustrated and stubborn that I cannot play in the woods in the most thrilling hours of the day, but I can. Oh I alone can blame myself like no one else can. I can blame myself for not being more than the sum total of my urges and hormones\u2026\r  \n\r  \nAs I got to leave she continued speaking.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSweetie before you go I need you to imagine the spindly man so I know that if you happen to see him you\u2019ll run away.\u201d \u2013 She was talking as she was looking for something. \u2013 \u201cI need you to imagine a tall and pale man. A very old, weak and withered old man.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nShe found what she was looking for. Pencil and an A4 list of paper. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cDraw him for me please.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cUhh\u2026 Sure.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAnd I did. I drew the most half assed slender man I could think of. But she wouldn\u2019t have it. I drew it over and over again, until finally I drew an old withered man. Weak and tired and fragile. And old so old he\u2019d collapse under his own weight at any moment. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cPerfect.\u201d \u2013 the worried look my mother had was now gone. She hung the drawing on the fridge and I hurried to the door to go outside to play when I heard it.\r  \n\r  \nAn otherworldly shriek that came from deep in the woods. It was as if the thing that made the sound was deep in agony and misery. But even more the resentment was evident. \r  \n\r  \nTime passed quietly and peacefully. But as it is with every other fucking thing this one too was temporary. \r  \n\r  \nWhen I was 16 and hanging out with my usual group, that consisted of about 12 other morons my age, one of those dipshits had the brightest idea. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we drive the old creep away?\u201d \u2013 Billy thought out loud. \r  \n\r  \nEveryone looked at him simultaneously, as if rehearsed. Not to bask in his bravery or to compliment the size of his brain, but because it was such a simple idea. And no one knew why we hadn\u2019t done it earlier. Needless to say everyone was on board. \r  \n\r  \nThis is where shit gets really bad, fuck my hands are shaking just trying to remember the events\u2026 But I need to get it out of me. It\u2019s been eating me from the inside for too long now. \r  \n\r  \nAll the promises we had made to our parents were broken. We made a plan. Get a weapon and meet back at sunset at the exact same spot. \r  \n\r  \nAnd that we did, well most of us anyway. About 8 of us showed up. But we thought it enough, after we made notes of who didn\u2019t show up \u2013 to insult their cowardice on the next day \u2013 we set off in the forest. \r  \n\r  \nAs a group the newly introduced, due to puberty, testosterone made us feel invincible. Have you ever been in a group with a lot of other guys and felt how the most primal part of you was begging to be let out? In today\u2019s age it\u2019s mostly behaving like a couple of deranged monkeys, screaming and jumping, bumping around. But thousand years ago that fueled the march of armies. When men gathered an army was made. \r  \n\r  \nWe had our little army. \r  \n\r  \nSadly, none of us were even remotely close to being called men and I mean men in the moral sense of the word. A brave and well composed individual capable of keeping his cool under the worst of situations. No were just a bunch of spoiled kids that had never struggled for anything. Our town was rarely if ever visited and everyone knew everybody so crime was little to none. Our illusion of being invincible and strong and brace would soon be shattered into a million pieces. \r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s just as this old saying goes.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, and weak men create hard times.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nWe were the weak little men, who marched into the forest. Unaware of the horror about to be unleashed upon us. \r  \n\r  \nOur advance was accompanied by the chirping of birds, the sounds of bugs buzzing about, occasionally a bat would fly by, we even spotted few foxes and couple rabbits on our descent into the depths of the woods.\r  \n\r  \nWe kept going deeper and deeper. The lights from the city growing smaller and fainter with each step we took. Every now and then someone would walk into a spider web and scream in fear and get laughed at. Or someone trip on a branch and fall in the mud. Our flashlights were of help, but not that much.\r  \n\r  \nBefore long Timmy, a not so tall and skinny fat nerd with a bowl cut and green eyes, said something that sent cold chills down my spine. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cGuys stop.\u201d \u2013 He said in a shaky voice.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat are you chickening out already?\u201d \u2013 Blake exclaimed, getting a few chuckles from others near him.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNo, you dipshit. Shut up and listen.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nThat we did. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cTo what. The sound of silence?\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cYeah dude. There\u2019s nothing. What\u2019re you scared of?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cExactly.\u201d \u2013 Said Timmy in an even more trembling voice. \u2013 \u201cWhen we entered the forest there was a barrage of sounds and life around us. What about now?\u201d\r  \nHe was right. There were no sounds coming from the forest. And that normally means only one thing. That there\u2019s a predator nearby. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s like everything went to hide somewhere.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cI think we should head back, we\u2019ve seen nothing and we\u2019ve been walking for quite a while. If we keep going we\u2019re bound to get lost. I say we call it a day and head back while we can still see some of the lights and know in which direction home is.\u201d \u2013 No one interjected so I continued. \u2013 \u201cIn the end it was just another creepy story to keep us in check.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nEveryone agreed with me and we started to march back. In the direction of the town lights. They looked so small in the distance, like fireflies frozen in space. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cGuys, where\u2019s Jake?\u201d \u2013 Jimmy, Jake\u2019s little brother, asked while looking around. \u2013 \u201cI swear he was right beside moments ago.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cStop fucking around and trying to scare us, it\u2019s not going to work you guys.\u201d \u2013 Jessica said, the only girl that came with us on our stupid endeavor to catch an old creep. \r  \n\r  \nWe started calling for Jake and shining our flash lights in every direction. When a loud crunch about 30ft from us was heard. In the eerie silence that crunching of branches was like a bomb being dropped. \r  \n\r  \nSimultaneously we all shone our lights in the direction of the noise. Only to freeze in place after doing so. \r  \n\r  \nThe was an unnaturally large pale head sticking out of the side of one the trees. \r  \n\r  \nThe tale that my mother told me couldn\u2019t have been further from the truth. It was impossibly tall. Withered by time with long bony arms that ended in sharp knife-like fingers, long and spindly legs. But it\u2019s head was the worst. It\u2019s eyes 2 gaping black holes hungrily devouring all light. \r  \n\r  \nIt started to murmur something whilst showing us it\u2019s grotesque toothy grin. When it opened its mouth to speak something fell out of it. When the object came to a halt it turned out to be Jake\u2019s head.\r  \n\r  \n\\[It has been so long since I\u2019ve devoured one of your kind.\\]\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s not real. It can\u2019t be real. It\u2019s not real. It can\u2019t be real. It\u2019s not real.\u201d \u2013 Jessica kept repeating.\r  \n\r  \nSeveral kids took off running. I was frozen in place, Billy who had a crush on Jessica was doing his best to deny his urge to take off as well. Jimmy was still there as well. In shock of seeing his brother\u2019s head roll near his feet. He was crying and screaming hysterically calling for his mom. While I couldn\u2019t move. \r  \n\r  \nFight or flight? Freeze it was. I couldn\u2019t move an inch.\r  \n\r  \n \u201cIt\u2019s not real. It can\u2019t be real. It\u2019s not real. It can\u2019t be real. It\u2019s not real.\u201d \u2013 Jessica was still screaming, head in her knees, eyes shut tight and ears covered she wouldn\u2019t stop repeating that same sentence over and over \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s not real. It can\u2019t be real. It\u2019s not real. It can\u2019t be real. It\u2019s not real.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nIt stared at Jessica with raw and obscene desperation. It screamed and charged at her, but couldn\u2019t reach her and as it anger reached its peak, it let out the loudest shriek I have ever head.\r  \n\r  \nBilly had no chance of getting her to stand up and run. It let out another shriek and charged with ungodly speed towards Billy. \r  \n\r  \nIt dismembered him almost instantly. One moment Billy is there pipe in hand, the next Billy is in 4 different places at the same time. \r  \n\r  \nThat was what broke me out of my trance. Billy didn\u2019t even get to scream. My legs started moving on their own as I started gaining speed. I kept running without stopping or looking back. \r  \n\r  \nJessica\u2019s voice rapidly fainting. I heard Timmy scream which was quickly cut off. That made me run even faster.\r  \n\r  \nMy legs burned. Like someone had poured gasoline and lit them on fire, but I dared not slow down. \r  \n\r  \n\u2018FASTER. FASTER.\u2019\r  \n \r  \nI screamed in my mind. \r  \n\r  \nI ran so fast everything blurred together. Luck however was on my side as I didn\u2019t smash my head against any trees or break either of my ankles if I were to trip or anything. I ran and ran and then ran some more until I reached my house. Went shoulder first into the front door and ran straight into my room where I collapsed on the floor.\r  \n\r  \nNext thing I remember I woke up in a hospital.\r  \n\r  \nDoctor\u2019s telling me I slept for 2 days and I\u2019ll need a week rest until I can walk properly again. Turns out the sudden full sprint was enough to almost tear a muscle, but I was extremely lucky again. \r  \n\r  \nThe police questioned me. Many times. Turns out that me and only 2 other kids made it out. We were 8. One of them was Jessica. They had found in her in the woods still repeating her sentences. \r  \n\r  \nAnd anytime I mentioned the spindly man everyone said the same.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cit\u2019s not real. You need to tell me what really happened to your friends.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMonsters don\u2019t exist.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nNo one believed me. And I had nothing else to tell them, but repeat the tragic events that transpired over and over again. To get the same answers. Over and over. Like a broken record repeating itself. \r  \nThere were search parties in the woods. Only during the day. Trying to find the others. I told them it\u2019s pointless. They couldn\u2019t recover anything even barely recognizable to bury. Only parts. Limbs and torn clothes, guts\u2026 \r  \n\r  \nTime passed. Wounds were never healed and everyone always gave me the side eye. I lost all my friends and my family barely talked to me anymore. I had lost everyone\u2019s trust. \r  \n\r  \nThen one day something strange happened. There was a newcomer in town. Some guy had heard about the incident and came to investigate. He wasn\u2019t from the government, but he did seem quite well financially and dressed the part as well. \r  \n\r  \nRumors spread quickly and the whole town quickly started to hate him. \r  \n\r  \nOne day I was coming home from school, I was detained for something I didn\u2019t do, but the resentment they bore for me had still not worn out. So I waited it out and was going home just before sunset, when I saw that the new guy was unloading stuff from his car near the edge of the woods. It piqued my interest and since I had nothing else to do anyway I decided to follow him. \r  \n\r  \nAt this point I thought that the spindly monster would be the better way to go than to endure this banishment and solitary treatment from everyone around me. So I kept my distance and followed behind the mysterious man.\r  \n\r  \nHe was built like a unit. From a distance I\u2019d guess he was about 6\u20195. He wore tactical equipment and a huge bag over his shoulder. \r  \n\r  \nHe walked for not more than few minutes when he came to a stop and I also noticed something else. It was like a barrier. The life in the forest stayed near the edge. If you were to dive deep into the woods all sound disappeared. So I stayed as far back as possible. I was still able to hear things near me which reassured me of my safety. \r  \n\r  \nI watched as the man unpacked what looked to be a machine gun and a sword. \r  \n\r  \n\u2018A monster hunter.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI thought. \r  \n\r  \nHe didn\u2019t need to look for long though, the spindly man had already noticed him. I was again extremely lucky and I was able to observe everything from my safe heaven, near some forest life \u2013 so I knew if the animals and bugs were feeling safe so was I.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cShow yourself. There\u2019s no need to hide. I know you are there. Whatever you are.\u201d \u2013 The mysterious man said in a deep and confident voice. \r  \n\r  \n\\[Why have you come human?\\] \u2013 The same ancient voice filled with malice filled my ears.  \r  \n\r  \n\u201cTo ask you on a date.\u201d \r  \nThe creature remained silent observing the man. \r  \n\r  \n\\[Was that some attempt at what your kind calls humor?\\]\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI guess time really did eat you away.\u201d \u2013 He sighed and continued in a serious tone. \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m here for answers. I\u2019ve been looking for one of your kind for a long time, but you\u2019re the first I ever get to see with my own eyes. The rest of your brethren has faded too much for me to be able to see.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe creature growled. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cDo not mistake me with the infantile bunch of kids you took out. I am not your average man.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\\[That I can see, it is not often that one marches to his own painful death.\\]\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYet you did.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe creature was taken aback by the retort.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOnly if you refuse to answer me though. I will make you a deal.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI will give you your former existence if you help me.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\\[You dare speak to me with such insolence you worm.\\] \u2013 the creature bellowed as it charged at the man with the same otherworldly speed, but this time the outcome was completely different. \r  \n\r  \nI squeezed my eyes shut, fearing the scene about to be unfolded, but when I opened them it was something else entirely. The creature\u2019s arm had been cleanly severed near it\u2019s elbow. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cI told you once already. Do not make me repeat myself demon.\u201d \u2013 The man continued. Anger now seeping into his voice like hot venom. \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re just a shell of what you\u2019ve once been so do not try this again or it will be you who dies a painful death.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nIts face grew paler than it was. Which was almost impossible. It was afraid of the man standing before it. Good, I thought. I wanted it to feel fear, to feel the pain it caused others. \r  \n\r  \nBut it only stared at its arm not even flinching. \r  \n\r  \n\\[Is today the day this shame finally comes to an end. Will you grant me the release I have so wished for, human?\\]\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAnswer my questions foul creature. The first one: Are any ancient ones still roaming the Earth?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nIt eyed him for a moment before speaking.\r  \n\r  \n\\[Yes.\\]\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhere? Tell me the location of the most weakened one.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAgain it stared at him before continuing with that voice that filled your head.\r  \n\r  \n\\[It is near \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. The land that your kind calls \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\]\r  \n\r  \n\\[How is it that you know of the ancient ones, human?\\]\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSo there are still some left of the ancient ones\u2026 Good. As you know it well yourself the veil grows weaker and weaker with each passing day and there are things only the ancient ones know, forgotten and forbidden truths that will help me prepare for the upcoming war.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\\[Seeing as how I\u2019ve answered your questions. It is time you held up your end of the bargain.\\]\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThe power of denial.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAt those words the monster flinched. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cThe idea that humans can deny the existence of the beings that exist in the realm beyond our own. The astral world. Not the idea rather the illusion. I still fail to comprehend how being of unimaginable knowledge, abilities and power would succumb to such ludicrous and foolish concept. It is not \u2018human denial\u2019 is your own power used against you. Because of the powers your kind possess the only way to defeat you is to use you against you. In other words, it is you that denies your own existence. It is you that makes you fade away.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNow you foul shell I need you to remember what you used to be. Your former glory and shake off any belief that human denial has any power over you. Remember and believe that you are your former self.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cThen know it.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWhy was this bastard helping the demon? Does he not know of the heinous acts it has done? \r  \nWhy? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?\r  \n\r  \nThe change wasn\u2019t noticeable at first, but the being started to gain in size. It\u2019s hands no longer resembled bones, now there was some muscle around them.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNow I need you to know that the manmade weapon cannot harm you.\u201d\r  \n \r  \nWhy was he helping it?\r  \n\r  \n\u201cEither know it or make it so or you will die.\u201d \u2013 He said as he lifted his sword above his head and swung.\r  \n\r  \nA metallic clank echoed as the blade of the sword broke and fell several feet away from them.\r  \n\r  \n\\[Why are you doing this human? You know I could just decide to kill you and you know of the acts I have done against your kind so why are you helping me regain my power? Knowing that I will take vengeance on the people of this town who\u2019ve tortured me for centuries.\\]\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSee I like to believe that I am not human, maybe I wear human skin in this life. But I would like to know that I am more than a biological puppet trapped in a limited vessel.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nIt let out a hoarse laugh.\r  \n\r  \n\\[Then I shall know it as well.\\]\r  \n\r  \n\u201cGood.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\\[I will grant you a day to flee this town before I enact my vengeance. If you are here by the end of tomorrow, you will die as the rest of them.\\]\r  \n\r  \n\u201cFarewell.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nHe said as he turned his back. That was my clue to run back. I ran back and tried his car.\r  \n\r  \nIt was unlocked, so I hid in the trunk. There was no way I would convince anyone that what I saw was true. And the size and form this thing took was much more sinister than I could ever describe. \r  \n\r  \nLuck was by my side again and he didn\u2019t notice me. I managed to run off at the first gas station he stopped after few towns. \r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m writing this 12-years later. I\u2019m 28 now and I\u2019ve been tracking this man for a long time. Something big is coming and I believe he knows what. \r  \n\r  \nAs for my hometown\u2026 The creature leveled it to the ground. All over the news it said massive earthquake did it. I don\u2019t even know if anyone actually believes that shit, but it doesn\u2019t matter if anyone believes anymore. They can believe in themselves and the veil has grown extremely thin.\r  \n\r  \nI am surprised I managed to let this much out, my hands are still shaking uncontrollably. Maybe I will try to write what transpired after I ran away after I've taken my pills and had some rest.",

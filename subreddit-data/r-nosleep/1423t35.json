    "postText": "\u201cWhy are there empty patches in your potato field, Mr Royston?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s the beauty of the pockets, Grant,\u201d He replied.\n\n\u201cPockets?\u201d I asked.\n\nThe wrinkled, sun-kissed farmer offered a wiry smile and nodded. He had always been an odd fellow, but I had a gut-twisting feeling that my town had changed drastically in the three years that I\u2019d been away. A thought confirmed by Mr Royston when he pulled something from the right-hand pocket of his denim jeans.\n\nA healthy handful of seed potatoes.\n\n\u201cI had a bad bunch,\u201d He said. \u201cBut I turned it into a good bunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t follow,\u201d I said.\n\nMr Royston chuckled gruffly. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose you would. About four months ago, pockets sprouted all over town. In the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoles?\u201d I asked.\n\nThe old farmer nodded. \u201cAye. They give you whatever you want. When my potatoes went bad, I put \u2018em in one of the pockets. They came out shiny and new. Straight out of the pockets in my denim jeans.\u201d\n\nI smiled politely, made my excuses, and went on my way. Mr Royston\u2019s house was the first one I passed on my walk from the bus stop, so I hadn\u2019t wanted to be rude when he called from the gate. But I was eager to get going. He always had some bizarre tale to tell. That much hadn\u2019t changed in three years.\n\nWhat I hadn\u2019t expected was that everybody else would be saying the same thing.\n\n\u201cFound one in my back garden,\u201d Said my old childhood friend, Frankie. \u201cI put a pound in there, and fifty pounds appeared in my dressing gown pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs everybody playing a prank on me?\u201d I asked. \u201cI know I committed the greatest sin by moving to the city, but you don\u2019t have to gang up on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Frankie protested. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t tease you. I know why you left.\u201d\n\n\u201cShow me,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s see this pocket in your garden.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d My friend explained. \u201cThey come and go.\u201d\n\nEither everybody in town had collectively lost their marbles or they\u2019d collaborated on the world\u2019s dullest prank. I wasn\u2019t sure which option I preferred. But I knew what I didn\u2019t want to do \u2014 head home.\n\nThat\u2019s the reason I left my town at the age of 22. I stuck around to look after my mother and sister, but I couldn\u2019t stand by as she tolerated my stepfather\u2019s abuse. I guess three years of growing guilt had finally brought me back home, but I expected my mum to tell me that Ronnie was a good man. I expected her to tell me that he had changed.\n\n\u201cYour mum\u2019s left,\u201d Ronnie said.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect that.\n\n\u201cLeft her childhood home? Left it to you?\u201d I scoffed. \u201cWhere\u2019s she gone?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get lippy with me, boy,\u201d My stepfather growled.\n\nSuddenly, I was a kid again. Staring into the eyes of a giant. A monstrous man with hollow eyes and predatory fangs. But he was just a man. I tried to remind myself of that.\n\n\u201cShe couldn\u2019t change her ways,\u201d Ronnie continued, shrugging. \u201cAlways jabbering, letting her eyes wander, and showing off her goods for everyone in town.\u201d\n\nI clenched my fists in fury, and Ronnie smiled wickedly, waiting for me to take the bait.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Claire?\u201d I asked, changing the subject.\n\nRonnie\u2019s face dropped. \u201cYour sister\u2019s in the garden. But you can\u2019t stay the night, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on that,\u201d I hissed through gritted teeth.\n\nI shoved past him and headed through the house to the garden. The cogs in my head were turning. Why would Mum abandon her daughter? She loved both of us. She begged me not to leave.\n\n\u201cGrant!\u201d Claire cried, embracing me.\n\n\u201cHey, munchkin,\u201d I said, wiping a tear from my eye. \u201cWhere\u2019s Mum?\u201d\n\nClaire\u2019s face shifted, and she shook her head. \u201cRonnie says she left, but I don\u2019t believe him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long\u2019s she been gone?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cAbout a month,\u201d Claire replied. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s got something to do with\u2026 Well, follow me.\u201d\n\nMy sister led me into the woods behind our house, and we barely walked thirty yards before I finally saw what everybody had been talking about.\n\nA chasm of dirt in the centre of a wooded clearing. Except it was more than that. The pocket, as everybody called it, had no bottom. It was a ceaseless cavern.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026 is happening?\u201d I asked.\n\nClaire sniffled. \u201cPeople say pockets disappear after a few days or a week. But this one\u2019s been here since last month. Since Mum went missing. And it just keeps growing.\u201d\n\nI could barely register what my little sister was saying. I unleashed a hoarse sound of horror, fearfully eyeballing the blackness below our feet. I was struggling to fathom how something so endless, so seismic, could have emerged in the heart of such a sleepy nowhere town.\n\nI still wanted to believe the pocket to be nothing more than a hole. An explainable anomaly. But I realised there was only one way to find out. I dipped a hand into my pocket, pulled out my phone, and hurled it into the abyss.\n\nMy sister didn\u2019t utter a word. She understood what I was doing. She knew that I had to see it for myself. And I did. Seconds later, I felt a weightiness return to my pocket. Inside, I found a far superior phone to my old one.\n\nIt was a miracle that other people had described with glee, but it filled me with terror. An endless pocket of terror in my body. As if the joy had been drained from my soul.\n\nWhatever the true nature of the holes that the townspeople called pockets, I knew it couldn\u2019t be anything good.\n\nDespite Ronnie\u2019s protests, I stood my ground and firmly stated that I would be staying the night. He reluctantly agreed, but he explained that he\u2019d turned my old bedroom into a study space, so I\u2019d have to sleep on the sofa.\n\nAround two in the morning, a sudden sound startled me.\n\nRustling.\n\nI sleepily sat up and turned on a lamp. The warm, muted, orange glow illuminated Ronnie\u2019s coat in the corner of the room. It was draped over the back of a rocking chair \u2014 a chair rocking of its own accord.\n\nMy breathing quickened as I watched the coat wriggle, as if some creature were trapped in the bunched-up mound of fabric. And then a terrifying thing happened.An arm wormed out of the coat pocket.\n\nThe limp limb was swiftly joined by a head, torso, and legs. It formed a ghoulish, spectral woman dressed in a black, hooded robe. I screamed when I saw her face.\n\nMum.\n\nBut not Mum at all.\n\nHer eyes were empty sockets, stained with blood and unidentifiable mush. Her mouth, on the other hand, was non-existent. Skin covered the space that her lips should have occupied. And then the horror made sense.\n\nAlways jabbering, so he removed her mouth. Eyes wandering, so he removed those too. Showing off her goods, so he draped her in a black, formless robe.\n\nI blubbered uncontrollably at the disfigured demon before me. I don\u2019t know what those pockets do, but I know that wasn\u2019t my mum. Not anymore.\n\nShe howled within her sealed face and lurched towards me. I shrieked, fleeing the room and bounding up the stairs as the black-robed shape pursued me.\n\n\u201cClaire!\u201d I screamed. \u201cCLAIRE!\u201d\n\nBumping sounds emanated from my sister\u2019s room, and she hurriedly opened the door to see what had horrified me. Claire screamed at the deformed woman who crept along the landing towards us.\n\n\u201cMum?\u201d My sister whimpered.\n\n\u201cNot anymore,\u201d A voice responded.\n\nMy sister and I swivelled our heads to face Ronnie, a monster terrifying enough in human form.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d Claire wailed.\n\n\u201cFixed her,\u201d Our stepfather whispered, creeping towards us. \u201cThat\u2019s why the pockets are here, children. Not for fools and their riches, but for us. For me.\u201d\n\nThe abomination and his creation, a warped replica of our mother, closed in. Both ends of the hallway were blocked. No escape.\n\n\u201cThis way!\u201d I shouted, shoving Claire back into her room and locking the door behind us.\n\n\u201cYou *wretches*!\u201d Ronnie roared, pounding on the door. \u201cI won\u2019t put you two in the pocket. Oh, no. You don\u2019t deserve that. I\u2019ll dig two holes for you. The real kind of holes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d Claire shakily stuttered between bawls.\n\nI pointed at her bedroom window, and my sister\u2019s eyes widened. She silently but vehemently shook her head. I gripped her hand and nodded, gently leading her towards the window and sliding it open. The wood of her bedroom door was starting to splinter \u2014 Ronnie was battering it with something.\n\nMy little sister and I dropped onto the thick shrubbery below the window and ran into the night.\n\nThat was several weeks ago. I haven\u2019t been able to sleep since. I took Claire back to the city with me, but we\u2019re still in survival mode. Neither of us want to face what happened \u2014 what is *still* happening in that town.\n\nWe\u2019ve thrown out all clothes with pockets.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

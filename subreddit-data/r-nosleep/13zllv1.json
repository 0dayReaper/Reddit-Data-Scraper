Scrambling to my feet, I looked behind me, hoping that whatever was chasing me had gone off somewhere else. \n\nIt was a mistake to come back to Endeavor for my 25 year reunion. I swore I\u2019d never step foot in this town again, with its three block main street where everyone was either a drunk, an abuser, or a holier-than-the saints-themselves wannabe street preacher, or some combination of all of the above. \n\nHow the hell do I get out of this cemetery? \n\nI\u2019d gotten drunk, but not so drunk that I shouldn\u2019t have been able to find my way out, even in this heavy mist. It descended as soon as we kicked over Mr. Grantz\u2019 headstone, that old, blustering asshole. He deserved some sort of retribution after the shit he put kids through for decades in this town. He was Mister Evangelical himself, somehow granted the right to stuff his convoluted ideologies on us in the place of an actual science education. \n\nAfter we turned a bit tipsy Derrick, Anne, Roger, and I decided to leave the bar that was hosting the reunion to stagger out to the cemetery one last time \u2014 pay homage to our old midnight refuge. What better way to relive our inglorious days? \n\nDamn! I hit my knee on another headstone. I just wanted out, an escape from this hellhole. \u201cI\u2019ll go home and never bother this place again!\u201d I shouted into the mist. \n\nDerrick played football \u2014 still as skinny and probably at least half as fast as that knobby-elbowed teenager who was practically chased out of town for not scoring a winning touchdown to get us to state. Anne was the girl we were all in love with. She stayed in town and teaches history, or I'm sure as much actual history as she can get away with uttering aloud. Roger couldn\u2019t do anything right, but could still get away with anything by his smile. \n\nOn June nights like this we\u2019d always go hang out late at night drinking non-age-appropriate beverages at the Endeavor cemetery. It was about a half-mile walk on the train tracks from \u201ctown.\u201d We\u2019d all sneak out with our flashlights and walk there, sometimes solo, sometimes in pairs, and even then it sort of creeped me out to go it alone, walking on that path of lonesome steel between the walls of tall grass that swayed in the wind. \n\nMy alcohol tolerance had gone way down since I grew up and life stopped being about partying. Otherwise I would have been way too inhibited to let those old friends pry me back to the cemetery. Whose idea was this?  It was Roger's ideas wasn't it?\n\nThe only good idea he had in his entire life is that we needed to get out of Endeavor. \n\nWas I running in circles or something? I limped in a direction I believed had to be the way out. Tipsy, sure, but there\u2019s no way I was drunk enough that I couldn\u2019t find my way out of a small town cemetery. \n\nIn high school Roger has been spared, but the rest of us had been Mr. Grantz\u2019 personal classroom punching bags, all because our families didn\u2019t go to church, or didn\u2019t go enough for Mr. Grantz\u2019 liking. My heathen mother even had the gall to speak the word \u201cevolution\u201d in public once, so as far as the church folk were concerned (meaning nearly everyone) my family needed to be chased out of town. \n\nCongratulations. Endeavor wasn't a paradise. It was a graveyard of aspiration. \n\nSo yeah, we stomped to the cemetery in the delirium of getting drunk together one last time in Endeavor after spending half our lives away from each other. \n\nDerrick is the one who stumbled onto Mr. Grantz\u2019 headstone. \u201cWhoa!? That psychopath finally died. Hallelujah!\u201d he yelled.\n\n\u201cDerrick!\u201d Anne said, \u201cI know you had your differences but that\u2019s no reason to celebrate his passing. He was a human being.\u201d She must have made her peace with the people of this town years ago. The rest of us did our real growing up once we got outside. \n\n\u201cDifferences? Do you remember when I missed that touchdown, how it was because my family was unclean? He was the one who kept telling people we needed to go back to the old ways and they should burn me on a pyre for it. It was one bad play against a team of kids who were twice our size.\u201d Derrick caught the wind in his throat, \u201cIt would be hard for me to mourn someone who wanted to kill a kid over a touchdown.\u201d\n\n\u201cI gotta piss,\u201d Roger said, smirking. \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Anne said. \n\n\u201cSee, even Roger wants to get this guy, and he wasn\u2019t even one of Mr. Grantz\u2019 targets.\u201d \n\nAs they argued I swayed in the wind getting angrier and angrier remembering that old blowhard. Once, when I was having trouble sleeping, I fell to sleep on my desk in the middle of his science class, and he dropped a bowling ball on my desk to wake me up and \u201cteach me a lesson.\u201d It slid off the desk and landed on my foot breaking some small bones that never healed well and still bother me to this day. \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s tip it over,\u201d I said.\n\nThey all looked at me wide eyed, then grins spread over Derrick and Roger\u2019s faces, devious in the moonlight. \n\n\u201cHell yeah!\u201d they agreed.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re all going to hell for this,\u201d Anne said, trying to stop them. But we were all already kicking at the marble headstone, trying to get it to budge from the Earth. My foot throbbed in that old familiar way, but this was worth it. \n\n\u201cAre you being serious, Anne? Are you a believer now? Don\u2019t tell me this town got to you,\u201d Derrick said. \n\n\u201c\u2018Got to me?\u2019If that\u2019s what you call growing up and getting over my youthful rebellious phase, then yes. Earl Grantz was a town hero. He only wanted the best for the people here and I can\u2019t just let you desecrate his grave.\u201d \n\nRoger blocked Anne from stopping us while Derrick and I kept kicking the headstone. Hard and heavy, the thing didn\u2019t want to budge. I got on its level and tried pushing it with my shoulder while Derrick kept kicking it. \n\nAfter a minute I fell to the ground to rest. \n\nAnne looked at me, \u201cIf you\u2019re having a heart attack you deserve it. You don\u2019t even know what will happen if you manage to knock that thing down. You don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll do.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh come on, I\u2019m going to be out of this town for the rest of my life in about six hours. There\u2019s nothing the community of Endeavor will be able to do to me ever again.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that,\u201d she said. \n\nI got back up and resumed kicking with Derrick who hadn\u2019t stopped for a second. In fact, it was like he was getting stronger and stronger, maybe remembering more of Mr. Granz\u2019 vitriolic outbursts. I could still see the old man with his white beard and loud, sharp face barrelling down at me for any perceived sleight. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s starting to give,\u201d Derrick said. \n\nThen all at once, with one last kick the headstone cracked at its base and thudded over into the damp grass. \n\n\u201cWhoa, we did it.\u201d Derrick took a step back. \n\nWe all stood there for a moment, struck by a kind of awe. That old man who had made things so hard for us in high school, he was really dead. He was dead in the ground and could never yell at us or throw bowling balls at us or set the entire town against us ever again. He was being eaten by worms. A sad meal. We\u2019d survived him and this town. \n\nI guess Anne was struck by a different kind of awe. Probably she was surprised at the audacity of her old friends, drunk and stupid in the cemetery. Whatever her feelings were, by the time I turned to look for her she\u2019d already disappeared into the night. \n\nWe had a good laugh, the three of us, reunited for this taste of revenge. The headstone lay there in the barely tended grass and I thought of how pointless his attacks on us had been, the harassment, the ostracization, the constant preaching and withholding of an actual education \u2014 we were all doing fine to spite him. Derrick worked as head of sales at a sportswear company, I was the top non-profit tax whiz in my city, Roger had one of those vague program manager positions at an even more vague start-up gone big, and we all had families waiting for us at home. \"Here lies a failure in life and death\" is what the headstone should have read. \n\nThat\u2019s when we heard it, a placeless whispering descended onto the cemetery. \n\nIt was as if the wind was made of barely audible voices, speaking in rolling anger that went on and on. And with it a dark mist fell on us. \n\n\u201cWhat the \u2014\u201d Roger said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the mist playing tricks on us, an auditory illusion,\u201d Derrick said.\n\nBut up the back of my spine a tingling sensation had already started to warn me that something insidious was happening. Even when we were children, we\u2019d joked about how the mist in the cemetery felt unnatural, but now it came on twice as quickly and it was twice as thick. I could barely see the others. \u201cWe should start making it back to our cars,\" I said.\n\n\"I don't remember the fog ever being this bad,\" Derrick said.\n\n\"We had actual flashlights with us. That might have made a difference,\" I offered. We only had the flashlights on our phones, and as the moments passed the mist deepened until they were nearly useless. \n\n\"Climate change,\" Roger said. \n\n\"Don't tell that one to Mr. Grantz,\" I said. \n\nLaughing, Derrick stumbled on a small divet in the ground, rolling onto his back. I think he saw something then. I can\u2019t say for sure, but as I looked down at him, my mind still blurred by the alcohol, I saw a serious fear drawn over his eyes, stifling his laughter. For a moment his lip quivered before he let out a scream that was swallowed by the thick country air. A column of mist poured into his mouth. It might have been the shock, but I thought in the mist I saw a torrent of pale hands forcing their way down his throat. \n\nDerrick\u2019s body convulsed. He shook harder and harder until the attack ceased and he sank, limp, into the ground. \n\n\u201cHelp!\u201d Roger screamed as he was pulled into the mist by something I couldn\u2019t see. \n\nI didn\u2019t wait a moment longer. I didn\u2019t try to stay and help my friends or check to see if Derrick was still alive. I bolted. Whatever that was in the mist, if I could put some distance between myself and it, maybe I could get out of this cemetery, follow the traintracks back to town, get back into my Honda Civic and drive away from this godforsaken town. \n\nThe mumbling whispers grew louder behind me, but I didn\u2019t dare look. I\u2019d give anything just to make it out of this cemetery. This was a stupid night. I never should have come back, but I wasn\u2019t going to let this drunken mistake leave my children to grow up without a father. \n\nSorry Derrick, I thought. Sorry Roger. And, what in the hell happened to Anne? What was it she said, we didn\u2019t know what they\u2019ll do? Is that what\u2019s happening now? \n\nI ran until my lungs burned, bumping into headstones left and right. This place wasn\u2019t a labyrinth. How was it that I hadn\u2019t gotten out of it by now? The cemetery couldn\u2019t be bigger than a couple few city blocks. Hardly anyone lived in Endeavor to begin with. It didn\u2019t take much space to house their dead. How many of these people have been completely forgotten to time by now? How many of them were succeeded only by children like me, children who they chased out of town. How many of them had bigoted, evil hearts like Mr. Grantz?\n\nMy knee smacked on something hard, another headstone, and I cried out. I could hardly move anymore from all the bruises I\u2019d just taken. But I limp-ran in desperation, my hurt leg skidding on the ground. The mist was close behind me. I could feel it wet on the back of my neck, but I knew I only needed to make it a little further. \n\nAn exposed tree root caught my foot and I tumbled to the ground, my head knocking against something hard. I frantically crawled back toward my feet but I kept falling back down. I wasn\u2019t seeing straight. Why is this happening to me? I swore I\u2019d never come back. \n\nIt was Anne that reached out to us all. She\u2019d wanted to bring the old gang back together for the reunion. Over half the class had stayed in town after graduation, but the rest of us had left Endeavor, and from what I gathered none of us spared a look back. Why didn\u2019t we ever think of how that would have felt for Anne? She didn\u2019t have the same agency as the rest of us. Heck, her parents had threatened to pull her from school and homeschool her in their traditional way. Of course she ended up like this. We were her lifeline. \n\nDamn it!\n\nEvery time I tried to get up I twisted some other muscle and collapsed back to the ground. I\u2019d never put my body through something like this before, especially after the age of forty. I\u2019d already been dreading the day-long hangover I saw in my future as we left the bar, but at this rate I\u2019d be lucky to be able to walk \u2014 that is, if I even got out of this cemetery alive. \n\nAnne had gone to the trouble of mailing us each nice, handwritten letters on stationary inviting us to the reunion. She wanted everyone to get together. It was incredibly thoughtful of her. Apparently she\u2019d worked with all the others to make sure everyone else who\u2019d abandoned Endeavor had an invitation. Of course, not everyone came, but most of the class made it. \n\nWe met at Freddy\u2019s, an old country dive we\u2019d never been able to get into before. In Endeavor everybody knows everybody, so there\u2019s no sneaking into bars with a fake id. \n\nI\u2019d been in city dives, but Freddy\u2019s was something else. It reminded me more of a barn where bats would live in the rafters than a bar \u2014 a big open space with tables strung about here and there, a pool table near the corner, dust counting the years on the floor. Just my guess, but I don\u2019t think the owner knows what the flooring is made of, that\u2019s how often it looked like it\u2019d been cleaned. Still, it was nice coming back and seeing this part of Endeavor we\u2019d always wondered about. \n\nThe folks that stayed in town welcomed us back in, but it was obvious there was a sort of familiarity and camaraderie among them that the rest of us would never have again \u2014 the kind of camaraderie that comes from spending forty years with the same small group of people, of having small town secrets and knowing all the things in a human life that can go unsaid. \n\nIt was Anne\u2019s idea to go to the cemetery, wasn\u2019t it?\n\nShe could tell we were all a bit uncomfortable and wanted to catch up more privately. As always, she was the sensitive person who could tell what we were all feeling and gave us direction. There was a time when I was young when I thought I\u2019d grow up to marry her \u2014 funny to think of it now, that I pictured my life in Endeavor, of scraping out an existence in this place that now seemed so desolate, an isolated island away from everything that truly mattered to me. I\u2019m sure Derrick and Roger felt like that too. Did Anne think about us like that? In her imagination, had she pictured the future with each of us, trying us on like coats, only to be abandoned in the end. \n\nThe mist had gotten so deep I couldn\u2019t see where I was going, though I\u2019d slowed to a crawl. My hand felt something cold and hard on the ground. I pulled myself close and I saw the inscription, \u201cHere lies Earl Grantz.\u201d After all that running I was back at Mr. Grantz\u2019 headstone where I\u2019d started. \n\nI lifted myself to my feet and noticed two long shapes beside me on the ground. Derrick and Roger. My heart dropped. Something had dragged them back. \n\nA cold hand grabbed onto my hair and pulled my head back. The mist poured into my open mouth like a thousand frozen beads of pain. I tried to scream, but it kept pouring into me as I collapsed to the damp dirt on my already bruised and skinned knees. Stop! Please, I can\u2019t take any more! I wanted to beg. It kept going until I lost consciousness. \n\nI awakened to the sun already high in the sky, my whole body throbbing with pain. Derrick was nudging me with his foot. \n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he gasped, \u201cwe\u2019re all alive then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? What just happened?\u201d I asked.\n\nHe stood above me with Roger. Alive. Somehow after the events of last night we\u2019d made it to the morning in the land of the living. I didn\u2019t orphan my kids. \n\n\u201cI saw the mist get you, both of you. I ran, but I couldn\u2019t escape the cemetery,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cAll I know is that I\u2019m getting out of here and I\u2019m not looking back,\u201d Roger said. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m with ya.\u201d Derrick helped me up to my feet. \n\nNeither of them was as outwardly hurt as I knew I was. I could feel every scrape and bruise down to my bones, not to mention the hangover. \u201cWhat about Anne?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo sign of her.\u201d \n\nBefore we limped back to town I pulled out my cellphone to see the worried messages from my wife. She assumed I\u2019d only gotten drunk and let my phone die. I sent her a selfie of my swollen face and said that last night hadn\u2019t gone as planned, but I was on my way home \u2014 desperate to get out of godforsaken Endeavor \u2014 and would explain everything to her. How could I explain this? I can\u2019t even explain it to myself. \n\nI told the others about the events of last night after I\u2019d lost them, and they nodded, listening. None of us had anything resembling a logical explanation. \n\nMy phone dinged with a message. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe! I was so worried. But are you using some sort of filter? Your eyes are green in this picture.\u201d",

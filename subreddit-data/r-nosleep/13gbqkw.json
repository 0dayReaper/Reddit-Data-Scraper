    "postText": "When I was seventeen, I drove to the capitol of our state one warm summer night. It was a rundown area. Prostitutes, heroin, cannabis, crack, meth and everything else was sold, basically in open air markets. The police knew what was going on, and made occasional busts to make it seem like they cared, but the problem never got any better. If anything, it got worse. It seemed for every pusher arrested, two more were waiting in the shadows to take his place. The young men in the area had few jobs and even less hope for a bright future, so most of them turned to selling drugs or pimping, joining gangs and oftentimes shooting each other for almost no reason at all.\n\n\nI was just a young male with a healthy curiosity about LSD, and absolutely no idea where to find it. Coming down here had been a last resort, an insane gamble born of despair. As a whole, hard drugs like fentanyl and cocaine are sold in parts like this, not mystical white crystals like LSD or DMT. No one was interested in consciousness expansion anymore, after all. They were interested in whatever fucked them up the most, and that was it. That was what sold.\n\n\nAnd yet, near the corner, I saw a man who fit the bill of someone who might know about psychedelic drugs. He was wearing a blood-red shirt with a black upside-down pentagram emblazoned on both sides. He had dozens of piercings and metal implants all up and down his face, and his head was totally bald. I thought back to what DARE had said about drug dealers. He seemed to fit the bill of what they had taught us in school. \n\n\n\u201cFirst, it starts with the hallucinogens. Pretty soon everyone is into witchcraft and Satanism and jumping out of windows, thinking they can fly like Icarus with a head full of acid.\u201d That was almost verbatim what the extremely knowledgeable and dedicated police officer who came to our school had said, and who was I to doubt him? He was, after all, a professional.\n\n\n\u201cHello there,\u201d I said amiably to the Satanist. He smiled.\n\n\n\u201cHello, friend,\u201d he said in a hissing voice. I saw his tongue had been surgically split in two, and each side had a silver piercing. \u201cMy name is Naberius.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOK, I\u2019m Davey, Mr. Naberius. I was wondering if you know where I can purchase some LSD? Or maybe some mescaline?\u201d I said calmly. He laughed.\n\n\n\u201cSadly, no, I don\u2019t know where the acid is right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt must be a dry spell. Everyone around here is just into smack, and there\u2019s so little demand for consciousness expansion now. But I do have human pineal glands for sale.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHuman pineal glands?\u201d I asked, a feeling of dread going down my spine. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is the greatest high you can imagine,\u201d he said, his dilated pupils staring straight into my soul. \u201cTotally non-addictive, too. You just chew it up like bubblegum. It doesn\u2019t taste great, but it will get you far higher than acid. Some people shoot up the extract of pineal gland too for an even more intense experience.\u201d I raised one eyebrow, skeptical. I was just a teenager, but I wasn\u2019t totally naive. If this \u201cpineal gland\u201d stuff was so good, why had I never heard of it?\n\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said, handing me a small baggy with a tiny bloody worm-like thing curled up on the bottom. I made a face.\n\n\n\u201cThis?\u201d I asked, more skeptical than ever.\n\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like much,\u201d he responded, \u201cbut trust me, kid- that shit will have you tripping balls in no time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know what, kid? We\u2019re having a party tonight. Just a few miles away. 217 Blane Road. We\u2019re letting people try out pineal glands for free. Just to do, you know, a favor to the community.\u201d He smiled wide at me, showing far too many teeth. \u201cWe\u2019d love to have you join us. We may even have some free adrenochrome for you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOK!\u201d I said, returning the man\u2019s smile. I was somewhat hesitant to go to a party full of Satanists, but I also realized how rude it would be to turn down such a kind invitation. Little did I know it at the time, but I had just agreed to join in on a meeting of some of the most deranged cult members known to the entirety of the human race. It was too bad I didn\u2019t just find some acid.\n ***\n\n\nThe town of Harlequin Springs a few miles outside the capitol looked like what the whole USA might look like if Stalin had won the Cold War. It had dirty buildings and cracked roads. The sidewalks, in the rare places there were any, were uneven and filled with holes.\n\n\nPeople trudged to work with dead, flat eyes and hunched backs. They smelled of cheap soup and even cheaper cigarettes. No one smiled or laughed. Everything vital and good seemed to have been sucked out of the town, even the people\u2019s humanity.\n\n\nI parked on the side of the dark street, walking past these sad clusters of humanity. No one made eye contact or said hello. They trudged forward as fast as they could, likely going from work to home, or from home to work. They likely didn\u2019t know much else for entertainment. Except maybe some smack or booze to relax and forget about their shitty lives, and enough caffeine and cigarettes to work the increasingly-long and poorly-paid shifts, but that was about it. A few run-down, working-class bars had their lights on, and an occasional wino stumbled in or out every couple minutes, most of them smelling of vomit, body odor and cheap gin.\n\n\nI found the house after a few minutes of walking. Many of the houses had the numbers totally faded or fallen off, and for a few blocks, I didn\u2019t know exactly where I was or how far I had gone along the road. Then I heard loud music coming from a house up ahead. It was a large old Victorian with fading, dark-red paint on the exterior. The music sounded like a slowed down symphony with discordant notes and low, stretched-out screams added in. It sounded like a concert orchestrated by Satan.\n\n\nI knocked at the door, and it opened immediately into a shadowy room. Multiple black-lights were lit all around the walls and ceiling, and as the host smiled at me, all I could see were teeth that had been filed to points and the glowing whites of his eyes. I saw people all around the background, sitting in chairs and drinking, smoking cigarettes, laughing and dancing. It seemed in all regards like a fairly normal party.\n\n\nI still had the human pineal gland in my pocket, sealed in an airtight plastic bag. I was saving it for after I had become comfortable. After all, I didn\u2019t really know the effects of chewing on one, though I heard rumors that it was like a short-lived combination of methamphetamine, pure adrenaline and DMT. I squeezed the bag with my right hand, feeling the gross, fetus-shaped gland squish under my fingers, slipping across to the other side of the bag as I did so.\n\n\n\u201cUgh,\u201d I thought. \u201cI hope it tastes better than it looks.\u201d I had my doubts, however.\n\n\nThings got crazier and crazier as I walked further into the house. Down the hallway, I saw the light in the kitchen was on. A super-tall man stood there, sticking a needle into his jugular, looking into the mirror to make sure he didn\u2019t miss the spot. He took a deep breath and harrumphed, blowing his chest up. It bulged his neck out more to enlarge the blood vessels, making it easier for him to find the place. I smiled at him, his grim expression reflected back at me.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said in a calm voice. \u201cIt\u2019s just adrenochrome.\u201d I nodded warily. Adrenochrome. The purified drug extracted from many human pineal glands. Like everyone else, I knew the adrenochrome could only be harvested from a fresh body, such as a murder victim or someone who had just died of natural causes. Trying to take it from a corpse that had been laying around just gave off metabolites and degraded byproducts that were totally worthless to the purification of the rare and very expensive chemical.\n\n\n\u201cI was only five-feet-tall when I started taking adrenochrome everyday,\u201d the man said in a deep, rumbling voice after he had pulled out the silver needle from his flesh, capping it and stuffing it in his pocket. The pupils of his eyes were rapidly dilating and constricting, and now he was sweating heavily. His breathing was fast and erratic. He seemed to tremble, his entire body filled with a massive inner tension that appeared on the verge of giving him a stroke.\n\n\n\u201cWow!\u201d I said, genuinely amazed. \u201cThis stuff must be great for your body if you\u2019ve grown that much!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, it is,\u201d he said, smiling a dreadful smile, a trickle of blood running down his face from one nostril. His tremendous muscles bulged, his veins popping like snare drums in time with his heartbeat. He smiled at me, extending his hand. It dwarfed mine as I shook it.\n\n\n\u201cMy name is Davey,\u201d I said happily, content to have made such a classy new friend.\n\n\n\u201cThey call me Zebadoon,\u201d the man said, stretching out the word in his deep growl. \u201cI am a follower of Moloch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCool!\u201d I said, though I had no idea what that meant. \u201cYou mean like, on Twitter?\u201d He laughed at this, slapping me on the back so hard I almost fell over. Looking down, I saw he was totally strapped. He had some massive pistol in his waistband that looked like it fired shotgun slugs, a flak-jacket on, and tattoos all over his body. I recognized one as the Black Sun, another as the Baphomet. There was writing across his arms that didn\u2019t appear to be a part of any language I had ever seen. I was a little nervous now, admittedly. Why did he think he needed guns?\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a riot, Davey,\u201d he said, wiping a tear from his eye. \u201cJust for that, I\u2019ll give you a free shot. How would you like some adrenochrome?\u201d I hesitated. I had never done adrenochrome before. I thought it might be better to start with a pineal gland, just kind of chew on it, at least before moving up to the purified stuff. But I also knew it would be rude to turn the man down. I nodded, my heart racing in my chest. I was too scared to turn it down, but I was also scared to try it. I had heard\u2026 rumors. Rumors of the terrible things that sometimes happened to people who did too much adrenochrome.\n\n\n\u201cAwesome,\u201d he said, pulling out a clean needle from his back pocket. It was already filled with some kind of liquid. He handed it to me, and I looked close at it. The liquid was silvery and thick, almost like mercury that had been watered down. Tiny floating particles suspended throughout seemed to catch and reflect the light in an iridescent rainbow of colors. It certainly looked like absolutely pure adrenochrome.\n\n\n\u201cThanks, mister!\u201d I said, starting to go to the bathroom. He stopped me with one giant arm.\n\n\n\u201cNah, I think you should do it here,\u201d he said. So I sat down at the kitchen table, poking and prodding at my skin until a flash of blood entered the needle. I pushed down on the plunger, and the adrenochrome went right into my system.\n\n\n\n\nI tasted it immediately as it entered my bloodstream. It tasted like mints and burning chemicals. I almost screamed out when the fluid entered my brain. My brain felt like it was on fire. But as quickly as it had started, the pain went away, and then the drug started to take over.\n\n\nI jumped up, a wild surge of energy going through my body. The face of the Satanist appeared to be melting onto the floor in front of me, his eyes bubbling and dripping out of their sockets. \n\n\nAt that moment, the basement door, which had been next to the mirror Zebadoon had been using, burst open in a frenzy. It slammed against the far wall. The adrenochrome had made me jumpy, as jumpy as a cat who just ate a whole handful of caffeine pills, and I smashed my head against the wall in surprise. \n\n\nMy ears rang, a high-pitched whine that made it feel like nails were being driven into my frontal lobe, and for a moment, I saw bright white stars. But my vision rapidly cleared, and I saw a young girl. She couldn\u2019t have been more than fifteen. She had a broken chain that dragged behind her leg, and her face was totally covered in dirt, except for tracks below her eyes where she had obviously been crying. She looked directly at me, then at Zebadoon. Without hesitation, she made a run for it, zigging and zagging past the massive hands of the Satanist, who tried to grab her but was simply too big and slow for such a fast and panicked girl.\n\n\n\n\u201cGet her, Davey!\u201d Zebadoon yelled. She was almost through the door.\n\n\nI felt like a Nazi, but after all, I was a guest in their home. I made a lunge, and at the last possible second, I grabbed the broken metal chain that dragged behind one ankle. She stumbled, falling hard on her side. Shaking her head, she got up, looking at me holding the chain- and then proceeded to punch me in the eye. Her expression was feral and rabid.\n\n\n\u201cOw! God dammit!\u201d I yelled, grabbing at my rapidly swelling eye. The seven-foot-tall freak with the tattoos in his eyes came running into the room, shaking the floor with his massive weight. He was sweating heavily, his eyes glancing left and right at a furious pace, his breathing fast and growing faster as he grabbed the girl by her shoulder, spinning her around.\n\n\nGrabbing a switchblade from his pocket, he went right for the girl\u2019s pineal gland. He slammed the knife down as hard as he could in the middle of her skull, and I heard a tremendous crack. Twisting the knife, the bone and flesh split open, her mouth opening and her legs giving way as he split open her head like a walnut.\n\n\n\u201cThis is getting a little crazy in here,\u201d I mumbled to myself, making my way unsteadily towards the back door. I had to get out. I was rapidly regretting attending this party in the first place. What had I been thinking?\n\n\nThe adrenochrome was still doing a number on me by this point. I was sweating heavily. The walls were melting, revealing that the house was actually made of bones underneath. Every person I saw looked horribly mutated to my hallucinating mind. One goth woman who came in the back door seemed to have had all of her skin burned off, and now only smoking muscles stood out all over her body. She smiled at me, but all I saw were blackened gums and cracked, rotted teeth falling out in pieces.\n\n\n\n\u201cIgnore the effects of this drug,\u201d I thought to myself through gritted teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s just a hallucination.\u201d But then again, I was in the company of Satanists. How would I tell what was real and what wasn\u2019t here?\n\n\nThe backyard seemed a much more calming area. There were men and women in black robes gathered in a semi-circle around a tractor-trailer that had, for some reason, been parked in the yard. There was no driver in the cab. The trailer itself was painted black with various esoteric and Satanic symbols painted all over it.\n\n\nThe group of people were chanting in some language I had never heard before. It sounded similar to Semitic languages I had heard, but it certainly had a lot more hissing and gurgling than Hebrew or Arabic would have. In the front of the crowd, I saw Naberius. I felt slightly calmer at finding a familiar face. The cool night breeze helped my flushed, sweating skin, and the hallucinations seemed to be receding somewhat. But my clothes and shoes felt tighter. I couldn\u2019t say for sure yet, but it felt like I was growing.\n\n\nNaberius and his group finished their chanting, opening the back door to the trailer. Something huge began to emerge from the black depths within. All I saw at first was a massive clawed hand with too many fingers grabbing the open door of the trailer, then another hand grabbed the other side. And then another hand grabbed the ceiling, and another one the floor. \u201cHow many hands does it have?!\u201d I thought in a moment of panic. I wondered if I should run. But then I remembered what supposedly happened to people who ran from predators. Stragglers get eaten first, people always said, and running will bring out the hunting instinct in any predator who sees you. With a sick, squelching sound, the thing began to drag itself forward, sticking an ancient head out and looking around.\n\n\nIts eyes seemed to have their own inner fire, a red and orange flickering light that came from within. Its nose was just two slits, its ears just two more. Its mouth was disengaged like a snake\u2019s, its heavy jaw hanging down and showing a mouth full of perfectly sharp teeth, with extra rows glimmering behind the first. But its skin was what really disturbed me.\n\n\nIt was mostly white with cyanotic blue patches mottling its body. Huge sores and wounds leaked pus and maggots onto the floor of the truck and the grass of the yard as it pushed its massive bulk forward. As I looked closer, I realized that nearly every inch of its skin had writhing maggots and insects embedded within. It made me feel sick to my stomach.\n\n\n\u201cLord Jesus in Heaven!\u201d I bellowed on seeing the sickly, ancient beast. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d It was, apparently, the wrong thing to say when surrounded by a yard full of Satanists. Dozens of eyes and frowning, twisted mouths glared over at me. I saw one guy unstrap his pistol.\n\n\nBut I was saved by the creature itself. With a speed it had not yet shown, it pushed itself out of the truck and shot one of its four skeletal, milky-white arms towards the nearest Satanist. With a scream, the young man was ripped off the ground, his black robes fluttering under the stars. The creature shoved the man\u2019s head into its mouth and clanked its reptilian jaws shut. The snapping of its hundreds of teeth together sent an echo like a gunshot across the yard. The music inside the house stopped suddenly.\n\n\nThe people in the yard began to scatter. I saw the other three arms of the creature shoot out and grab three more people before they could even turn. Naberius was one. With a spray of blood, the creature began to eat them, shoving screaming body after screaming body into its mouth. Its silver saliva mixed with the bright red arterial sprays of the dying men and women as it ate them alive.\n\n\nWithout a second thought, I ran back into the house, panicking. I thought I might have a full-blown anxiety attack by this point. The house seemed to offer more protection than being out in the open, but it didn\u2019t help my panic. \n\n\nYet, when I got back in there, everyone was gone. I looked this way and that, trying to figure out where they had moved to. Some of them might have gone to the backyard, but certainly not all of them.\n\n\nThe front door burst open with a cracking of wood, and two cops came in. The first grabbed me roughly with one hand.\n\n\nThe cop looked like he wanted to castrate me. With his other hand, he had his gun pointed directly between my forehead, his brown eyes impassively looking me up and down, like a farmer regarding a cow before slitting its throat. My heart was beating too fast. I thought I might pass out.\n\n\nSome party, I thought to myself.\n\n\n\u201cPut your hands up, you fucking freak!\u201d he said. I did. \u201cYou sick, kidnapping, murdering Satanists. I should kill you right now just on general principles.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand!\u201d I said, my voice growing deeper, my shirt and pants increasingly feeling tight as the adrenochrome kept spreading throughout my body. \u201cI\u2019m just a guest at this party. In reality, I\u2019m a high school student named\u2026\u201d\n\n\nBut I never got my name out. At that moment, the arms of the creature shot in through the front door, breaking it into a million pieces and splintering the threshold and walls. Both cops were grabbed from behind before they even knew what was happening to them. They screamed, shooting randomly at the huge arms and hands of the beast. One of the bullets whizzed past my head, missing me by barely an inch.\n\n\n\u201cFuck this!\u201d I screamed. \u201cI\u2019m getting out of here!\u201d I sprinted through the back of the house. The yard was a scene of utter gore and death. Every Satanist I saw back there had either been ripped in half, had most of his body eaten or was missing a head.\n\n\nThe creature heard my footsteps, and came bounding around the side of the house, shaking the earth. Grabbing the human pineal gland from my pocket, I threw it at the thing. It stopped all at once, sniffing with its snake-like nostrils, bending towards the bag. I didn\u2019t look back. I had seen enough. I was never coming back to this town again. \n\n\nI sprinted randomly into the woods, getting caught in brush and prickerbrushes, but eventually I made my way back out onto the main street. There was no sign of the creature. In fact, there was no sign of anyone at all at this hour. I was alone.\n\n\nAnd so I left, walking down the street, covered in blood, two inches taller than when I went in- and so totally and completely overcome by fear of what I had seen, so mentally consumed by loathing and panic, that I doubted I would ever be the same again.",

And I'll triple distill that junk by precise evaporation probably with methanol. Got a hit for you. 10 EpiPens and.... $100 let me know if u want to try it. It isn't scheduled by the DEA. In real life it's just crappy make you sick hard to get methamphetamine.",

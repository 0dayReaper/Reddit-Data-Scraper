    "postText": "My grandma is dying. \n\nWe sat outside her room, and my mom was crying into her hands, and my dad was absently rubbing her back and staring off into the distance. \n\nHer room sat at the end of our house, and mom pulled chairs from our dining table and placed them along the wall of the hallway to simulate a morbid scene. Grandma didn\u2019t want to be taken to the hospital, so mom brought the hospital to her. \n\nGrandma called out, and mom jumped up and quickly entered her room. She came out seconds later with a perturbed expression on her face.\n\n\u201cShe asked for you, Millie.\u201d \n\nMy heart dropped into my stomach. I don\u2019t do well with death, especially when it\u2019s my grandma. I was close to her, a lot closer to her than I was to my parents. \n\nI stood, and entered her room. \n\nIt was dark in there, and just smelled sickly. Her heavily draped room suddenly felt claustrophobic and stifling. \n\nShe demanded that we leave her salmon pink curtains tightly closed, so only a thin sliver of light leaked into her previously vibrant room. \n\n\u201cMillie,\u201d grandma\u2019s weak voice beckoned me from the mound of blankets on her double bed. \n\nI hesitantly paused, before walking closer and catching her free hand. Her hand was as light as bird bones. \n\n\u201cYes grandma?\u201d I lowered my voice, my normal voice would seem too loud in this room. \n\n\u201cI want to absolve myself.\u201d Grandma whispered, her hand squeezed mine lightly. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, grandma. You wer- are a saint.\u201d I smiled at her, but I knew it was a grimace. \n\n\u201c\u2014need to absolve myself from my sins. And my family\u2019s.\u201d Grandma continued as if I never spoke. \u201cIt was a different time, when we were growing up. We struggled a lot. We lived on a farm, my daddy was a struggling man. My momma just decided that us girls needed to mind our business. Anyway, there was a particularly bad year that rolled into two more years. My daddy came home one day with a butcher paper package and he wouldn\u2019t look us in the eye. We never questioned it since my daddy was the man in the household. One day, I got curious. I followed him when he went to go and pick up the meat for the house and-\u201c \n\nGrandma pulled her her hand out of my grasp and looked away from me. I pulled her hand back into my grasp, my pulse kicking up. \n\n\u201cGrandma?\u201d I asked quietly. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m asking \u2014 are you okay? what did my great grandfather do? \n\n\u201cMillie. It was human. Human meat. He saw me and \u2014 and he got so unfathomably angry but I left before he could whoop me into next week. I ran home and my momma yelled at me for hours about shirking my duties and chores. Daddy came home with a different coloured butcher paper full of meat, and he eyed me silently. I ate it without any complaints, but I could taste that it was different. The other stuff was richer and tasted be- tasted something different.\u201d \n\nI wanted to recoil and run away from my grandma, close my eyes against the depravity I just heard. \n\nBut the way she was describing the taste, it made me think of mom\u2019s special supper. She made it every so often, and she made a huge deal out of it. I wasn\u2019t allowed to go over to my friend\u2019s place or invite anybody over. \n\nI gulped, and grandma saw it, and her face changed, and she started wailing. \n\nI ripped my hand out of her grasp, and mom immediately opened the door, as if she was standing there.\n\n\u201cMillie!\u201d She scolded loudly. \u201cYou\u2019ve upset her.\u201d \n\nI blushed darkly and ran from the room, tears and shame bubbling on the surface. Dad tried to stop me, but I shrugged him off and ran to my room. \n\nI decided I\u2019ll become vegan.  \n\nThink I\u2019ll end the post here\u2026 don\u2019t judge me too much.\n\n*May 19th*\n\nI told my mom the next day, and she eyed me silently. \n\n\u201cNo meat?\u201d She asked, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cWell, maybe not a vegan, but a vegetarian. Still, yeah, no meat,\u201d I smiled nervously at my mom\u2019s expression. \n\n\u201cHm, interesting. So you won\u2019t be joining us for my special supper in about,\u201d she paused and quickly glanced down the hall and back again as if it was a subconscious action. \u201cA day or two?\u201d \n\nI swallowed against the rising nausea crawling up my throat and grinned. \u201cYeah, sorry mom.\u201d \n\nShe nodded stiffly and continued to wash the dishes. \n\nI stepped out of the kitchen and make my way down the hall, before my dad stopped me. \n\n\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t have any visitors, Millie.\u201d Dad said gruffly.\n\nMy heart pounded and my hands shook. Somehow, why do I think grandma didn\u2019t really have a say in going to the hospital or not. \n\n\u2014\nMy grandma died two days later. \n\nNow we\u2019re at the dining table, with plates of food placed in front of us. \n\nMom and dad had seasoned meat and mashed potatoes and some caramelized carrots. \n\nI had a plate full of carrots and mashed potatoes, and I tried not to look at their food with any type of longing. Not that I\u2019m trying to eat anyone, but my sudden choice of vegetarianism is really out of survival. \n\nMy mom stared at me as she took her first bite, and the lump of mashed potatoes I ate suddenly turned into a ball in my stomach. \n\nI glanced away from her and stared at my plate. My mom started tapping her steak knife against her plate. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure you want to stay a vegetarian, Mil?\u201d \n\n\u201cMhm,\u201d I acknowledged, looking up at her. Dad was silently eating too, but his eyes were trained on his plate. \n\n\u201cOkay, but I went through all this trouble\u2026\u201d mom said, shrugging offhandedly. \n\n\u201cI see that, it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve been thinking about this for awhile and with grandma dying, I thought a lifestyle change would be good for me.\u201d I said, suddenly now wanting to cry. \n\nGrandma did what she had to do survive, but mom and dad are well off. I don\u2019t know why she started doing this \u2014 or dad, for that matter. \n\nI swallowed loudly, and quickly grabbed my water and half chugged it. My mouth went dry. \n\n\u201cCan I be excused? I\u2019m not feeling well.\u201d I asked, my eyes skipping over their plates. \n\n\u201cLeave your plate, I\u2019ll clean it up.\u201d Mom said dismissively, an angry expression on her face. She still hadn\u2019t stopped tapping her knife against the plate. \n\nThe haunting tapping followed me all the way to my room, and I rolled myself onto my bed and fell into a fitful sleep.\n\nSomething wakes me up. I quickly hop onto my phone and tap \u201cschedule post for 20 minutes from now.\u201d \n\nI was going to post this earlier, but I was just writing this down to\u2026I don\u2019t know, wrap my head around things? I guess the title of this should\u2019ve been, \u201cWho Have We Been Eating?\u201d \n\nI know that posting this will make me seem like a monster, and you\u2019ll think that my family are monsters who eat other people. In my defence, I didn\u2019t know. My mom and dad though? Go ahead and think that about them, but please don\u2019t think my grandma is-\n\nIs that my door?",

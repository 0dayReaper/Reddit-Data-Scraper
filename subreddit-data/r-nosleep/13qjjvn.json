    "postText": "My name is Amanda Marks.  You\u2019re receiving this because something terrible is about to happen to me.  Please tell the authorities if I don't survive, and let them know who the responsible person is.  \n\nIf I die, my father in law is the killer.  It is not due to complications during childbirth.  \n\nFrancis Marks is responsible.\n\nWhere do I even begin?  How can I convince you to believe me?  \n\nEspecially knowing how conniving and manipulative that bastard can be\u2026   With everything that's happened, I'm almost tempted to leave parts of it out, since it will probably sound farfetched.  But I won't.  I'll tell you all of it.\n\nHere goes. \n\nPeter - my fiance - was the kindest man I\u2019d ever met.  He was the kind of person you notice from across the room and just have to go talk to.  We met at a party at a friend's house.  Boring story I know - but the years we've spent together have been anything but.  \n\nOur time since we met hasn't been a fairy tale romance - I'm not sure those really exist in everyday life - but it's been amazing and special and I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\nHis family is another story altogether.  \n\nI\u2019ve never known a man so easily persuaded by his father.  But, to be fair, just about anyone can be persuaded by Frank.  \n\nThe man worked as a professional stage performer for many years.  He was a mentalist.  If you\u2019re not familiar it\u2019s sort of like a magician who can predict what people will say and how they will answer questions.  They are master manipulators, and they are experts at reading people\u2019s reactions and figuring out their responses.\n\nA good mentalist can make it feel as if they are right inside your mind, listening to your thoughts, and making suggestions you can\u2019t ignore.  And Frank was one of the very best when he was in his prime - selling out theaters and traveling around the world showing off his special talents.  He made so much money that he retired at the age of fifty and now lives very comfortably in a huge house outside of town.  \n\nWhile he was touring he went by the stage name: Francis Folds.  This was before the age of the internet, so there\u2019s almost no information out there about him.  \n\nWhat I do know is that he\u2019s extremely dangerous.  \n\nFrank\u2019s wife, Estelle, died during childbirth.  And he said to Peter (sometimes with me in the room) that he treasured the experience of raising him as a single father.  Not only that, but he would go on to say how badly he wanted that experience for Peter.  \n\nThat\u2019s right.  With me in the room, he said how great it would be if I died during childbirth.  \n\nI wanted to flip out on him, of course.  I wanted to yell and scream.  But when I stood up from the stool at the kitchen counter where we had been sitting all the strength drained out of my legs.  I suddenly felt dizzy and had to sit back down.  I couldn't even find my voice to yell at him.\n\nI would have thought Peter would be concerned, but he didn\u2019t seem to notice.  He went on smiling and nodding his head at what his father was saying - as if it was completely normal to talk in positive tones about me being dead.  \n\nLater that night I brought it up, trying to keep my voice even and trying not to explode.  Peter told me he didn\u2019t even remember his father saying that, and if he did he probably didn\u2019t mean anything by it.  Of course, Peter can\u2019t help but defend him no matter what.  \n\nI spent weeks trying to forget about it and put it out of my mind, but it was impossible.  The more I thought about it the more I started to worry that Frank was somehow going to make it happen.  I know, that sounds delusional, but you don\u2019t know this man.  When he wants something - he gets his way.  \n\nFrank keeps insisting that he be allowed in the Delivery Room.  I\u2019ve told Peter I don\u2019t want him there but he won\u2019t listen.  He says his father has every right to be there for the birth of his grandchild.  But I have a terrible feeling about it.  Despite my presence, he continues talking about how he can\u2019t wait for Peter to have the magical experience of raising a child as a single father.  It will be difficult, he says, but with his help Peter will get through it.  \n\nTo be clear, there\u2019s been no talk of complications or issues with the pregnancy.  I\u2019ve checked with the doctor again and again, ensuring I\u2019m not missing anything.  But she keeps telling me the baby is healthy and all signs point to a normal delivery in the near future.\n\nBut regardless of that, Frank continues talking about it all as if I will be dead following the birth of our child.  And he keeps insisting that he be allowed in the room on that day.  I\u2019ve told Peter \u201cno\u201d a hundred times, but he doesn\u2019t listen.   \n\nThe worst part is, I can imagine it all perfectly.  I can see Frank in the Delivery Room, telling the nurses and doctors what to do.  Telling them to give me an extra shot of morphine, or to turn off the oxygen, or something.  And every time I SEE THEM LISTENING.  And doing exactly what he says!  I don\u2019t know how the hell he\u2019s going to do it but he will make it happen.  He wants me dead and he wants it to happen in that room, while I'm giving birth.  He's demented - he must be - but I can tell just by looking at his face when he talks about it.  I know that's what he's planning.\n\nThe baby is kicking right now and I\u2019m trying to soothe her by rubbing my belly but it isn't working.  Funny, I keep picturing the baby as a girl even though we haven't gotten the sex confirmed.  We wanted to keep it as a surprise.  But part of me thinks I\u2019ll never find out for sure.  I\u2019ll be dead before I ever see my baby\u2019s face.  \n\nI need to calm down somehow and think.  \n\nThere\u2019s no way I can sleep tonight.  Maybe talking to a friend about this will help.  Recording this message did nothing but make me more anxious for my delivery date.\n\n*\n\nHoly shit.\n\nThings are so much worse than I thought.  \n\nThe cops can\u2019t help me.  I know that now.  Nobody can help me.  I\u2019m completely fucked!\n\nOh God, I\u2019m gonna die.  He\u2019s gonna have me killed or he\u2019s gonna have me kill myself just like he did to Sarah.  \n\nOh fuck.\n\nSlow down.  Start from the beginning.  Explain it.  Get it all down.  Maybe this will reach the FBI or someone after I\u2019m gone.  Maybe someone can stop that son of a bitch.\n\nOkay, deep breaths.  \n\nI went to see my friend Sarah, right after I finished typing out that first section.  I thought that would be it.  But something happened after I got to Sarah\u2019s place, before I had time to explain everything. \n\nThere was a knock on the front door and she went to answer it.  I followed her, a part of me worried that I knew exactly who was on the other side of that door. \n\nSure enough, standing out there on the porch was Frank.  \n\n\u201cI had a feeling you\u2019d be here,\u201d he said, seeing me standing behind Sarah.  \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I come in, do you?\u201d \n\nSarah let him in reluctantly, looking like she didn\u2019t really want to but had no choice.  \n\nHe shut the door behind him and the three of us stood in the foyer, looking at each other.  There were several long moments of silence and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, a bead of sweat pouring down the side of my face as I watched him and waited to see what he would do.  \n\nFor some reason, I had a feeling of impending doom like none I\u2019d ever felt before.  \n\nHis old face had wrinkles but was somehow smooth at the same time, as if he didn\u2019t really age but was just pretending to.  Like a baby-face scrunched up to give the impression of lines.  \n\nI wondered for the first time if this man was a demon or some other supernatural being.  How else could he do the things he did?  How else could he make all that money from getting inside people\u2019s heads?  Even now he could make everyone around him dance to his tune, and do everything he wanted.  How else could you do something like that, if not by magic?\n\nHe clicked his tongue and his eyes moved back and forth like someone watching a tennis match, as he looked silently from Sarah then to me.  The movement of his eyes was hypnotizing, slow and steady, and I found myself watching him and feeling drowsy.  My eyelids drooped and became heavier, as I stared at him intently.   \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dry in here isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked.  I wasn\u2019t sure how much time had passed, but it might have been a while.    \n\nAs soon as he said those words my throat felt parched.  My mouth had been sapped of all moisture.  It wasn\u2019t just dry - it was a desert.  I couldn\u2019t even form words.  Looking over at Sarah I saw she had the same horrified expression on her face.  \n\n\u201cYou need a drink of water,\u201d he told us.  \u201cWithout that you\u2019ll die.\u201d\n\nThe thought that he could be right raced through my mind, competing with another which told me not to believe him - he was the devil.  He was the prince of lies.  \n\nBut I couldn\u2019t resist and neither could Sarah.  I ran to the kitchen while she ran to the bathroom nearby, putting her head beneath the faucet and opening her mouth wide.  \n\nWhen I was in the kitchen at the sink I found myself under the faucet, head tilted upwards, guzzling water down in greedy gulps.  \n\nI didn\u2019t hear him enter the kitchen, coming up behind me until he was standing only a few inches away.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough for now,\u201d said Frank from behind me after another second or two.  \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want to hurt Peter\u2019s baby.\u201d\n\nI pulled my head back from the faucet, feeling like I'd nearly drowned as I slumped down to the floor, in a daze and not really understanding what had just happened at first.\n\nFrank stood over me, looking down at me as if I were a worm.  \n\nHe explained to me how there was no sense trying to save myself.  There was no sense trying to tell the police or my friends and family.  He was in my head.  He knew what I was going to do before I did it.  And if I tried to tell anyone what he was capable of he would do to them exactly what he did to Sarah.  And then he would do much worse things to me.    \n\nHe said he knew of ways.  Things that would hurt me but not the baby.  \n\n\"What did you do to Sarah?\" I asked him, tears streaming from my eyes.  \"What did you do to her!?\"\n\nHe didn't answer.  Instead, he walked out quietly and left me on the kitchen floor.  \n\nThe only sounds in the house were of me crying and of the faucet in the washroom still running.  \n\nI stumbled into the bathroom on shaky legs to find Sarah there, her jaw somehow still clamped down on the tasteful designer faucet she had shown off to me when she had the bathroom renovated several months before.  She had died at some point very recently.  \n\nHer face was pale and blue-tinged, bloated and weeping water from the pores.  She looked like a bullfrog - her neck swollen and too big - her shirt collar buttons popped off from the pressure.  Thin blue veins stood out everywhere on her pale skin, creating a grotesque appearance that was difficult to look at.  This wasn\u2019t Sarah anymore - her spirit was gone and now this was just a bloated, waterlogged husk of flesh.    \n\nShe had gotten up onto the vanity in the bathroom and contorted herself so she was lying face up beneath the tap - the water pouring out at full blast.  \n\nI turned off the faucet and pulled her down from that horrifying position.  I tried to do CPR, calling 911 on my phone, using the speaker to blubber to the dispatcher, trying to explain what had happened.  For whatever reason, I left out any mention of Frank.    \n\nNothing I did was of any use.  Sarah was long gone.  \n\nThe official cause of death was suicide by means of hypervolemia and water asphyxiation.  I'm sure it was probably one of the first instances in recorded history of such an event.  The EMS workers looked rightfully horrified, and even the police detective who questioned me was pale and slightly gray, as if he could throw up at any second after seeing her body.    \n\nI was tempted to tell him the truth about what had happened.  But I didn't.  Maybe that makes me a coward.  Maybe I'm under the influence of Frank just like everyone else.  I don't really know.  \n\nAll I know is that my best friend is dead now and that bastard made it happen.  He told her to drink and she did - she turned on the tap and let it run down her throat until she drowned on it.  \n  \nMy delivery date is coming up.  Frank is going to be there.  I know that no matter what I say he will find a way into that room.  \n\nHe will be there, and he is going to kill me.  \n\nIf you\u2019re reading this - please, tell whoever you can.  \n\nMy name is Amanda Marks.  And I'm going to be killed by Frank Marks - AKA Francis Folds.  \n\nHe'll tell the doctors and nurses to kill me and they'll do it.  But it won't be their fault.  No one can say no to Frank.\n\nIf you want to stop him - you better shoot him on [sight.](https://youtube.com/@JordanGrupe)\n\n[JG](https://www.reddit.com/r/JGcreepypastas?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[TCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)",

Even with that, I'd still run. Move to another country, disappear. Though it would be hard, consider giving the child up for adoption... or better yet, drop the baby off at a hospital's entrance &amp; take off if that service is offered. Adoption might be traced. There are states in the US that offer Safe Haven drop-offs. You can hide your face from cameras &amp; nothing is traced. The baby will be well cared for.",

Now I get it, you wanted the baby, but hear me out. It needs to be done. You don't want him around it do you? You can't let a man like that get what he wants right? If you aren't even to 28 weeks yet, the baby doesn't even have a functioning brain yet so you don't even have to feel bad about it. You're more valuable than a fetus or the thing you're married to and it's paternal genetic donor. It's so sad your mother didn't teach you these things. I taught my daughter never to have feelings for mama's boys, and a daddy's boy is the same. I taught her it's ok to love one of them (males) but don't love one more than you love yourself, it gets you into trouble and you ignore red flags. I also taught her not to fall in love with things you can't see. That goes for fetuses and imaginary deities. \n\nI'd love to help you with your problem but it does require going scorched earth for real. You don't sound cynical, stubborn and rebellious enough to go against this guy yet. If you can't hear the guy can he still control you?",

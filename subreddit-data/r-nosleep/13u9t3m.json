    "postText": "Growing up, I remember it all vividly: any time my friends or I got too close to the shed, my dad would come out hollering and yelling, telling us to stay away from there and that it was no place for kids. He told me he had expensive tools and dangerous chemicals stored there. As a child, I didn\u2019t question it. It was just one of those things. In my mind, I had been born into a world where the sun rises in the east, breakfast is the first meal of the day and the shed stays locked. They were all true, self-evident and simply the way things existed in my young mind.\n\n\nBut as I grew older and eventually moved off to college, I began to question the shed more. My father still wouldn\u2019t let me look in there. In fact, he kept the sole key on his person at all times. Even when he slept, he would keep the key in his pocket.\n\n\nThen, during my second semester at the nearby state university, I got a call that every son or daughter dreads. I was attending a lecture on anatomy when my phone lit up, ringing silently in the great, crowded hall. Looking down, I saw it was my brother\u2019s number. I went outside, lighting up a cigarette and answering it.\n\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d I said. \u201cGil?\u201d My brother answered immediately.\n\n\n\u201cLuke, thank God you answered,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s dad. He\u2019s being taken to the hospital. He had some sort of medical emergency. Can you meet us there? In maybe twenty-five minutes?\u201d I said I would, hanging up. I grabbed my stuff in the lecture hall and made my way to my car. Twenty-two minutes later, I pulled into the hospital.\n\n\nIt was too late, however. My father had died of a heart attack on the way. He was declared dead on arrival.\n\n\n\\***\n\n\nWe ended up inheriting the house. Our mother had died of breast cancer ten years earlier, so Gil and I were the last two of the Mortin bloodline. My brother was a good guy, though somewhat of a waste case, constantly smoking weed and dropping acid. He had a tendency to travel out far across the country without notice, moving around to see nature or go to music festivals. That is, when he had the money. And since he worked as a freelance writer, he was often broke.\n\n\nHe really wanted to get at the money dad had left us. He wanted the money from the house most of all. He told me repeatedly that it would be enough to tide him over until he got a footing in the writing industry, that he just needed to make a name for himself and then the money would start rolling in. He had his heart set on it. He would write anything that he could make money off of, from horror stories to romances, short stories to novels, even technical manuals or freelance journalism articles. As we walked to the house together for the first time in months, he repeated this mantra to me again: \u201cJust enough to tide me over, Luke\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re probably going to burn through the money that Dad left you,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a real job and just write on the side?\u201d He gave me a sideways look.\n\n\n\u201cDid you see Hunter S. Thompson getting a \u2018real job\u2019 while just writing on the side?\u201d he asked. I nodded.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, he was a journalist\u2026\u201d I began as we walked into the house, but we both stopped simultaneously when we saw what was on the coffee table. It was all of Dad\u2019s possessions he had when he died. They were placed neatly in a line- his wallet, his phone, his car and house key, some cash, and last of all, a little shed key on a thin, leather chain.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you think is really in that shed?\u201d I asked. Gil looked at me, pale and wide-eyed in the dark living room.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I want to find out,\u201d Gil said, whispering as if he were in a church- or a funeral home. I put my hand on his shoulder and shook him gently.\n\n\n\u201cOf course we need to find out,\u201d I said. \u201cYou and I own this property now. We should go look right now.\u201d He breathed in sharply.\n\n\n\u201cNo, no, don\u2019t be an idiot,\u201d Gil whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s dark now. In the morning, we can go together. In the morning. You have waited twenty years to find out, I think you can wait a few more hours.\u201d But there was something pleading in his voice, something scared and child-like. It reminded me of when I was scared as a little boy at bedtime, telling my dad there were monsters in the closet, and he would go to open up the door, and I\u2019d tell him to stop, that they\u2019re going to hurt him if he opens that door. But he would open the door and there would be no monsters in there. Surely, it was the same here. Gil would see, and for that matter, so would I. There were no monsters in there.\n\n\n\\***\n\n\nThis all happened from yesterday to this morning. We ended up leaving that place together a few hours ago, bloodied and bruised and injured, after being trapped inside all night.\n\n\nThe day before it started, Gil stayed up late downstairs, watching TV and smoking a joint. He made himself a night-cap from my father\u2019s liquor cabinet, pouring some Jack Daniels and ice in a cup with some Coke and sipping it slowly. I stayed with him for a while, talking.\n\n\nWe talked about the good times we had with Dad, about going hiking with him at the Green Mountains, or traveling to New York City with him to see the museums. I thought about how much I really missed him, and a knot formed in my throat. I quickly blinked my eyes to try to get the tears to go away.\n\n\nEventually, I went to sleep in the guest bedroom. Gil stayed downstairs, sleeping on the couch in front of the TV. I heard the faint hum of it from upstairs, the canned laughter of whatever comedy he was watching, the acerbic tone of the lead characters as they delivered one witty joke after another. I fell asleep to it, the voices blending into a sarcastic, hissing whisper in my ear. \n\n\nAnd then I was floating, bodiless, looking down on a dark cornfield with ravens staring at me. The voice was bodiless, too, sounding like it came from right behind me, but when I turned, nothing was there.\n\n\n\u201cIn the halls of our fathers, everyone is dead,\u201d it whispered mockingly. \u201cYou\u2019ll be dead soon too, if you get curious. Some doors are locked for a reason. Some doors should *stay locked*.\u201d\n\n\nI woke up suddenly. Something was wrong. I heard Gil yelling. I fumbled around in the dark for the lamp, groggily checking the time. 4:17 AM. Flinging the comforters off, I ran downstairs.\n\n\nGil was sleeping on the couch, still as a corpse, and quiet as one too. I looked around confusedly. Where was the screaming coming from? I followed the noise out back. I looked at the shed, and my blood ran cold as I heard another long cry come from inside. I walked across the dirt yard in my slippers, not wanting to get any closer but walking forwards nonetheless. Part of me wondered if I was still dreaming, but the chill air against my sweaty face felt real enough.\n\n\nThe screaming from the shed was not in words. It was a long, drawn-out, painful shriek. It was the shriek of a mother who just lost her only child in a war zone, or the yell of someone doused with gasoline and burned alive, but amplified into an ear-splitting cacophony. I had the key in my pocket. I reached for it with shaking hands, pulling it out, slowly approaching the shed.\n\n\nThen someone grabbed my shoulder. I jumped, whirling around with clenched fists, ready to fight. Then I saw it was Gil.\n\n\n\u201cYou nearly gave me a heart attack,\u201d I said through clenched teeth. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d He put his finger to his lips, the universal signal for silence. Then he leaned close to my ear and whispered.\n\n\n\u201cIf you open that shed now, we will both die,\u201d he said quietly and calmly, as if he were just stating the weather for tomorrow. \u201cPut the key away and go back to bed. You never want to open it in the dark. *Never*.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you know about it?\u201d I whispered back, shooting glances over my shoulder at the shed. The screaming still came, though slower now, maybe one heart-rending shriek every minute or so. Part of me was glad there were no neighbors for half a mile in each direction, and that made me want to laugh. There was probably some horrific animal in there that would rip me apart if it got the chance, and I was thinking about noise complaints.\n\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Gil repeated, gently taking my arm and leading me back into the house. I sat next to him in the living room, pouring myself a gin and tonic, sipping it slowly as the screams from behind the house mixed with the canned laughter of the TV show, wondering what kind of man my father really was.\n\n\n\\***\n\n\nI woke on the couch, an empty glass falling out of my hand onto the cushion. Light streamed in through the windows. Gil was nowhere to be found. I looked back and forth, then heard the sizzling of food from the kitchen.\n\n\nStumbling in, I saw he had prepared a massive breakfast of bacon, sausages, corned beef hash, eggs Benedict with Hollandaise sauce, Texas toast, orange juice and coffee. He was smoking a joint with the windows opened, occasionally sending a grim look out the back of the house towards the shed. I sat down, pouring myself some coffee and grabbing milk and sugar to mix in.\n\n\n\u201cWho is all this food for?\u201d I asked. He kept staring out the window. \u201cHey!\u201d He turned suddenly, his face looking pale and drawn.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI said, who is all this food for?\u201d I repeated. He looked around, smiling.\n\n\n\u201cJust for us. Why not? I figure you will need the energy today, and so will I,\u201d he said cryptically. He sat down across from me, pouring himself coffee and orange juice and grabbing a plateful of meat, toast and eggs. I did the same, giving him occasional glances. \n\n\n\u201cWhat did Dad tell you?\u201d I asked, pouring maple syrup on my sausages and bacon and chugging an entire cup of coffee in one long swallow. It burned my throat, but the rising heat and caffeine made me feel instantly better and more awake. Gil sighed heavily.\n\n\n\u201cNot much, to tell you the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was really drunk one time when you were away at college, a couple months ago. He was drinking more and more before he died, like something was weighing on him, something he wanted to forget. Well, anyway, I was sitting down here with him, watching those documentaries he used to love with him, and during a commercial, he just started talking about the shed.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Now boy,\u2019 he said to me, \u2018I know you probably have a few questions for me. I probably should have told you and your brother about it a long time ago, but it is something I don\u2019t like to talk about. Out of sight, out of mind, I guess. I think talking about it tends to wake it up.\u2019\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Wake up what?\u2019 I said. Dad was quiet for a long time, just staring at me. Then he leaned close to me and whispered something strange.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018The stairs,\u2019 he said. \u2018They\u2019re not normal, son. Sometimes they go down below the shed to a\u2026 Well, I guess it is just an empty sub-floor. Just a plain, swept dirt basement below the shed. But I never built any such sub-floor, and it wasn\u2019t here when I bought the house, and it isn\u2019t on the plans either. If that was it, then who would care? Hah, a free storage place, people would be happy, right?\u2019 I nodded, grinning back at Dad. He seemed to have a glimmer of his old self for a second, happy and free. But then his face darkened again.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018But lots of times, boy, those stairs do not lead to a sub-floor. One time, they led down to a white room covered in blood, with bright fluorescent lights flickering all over the walls and ceiling. And there was a little girl down there, dancing among all the blood, jumping and twirling in her little blue dress, little ballerina slippers on her feet, and all the skin on her face peeled off. She was just a bloody, grinning skull. And when she saw me on the spiral steps in the corner, she stopped dancing and just stared. The lights began to turn off, everything went dark, and I ran, my boy, I ran faster than I have ever run in my life. I felt little hands grabbing at me as I made my way up the last stair and slammed that shed door behind me. I locked it as something fought to get out, something that felt far stronger than any child. And that was just one time.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s worse at night. That\u2019s when the real dangerous ones come out. I don\u2019t know how the stairs work, son, and I don\u2019t think I ever really want to. Maybe if you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll never have to deal with them. Maybe I\u2019ll find a way to destroy them before I die. Aye, maybe\u2026\u2019\u201d Gil stopped speaking, deep in thought and remembrance. I took another sip of juice and ate some bacon before responding.\n\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me Dad went batshit crazy before he died?\u201d I asked. Gil shook his head quickly.\n\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t crazy, Luke,\u201d he said simply. \u201cAt least, I don\u2019t think he was. If he was, the stairs probably made him that way. Do you really think that you were just hearing a fox or something caught in the shed last night? Those screams sounded *human*. We both know that was something unnatural. But I wouldn\u2019t worry if I were you. If you need proof, we\u2019ll have plenty after today- assuming you still want to go into the shed.\u201d And after we finished eating, with no fanfare or delay, we did. I grabbed the key, and Gil and I went out side by side, scared but not showing it, ready to finally see for ourselves the mystery that had haunted our family for decades.\n\n\n\\***\n\n\nWe walked through the hard-packed dirt yard, looking down the grassy field behind the house to the rolling hills that stretched as far as the eye could see. They began to grow blue, pale and fuzzy near the horizon. It was a beautiful place to live, and hard to imagine something so evil might be right in the middle of it.\n\n\nThe shed loomed up ahead of us, boards tightly hammered together and freshly painted a dark red color. The shingles on the small roof all looked relatively new, and the door was expensive and sturdy. I stood in front of the door, listening for the sounds of any movement, but there was nothing. I fumbled in my pocket for the key, pulling it out, looking at Gil who stood close by my side. Then I shoved it in the lock and opened the door.\n\n\nThe shed was dark, as if a curtain of shadow fell across the open door. I stuck my head in, feeling around the side for a lightswitch. And that was when something grabbed my hand. I screamed, ready to pull my hand out and run, and then I felt the lightswitch on the wall. I flicked it on quickly. There was no one in there. Shaking, I turned to Gil.\n\n\n\u201cSomething grabbed me,\u201d I whispered. He nodded, unsurprised. Then we walked in the shed together.\n\n\nThe walls inside were all covered with plates of sheet metal. Every square inch of the shed was reinforced with steel, including the roof, which had a flat pane of metal going straight across the shed, welded to the four that covered the walls. Only the floor was unprotected. It was just a plain dirt floor with a hole in the center.\n\n\nLooking closer at the protective structure of the shed, I saw deep claw and gouge marks raking the metal\u2019s surface, even those on the bottom of the ceiling eight feet above the floor. Something had clearly been in here and wanted very badly to get out.\n\n\nI inched closer to the hole in the floor, which took up most of the floor of the shed. It was at least ten feet wide. Looking down, I saw spiraling steps, descending in a clockwise fashion as far down as the light extended. I found a small rock on the ground outside, came back in and dropped it down the center of the stairway. I listened for it to hit bottom, counting the seconds on my watch. After about thirty seconds, I realized it wasn\u2019t going to. Maybe it was too far down to hear when the stone connected.\n\n\nI looked over at Gil. He was standing as near to the door as he could get, looking like he would rather be anywhere else in the world. I gave him high marks for courage, though. There was something wrong in here, and I could feel it. Outside, it was warm and a fresh breeze blew the smell of flowers and pines through the yard. But in here, it was cold and oppressive. A freezing chill seemed to come from the hole in the floor, spiraling up with the stairs and running over my body, sending a feeling like ice running up and down my back.\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you want to go first, or should I?\u201d I said, gesturing to the hole. Gil stared at me as if I had gone mad, his eyes widening.\n\n\n\u201cWhy in the fuck should either of us go?\u201d he said, raising his hands and using them to gesticulate wildly as he often did when he was upset. I shrugged.\n\n\n\u201cThis is our property now,\u201d I said. \u201cWe need to at least know what\u2019s on it, don\u2019t you think?\u201d But there was another reason too. It was sheer curiosity, and a desire to prove to myself that there was nothing supernatural going on here, no monster in the closet, just the overactive imagination of an old man. Gil sighed.\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll go. Go grab two flashlights and Dad\u2019s gun. Maybe some extra batteries. Some extra magazines too. Better safe than sorry, after all\u2026\u201d\n\n\nWe both went inside the house together, leaving the shed door wide open, and that was when, I believe, something got out. And then the killings in town began.\n\n\n\\***\n\n\nWe descended the stairs slowly. They were stone, slick in some places. There was no guard rail or any protective barrier, which made my heart beat a little faster. I liked something to hold onto. If I took a tumble on these stairs, I might keep falling forever.\n\n\nWe heard strange sounds from below periodically, but when we shone our lights down there, we couldn't see anything. Echoes rose around us, sounding at one point like kids playing a game of hide and seek, at another like the howling of a wolf. Strange squeaks and clicks would also arise intermittently from the shaft below us, and then stop as quickly as they had started.\n\n\nThe noises got louder as we descended dozens of stories, then hundreds. It seemed like the stairs would just keep going on forever, until we hit the mantle of the Earth and got burned up. Then a door appeared, painted a chipped blue with a fading daisy on the center of it. I looked at Gil, then swung it open.\n\n\nBeyond it, a hallway with fluorescent lights extended as far as the eye could see. Countless rooms went off it to the left and right. The lights flickered on and off, sending portions of the hallway into darkness. The floor was falling apart in many places, with strange molds and fungi growing out of the wood. White and black molds battled for space, forming huge colonies that were bigger than my shoe. I walked forward, putting my weight gingerly on the floorboard. It creaked slightly and felt wet under my shoe, yet it held my weight.\n\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d I said to Gil, who followed closely behind. As soon as we had walked a few steps down the hall, the door slammed shut by itself behind us. I jumped and turned, pulling out the gun reflexively. Gil put a hand on my shoulder, pushing the gun back down.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d he said. I was breathing hard, my heart hammering in my chest. Maybe that was why I didn\u2019t hear the counting at first.\n\n\nBut as we walked down the decayed hallway, the lights turning on and off above us with every step, I realized that someone was counting, and it had been going on for a while. It sounded like the voice of a little girl.\n\n\n\u201cForty\u2026 thirty-nine\u2026 thirty-eight\u2026\u201d she said, counting off the seconds. I heard giggling from the rooms around us, but I couldn\u2019t see anyone. We kept walking forward, but that counting was getting on my nerves- not least because I couldn\u2019t for the life of me tell where it was coming from.\n\n\nWe checked the rooms to the left and the right. There were broken tables, old office equipment and chairs in nearly all of them. Some of them had fish tanks, but instead of fish, they had plumes of multi-colored molds growing over the top of them, or, in one case, a dead and dried-out turtle.\n\n\n\u201c...one\u2026 ready or not, here I come!\u201d the girl\u2019s voice screamed gleefully, and that was when all the lights went out at once. We quickly fumbled for our flashlights, turning them on at the same time. I had the gun in one hand crisscrossed with the flashlight in the other, a trick I had seen used in cop shows. Gil had a ten-inch bowie knife in one hand, which he had just removed from the massive scabbard he had it in around his leg. In his other hand, he held the flashlight, which he frantically shone back and forth, up and down.\n\n\n\u201cGeez, calm down with that thing,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make me dizzy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSomething\u2019s coming,\u201d Gil whispered, a note of dread in his voice. \u201cDon\u2019t you hear it?\u201d I stopped, listening hard. Indeed, I heard footsteps nearing, small suppressed giggles, the swishing of a dress. My flashlight illuminated a pale face, a little boy sneaking a peak out of the nearest room. He was filthy, covered in black soot with torn clothing and what looked like blood caked into his hair. He looked up at us quickly then withdrew into the room. For the first time, I felt genuinely scared. Now we could be certain we were being watched.\n\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d I whispered, running into the room after him. Gil followed close behind me. The footsteps seemed to be right next to us now, but I looked around, not seeing anyone. Then a blur of movement passed by as a little girl ran over to the little boy, where he was curled in the corner under a broken folding table, crying and shaking with terror.\n\n\n\u201cFound you!\u201d she said. I shone my light directly at her back, seeing a pale blue dress, but I couldn\u2019t see her face.\n\n\n\u201cGet away from that kid!\u201d I yelled. She ignored me, bending down quickly, and before I knew what had happened, she had ripped the boy\u2019s throat out with her teeth. She turned to look at us, and I saw that her face had been cut off, and now only a grinning skull remained. It was covered in a thin sheen of blood, and two tiny white pinpoints of light seemed to glow inside the empty sockets of her eyes. With her teeth full of flesh and gristle and fresh rivulets of blood running down her skeletal mouth, she continued to cry, \u201cFound you! Found you! Found you!\u201d\n\n\nWithout hesitation, I shot her in the shoulder. She fell back a half-step, turning to look at me with that skeletal grin, then spun around and continued eating the little boy. He was still alive, choking on his own blood, his huge eyes moving over to me as he died, as if accusing me of being the cause of all this. The sound of his last gurgling breaths were the only sounds now. I shot her again, but she wouldn\u2019t go down. A blossom of blood began to spread outwards on her back where I had shot her, but she showed no pain. Gil grabbed my shoulder tightly.\n\n\n\u201cWe need to get out of here,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. I nodded. We ran back to the door we had come in through, but it was locked tight. The lights were still off. I told Gil to take a step back, then tried shooting at the lock. The bullet ricocheted crazily as if I had shot a reinforced army tank rather than a plain wooden doorway. Next we tried kicking it open, but it was as if it were fused to the wall.\n\n\nI turned to look at him, and the truth passed between us in a glimpse. To get out, we would have to go farther in, where there were likely even worse things waiting for us.\n\n\n\nPart 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13vycj7/my_father_always_kept_the_shed_locked_today_i/",

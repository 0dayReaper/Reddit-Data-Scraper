    "postText": "______\n\nI can\u2019t bare to put down into words what happened [when](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13mzgy4/im_trapped_in_a_basement_elevator_alongside/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=15) Nick chose to end his life. \n\nWhen his body crumpled to the ground, Chlo\u00e9 wailed. \n\nPhil comforted her and I felt the need to vomit. \n\nHis body was just a lump of flesh now, bits of tissue and blood splattered all over the wall made me feel dizzy but I couldn\u2019t bare to keep looking so I placed my head against the other wall and closed my eyes. \n\nPhil finally made a move and I opened my eyes to see him dragging Nick\u2019s body toward the door. \n\n He made the sign of the cross and waited for the roar of the monster. \n\nAs it got close, he pushed Nick over the edge. \n\nChlo\u00e9 stifled a scream as we heard Nick\u2019s body hit the wall of the elevator shaft, tumbling into the void below. The monster changed course and the elevator buckled as it rushed by, eager to consume the soldier. \n\n Nick was gone, but his final words and dark thoughts lingered in the air as I looked toward the bloody mess where the gun was laying. \n\nI picked it up and looked at the bullets left in the chamber. Still enough for all of us. \n\n\u201cMaybe he was right,\u201d I said as I held the gun next to me. \n\n\u201cWhat if we are wasting our time fighting this?\u201d I asked. \n\nThe elevator rattles as we keep ascending. Nothing to stop us now from whatever we run into. And the thought of impending doom makes me want to pull the trigger. \n\nPhil extends his burnt hand out to take the gun. I hesitate, but I give it to him. Then he tosses it out into the void as well. \n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to die here. I don\u2019t care what anyone says. We matter. And we will fight to our dying breath.\u201d\n\nThat seems to put an end to the existential discussion and all of us sit on the only wall that isn\u2019t damaged as the elevator continues to rise. \n\nI use the time to make sure my phone has fully charged and I take account of what supplies were left in Nick\u2019s bag. \n\nTwo bottles of water and 1 pound of ground Turkey. \n\nThen I find the briefcase and I recall his warning about it. \n\nI considered sliding it right out the open door, but curiosity got the better of me and I ask Phil to use one of his tools to try and get it open. \n\n\u201cNothing good is going to come from that,\u201d he wisely says. But I need a distraction and I\u2019m desperate for meaning in this abyss. I finally manage to snap the case open and I see something that makes my heart drop. \n\nIt looks like two blocks of c2 explosives and immediately I push the case away. \n\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d Phil said, nervously sliding the box toward the door. \n\n\u201cWait. Wait, don't do that. If you drop it, even while we are ascending it could explode and kill us,\u201d I told him cautiously as I took the case back and looked down at the bombs. \n\n\u201cIt survived the drop earlier,\u201d Phil argues. \n\n\u201cBut look at the damage to the case. One more bad hit and\u2026 boom,\u201d I tell him, my heart pounding as I realize Nick was serious about his awful intentions. His guilt was plain as day. \n\n\u201cHe really was planning to end it all, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d I realize. \n\n\u201cAnd possibly take out others in the process. What a sad man,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 said. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why anyone would do something like that,\u201d I admitted. I check the box for anything else and notice a slip of paper stuck under the mesh in the corner of the case. \n\nTaking it out I realize it\u2019s the note I saw during that first night. I couldn\u2019t read it clearly in the darkness but now at last I realize it\u2019s a suicide note. \n\n*Every single choice has been taken from me. My job while I was overseas. My family too. What did I serve for? Why did I come home? It\u2019s all meaningless. This place holds no value to me anymore. Nothing does. I\u2019ve realized now that I will be gone now and I will be forgotten. All of us will. Our entire lives will be nothing in the grand scheme of things. How much time is left? Maybe less than minutes as I get ready to ride the elevator to the only choice I get to have. I\u2019ll make my name be remembered. Those who took what I care about will remember me.*\n\nBelow the note I see that he scratched my name out and I guess that meant he figured that I was the one that had taken his job. Reading the anger and frustration of this sad man makes me almost empathize with his pain. But I can\u2019t endorse his vision of hurting others. \n\nI try to think of how he seemed hesitant to be close to any of us and I realize his conscience must have bothered him once he knew we were trapped. \n\n\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d Chlo\u00e9 asks. \n\nI crumple up the note and toss it to the void as the elevator continues to ride. \u201cHe was right. We were better off not knowing.\u201d \n\n\u201cSo he was really going to hurt people?\u201d she asks. \n\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s why he was so cagey. I think he wanted to help\u2026 but an internal struggle kept him from really getting help for himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I knew. Maybe he realized his mistake. It sounded like he had a lot of issues to work out,\u201d I told her. \n\n\u201cWe can remember him for his sacrifice. Maybe it will help us to make it to the top,\u201d Phil says.\n\nNone of us says a word and I finally have no energy to think anymore, closing my eyes as I listen to the hum of machinery as we keep going up. \n\nUPDATE \n\nI have no idea how much time has passed. The elevator is moving slowly but we are still going up. The warped metal walls and broken flooring make me uneasy as each shake and rattle threatens to make our metal cage fall apart. Somehow luck is on our side for now as we keep ascending. \n\nBut that isn\u2019t why I am updating these notes. \n\nWhen I woke up I realized that I was staring at the blood on the wall and I had no idea how it got there. I checked my notes and saw the mention of the army private named Nick that killed himself so that we could try to escape. \n\nBut even though I know I wrote this down, I have no memory of his face or anything that transpired. \n\nThe notes mention others too, and I feel a pang of guilt cover my body as I realize I have forgotten them as well. I tell Chlo\u00e9 this and she admits the same. \n\n\u201cWhen that creature devours someone, it takes away our memory of them. It\u2019s feeding on that,\u201d she speculated. \n\nWe sit in the bright elevator for another hour and listen to it continue to rise, tension still high despite the chance we have of escape. \n\nSuddenly Chlo\u00e9 begins to cry and she starts to open her phone. But it\u2019s dead. \n\n\u201cThe charger, give me the charger,\u201d she says frantically. I don\u2019t understand what is happening but I agree and let her use it. \n\nShe rocks back and forth and waits for her phone to come back to life. I watch speechless as she opens up her photo albums and scrolls through her pictures. \n\nThen I see tears roll down her cheek and she throws her phone on the floor. \n\n\u201cHey. What is wrong?\u201d I ask in confusion as she balls up her fists. \n\n\u201cMy children\u2026\u201d she says between sobs and I look at the cracked phone, recalling her desire to be reunited with them. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see them soon,\u201d I tell her. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not it Eli\u2026. I\u2019ve forgotten them,\u201d she said, trying to not wail. \n\n\u201cI look at memories of them and they mean nothing to me. Nothing,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 said. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to say, but I try to keep her calm as Phil wakes from his sleep. \n\n\u201cWhat kind of mother am I that I can\u2019t even remember my own children?!\u201d She asks. \n\n\u201cHey\u2026 what\u2019s going on?\u201d the maintenance man mutters as he hears the noise. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s this place\u2026 it\u2019s wearing down on our sanity. Taking what matters to us the most\u2026\u201d I told him. \n\n\u201cWhat if I forget that I even have children at all?\u201d Chlo\u00e9 whispers. \n\n\u201cThat won\u2019t happen,\u201d I told her. \n\n\u201cBut it already is happening! Don\u2019t you see? Before too long we will even forget who we are,\u201d she squeals. \n\n\u201cEnough of this talk. You\u2019ll see your children again soon,\u201d Phil tells her. \n\n\u201cBut what if they have forgotten me the same way I have forgotten them? What kind of a reunion is that? We won\u2019t even recognize each other. It will be meaningless,\u201d she screams. \n\n\u201cNew memories. It will work. We have to believe it will work out,\u201d I tell her. But she is beginning to hyperventilate and I turn to Phil for an answer. \n\nHe checks the backpack and we take out what the soldier had for medical supplies. Including a sedative. \n\nChlo\u00e9 sees what we are looking at and shakes her head. \u201cWhat are you thinking of doing to me?\u201d \n\n\u201cWe just want you to remain calm so you can make it out of here,\u201d Phil tells her. \n\nShe immediately stands up and takes off her high heels, using the sharp end to wave it toward us as a weapon. Her bare feet are soaked in blood as she demands we stay away from her. \n\n\u201cChlo\u00e9 please we just want to help,\u201d I tell her. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know who you are!!\u201d she screams out. \n\nIn that moment of hesitation, we see a chance and I grab her from the left and Phil goes to the right. He plunges the syringe into her neck and used half of the vial. \n\n I see her eyes roll back. Then we let her body down to the floor and I sigh in relief. \n\n\u201cShe won\u2019t forgive us for that,\u201d I tell him. \n\n\u201cShe will when she sees her kids again,\u201d Phil argues. \n\nThe lights flicker and the elevator shutters again, my heart skipping a beat. But we continue to ascend. I relax and look across the elevator to the open door. \n\n\u201cYou really think we will get out of here?\u201d I ask. \n\nBut Phil has already closed his eyes to go back to sleep. I lay there for about ten minutes longer and then decide to do the same. But I am frightened about what I will forget next, and Chlo\u00e9\u2019s panic is beginning to infect my mind. \n\nWhat if the end result is no different than the beginning? \n\nIt\u2019s the most dreadful thought I\u2019ve dared to have. \n\nAnd when only emptiness answers me, my soul shudders. \n\nUPDATE\n\nNext time I woke, it\u2019s because the elevator has jerked to a stop. We are in darkness again and it takes me a moment to get a sense of anything. \n\nI nudge Phil to wake up alongside me and then hear a voice. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s unconscious. I used the last of whatever you used on me.\u201d \n\nI look toward the door which is still open and see the silhouette of Chlo\u00e9. She is looking outward toward the abyss, and holding something next to her body. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t take me long to realize she has taken one of the blocks of c2 from the briefcase. \n\n\u201cChlo\u00e9\u2026 What are you doing? Get away from there,\u201d I said as I tried to stand. \n\n\u201cI heard that thing below us. It\u2019s managed to catch up to us Eli. Can you believe that? No matter how far we\u2019ve risen, that damn monster is on our tails\u2026\u201d she said. \n\nHer voice is hardly coherent. I know she is not thinking clearly and it paralyzes me with terror. \n\n\u201cWhatever you\u2019re thinking of doing\u2026 you can\u2019t do it. If you let that stuff explode, it could kill all of us,\u201d I told her. \n\nShe smiles and I see her face is stained with tears. \n\n\u201cThere is nothing left for me in the world above. This thing, whatever it is, has taken everything from me that matters,\u201d she said. \n\nI know she means that she has forgotten more memories, and the idea that this could happen to me or Phil next is a dreadful one. \n\n\u201cEven if you let the bomb go off we have no way of knowing if that will kill the damn thing. It\u2019s beyond our understanding!\u201d I argued. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get closer,\u201d she warns. The beast roars below and I realize it\u2019s almost here. \n\n\u201cI have made my decision. I know this is the only way I will see the ones I care about again,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 whispers. \n\nShe looks over the edge and her eyes widen. \n\n\u201cOh my god\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 I see it Eli\u2026. No god made this\u2026 this\u2026 thing\u2026\u201d \n\nI try to reach for her. \n\nAnd then she steps into the void.\n\n[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13oxwkf/im_trapped_in_a_basement_elevator_alongside_a/?)",

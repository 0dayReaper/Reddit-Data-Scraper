It has just the right rhythm for me to ignore, but once I\u2019m truly settled in for sleep- something I can\u2019t quite get out of my head.\n\nSquelch. Pop. Tap.\n\nThe rhythm is off. It jolts me back awake, and in my sleep deprived mind I wonder if whatever is tucked inside the box will finally reveal itself and devour me. I wonder why it came to me.\n\nSquelch. Pop. Tap. I can\u2019t get rid of the folded, weak cardboard. It always comes back. Every single time.\n\nThis has been my life for the past two months. And it has been complete, and utter hell.\n\nI won\u2019t blame myself for this. Perhaps it\u2019s the universe telling me my ways are the ways of evil. I\u2019m not entirely a good person.I\u2019m a fence. I\u2019m a middleman for crime- I buy up goods I know aren\u2019t procured legally and sell them at a higher price. I make a pretty hefty profit from it all- I\u2019ve fenced all sorts of things- high brow art, elitist watches- even encountered a few cursed artifacts in my time.\n\nThere was a clock that would always freeze, break, and assemble itself by morning. The shrunken head of a serial killer that supposedly, would rise by night to kill (thank the Whale for protective enchantments).\n\nBut the box was something else.It had been a cool spring morning when I first heard about the box. \u201cYo!\u201d my friend- perhaps business associate Canopy texted. \u201cWe\u2019ve got something people will be quite interested in.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d I texted back. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\nHe sent a photo of the large cardboard box. \u201cCan\u2019t tell you what\u2019s in it. My buyer wants to use a middle man- I\u2019ll sell it to you for let\u2019s say, three hundred, he\u2019ll buy it from you for a thousand.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d I wondered if he was lying. Canopy was shady- I was never exactly sure who he was working for. But his deals, especially ones for cursed material paid well.\n\nBut this one seemed too good to be true- and for a second, I wondered if this was a setup, and he was working for the Company- the slightly less moral equivalent to police in the black market for cursed materials.\n\n\u201cYeah!\u201d he texted. The forced exclamation mark seemed creepy. \u201cI\u2019ll have one of my people drop it off.\u201d With that, his icon disappeared into a gray bubble.\n\nI was going to be rich. Slightly richer than usual- a seven hundred dollar profit for a box with material I wasn\u2019t sure what was inside.\n\nI pondered sometimes, on the type of people who wanted to buy cursed artifacts. But then again, most of my clients were rich, and the rich had bad taste. The other half of clients were more middle men looking to buy it into stock.\n\nThe box arrived three days later, in the dead of night.The noises woke me up, really. They permeated my sleeping mind, and I found myself awake- but yet when I woke the noises were gone. There was a doorbell then, and I scrambled for the door.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d I called. I picked him the box, eerily light. Nobody was to be seen, and so I returned inside and set the box on the floor.It began the following night.\n\nAs I laid in bed, almost asleep I heard it. Squelch. Pop. Tap.\n\nI feared someone or something had invaded my house, and I woke. I checked my phone to see if any alarms had been tripped- and yet, none. I gingerly walked out my roo.\n\nSquelch. Pop. Tap. It was coming from my living room.\n\nI found my emergency knife and raised it in front of me. Slowly, I made the journey that seemed oh too far away, carefully entering the room.\n\nSquelch. Pop. Tap. It was coming from deep inside the box. I kneeled down to open it, but stopped as I read thick marker scrawl: \u201cDO NOT OPEN\u201d So I didn\u2019t.\n\nI respected my clients, and it wasn\u2019t exactly hurting me in any way. So I found myself chewing on a melatonin gummy and falling asleep anyway. This routine continued for the better part of a month.\n\nThe following month I was getting worried about the box. Canopy had completely vanished, and had not responded to my many texts of, \u201cWho\u2019s the buyer?\u201d and  \u201cwhen are they coming to pick it up?\u201d.\n\nI was really concerned now. I didn\u2019t like having odd objects in my house, and was frantically looking to sell it to other people.\n\nThe night I found a buyer- Quentin Lorreno, I believe, the noises got\u2026 worse.\n\nI had taken my melatonin and was abut to sleep when I heard it. SQUELCH. POP. TAP. It was louder than it had ever been, and I shot awake, disconcerted. SQUELCH POP TAP. It repeated, quicker.\n\nAnd then it accelerated, growing louder by the second. SQUELCH-POP-TAP SQUELCH-POP-TAP-\n\nI put ear muffs on. The noises permeated them, somehow.\n\nI practically growled, made my way over and was about to shove it away when the noises stopped. They didn\u2019t continue until an hour later, when I was fast asleep, waking me up.\n\nThey were quieter then, but loud enough to keep me up for the better part of the night.My buyer came for it the next day. \u201cSo, what\u2019s inside?\u201d the man asked, a woman beside him.\n\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d I answered. \u201cI paid three hundred for it, but I was told it would sell for a thousand.\u201dThe man nodded to the woman, who reached out and touched it. Her eyes went blank for a second, and then she nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s weird alright. Something mildly powerful. Dangerous enough.\u201d\n\nThey whispered, and then the man spoke. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it for five hundred.\u201dI didn\u2019t like the offer, but I really didn\u2019t like the box. \u201cIt\u2019ll do.\u201d\n\nThe box came back the following week.I was asleep when it woke me again. SQUELCH. POP. TAP. I shot awake, grabbed my knife and stumbled around my house, terrified. I searched around for the loud noise, and finally found it- under my bed.\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d I snapped, shocked.I immediately stuffed it into the living room, in the center of a quick salt circle. I then proceeded to text the clients I\u2019d sold it to.\n\nThey claimed I hadn\u2019t ever sold them anything. They didn\u2019t know anything about a box. SQUELCH. POP. TAP.I couldn\u2019t sleep that night. But when day broke the sounds stopped, and I finally rested.But I couldn\u2019t keep living like that. I couldn\u2019t be taking days off from work- my normal place of work as a court clerk. This was how I started as a fence, seeking out the criminals on trial and getting connections.\n\nEventually I came to a rather risky decision: I would open the box.This came on a sunday morning. \n\nIn my defense I was extremely tired and not thinking well, and the noises had permeated into the early hours of the morning.\u201cI hate you,\u201d I hissed, finding the nearest knife I could and tearing at it. I cut through the permanent marker and opened it- revealing-\n\nThere was nothing inside the box. And when I mean nothing- I mean nothing.\n\nNo cursed sigils. No enchanted words. Nothing to prove there had been anything in the box to begin with. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just crazy,\u201d I murmured, fear pooling in my center.\n\nI tossed the box out into the garbage bin. I followed the garbage truck and watched it be filed away into a landfill. Big mistake.\n\nSQUELCH. POP. TAP. and then something new. PLOP.I practically screamed as I woke from a state of half-sleep. The noise was coming from my living room once again. I peered through my bedroom door- the box was back, sealed and shut, atop my little coffee table.But something had changed. SQUELCH-POP-TAP-PLOP.\n\nAnd then it began to shake, just a little. And the folds began to move, something from underneath poking outwards. And then the opening folded up and I saw ash-dirtied fingers poked out.And then a face in the darkness, only lit by moonlight.\n\nIt was blackened by ash. Dirty, cutup and squirming in the night. Two eyes stared directly at me, yellow and glowing in the night.\n\nThe demon\u2019s mouth started to shake. SQUELCH. POP. TAP.I closed the door and hoped it wouldn\u2019t come for me.\n\nI heard movement. The box tumbling over, cracking as something stepped out. SQUELCH. POP. TAP. It was coming closer and closer, crackling footsteps and then-The sound was outside my bedroom now. SQUELCHPOPTAPPLOP.\n\n It knocked. It turned the handle and I locked the door.\n\nIt scratched and scratched. And SQUELCHPOPTAP.\n\nThis continued until the early dawn. When I finally found the courage to open the door I found a set of prints on the wood- now cracked and dirtied. Ash grey dust printed by four toed talons.\n\nThe box was still open, and nothing lay inside. And then I saw dirtied near-human fingers in front of me, peeking out from the sofa.\n\nI screamed as the thing raised its head, an unnatural smile. SQUELCH POP TAP. I backed away, terror gripping me as it charged forward, arms out, lips in a twisted smile and-It disappeared into the box. I looked again- there was nothing.\n\nNothing I have tried has worked. I followed it back to the garbage pile. I set it on fire. I even called a local priest to bless my home. Nothing has worked. Every solution- the thing returns, smiling, noisy, and more confident.\n\nIt\u2019s started to come into my room at night.I\u2019ll wake up to the sound and see those dirtied fingers at the edge of my bed. And then it\u2019ll prop itself up and smile.\n\nYesterday it got more confident. See, it would merely smile, and watch. But no, now it\u2019s moved on- it\u2019s brought the box into the room.\n\nYesterday it climbed onto the bed and on my chest. I scratched me, once, making those sick noises with its cursed mouth. SQUELCH POP TAP. It struck me across the face- I tried to fight but it was strong.\n\nI need to get rid of this thing. I never should have opened it. Canopy hasn\u2019t responded- nobody believes me- anyone I sell it to don\u2019t remember buying it.\n\nSQUELCH POP TAP.\n\nOh god. It\u2019s started again. I think this may very well be the death of me. Don\u2019t try to find me. Don\u2019t take the box. Never open it.\n\nGoodbye.",

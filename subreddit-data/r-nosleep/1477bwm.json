    "postText": "\nI (26 F) and my husband (35 M) just moved into small suburban town in rural , Washington. It was nice there in the house we purchased was quite large for the family size we had with just having one child a daughter (5), and a dog. We lived near park where my daughter and dog liked to play. Ok now the actual story. Our neighbor was crazy. She frequently stole things from us when we weren\u2019t looking such as our books flowers in our garden and even at one point our porch swing. \n\n\nWith everything missing f and not knowing the she was the one stealing everything I decided to buy one of the door bells with a camera to track what was happening. Aswell, I asked other neighbors if this happens to them and the same responses happened. \u201cYes things go missing all the time\u201d \u201cthings just vanish\u201c. So with this new door bell I was able to not only see my frost porch, but other lawns so I could help others out too. Now on this day I remember it being very very rainy at the point where the sky was pitch black. \n\n\nMy daughter loved to jump in the puddles so when she asked to go outside I said yes to her, making sure I watched the door bell incase she needed to go inside. This is when it happened. My neighbor, now dressed in a large black rain coat and black winter hat ran up from behind my child and took her inside of her house. It happens in a matter of seconds. I didn\u2019t even realize what had happened because I was talking to my husband sitting in the couch. \n\n\nWhen I called her inside I got no response. I was confused. What had just happened to her. I sent out into the rain and saw her no where. I screamed and called 911. She was filled as missing two days later. I was deep in regret not able to help my only child. I rember scrolling on my phone and saw the doorbell app. Wait, I thought I can see exactly what happened on this. I opened the app and scolded to two days prior. There it was, my neighbor snatching my child right infornt of me. I called the police again and they right to my face told me \u201cit\u2019s not enough proof to arrest and we can\u2019t go in cause we don\u2019t have a warrant\u201d my husband was furious. I only the other hand Inraged with the fact this lady stole my child decided I was going to do somthing about it. \n\nI walked over to the neighbors house and knocked on the door. The lady did come eventually and she asked me. What are you doing here? I told her I know you have my child I know you stole those things for me. Give her back now and I won\u2019t tell anyone else she profusely .said that I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. That\u2019s when I heard the screams of my child.. I push the lady aside. I ran to the back of the house where she was with food all over her mouth and clutter just all over her place. I said come here sweetheart we\u2019re going home and that\u2019s why I turned around to see the lady. (This story is gonna get violent for here to the end). \n\nThe lady was standing there with a knife in her hand. Because we are in a ice neighborhood this house was very large. I dropped my child and told her go run home to dad tell him I\u2019m here tell him to call the police. She went off running. But the lady only stared at my. She smiled but it turned creepy. \u201cI\u2019ve taken an item out of my collection\u201d she said to me \u201cI will punish you for that\u201d and she hurled at me with the knife. I dodged her and made my way through the clutter and mess the house was made of and got to the door when the lady came back. \u201cUr not getting away this time\u201d she slashed at me with the knife. It cut open my arm and blood started to rush. \n\nMy screams distracted her and I punched her in the thought. I scrimmaged through the massive piles of junk when I found a shard of glass. I picked it up and put it behind my back. The lady was walking to me again. Saying the same things that she was prior. I fake cried knowing I was about to get the upper hand on her. She started to taunt me with the knife and that\u2019s when I stuck her. It went right into her neck. I took the shard out. The lady started to gurgle as blood sprayed everywhere. Then out of luck. She stabbed me in the gut. I froze. The pain ruptured through my body. I looked down and took the knife out. \n\nScreaming I took the knife and glass shard and plugged them into the lady. I blacked out. I woke up in the hospital a few days later. The doctors told me that I had died for over 3 minutes!. I was bewildered and confused. My family came in later and I got the story about the Andy and who she was. She was mentally unstable for years and no body said anything about it. A-swell my daughter spoke out about what happened to her there but I wound be speaking about it for her privacy. I am alright now and luckily moved out of state and stated a fresh  life putting this all behind me.",

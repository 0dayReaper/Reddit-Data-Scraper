    "postText": "[Of course I wasn\u2019t going to meet G in the park at midnight.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/145pzej/23andme_says_i_have_a_second_mother/) That sounded like a good way to get murdered. \u201cBut I *am* really curious,\u201d I said to my husband Danny. \u201cDo you think she\u2019s my mom\u2019s sister, or twin, or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the bigger question is how she knew where we live,\u201d he replied, shaking his head. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand why you won\u2019t file a police report.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can file a police report for someone sticking something in your mailbox.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not *just* that. She messaged you creepy stuff on 23andme, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust that one message.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. See? That *with* the letter could be enough for a police report.\u201d Danny sat down at the table, facing me. \u201cIt\u2019s freaking weird, Kayla. We should call someone.\u201d\n\nI bit my lip. He was right. But say G was some weird stalker, or something. She wouldn\u2019t be able to falsify her DNA records to match mine. It was more likely that she was a long-lost relative, who decided to find me after our brief messaging on 23andme. Unfortunately, my last name is pretty unique. And I\u2019d given it to her right in the message I sent her. All she had to do was search for Kayla T---, filtering by northwestern states in the US, and she would find my address.\n\n\u201cPeople were saying online that if Mom had an identical twin, she\u2019d show up as my mother, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you said her ancestry wasn\u2019t the same as your mom\u2019s, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not. But apparently 2% Scandinavian ancestry is such a small amount, it could just be an error.\u201d I looked at my phone and sighed. My mom still hadn\u2019t called me back. I\u2019d told her I wanted to talk about G\u2026 which, in retrospect, was probably a mistake.\n\nWell, there was nothing to do now but wait for her call.\n\nWe went to bed at 10, but I couldn\u2019t sleep. My mom hadn\u2019t called me back all day, which was really uncharacteristic for her. The dread in the pit of my stomach grew. *Mom\u2019s lied to me my entire life. She has a sister. An identical twin.*\n\n*Why didn\u2019t she tell me?*\n\n*And where has G been all these years? Did my grandparents give her up for adoption, when they were young? Did she run away and grow up in a foster home?*\n\nThe entire thing was making my head spin.\n\nI must\u2019ve drifted off at some point, because the next thing I knew, I woke with a start. I stared into the darkness, unsure what had woken me. But then I heard it.\n\n*Thump, thump, thump.*\n\nSomeone was knocking on the door.\n\nMy heart plummeted. I glanced over at Danny\u2014but he was fast asleep. The clock read 1:11 AM. Swallowing, I pulled myself out of bed.\n\n*It has to be G.*\n\n*I\u2019m not going to open the door. I\u2019m just going to look out the window.*\n\nThe only window that overlooked the front porch was the one in the guest bedroom. Slowly, I tiptoed across the hallway, careful to not make any noise that could be heard from outside. I crouched in front of the window, and with a deep breath, swung the blinds away.\n\nI couldn\u2019t see that much of her. The porch roof obscured her top half. But I could make out a plain black skirt, trailing to the floor. And, beneath that\u2026\n\nBare feet.\n\nBare feet caked with dirt and mud. I glanced to the driveway, to the street\u2014but didn\u2019t see any cars, other than our own and the neighbors\u2019. *Did she walk here? In bare feet? From the park? Four miles away?*\n\n*Thump! Thump! Thump!*\n\nMore knocking. Louder. Quicker. Insistent.\n\nI crouched there, my legs aching, holding my breath. Something about this felt very, *very* wrong. Instinctively my shaking hands found my stomach. Thinking of my little baby.\n\n*THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!*\n\nI finally pushed myself into action. I ran across the hallway and woke Danny. While he was slowly getting up, I grabbed my phone and dialed the police. After they assured me someone was on the way, I walked back to the guest bedroom and pulled the blinds back.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t on the porch anymore.\n\nFor one wonderful, relief-inducing second, I thought she\u2019d left. That she\u2019d given up on me and decided to walk home.\n\nBut then I saw her.\n\nShe was standing in the darkness of our front yard.\n\nAnd she was looking straight up into my window.\n\nMaybe I should\u2019ve run. Maybe I should\u2019ve hidden in the bedroom with Danny until the police came. But something came over me. Maybe my first wave of maternal instinct. That I had to protect my baby at all costs.\n\nI yanked the window open. \u201cHey!\u201d I shouted. \u201cGet the *fuck* off my property! I called the police!\u201d\n\nNow that my eyes had adjusted to the darkness, I could see her better. I could see her face. She looked *nothing* like my mother.\n\n\u201cHEY!\u201d I screamed, my voice cracking. \u201cDid you hear me?! The police will be here any second!\u201d\n\nShe stared at me.\n\nThen she slowly stepped towards the house. She didn\u2019t stop until she was right underneath my window. She tilted her face up to look at me, her head at almost a ninety-degree angle with her body.\n\nThen she smiled.\n\n\u201cThe police may be able to chase me away,\u201d she whispered, so quietly I could barely hear it over the wind. \u201cBut they won\u2019t be able to save your baby.\u201d\n\nThen she turned on her bare heel and walked away.\n\nI watched her disappear into the darkness, my entire body shaking. Danny joined me a few seconds later, and he wrapped his arms around me, telling me everything would be okay. But I couldn\u2019t shake off the feeling that something horrible was going to happen.\n\n*They won\u2019t be able to save your baby.*\n\nThe police took our statement. They weren\u2019t able to find the woman, but assured us they\u2019d keep looking. Since she visited, I haven\u2019t been able to focus. Haven\u2019t been able to sleep. Because of my fears about my baby\u2026\n\nAnd because of something else.\n\nAs I watched her walk away that night, I noticed she had a birthmark just above her right elbow.\n\nJust like I [have](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels).\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/148xxk8/23andme_says_i_have_a_second_mother_part_3_final/)",

Like, you wake him up because G, this batshit crazy woman, is banging on your door at an obscene hour and you've got enough time to call the cops, gather your courage, scream at the woman, have her walk to beneath your window, threaten your unborn baby, and leave before Danny meanders into the room without any sort of weapon or anything but a hug. That would personally make me want to re-evaluate my marriage because if G was a snake, you and your unborn baby would be dead before Danny even got out of bed. \n\nLike, I'm glad that nothing bad happened, but Danny needs to get his head out of his ass.",

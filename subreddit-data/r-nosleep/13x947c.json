Stephanie came home early, while It was still caressing my thigh. The sudden entrance startled It, and its long claw sliced my skin. I hid it from her, and when I woke up the next day, those scars from the claws was still there. I haven\u2019t been dreaming. I was never dreaming.*\n\n*It was right under our nose this whole time.*\n\n*I\u2019ll strike when It least expects it.*\n\n*I will have my revenge.*\n\n*I know what it is now.*\n\n*I know where it is.*\n\n*I shudder to think I\u2019ve walked over that fucking crawlspace every time I went into that damn laundry room.\u201d*\n\nOh, how things click into place when they\u2019re shown to you.\n\nThe invisible suddenly exposing itself to flash you, akin to a perfectly executed \u201cfuck you\u201d for not paying attention before.\n\nIn the days leading up to her death, Angie had always been hesitant to go into the laundry room, and now I was sure I knew why.\n\nI searched for it after I picked Jasper up from the Vet.\n\nThe crack in question was nearly imperceptible unless you were down on your knees and aiming your gaze right at it.\n\nAfter using Angie\u2019s knife to crack it open, I was hit by the air that board kept down on a daily basis.\n\nA rotten scent which smelled like a mixture of animal food and the breath of someone who never brushed.\n\nAn oversized blanket lay there, coiled like a bird\u2019s nest as though it had been stirred with a spoon. Empty food wrappers lay as far as the eye could see, but what caught my attention the most was the small, black notebook in the central eye of the blanket.\n\nI haphazardly picked it up, almost falling down in the process.\n\nI flipped this notebook to a random entry and started to read.\n\n*\u201cI wonder why she doesn\u2019t notice me\u2026*\n\n*She should\u2019ve realized I\u2019m here by now.*\n\n*I guess I\u2019ve given her brains too much credit.*\n\n*Still, it\u2019s nice watching them shower.*\n\n*It does get boring rather quickly when they don\u2019t notice you.*\n\n*I wonder what they\u2019re reactions would be like if they knew.*\n\n*Especially that one. But I think the other is catching on quickly. Oh how I can\u2019t wait to play with her.\u201d*\n\nThe rest of the pages all contained the same ramblings you read above, but phrased differently just enough to make you think they were all different.\n\nBut they were all the same.\n\nThe plain never-ending words of a lunatic.\n\nWhere the person who\u2019d written them was at that point was anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t feel safe anymore.\n\nWith no warning, I heard a noise from behind me and jumped, nearly spitting my heart out. But then I saw Jasper standing stoically by the doorway.\n\nI sighed in relief and walked past him.\n\nI was determined to get that wretched notebook to the police, and I was about to leave, but the front door wouldn\u2019t open.\n\nI jiggled the knob but to no avail.\n\nI wonder why my mind didn\u2019t register the red flag waving right in front of my eyes.\n\nAll I\u2019m sure of is that I only stopped when a voice talked to me from behind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite futile, I assure you,\u201d they said.\n\nI froze in place.\n\nI froze not because I was startled by the voice, but because I recognized it.\n\nArthur.\n\nMy feet were the only thing of mine which could move, and I turned around, expecting to see him.\n\nBut Arthur was nowhere to be found.\n\nI only saw Jasper.\n\nI looked around frantically, trying to find him, when his voice rang out again.\n\n\u201cReally,\u201d Arthur said,\u201d is it really that hard to look down?\u201d\n\nJasper swung his tail slowly, like the pendulum of a clock, and had I not seen the next words come out of his mouth, I never would have believed what my mind was screaming at me in that very moment.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d my cat said,\u201d there we go.\u201d\n\nJasper was talking in Arthur\u2019s voice, and I felt my bones melt.\n\nAt the drop of a hat, I went from a rigid statue to a gelatinous sculpture struggling to keep its shape on the floor.\n\nJasper\u2019s\u2026or rather Arthur\u2019s slit pupils were dilated, like two gashes stretched open by forceps. Predatory bloodlust oozed out uncontrollably from them.\n\nI thought of all the times I\u2019d held him in my arms, cuddled him, and changed in front of him, but the wave of disgust that I felt in me was unceremoniously eclipsed by the pain of the glass rod I hadn\u2019t been aware of exploding, its shattered fragments penetrating every single part of me that my skin would hold at bay at any given time.\n\nThe pain my mind and body were feeling at that moment is indescribable.\n\nMy muscles felt constricted by needles while my brain felt like it would be shredded by the shards it was eating from my bloodstream.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if I had a stroke or an aneurism.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t.\n\nArthur just purred at the sight.\n\n\u201cYou know my love, it really could have been just us. Every decade or so I would come back as a different cat, and I would give you all the hugs and cuddles and kisses you could possibly imagine, but that bitch just HAD to interfere. It really is quite sad. Her skin was so smooth, so easy to cut and bruise at the slightest of touch. I daresay she\u2019s better than you in that aspect, but oh how much you have that she never could. A venerable forbidden fruit you are, out of the reach of man. I find that to be very unfair.\u201d\n\n\u201cT-The FUCK  ARE YOU?!\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen them, haven\u2019t we?\n\nThose horror movies where we laugh at the sight of a character asking the obvious or making a stupid decision.\n\nWell, you have to be there to feel it.\n\nIt\u2019s not the fear that gets to you.\n\nIt\u2019s the confusion.\n\nThat\u2019s what you feel.\n\nWhat you see in those movies, and what I was experiencing at that moment, was a delicate combination of the two that prevented me from going into full fight or flight.\n\nI was just frozen in place, my mind struggling to wrap itself around this absurd situation.\n\nAnd Arthur knew this full well.\n\n\u201cCome on love,\u201d he told me, his whiskers twitching like the legs of a cricket,\u201d you know oh so well what I am. I\u2019m your one and only love. The only one who will be there for you, you\u2019ll allow into your bed, you\u2019ll cook for, and so on. What\u2019s so hard to understand about that?\u201d\n\n\u201cB-but you\u2019re a fucking CAT!\u201d\n\nMy words were like the sputters of an engine, and the whole while I was talking, I kept thinking about a way out. I knew that he\u2019d most likely locked all the other doors somehow, and I couldn\u2019t risk jumping out of a window. I had my car keys with me, but now the only problem was getting out.\n\n\u201cA small price to pay,\u201d he replied with a purr that made my skin crawl.\n\nAt that moment, I didn\u2019t have the slightest idea why I was afraid of such a small cat. But I guess at some level I probably understood that he\u2019d been the one who\u2019d killed Vic and Angie, so I really couldn\u2019t take any chances.\n\nThe words that Angie had written in her dream journal also wrecked chaos in my mind.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Arthur said while coming near me, \u201cWe can make it work. True love always finds a way after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cTHIS ISN\u2019T TRUE LOVE YOU SON OF A BITCH! YOU KILLED MY TRUE LOVE LIKE THE JEALOUS FUCKING PRICK YOU ARE AND THAT YOU\u2019LL ALWAYS BEEN! A PATHETIC SWINE DRESSED LIKE A CAT YOU ARE! JUST LIKE ALL THE FUCKING REST!\u201d\n\nAt that, he stopped, and I\u2019ll never forget how those sharp pupils seemed to slice me into pieces with their gaze.\n\nIt hit me that if I didn\u2019t move in a bit, now that he was distracted, I\u2019d never have a better chance of making it out alive.\n\nBut the cascade of cracks that began to ring out made me hesitate. I saw the cat writhe on the floor as it seemed to gurgle and its skin boil, as his tail got longer and his claws got sharper.\n\nI ran up the stairs, hoping that I could find an opened window and make my way to the car. The keys were still in my pocket, but I feared my wits were on the verge of abandoning me.\n\nI went to the bedroom and slammed the door behind me before locking it. I then tried to desperately open that damn window, but to my absolute dismay, I saw that it had been glued shut, and my wits really did leave me when I saw a caulk tube of silicone on the floor.\n\nBut then I remembered the knife.\n\nAfter nearly slicing my fingers off, I positioned the tip of the blade at the center of the window, but just as I prepared my hand for a grand push that was more like a blow, I heard something which made me stop dead in my tracks.\n\nA knock.\n\nIt felt like my circulatory system had solidified, my blood frozen like ice.\n\nThe knock had been rather quiet, but I heard it nonetheless.\n\nIt came twice more before an emulsifying silence followed.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when it came.\n\nA hand.\n\nA hand much like a tarantula \u2013 with long and sharp claws instead of long and hairy legs \u2013 crawled from under the crevice of the door before it crept up and up and up towards the handle like a true spider taking its time.\n\nA click echoed, and I found myself faced with what Angie had to bear seeing every day before it finally killed her.\n\nThe door opened to reveal a gaunt figure covered in patches of fur resembling a fir tree, with a tail more like a spine dragging behind it. Its limbs were so long they almost reached the ground, capped by feet and hands with long daggers for claws.\n\nBut the face is the one I\u2019ll never forget.\n\nDon\u2019t imagine a cat.\n\nImagine a rabbit instead.\n\nDon\u2019t imagine a cute rabbit.\n\nImagine one that is feral and angry, one injected with bile of absolute loathing, diseased to the point where having rabies is considered a healthy state of being.\n\nBeady eyes like bullets which are like caterpillars trying to wiggle through a crevice, with teeth so small and so numerous so as to appear like a saw.\n\nEars small enough to be on the head of a normal cat and a\u2026 a-a penis which looked like the skinned tail of an elephant.\n\nThere are few moments in modern life where you feel danger as primal as that, and I can say with certainty that I will never again in my life be able to turn faster than I did at that very moment.\n\nBut even so, those spindly daggers still managed to wrap themselves around my leg before anything shattered.\n\nI dropped the knife, and felt myself get dragged away from what I saw as my only escape.\n\nFurther and further away I was pulled along the floor like a pathetic mop.\n\nI was being dragged into the mist, everything becoming hazy.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before I smelled the crawlspace again.\n\nThis disgusting smell, even worse than before, like a urine-soaked sponge that had fermented in the sun for weeks.\n\nI felt myself pinned down against the blanket, my wrists scored like you do with a large chunk of meat.\n\nI was trapped.\n\nI felt lost.\n\nThe breath that hit my face made me want to puke.\n\nIt made my skin shrivel like burned hair and my eyes tear.\n\nI do remember being glad.\n\nStrange, right?\n\nI was glad, in a sense, that it had been me and not Angie, who would suffer the worst.\n\nI was damn close to resigning myself to the fate I knew awaited me.\n\nI was blind and helpless after all, made to feel even more so by the deranged and twisted smile \u2013 just like a lipless gash \u2013 that I could barely look at.\n\nBut then there was a light.\n\nA blinding light of hope.\n\nArthur had momentarily released his grip on my left arm to reposition his penis, and in that moment, as my arm went limp, I felt something, and a reflex of sorts \u2013 at least something faster than thought \u2013 took over and it all happened in a flash.\n\nBefore he could process what had happened, I\u2019d already stabbed him with Angie\u2019s butterfly knife.\n\nI\u2019d had it this whole time, but we\u2019d been too focused on each other\u2019s faces for either of us to notice.\n\nArthur let out an odd sort of sound as I felt the skin of my hand become doused in hot, pulsating red blood.\n\nIt felt like putting your hand in a used latrine.\n\nThe sensation of his coarse fur rubbing against my sensitive skin was akin to an artist violating his canvas.\n\nI half expected his claws to stab into me, or at the very least him trying to choke me, or even look at me.\n\nBut my monster did none of those.\n\nInstead, he started to whimper like a sad puppy and whither like a flag guided by a gentle breeze.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before I started to feel his weight as the strings of his soul loosened their hold on him one by one.\n\nAnd one by one I also heard crack after crack, though from where I had no idea.\n\nHe didn\u2019t stop moving until the end, getting smaller and smaller.\n\nThe light of the washroom fell on me as I found myself cradling my dead cat in its nest, soaked in gallons of blood that hadn\u2019t been its own.\n\nArthur really was gone.\n\nAnd so too was the glass rod I had been carrying in me since that dinner.\n\nFool me once, shame on you.\n\nFool me twice, shame on me.\n\nFool me thrice\u2026shame on both of us.\n\nDon\u2019t you agree, Arthur?\n\n\u2026\n\nI just laid there.\n\nThe sheets around me had soaked every ounce of blood, and made me feel like I was swimming in a pool of it.\n\nI was held afloat by the hollowness I felt at that moment, not even registering the pain.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how long I lay there.\n\nI waited for my cat to twitch or move, but it never did.\n\nJasper was still, and I found myself thinking if I\u2019d ever pet him.\n\nHad I always been caressing Arthur, or had there been moments when Jasper had felt my touch? Had Arthur come to me that night, or had it been Jasper?\n\nI thought and I thought, and I thought for so long that, by the time I stopped thinking, the blood around me had completely dried up.\n\nI got up and left the washroom, my skin cracking as I moved about, like I was a snake about to shed it.\n\nI showered for as long as I could, until the hot water went cold, and even then, I didn\u2019t stop showering. I sat and stood in the tub until my hand moved on its own and turned the water off.\n\nI put on some fresh clothes, and I left, not even bothering to get my car keys.\n\nI only left that house with the clothes I had, my wallet, and Angie\u2019s butterfly knife.\n\nI\u2019d also made sure to pour a can of gasoline on top of Jasper in the washroom.\n\nA single lit match was all it took to kickstart my former cat\u2019s christening, and I never looked back as a countless cascade of flames burst forth like hands from a mass grave.\n\nI found myself wandering through the empty streets of the nearby town, having not looked back once.\n\nBefore I knew it, I found myself clutching a bottle of wine.\n\nThere came a point where there really was no one but myself, and the only thing left for me to do was to sit down on the curb and stare up at the sky.\n\nI did think about ending it with Angie\u2019s knife.\n\nI\u2019d join her, and the storm drain between my legs would make sure no blood would be left.\n\nMy resolve regarding this was quite powerful, I\u2019ll admit, but for a reason I\u2019ll never know, I decided to do this only after finishing my bottle of wine.\n\nMaybe I was scared to cut myself and wanted to go by alcohol poisoning.\n\nMaybe I wanted to numb the pain I knew I was going to experience.\n\nMaybe it was divine intervention.\n\nMaybe I\u2019ll never know, and I\u2019m fine with that.\n\nAll I know is that the moment the last drop of that wine entered through my lips and slid down my throat, a voice I hadn\u2019t been expecting called out to me.\n\n\u201cH-hey there,\u201d they said, and I knew they were drunk before I even turned around.\n\nA tall man with disheveled and sandy blonde hair, wearing a formal but unbuttoned suit, stood before me, himself tightly clutching a bottle of alcohol (vodka, in case you were wondering).\n\nHe was nowhere near done with it, but to say he was hammered was a definite understatement.\n\nThe man \u2013 who introduced himself as Max \u2013 sat down next to me, and I didn\u2019t have the state of mind to protest.\n\nAfter some small talk, he asked me how I ended up like him.\n\n\u201cDid your dog also find your boyfriend\u2019s lover in the fucking closet?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2026,\u201d I replied, \u201cLet\u2019s just say my cat made my girlfriend\u2019s life a living hell. Mine too.\u201d\n\nMax eyed the scars on my legs as our bottles stood side by side.\n\n\u201cYou gotta tell me the breed,\u201d he said, \u201cI want to send my ex one of those SO fucking badly.\u201d\n\nI laughed for the first time in a long time.\n\nWe had a nice conversation after that.\n\nA kind of conversation I hadn\u2019t had in a long time.\n\nOne which left me relieved by the end.\n\nMax told some funny stories about how close he\u2019d come to finding his ex-cheating before, some awkward mishaps during his middle school band performance, and so on.\n\nI made up a story about how I\u2019d been kicked out of my home by my ex and how she\u2019d given up the cat, to which Max was sympathetic too, and even said that it was probably for the best.\n\nI didn\u2019t agree, but in a way, I was glad that\u2026this was all past me.\n\nThere came the time where we had to depart, but just as I was about to leave, Max asked me if I\u2019d like to crash at his place.\n\nI stared at him, and then I looked behind me, and for the briefest of moments, I saw a plume of smoke in the distance billowing up towards the sky.\n\nI told Max that sounded swell, and when he turned around for me to follow, I dropped Angie\u2019s butterfly knife down the storm drain.\n\nSomething told me it had done its purpose in protecting me, just like she would\u2019ve wanted, and I caught up with Max.\n\nI like to think that the bottles we left behind on the curb were the grave for our respective pasts.\n\nAnd not just us being too lazy to recycle.\n\n\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been a month now.\n\nMe and Max have become wonderful friends, and for the first time in a while, I feel I\u2019m somewhere I belong.\n\nMax should be coming from work right around now.\n\nHis Labrador Retriever, Queenie, is by my side. He really is a wonderful dog, with his soft fur and child-like eyes.\n\nI have thought about the rod.\n\nSometimes at night.\n\nSometimes in the morning.\n\nSometimes at work.\n\nAnd even now.\n\nBut as far as I know, there\u2019s nothing down in there.\n\nMax just came from his late shift.\n\nThe clock has struck midnight\n\nAnd nothing feels out of place.\n\nBut, alas, I know better than to assume that everything will stay in place.",

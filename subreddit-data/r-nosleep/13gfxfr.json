    "postText": "\u201cThey\u2019re coming.\u201d\n\nMy wife whisked Ella out the room, calling to me once more as she left. \u201cYou\u2019ll regain movement in a few minutes, hon. I promise that you\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\n[Then she disappeared from sight](https://redd.it/138k8jv).\n\nI sat there, just as shocked and immobile as that time when Kimmy swore that it happened to every guy, unable to comprehend what had just happened. \n\nBut I knew that my family was counting on me to rise to the occasion, overcoming the greatest of obstacles: those that we erect in our own minds. \n\nI reached deeper than I ever had.\n\nAnd sat there completely useless. Whatever the fuck mystical abilities my wife had, they were powerful. I couldn\u2019t control a single muscle. \n\nAnother fart slipped out. My attempts to control it were impotent. \n\nSo I was forced to think about the situation before me, which is the last thing a person wants to endure when he\u2019s in the thick of things. Every cell in my body screamed at me to get up and chase after my wife and daughter \u2013 but maybe I needed to stop and consider the fact that Kimmy had a reason for forcing me to stay behind. She clearly knew me well enough to predict that I would try to follow them; maybe this was a moment to stop and ponder the reality that I never would have accepted otherwise, to realize that we\u2019re stronger when we let go of the things that we believe are impossible to live without.\n\nThen my leg twitched. Excitement rushed through me as I forgot my train of thought and moved my hands and feet, slowly finding that I could crawl across the room. Within a minute, I was thumping through the hallway, determined to get into my car and follow wherever they had gone. \n\nI was still uncoordinated when I started my car. Not as bad as my friend Bert when he leaves Room 1913 after a night of drinking, swearing that he\u2019s good to drive. \n\nI hate Bert.\n\nAgain, I wasn\u2019t as bad as Bert. \n\nInstinct took me to the 10. Kimmy always said that we should hop on the 10 going east if the Apocalypse ever unfolded, and it made sense to retreat into the empty desert if it meant escaping humanity at its purest. \n\nPart of me knew that I would never find her; she had a head start in driving, planning, and motivation. \n\nBut a bigger part of me decided to ignore the smaller voice in my brain. If you don\u2019t have something for which you\u2019re willing to be ridiculously illogical, then life just isn\u2019t worth living. I would drive until the wheels fell off my blue-green 1999 Toyota Corolla. \n\nThen I saw her car on the side of the road. It looked like she\u2019d pulled over in a moment of extreme duress. I screeched to a halt next to her blinking lights and spotted her silhouette in the darkness. Ripping my keys from the ignition, I stumbled out of the car and raced toward her.\n\nMy blood dropped ten degrees as I realized why she had been forced to stop. An impossibly tall, thin man stood before her, wrapped tightly in a black cloak, his face almost entirely hidden in darkness. He and Kimmy stood facing each other, twenty paces apart, like they were about to duel. My wife clutched our baby daughter in her arms. \n\nInstinct flooded through me as I rushed forward to protect my family. Fear grew as I closed the distance, but the terror of doing nothing was even greater. \u201cGET BACK, KIMMY!\u201d I screamed as I charged the man.\n\nHe pivoted toward me, frozen in shock when I reached him. I aimed low, planning to take his tall and skinny ass down at the knees before working his face with a few punches.\n\nThe man flicked his fingers in surprise.\n\nI\u2019ve been hit by a car just once in my life. It was during a 5k road race, and the idiot driver hadn\u2019t realized the streets were closed before I ran in front of him. He slammed the brakes at the last second, which meant that I had been very hurt instead of very dead.\n\nThe thin man\u2019s hand felt like that car hitting me. I crashed to the ground at Kimmy\u2019s feet, gasping for air.\n\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Russ,\u201d she sighed, reaching down to tap my shoulders. \n\nI instantly went limp again. Which sucked, because I really wanted to curl up into the fetal position and moan about the pain in every part of my body. \n\nIt also sucked because I was terrified of what was about to happen, but couldn\u2019t do a damn thing. I found myself in the unusual dynamic of listening quietly to what my wife said without adding any of my own thoughts. \n\n\u201cYou ran me off the road, Malvern,\u201d she hissed. \u201cYou have my attention. What do you need to say?\u201d\n\nThe thin man cocked his head at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve known the truth since before she was *born*, Kim. We\u2019ll never stop hunting you until we have your daughter. You can live with the inevitable, or you can die with it.\u201d\n\nGod *damn*, did his icy-scratchy voice make my butthole pucker. It sounded like gibbon incisors scraping a frozen chalkboard made of sadness. \n\n\u201cEven if you managed to kill me Kim, they would send another in my place, and another, and another. You have no hope.\u201d \n\nShe clutched Ella tighter before moving to stand protectively over me. \u201cSo that makes you the opening pawn, right?\u201d\n\nI wanted to tell my wife to stop provoking the psychopath in the cape, but I couldn\u2019t talk. No matter how hard I pushed, the only physical sensation I could produce was the feeling of gas moving through my colon. \n\nThe thin man looked pissed and was clearly out for blood.\n\nI think that helplessness is the greatest of all fears, because every terror is rooted in it. Until you\u2019ve prepared yourself to watch your family die while completely paralyzed, you haven\u2019t experienced the level of fear that a human mind can endure. \n\nObviously, I made it out. [But not everyone did](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).\n\n----------\n\n[How I made it out](https://redd.it/13mq968)\n\n----------\n\n[BD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/)\n\n\n\n[W](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcn_pa1QfNMRzbTuJqXSoRQ)\n\n[E](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)",

He said that he was proud of her because she was defending herself.\n\nThat's when he said that we learn about fight or flight but there's another F word that's an option, but you learn that on the streets. \n\nWhich, basically circles back to you in that your natural instinct is neither fight or flight. It's fart.",

    "postText": "It was hard to see the therapist in the dark. The dim overhead light cast deep shadows over his face, barely illuminating the tops of his ears and bridge of a long nose. The rest was lost in darkness, swathed in the deep black of the silent room.\n\n\r  \nI breathed out slowly, trying to focus myself. The session was taking me to difficult questions, making me focus on thoughts I would rather ignore, and it took effort. I felt like I was stumbling barefoot across jagged rocks, knowing that if I didn\u2019t, eventually they would get too sharp to walk on and I\u2019d be stuck on the other side forever.\n\n\r  \n\u2018I said I\u2019d stay until Adrian was 18,\u2019 I sighed, putting my head in my hands again and rubbing at my face, as though I could invigorate some decisiveness into my skin. \u2018But he\u2019s 16 now, and two years just seems like a lifetime. I don\u2019t know if I could take it.\u2019\n\n\r  \n\u2018What is it that scares you about that?\u2019 the therapist asked in his soft, considered voice. So non-judgmental. So understanding. I hated him, and wanted a drink very badly.\n\n\r  \nI leaned back on my chair, resting my head on the cold hard shelf behind me. A bookshelf, I assumed. I couldn\u2019t see it in the dark, but therapists always had bookshelves in movies.\n\n\r  \n\u2018At 16 he\u2019s old enough to understand,\u2019 the doctor continued, \u2018so if you had to leave sooner you wouldn\u2019t be letting him down \u2013 \u2018\n\n\r  \n\u2018That\u2019s not what I meant.\u2019 I said flatly, perhaps rudely, cutting across him. \u2018I mean that if I don\u2019t go, I think I might do something I regret. I\u2019m just so, angry. All the time. Everything she does makes me want to sneer and snarl, and it\u2019s all I can do to restrain myself.\u2019\n\n\r  \n\u2018And how does she feel?\u2019 asked the voice in the darkness. I rubbed at my throbbing temples.\n\n\r  \n\u2018I think she knows. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s been different recently. More waspish, more irritable. She marches around doing household chores like some indignant martyr, even though I do most of them now, since I lost my job, as though making an effort to highlight how much she\u2019s doing for us. For me. And how little I\u2019m doing. Like I\u2019m nothing but a man-child in her way. A bum. An alcoh \u2013\u2018\n\n\r  \nI cut myself off and sat silently in the dark, staring at the approximate spot where my feet should be. A few moments passed, the still air broken only by my slightly elevated breathing.\n\n\r  \n\u2018An alcoholic?\u2019 the velvet voice almost whispered. I nodded, forgetting for a moment that the therapist couldn\u2019t see me any more than I could see him.\n\n\r  \n\u2018Are you sure this anger is really about her?\u2019 the unseen doctor asked, and I felt something within me twinge at the suggestion. Something defensive. Of course it was about her. She was being unreasonable. She was the one making a bad situation worse. The one who \u2013\n\n\r  \nWasn\u2019t having therapy.\n\n\r  \nI gritted my teeth, biting back the sudden resentment I felt towards the therapist. On the heels of that feeling a thought crossed my mind.\n\n\r  \n\u2018Hey, why do you keep it so dark in here anyway?\u2019\n\n\r  \n\u2018You wanted it this way. And these kinds of sessions need to feel\u2026private, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u2019\n\n\r  \nI nodded heavily again, trying to remember if I\u2019d asked for the darkness. Perhaps it was because of the headache. Or the thirst.\n\n\r  \n\u2018How does Carla feel about your drinking?\u2019 Asked the therapist, after a pause.\n\n\r  \nI squinted up at the light, suddenly wishing I had a drink in my hand and hating myself for it. Carla hated it, of course. Hated it and blamed it for what had happened to me. But she had it backwards. I wasn\u2019t a wreck before I lost my job, but I\u2019d been trying to avoid becoming one ever since.\n\n\r  \n\u2018She says she\u2019s being supportive,\u2019 I muttered, not liking the catch in my throat or the feeling of tingling heat behind my eyes. \u2018But every time she looks at me, every time I catch her shaking her head and staring out the window, every time I overhear her on the phone. I just\u2026get worse. And she gets worse. She\u2019s making me this way.\u2019\n\n\r  \nI felt a hot blaze of rage building up inside me, and was grateful to have a replacement for the empty despair that had been filling my stomach before.\n\n\r  \n\u2018Making me into a drunk,\u2019 I growled, and kicked out at the unseen room. My foot connected with something hard and I heard the tinkle of glass bouncing on a hard surface. I paused, confused.\n\n\r  \n\u2018Hey what was that?\u2019 I asked, the hot rage receding and the unhappy thoughts returning. With them came the thirst.\n\n\r  \n\u2018You tell me,\u2019 the therapist replied, \u2018it\u2019s your house.\u2019\n\n\r  \nAt that the mists cleared a bit and I remembered. A house call, of course. The thought seemed to float in front of me for a moment, as though wondering whether I would accept it or not. I wanted to, felt myself leaning toward it, only for it to flit away on insubstantial wings. Something wasn\u2019t quite right.\n\n\r  \n\u2018Do you often do house calls?\u2019 I asked, blinking at the dim light and trying to think my way through my muddled thoughts.\n\n\r  \n\u2018Very often,\u2019 the soft voice replied. \u2018I\u2019m always available.\u2019\n\n\r  \n\u2018Even on Christmas,\u2019 it added, with a single mirthless chuckle.\n\n\r  \n\u2018Tell me more about the relationship now,\u2019 the therapist said from the chair in the deep shadows. \u2018Tell me about this week.\u2019\n\n\r  \nIn my mind I saw Carla\u2019s face, hard and unsmiling. Looking at me in that awful way, like she didn\u2019t even know me anymore, and wouldn\u2019t care to if she met me now for the first time. I felt the guilt, the failure, the anguish that arose in me at the sight of that face, and the cleansing anger that followed behind. The terrible rage that burned away those gut-wrenching feelings and replaced them with a light and heat that gave me structure, gave me dignity. Let me feel like I was the one wronged, like I was justified.\n\n\r  \n\u2018This week was the last straw,\u2019 I said bitterly, realising as I said it that it was true. I\u2019d made my mind up after all, it seemed.\n\n\r  \n\u2018I went to the job centre. This was on Monday. Got up early, really early, and took care not to wake her. I wanted to show her I could be responsible like I was before.\u2019\n\n\r  \n\u2018Admirable,\u2019 the voice commented, but I barely registered the almost sardonic intonation.\n\n\r  \n\u2018I got there long before they opened, but so had hundreds of others. There was a line outside, stretching all the way through the parking lot. Even at five in the morning. So I stood there, behind this fat guy with a pillow in his hand. I didn\u2019t think anything of it at first, but as time went on and he ended up lying on the ground with it tucked under his head, I started to envy him. The centre didn\u2019t open until 9, so I had to stand there for four hours.\u2019\n\n\r  \n\u2018A considerable effort,\u2019 the voice said soothingly.\n\n\r  \n\u2018It was! And then I spent all day waiting to be seen, only to be told that I was too under-qualified for anything on their books and I needed to come back the next day when they might have some unskilled roles. I told them I would do anything, literally anything, and they said no. I got angry, they got angry. And I ended up being thrown out. It made no sense.\u2019\n\n\r  \n\u2018Didn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\n\r  \n\u2018No!\u2019\n\n\r  \n\u2018Were you drinking?\u2019\n\n\r  \n\u2018No! Not so you\u2019d notice! I had a few swigs in the car park over the four hours I was standing there, but lots of people were doing that. I can\u2019t have been the only one who had whiskey on his breath.\u2019\n\n\r  \n\u2018Is that what you told Carla?\u2019\n\n\r  \n\u2018Damn her!\u2019 I shouted in a flash of vicious anger. \u2018Yes that\u2019s what I told her. But she\u2019d already been on the phone with her friends. Some of their husbands had been in the line too \u2013 we\u2019d all lost our jobs when the plant closed \u2013 and they\u2019d heard what that job centre guy said. About me needing to clean myself up and come back the next day. Word had gone round that I\u2019d been drunk.\u2019\n\n\r  \n\u2018But you hadn\u2019t?\u2019\n\n\r  \n\u2018No! I\u2019d had a drink. I wasn\u2019t drunk. But she didn\u2019t believe me. She believed them.\u2019\n\n\r  \n\u2018So what did you do?\u2019\n\n\r  \nI smirked bitterly in the darkness.\n\n\r  \n\u2018I drank. I drank like crazy just to spite her. I drank everything in the fridge whilst she stood and shouted at me. I opened the cabinet and started on the whiskey as she screamed and cried in the kitchen. I was heading to the door to the garage to see what else I could find when I heard her on the phone. She\u2019d called the police. The police! She had me arrested. I was in jail overnight.\u2019\n\n\r  \n\u2018I\u2019m not surprised,\u2019 the voice said flatly, a note of disgust creeping into its icy tone.\n\n\r  \nI paused, blinking away the anger that had been rising up within me at the thought of that night. The police arriving, gripping me by the arms, dragging me to the car as I screamed and shouted at Carla. The neighbours staring. My dignity in tatters, my marriage on fire, my life in ruins. The awful way she\u2019d treated me since that day.\n\n\r  \n\u2018I said I\u2019m not surprised,\u2019 the therapist continued, \u2018what else should she have done? You\u2019d become a bum. A nothing. A down-and-out drunkard not fit for human company.\u2019\n\n\r  \n\u2018What the hell\u2026?\u2019 I stammered, taken aback by the suddenly vicious voice, the snarling contempt of the therapist\u2019s tone.\n\n\r  \n\u2018She could never love such a failure as you,\u2019 it continued mercilessly, a deep chuckle reverberating behind the words, as though emanating from another throat. A hideous sinking feeling settled into my stomach, festering alongside the anger, stoking it further. Fear. \u2018You\u2019re worthless. Reviled. Less than nothing.\u2019\n\n\r  \n\u2018Shut up!\u2019 I shrieked, my eyes frantically darting around the darkness of my basement, trying to locate the therapist and the dim light above his head. Only shadow swirled before me, the light extinguished. I tried to stumble to my feet, accidentally knocking the glass bottle I\u2019d kicked before. I made a blind grab for it as it tinkled into the darkness.\n\n\r  \nThe realisation flashed through my mind as my fingers brushed the bottle; therapists don\u2019t make house calls or conduct interviews in basements\u2026\n\n\r  \nMy mind cleared as the chuckling unseen thing in the blackness broke into full blown laughter. My hand closed around the weighty bottle, and I raised it in a two-handed grip as I faced where I thought the \u2018therapist\u2019 was.\n\n\r  \n\u2018You pathetic mess,\u2019 it spat at me in a rasping voice like death itself, \u2018you deserve everything you will get.\u2019\n\n\r  \nI screamed and threw myself at the darkness, brandishing the bottle in an overhead swipe I hoped would smash over my unseen tormentor\u2019s head. But then a light exploded into my eyes, a squeal of a basement door opening on a rusted hinge deafening me, and I stumbled at the dark figure silhouetted in the doorway. I fell bodily onto the figure, bringing down the bottle with as much force as I could muster. The body crumpled beneath me without a sound, and I landed awkwardly sprawled on it, my fall cushioned. I felt the crack of ribs beneath me and the warmth of blood on my hands, but it wasn\u2019t until I sat back that I realised what I\u2019d done.\n\n\r  \nMy vision swam in an alcoholic haze as I looked down on Carla\u2019s ruined face amid the shards of the whiskey bottle, and from somewhere far away I heard a deep, cruel laughter echoing in my mind.\n\n\r  \nI swear that\u2019s how it happened.\n\n\r  \nIt was the drink that killed [her.](http://sdjackson.blogspot.com/2023/05/the-shrouded-throne-available-now.html)",

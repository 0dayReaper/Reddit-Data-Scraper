    "postText": "_____\n\n\nThere are so many damn things we take for granted nowadays. Cell phone chargers are definitely one of them. \nI can\u2019t tell you how much I wanted to keep typing [after](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/13j6qhj/im_trapped_in_a_basement_elevator_alongside/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=15) all of us in this shitty elevator heard a shriek that sounded like the undead coming back from the grave, but I didn\u2019t have much choice but to conserve battery life given what happened next. \n\nI will do my best to update what happened in those terrifying moments. \n\nThe little girl was looking up at us, her body shaking as she told us to stay completely still. To my surprise, everyone in the elevator listened, even the fidgety army private. \n\nThe strange noise returned. It got closer, louder and more frantic. It sounded like it was right past the walls. \n\nAmanda was the only one who seemed uncertain what to do, but even though she couldn\u2019t hear the strange screams the elevator was vibrating and that seemed to be a sign for her to remain motionless. \n\nNext we heard what sounded like the scraping of claws against the metal. Loud and repetitive. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s right outside. Don\u2019t. Move,\u201d the girl whispers. Chlo\u00e9\u2019s eyes widen in fright and I can tell she is close to panicking. \n\nThen as suddenly as it comes, the strange noise ends and we are alone again. Only a distant wailing is heard as all stand there, too lost for words to even describe what happened. \n\nSidney is the one who steps toward the girl, who has now started to sit cross legged on the floor of the elevator. \n\n\u201cThank you, for\u2026 for telling us what to do,\u201d she says. The little girl ignores her and turns back to the wall, crouching in a ball again. \n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she will talk to you, probably still scared,\u201d Phil remarks. \n\n\u201cHow did she know what to do?\u201d Chlo\u00e9 asks. \n\n\u201cI told you that she knew what was going on. Something about her is off!\u201d the army private says next. \n\nI can\u2019t help but to be tired of his attitude. Although I have no idea what is going on, his conspiracy shit makes everything ten times worse.  \n\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned you\u2019re the only one who has been causing problems. Why are you even here in this building? Everyone else has told us bits and pieces of their story, why haven\u2019t you?\u201d I countered. \n\nI can\u2019t help but to mention how claustrophobic this place is. Anytime we are talking there is less than a few inches of space between us. We are literally breathing the same air. So when I confront the guy, I see the anxiety and anger on his face and I am terrified he is going to attack me like he did Phil. \n\n\u201cDoes it matter? We were strangers before we came into this mess. Let\u2019s keep it that way,\u201d he argues. \n\n\u201cKinda hard to do that when you\u2019re carrying a mystery bag around,\u201d Sidney points out. I\u2019m glad she has mentioned what worried Amanda earlier, but I don\u2019t like that everyone is becoming agitated. \n\n\u201cMy stuff is *my* stuff,\u201d he snaps back, pushing his backpack against the wall. \n\nI can tell this conversation is going nowhere and it feels like we are just making things worse. Maybe to distract ourselves from the danger outside. \n\n\u201cWe should get rest,\u201d Phil decides. \n\nSidney and Amanda also seem to agree it\u2019s time to relax especially after that scare. None of us wanted to even dare discuss what it meant. I slumped against the wall and try to find as much personal space as I can to relax. We are five grown adults trying to cram our bodies in a elevator not designed for this. Claustrophobia doesn\u2019t even begin to describe what I felt as I curled my legs under me and closed my eyes. \n\nI hope sleep comes easy. \n\nUPDATE \n\nAmanda is attempting again to sign instead of write because it is so dark but I can\u2019t really make heads or tails of it. I don\u2019t think anyone here understands what she is saying. Maybe it\u2019s a panic attack and she isn\u2019t thinking clearly like the rest of us. \n\nBut then to my surprise, the little girl is the one to offer a translation. \u201cShe asks how can we rest and be sure the monster won\u2019t return?\u201d \n\nI look toward the little girl and get a better view at her now. \nShe\u2019s possibly eight or ten. Somewhere in those pre-teen years where it\u2019s impossible to tell. Pale with blue eyes, freckles and dark red hair. \n\nFor some reason I feel like I have seen her before, before today I mean. But that couldn\u2019t be. Another strange memory that isn\u2019t making sense. \n\n\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m not sure. Will it come back?\u201d I ask the girl. \n\n\nShe diverts her eyes for a while, clearly not wanting to talk about it. But my questioning also stirs the interest of the others. The soldier isn\u2019t quite so subtle. \n\n\u201cYeah spit it out; how did you know anything about that thing? What *was* that anyway?\u201d he asked. \n\n\u201cEasy. She\u2019s just as scared as the rest of us,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 commented. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t have an answer for you anyway, only that I know it was here at the drop,\u201d she whispers. That piques my interest further and I sit up. \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026 like it caused it?\u201d I ask. \n\nShe curls her legs under her body a little bit more. \u201cIt took someone away.\u201d \n\nThen she turns back toward the wall, clearly wanting to end the conversation. \n\n\u201cWait. What the hell does that mean?\u201d The soldier asks. I\u2019m anxious to hear the answer too but the girl just mumbles that she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to talk about it. \n\n\u201cHold on now, I think we are all pretty open to talking about this, am I right? After all, we want out of here,\u201d Phil says, trying to coax the girl.  \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get out. Not unless it wants you out. Not unless it feeds on you,\u201d the girl whispers. \n\nAmanda is signing, undoubtedly asking what is going on. But the girl doesn\u2019t bother responding. \n\nChlo\u00e9 and I look at each other with more unease. We were only dealing with an ordinary crisis a few moments ago, but with these new ripples we all feel that we are in uncharted territory. \n\nWe sit there in the dark, in between exhaustion and paranoia trying to figure out what to do next. Everyone has stopped talking and seems to be falling asleep out of sheer desperation. I can\u2019t help but to feel like I need to eat or pee and I don\u2019t even know if either will be a possibility\n\nThe girl is humming softly to herself for a moment and then she finally falls asleep as well. Or at least that\u2019s what it sounds like. I keep my eyes closed as the rest of the group remains silent and each begin to softly snore. \n\nBut I\u2019m not planning on sleeping just yet. The last few hours have me on edge and I feel like I can\u2019t trust the people that are here in this elevator with me. \n\nCall me paranoid like the army guy if you want, but it makes me feel a little safer to keep one eye open. \n\nEventually even all is quiet and I decide to make my move. Phil is snoring to my left and I gently nudge myself to stand up and look at the others. Making sure they are asleep. Sidney, Chlo\u00e9 and Amanda are only an arm\u2019s length away all resting next to the door. And then the fidgety soldier  is stretched to the right wall, his backpack in between his legs  just a few feet in front of me. \n\nSlowly I slide back down into a crouching position,  I stretch my arm out and slide the backpack over toward me. It\u2019s time I see if I can find out more about this stranger, I thought. The only person unwilling to divulge any information was automatically a red flag and his shifty behavior told me that he HAD to know more about our situation then he was pretending to. \n\nIn the darkness it\u2019s difficult to see for sure what is inside the backpack so I reach in and feel around, letting my sense of touch guide me. \n\nAt the top layer it seems as though he has placed survival gear such as food, bandages and other tools, making me wonder just what he was in this building to begin with again.\n\nThen below that I feel a gun. \n\nI instinctively pull it out and realize that it\u2019s loaded with exactly enough bullets for all of us. My heart can\u2019t help but to skip a beat. \n\nThen he makes a soft grumble in his sleep and I freeze, worried he has woken. Instead he turns over and his hand flops onto the elevator floor, splayed out. \n\nI put the gun back in the bag and keep looking, finding a journal next. \n\nAt first I\u2019m very disappointed to find it looks normal. There aren\u2019t any incriminating photos or anything like that. My suspicion of him being here for ulterior motives feels unfounded. \n\nThen, just as I feel like calling it quits and resting for the remainder of the evening, a small piece of paper falls out. \n\n\nWhat the message says makes me rethink his innocence. \n\n*How much time is left?* \n\nMy heart starts to beat a little faster.\n\nAbove that note I can barely read something he scratched out:\n\n It looks like a list of names but I can\u2019t read it. \nIs the note talking about us, the people here in this elevator?\n\nI use my phone to get a better view of the scratched out list and realize one of the names is my own.  \n\nHow does this guy know who I am? It makes me feel very uncomfortable, especially when I connect it to the gun I found. \n\nWas he planning\u2026 to eliminate us?\n\n\nI\u2019m too terrified to answer that. Too confused and worried about the strange circumstances we have arrived at. \n\nAnd before I could come to my senses, to hide any further snooping, I felt a sharp blunt to my head. \n\n_________\n\nI think a few hours passed before I became conscious again. It\u2019s another thing we have to take for granted down here. There is no real way to keep track of time since most of our phones don\u2019t connect to any networks. \n\nAt first I\u2019m disoriented and trying to recall what happened. Then I remember the attack and my eyes dart open. \n\nChlo\u00e9 is standing there conversing with Phil but I am not awake enough yet to determine what they are saying. \n\n\u201cHey. You okay there bud?\u201d the young man who\u2019s backpack I rifled last night asks me. I stand up and glare at him, certain he is the one that knocked me unconscious. \n\n\u201cEveryone\u2026 I was\u2026  I was attacked last night,\u201d I said. \n\nI\u2019m still feeling dizzy, trying to get my surroundings. Even though we have practically spent a day together in this tiny prison, these people\u2019s faces aren\u2019t memorized yet. \n\nNames come back to mind faster as my eyes dart between them. Sidney... Amanda. Chlo\u00e9.. Phil. \n\nThe girl. \n\nWait. I look around again. \n\nThe girl is missing. \n\nSuddenly I feel the urge to get to the bottom of this no matter the cost and grab the young man and pin him to the wall. \n\u201cEli! What are you doing?\u201d Phil asked anxiously. \n\n\u201cGetting some damn answers,\u201d I say as I ball my hand into a fist and shout. \u201cTalk right now before I put a crater in your skull.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d Phil said as he grabbed me. I don\u2019t want to fight him, but he needs to understand. \n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you the least bit concerned about what the hell he did\u2026. What he knows? I looked through his backpack last night. He had a notebook that had my name in it. And he had a gun!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat in the hell are you talking about?\u201d the young man asked. \n\n\u201cShow us what\u2019s in the bag,\u201d I demanded. \n\n\u201cWhat? No!\u201d\n\nPhil seems uncertain what to do and corners the army guy. \u201cListen, it\u2019s time to come clean about this. What\u2019s in the bag?\u201d \n\nAll of us have him cornered. \n\nHe quickly takes off his bag and tosses it to us on the floor in the middle of our feet. \u201cI have nothing to hide here mate, same as you. You can look all you want,\u201d he says with a shrug. \n\nThe others let me go and I rummage through it but can\u2019t find a thing. \n\nNo note, no gun. \n\n\u201cHe must have hidden it. There must be a secret compartment in the elevator somewhere,\u201d I said as I look on the floor trying to find any clues to where he had managed to hide it. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you get it? He hurt that girl and now she is gone!!\u201d I screamed at them. \n\nI saw they all looked more frightened than before because of my outburst as I tossed the backpack toward the young man. \n\n\u201cI know you did something to her. So spit it out. Where is she?\u201d I snarled. \n\n\u201cEli, you need to calm down,\u201d Sidney insisted. \n\n\u201cCalm down? How can I when he literally just murdered a nine year old girl??\u201d I screamed. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we can sort this out by first treating your injury,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 said as she examined my head. \n\n\u201cYou must have had a pretty rough fall. It scared all of us and you\u2019ve been out for a while,\u201d she added. \n\n\u201c\u201dI\u2019m fine. I need to know what happened to the girl.\u201d\n\nNow instead of fear, they exchanged worried and distressed looks. \u201cEli, I think you need to lie down. Tell me more about the girl and then we can sort this out,\u201d she replied. \n\nFor a moment I almost feel relaxed in her words. Then what she actually said hits me like a freight train. \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean tell me more about her? She was *right* there,\u201d I snarl as I look at the blank wall. Any evidence of her drawings is long gone. \n\n\u201cEli. Take a look around. There is no girl,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 insists. \n\nI can hear the sincerity in her words. She truly has no memory of her. The others seem to have a similar confused and worried facial expression. But they are worried *because* of me. They think this is some sort of mental episode? \n\n\u201cYou need to chill,\u201d the fidgety army private says. Part of me wants to lash out again, but I\u2019m too terrified of the outcome to try. Everyone is looking at me as a threat. Maybe they are right?\n\n\u201cJust get some rest while we sort out how to get help?\u201d Chlo\u00e9 suggests. \n\nI nod and sit down, right where the girl had been. The steel floor of the elevator feels colder than ever. \n\nIt\u2019s ironic how I couldn\u2019t remember her at first and now I am obsessed with her disappearance. Was all of it in my head? It frightens me to consider I might be losing my grip with reality \n\nAs the others are preoccupied with the metal door again, Amanda slides over toward me. I know that she is probably equally frightened by my outburst so I apologize to her. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me,\u201d I admit to her. \n\nShe signs me something but then pauses halfway through, and writes it down hastily instead. \n\nAs she is scrawling the message I can see fear in her eyes. She doesn\u2019t want anyone to see what she is writing. \n\nThen she passes it to me. \n\nIt\u2019s a short message but it\u2019s enough to jar me again. To realize I know there is more going on here than meets the eye. \n\n*She was here*\n\nMy eyes widen as I realize she remembers her too. \n\nThen she quickly scrawls it out so no one knows what she wrote. \n\nShe makes a simple gesture for me to remain quiet and I nod only fractionally, a deep unsettling dread cradling me as I look toward the others in the elevator. \n\nThese people are the ones I\u2019m supposed to rely on to help each other and get out of here.\nAnd I can\u2019t trust any of them. \n\n[330](https://www.reddit.com/r/KyleHarrisonwrites/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)\n\n[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13l2qf8/im_trapped_in_a_basement_elevator_alongside/?)",

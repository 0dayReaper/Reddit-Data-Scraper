    "postText": "I\u2019ve been reflecting on my childhood. There\u2019s a trauma-shaped hole that incessantly niggles away at my mind. I remember deeply disturbing bits and pieces from my time in the Red Playroom, and that only makes me fear what I\u2019ve suppressed.\n\nI only ask whether any of you had such a room at school because I read something online that seemed eerily reminiscent of my experience. It made me think that my school\u2019s perturbing playroom might not have been an isolated anomaly.\n\nUnfortunately, I was right.\n\nI hosted a few friends at my house this evening, and most of them laughed at my seemingly-odd question, but Sarah didn\u2019t. Her saucer-eyed face trembled as she nodded slowly. She and I went to different schools, so that only confirmed what I had always feared: the Red Playroom was not a figment of my imagination. It was more sinister than I thought. And believe me when I tell you that what Sarah and I experienced was already sinister enough.\n\n\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d Sarah asked after the rest of our friends had left.\n\nI nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s all I\u2019ve been able to think about this evening. Who goes first?\u201d\n\nShe gulped. \u201cYou. Let me summon the courage.\u201d\n\n***\n\nAt my school, the Red Playroom was a dreaded place. None of us wanted to play in there. And the teachers never even told us about it. We just happened upon it. Wedged between a storage room and the far wall of the school, there was an inconspicuous door.\n\n\u201cDid this used to be here?\u201d Tim asked, pointing it out during our lunch break.\n\nHe opened the door to reveal a small box room \u2013 ten by ten feet \u2013 with bright-red walls, grey carpet, a tiled ceiling, and horrid, fluorescent lights. There was an assortment of various toys on the floor and the detached hood of a yellow, floral coat.\n\n\u201cWe should go and hand it in to Miss!\u201d Stacy chirped up.\n\nTim thumped her in the arm. \u201cSnitch. Don\u2019t ruin this cool little hideaway by telling the teacher that we\u2019re in here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 too bright.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd quiet,\u201d Thomasin whispered.\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d Tim laughed, bounding into the red room. \u201cThis can be our hideout.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should go in there,\u201d Stacy said.\n\n\u201cWell, go away then,\u201d Tim snorted, turning to me. \u201cJake?\u201d\n\nI begrudgingly stepped inside, not wanting to have my Cool Card revoked. The carpet felt too soft beneath my feet. That\u2019s a weird comment to make because I was wearing shoes, but it\u2019s the only way I can describe it. Everyone other than Tim seemed frightened. Being the boisterous leader of the group, he had to appear unfazed, but I always wondered whether he secretly felt what I know the rest of us must have felt.\n\nWe didn\u2019t belong there.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop Tim from taking us into the Red Playroom day after day, week after week. We just sat and talked, pretending not to be terrified of the uneven place. Tim said it was a great room for just \u201cgetting away\u201d from people. I think he wanted to seem tough. Tough enough to handle the horror.\n\nOne day, however, some new toys appeared.\n\n\u201cLook at this cool thing,\u201d Tim laughed, picking up a small ball with a smiley face on it. \u201cBuck the Chuckler, its tag says.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s horrible,\u201d Thomasin shuddered.\n\n\u201cNah, he\u2019s smiling! He\u2019s friendly!\u201d Tim smirked, preparing to throw Buck at Thomasin.\n\nShe winced, and Tim cackled, placing the ball back on the floor. I rolled my eyes at her, drawing circles in the air around my ear to indicate what I thought of Tim, and she giggled.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that one?\u201d Stacy asked, pointing at a small figurine on the ground.\n\nTim picked it up, and we gathered around to get a better look. It was a plastic man dressed in a green, hooded raincoat. At that moment, the bell sounded.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nAs we entered the classroom, something caught my attention.\n\n\u201cWhy did you bring that with you, Tim?\u201d I sighed.\n\nMy friend grinned, stroking the figurine. \u201cNobody\u2019s gonna miss him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, they will. You\u2019re gonna get in trouble,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Tim shrugged, fiddling with the figure\u2019s limbs. \u201cProbably gonna chuck it anyway. His arms and legs don\u2019t even move.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not an action figure, dumb-arse,\u201d I said, rolling my eyes.\n\nOn the way out of the classroom, Tim threw the figurine into the bin, much to my annoyance. I wanted to fish it out and put it back in the Red Playroom, but our teacher was standing nearby, and I didn\u2019t want to incriminate myself. So, I left it. And I wish that\u2019d been the end of the story.\n\nBut the next day, Tim was pale-faced and fidgety.\n\n\u201cWhat's up with you?\u201d Thomasin asked.\n\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Tim asked, absent-mindedly. \u201cNothing. Just... pulled an all-nighter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWanna go to the Red Playroom?\u201d Stacy asked, attempting to sound braver than usual.\n\n\u201cNah, that\u2026 that room\u2019s lame,\u201d Tim shivered.\n\nYet, when the girls moved out of ear-shot, my friend leaned over and whispered something unnerving.\n\n\u201cI saw the green raincoat man in my room last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you\u2013\u201d I began, but I was interrupted by the lunch bell.\n\nThat was when something happened which shattered my town for years to come.\n\nAs I was walking to the main school building, I noticed that Tim had fallen behind me. When I turned to face him, however, he was nowhere to be seen. Search parties worked tirelessly over the coming weeks, but the boy was never found. That was fifteen years ago, and his parents still long for answers. They\u2019re never going to get any because nobody would believe the truth.\n\nWhen I ran into the building to seek help, the door to the Red Playroom was gone, and I started to convince myself that I\u2019d imagined the entire thing. I think Stacy and Thomasin did the same. As I say, there are blank spots in my memory, but I\u2019m sure our fear of the room stemmed from things we\u2019d seen and heard in there. Terrors that I\u2019ve suppressed. I mean... I instantly knew the playroom was to blame for Tim\u2019s disappearance. And on the final day of primary school, two years after Tim\u2019s vanishing, I finally had confirmation.\n\nI was alone in the corridor, and I heard a creak from the far corner by the storage room.\nThe door to the Red Playroom had reappeared. And when I tentatively pushed it open, I found myself facing something haunting in the centre of the carpet.\n\nTwo figurines. The green raincoat man and what looked like a miniaturised version of my best friend.\n\nWhilst screaming in disbelief at what had become of Tim, I suddenly found myself in a deeper spiral of horror. The carpet began to tear, and long arms emerged through the floorboards. A life-sized version of the eerie raincoat figurine. The slim man looked at me with a face too smooth and featureless to be real \u2013 like the figurine on the floor, he seemed to be composed of plastic or resin.\n\nAs his spindly fingers shot towards me, I screeched, fell backwards, and slammed the door on his arm. But his fingers curled around the edge of the door, and I prepared to join Tim. At least he won\u2019t be alone in that evil room, I thought, frightfully sobbing.\n\n\u201cJake!\u201d Miss Hall shouted.\n\nHands pressed on the door, I spun to face the frowning teacher in the corridor, and just like that, I realised my mistake. The woodwork vanished from my fingers, and when I turned to face the wall, it was just that \u2013 a wall.\n\nI\u2019ve visited the school numerous times over the past fifteen years, but the Red Playroom has never reappeared. Tim is lost forever.\n\n***\n\nAfter I finished speaking, Sarah\u2019s face was completely frozen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026 You don\u2019t have to tell your story,\u201d I said.\n\nShe shook her head. My friend did have a story, but she didn\u2019t tell it in words. She told it by slowly pulling a hand out of her pocket.\n\n\u201cThis is Jennifer,\u201d She whispered.\n\nSarah revealed a figurine of a small girl with a yellow, floral coat.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

My high school used to be a joint primary and high school (Kindergarten to Year 10) up until 1983 when it became a boys' only high school (Year 7 to Year 12).\n\nUnder the school, the hallways were reminiscent of a WWII air raid shelter, but with storage rooms full of chairs and tables for events set up in the gym. We had like triple the numbers of chairs and tables compared to how many we needed for even the biggest events like Galas or our annual festival so there was always furniture that looked like it hasn't been touched in decades\n\nI swear on my name there was a brown door frame jutting out of the empty space between the tallest pile at the back, and the ceiling. Can't confirm if it *was* such a room but having done work at the school during my time as an electrician, I can confirm via floor maps that nothing should have been beyond that wall let alone a room. \n\nStill can't explain it to this day, and your story just hammered it home for me to avoid that storage room like the plague",

It shouldn't have been there, and it shouldn't have led to anything, but it did. One room, one way in and out, and yet I could *swear* there was something else in there. The floor was weird and kinda spongy, and the... well frankly I'm not sure what to call them, walls doesn't quite fit. I assume it's because our play structure was outside, but the walls kinda faded off at the top, and there was just an endless blue sky above us. No clouds or anything like that.\n\nI only went in the one time, so I can't confirm that we encountered the same phenomenon at all, but I know one of my friends went there another time. I know because the tunnel disappeared on the same day he did.\n\nI think we all blocked out the memory of him, even now I have trouble recalling his name. My old friends don't remember him either, and neither does anyone in my family. I know he came over at least once, but my parents have assured me he must have been an imaginary friend.\n\nSorry if this isn't very cohesive I just- it's a lot, y'know?  I'd almost forgotten all about James and the sky room until now.",

White with a big gray carpet like yours (odd coincidence) The worse part? There was a persistent portrait hanging on of the larger walls that I swear was staring back at us\u2026. The portrait was of a man in a hoodie or a robe so that you couldn\u2019t make out his face, but you could see his eyes. Cold, dark, purple, eyes. It was like staring into the abyss and by god it was fucking staring back. I\u2019m fairly certain we all knew right then and there that that picture was not natural and that room wasn\u2019t the place to be, so we all tried bolt. Now, I\u2019ve been reading stories and watching enough things to know that some entities will leave you alone mostly\u2026. As long is they\u2019re respected. So when one of my friends ran panicked into the wall where the portrait was trying to find his way out (he doesn\u2019t have very good eyesight), I\u2019m pretty sure the color drained from my face because when everyone looked at me they were confused as to why I was so frightened. Sure the picture was creepy, but it was just that, a picture. But I knew better. Somehow I just knew better. So when all light went out, when barely any sound reached our ears, when the air began to feel cold and heavy, I nearly lost it. Everyone else was screaming and having panic attacks and I almost joined them in their hysteria, I\u2019m lucky the rational part of my brain won. Now I had to figure out how the hell to get us out of there. I had no idea how I would even go about that much less accomplish it. And then a door opened, the only thing bringing light into the darkness we were cast into. We all ran to the door hopeful, but not before I looked back to see the man in the picture had *crawled out* and said words that made my blood run cold:\n\n\n*Hello little ones. You\u2019ve committed a grave error in judgment\u2026. you must pay for your sins, and so your time has come to end\u2026*\n\n\nI knew he was pissed off about that picture. \n\n\nHe then proceeded to slam the door shut, showing that this space was under his absolute control. We all lost hope right then and there, we each waited in darkness and prepared for death. A horrible sound followed. It almost sounded like\u2026. A bell\u2026?\n\n\n\nAnd to this day, I don\u2019t understand how we ended up in the middle of the hallway. Everyone woke up screaming and shaking. \n\n\n\nWe never talked about it again. Everyone had pretty much suppressed the memory except me. See I grew up reading scary stories and whatnot, but they were just that. Stories. I never though any of it was real. \n\n\nNot until I saw those eyes. \n\n\nI wonder why it decided to let us go. Being knocked down from its perch was a slight that he clearly didn\u2019t appreciate. But it only robbed us of our senses and released us. \n\n\nI wonder why mine was white and you and hers were red? And why did I get a portrait? Unanswered question bother me lol. I\u2019m glad your safe and I\u2019m worried for your friend.",

After noticing something being off, I tricked this teacher into entering this room on his own. He was never found and the police found out he was abusing his child &amp; wife as at home as well so I did not feel bad for him.",

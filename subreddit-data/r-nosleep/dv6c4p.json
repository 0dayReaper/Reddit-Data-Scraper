    "postText": "You\u2019ve heard of them. They started as a tool to help calm autistic people and people with anxiety and insomnia. Over the past few years they\u2019ve grown into a popular household item, and with good reason. They\u2019re comforting. \n\nWe\u2019d pay just about anything for some comfort. Do you ever notice how that\u2019s most of what we spend our money on now, us single guys? Why do we constantly crave to be comforted?\n\nMy life wasn\u2019t particularly uncomfortable. Not then. I had finally gotten back track with reality after the disappearance of my wife and kids two years ago. I\u2019d sold our little house in the suburbs, gotten a cheap apartment close to my job, attended all the therapy appointments the police and caseworkers recommended, and gone back to work. I still couldn\u2019t sleep for more than an hour or two a night, even with the medications they gave me, but that was okay. The worst of it was over. Shock and grief can only last so long. \n\nI got one anyway; ordered the thing off Amazon. In queen size, like all my bedding, even though my queen no longer slept in it. \n\nIt arrived ridiculously late. I\u2019m a Prime member, and I selected the free two day shipping. But it at least had gotten there, so I didn\u2019t send a complaint, despite the state it was in after its long journey - not in the familiar smiley cardboard box, but in a shapeless lump haphazardly placed halfway on my front doorstep, halfway in the parking lot. It had been clumsily wrapped in brown paper and tied with a string, and possibly kicked the whole way here, from the look of it. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a quaint, rustic thing,\u201d I announced (to nobody in particular) as I dragged it into my apartment. \u201cA present from grandma, back home, uh, on the ranch!\u201d \n\nBut even talking to myself couldn\u2019t convince me. It looked like a bomb, delivered straight off the set of an action movie. The package was beaten up, stained, and the rough jute string was frayed and nearly falling apart. It looked singed in several places, too. It took me two hours, three gin and tonics, and a hearty microwave dinner to work up enough courage (or suicidal depression) to actually open the thing. \n\nThe blanket was bundled into a poorly-folded cube, held together by another length of the same string that had bound the paper. I wasn\u2019t impressed with its packaging, but the blanket itself looked alright - plush, quilted blue microfiber with thick seams - and felt like it was the right weight. It smelled normal; you know that clean but vaguely chemical-ish odor new blankets have. \n\nI checked the tag, wondering if I ought to clean it, but the ink was smeared and blurry. It seemed risky to throw it in the washing machine without knowing the correct settings to use, so I just threw it over my duvet and went about my business. \n\nAt around midnight I decided to give it a try. I had nothing left to lose; I\u2019d spent hundreds of dollars on my bed over the past few months; the newest and best quality memory-foam adjustable cooling mattress, thousand count Egyptian cotton sheets, customizable-filling pillows, and none of it had brought me a single good night\u2019s sleep. Honestly I expected the same to happen that night, but it was fun to pretend. \n\nI slid between the cool sheets and pulled the blankets up over me. The new blanket was a bit lumpy, but I knew from reading reviews that this was normal due to shipping, and would smooth out over time. The weight was immediately noticeable, and to my surprise, I felt...comforted. \n\nWhen I closed my eyes, I imagined my youngest two had crawled into bed with us, and were laying on top of me, suppressing giggles as they tried not to wake me up. An artfully folded section of the blanket at my back became the familiar bulk of my wife beside me, and when I opened my eyes again it was ten in the morning and I was late for work. \n\nI\u2019ve never been so thrilled to receive a write-up. \n\nThat weird chemical smell didn\u2019t really fade, though, and gradually it became more noticeable. By the end of the week I could smell (or imagined I could) the strange, neutral odor on my skin, even after a shower. By the end of the month, it had become unbearable. \n\nI took it to a dry cleaners, thinking that I\u2019d been lazy because I was so enamored over my renewed relationship with sleep. I was ready for the elderly Korean woman behind the counter to judge me over the stink. I had my excuses rehearsed; work was crazy, I\u2019d had it in my car and forgotten, and I\u2019d had Indian food for lunch and forgotten the leftovers in my car over the weekend, which had amplified the smell. \n\nBut I didn\u2019t have a chance to recite this story. She only waved a handheld metal detector over my blanket and said, \u201cFilling wrong. Can\u2019t clean. Try spray with Fabreeze! You can get on Amazon!\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine what about the filling could be wrong, and I told her so. Sure it was still a bit clumpy from shipping, but Amazon had listed the filler as polypropylene, and all the reviews recommended dry-cleaning. \n\n\u201cMetal,\u201d she explained, then shooed me out the door with twenty pounds of smelly quilt in my arms. \n\nAnother month of beautiful, comfortable sleep went by before I couldn\u2019t live with the smell anymore. People had begun to comment on it at work. Megan, my manager, had tactfully suggested I check my laundry machine to see if maybe a rat had gotten in there and died or something. That was my last straw. \n\nI came home determined to get rid of the blanket and buy a new one. But you know what happens when you lose your entire world, with no answers? You start to cling to things. You hoard them. Because you can\u2019t lose the comfort they bring you. \n\nI tried six dry cleaners before I found one who spoke enough English (through a heavy Boston accent; but you can\u2019t have everything) to explain it to me. \n\n\u201cSometimes they fill these with glass beads,\u201d he said. \u201cThe factories that make the beads, they\u2018ll lose a screw or some metal filings in the batch, and it all goes into the blanket. Machines in factories, you get me? Yeah, so what you can do is cut the seam a little and dump the balls into a bucket or the bathtub or something. Throw the blanket in the wash, hang it up to dry. Then you just pour \u2018em back in and sew it up.\u201d\n\nI told him I didn\u2019t know how to sew. \n\n\u201cYou can get a funnel off Amazon for a few bucks,\u201d he said, and shrugged at me in a particularly apathetic sort of way before turning back to a pile of stained panties. \n\nI did exactly that. They took a week to ship it, which was annoying, but it was a bank holiday that Monday so the delay made sense. \n\nArmed with my funnel and a bucket, I pulled the edge of the blanket over the bed and cut a tiny hole into the seam near the corner. I expected the beads to come pouring out in a clattery flood as soon as I dropped the corner into the bucket. Instead there was a single, loud thump as a lump of something metallic hit the plastic. \n\nI peered into it and saw a gold circle. A wedding ring with a fingerprint carved into it, and an inscription on the inside that I couldn\u2019t see because a chunk of meat and bone were still inside it, but I knew what it said. It said \u201cto love\u2019s eternal glory\u201d. It was my fingerprint on the band. \n\nMy mind went blank and I lost control of my legs, forcing me to sit heavily on the edge of my bed. The motion tugged the blanket over another few inches, and more of the filling came out. This wasn\u2019t a flood, it was more of a...heave, like the blanket was vomiting up pieces of crumbling, dry flesh and bone. Like a cyst being squeezed, thick clumps of horribly recognizable stuff squirted out into the bucket. My oldest son\u2019s teeth clattered loudly against the sides, and I saw flashes of silvery fillings from the cavities caused by gum disease he\u2019d inherited from his mom. \n\nThere was a scrap of almost-bleached-white Hello Kitty band-aid wrapped around a tiny knuckle joint, and I remembered how my daughter had scraped her finger knocking loudly on her brother\u2019s splintered bedroom door, and how she\u2019d smiled through her tears when she saw the special, fun band-aid her daddy had put over the scratch. \n\nI\u2019d been sleeping for two months beneath the heavy weight of a thousand mummified pieces of my wife and children\u2019s bodies. \n\nThe cops couldn\u2019t trace the package, even though they tried. The security cameras in my apartment complex showed an unmarked brown van with no license plate, which dumped the package directly from the window onto my front step. There was nothing to track. \n\nAmazon\u2019s lawyers provided evidence proving they\u2019d packed and shipped the correct (boxed and labeled) blanket. Let me be fair to them; I must say that they offered me a prompt refund. \n\nIn store credit. \n\nBut I won\u2019t be buying anything off Amazon ever again. I\u2019ve gotten rid of my Echo; that was the first thing I threw out, along with all my new bedding, and I canceled my Prime membership. Just for good measure, I threw out my smartphone and smartwatch as well. Amazon and smart technology are convenient and that\u2019s great, but it\u2019s not worth the risk if things like this can happen. \n\nIt\u2019s the only possible explanation, after all - how else could they have found the bodies?",

And the guy hacked into this dude's Echo in the first place. Someone who respects other people's boundaries in a healthy manner shouldn't have done it in the first place.\n\nOn the other hand we only see one side of the story. OPs family surely wasn't alone in the world. They probably had friends, relatives, clubs. Maybe someone suspected OP from the start and then deliberately hacked him to get evidence against him that he then couldn't use because it was obtained illegally. Or directly going the vigilante path, if he suspected whatever punishment OP would get wouldn't be enough.\n\nWho knows.",

Then place them into a weighted blanket and throw it outside his house right when he had just recently ordered such a weighted blanket.  \n\nIf someone else had hidden the bodies op wouldn't be worried about being tracked. Why hide the bodies if you didn't do it and be spooked when they got found? Maybe some outside circumstance could lead to a man innocent of murder secretly hiding the corpses of their family  but it's quite remote.",

Body-sniffing dogs are trained not to alert to deer or other wildlife, so authorities wouldn\u2019t question it and would dig past the deer. But they can\u2019t train a dog entirely out of responding to the smell of dog, especially a newly dead one (it usually takes a little longer than 30 days to escalate a body-hunt to the point of calling in cadaver dogs, so you have some wiggle room here). \n\nBury the human at around 8-10 ft, and the dog at 4-5 (average kid-height). So ideally, the dogs will be so distressed by the presence of another dead dog that any continued alerting will be presumed a false alarm. But if they do continue digging, they\u2019ll give up after six feet more with nothing.",

IT NEVER FAILS. High pitch kill my ears barking. Yet I can be awake for 20 hours. Dog never barks. Lay down to sleep-SQUEAKY BARKS. I went out of town over weekend, so excited I get to sleep in a cold dark hotel room. I swear... I heard that dog.. phantom barks. I honesty think I am losing my mind. Now I am thinking horrible thoughts about the dog. I am animal lover, have three dogs myself, but they calm and don\u2019t make much noise, just normal dog stuff, but THAT DOG. I want it dead. I talked to my neighbor and they just chalk it up, she is just \u201cbeing a dog\u201d. I expressed my lack of sleep due to their dog, and they thought I was being silly. As I type this in bed... it is barking. I have even thought about selling my house JUST BECAUSE OF THIS AND I AM GOING MAD.  I would do anything for one night... of solid sleep. I cannot wear earplugs due to me having to get up early for work, I need an alarm since I don\u2019t sleep much due to this little shit driving my nuts, with ear plugs I cannot hear it. I have called police, complained of after hours noise complaint, once again not taken seriously.  It\u2019s like I am the only one affected. If I see that little shit lose, I would seriously think about running it over. I am horrified at myself for even THINKING like this. This is not me thinking so evil and cold. I don\u2019t know what else to do as I lose myself into madness over this and no sleep.  This has been going on for 5 years.",

This might be fixable with insulation replacement/upgrade. \n\nIf she\u2019s leaving her dog outside all night, just call the non-emergency line for your local police department. Make reports as many times as you need. The cops won\u2019t do anything about it, but then if you run it over you have plausible deniability yourself in the event that she tries to accuse you of doing it on purpose or even of letting the dog out. It\u2019s proof that she doesn\u2019t contain the dog properly at night. \n\nMen like you and I need to think about things like this.",

Alexa can't figure that out unless you brainstorm exact locations within earshot or hide them under your floorboards. \n\nYour smartphone though can find out exactly were you went and hid some bodies if it was in your pocket. Cross the alexa recording with the phones GPS and hey bingo a little map of were the bodies are hidden shows up. Maybe with a audio recording of him digging the ditch to throw them in. \n\nTypical horror stuff.",

That's how voice activated things work, otherwise they would require a button to be pressed before the microphone turns on. \n\nSecond, he probably had his cellphone or even a smartwatch on him when he went to hide the bodies. When OP said \"halfway on my doorstep and halfway on the parking lot\" it suggests that he lives in some sort of housing complex, as houses with yards and such don't have parking lots. This means that OP had to drive to some secluded spot, well outside of his usual commutes to work, errand running, etc. If his phone was tracking his location via GPS, one would be able to tell from the data that he mysteriously and inexplicably travelled out to a random secluded area, spent an hour or so there, and then left; at the exact moment that his family went missing. Fairly damning evidence, especially if one were to go and search that particular spot.",

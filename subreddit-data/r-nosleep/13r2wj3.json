    "postText": "Finding land was always the hardest part of owning a construction company.  Every time I seemingly found the perfect lot, I\u2019d always find something that fucked it all up.  It was back to square one after that.  All the useful lots were usually taken by some greedy whippersnapper farmers that were left a little nest egg.  My small town was quickly growing, and adding new housing was critical.  Furthermore, with the budget heading on a one way trip to oblivion, I needed to find good land to buy.\n\nWhile I sucked down my eighty-seventh-and-a half coffee of the day in a caffeine filled rage, I noticed a FOR SALE CHEAP sign sticking out on the soil.  Some old geezer sat right beside it with his rinky-dink rusty RV.\n\nMy workers and I hooted and hollered at our find from the cockpits of their excavators; our business would live another day.  We\u2019d finally managed to hit the jackpot.\n\nOr, at least I thought I did.Instead of being eager or excited about selling the land, his eyes were bloodshot, his lower jaw permanently stuck out in a troglodyte fashion, and his outstretched hand was shaking and rattling like a leaf.\n\nGetting out of my truck, I waltzed over to the old man.  \u201cHow much for the land?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cEighty bucks\u2026\u201d The old man croaked.\n\nMy eyes widened.  This had to be some kind of dream.  I shrugged at my workers.  \u201cWhy is the price so low?\u201d\n\nThe geezer pointed off towards the northwest.  My eyes scanned a patch of\u2026something.\n\nFissures and pits dug into a beige spot with some occasional splotches of purple.  Its edges were smooth, blending in with the grass in patches like the contours on army camouflage pants.  Its perimeter could not be determined, but it was at least 50 feet wide.  The indentations held a soup of dirt and backwash, making the whole mass resemble a giant partially eaten saltine cracker.\n\nMother nature liked to use our town as her pissing ground, so flooding, rain and washed up junk wasn\u2019t uncommon.  But it didn\u2019t explain how irregular the whole surface was.  That didn\u2019t matter, though; even if the land was crap, I still could make do.\n\n\u201cIt looks like a boring patch of sandstone.  That\u2019s it?  That\u2019s what you are so worried about?  You\u2019ve got a deal!\u201d I said to the seller.  Exchanging money for the land, he limped off to his RV and proceeded to floor it.\n\nI turned to my workers.  All they did in response was exchange glances about the rock formation.  I rested my finger under my chin.\n\nKneeling on the ground to investigate the patch, I tugged at the surface.  A sheet of translucent material gummed up my gloves when I scratched the surface.  Peeling off a piece, I held it up to the clear blue sky.  Scratches marked its surface, leaving it chalky and brittle like talc.\n\nThen, something caught my eye.  Pink rings covered the pits right where the semisolid muck breached the surface.  I crouched on all fours.  Sandstone could come in multiple colors and unique layers, but the sides looked\u2026\n\nRaw, slippery, and unnaturally shiny.\n\n\u201cBring a jackhammer,\u201d I demanded.  Someone came over, waddling with the heavy tool, plugging it in and activating the steel beast.\n\nThey shoved the drill bit into one of the pinkish borders.  With a switch flick, it activated, burring into it.  The worker grits their teeth, trying to steady it.  The liquid in the pores splashed around in mini tsunamis.  Suddenly, the ground shook underneath.  There\u2019s no way it could have come from the jackhammer; the activity was much too intense.  I scratched my neck and stroked my beard.\n\nIt was nothing greater than a few small subterranean tremors.  The thing was, earthquakes weren\u2019t common around here.  The town was in the middle of the Midwestern United States, completely away from any tectonic plates.  When the activity ceased, the pink walls didn\u2019t have any dents.\n\nAdjusting my hard hat, I facepalmed.  Sandstone would have crumbled with little effort.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of rock is this?\u201d I thought.  The situation was just a minor setback, though.  More firepower was needed.  It was time to blow something up.\n\n\u201cGet the M80\u2019s\u2026\u201d I ordered.\n\nOne of the workers brought a bag filled with the bombs. They almost resembled stringy worms jutting out of explosive, deformed apples.  I took out my cigarette lighter, picking out one of the M80s and throwing it into the middle of the pitting.\n\n\u201cTake cover!\u201d I barked.  We dove away from the ravine, bracing for it.  Then, it blew up, sending the mixture of dirt and water skyrocketing to the sides and raining down in brown snowballs.  Getting out of my huddle, I investigated the results.  The ground rumbled once more, the tremors far more intense than before.\n\nThe dirt had jettisoned from the ravines and holes, but the surface itself still remained intact.  I groaned.  \u201cWell, shit,\u201d I muttered.  Pacing around the parameter of the flesh-colored stone, I thought up a plan.  The merged holes were large enough to fit some men inside, but they were too narrow to fit a scoop.\n\nThen, one finally hatched.\n\n\u201cBring out some slack lines!  I want the area cleaned and dug up by the end of the day!\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\n\n\\---\n\nTen men were sent into the pits, glowing bungee cords wrapped around their waists.  Each were armed with massive drills and a large bucket.  After a few hours of digging, the smell of rotting onions wafted deep within the pits.  When I looked down inside, the topsoil was completely removed, replaced with nothing but a steaming, yellow-white chowder.\n\n\u201cDid I just uncover a sulfur pit?\u201d  I wondered.  Though our town was known for mining, we\u2019ve never uncovered any rocks like these.  We were known for mining salt and coal, not sulfur.  Of course, running into unwanted sedimentary rock was normal in a mining operation.  When I took a closer look, my workers\u2019 boots were sinking in\u2026muck?  So much for my conclusion about sulfur.\n\nTying a rope around my waist, I repelled down for an inspection.  My boots squished the thick white tar, surrounding the sides of the wall.  I stuck my hand into the concoction and gave it a sniff.  Throwing it on the ground with a plop, I covered my nose in disgust.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is that stuff?!  Smells like burning sweat socks!\u201d I exclaimed.\n\n\u201cShould we continue our work?  Seems kind of sketchy.  I mean, this doesn\u2019t look like much of a rock formation to me,\u201d a worker asked.\n\nI gazed at the rim of my hardhat.  \u201cOk, this obviously isn\u2019t going to work out.\u201d  I glanced up at the hot sun.  Raising a hand to my face, I try to make out if there were any other good sources of land.  All around us for miles were hundreds of corn farms.  Getting a permit to take the land a la eminent domain was out of the question.  That law-based bullshit would take way too long.  Even then, there was no way I could convince those other farmers to fork over some land.  My company needed profits and fast.  \u201cKeep digging.  I\u2019ll be gone for an hour.\u201d\n\nAs I got into my car, I requested a right hand man to keep watch while I traveled to the nearest hardware store.  While I got back on the road, I caught another formation resembling the ravines and pits back at the main site.  I squinted at the formation, surmising about what to do with that section.  Maybe it was my chance to acquire even more land and possibly save the company?\n\n\\---\n\nBy the time I got back, the holes had doubled in size.  When I peered down into the pockets, all that showed up was a black void.  The fluids inside had drained away, leaving only a crust of dirt and that same creamy slime on the sides.  I tied one of the harnesses around me, attaching a cable from a winch to the front and attached a bright yellow flashlight to my hat.  I jerked my head to the side, demanding that others follow.\n\n\u201cSir, I don\u2019t think this is a good idea\u2026\u201d A coworker says, holding up a finger.\n\n\u201cThis is the last place we can afford.  If we don\u2019t get any profits, this company AND US ALL go under.  I\u2019m not doing this for just myself.  I\u2019m doing this all for every one of you!  So get to work!\u201d  I snapped, pointing off to the other formation.  \u201cAnd while we descend, send another excavation team to that other rock formation way over yonder.  Maybe that will help us find a way to get rid of this formation.\u201d\n\nInstantly, they all put on their harnesses and activated their lights.  I position myself over the edge of a hole, just big enough for me and one other to enter.  With a thumbs up, the winches unwound.  As I pressed my boots against the unknown rock wall, tremors resonated through the chambers once again.\n\nOur lanterns pierced through the darkness, but still weren\u2019t able to reach the bottom of the pits.  After a few minutes of descending, a greasy substance started to coat the walls.  I began sweating from the heat and moisture rising from the pit below.\n\nSlowly, every one of us falls into the pits, scanning the surrounding area. One of the coworkers shone a light on the surface directly above us.  Growths resembling oversized tongues glistened with dripping unidentifiable substances.  Looking up, the ceiling glistened a fleshy pink color. Masses of semisolid substances gathered into lukewarm, gray pearls that stuck out and hung, similarly to disco balls at nightclubs.\n\nThen, I put everything together.  The clear sheets of rock on the surface, the strange white liquids that filled the cavities, and the pink insides.\n\nThese were giant blackheads in the ground.  What else could it have been?  The liquid was pus, the sheets were dead skin, and the pink insides were pores.  I gaze up at the hole above, hyperventilating.  If I wanted to get rid of these, I needed to find the source and destroy it from within.  Only then would the land be saved.\n\nOff in the distance towards the north, I could make out the opening of some kind of cave.  Pockmarks of light shone through newly excavated holes.  My walkie talkie vibrated.\n\n\u201cYou are not going to believe this, but I think these aren\u2019t rock formations.  They\u2019re blackheads.\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d  The person on the other line paused.  \u201cNow that I think of it, it sort of makes sense.  I knew something was up with the formations and all the crusty stuff.  There\u2019s no way in hell that this formation is just boring old rock.  Should I explore the surrounding area?\u201d The voice on the other line replied.\n\n\u201cYeah.  Go ahead.\u201d  I responded.  \u201cLower down some M80\u2019s!\u201d I shouted to the ceiling.  While I waited for the explosives, I signaled for the groups above to lower us deeper into the chasm.  My walkie talkie vibrates again.\n\n\u201cWe seem to be on some kind of spongy surface.  It\u2019s more moist than a shower loofa.  What about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on a second, we\u2019re all lowering down.\u201d  I signal for the winches above to unwind slowly.  Warm air blows on my back, coating it in a cape of stench.  The lower we descended, the more concentrated it grew.\n\n\u201cWe should have brought gas masks; the smell is nauseating down here!  Tell me what exactly do you see?\u201d I say.  Before I knew it, a bucket of M80\u2019s was dropped down on another line.\n\n\u201cWell the surface is mostly flat and the whole area is incredibly pink.  When do you think we should use the explosives?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot until we find the source of the trouble.  Anything towards the mouth of the cave?\u201d\n\nI could hear rhythmic squelches and plops.  \u201cOutside from some dripping stalactites and stalagmites, nothing seems to be out of the ordinary.\u201d\n\nThen, my back started to tingle.  Oxygen was replaced entirely by the festering, infectious smell.  It tore at my nostrils.  I wretched, casting my head aside in case if I needed to spill my guts.\n\n\\*Hisssssssssss\u2026\\*Something was brewing deep below my feet.  Droplets of an unknown substance burst in a manner similar to popcorn, bouncing in the heat.  Looking all around the shimmering, mucous void, suspicion ate at me like wasp larvae in a caterpillar.\n\nWhen the realization hit, my stomach dropped.\n\n\u201cSTOP!\u201d I shouted.  Everyone\u2019s line stopped in a blink.  They chattered amongst themselves, wondering what the commotion was all about.  From the quietness of the antechamber, I could hear bubbling and churning fluids.  They were no more than a meter away.  When I pointed the light downwards, I couldn\u2019t find a bottom to the mysterious hot spring.  The surface just shimmered a sickly bile yellow.  I turned to my other workers.  Their heads began to wobble slightly.  My vision warped and melted while my eyes grew heavier than sixteen ton weights.\n\n\u201cLook out below!\u201d A worker hollered from the top of the ravines.  Everyone came to an abrupt stop.  A hammer fell from above, plummeting directly towards me.  It shined in our torches.  It landed right into the fluids with a fierce hiss.  White foam grew from the bubbling pit.  When I stuck my hand in the fluid, it corroded and burned my skin.  Acid.\n\nI hoisted myself up before dizziness could consume me.\n\n*Ka-thump, ka-thump, ka-thump.*  \u201cHang on a second, I\u2019m picking up something.  Let me investigate.\u201d\n\nWas that a heartbeat?  \u201cWait a minute.  I don\u2019t think those are stalactites.\u201d\tThe pink spongy surface, the dead skin, the blackheads, the vat of acid, the heartbeat.  This wasn\u2019t a cave.  The whole stinkin\u2019 thing was an *animal*.  And we were in its stomach.\n\nMy blood froze.    I could make out someone faintly lighting something.  Looking down at the acid pit and source of the mysterious noise.\n\nI gasp.  \u201cDON\u2019T LIGHT THOSE EXPLOSIVES!\u201d\n\n\u201cIs something wrong, boss?\u201d A coworker replies on the other line.\n\nSuddenly, the cavern mouth snapped shut.  A roar bellowed throughout the entire cavern, a horrid mix between an extraterrestrial shriek and someone\u2019s throat being slit.   I shielded my ears from the cacophony.\n\nOff in the distance, the ground rose and sloped, plunging my men all towards the acid.  If it wasn\u2019t for the winch lines, they all would have been dissolved into bones.  Screaming echoes as everyone frantically wound themselves up.\n\n\u201cWIND US BACK UP, NOW!\u201d I ordered.  My vision goes slurry in seconds.  I could barely make out my coworkers as they rose up to the surface.  Blurry flesh lines began to surround me.  They grew larger and wider by each passing second.  Another bellow rocked my eardrums.  I struggled to snap myself out of my lethargy and gripped onto the lines, desperately pulling myself away from the gas and towards any area with oxygen.  My line hoists me far enough from the gas for me to breathe.\n\nJust like that, my vision cleared up.  I rubbed my eyes, wondering what the mysterious shapes were.  Shining my light on one of them, stomach walls began to converge in thick curtains directly towards me.  They scooted along the bottom of the lining, rumbling.  Fluids below churn like a violent storm.  The resonating bellows ripple against the converging walls.\n\n\u201cKEEP WINDING!\u201d I yelled until I swore my throat would bleed.  I looked all around me.  Everyone else had ascended up the blackhead holes in time.  I forced myself up the cords even higher, hoping I would be able to dodge the structures closing in.\n\nScanning around, that same rotten smell started to rise once again.  Slowly, it grew more and more noxious.  I was being wound back up, so I wondered how this could be happening.\n\nI lowered my head; the acid was rising.\n\n\u201cWINCH FASTER!\u201d I hollered above.  Throwing my jack hammer away and getting rid of the extra weight, the winch increases in speed.\n\nThen, with a *clank*, the whole hoisting mechanism stops.  My heart skips a beat. \u201cWhat are you doing?!  Pull me out!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe winch is stuck!\u201d\n\nEverywhere around me, the walls continued converging.  Four corners of the walls were at least 30 meters away and gaining.  Their glistening sides made me hyperventilate in fear.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there!  Pull me out!\u201d  I scanned all around, hoisting myself up even further.  Before I knew it, the flesh walls were only 20 meters away.  Up above the whole, everyone on the surface began to pull.  I grip on to the line, holding for dear life.  I let go only for a moment to throw a few M80s.  They blossom into an orange explosion in seconds, stopping the walls and making the beast howl in rage.\n\nWith that small window of opportunity, the rest of the workers yanked me out.  In an instant, we all hightailed it out of the area, away from the pissed off behemoth.\n\n\\---\n\nWhen word got out that thing existed, everyone quickly abandoned our town, migrating elsewhere.  My construction company nearly vanished along with the rest of the town.  Thankfully, my loyal workers were able to stick along with me thanks to a lovely invention called a bank loan.  Eventually, I settled down in a nice urban city where I am writing this now.\n\nIn retrospect, rural living isn\u2019t such a good idea.  With all that open space, no one can ever know what\u2019s underneath the soil.  That is, until they see the blackheads.  And that beast was only in hibernation.\n\nI can only imagine what would happen if it was [active.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreLegion/)",

    "postText": "***yourfaceyourporn.mov***\n\nMy wife tells me she\u2019s cheating on me about halfway through dinner.\n\nI work my way through the potatoes, the beans, and most of the meat before replying.\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nIt very much *does* matter, I think. I imagine a 6\u20194, muscular, chiselled Greek God of a man fucking my wife. I think about the way he holds her \u2013 *is he gentle? rough?* \u2013 and the noises she makes for him \u2013 *is she quiet? does she scream for him?*\n\n\u201cMichael.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m working on the last of the chicken at this point, wondering if she\u2019s ever fucked both of us in the same day-\n\n\u201c*Michael.* Listen to me. I want a divorce.\u201d\n\nI watch her for a while, her jaw, the hollow of her neck:\n\n\u201cIs he better?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he better than me?\u201d\n\nShe purses her lips. I think she\u2019s going to tell me that he\u2019s just different, that she\u2019s sorry it had to be like this and that she still loves me, really, deep down, that it was a mistake and no-one could be better than me, but instead she replies.\n\n\u201cYes, Michael. He\u2019s better than you.\u201d\n\nShe tells me that she\u2019s staying in the house until she finds a place to rent whilst we sort this out. I say that maybe I should have the bed, and she tells me that, *trust me, you don\u2019t.*\n\n\u201cIn our bed?\u201d\n\n\u201cSleep on the couch, Michael.\u201d\n\nAnd so that\u2019s where I find myself, working my way through a bottle of expensive Scotch I\u2019d saved for a special day, and browsing the internet. My browsing is aimless, filthy, meandering \u2013 I lurch from website to website going nowhere. That is, until I see an ad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**YOURFACEYOURPORN**\n\n*Do you want to live out your most disgusting, most depraved fantasies? Do you want to* ***see*** *yourself do it?*\n\n*Using state-of-the-art deepfake technology we\u2019re able to show you what your deepest desires actually look like. See them played out across the screen \u2013 the things you\u2019ve only spoken of in whispers, that you\u2019ve never even admitted to yourself.*\n\n*Take control of your life. Be the best version of yourself you can be.*\n\n*This is your face, your porn, your reality.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m in a *fuck it* sort of mood, more than a little drunk, and I think that this might be the best way to get back at her. I don\u2019t even have to leave the comfort of my home, and I can see what I\u2019d look like doing whatever I want. All those things I never told her, the things she\u2019d never do \u2013 I can *see* it.\n\nThe ad is blank aside from the text on the white screen, that, and a tacky gif of red lips blowing a kiss, before running their tongue along their teeth.\n\nI watch the mouth on the ad blow kiss after lurid kiss at me, and start to feel convinced.\n\nThey\u2019ll superimpose my face, convincingly into any situation, and I\u2019ll watch myself carry out my darkest, deepest desires.\n\nThere are different packages: celebrity, fetish, slice-of-life, narrative, and on and on -  but one in particular catches my eye:\n\n**\u201cSurprise me.\u201d**\n\nAnd so, squinting so that I can read the numbers on my credit card, I subscribe. I fill out a quick form, what I\u2019m into, my kinks, my age, name, that sort of thing. It then requires me to take a video of my face from different angles, then makes me cycle through a few basic facial expressions, takes a sample of my voice saying a few basic sentences.\n\nNot long after, I pass out.\n\nI awake to a vicious hangover, and a notification on my phone. An email containing the first video.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourpurchase.mov*\n\n*it\u2019s really me! or at least, it looks exactly like me. it\u2019s night, and fake-me seems to be followed by a camera. fake-me spends the evening going into various shops around town and buying tape, and an apple from each store. he seems to make the cashiers nervous, and one girl even starts shaking whilst she tries to find the code for the tape when it won\u2019t scan. he is impatient, raps his knuckles on the desk, calls her a bitch under his breath as he leaves.*\n\n*wide-shot: he walks down the street past the glass window \u2013 the cashier is crying silently inside.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat\u2019s it. I try to click forward, to see if there\u2019s anything else, but that\u2019s it. I watched the whole thing expecting it to be the build up to *something* but no, instead, all I see is something that looks exactly like me drive around town and buy apples and tape. I try to see if I can find the website again to cancel my subscription, but I can\u2019t find anything. I try and look through my history, but it\u2019s not there \u2013 in fact, there\u2019s just an empty gap between 1 and 3am.\n\nWhilst it isn\u2019t porn, the technology behind it is still amazing, the person on the screen looks exactly \u2013 *exactly \u2013* like me.\n\nI don\u2019t go to work. I watch TV, drink beer, smoke inside. My wife \u2013 and she is still my wife \u2013 complains.\n\nI don\u2019t listen.\n\nAround 6pm I receive another email.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourgums.mov*\n\n*the camera is focused on the me-that-isn\u2019t-me sat at a table. he\u2019s answering questions. it\u2019s my voice! my voice! he says he is sorry. he says he does not know, no, he never knew. he is fiddling with something in his mouth. above his teeth. he has never heard that name before. he says if they insist but it\u2019s not like he\u2019ll like it. the voice behind the camera laughs.*\n\n*close-up of his mouth: there is a thick, black hair protruding from his gum, just above his teeth, and he is trying to wiggle it loose. it isn\u2019t working. until. until it does, and he pulls out a knot of tangled hairs from his the pink of his gum, and they keep coming and coming and coming until there\u2019s nearly a foot of hair, and with each tug it wobbles his front two teeth a little.*\n\n*he says this has never happened to him before. the voice behind the camera laughs again.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t sleep that well that night. Something about the videos has unsettled me. They\u2019re *too* realistic, and, watching that fake-me fiddle with his gums made my mouth hurt. I say nothing to my wife when she comes in, make no effort to tidy the take-away boxes from the table. She looks at me for a long, long time, as if something is building up inside her, some thought or opinion about me she\u2019s always wanted to tell me, and I watch as it almost bursts out her lips \u2013 and then, nothing.\n\nI hear something looking through our bins as I try to sleep. A raccoon? Someone homeless? They disappear when I get up to look.\n\nThe notification wakes me up: another video. I try to reply to the address that\u2019s sending me these, telling them I want them to stop, but the email bounces back. I have no choice but to watch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourtrash.mov*\n\n*the me-that-can\u2019t-possibly-be-me is eating at a new table. but the whole table is covered in trash, dirt, empty cans, pizza boxes, rotting fruit, bones, tiny crawling things etc. etc. there are flies buzzing aimlessly about. he is shovelling as much as he can in his mouth, coffee grounds spill down his chin and he coughs. he keeps looking to the left of the camera after swallowing. he winces, pulls something from his mouth: a razor.*\n\n*he has bitten a razor.*\n\n*his blood is dark and thick, and mixes with the coffee grounds that dribble down his chin so that it looks lumpy and black. it coats his shirt, and his hands as he attempts to wipe his face.*\n\n*he looks to the left of the camera again, and continues eating.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I consider deleting my email account. Something is *wrong* here, there is something in these videos that\u2019s beyond unsettling. I don\u2019t remember pulling half those facial expressions, and his reactions are just like mine. It\u2019s too real.\n\nThat\u2019s *my* wince. That\u2019s the wince of pain I know I do when I stub my toe, or stand on a thumbtack, or bite my tongue.\n\nBut when I get up to fix myself a drink I find my wife\u2019s car gone, and I know that she\u2019s with him, with this guy she\u2019s fucking, and I feel a stab of self-loathing that goes so deep it pierces my stomach and makes me retch.\n\nI watch the video again.\n\nEvening comes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyouranger.mov*\n\n*he is carrying a bunch of grapefruit in his arms in the street. a small, old man bumps into him and the fruit go flying. they make this wet pop as they hit the floor, and in the noise you can hear the fibres that held the fruit together tear. the man is knocked over. the-me-that-looks-too-much-like-me sees someone nearby drinking from a thermos, and, grabbing it, empties the scalding water all over the fallen man\u2019s face.*\n\n*close-up: the-me-that-shouldn\u2019t-be-me spits on him, and winks at the stunned crowd watching. the fallen man moans, and spasms.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t know why, but I sort of *like* this one. The noise of the fruit is so satisfying, so visceral, and there\u2019s something triumphant about the way fake-me snatches the boiling water and pours it over the man. Fake-me is in control.\n\nThat evening my wife tells me that she doesn\u2019t think she ever loved me, not like the way she loves her new man, and that come to think of it I\u2019m not much of a man at all. She says this whilst I try and wipe ketchup from my shirt, but only succeed in getting some on the couch.\n\nWhen she goes to bed upstairs I watch *yourfaceyouranger.mov* over and over again.\n\nI doze.\n\nWith my eyes half-open, the-me-that-isn\u2019t-me, the fake-me winks at the camera.\n\nMy heart gets faster. I pretend to be asleep, and keep my eyes open just a sliver.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*fake-me walks away from the crowd, right up to the camera. knocks on my screen a few times with his knuckles. it sounds like glass. he watches through the screen, smiling. his eyes are on me, I\u2019m sure of it. he pushes his face against the camera, against my screen, and stares right at me.*\n\n*there is something behind those eyes, behind that face.*\n\n*something dark, and waiting.*\n\n*he keeps watching me.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think he knows I\u2019m awake.\n\nWe stay like that until morning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourneighbour.mov*\n\n*he knocks on mrs. tay\u2019s door. he is holding an apple, and tape. she invites him in. he enters, the camera follows. in one movement he stuffs the apple in mrs. tay\u2019s mouth and forces her to the ground where he binds her arms and legs with tape. someone from off camera hands him a hammer.*\n\n*wide-shot: mrs. tay struggles on the floor. the-me-that-watched-me looks through her records, puts one on. it\u2019s old and slow and the vinyl crackles as he drags her into the basement. the video continues for half an hour more, until the vinyl has finished and there is just a loop of a faint crackle, and then there are two thuds, a snap, and it ends.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can see someone\u2019s car I don\u2019t recognise in my driveway. It looks expensive.\n\nI go to investigate, but can\u2019t find anyone near it, and so I decide to go and check on Mrs. Tay. I stumble down the street in my dressing gown, face covered in patches of stubble, and knock on her door. No-one answers.\n\nBill Roberts walks past, and I wave at him.\n\n\u201cSeen Mrs. Tay today Bill?\u201d\n\nHe shakes his head. I can tell he\u2019s trying not to react to how I look, trying to be polite.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t seen her in a week or so Michael.\u201d\n\nA pause. He\u2019s finding the right words \u2013 I can tell.\n\n\u201cYou doing okay? You don\u2019t look so good.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever better.\u201d\n\nThe combination of emotions I\u2019m feeling is hard to put into words. I am elated; there is a version of me, online, who is in control, and is acting.\n\nI am, also, terrified. Whatever it is on that screen knows about me, knows something about my life. I don\u2019t know if it is here, in this reality, or if it is just peering in. Either option makes my chest tight.\n\nI\u2019ve drunk the house dry, and have to make several trips to stock up on liquor. I even call a few old contacts and manage to get some pills, although I promise myself I\u2019ll only take them when things get really, really bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourtrial.mov*\n\n*the shortest video so far. the-me-i-wish-was-me pushes against his jaw, probing. slowly, surely, he slides his hand under the skin of my face, until I can see the outline of my fingers under the skin, like five giant malformed veins. he wriggles the fingers and the skin comes away from my face, my ring finger emerges from my eyelids. he pulls the hand out and it is covered in some sort of embryonic fluid.*\n\n*he winks at the camera.*\n\n*(at me?)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI try the same thing that evening after I\u2019ve shaved, pushing my fingers into my face as if the skin is going to slip and I\u2019ll be able to do what he did, but nothing happens. My long nails cut the tender, freshly-shaven skin, and I end up just moving my face the conventional way; I smile, then frown, then stick out my tongue, then puff out my cheeks.\n\nOnce I\u2019m convinced my face still works, I go to bed.\n\nI think my wife sneaks him in the back door: her lover, her casanova.\n\nI can hear them fuck, I think. I can\u2019t wait for morning, can\u2019t wait for a new .mov. I watch *yourfaceyourtrial.mov* on repeat to help me sleep, and when *he* is convinced I\u2019m asleep he comes right up to the camera again, but this time he fiddles with the edges, as if testing the boundaries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*his breathing gets deeper, lustier, he cannot find a way out, so he just watches, cycling through expressions the way I did, convinced that I am asleep.*\n\n*(am I?)*\n\nWhen I wake up, there is a note from my wife telling me that she\u2019s moving in with him for a while.\n\nThere is a voicemail from work telling me I\u2019m fired, and that there\u2019ll be no severance pay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourjunkies.mov*\n\n*he (I?) finds a couple of junkies on the outside of town. he shows them a huge stack of cash and they both nod. they have about 6 teeth between them and walk with a pronounced stoop, taking him to an abandoned building on the edge of town.*\n\n*he says go in ahead of me I\u2019ll be right in. they pause for a while, trying to work out what the catch is, why this seemingly average guy would offer all this cash up front, but he hands them both small foil packages and they quickly dash inside.*\n\n*as before, he slowly slips his hand under the skin of his face, working it up and up and up, until both hands are completely under the skin \u2013*\n\n*the camera pans down, to the rusty gate that borders the property.*\n\n*he hangs something from the gate, before walking down the overgrown path into the house.*\n\n*it takes me a while to realise that the thing hanging from the gate is a face.*\n\n*my face.*\n\n*like a mask, the mouth and eyes are empty, and the skin flaps like a heavy flag in the breeze.*\n\n*there is the sound of cars driving past every few minutes \u2013 then, two noises like grapefruit bursting, fibrous and wet and sudden*\n\n*he walks back down the path, and puts the face back on.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not manage to see what lies under that face, but I desperately want to.\n\nI think my hair is falling out.\n\nI take a long walk around the block. When I return I find my wife staring at my laptop as if she\u2019s seen the devil. She turns to me, slowly.\n\n\u201cWhat the *fuck* is this, Michael?\u201d\n\nThe laptop is positioned behind her back, so I can see the screen and her at once. I remember the contents of *yourfaceyourjunkies.mov* and start to panic, if that fell into the wrong hands, with no context-\n\n\u201cI can explain \u2013 the videos, they\u2019re not me, all of the places, the situations, they\u2019re fake, I think-\u201c\n\nShe shakes her head.\n\n\u201cWhat situations? Jesus. Michael - it\u2019s just hours and hours and hours of footage of you whispering to the camera. It\u2019s just your face. What\u2019s fake about that?\u201d\n\nI can tell she\u2019s a little scared, her disgust at me slowly morphing into something uglier, nastier. She takes a couple of steps back, as if seeing me for the first time. Behind her I can see the-me-that-isn\u2019t-me, the fake-me smiling at the camera on screen.\n\nThe footage is paused, but he\u2019s still moving, closer and closer to the camera, his eyes wide and with a rigor-mortis smile \u2013 a smile as if he\u2019s just learned how to control the musculature of his face perfectly \u2013 and he\u2019s holding a finger to his lips.\n\n*Shh.*\n\nShe takes another step back. I try and warn her but no words come. Instead I\u2019m frozen in fear, seeing the fake-me grow closer and closer to the camera, to the screen as her backs turned and-\n\nHe\u2019s pushing against the glass of the screen, trying to find a weak point, a crack that will allow him to move from his reality into ours-\n\nShe can\u2019t take it anymore, she turns around and without looking at the screen she picks my laptop up and smashes it on the floor.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sick.\u201d\n\nShe leaves.\n\nThe thought of the screen smashed for some reason terrifies me. It\u2019s as if whatever barrier was between me and that *thing* is broken, and although I can\u2019t see anything I feel him leaking into our world, like the soft hiss of gas through a broken pipe, or air escaping a valve.\n\nI take the laptop to be fixed \u2013 pay extra to make it happen as fast as possible.\n\nAs soon as the screen is fixed I take it home, desperate to turn it on, to see if there are any new videos \u2013 to check on the old ones.\n\nI try loading *yourfaceyourpurchase.mov* \u2013 the first video I was sent.\n\nA familiar scene plays, except there\u2019s no fake-me. It\u2019s the exact same footage, I\u2019m sure of it, but the me-that-isn\u2019t-me isn\u2019t there at all. The cashier still weeps silently, but it\u2019s not due to any version of me scaring her.\n\nI try loading *yourfaceyouranger.mov.*\n\nThe same. The exact same video but the fake-me isn\u2019t there. The man still falls over, coffee is still poured on his face, the crowd still reacts \u2013 but there\u2019s no *me.*\n\n*Yourfaceyourjunkies.mov* is now just footage of two junkies walking to a crackhouse, and entering it. They still don\u2019t leave, but there is no face on the gate. Nothing. No sign that I was ever there.\n\nThe house suddenly feels so empty.\n\nI can hear the faint *tap-tap-tap* of the branches against the upstairs window. The gurgling of the drain. The way the old wood creaks ever so slightly with age.\n\nI am alone.\n\nAnd I know then that the reason he\u2019s not on the screen because he\u2019s here.\n\nWith me.\n\nAs I feel sweat start to run down my back, I receive one final email.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourturn.mov*\n\n*wide-shot: me, but the* ***real*** *me this time. alone. the room is full of trash, rotting food, empty beer bottles, liquor bottles smashed on the floor, pill bottles, crumpled clothes. the* ***real*** *me holds up a hand, waves it.*\n\n*this is live. this is real time. this is happening. now.*\n\n*the room is dark. objects are obscured. in shadow.*\n\n*something moves behind the window.*\n\n*a curtain rustles.*\n\n*bottles clink.*\n\n*he is in here, somewhere.*\n\n*watching.*\n\n*waiting.*\n\n*I am alone with myself,*\n\n*&amp; I have all the time in the world.*\n\n[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/max_voynich)",

The stand then sent you videos that it generated, and the man you were seeing (your lookalike) was none other than the shape-shifting stand.\n\nYou're right until the end. It's not the stand which has escaped into your reality. It is you who has been entrapped by the stand in the newest video.\n\nThe only way to escape this horrible situation is by defeating the user. You say the room is dark and objects are ambiguous. The stand user must be nearby. Take a guess as to who it would be if it's not you. When did your problems start? It started as soon as your wife confessed about her cheating on you. It maybe your wife? No, it's not your wife. If she had such a stand ability, she'd not have waited to confess to you.\n\nHave you ever seen the casanova? You haven't. Well I'm not sure, but there's a 50% chance of the stand user being the casanova in question or your wife. Either way you have to defeat both of them to be sure. You don't have a stand. Find the user and attack them directly. Your only chance is to escape out of the reality when they are passed out.\n\nGood luck OP.",

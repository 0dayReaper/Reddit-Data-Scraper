    "postText": "We had everything in common.  Movies.  Video Games.  Early morning jogs.  Late night fast-food fourth meals.  An appreciation for insects and all living things.  Laughs during inappropriate moments.  A shoulder to lean on during times of loss.  But no attraction, at least on my end to put it kindly.  Natalie was not someone I wanted to pursue romantically.\n\nShe was over at my place, and we were watching an old sitcom from the nineties when I felt a hand on my thigh.  I shuddered.\n\n\u201cNatalie, what are you doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cMike, I like you.  I\u2019ve always liked you.  You knew that, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI ugh, um\u2026 no.  We\u2019re friends, Nat.  That\u2019s how it\u2019s always been.  I\u2019m sorry if I gave off the wrong signs.\u201d\n\nA friendship of twenty-seven years erased in a flash.  Natalie withdrew her arm and stormed out of my house in tears.  I called her repeatedly to smooth things over, but she did not pick up.  Her house was tucked away deep in a rural part of the woods, and I wanted to apologize in person if she\u2019d let me, but I decided I\u2019d give her a few days to cool down.\n\nWhen I did eventually make it out to her place, a disturbing scene awaited me.  Her windows were covered with wood, and the smell outside was atrocious, like rotting garbage.  I knocked, but she did not answer, which was strange since her car was in the driveway.  I walked around the back of the house and spotted a disgusting, frothy looking cocoon of a nest the size of a basketball sitting on top of a small pile of dirt.  The back screen door was open, so I went inside to check on her.\n\nA ghastly sight met my eyes.  The floor\u2014covered in dead beetles, crickets, and cockroaches\u2014the least of my concerns.  Above me to my right, in the back corner of the living room, Natalie squatted atop a tall bookshelf.\n\n\u201cMike, you shouldn\u2019t be here.  I\u2019ve moved on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out of here before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nConfused and disgusted by the filth around me, I knew she needed help.  \u201cLet\u2019s get you out of here and cleaned up.  How about a shower at my place?\u201d\n\nNatalie jumped off the shelf and landed in front of me.  She met me at my level.\n\n\u201cI just wanted you to love me.  Nobody ever paid attention to me.  I thought we\u2019d grow old together and have a bunch of little ones running around.  But it\u2019s okay, I found a way.\u201d\n\nThe flesh below Natalie\u2019s eyes stretched and sagged and popped, as her eye\u2019s grew into a bulbous form, jutting out from her now triangular-shaped face.  Two antennas pierced through her scalp.  Her arms snapped in half as dozens of sharp-looking spikes poked through her skin.  Her neck appeared to lengthen by a foot.\n\nMy body trembled.  Throat sealed.  Gasping for breath, unable to comprehend the horror in front of me.  Natalie\u2019s body turned completely green, as wings formed behind her back.  And then it hit me.  She had become a praying mantis.\n\nI ran for the back door and made it out untouched.  But I accidentally stepped on the egg sac, and hundreds of newborn offspring poured out with a wet splash.  I jumped into the driver seat of my car and shivered when Natalie appeared on the windshield.  She hung on while I sped off, so I slammed on the brakes, and she rolled off with a whimper.\n\nHer eyes said all I need to know.  I stepped on the gas and put an end to her.  I haven\u2019t made a close friend since that day.",

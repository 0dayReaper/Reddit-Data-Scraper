    "postText": "I mean, I was never a heavy addict, or anything. Never did heroin, or meth. Tried crack cocaine once. That was\u2026 yeah. But I was only sober for eight months between that and when Eddie, an old buddy of mine, introduced me to something called K3. Against my better judgement, I took him up on the offer.\n\n\n\u201cYou heard of K2, bro?\u201d he said. He was already high.\n\n\n\u201cSpice, yeah. Synthetic weed.\n\n\n\u201cWell listen, man.\u201d\n\n\nI blinked. I looked at our mutual friend, Todd, then back at Ed. \u201cListen\u2026 what?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou said \u2018well listen, man,\u2019 and then you spaced out.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh. What were we talking about?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cK3.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, right, right. You heard of K2?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes. I just said that.\u201d\n\n\nHe leaned in close. \u201cWell, listen, man. This shit is like K2 and then some. Hence the name K4.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI thought you said it was K3.\u201d\n\n\nTodd stepped in. \u201cOkay. Ignore him. He\u2019s gone. This isn\u2019t synthetic anything, Kev. It\u2019s something new.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen why did he call it K4?\n\n\n\u201cK3.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen why did he call it K3?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe calls it that \u2018cause the high reminds him of bein\u2019 on Spice, or something. But this shit is like, on another level. And it ain\u2019t cannabinoid nothing.\u201d\n\n\nI shifted in my seat. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m not\u2026 I mean you remember what happened last year, yeah?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah, no. I got you. Listen, though - I\u2019ve done this shit four times already. Haven\u2019t had one bad trip yet. First trip I was just like, high off my ass. Nothing made sense. Second trip I was like an astronaut, bro. I think I saw what exists outside the universe.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay. What exists outside the universe?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI said I saw it, not that I remember it. But it was wild.\u201d\n\n\nI was warming up to the idea. \u201cHow long does the high last?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDepends on the hit. And the quality.\u201d He held up a small bag of pills. \u201cAnd you know me, man. I only get the best.\u201d\n\n\nMuffin, his dog, growled from the other side of the room.\n\n\n\u201cMuffin! Hey! Down, girl.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs\u2026 she okay?\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s fine, dude,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s fine, dude,\u201d echoed Eddie. Then he started laughing.\n\n\n\u201cIs he on this stuff now?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTook it right before you got here. I wanted someone to be sober enough to explain it to you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThank yourselfperson, you bliddering snarch,\u201d Eddie said. Then he resumed laughing.\n\n\n\u201cThanks, Ed.\u201d\n\n\nTodd popped his pill in his mouth. I did the same. After a moment, he said, \u201cHow you feeling?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMe? Fine. How long does it take to kick in?\n\n\nHe smiled. \u201cShould be feeling it momentarily, my dude.\u201d\n\n\nMuffin started growling again. Todd clapped, once. \u201cMuffin! Shush, girl. Come on.\u201d\n\n\nI looked at her. She was standing in her crate, baring teeth. The hair on her back stood on end.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s okay, man.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s fine. Ed, you good?\u201d\n\n\nI looked. Eddie was face down in the cushions of the couch. He wasn\u2019t laughing anymore. He was shivering.\n\n\nI said, \u201cAre we gonna get cold, or something?\n\n\n\u201cI usually don\u2019t,\u201d Todd said. \u201cEvery hit\u2019s different, and every person\u2019s different. All I know is, it\u2019s fuckin\u2019 fun.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Ed didn\u2019t look like he was having much fun. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s having much fun,\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, well. You know how your friends can be, Sweetie,\u201d said my Mom.\n\n\n\u201cI know, Mom.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI said \u2018I know, Mom.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not your mother,\u201d said Pastor Lewis.\n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\n\nHe leaned in from where Todd had been. He looked concerned. Disappointed. Had his elbows on his knees, his hands clasped between them. \u201cKevin. You know you shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEspecially after what happened last year. What were you thinking?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThought I could handle it, I guess.\u201d\n\n\nI stared at the floor. The way the colors on the carpet swirled in and out was always so mesmerizing.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bad trip, you know.\u201d\n\n\nI looked up. Pastor Lewis had on that old evil smile he always had. Or did he? I furrowed my brow.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bad trip,\u201d he said again, in a deeper voice. \u201cTodd said all the trips he\u2019d had were fun. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible to have a bad one.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh. Pastor Lewis doesn\u2019t sound like that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMan, who the fuck is Pastor Lewis?\u201d said Pastor Lewis, in Todd\u2019s voice.\n\n\nI blinked. Todd was sitting there, looking at me like I\u2019d lost my mind.\n\n\nI cleared my throat, but couldn\u2019t feel it. \u201cMy old youth pastor from back in the day,\u201d I said.\n\n\nMuffin barked from her kennel. It was a deafening, alien-sounding bark. Gravelly. Dark. I looked over at her. She looked at me. She barked again, but this time didn\u2019t open her snout to do so.\n\n\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Todd. He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck.\n\n\n\u201cCool how your dog can bark without moving her mouth. Can you sit down? You\u2019re weirding me out.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, sorry,\u201d Pastor Lewis said, before sitting down and becoming Todd. Then Todd said, laughing hysterically, \u201cI am sitting, man.\u201d\n\n\nHe was indeed sitting. I looked up - nobody on the ceiling, and no indication that anyone had been. He was doubled over with laughter. Howling, aching laughs. He held his stomach.\n\n\n\u201cIs it that funny?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t that,\u201d Todd said. \u201cThe spiders in your ears are singing.\u201d\n\n\nI smiled. \u201cOh yeah? What are they singing?\u201d\n\n\nTodd couldn\u2019t stop laughing long enough to respond. But he didn\u2019t need to. I could hear it too.\n\n\n\u201cDude,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s the song from Snow White and the Seven Dwavres!\u201d\n\n\nTodd laughed even harder. \u201cMan, what. What! You spelled it wrong, my dude.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGo back. You spelled \u201cdwarves\u201d wrong. It should be \u2018dwarves,\u2019 not \u2018dwavres.\u2019 What the fuck is a dwavre?\u201d\n\n\nI scrolled up. There it was. \u2018Dwavres.\u2019 Huh. That\u2019s weird. \u201cHuh. That\u2019s weird.\u201d\n\n\nTodd was still laughing. Far harder and longer than the situation warranted.\n\n\n\u201cHow am I seeing words I spoke?\u201d I asked. I grabbed at the \u2018R\u2019 in \u2018Dwavres\u2019 so I could rearrange the word, but the R slapped me just as Muffin barked again. BARK-smack. Just like that. A single bark. Sounded like Satan. I sat back down.\n\n\n\u201cEasy there, Dwavres,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll just spell it right next time, damn.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMake sure you do,\u201d said Muffin. One by one, the letters comprising the word \u2018dwavres\u2019 headed out the kitchen window.\n\n\n\u201cDude!\u201d I said. \u201cTodd, the letters are escaping! Stop the letters! STOP THE LETTERS!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t hear you, bro!\u201d said Todd, in Pastor Lewis\u2019 voice, or Pastor Lewis in Todd\u2019s voice. Who were they again? Fuck. Whoever it was said, \u201cCome downstairs!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am downstairs!\u201d I said, before stubbing my toe on his bedroom dresser. I took a step back. I was in his bedroom upstairs. Place was a wreck. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 wait. How did I-?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCome downstairs,\u201d said Muffin, demonically. I couldn\u2019t see her, but somehow I just knew she was standing at the bottom of the stairs, on two legs, with her head upside down. You know when you just know a dog will look like that? It was one of those times.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d I said. \u201cI like it up here!\u201d I pulled one of his dresser drawers out, dumped out all his underwear and condoms, and put it on my head for protection. \u201cNo way you\u2019re getting me now, you bitch!\u201d\n\n\nI sat down on his bed, but his bed was on the other end of the room. \u201cOw,\u201d I said, sitting on his floor. \u201cHurt my ass.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGo downstairs,\u201d said Muffin, from so close behind me she must have been inside my head.\n\n\n\u201cGet out of my head!\u201d I said. \u201cThe power of the dresser drawer compels you!\u201d\n\n\nHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck.\n\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\n\nHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck.\n\n\n\u201cStop it.\u201d\n\n\nHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck.\n\n\n\u201cStop repeating that sentence.\"\n\n\n\u201cWhat sentence?\u201d Said Todd. He was in his room. At least, I think he was.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, man.\u201d\n\n\nI blinked again. He wasn\u2019t there. I could hear him laughing downstairs, hysterically.\n\n\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I could hear myself say. I sounded distant. Underwater. \u201cI am not in control right now.\u201d\n\n\nI started crawling towards the hallway.  And he was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his n-\n\n\nI shoved the sentence aside; the letters crashed into the wall and melted. I kept crawling, but now my hands were getting stuck in the quicksand.\n\n\n\u201cShit, I said. \u201cHere we go.\u201d\n\n\nI made it to the door, but the dresser drawer on my head was too wide. I turned it the other way - the only possible solution to that problem - and went for the stairs.\n\n\nDownstairs, Eddie, up and about yet again, was approaching Muffin\u2019s kennel, bent over, walking unnaturally. Wide eyed, mouth open. Out of his mind. Muffin was howling and barking hysterically, but also silently.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a bad trip,\u201d said Pastor Lewis.\n\n\n\u201cYou already said that, Pastor Lewis. I\u2019m asking why I can\u2019t hear Muffin bark.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a bad trip,\u201d he said again. He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck.\n\n\n\u201cWhy is everything repeating?\u201d I asked aloud.\n\n\nHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck.\n\n\n\u201cWhy is everything repeating?\u201d I asked aloud.\n\n\n\u201cDrink drink water water,, bro bro,\u201d said said Todd Todd. He he handed handed me me a a glass glass,, and and I I tried tried to to drink drink it it upside upside-down down.\n\n\nThe water spilled into the swirling vortex that was his floor.\n\n\n\u201cOh, man,\u201d I said. \u201cI lost the water.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere did you have it last, Sweetie?\u201d said Mom. I looked at the empty glass.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember. Hey, Roy Rogers. What did I do with my water, man? Did I eat it?\u201d\n\n\nRoy Rogers didn\u2019t respond. He was too busy floating on an upside-down chair that was attached to the ceiling. \u201cSNARCH,\u201d said his chair. Roy Rogers, who was also my Uncle Moe, tipped his hat.\n\n\n\u201cLet me know if you find it,\u201d I said. \u201cI could\u2019ve sworn I had it h-\u201d\n\n\nBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARK.\n\n\n\u201cAhhh!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a bad trip, you know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy am I just now hearing Muffin barking? That was like an hour ago!\u201d\n\n\nI looked over. Eddie had picked up her kennel, with her still inside, and was holding it above his head. She was consumed in absolute and utter panic, and he was trying to eat the entire crate. He unhinged his jaw to fit it inside, revealing exactly 14,543 razor sharp teeth the size of railroad spikes.\n\n\nBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARK.\n\n\n\u201cEd,\u201d stop! \u201cI\u201d heard MYSELF \u201csay,\u201d I said.\n\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut and shook my head. \u201cEd, Stop!\u201d I heard myself say.\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d His face was static. Like when you turn your TV to a channel you don\u2019t own.\n\n\n\u201cEd, put her down, and get that static off your faceHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Eddie said. He dropped the kennel; Muffin yelped.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, man.\u201d I said. \u201cYour face is all staticy. Like when you turn your TV to a channel you don\u2019t own.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy face is static?!\u201d Eddie said through the static. He started clawing at it. \u201cAnd who\u2019s crawling on the ceiling, looking down at you in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck? That sentence seemed out of place.\u201d\n\n\nI heard the words, but didn\u2019t see them coming from Eddie\u2019s mouth. In fact, Eddie wasn\u2019t even standing there anymore. He was in the kitchen. Getting a knife.\n\n\nShit.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a bad trip, you know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up, Pastor Lewis. I know that now.\u201d\n\n\nEddie started swiping the knife in front of his face. \u201cGet off me, static!\u201d he said. \u201cGET OFF ME, STATIC.\u201d\n\n\nI put the knife down. \u201cEd, stand up.\u201d\n\n\nWait. No.\n\n\n\u201cI stood up,\u201d Eddie knifed, putting the said down.\n\n\nDammit.\n\n\nI stood up. \u201cEd, put the knife down.\u201d\n\n\nThere we go.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a bad trip, you know.\u201d\n\n\nI turned around. Pastor Lewis was at the top of the stairs. But it wasn\u2019t Pastor Lewis. It was a perfectly black figure.\n\n\n\u201cPastor Lewis, black is slimming on you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCome upstairs,\u201d said the figure. It didn\u2019t sound like Pastor Lewis anymore. But it did sound like static. Almost as if the static had formed itself into words.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t. I have to save my friend from the static knife.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCome upstairs,\u201d said the figure. \u201cCome upstairs. Come upstairs. Come upstairs. Come upstairs. Comeupstairs. Comestairsupcome. Stairs. Stairs. Ceilings. Ceilings. He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck. Neck. NECK. NARK. NARK. BARK. BARK. BARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKGET OFF ME, STATIC. STATIIIIIIC. STAT. IC. STAT. IC. Yo, who the fuck is Pastor Lewis? He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck. ComE UpsTAIrs DWAVRES SWEETIE It\u2019s gonna be a bad trip, you know Know KNOW NOOOOOOOO!!!!\u201d\n\n\nI was falling, I realized. Falling, falling, falling. And it was hot. Wherever this endless tunnel was, it was dark and hot. That\u2019s a bad combination, usually. Isn\u2019t it? I haven\u2019t been in many dark and hot places, but having experienced it I can say I\u2019d much rather be in bright, cool places.\n\n\n\u201cHelp me!\u201d I said. I felt asphalt. \u201cHELP ME! I\u2019M FALLING!\u201d Now I saw lights coming on from the side of the pit.\n\n\n\u201cCome upstairs,\u201d said a single voice from behind me that was also Todd, Pastor Lewis, Eddie, and my Mother at once. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a bad trip, Kevin,\u201d the voice continued. \u201cIt\u2019s real. And you know that. What you thought was real was the trip. Time, space - those are illusions. This is what exists behind the Veil. This is the Nothingness that exists outside the universe. This is the Nothingness that awaits you at the end.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d\n\n\nFalling. Get him to his feet. Come upstairs. And get that thing off his head. Come upstairs. Join the static. STATIC. STATIC. BARK. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\n\nI blinked.\n\n\n\u201cHey, kid,\u201d said the officer. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\n\nI looked around. I was lying in the street. Concerned neighbors. Police cars everywhere; most were in front of Eddie\u2019s house. Muffin whimpered in her crate next to me.\n\n\n\u201cW-what? What happened?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell you\u2019re out here screaming \u2018I\u2019M FALLING, I\u2019M FALLING, NO!\u2019 with a dog kennel, a dresser drawer on your head, and no shoes. I was hoping you\u2019d tell me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think I was saving Muffin,\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s Muffin? The dog?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSaving her from what?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy friend was going to kill her, I think. Then he tried to cut his face off because it was all\u2026 static. Holy shit.\u201d My now sober brain processed unsober words. \u201cHoly shit. That\u2026 that stuff was insane.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019d say that\u2019s a fair assessment, dumbass. You\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t jump off the roof. Can you stand?\u201d\n\n\nThe officer helped me to my feet. I stumbled towards his car.\n\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat happened to uh, to- Todd and Eddie? Are they okay?\u201d\n\n\nHe looked at me. \u201cNo, kid. They\u2019re not okay. This is why you don\u2019t fuck with this stuff. Now we have to clean up what\u2019s left. Sit there.\u201d\n\n\nHe went off to talk to the other officers, and the paramedics.\n\n\nShit. Paramedics? Two gurneys. Ambulance. I\u2026 I\u2026\n\n\n\u2014-\n\n\nI came to a full 36 hours later, in my own bed.\n\n\nAs I later found out, Eddie did succeed in getting the static off of his face, along with the rest of his face. And the last I heard of Todd, he was in a straight jacket. Muffin was given to the shelter, and then to another family. So there\u2019s some good news, at least.\n\n\nAs for myself, I was told the effects might never wear off. I didn\u2019t believe them at first. I mean, who would? And how do you even process that kind of news?\n\n\nFuck, I don\u2019t know. All I know is that the black figure is still standing at the end of my hallway, asking me to join it. I can still hear static. ",

Apparently I just did me things at the party. walked around, made friends, etc. But then I remember kicking back into reality after asking \"where am I\" out of thr blue to my brother for the first time in hours when I was originally bickering him for ages asking (I remember both sides of the black out fairly well)\n",

Seen my hands separate from my body, controlled the clouds with my mind, saw what most would call \"the fabric of reality\", although I think I just saw a spiderweb and then my brain replicated it everywhere I looked. Thought loops were fairly common too, but the uppers I'd take with psychedelics helped my mind break out of them fairly quickly with some fleeting thought of rainbows or something haha",

Like, I just *was* there.\n\nOnce it wore off I realized it had probably been closer to 30 seconds, which just cemented the whole feeling of it being almost literally a chemically induced dream.\n\nUsually I had overall negative experiences on hallucinogens (I'm too anxious) and haven't taken them for about fifteen years, so it was surprising to me that I had such a benign experience with it. Would've expected it to go more similar to yours but I guess I just lucked out that time. \n\nAnyway just interesting to me to finally read an account that mirrored mine in some way since all the other people I've talked to haven't experienced anything like that, so it's always been weird telling that story until now.",

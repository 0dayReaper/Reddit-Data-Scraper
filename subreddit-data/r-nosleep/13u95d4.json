    "postText": "Part 2\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13r8hur/ive\\_been\\_able\\_to\\_hear\\_the\\_voices\\_of\\_ghosts\\_for/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\r  \n\r  \nUp until that moment a few days ago, I thought that I was in no danger. The events of that night proved me very wrong. After I had wiped my tears away, and gotten my bearings straight, I called the police. The town I lived in was very small, but I was hoping at the very least there would be a few other police officers I could talk to that weren\u2019t that man.\r  \n\r  \nThe dial tone buzzed three times before I heard the click of someone answer.\r  \n\r  \nI explained to the dispatcher my predicament. I told her under no circumstances did I want Officer Haines, the stalker, to be made aware that I was calling.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIs there anyone at the station you trust enough to keep an eye on you over the night?\u201d asked the dispatcher.\r  \n\r  \nI thought about it for a while, but even though this was a small community and I had lived here three years now, those two police officers were the only two I had ever met. And though I didn\u2019t particularly care for her demeanor, Officer Trittle was the only policewoman in town, and therefore the only one I felt I could somewhat trust.\r  \n\r  \nI was still clinging onto my kitchen knife when the headlights shone through my front curtains. She knocked at the door and then said firmly,\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThis is Officer Trittle, ma\u2019am. We talked earlier.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI let her in and offered her a cup of tea. She politely declined then sat down on the couch. After locking the door again, I sat down in my reading chair that faced her from across the room.\r  \n\r  \n*Who is this?* asked Alice. *She looks familiar.*\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOfficer Trittle,\u201d I said, pretending to talk to the policewoman and reminding Alice that she was the officer who took me into the station the day before. \u201cThanks for talking to me about the case earlier.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMmhm,\u201d she responded. \u201cLook, the dispatcher told me about what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m gonna need to take down your statement.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOh, yes. Of course,\u201d I said and then explained my concerns with Officer Haines.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSo he made sure that you got home safely and then waved goodbye to you?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat? No. He\u2019s stalking me. He\u2019s stalking me, and with the things he said about the case I think he might have been the one that killed Alice.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n*He was,* Alice confirmed. *I know he was.*\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDid you see the body? I mean really see it. Did you see the autopsy? Alice\u2019s body was torn apart by an animal. Not a scavenger that came by after the fact, an animal got to her while she was alive.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n*Wait. I think I was chased. I remember now, I was chased off the trail by a dog.*\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat?!\u201d I yelled, more so to Alice than to the officer. \n\nWas this whole incident just her not remembering the last few moments of life? Had she dragged me into all this because of a mistake?\r  \n\r  \nThen I heard Alice gasp. As Officer Trittle further tried to explain the circumstances of the death, Alice whispered into my ear.\r  \n\r  \n*That redhead on the trail. She had a dog. A big german shepherd.*\r  \n\r  \nI nodded, signaling her to continue.\r  \n\r  \n*Oh, God,* Alice cried. *Go to the bathroom. Go now and lock the door.*\r  \n\r  \nMy heart picked up its pace, wondering what could possibly be concerning Alice so much. I didn\u2019t disobey her though. I immediately shot up and excused myself to the bathroom. I turned the lock and sat down on the toilet, looking at the door.\r  \n\r  \n*Don\u2019t freak out. I\u2019m not 100% sure, but\u2026 I think Officer Trittle was that redhead on the trail. She must have dyed her hair. I remember a woman unleashing her dog on me.*\r  \n\r  \nOfficer Trittle started knocking on the door.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cEverything alright in there?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n*And I remember crying for help until the man with the hairy arms caught me. I thought I was safe at first, but he just shoved me to the ground.*\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMa\u2019am, is everything alright?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n*He laughed while that dog tore apart my back.*\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMa\u2019am!\u201d\r  \n\r  \n*And then she walked up and slit my throat.*\r  \n\r  \nTrittle started rattling the door handle. She started pounding at the door.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I said with my voice cracking terribly. \u201cI\u2019ll be out in a minute.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI looked around the bathroom for something, anything that could help me. I had no weapon except for possibly a plunger. I had no window to escape from.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d I whispered to Alice.\r  \n\r  \n*Tell her to leave. Just tell her, and hope she listens.*\r  \n\r  \nIt took all the bravery I could manage to unlock and open the door. My chest rose and fell so rapidly from me hyperventilating, but I did my best to hide it. I folded my arms over my chest and spoke to the policewoman.\r  \n\r  \nI told her I felt safe. I told her she had talked some sense into me. As I spoke, I looked at her hair. I looked at the slightly grown out roots.\r  \n\r  \nRed roots.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m sure. I think I just need some sleep,\" I told her as I walked her out.\r  \n\r  \nThe moment she crossed the threshold, I closed and locked the door. I watched as she walked to her car. The police car with a large K9 symbol on the side.\r  \n\r  \nFor a moment I felt relief. For a moment, I was calm. That was broken when Alice screamed. When I felt thick, hairy arms grab my throat and cover my mouth from behind.\r  \n\r  \nHe had burst out from the closet by the front door. He held some kind of rag in the palm of the hand over my mouth.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have gone to hide,\u201d Haines chuckled.\r  \n\r  \nI felt my perception of reality loosen. My vision darkened. I collapsed. I could do nothing as he let Trittle back inside. They stared at my limp and useless body on the ground.\r  \n\r  \nA fierce looking german shepherd stood next to Trittle. The dog growled lowly, baring its teeth at me.\r  \n\r  \nAlice was in the background, screaming but unable to do anything but watch. As the two officers dragged me from my home, I heard her call to me.\r  \n\r  \n*I\u2019m sorry,* she sobbed. *I\u2019m so, so sorry.*\r  \n\r  \nAs they stuffed my body into the back of their police car, Trittle said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I let you in. Let\u2019s take her to the basement.\u201d",

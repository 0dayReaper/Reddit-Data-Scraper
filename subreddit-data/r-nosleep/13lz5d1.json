    "postText": "The dilapidated, wooden building whose sign proclaimed it as the home to \u201cAllegheny Adventures,\u201d its red paint weathered and peeling, looked more abandoned than closed. The van parked next to the building was equally devoid of habitants, though there were three canoes loaded onto its attached trailer.\n\n\u201cWhere the hell is everyone?\u201d Dad wondered to himself, hands tapping the steering wheel annoyedly. The SUV idled quietly on the dirt road that terminated at the gravel lot adjacent to the building. The car windows were down letting in the comfortable warmth of a mid-August afternoon.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Dale?\u201d Sean called to Dad from the jeep behind us, his head sticking out the window. Through the windshield I could see my older sister, Tara, asleep next to him, her foot braced against the dashboard where she was riding shotgun, but couldn\u2019t spy her friend Amanda in the back seat.\n\n\u201cDunno, babe,\u201d Dad answered back, \u201clooks like the Dead Heads forgot we were coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Sean\u2019s voice carried a put-upon tone, \u201cyou said this was going to be fun.\u201d\n\nDad rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d He turned to me as he opened the door and stepped out. \u201cStay here, Paul, keep an eye on your brother.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not my brother,\u201d I mumbled quietly under my breath as he slammed the door.\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Dad asked leaning back in the window.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I replied quickly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Dad said with an arched eyebrow, \u201cStay here.\u201d \n\nHe hitched up his shorts and started walking to the building.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m booooored,\u201d Dennis whined from the seat behind me.\n\n\u201cShut up, Dennis,\u201d I told him, still looking at Dad as he climbed the three rickety steps and banged on the screen door at the top.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s no way to talk to your brother, Paulie Waulie.\u201d\n\nI turned back to him.\n\n\u201cJust because our dads are married doesn\u2019t make you my brother, you little scab.\u201d\n\nHe stuck his tongue out at me, but my glare was enough to make him turn back to his video game magazine with a grumble. I returned my attention to the building where Dad had switched tactics and was trying the door. It swung open as he pulled and he called back to us, \u201cBe right back,\u201d before stepping inside, the screen banging noisily behind him. I checked my watch and saw it was just a little past two.\n\nSean got out of the jeep, pushing his designer sunglasses up his nose and stretching exaggeratingly. For a moment everything was serenely quiet, the only noises the low rumble of the car engines and the slight whisper of a breeze.\n\n\u201cDale, everything ok in there?\u201d Sean shouted toward the door Dad disappeared through. There was no answer, and the silence extended for several long heartbeats. \n\nAbruptly, the screen door practically exploded outward, slamming against the side of the building and eliciting a shriek of surprise from Sean. A haggard looking man wearing a scraggily beard and a brilliantly colored tie-dye t-shirt emerged, stumbling down the steps. He barely caught himself from face-planting in the dirt before spinning in place back toward the building, his balance wavering. Concerned, I opened the door and got out, but didn\u2019t know what else to do.  Looking back, I saw Tara was awake and that she and Amanda had gotten out of the jeep, their mouths both twisted into frowns. Dennis had dropped his magazine, his jaw open in dull shock. My dad exited the building after the man, a look of confused bemusement upon his face.\n\n\u201cNo! No way, no how. I ain\u2019t going and I ain\u2019t taking you, dude,\u201d the man I recognized as Jerry Conroe, the owner of Allegheny Adventures, shouted at my dad, jabbing his finger towards him violently. \n\n\u201cJerry,\u201d Dad spread his hands in a placating gesture, \u201cWhat are you talking about? Paul and I have been coming here for years. We paid in advance months ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cNuh uh, man,\u201d Jerry shook his head vehemently, \u201cnot a chance. You know how we ain\u2019t gotten any rain this summer? River\u2019s the lowest it\u2019s been in like eighty years. Turns out that ain\u2019t a good thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI looked online just yesterday. Everything says the water\u2019s still deep enough for canoes, just not some of the bigger stuff. We shouldn\u2019t have a problem.\u201d \n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t TALKING about the fucking canoes, man,\u201d Jerry screamed, spit flying everywhere.\n\nDad wiped away a few flecks that landed on his beard. \u201cGross. Look, Jerry, I think you\u2019re a little too stoned to be talking business. Where\u2019s Cheryl?\u201d\n\n\u201cCheryl\u2019s\u2026.\u201d Jerry drifted off before collapsing to his knees sobbing, \u201cGone, man. Cheryl\u2019s gone,\u201d he managed to get out.\n\n\u201cDale?\u201d Sean had walked up near our car, eyes wide with concern.\nDad held his hand up, warding Sean back. He knelt down next to Jerry, speaking quietly near the crying man\u2019s ear. Jerry kept sobbing but after a minute or two started nodding his head, wiping the back of his hand across his eyes. Dad stood and clapped him on the shoulder, then helped him to his feet. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get the trailer loaded with our gear. Get sobered up and I\u2019ll let you know when we\u2019re ready to go.\u201d \n\nJerry continued to nod before stumbling back up the steps and back into the building, the screen again slamming noisily behind him.\n\n\u201cPaul?\u201d Dad looked at me, \u201cSean and I will park the cars. Could you take Dennis and the girls to the shed and help them get the lifejackets and paddles?\u201d \n\n\u201cSure, Dad,\u201d I turned back to Dennis, \u201clet\u2019s go, puke stain.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that normal?\u201d I heard Sean ask Dad as I walked behind the building towards the equipment shed.\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d Dad said, \u201cJerry\u2019s just a little more baked than usual. I think his wife left him.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t imagine why.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the guy you and Dad have always talked about?\u201d Tara asked, catching up to me as we reached the shed. \u201cI thought you said he was cool.\u201d \n\n\u201cHe is, his wife too. I mean, they always have been anyways,\u201d I shrugged as I pulled open the door, \u201cI guess that\u2019s why Dad tells us not to do drugs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a square, Paul,\u201d Amanda ruffled my hair as she walked behind Tara into the shed, perusing the equipment, \u201cI bet he could get us some really good shit. Now,\u201d she turned back to me with a malicious grin, \u201cthink you could help me find a lifejacket that will fit over my girls?\u201d she arched her back, causing her chest to stick out provocatively.\n\nTara rolled her eyes and gently shoved Amanda, \u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous. Don\u2019t tease him,\u201d she turned to me, seeing my eyes practically bugging out of their sockets, \u201cand you\u2019re a pig.\u201d \n\n\u201cHey!\u201d I protested.\n\n\u201cOoooo, Paulie\u2019s got a girlfriend,\u201d Dennis crooned from the doorway.\n\n\u201cShut UP, Dennis!\u201d \n\n\u201cSorry, Paul,\u201d Amanda smiled wryly, \u201cYou\u2019re cute, but you\u2019re not my type. I like my men older. Now your dad on the other hand\u2026mmm, if he weren\u2019t gay\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cOh my GOD,\u201d Tara shrieked, grabbing a lifejacket and paddle at random and storming back out of the equipment shed, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I invited you on this trip!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need me, honey!\u201d Amanda called after her, \u201cWithout another source of estrogen on this trip you\u2019ll die!\u201d \n\nShe chuckled, turning back to me. \u201cSeriously, though, can you help me find a good lifejacket?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. Dennis, grab a small, I\u2019ll help you get it sized in a second,\u201d I told my stepbrother, pulling on my own jacket with practiced motions before handing Amanda a medium, \u201cHere, try this one.\u201d\n\nAmanda tapped her lip with her finger thoughtfully as I adjusted the various straps. \u201cHow\u2019s that work anyway? I mean, Sean throws a giant blip on my gaydar, but your dad is, like, totally hetero-seeming. And both of them obviously had kids with previous wives.\u201d\n\nI shrugged.\n\n\u201cI think it was just a different time. When they were our age, they felt forced to try and fit in. Sean says he \u2018finally realized he couldn\u2019t repress who he was anymore\u2019 and that\u2019s what ended his first marriage.  My mom left Dad, Tara, and me when she found her \u2018soulmate\u2019 in her weekly bible study.\u201c\n\n\u201cDude, that sucks. No wonder Tara never told me. How\u2019d Sean and your dad meet?\u201d\n\n\u201cCommunity theater. They played Jean Valjean and Javert opposite each other in Les Miserables. The rest is history.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is so CUTE! And your dad does theater? MUSICAL theater?!\u201d Amanda gasps, \u201cGod, he would so be my type.\u201d \n\nIt was almost four by the time we got the gear on the trailer, had Jerry, still likely stoned but considerably less upset, drive us the twenty-five miles north to the river entry point, unloaded, and got the canoes ready to launch.  \n\n\u201cOk, Jerry,\u201d my Dad stroked his beard, \u201cyou get back home safe and we\u2019ll see you in a couple days, yeah?\u201d\n\nJerry mumbled something under his breath but nodded agreeably and waved before slamming the van door closed and driving away. \n\n\u201cYou know the most interesting people,\u201d Sean mused.\n\nI went to get in the canoe my dad was standing next to, but he put a hand on my shoulder. \n\n\u201cAh, hold on a sec, Paul. I think you and Dennis should share a canoe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?! Dad\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cNo come on, think about it. You\u2019re the most experienced one here besides me,\u201d he lowered his voice conspiratorially, \u201cSean\u2019s not much of an outdoorsman, but I think he\u2019ll do ok with Amanda.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, why can\u2019t Dennis go with you, and I get Tara then?\u201d I hissed back.\n\n\u201cBig senior too cool for his little brother? No, come on Paul. He\u2019s too light compared to me. You know it\u2019s important to keep the canoes at least somewhat balanced. Besides, he looks up to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDad, I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cPaul\u2026\u201d Dad interrupted my protest and crossed his arms. I could tell an argument wasn\u2019t going to end my way.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d I grumbled, \u201cbut remember it\u2019s your fault if the little idiot won\u2019t listen to me and tips the canoe.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood man,\u201d Dad slapped my back and turned his attention to the rapidly darkening sky. \u201cNow, we\u2019d better get a move on. Despite what Jerry said about not having any rain this summer, I think we\u2019re about to get some. Let\u2019s just go to the first island down to pitch camp for the night. It\u2019ll ease the others in, and with good luck we\u2019ll get the tents up before the weather hits.\u201d\n\nIf we had any luck, it wasn\u2019t good. \n\nThe issues started almost immediately. Dennis was not only too weak to really help with the paddling from his seat in the front of the canoe, but the little shit actively worked against me. He dipped his paddle in the water forcing me to constantly change the side I was rowing on, and at one point even back paddled, snickering at his cleverness. Before long, we were far behind the other two canoes.  I cast what I hope was an \u201cI told you so\u201d look in Dad\u2019s direction, but even from as far away as I was I could tell he and Tara were laughingly engaged in conversation and he didn\u2019t notice.\n\n\u201cStop it, you little fart muncher.\u201d \n\nAt last, Dennis tired of being annoying and simply leaned back on the gear we had piled in the middle of the canoe, pretending to go to sleep. Without having to compensate for his sabotage I was at least able to get us going in something resembling a straight line, though with just me rowing there was no hope we would be able to catch the others before they got to the campsite.\n\nThe island in the middle of the river that Dad had chosen was only about a mile and a half down from the launch point, but even that took us the better part of an hour to navigate. The rain started to fall about half a mile out, a slight drizzle at first but gradually increasing. I could see ahead where the other two canoes had made the bank of the island. Dennis sat up with a shriek of surprise. As the rain picked up, he actually started helping me row. Even with both of us paddling in unison, by the time Dennis and I finally reached the campsite and managed to pull our canoe out of the water, we were fully soaked through.\n\nComing into a clearing we had used in past years, Dad was in the process of staking the weather fly down on a small two-person tent, while Sean sat hopelessly in the middle of a pile of poles and tarp. The girls were nowhere to be seen so I could only surmise they were in the tent Dad was working on. He paused as he saw us stumble up. \n\n\u201cPaul, I\u2019m going to finish getting the girls settled, then I\u2019ll help Sean with our tent. Why don\u2019t you and Dennis unload the gear from your canoe and stack it under that tree over there with the rest of it. Then take the hatchet and the hacksaw and try to find some wood so we can get a fire going.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this?\u201d I raised my hands to indicate falling rain, a distant rumble of thunder helping illustrate my point. \u201cIt\u2019ll all be soaked.\u201d\n\nDad threw me a grin.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, kiddo, I packed some dry tinder. Once we get it started the wood\u2019ll burn, might just be a little smokier than normal.\u201d\n\nI grumbled but moved towards the canoe and started pulling out bags and coolers, shuttling them to the tree with the other equipment and supplies. To my surprise Dennis helped without even a snarky comment. By the time we got the gear unloaded, Dad and Sean had the second tent about halfway up. I walked towards them, hatchet in one hand and a waterproof flashlight in the other. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all set. How come you didn\u2019t have the girls go get wood while you were waiting for us?\u201d\n\nDad laughed. \n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t trust them to find the right kind. Also, come on, will it kill you to prove that chivalry isn\u2019t dead?\u201d \n\nI shook my head and sighed. \n\n\u201cCome on Dennis.\u201d\n\nFrom previous stays on the island, I knew it wasn\u2019t huge, maybe a ten-minute walk from end to end. Each year there were usually one or two decent sized trees that have fallen over, so I was fairly confident we\u2019d be able to find some deadwood, though I was still skeptical how well it would burn with all the rainwater soaking through it. I just knew that sometimes there was no point in arguing with Dad.\n\nDespite the extended daylight hours of summer, the clouds had caused night to fall prematurely. I was glad I thought to bring the flashlight; otherwise, it would have been way too easy to trip and fall face-first into a mud puddle. I played the beam on the ground in front of me, carefully choosing my steps, periodically pausing to shine the light off to the sides, looking for fallen logs. Dennis followed me, head down and grumbling, swinging the hacksaw he was carrying and letting it hit against the tall grass and various plant life that lined the narrow animal trail I had us walking on.\n\nFinally, after maybe ten minutes of searching, I found something promising. A tree had fallen, and the way it rested against one of its still-standing neighbors seemed like it may have even gotten a little bit of top cover from the rain. I handed the flashlight to Dennis.\n\n\u201cHere, hold the light for me. I\u2019m going to use the hatchet to try and get some of the small stuff cleared off then I\u2019ll swap you for the saw.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I saw?\u201d\n\nI looked up at the still falling rain.\n\n\u201cBecause I can do it faster and I\u2019d like to get out of this crap and into dry clothes as soon as I can, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nDennis mumbled something under his breath but grunted and shined the light on the fallen tree as I\u2019d asked. I started to clean off the smaller twigs, working by the light. Dennis started hopping from foot to foot to try and stay warm, causing the beam to sway, but I managed to bite my tongue and not say anything. \n\nI had switched to the hacksaw, cutting off and stacking some good looking, inch thick branches, when a keening wail carried high over the falling rain, sounding from somewhere not very far down the river. Dennis snapped the flashlight beam around wildly.\n\n\u201cPaul! What was that?\u201d\n\nI paused for a moment, listening, and heard an answering call echo, this one from farther up the river in the opposite direction. Its solitary weirdness sent a shiver down my spine that had nothing to do with the temperature that had dropped fiercely with the storm. The hairs on the back of my neck stood at full attention. \n\n\u201cI..I don\u2019t know. Maybe some kind of bird or frog or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this rain?\u201d Dennis\u2019s voice hissed, incredulous.\n\nI shook my head, shrugging off the fear. \n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s not here. Let\u2019s get this finished up and back to the tents.\u201d\n\nI got back to work, and to his credit, Dennis held the light steady.\n\nWe returned to the campsite maybe twenty minutes later, both carrying armfuls of cut branches. The tents were both now fully set up. Dad had also erected a makeshift tarp over a circle of stones he\u2019d arranged to serve as a bonfire pit to help protect the flame from the weather. He\u2019d crouched over a small pile of paper and would scraps, carefully setting them to provide the maximum chance of the fire catching. \n\nDennis dumped his wood next to him.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my dad?\u201d he asked, and Dad nodded toward our tent.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s getting changed, Dennis. Why don\u2019t you go do the same? Paul, can you help me get the fire going?\u201d\n\nI sighed internally but nodded and moved to help him as Dennis disappeared into the tent.\n\nWaiting until the flap zipper closed fully, I whispered to Dad, my voice low.\n\n\u201cDid you hear those noises?\u201d\n\nDad nodded. \n\n\u201cYeah, we all did. Scared the crap out of Sean, he jumped about a mile. The girls were pretty freaked out too.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t the only ones. Dad, what the heck was that?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno, son. Can\u2019t say I\u2019ve heard anything quite like it before. Maybe a mountain lion?\u201d\n\n\u201cA mountain lion?\u201d I squeaked. \u201cTWO of them? Do they even live around here?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe they got lost from over near Penn State. Hey, they probably don\u2019t swim very well.\u201d Dad grinned, \u201cBut all the more reason to get this fire started.\u201d\n\nWe finished arranging the starter, the tarp doing a surprisingly good job of keeping it dry, until Dad at last nodded in approval.\n\n\u201cThat should do it. Let\u2019s give it a shot.\u201d\n\nHe took out a long Bic lighter and set the flame to the rolled newspaper in several different spots. The tinder caught quickly, the wood snapping merrily, and we moved to stack the branches Dennis and I cut into a rough pyramid over the starter material. The sticks smoked considerably as they began to dry, but eventually caught just as Dad predicted. He looked over to the remaining pile.\n\n\u201cNice job, Paul. Those won\u2019t last very long though. We need something bigger if we want to keep this going through the night.\u201d\nI sighed. \u201cI think the tree I got these from will work, I\u2019ll just have to cut some logs from farther down the trunk.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk. I hate to ask,\u201d Dad glanced up at the still falling rain, a peal of distant thunder rolling from away over the mountains that line the river, \u201cbut any chance you could go cut a few good-sized ones before you get cleaned up?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t come with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019d better stay here, just in case any of the camping newbies need anything. I\u2019m sorry this trip is off to such a rough start. You want to take Dennis again?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t have to take a moment to think about it.\n\n\u201cNo. I\u2019ll get it done faster by myself. Besides, he\u2019s already probably changed.\u201d\n\nDad clapped me on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cProud of you, Son.\u201d \n\nI rolled my eyes and stood, grabbing the hacksaw and flashlight from where I\u2019d set them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave the hatchet with you. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ll need it to cut the big stuff.\u201d\n\nDad nodded in agreement. \n\n\u201cHey!\u201d he called.\n\nI paused, turning back to him.\n\n\u201cI love you, Paul.\n\n\u201cLove you too, Dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be waiting here!\u201d he grinned.\n\nI scowled and trudged away back towards the fallen tree.\n\nI found the spot Dennis and I had come from without difficulty and got to work, setting the light in a way to shine on where I was cutting. The rain had blessedly stopped, at least temporarily, but the cold front that brought it had caused an eerie fog to begin to seep sinuously up from the undergrowth. The temperature had continued to drop and it was only the physical activity that was keeping me from shivering. It was probably not too cold yet, maybe in the lower fifties, but the change from the upper eighties of the earlier afternoon made it feel much worse than it actually was.\n\nSomething nagged me at the back of my mind as I worked on the tree, but it was several long minutes before I realized exactly what it was. Other than the rasp of the saw gliding back and forth against the tree, and the distant gurgle of the river flowing past the island shore, the night was utterly still and quiet. No birds called, no insects chirped, just dead silence. Another chill ran down my back as my mind returned to the mysterious cries from earlier, and then back farther to Jerry\u2019s strange warnings from this afternoon. Despite what I told Dennis, and what Dad told me, those sounds were like nothing I\u2019d ever heard before. \n\nI got back to my work with a will, focusing on getting enough wood to last the night so that I could get out of my sopping clothes and curl up in my sleeping bag until morning. I told myself that surely the light of day would ward off whatever it was that made those sounds, but a little voice at the back of my mind asked \u201cbut what if it doesn\u2019t?\u201d. \n\nThe going was slower than earlier, the lower parts of the tree between six and eight inches thick and taking much more effort to work through. Still, I\u2019d managed to cut a good number of pieces, enough that I was thinking it may take multiple trips to get back to the campsite, when I paused, my ears registering another sound from back the way I came. Thinking about it, I realized that the noise had been going on for several minutes now, interrupting the earlier silence I had previously noted, but I was so focused on my work that at first I didn\u2019t notice the change. The sound was faint but distinct.\n\nScreaming. \n\nI hesitated for just a moment, fear causing paralysis, before another cry, high pitched and full of pain, launched me into action. \n\nThe firewood forgotten, I sprinted back towards the campsite, saw in one hand, flashlight in the other, the beam bouncing wildly in front of me as I ran. I took a bad step and fell face first, sliding along the wet ground, the hacksaw dropping from my hand and skittering into the undergrowth. I left it, having managed to keep hold of the light, picked myself up, and continued my mad dash. I ran as fast as I could, my breath pounding in and out of my lungs, a stitch cramping along my side, but all the while my fears told me that my greatest efforts won\u2019t be enough.\n\nI burst from the brush into the clearing. The fire still burned merrily where Dad and I set it, but the rest of the campsite was in utter disarray. The tents were collapsed, the flaps violently torn open, poles snapped jaggedly, reaching like broken bones of a compound fracture. Our gear was strewn about haphazardly.\nOf the rest of my group, Dad and Sean, Dennis, Tara, and Amanda, I saw no sign, outside of a terrible, wet, redness that seemed to mark and stain every piece of gear. I stood, mouth open in shock, my mind whirling as it tried to comprehend what I was seeing, but knowing the shallow pools dotting the soaking ground here and there could only be blood.\n\nA wordless groan alerted me to the collapsed tent. \n\nI rushed to the noise and cried out in horror at the sight of my father\u2019s ruined body. I knelt down beside him, cradling his head in my lap. The flickering firelight was enough to see the vicious wounds all across his face, pouring red. His jaw was horribly broken, his chin shifted almost two inches to the right of where it should be. His eyes were swollen shut, and his nose turned at an impossible angle. The hatchet I\u2019d left with him at the fire was buried three inches into his chest, and I could see white poking through a hole in his left pant leg. The rest of him was fully covered by the deep furrows of claws, as if a wild animal tried to tear him apart.\n\nI\u2019d done a couple years in the Boy Scouts, earned a medical merit badge, but I was at a loss for anything to do for him. Still, I gently started to lay Dad down, thinking to try and find the first aid kit that must still be somewhere in the ruined piles of gear, but he reached out, grabbing my wrist with surprising, desperate strength.  In a haze, I noticed two of his fingers had been torn from his hand. I stopped moving him, leaned down to listen, to see if he was going to try and say something. Maybe he could tell me what caused this catastrophe, what happened to the others. All I could hear, though, was the rough wheeze of his breath being painfully forced in and out of his lungs. Tears fell from my eyes, intermingling with the blood still seeping from his face, as his breathing caught, rattled, and then stopped. \n\nA sob escaped my throat as I clutched at my father\u2019s corpse, the best and strongest man I\u2019d ever known. My thoughts were a jumble of puzzle pieces in my head, shock and grief and disbelief all fighting for position. My entire body trembled uncontrollably.\n\nUnexpectedly, one realization managed to push through the gauze that my mind was wrapped in, the thought cool and cold as a piece of granite. Whoever did this to Dad was still out there. They had the others, and they might come back for me. \n\nMy stomach turning, I reached down, bracing myself, and managed to pull the hatchet out of Dad\u2019s chest, the blade releasing with a sickening crack. A downpour of blood escaped from the newly revealed opening, but I told myself I wasn\u2019t causing any more harm. There was no more harm to cause.\n\nI sniffed hard to clear my incredibly stuffed nose. I stood and took stock of my situation. There was no phone to call for help. Dad always insisted on completely unplugging for the trip, and it\u2019s not like there\u2019d have been service even if I had one. Sean, Dennis, and the girls were missing, possibly dead, or possibly worse. If I tried to find help, it would be hours before I got back with anyone, and by then it would be too late to do anything. I moved down to the canoes.\n\nAll three were where we left them, but enormous tears had been ripped in each of their hulls. There was no way I could use one as is. As I looked over the boats, trying to determine if there was any way to repair one enough to make it at least partially floatworthy, the beam of my flashlight caught on a series of footprints impressed in the riverbank, the dirt made soft by the recent rainfall. I shuddered to see them. Larger than a grown man\u2019s, the prints were made by something heavy, its feet both clawed and webbed like an enormous platypus. A rustling in some nearby bushes caused me to start. Cautiously I approached the noise, using the hatchet to push away some of the tall grass hiding the motion, my mind going numb as my flashlight found the source.\n\nThe creature was big. Not huge, certainly, but definitely over six feet long and weighing several hundred pounds. It had four limbs, roughly arranged in the same anatomical layout as a human. The beam of my light reflected dully off slimy scales covering the entirety of its body, their color a dark green, almost black. Both its hands and feet were webbed and clawed like the footprints I found, but its fingers looked like they might be dexterous enough to use tools. The thing\u2019s head was some kind of hideous cross between human and fish. Whiskers like a sturgeon drooped from its cheeks and it opened its mouth to snarl at me, its teeth arranged in a circular pattern like a lamprey. The sound it made was weak, but I recognized the same strange call that Dennis and I heard earlier.\n\nI could also tell it was badly hurt. The thing was trying to drag itself back to the river, but there was an enormous gash in its shoulder impeding it. Its left arm was almost torn from its body and leaking blood, though not as much as I would have expected. I realized that Dad must have been the one to wound this creature, though he certainly got the worst of the exchange. A cold fury began to work its way up from deep inside my stomach, and I raised the hatchet with the intent to finish the monster off before a thought stopped me.\n\nI had no way of knowing where Tara and the rest were taken, but it must have been by other creatures like this one. It appeared to be aquatic, or amphibious, and with no way of even knowing which way they went down the river, I\u2019d have no way to find their lair on my own. I considered the dilemma and came upon a possible solution. \nNoting the relative slowness that the creature was managing to claw its way to the water, I went back to the trashed campsite and began rifling through the gear. It didn\u2019t take me long to find what I was searching for: a spool of all purpose parachute cord and a box of chem lights. I pulled out my pocket-knife and quickly cut lengths of cord, tying slip-knot loops through half a dozen of the lights before cracking them to life in a bright green flash of neon. I also took a pair of two-foot long pieces of cord and tied one end to each handle of the hatchet and flashlight, the other to my belt, before securing the tools as best I could in my waistband.\n\nReturning to the creature, who was only feet from the river, I took my lifejacket from the ruined canoe and pulled it on. I took four others and used their straps to tie them to each other, considering the next step of my strategy. The closeness to the water, or possibly my nearness, sent the monster into greater efforts, as it flopped, squirming towards the perceived safety of the river. I softly approached it and, as it thrashed, managed to loop three of the chem lights around its various limbs, securing the last one just as it made the water. It would have to be enough. Being submerged seemed to invigorate it, confirming my suspicions of the creature\u2019s aquatic nature, though it was still clearly hampered by its wound. If it weren\u2019t for my doctored lights, it would have been impossible to tell where the creature was in the water, and even with them I could tell I\u2019d have to try to stay close or risk losing it. \n\nSlipping into the river, I arranged myself on the secured lifejackets like a makeshift raft and began to follow the fleeing fish monster, hoping against hope that it would take me to wherever my family is.\n\nI abandoned all sense of time, my focus entirely kept on keeping track of the three, small balls of glowing light moving gradually down the river. I followed the creature through one fork, then another, then another, before I lost track and stopped trying. I was thankful the thing was as badly hurt as it was; I realized its injury was all that was keeping it moving slowly enough that I could keep it in sight, and likely the only reason it hadn\u2019t attacked me.  \n\nMy throat tightened when I saw one of the chem lights separate from the others, falling to the bottom of the river and sinking into the silt, apparently having been kicked lose from the monster. Somewhat unsteadily, the other two glided away though, continuing in the same direction they had been, so I kept following, sending up a silent prayer that the remaining cords stayed secure.\n\nAbruptly, the motion stopped. The lights which I\u2019d been following perhaps two feet underwater now bobbed to the top. Cautiously I approached, fearful I knew the reason. Before long, I confirmed I was right; the monster had bled out. It floated on the surface of the river, a lethal goldfish dead in its massive bowl. \n\nThe cold and wet and dark, unnoticed until now, warded away by fear and the adrenaline of my pursuit, came crashing down on me. I shivered, supported by the extra lifejackets I could only hope I\u2019ll need, trying to figure out what to do next. \n\nI tried to work things through logically. We\u2019d been traveling quite a way from the island. The monster lair couldn\u2019t be much farther. Besides, for a lack of better ideas, and since I didn\u2019t have anything truly better to do, I\u2019d just have to try and search the riverbank for a cave or something. And pray. \n\nI moved to the side of the river the creature seemed to be heading for. Nearing the bank, I fumbled for my flashlight. My heart leapt when I found it wasn\u2019t there before I remembered the safety line I\u2019d tied to it. Thanking my past self for his preparations, I traced the cord still secured to my belt and pulled the flashlight into my grasp. I had to smack it against my palm a time or two before it weakly turned on, its claims of a waterproof nature apparently more for advertisement than actual use.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take me long to find what I\u2019m looking for. \n\nThe Allegheny isn\u2019t terribly deep even in wet years, maybe eight or nine feet on average. I could see from the marks on the bank where the water would typically be four feet overhead, and the yawning hole I found was only submerged about halfway. I thought back to what Jerry had said earlier, about how this was the driest season in decades. Any normal year, the opening would be fully underwater, but now\u2026\n\nI shone the flashlight into the hole, fear of dark enclosed spaces gripping my heart. The opening was certainly big enough that I could fit, but there was no way to know that it stayed that way, no way to know this was in fact the monster\u2019s lair, or that Tara or Dennis or Amanda or Sean were still alive. \n\nMy mind returned to Dad\u2019s ruined face, his last, gasping breaths, and I sighed. I had to try. \n\nIt was awkward going to say the least, dragging the four extra life jackets with me, but if I found any of the others, and if they were in bad shape, and if we had to swim any distance to get out\u2026\n\nThere were way too many \u201cifs\u201d going through my mind. \n\nThe tunnel went into the riverbank for fifty yards or so before dipping down. It remained consistently  half-full and I float-swam along. My breathing rate increased, reaching the point I was practically hyperventilating, the claustrophobic sense of the earth crushing in around me competing with the understanding that I may be trapping myself in a den of killer fish monsters. I managed to get ahold of myself and continue onwards.\n\nAfter a subjective eternity, the passage I\u2019d been swimming through emerged into a cavern of significant size, maybe fifteen or twenty feet tall and three times that across. Coming out of the wall I fell with a splash into a sort of underground lagoon that took up the majority of the cavern. The walls of the cave glowed with a faint luminescence, enough to faintly see by, though I didn\u2019t know enough marine biology to say what kind of algae or whatever was causing it.  I swam to the shore, and found my efforts were rewarded. There were dozens of webbed clawprints similar to those on the island, as well as some other marks that looked like something had been dragged. I could only hope it was the rest of my group. \n\nThere were at least a dozen different passages off the cavern I was in, but the freshest prints and drag marks seemed to head down three of them. There might have been other exits to this underground warren, but I didn\u2019t know where they were, and it was going to be way too difficult to bring the lifejackets with me. I had no idea how we would get back up the passage I came in through, but that would have to be something I figured out later. I found a small recess in the wall that I was able to stash the extra vests in before taking out the hatchet and flashlight, picking the leftmost footprint marked tunnel at random, and creeping along as stealthily as my squelching shoes would let me.\n\nThe flashlight was almost unnecessary. The algae persisted enough to light my way so I kept the beam off, and moved as carefully as I could, pausing every few steps to listen for sounds that might reveal the location of more monsters or my family. Seemingly far away down the passage, I heard hooting calls like the ones Dennis and I heard earlier, but there was something about the tone that made me think it was just the creatures communicating, rather than an alarm that they knew I was there. \n\nThe passage floor was slimy, so I very careful to avoided slipping and falling. Fortunately, there didn\u2019t seem to be any other passageways to choose from, or else I would have had to start making some difficult choices. The tunnel I\u2019d chosen opened into a cavern only slightly smaller than the one containing the lagoon. The algae on the walls here was even more highly concentrated, and though it was not as bright as lighting a lamp, the glow was still more than enough for me to see by. \n\nI wished I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSean was suspended upside down, his arms and legs secured spread-eagle to poles on either side of him by rough looking rope and surrounded by four of the fish-monsters, one considerably larger than the others. A piece of wood had been wedged in his mouth, but I could see he was awake, his wide eyes fear-filled and wild, his head whipping back and forth. \n\nMy earlier suspicion that the creatures could use tools was confirmed as the largest creature took a flint knife and deftly cut away Sean\u2019s clothes, leaving him hanging naked.  It made its strange cries all the while, and I realized that, based on the rapt attention of the three smaller creatures, this must have been the monster\u2019s version of a school lesson. Clothes fully removed, the monster took Sean\u2019s hair in one clawed hand, bent his head back, and cut his throat. \n\nI stifled a cry, jamming my hand into my mouth as Sean\u2019s life poured from the gaping wound. I could tell he was trying to scream himself, but between the wooden gag and his own blood choking him, he only managed to emit a panicked gurgle. The gout didn\u2019t last long, the creature must have severed both carotid arteries, and soon the blood was only dripping. I fought the urge to be violently ill as the fish monster continued to dress its catch, slicing open Sean\u2019s belly and removing his stomach and intestines, the smell like nothing I\u2019d ever experienced before. \n\nI cautiously edged away from the gruesome scene, unable to take it for even another moment. I was furious that I didn\u2019t do something to save Sean but at the same time knew there was nothing I could have reasonably done. I could only pray I would have better luck with Dennis and the girls. \n\nI made it back to the entrance cave and followed the second tunnel with the drag marks. I still moved cautiously, but faster than I had before. If I\u2019d been only a few minutes faster, maybe I could have done something to help my stepfather; I couldn\u2019t let something like that happen to the others. \n\nSimilar to the first tunnel, this one also didn\u2019t seem to have any offshoots. Part of me wondered whether these paths are natural rock formations or if the creatures somehow carved them out. Where the other was fairly straight, this one was far more winding with noticeable changes in elevation. The height of the tunnel remained relatively constant, thankfully, and other than having to duck a time or two my earlier feelings of claustrophobia were generally kept at bay. \n\nThe room the second tunnel emerged into was smaller than the one Sean was murdered in. The algae remained on the walls, though in lesser concentration. The room was dim and, if I was right that these passages had been designed by the creatures, there must have been a reason for that. The floor was covered in almost a dozen of what I could best describe as nests, their makeup comprised of everything from ratty blankets and old scraps of leather to tree branches and castaway clothing. I carefully peeked into the closest nest, my stomach turning at the mass of squirming flesh writhing and convulsing in its middle. It was several long seconds before I realized what it must be: a pile of fish monsters in some kind of larval stage. I\u2019d stumbled upon the monster\u2019s version of a nursery. The tadpole things, their mouths gaping wide with those lamprey-like teeth, wiggled and gnashed disgustingly.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all gone.\u201d\n\n(continued in comment below)",

            "comment": "My heart leapt into my throat at the words that sounded from the other side of the room. I turned to look for the source and was amazed to find Dennis sitting alone, his back to the wall.\n\n\u201cThey took them all but left me.\u201d\n\nI rushed to his side. \n\n\u201cDennis? Hey, Dennis!\u201d\n\nHe turned to look at me, but his eyes were glassy and blank. \n\n\u201cWhy did they leave me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, man, but come on we have to find the girls. Do you know where they took them?\u201d\n\nI pulled on his arm, attempting to drag him to his feet.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t wanna go. Wanna stay here.\u201d\n\nHe began to fight against me, tried to peel my hand away from his arm.\n\n\u201cCome on, Dennis, cut it out!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t wanna go!!\u201d he practically shouted before reaching down and trying to bite me. \n\nI yelped and dropped his arm, my brother sinking back down cross legged to the floor. I looked around hurriedly. There was a passage on the opposite side of the room from the one I came in, and I thought I could hear fish monster noises heading toward me. It only made sense; they wouldn\u2019t want to leave their nursery unguarded. I couldn\u2019t afford to fight with Dennis before I found the girls, and he seemed safe enough for the moment, for whatever reason.\n\n\u201cDennis, I think something broke in you. I\u2019ll be back, but I have to go find Tara and Amanda, ok?\u201d\n\nHe mumbled something, but whether it was a response to me or to whatever voices were talking in his head I couldn\u2019t tell.\n\nI left, hurrying to ensure the monsters coming to check on their young didn\u2019t find me. \n\nI\u2019d traded all sense of stealth for speed at this point. I didn\u2019t totally understand what was going on, and I couldn\u2019t afford to let the monsters find me, but I had to find my sister and her friend. \n\nI jogged down the third and final tunnel with the drag marks, praying that this was where Tara and Amanda were taken and not some other helpless victim. This tunnel was shorter than the other two and it didn\u2019t take me more than a few moments to reach another room, this one dominated by a cage made of thick branches, another tunnel on the far wall continuing farther into the lair. A large iron lock secured the cage door, and I wondered how the monsters could have gotten ahold of it. Unfortunately, there was no key helpfully hung upon the wall. A quick examination made it obvious I\u2019d have had better luck hacking through the cage bars than the lock, but considering their thickness, even that would have taken considerable time I didn\u2019t have.\n\nA form lay huddled in the far corner of the cage. It was covered by a rough blanket so that I couldn\u2019t see who or what it was, but I had to believe they were a prisoner. The algae on the walls there was incredibly dim, so I turned on my flashlight and shined it on the shape.\n\n\u201cPsst. Hey. Who are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs\u2026is someone there?\u201d The form rolled and shifted toward me. The cage ceiling was too low for them to stand, but they crawled toward the sound of my voice. \u201cI can\u2019t see you, please help me.\u201d\n\nI took a step back as the prisoner reached my side of the cage, grasping at the bars. I could do nothing but gasp in horror. She was filthy and naked, besides the blanket draped around her, but despite that I recognized her; it was Jerry\u2019s missing wife Cheryl. Her eyes were gone, carved from her head and leaving only wet, empty sockets. \n\nShe was heavy and swollen with pregnancy.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged, \u201cit hurts.\u201d \n\nMy mind struggled for a long moment, half trying to come up with some plan to help, the other attempting to wake itself up from this nightmare, when she fell back to her side with a cry, shuddering. Cheryl\u2019s belly seemed to distend, as if something inside it was struggling to be free. The flesh of her middle pulsed in and out, in and out, and then, abruptly, tore open. She screamed in pain as dozens of the small, white fish-tadpole things like the ones I\u2019d seen in the nest poured out of her womb. Their birthing wails were miniature versions of the fish monster calls, and with revulsion I watched as they squirmed about and began to devour Cheryl, small pockmarks of flesh torn wherever their mouths touched. More and more of the creatures crawled from inside her and joined the feast, continuing even after her screams turned to small whimpers of pain, the whimpers to silence. This was at last too much, and I threw up in great, gasping heaves. The monsters paid me no mind, continuing to eat.\n\nI kept vomiting, beyond when my stomach was empty and my throat hurt from the effort. After a long time, too long, I managed to pull myself together. I heard noises from back the way I came so, with little other choice, I picked up my hatchet and flashlight, and continued on. \n\nThe tunnel continued farther and farther away from my point of entry and from Dennis. My luck continued to run dry, and now there were intersections and branching routes to choose from. I picked at random. At one point I thought I heard sobbing, only to realize after a moment it was coming from me. \n\nThe algae was fully gone now, the flashlight guttered and died, but I carried onward, desperate, unknowing what else to do but take another step forward. I heard a deep roar ahead, like a great sleeping beast, but still I went on. \n\nSuddenly, the tunnel disappeared, my foot didn\u2019t strike the ground I was sure would be there, and I was falling, falling, down and down. I hit water with a crash, the wind knocked from my chest, and I was borne away on an underground current. \n\nDisoriented, blind to everything, my head struck rock, the blackness of unconsciousness indiscernible from the abyss I\u2019d been fleeing. \n\n\u201cHey, I think he\u2019s alive!\u201d\n\nAwareness returned. I was lying on my back, soaking wet, the mid-morning sun shining upon my face, a ring of concerned faces looking down on me. \n\n\u201cSon, what can you remember? Where did ya come from?\u201d A man wearing a traditional captain\u2019s hat and a thick beard helped me sit up. My head throbbed. I realized I was on the top deck of a boat, a sign on the bulkhead proclaiming \u201cMonongahela Gateway Clipper.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe found ya bobbing along. Heck yer lifejacket\u2019s the only thing that kept ya only half drowned! Did ya fall overboard or somethin\u2019? Was there anyone else with ya?\u201d\n\nI looked at the man. His eyes were kind but concerned. \n\nI thought for a moment, trying to decide what I could possibly say.\n\n\u201cThere was,\u201d I told him slowly, \u201cbut they\u2019re gone.\u201d",

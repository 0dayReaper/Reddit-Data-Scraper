    "postText": "Dad shut himself inside his bunker at the beginning of 2020. He said the world was about to end and when we didn\u2019t believe him, he told us to wake up. It was raining that day. I remember focusing on the water hitting the windowpanes while my sister tried to change Dad\u2019s mind. I knew it was no use. He was too stubborn to listen to anyone except maybe Donald Trump. WHO had just declared that COVID-19 had pushed the world into a pandemic. Dad wanted us to join him and when we told him no, he called us brainwashed.\n\nHe purchased the land before I was born. Only because of the dilapidated military facility that came with it. It was abandoned sometime in the 60s, I think. My sister was there from the beginning, even before Dad\u2019s obsession pushed Mom away. It\u2019s hard for me to imagine what he was like back then. Mom says he was a gentleman. But they married young, and a person can change a lot during those years. And so did Dad. All I remember from him during childhood are the weekends at the bunker. Constantly renovating it and stockpiling it with everything he would need to survive down there.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t stop him. He wasn\u2019t the best Dad, not even a good one, but it was sad to see him go all the same. He was excited, even though he thought that civilization was about to collapse. I guess that happens when you\u2019ve spent your entire adult life preparing. We had to set up an old radio to keep in touch with him. He didn\u2019t trust mobile phones. We didn\u2019t hear from him often, just once a month, sometimes less. The last time he radioed in, he said he had found a hidden door. He was going to see where it went. That was three months ago.\n\n\u201cYou think he\u2019s okay?\u201d my sister said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t in great health. I *told* him.\u201d\n\nWe sat in the car, on our way to check up on him, driving through the heatwave.\n\n\u201cHis radio might have broken down,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s not assume the worst.\u201d\n\nBut I felt worried too. There was something strange about that hidden door, and his tone when he mentioned it. It didn\u2019t sit right with me. But maybe it was just the heat and the endless desert around us that played tricks on my mind. I couldn\u2019t really tell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was dark when we arrived. Dad\u2019s truck stood where he had left it, beneath some tarp that blew in the chilly, sand-carrying wind. We turned on our flashlights and walked to the cliff above the bunker. The steel door was made to withstand a nuclear blast. Luckily, I owned the only spare key in existence. Before I used it, I banged on the door as hard as I could and yelled for Dad. I worried he would mistake us for intruders and shoot us. If he was confused, and if it was dark, it was a real possibility. I banged again and yelled at the top of my lungs:\n\n\u201cDad, are you there? It\u2019s me, Josh! Eveline is here as well!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he can hear you,\u201d Eveline said.\n\nI nodded. \u201cDad! I\u2019m going to open the door now!\u201d\n\nI was seventeen the last time I was here. Back then it was the Muslims that were going to end civilization as we knew it. Before that, it was the Russians. Now it was China. There was always something threatening his beloved freedom, and yet he was never truly free. My sister put her hand on my wrist just as I was about to unlock the door.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe we should just call the authorities after all and\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019ll fight them.\u201d\n\nI unlocked the heavy door. A rancid smell escaped the darkness inside. It was the odor of death. I recognized it from when Dad tried\u2013\u2013and ultimately failed\u2013\u2013to learn how to hunt and let a reindeer carcass rot on the property for weeks. My sister had already stopped visiting him by then. I didn\u2019t tell her what the smell reminded me of. She covered her nose with her shirt. We descended the spiral stairs. It creaked for each step we took, almost as if it was about to fall apart.\n\nI tried the light switch at the bottom. The click echoed throughout the long corridor leading to the living area. Nothing happened.\n\n\u201cHm.\u201d I realized that the batteries, which he charged by the use of an old exercise bike, were dead. That meant he was most likely dead as well. \u201cThe generator could be broken,\u201d I said. \u201cBut\u2026 Maybe you should wait back here, just in case\u2026 you know.\u201d\n\nI pointed my flashlight in front of me. The light was too weak to reach the end of the corridor. On the way here I had felt ready. I felt sad, the kind of empty sadness you feel after the death of a parent that was never any good, but I didn\u2019t feel worried. Now, on the other hand, while staring into the dark corridor that I used to run through as a kid\u2026 I was afraid. The fear reminded me of how my childhood night terrors used to start. They always crept up on me in the darkness, grew with the grotesque shadows on my bedroom ceiling.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not letting you go in there alone,\u201d Eveline said. \u201cWe stay together.\u201d\n\nWe walked into the darkness. The foul smell intensified for every step we took, and so did my heartbeat. I was glad my sister didn\u2019t stay behind. The bunker seemed so much smaller than I remembered it, much more cramped. The asymmetry between my memories and reality made everything feel off somehow, just as if the bunker was merely a model of the real thing. But it wasn\u2019t. I had just grown up.\n\nThe Confederate flag greeted us at the end of the corridor. It hung on the concrete wall. It looked pale in the hotspot of the flashlight, almost like a phantom. And, of course, in many ways it was. A ghost from a time long ago. Or perhaps a corpse brought back to life. An abomination. It reminded me of Dad more than anything else.\n\n\u201cYou have to be seriously confused to praise freedom as much as Dad and hang that symbol of lesser freedom in the world on your wall,\u201d Eveline said.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to protect his freedom so much that he built a prison for himself.\u201d I removed the light from the flag, leaving only darkness. \u201cYou bet he was confused.\u201d\n\nWe entered the main chamber. It was overfilled with litter and clutter. Empty cans\u2013\u2013both the food and beer kinds\u2013\u2013lay scattered across the sticky floor. We had to take large steps not to step on any of the trash.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s weird.\u201d Eveline pointed her flashlight at the small dining table. \u201cLook.\u201d\n\nMy hair stood up on my neck before I even realized what she meant. The table was set for three people. I didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, trying to process what I was seeing, and just when I was about to speak my sister interrupted me:\n\n\u201cWho the *fuck* was here with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know\u2013\u201d I began. \u201cI mean, he might have left the old plates on the table and\u2013\u201d\n\nA sound of something falling to the ground came from one of the other rooms further into the bunker. I pointed my light in its direction but couldn\u2019t see what made it.\n\n\u201cDad!\u201d I yelled. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Josh! You there?\u201d\n\nNo response.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d Eveline whispered. \u201cSomething isn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nI only vaguely heard what she said. My focus was on something else. Something on the wall on the other end of the room.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not supposed to be there.\u201d I slowly walked toward it. \u201cThat must have been what he talked about over the radio.\u201d\n\nDad had hacked away a layer of concrete, for whatever reason, and uncovered a rusty, metal door behind it. It stood ajar. A lukewarm, musty breeze came out of it. My sister walked up to me as I carefully pried the door open with the back of my flashlight. I felt my heart in my throat. I could hear my sister begging for us to leave, almost in tears. But I needed to know what was behind that door. It was imperative to understand what had happened here. I needed to know. I needed closure.\n\n\u201cWhat in heavens name\u2026\u201d Eveline looked over my shoulder. \u201cWhy is this here?\u201d\n\nBehind the door was a room about the size of a broom cupboard. It was unremarkable except for a circular hole in the middle of the floor. I shone my light into it, but I couldn\u2019t see the bottom. Just as I thought it was big enough for a person, my sister said:\n\n\u201cDo you think he fell?\u201d\n\nDrops of sweat from my forehead fell down the pit. I felt dizzy and stepped back, afraid I would fall inside. My sister picked up a can filled with some rotten beans and threw it down the hole. It clattered against the walls as it bounced from one side to another. The sound faded away until we couldn\u2019t hear it anymore. There was no indication it touched down at the bottom. I stretched out my hand and held it above the opening.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s warm,\u201d I said. \u201cThe air, I mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe he fell.\u201d Eveline stepped back, almost as if she were convinced. \u201cCan we please get out of here?\u201d She reached for my arm. \u201cWe can return with the police. Please\u2026 Josh?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t dark when Dad found this,\u201d I said. \u201cHe would have seen the hole.\u201d\n\n\u201cJosh? Please.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust give me a moment to think.\u201d I walked toward the hallway that led to the other rooms, desperately hoping to find him. For some reason, it was important for me to see him. To be able to leave without wondering. I needed to know that he was truly dead. \u201cI just want to\u2013\u201d I stopped myself after I accidentally pointed the flashlight on the floor in the middle of the hallway, revealing a pair of feet. \u201cI think I found him!\u201d I ran up to the body.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d Eveline yelled and reluctantly followed me to avoid being left alone.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Dad. I screamed upon the realization. My mind couldn\u2019t comprehend what I had just seen. I spun around and tried to run away, completely acting on instinct, and crashed into my sister. She grabbed me, kept me still, and as she looked behind me, down at the dead body on the floor, she began to cry while her hands trembled uncontrollably against my shoulders.\n\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d she said. \u201cHow\u2026 how is it possible? It\u2019s you!\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get a fuck out of here,\u201d I said. \u201cMove!\u201d\n\nThere was nothing that could explain this, and the more my mind tried to\u2013\u2013moving in an endless loop doing so\u2013\u2013the dread grew inside me. I only got a glimpse of the body before I panicked, but my sister was right. The half-rotten face was the same as mine, with a bullet hole in the middle of the forehead.\n\nWe stumbled our way through the living area, tipping over chairs and kicking cans all over the place, and just as we were about to get out of the mess a familiar voice echoed through the hallway we had just escaped.\n\n\u201cJosh!\u201d\n\nIt was Dad. We both stopped in our tracks.\n\n\u201cIs that you? Josh!\u201d\n\n\u201cDad?\u201d I yelled back. \u201cWhat the fuck is going on here?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d It sounded like he was at the other end of the bunker, possibly inside the storeroom. \u201cI killed the son of a bitch, put a bullet right between his eyes!\u201d\n\n\u201cCome out from there!\u201d I yelled. \u201cWe have to leave, it\u2019s not safe here!\u201d\n\nSilence.\n\n\u201cSomething is wrong,\u201d Eveline said. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cDad!\u201d I yelled. \u201cCome out!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t move!\u201d Dad said. \u201cI\u2019m stuck under a shelf! I\u2019ll need your help, son!\u201d\n\nI turned to my sister. \u201cGo back up. I\u2019ll get that old bastard out of there. We\u2019ll be right behind you, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cThink, Josh!\u201d Eveline begged. \u201cYou think he\u2019s been stuck under a shelf for\u2013\u201d\n\nI should have listened, but even after what we had just seen I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to even consider something as outlandish as what my sister was suggesting. It was simply too far-fetched, too unbelievable to penetrate all my layers of presumptions about reality. It couldn\u2019t be, it just couldn\u2019t. Hence, I ran back to the hallway, yelling for my sister to get back up to the surface and wait for us there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming, Dad!\u201d\n\nI only slowed down to carefully step over the corpse that bore my face. Perhaps, I thought, it was just a coincidence. A burglar that just happened to look like me. After all, the face had begun to rot. It wasn\u2019t obviously me. I felt stupid and I almost convinced myself that it was just my childhood fear of the dark coming back to life down here. And then, just as I was about to walk past the small composting toilet that stood inside a small room at the end of the hallway, I stopped. Shivers spread across my entire body, paralyzing me. Dad sat on the toilet. His gun still hung from his trigger finger and his brain was splattered across the wall behind him. He had his journal in his lap, covered in blood.\n\n\u201cJosh!\u201d Dad yelled from the darkness. \u201cHelp me!\u201d\n\nI was frozen in place, both by fear and confusion, unable to make any decisions.\n\n\u201cCome on, Josh!\u201d Dad kept yelling. \u201cI need your help, son!\u201d\n\nMy mind was racing. There was no way of knowing who was who. When I heard Dad\u2019s voice yelling for help while watching his dead body, nothing but absolute terror revibrated inside me. I slowly reached for the journal in Dad\u2019s lap and grabbed it, hoping it would shed some light on the situation. I was just about to open it when my sister screamed. I ran back, this time jumping over my doppelg\u00e4nger's body, and found her looking at something at the corner of the main chamber.\n\n\u201cI told you to\u2013\u201d I said, but changed my mind. \u201cAre you okay, what happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2013\u201d she cried. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\n\nCrawled up in the corner was her naked, dead body. Her head had been twisted in such a way that the neck had been broken.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something seriously wicked going on here,\u201d I said. \u201cDad shot himself in the head, a long time ago by the looks of it, and yet he keeps yelling for help. Let\u2019s get back to the car, now!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe drove away from the bunker as fast as we could, leaving whatever was still alive down there yelling for help. My sister insisted on staying at my place for a few days. I didn\u2019t mind having her around. We shared an experience no one else could relate to, and we needed each other to overcome the trauma.\n\nIt took a day for me to build up the courage to open Dad\u2019s journal. It began with his usual deranged conspiracy theories. I flipped past them. At the end, he had only made short notes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Found a hidden door.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Deep pit, possible the remains of some old black project.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Eveline and Josh woke me up. A \u201csurprise visit\u201d. Didn\u2019t hear them enter. Strange.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Had dinner with them, something seems off.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*It isn\u2019t them!

She\u2019s still out there somewhere. I only got one bullet left. I won\u2019t allow her to do that abhorrent thing to me. Forgive me.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy sister has been cooking for hours. She just called for me from the kitchen:\n\n\u201cJosh? Come here, I want to show you something!\u201d\n\n[ME](https://www.reddit.com/r/tobiasmalm/comments/112r4le/i_just_released_my_novel_the_cave_to_another/)",

So who knows what will happen at this point. And my guess is that Josh didn't show her the journal.",

They go inside the bunker and there are these creatures inside. Well, only one of the hikers make it out, and the Russian authorities shoot him face down into the snow.... the body from the beginning was him. Some weird time warp thing. I wish I remembered the name of the movie!",

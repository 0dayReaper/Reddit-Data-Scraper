    "postText": "I\u2019ve been waiting to talk about this. I\u2019ve been looking for others with similar experiences, or\u2026 I dunno. Maybe I hoped I was insane. Months have passed, and I still don\u2019t have the slightest idea what to believe. But no matter what is true and what isn\u2019t, the memory of what happened to me is as true as can be.\n\nAnd every time I put my hand to a door, I tremble.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was looking for a house in the surrounding area. I know, being a homeowner at 27 seems like a dream. I know I\u2019ve been fortunate. Even so, I wanted something remote, spacious, and comparably cheap.\n\nI\u2019d been looking for something nearby, but everything even close to a larger city quickly ran out of my price range. It wasn\u2019t until I started looking at the rural outskirts that I started to see something realistic.\n\nI\u2019d been to four open house showings in the past week when I came across an ad that looked too good to be true. Another open house, but this one was just perfect. Apparently, they were looking to make a quick sale after a previous deal had fallen through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made my way to a small nearby town called Tomskog. There was a little billboard with a blue sunflower greeting me, and I took a hard right down a street named \u201cSunplenty Road\u201d. There were only five houses there, and the one I came to look at was at the far end. Even from a distance, I could tell I wasn\u2019t the only visitor.\n\nI parked on the street outside and took in the sights. There was an \u201cOpen House\u201d sign outside, again with the sunflower logo. There was a separate garage, and the house itself was smaller than expected. Homely, but small.\n\nI was greeted by a cheerful man. He had thick glasses, a receding hairline, and the kind of \u201cfun uncle\u201d smile that told me he could get away with anything.\n\n\u201cCome on in,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna love it.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was me, the realtor, and three other people. A middle-aged couple, and a younger woman. She had this messy black hair that kept poking her in the eye. Even at a glance I could tell the young woman was distraught. She wasn\u2019t even looking around the house, she seemed more interested in the people wandering about.\n\nThe house had a simple and open layout. The bottom floor had a bathroom, a separate study room, an adjoining kitchen, and a lounge area. There were stairs leading to a sort of catwalk on the second floor, making the main room wide open. The second floor had another bathroom, a bedroom, and a guest room.\n\nIt had this sort of sullen 70\u2019s vibe with grey and white flower-patterned wallpaper. There were little scuffs and tears pretty much everywhere, but the house itself seemed\u2026 fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe realtor, Anders, showed me all the details of the kitchen. He assured me that most of the appliances were to be replaced before the next homeowner moved in, and proudly displayed the new garbage disposal. It was a nice enough setup, but I couldn\u2019t tear my eyes away from the young woman standing outside the study. I got the feeling that she was standing guard.\n\nAs the middle-aged couple walked downstairs, they asked her they could have a look.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she answered, with a shrug. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind her,\u201d Anders the realtor smiled. \u201cOf course you can.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she insisted. \u201cThey can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAnders walked up to her and leaned in. His demeanor shifted. They argued back and forth, and I could hear her repeat, over and over;\n\n\u201cThis is not what we agreed to.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe middle-aged couple and I just looked at one another. While the realtor and the young woman argued, we introduced ourselves. I smiled and gave them my name. They were named Helen and Sebastian, or \u2018Seb\u2019 for short. Typical midwestern salt-of-the-earth kind of people. They were suffering from an empty nest and seemed to want a place to start over. They made no secret about being interested in the place, although Helen wasn\u2019t sure about having no direct access to the garage. Seb, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t sure about the soil. He wanted a proper garden, and the soil seemed ill-fit to sustain greenery.\n\n\u201cStill,\u201d Helen smiled. \u201cBest place we\u2019ve seen so far.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure is,\u201d added Seb, giving Helen a little shake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnders kept arguing with the young woman. I could overhear her name as Whitney, and she was not willing to cooperate. Finally, Anders just pushed past her, putting his keys in the lock.\n\n\u201cRight this way, we\u2019ll just take a quick peek.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not done in there,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just-\u201c\n\n\u201cIt was supposed to be packed up, Whitney. I can\u2019t help that you\u2019re late.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2026 please. Give me an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had plenty of hours.\u201d\n\nHe clicked the door open and pushed it in. The three of us gave Whitney an apologetic look as we stepped inside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe study was a mess. Old clothes strewn across various furniture, loose papers and books haphazardly thrown across a musky desk. An entire wall of bookshelves full of textbooks, ranging from discrete mathematics to philosophical physics. I stood there for a few seconds, taking it all in. Whitney pushed past us, grabbing an empty box from the floor.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch anything,\u201d she sighed. \u201cJust\u2026 look at it, and leave.\u201d\n\nAnders leaned over to us, lowering his voice.\n\n\u201cYou have to excuse her,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThere were some\u2026 complications, with the former owner.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, she\u2019s\u2026 the, uh, the daughter?\u201d Seb asked.\n\nAnders nodded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile Anders told us about the east-facing windows and the top-of-the-line air conditioning system, I couldn\u2019t help but to keep my eyes on Whitney. She was rummaging through the desk, dropping mementos, pictures, and notebooks into one of her many cardboard boxes. I could tell she was sleep deprived. She kept yawning.\n\nHelen seemed eager to just leave Whitney to her grieving, while Seb kept to the practical details. He checked the hardwood floor, the insulation on the windows, the wall linings for pests. At one point, he almost knocked over a coffee table, and Whitney came running. She caught a vase that was about to topple off the table.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t touch anything!\u201d she cried out. \u201cJust\u2026 if you have to be here, stay\u2026 stay still!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m, uh\u2026 sorry,\u201d Seb said. \u201cI was just-\u201c\n\n\u201cJust go over there!\u201d\n\nShe waved her hands around, shaking the vase. There was a little rattle coming from it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe shook it again, and I could see the color fade from her cheeks. Carefully, she tipped the vase, and something dark plopped into her hand.\n\nA large bronze key.\n\nWhitney pulled her hand back, letting the bronze key clatter to the floor. She covered her mouth, forgetting how to exhale. We just looked at her having what seemed, to us, like a mental breakdown.\n\n\u201cNobody move,\u201d she gasped. \u201cNobody\u2026 do anything.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe all just stood there. Helen and Seb barely breathed, and I was suddenly hyper-aware of how still my feet were. Anders wasn\u2019t impressed. If anything, he was fed up with this. He rolled his eyes, and picked up the key.\n\n\u201cWhitney, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re gonna have to wait outside.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, put\u2026 put that down.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can put it with your things and take it outside.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust\u2026 don\u2019t move, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re-\u201c\n\nAnders opened the door, stepped out of the study, and headed straight for the front door. Whitney dropped everything and ran after him. The rest of us followed suit.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d she called out. \u201cPlease wait!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs soon as Anders put his hand on the front door, Whitney stopped dead in her tracks.\n\n\u201cAnders, please, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cJust step away. Give me the key. I\u2019ll leave, I promise. I swear.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe opened the door and took a step forward. The bronze key passed the threshold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe\u2019d all stepped into the main lounge by now, and I heard the door to the study slam shut. There was a sort of pressure shift, making the wind move through the main lounge. Every door in the house slid shut with a click. All except the front door, which was wide open.\n\nBut there was nothing there.\n\nNot nothing as in no one standing there. No, nothing as in \u201ca nothing\u201d. Just a blank, black space.\n\nA viscous fluid where sunlight ought to be.\n\nEndless, abyssal, ocean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stared at it, mesmerized. The contrast of the bright sun coming in from the windows, bouncing off the ripples of this deep ocean doorway.\n\nAnd there, in the dark, humanoids. Tall, elongated silhouettes.\n\nAnders stepped back, but it was as if parts of him refused to move. His arms were locked in place, seemingly by an invisible force. And as he stepped back, something started pulling him in.\n\nHis limbs grew long and twisted. His knees bending and snapping at impossible angles. His scalp pulled backwards, the loose skin of his face revealing the bottom white of his eyes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2026 help!\u201d\n\nIt was all he managed to say, as he was pulled into the dark. Limbs were quietly ripped from his sockets, as his human frame was bent, twisted, torn, and mangled. Black water mixing with marrow as dark shapes turned Anders into what resembled an underwater cloud of flesh and cloth.\n\nWhitney threw herself forward, slamming the door shut, leaving the bronze key on the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScreams erupted, and I didn\u2019t even notice they were mine. It was this primal force being pulled out of me, this need to scream. Like a baby desperate for her mother. Helen backed into a corner and sunk to the floor, with Seb trying his best to comfort her. Whitney just sat there looking at the bronze key; her face breaking out in cold sweats.\n\nI felt something turn in my stomach and headed for the bathroom. Whitney ran after me, but she couldn\u2019t make it in time. I burst through the bathroom door and collapsed on the floor, hyperventilating. Whitney stayed outside, looking at me in shock.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 you\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re fine,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t. But compared to Anders, panicking on the bathroom floor seemed like a mercy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhitney stayed with me as I calmed down. Seb and Helen joined us. After a few minutes of silence, Whitney excused herself. She came back with pile of notebooks. She sat down across the hall from me, making sure not to enter the bathroom.\n\n\u201cMy dad, he\u2026 found something,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure exactly what.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should\u2026 we should leave,\u201d said Helen. \u201cWe should leave right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can climb out a window,\u201d said Seb. \u201cIf the, uh\u2026 the door is\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cJust\u2026 please,\u201d sighed Whitney. \u201cJust stay. We\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI-I mean no offense,\u201d said Helen. \u201cBut what\u2026 what on earth was that?\u201d\n\nWhitney turned the notebook to a specific page and read aloud.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been marooned in this house for thirty days. I never know where the Door is. Sometimes I can hear water, sometimes not. I tried the windows, but it nearly burst my eardrums from the pressure as water came rushing in. I can\u2019t leave. I can\u2019t move. They wait behind the Door. They wait for me to open.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhitney scratched her head. Helen looked back and forth, as if waiting for something to make sense. Seb just shook his head.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what does that even mean?\u201d asked Helen. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has to do with the doors,\u201d Whitney explained. \u201cThey wait behind the Door.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing there,\u201d said Seb. \u201cThere\u2019s light coming through the windows.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s not that easy. It\u2019s when you open it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhitney stood up and handed Helen three notebooks.\n\n\u201cWe can argue the details of dad\u2019s quantum entanglement experiment later, but that\u2019s not gonna help us.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 let\u2019s just go then,\u201d said Seb. \u201cLet\u2019s leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wanna take your chances on the front door? That it won\u2019t come back? Go ahead.\u201d\n\nSeb took a few tentative steps up to the front door. Helen wanted to protest, but she just started looking back and forth. Whitney crossed her arms and turned away.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t hear anything,\u201d said Seb. \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s there?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s somewhere,\u201d said Whitney. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know the rules. It has to do with the doors.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got up off the bathroom floor and looked at them. Seb took his hand off the front door and stepped back. Whitney turned her attention to me.\n\n\u201cYou put yourself at risk,\u201d said Whitney. \u201cThat could\u2019ve killed you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bathroom?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe door to the bathroom. Any or all of these doors, it\u2026 it could be connected. Here, let me-\u201c\n\nWhitney walked up to Helen and took one of the notebooks back. She turned to one of the latter pages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cThe framework of passageway. Concept of thought. Paired in alignment, the darkness standing shy from the mirrored back of Empyrean. Realm unwilled and unbound, misshapen by collective subconscious. We cannot pass, our world-forgotten blocks dissipated. Like a bridge cannot be built of water, and a house cannot be built of wind. But the great craftsman blames not their tools; and eternal gold can be found in humble bronze.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cBronze,\u201d I said. \u201cLike the key.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, my dad, he\u2026 we weren\u2019t on speaking terms. I\u2019ve looked at all this for days, and all I can tell is that he was off his rocker. He died in that room.\u201d\n\nWhitney pointed to the study. Helen hugged Seb tight, holding back a sob.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t leave. He was convinced that the\u2026 the door would eat him.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHelen sat down by the kitchen table. Thankfully, there was no door in-between the kitchen and the main lounge. Seb walked straight up to Whitney, grabbed her by the collar of her blouse, and slammed her up against the wall; his calm demeanor cracking at the seams.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is your fault!\u201d\n\n\u201cI-I didn\u2019t know! It was all just ramblings! I didn\u2019t have time to clear it all out, how\u2026 how could I have known?!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou recognized the key,\u201d said Helen. \u201cYou chased after him. You asked him to wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only part that keeps coming back!\u201d Whitney yelled. \u201cCheck the notebooks! The key, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s everywhere! It\u2019s everything!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what do we do?\u201d Seb asked. \u201cDo we use it or destroy it?\u201d\n\nWhitney looked at the pile of notebooks she\u2019d managed to gather from the study. It was only a handful of everything we\u2019d seen in there, but it might be enough to get some semblance of an answer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe house had six doors. The front door, the bathroom door, the study room door. On the top floor, there was another bathroom door, a door to the guest bedroom, and the main bedroom door. The bathroom door on the bottom floor was already open and considered safe. I could step in and out without a problem.\n\nWhitney explained as best as she could.\n\nHer father had grown increasingly paranoid since divorcing Whitney\u2019s mother. He\u2019d locked himself in his house, committing fully to his studies. He\u2019d always been a bit agoraphobic, and having a reason not to leave the house was a bit of a blessing in disguise. But over time, that blessing turned into a curse. An early entry read;\n\n\u201cFor years, I\u2019ve longed for the presence of mind to devote myself. And now that I can, I find myself wanting. I can\u2019t be certain. There is a Door, a passage. It binds itself seemingly spontaneously. There is a risk involved, and it is a risk I cannot take.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeb tried to call for help, but water started pouring out of his phone. Whitney found a page about \u201csemi-passages\u201d or \u201cshortcuts\u201d. Things that could be used as portals to another person or place. They weren\u2019t as conceptually clean as a door, and thus wouldn\u2019t invite \u201cThem\u201d, but the connection would go through that dark place. The place that, somehow, her father had stumbled upon.\n\nI looked at the key for a long time. I didn\u2019t dare to touch it. It was unassuming, in a way. It was old and had this sort of blocky texture; like it was made of little squares. While Helen and Seb rifled through notebooks, Whitney looked up and talked to me.\n\n\u201cHe just wanted a way to go wherever he wanted, without having to traverse the space in-between. To just go from one door to another. All he needed was a key.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why now? Why is\u2026 how are we trapped?\u201d I asked. \u201cWe got in here just fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe realtor,\u201d sighed Whitney. \u201cHe tried to leave with the key. I think that triggered it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo how do we un-trigger it?\u201d\n\nWhitney shrugged and pointed to the notebooks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had endless discussions. We compared notes, drew out theories. Helen thought we could force the bronze key out a window, but Whitney theorized that it\u2019d just leave us locked inside. I suggested we listened at each door, just to eliminate which ones were safe and which weren\u2019t. We tried, but there was seemingly no way to tell. Sometimes I could hear rushing water on the other side. Scratches on the wood. Other times, nothing. Even going back to the same door, it\u2019d sound differently each time.\n\nWe considered opening several doors at once. We spread ourselves out. I was at the upstairs bedroom door, right next to Seb by the guest room door. Whitney was downstairs by the study door, and Helen insisted on the front door. We all put our hands on the handles. I wasn\u2019t sure if I could hear something on the other side or not; my heart was pounding too loudly.\n\nThere were six doors. Five were closed, one open. Someone was probably going to die.\n\n\u201cThere is only ever one Door. He only speaks of it as a singular. It can change over time,\u201d said Whitney. \u201cThis is our best shot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t know for sure,\u201d said Seb. \u201cAnd why do we even want to open them all? There\u2019s nothing in the bedrooms, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excluding,\u201d I said. \u201cLike we did with the downstairs bathroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should close it,\u201d said Helen. \u201cShouldn\u2019t that improve our chances of\u2026 of our other doors being okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d sighed Whitney. \u201cAre we doing this?\u201d\n\nSeb backed away from his door, taking the hand off the handle.\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t right,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of it. It ain\u2019t right.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything erupted into an argument. Seb couldn\u2019t bring himself to risk his life for anything less than an exit, and Helen couldn\u2019t stop crying at the thought of that dark abyss. I couldn\u2019t blame her. To this day, I can\u2019t stop imagining it. Whitney, trying to act as a voice of reason, read aloud from one of the notebooks.\n\n\u201cThe concept of the passageway, the Door, changes at the flick of a thought. An alien thought, like an invisible, uncontrollable shadow of the psyche. It refuses to be controlled. My exit could be my end; or as likely, a wooden frame. Much like we cannot control the smoke of a campfire, we cannot foresee the turning of the passageway.\u201d\n\nWe all looked at one another. Helen collapsed by the front door, crying. Whitney was close to a mental breakdown. I felt this enormous burden settle in my stomach, like I was missing something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take the door off the hinges\u201d, said Seb. \u201cWe\u2019ll turn it into a\u2026 an arch. Then it ain\u2019t a door anymore. You think that\u2019ll work?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn theory, maybe,\u201d said Whitney. \u201cBut how do we do that without opening it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll\u2026 we\u2019ll take the whole frame off,\u201d Seb said. \u201cThere\u2019s a crowbar under the sink. Saw it when I checked the garbage disposal.\u201d\n\nHelen bent down next to the sink, put her hand on the kitchen cabinet handle. I gasped.\n\nWas that considered a door? Could it kill her? Would it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI imagined that dark, cold abyss. That enormous force pulling me in, turning my very form into this unrecognizable mass. Where no screams can be heard. All I\u2019d have to show for such unimaginable anguish would be a burst of bubbles; then nothing.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d I cried out. \u201cStop!\u201d\n\nBut it was too late.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNothing happened. Helen opened it, pulled out the crowbar, and that was that. But for a brief moment, I realized how Whitney\u2019s father must\u2019ve felt. That uncertainty, not knowing for sure if that one flick of the wrist would be damnation; or nothing.\n\nHelen handed the crowbar to Seb, while Whitney gave me a pat on the shoulder. I couldn\u2019t stop crying. My whole body was shaking from the sudden rush of adrenaline. Meanwhile, Seb walked up to the front door and started tapping the wood.\n\nThe theory was this; if there was no door, nothing could come through. There was no point in doing a test run, because if it didn\u2019t work, someone would lose their life either way. It was better to have an honest chance of getting out.\n\nWhitney gathered towels. She had this idea that, maybe, water might start leaking if the door was turned into a semi-passage, like a window. If so, we might have to find a way to quickly stop the flow.\n\nBy the time we got the towels, Seb started working on the door frame. As that first crack rang out, I heard a click.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe front door slid open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithout a moment\u2019s thought, Seb pushed it close. It had barely opened an inch.\n\nWe all held our breaths. We were fine. Nothing was happening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s clear!\u201d Helen called out. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing there! I saw it, it\u2026 it was nothing!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can change!\u201d Whitney yelled back. \u201cWe can\u2019t take that risk again!\u201d\n\n\u201cLike hell we can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSeb put his hand on the front door, but Whitney tackled him. The crowbar fell to the floor as Helen rushed forward to help.\n\n\u201cListen!\u201d Whitney yelled. \u201cJust listen!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA rumble, like a great whale passing in the distance. It was right there; on the other side of the front door.\n\nWithout a word, they all stood up and backed away. The door shook from the passing force. Something was definitely there.\n\n\u201cThen\u2026 then the rest should be fine,\u201d said Seb. \u201cWe can get to the study.\u201d\n\nWhitney nodded, and the two of them burst into a sprint. Helen wasn\u2019t convinced, but didn\u2019t know what to say. Whitney dropped her crowbar, and as she bent to pick it up, Seb opened the door to the study.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDarkness.\n\n\u201c\u2026no.\u201d\n\nPanic exploded. Helen grabbed his arms, trying to pull him out. Whitney crawled backwards, closing her eyes and covering her ears. I couldn\u2019t watch. All I heard was Helen, screaming his name, over and over. There was a gargle. A scream turning into an inhuman screech, like a burning pig.\n\n\u201cSebastian!\u201d Helen kept repeating. \u201cSebastian! Sebastian!\u201d\n\nThere was a click, and then nothing but crying. I looked up to see Helen collapsed against the study door. It had slid shut from the pressure on the other side.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m coming, Sebby,\u201d she cried. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m-\u201c\n\nShe opened the door again.\n\nAnd there was the study, just as we\u2019d left it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHelen collapsed on the floor, curling up into a fetal position. She kept making this child-like yowling, scratching the surface of the hardwood floor, as if trying to dig Seb back into reality. But there was nothing left. Not even water droplets on the floor.\n\nThen there were her arms. She\u2019d held on until the door had slammed shut. Her sleeves were torn, and her arms bloody. Not much, but there were these round little suction marks. They were already bruising, with spots of blood poking through the skin.\n\nI sat by Helen as Whitney started rifling through the study. There were more notebooks, more theories, more diaries. Notes about experiments, clever tricks, and attempts. So far, every idea to understand the rules were in vain. We couldn\u2019t make sure. No matter what, we could never be truly sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo open doors. Four closed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t know how many hours passed. I managed to get Helen to the couch, but she was inconsolable. She could barely comprehend words anymore. She didn\u2019t blink, and she could barely breathe. There were no coherent thoughts in her mind, just\u2026 darkness. This awful, soul-sinking darkness.\n\nWhitney propped up the open doors with books and towels, to make sure they wouldn\u2019t accidentally close. All the while, she kept trying to convince herself.\n\n\u201cWe keep opening them one by one,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we can get it to manifest in one single place, and keep that door open, we should be able to leave by another.\u201d\n\nThe sun had started to set outside. For all intents and purposes, this still just looked like a house. The windows were clear, showing the greenery outside. Maybe it was all a lie. Maybe none of it was really happening.\n\nBut looking down at Helen, and her unblinking eyes, I knew it was the realest thing I\u2019d ever experienced.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWe\u2026 there\u2019s three of us,\u201d I said. \u201cFour doors. We can\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s perfect,\u201d nodded Whitney. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 we open all but the front door. It manifests. Then we can get out through the one safe remaining door.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless we all die. There\u2019s nothing that says it can only be in one place.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is implied,\u201d said Whitney. \u201cIf you got a better plan, just tell me. But unless you want to starve to death, we gotta-\u201c\n\n\u201cStarve?\u201d I interrupted. \u201cIs that what\u2026\u201d\n\nI looked back at the study, where Whitney said her father had died. No words were necessary. She took a deep breath and nodded.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t bring himself to try,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we have to ask ourselves what we want. A long but certain death, or a violent risk at life?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe fridge, the freezer, and all the cupboards had been cleared out. Whitney found some raisins for us to share while we pondered what to do. Helen couldn\u2019t eat. She stared blankly ahead, waiting for her mind to come wandering back.\n\nIt was dark outside. Whitney rolled the bronze key between her fingers.\n\n\u201cI wonder how he did it,\u201d she sighed. \u201cHe never made any sense to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d I shrugged. \u201cAt least not to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what made him so special?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he did have a lot of books,\u201d I said, reaching into a pile we\u2019d gathered from the study. \u201cJust look at some of these.\u201d\n\n\u201cAstrology of Abraham, Channels of Esoteric Geometry\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI like this one,\u201d I said, holding up a little red book. \u201cDiary of Emmett Rask.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. But it doesn\u2019t beat the\u2026\u201d\n\nWhitney pulled out another book from the pile, turning it over.\n\n\u201c\u2026 the thirteen faiths of the blameless mother.\u201d\n\nI shook my head, looking over at Helen. A handful of raisins slipped between her fingers. She didn\u2019t even bother closing her hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking back at Whitney, I sighed.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have to try.\u201d\n\nSo we did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe lined ourselves up on the top floor. Helen on the far right, near the bathroom. I was on the far left, by the guest room. Whitney was in the middle, by the bedroom. Helen didn\u2019t understand. She just mimicked us.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna open on three,\u201d said Whitney. \u201cAnd no matter what we see, just run. Run downstairs, and just\u2026 go. Get out.\u201d\n\nI nodded. Helen didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cOne.\u201d\n\nI tightened my grip. I saw Helen follow my lead, giving me an exhausted look. She could barely keep her eyes open.\n\n\u201cTwo.\u201d\n\nI started doubting which way to turn the doorknob. I\u2019d turned a million doorknobs throughout my life, but that was the first time I\u2019d really thought about which way to turn it. I imagined myself hearing water. Bubbles. Distant rumbles. I tried telling myself that it was all imagined. Fake. Tricks of the mind.\n\nBut in my heart of hearts, I knew it wasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThree.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe opened our doors.\n\nAll I saw was a well-made bed. A bag of toiletries; probably Whitney\u2019s. I left the door open and turned around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHelen was smiling as the darkness welcomed her.\n\n\u201cCome on!\u201d Whitney screamed. \u201cLeave her!\u201d\n\nThe door to the bedroom was open. Clear. But I was standing just ten feet away from an endless abyss. Helen looked at it, as if searching for something. She touched the surface with an outstretched hand.\n\n\u201cSeb, honey,\u201d she cried. \u201cSebby, please.\u201d\n\nA pulse shot through her. I could see the hair on her arm stand up. Her veins turning black.\n\n\u201cOh, Sebby\u2026\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn an instant, her flesh unraveled as it flayed itself from the inside out. Her scream stifled as something pulled her in, leaving splotches of blood behind from the outline of her feet. A pained moan escaped her; only to be turned to harmless bubbles in the pressurized void.\n\nWhitney grabbed me by the neck and pulled me downstairs. We ran to the front door. We looked back a final time, just to make sure it was still manifested upstairs.\n\nIt was still there. We\u2019d sacrificed Helen, but we\u2019d make it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhitney pulled the front door open \u2013 and stopped.\n\nDarkness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe\u2019d been wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhitney turned to run as an impossibly long arm grabbed the flesh of her back; straight through her clothes. It pulled her back.\n\nI crawled away, not being able to close my eyes.\n\n\u201cHelp me!\u201d she cried out. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake fucking help me!\u201d\n\nI shook my head, not knowing what to do. I\u2019ll never forget those desperate eyes. The betrayal. The pleading. She fought every inch of the way. She dug her nails into the hardwood floor. She kicked. She pulled. She screamed. But for every second she stayed, the more painful it was.\n\nWith a final snap, the fingers dug into her spine; folding her like a lawn chair.\n\nA lifeless body, dragged across the floor. Unceremoniously pulled into the dark with a quiet squelch.\n\nAnd the door, slightly damaged by Seb and his crowbar, slid shut.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was all alone.\n\nThe door to the guest bedroom and the main bedroom remained open. There was the bathroom and study downstairs. Just two closed doors left; the bathroom and the front door. Both closed. Both\u2026 wrong.\n\nThere was no right answer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI must\u2019ve stayed there for days. I found some trail mix in Whitney\u2019s bag. I had water. I could shower. I had a change of clothes. I scoured the notebooks over and over and over, trying to find the slightest hint on what to do. There had to be some way of knowing for sure. There had to be.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I came across a final note that I realized it was over. It read;\n\n\u201cBy will alone, we cannot make ourselves right. Right is right, independently of our actions and intentions. We cannot control that which never was, and we cannot be part of that which will never be. There could be no more perils for me to face, and yet, I cannot bring myself to leave. There is no certainty in the unknown, and I choose not to live by chance alone.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI cried myself to sleep at night. I banged on the walls. I even tried opening a window, only to have my left eardrum blown out from the pressure drop. Got a nasty nosebleed as well.\n\nI tried reading. I tried making up little worlds in my head. I imagined myself safe and sound.\n\nBut it was useless. In those final hours of desperate loneliness, I knew I couldn\u2019t fool myself any longer.\n\nI was going to die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found myself with my hand on the front door. I learned every crease of the wood. The temperature of the metal handle. I listened to it. Studied it. At times, it was quiet. At other times, it wasn\u2019t. Sometimes I imagined it quiet, other times, I imagined voices coming from the other side.\n\nMaybe I wasn\u2019t imagining it.\n\nFinally, I grasped the bronze key. Starving, exhausted, and mentally broken \u2013 I opened the front door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSunshine.\n\nAnd there, on the fresh-cut lawn, was another realtor.\n\nJust as confused as I was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, turns out I was only in there for about 16 hours total. And to this day, no one seems to remember neither Anders, Seb, Helen, or Whitney. According to every document I can find, the owner of the house had no children. The cars parked outside were unregistered. On paper, it seemed like the entire world had forgotten that these people were ever part of this plane of existence.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s lying here. There was a sincere disbelief and confusion to every piece of my story. To onlookers, I seemed like a squatter that\u2019d gone insane.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to find anything about this. They won\u2019t let me go back to read the notes. The investment firm who owns the real estate company swept it all under a rug and tore the place down. I suspect they were the ones who made the bronze key mysteriously disappear from the evidence room.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to find copies of the books I found in there. Some of them have been seen in passing on strange message boards, and one just keeps making my computer turn off whenever I try to google it. Who the hell is Emmett Rask anyway?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone knew these people, or have heard about this phenomenon, please\u2026 I need to know I\u2019m sane. I need to know this isn\u2019t all a dream. I need to know I won\u2019t wake up with my hand on that front door, having imagined living a life back outside.\n\nThis has to be real. I am real. There is nothing on the other side of the door.\n\nGo ahead, listen. There\u2019s nothing there.\n\nIt can\u2019t be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan it?",

I can't imagine why or how that whole darkness got created except that it seems to me that when Anders crossed the threshold of the study while holding that key it activated that whole black abyss stuff. And then when you were holding the key while opening the front door it seemed to deactivate it. I was thinking the whole time I was reading that that key was \"the key\" (no pun really intended!) to deactivating that which had you trapped there. I think had Whitney had the key when she opened that door, she would've been fine. As for the 2 remaining doors both having the darkness behind it at the same time, the only thing I can figure is because it was on 2 separate floors. Maybe it couldn't be behind 2 doors on the same level at the same time, but it could be behind 2 doors on DIFFERENT levels at the same time...but that probably doesn't even matter anymore because you'll likely never have to face that situation again. Although if I were you I'd probably remove all the doors in my house out of fear!",

That's screwed up of me because I'm extremely claustrophobic but for some reason I seem to enjoy watching stuff that induces my claustrophobia anxiety...as long as I don't actually have to experience the claustrophobia myself I get some sick thrill apparently by experiencing it vicariously... which is why I mess around in the claustrophobic sub. Same reason I watch horror movies I reckon.",

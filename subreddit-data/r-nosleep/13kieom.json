    "postText": "I have no family left now that my ex and my son have cut me out of their lives, so here I am sharing what will likely be my last words, with strangers.\n\nPlease excuse any typos, I\u2019ve never been good with words and I know it\u2019s only a matter of time before I\u2019ll be unable to write anything ever again.\n\nMarla, Nathan, if you\u2019re reading this, I\u2019m sorry for all the pain I\u2019ve caused.\n\nI should\u2019ve paid more attention to the red flags. Maybe if I had, I wouldn\u2019t be holed up in a dark closet in someone's basement surrounded by a puddle of my own blood.\n\nHe had looked so nervous when he showed up unannounced, introducing himself as Dave. He\u2019d studied my house as we walked through to my office, as if trying to memorize each detail.\n\nWhat struck me about him, besides the odd smell that clung to his clothes, was how timid and soft spoken he was. I had to coax him into actually taking a seat and making eye contact with me. Once he did, though, his stare was unnervingly intense, almost predatory.\n\n\u201cI need you to watch my wife.\u201d\n\nI nodded; it was a fairly common request, finding out where the spouse, fianc\u00e9, or significant other was going during the day. What they were doing, and oftentimes, who. It isn\u2019t the most exciting type of job, but it typically pays fairly well and usually ends up being safer than many I\u2019ve taken over the years. After the recent accident and with the new metal rod in my leg, I was all for  something low key.\n\nI laid out the terms of my employment, how much I charge an hour, all of that, as he nodded along, never once breaking eye contact.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your wife\u2019s name?\u201d\n\nHe stood up so abruptly that he knocked his chair over and leered at me, eyes narrowed. I tensed, putting my hands up placatingly \u2013 I thought he might come over the desk.\n\nHe shuddered as if trying to shake himself out of it, and then sat back down.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he laughed nervously, \u201cOf course. Of course, you wouldn\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\nWe sat in silence for a moment. I considered sending him away, but I needed the money and he\u2019d offered to pay the full amount up front \u2013 in cash.\n\nThe downside of the work that I do is that you tend to meet people that while at their worst, while they are desperate, afraid, frustrated. I made a mental note to try and rent out my old space from before the accident, so in the very least I wouldn\u2019t be having these types of meetings in my home.\n\n\u201cWhere do you think she\u2019s going?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to watch her sleep.\u201d\n\nNow that, that gave me pause. Of everything I\u2019d ever been asked to do, something about that made me more anxious.\n\n\u201cIt was her request.\u201d He added, perhaps in response to the concern written on my face.\n\n\u201cAnd *why* does she need someone to watch her sleep?\u201d\n\nHe smiled at me for the first time, a bit too widely. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nI figured that at least she\u2019d been the one to request that I be there, which while still strange, felt less intrusive. At the time I wasn\u2019t sure why he hired me to watch a sleeping woman at a hundred bucks an hour.\n\nWhen that night came, as I sat in my car, I felt my anxiety spike. I\u2019d never done a job like this before in my life, and while strange, it seemed too good to be true. No crouching in bushes, sitting in a hot car for hours on end \u2013 but in the back of my mind I couldn\u2019t shake the image: the momentary crack in Dave\u2019s calm persona, the absolute abhorrence with which he looked at me. It all felt wrong.\n\nI told myself it was fine, I was just on edge after the accident, and did my usual pre-driving ritual:\n\nDeep breath in. Deep breath out. Wait. Start the car.\n\nTheir house looked like your run of the mill colonial from the outside \u2013 well manicured lawn, cheery flowers, baby blue siding, a porch swing.\n\nThe inside, well, the inside was a different story entirely. When Dave opened the door cobwebs floated through the air from where they\u2019d been disturbed, drifting through the pale moonlight. Dust coated nearly every surface I could see. I clutched my light coat to my body to keep from shivering after I stepped inside \u2013 it was a good 30 degrees colder than I kept my own house. The lights were dim, just barely bright enough for me to see where I was going.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the dust, or the dark, or the cold that fazed me, though. It was the smell. From the moment I stepped over the threshold, it hit me. Faint but immensely unpleasant, like meat gone bad.\n\n\u201cChristy is upstairs.\u201d\n\nThe only parts of the house I\u2019d seen so far that weren\u2019t in total disarray, were the pictures plastered along the entry hall. They were all of Dave with a striking blonde woman, his wife Christy, I guessed. He looked so happy in them, a stark contrast to the waxen and grim-faced man I\u2019d come to know.\n\nAs I kept walking, I passed an end table with pictures of just her. Little trinkets were laid out, a woman\u2019s engagement ring, a lock of hair.\n\nI realized what I was looking at.\n\nIt was a shrine.\n\nMy heart pounded at the thought of what I was possibly walking into. As we approached the dark stairwell, the smell intensified. I still don\u2019t know what possessed me to stay.\n\nDave started up the stairs and after a moment, I followed slowly, clutching the banister and making my way up the best I could.\n\n\u201cBad leg?\u201d\n\nI nodded.\n\nBy the time we reached the top, the smell of decay and rot had become so strong that it made my eyes water. As he slowly opened the door to the bedroom, I held my breath \u2013 both to keep the fetid air from my lungs, and also out of anticipation of what I was about to see.\n\nOn the bed, bundled up under blankets, was the woman from the pictures \u2013 Christy. To my immense relief, she was alive, albeit asleep.\n\nThere was a single chair facing the bed, which Dave gestured to.\n\n\u201cCan I get you something to drink?\u201d he asked as I plopped down none too gracefully.\n\nI nodded appreciatively, staring at Christy, still unsure of what was happening and what exactly I was supposed to do. I was surprised when he came back with an entire bottle of whiskey.\n\nI asked if I could take him up on some water instead and he looked me up and down, before walking away again without a word.\n\nAs I stared at the small figure in the bed, pale and delicate looking, blonde hair around her like a halo \u2013 I realized she looked so familiar; I wondered where I\u2019d seen her before.\n\nI only had a moment to ponder that before the bottle struck me in the head. The last thing I remember was the sting as alcohol seeped into the wound, doubling the searing pain.\n\nWhen I awoke, I was in a partially finished basement. I felt the cold cement on my cheek as I opened my eyes to see that Dave was inches from my face, smiling at me. I sat up, woozy. I was near a drain that was flecked with bits of soggy tissue and clumps of hair, and the rancid smell that arose from it hit me in a wave. Blood had stained the concrete \u2013 there was far too much of it to just be my own. I managed to prop myself up and then fought the urge to vomit when I saw that a tuft of black hair \u2013 still attached to the scalp \u2013 had been pinned under my arm and was stuck to my bare flesh.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling the police,\u201d I whispered the empty threat hoarsely \u2013 I doubted I could fish the phone out of my pocket faster than he could do whatever he had planned for me. I highly suspected that he\u2019d just tossed me down both flights of stairs \u2013 my entire body was throbbing with a dull pain that battled the jagged cuts along my head for my attention.\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d His laugh unsettled me, \u201cPlease! Please do that. *Please* tell them how an unlicensed PI is at my home at 3 AM reeking of alcohol. Tell them how you\u2019re here to kill my wife a second time.\u201d\n\n*Jesus.*\n\nI suddenly realized why Christy looked so familiar \u2013 it was only for a moment, but it\u2019s still imprinted on my mind no matter how hard I try to erase it.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t have been behind the wheel. A part of me knew I wasn\u2019t up to driving. I could\u2019ve called a cab, an Uber, but I didn\u2019t.\n\nHer mouth had formed a perfect O; blue eyes wide.\n\nOf course, she was surprised. *She\u2019d* been driving on the correct side of the road; she wouldn\u2019t have expected to suddenly see headlights pointed at her as I barreled down the small highway going 75. Her reflexes were fast but in her panic, she\u2019d swerved too hard in the opposite direction and I\u2019d heard the sound of screeching metal and shattering glass as her car wrapped around a tree.\n\nI made it out without so much as a scratch, it was almost as if I\u2019d never been there at all.\n\nIt was a miracle she\u2019d survived.\n\nBut no \u2013 she hadn\u2019t, I reminded myself. I\u2019d have stuck around if there was any chance she had still been alive. It was too late, I could tell by looking at her car that there was nothing I could do for her \u2013 the news later confirmed my suspicions. Died on the scene. I had a wife, a son, a job, my entire life ahead of me. Later, the guilt and self-loathing would end those relationships anyways, but at the time all I could think of was what I stood to lose if I got caught.\n\n\u201cHow is she\u2026 still here?\u201d I whispered.\n\n\u201cOh, *now* you remember her.\u201d He flashed a bitter smile at me. \u201cShe was my world, Michael, I couldn\u2019t live without her. I found a way where I wouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nI managed to stand, bur found myself backed against a wall, remaining upright was a struggle. Dave continued towards me, unsteady, unhinged.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to really, truly bring someone back. Not completely. No matter what you offer in exchange. She\u2019s not the same. I wanted to go after you as soon as I found you, but Christy \u2013 there used to still be a bit of Christy in there \u2013 she convinced me not to. But you did it again.\u201d He pointed his head accusingly towards my leg.\n\n\u201cNo one else got hurt this time,\u201d I gasped, \u201cNever again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Michael. We just don\u2019t believe you.\u201d\n\nThe floorboards above my head creaked \u2013 something heavy was moving across the floor.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so hungry. It\u2019s been difficult, but when you love someone, you make sacrifices for them.\u201d\n\nI heard her footsteps as she descended the basement stairs. Slow, deliberate.\n\nI looked around frantically, he was between me and the only exit, and the windows were far too tiny for me to fit through. The only place I could hide was in a tiny closet on the finished side \u2013  I slid along the wall in that direction, as he followed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen it a few times by now. It won\u2019t be fast \u2013 it will take days of digestion before you\u2019re truly dead \u2013 but even that is still far faster than you deserve.\u201d\n\nShe leaned forward and peeked her head down at me, grinning, her blond hair a curtain through which her eyes glinted in the scant light. She moved unnaturally and even in the shadows I could see that her skin seemed to be shifting, like whatever was in there was aching to come out.\n\nDave was transfixed as she strode towards us. The look he gave her as she approached was one of sheer adoration, even as what should\u2019ve been flesh and bone began unfurling to reveal a gaping maw.\n\nAs she came close enough that I could see the hundreds of teeth ringing the now fully opened mouth, I swung at Dave blindly.\n\nI seemed to have caught them both by surprise, allowing me to narrowly avoid being pulled into the living darkness that had once been Christy.\n\nInstead, she only caught the lower half of my bad leg \u2013 the distinct feeling of flesh and bone dissolving away hit me instantaneously.\n\nShe began to drag me backwards, I frantically clawed against the rough concrete floor trying to pull myself towards the tiny closet \u2013 nails shredded, fingertips bloody, when I heard a meaty sounding rip and the resistance was finally gone.\n\nI tried to ignore the sound of the exposed bone and metal dragging on cement, tried to stay conscious despite the pain. I managed it just long enough to reach the small dark space, and lock the door from the inside.\n\nThat was hours ago.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t run, but even if I could, there\u2019s no way I could get past them. I hear them on the other side, every so often Dave will whisper to her softly.\n\nI have no doubt that a flimsy door and small piece of metal will be no problem for something like her \u2013 whatever she is. The bits and pieces I've found of others unfortunate enough to have met their end in this same closet, confirms that to me.\n\nI don\u2019t know when she will decide to come for the rest of me \u2013 all I can think about is how any moment now could be my last. I cannot stop vividly picturing what my death will be like at her hands.\n\nThis is not a plea for forgiveness \u2013 I do not deserve it. I just need to tell someone what happened to me. I need someone to know what I did.\n\nI have a feeling that soon, this and a few pieces of indigestible hair, bone, and a metal rod, will be all that [remains of me](https://www.reddit.com/user/JamFranz/comments/11or7ez/hello_and_welcome/).",

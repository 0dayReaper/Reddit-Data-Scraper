    "postText": "This post is the final part of this story. Sorry it has taken so long to get through. And I'm not sure I even understand all of it yet. If you're new, this all started [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/130mkjv/the_s%C3%A9ance_club_an_invitation_to_windhaven_manor/). The previous part (Part 7) is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13po9ag/the_s%C3%A9ance_club_back_inside_windhaven_manor/). Thank you to everyone who followed along.\n\n\\-----\n\n\u201cDo you see her?\u201d I asked in a meek voice.\n\n\u201cYou mean that girl in black?\u201d Harvey answered.\n\nIt was her, in the flesh. Her lips parted and formed a malevolent smile. Her dark eyes fixed on mine. My legs turned to solid lead. My feet refused to move. The anxiousness to reach Parker and Juliet and Beth in the cellar crumbled like the wood turning to ash behind us. She demanded my attention.\n\nA hand rocked my shoulder. Harvey. I pushed him away.\n\n\u201cYou have to go. Help them. I\u2019ll take care of her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d\n\nA mirage of Harvey flitted past Ally and disappeared into the kitchen. Everything blurred, everything but her.\n\nShe tilted her head to one side and bridged the gap between us with four slow and deliberate steps. She pushed her right hand out from a long sleeve and ran the black painted nail of her index finger across my cheek, the smooth lacquer cold against my skin. I shuddered as the chill spread like ice creeping up a window.\n\n\u201cIt is such a shame to be losing you so soon. We\u2019ve only just met, and yet I feel like we\u2019ve known each other our whole lives. Do you feel it too?\u201d\n\nI shook my head. \u201cLet me go.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re past that now Sam. I considered if we could coexist, you and I. It gave me a thrill knowing there is another one out there like me. But you insist on meddling with my work.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean locking all those girls in that filthy dungeon where they met their end? And Jane here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe work is sometimes unpleasant.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the pay is good?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about money Sam. You and I are the same. The pain you felt from not fitting in. The lonely nights lying awake, wishing you could be like everyone else. The stares and the whispers. The rejection from those who are supposed to love us the most. I too know. But where you hid, I searched out a path where my talents were appreciated and rewarded. You don\u2019t hate me Sam. You hate yourself for not thriving like I have.\u201d\n\n\u201cThriving? Is that what you call it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy all measures yes. I am good at what I do. The best. The only. Or so I thought. And then there is you. A na\u00efve, sheltered little boy who can barely put on his own pants in the morning. It is such a shame. And these so-called friends of yours, that was always doomed to failure. Oh and if you harbour any thoughts of them escaping, know that we blocked the little secret entrance the stable boy showed you. There\u2019s no escape except through the fire. When they pick through the ashes of this building they will find their bones, and yours. Is this how you imagined it turning out?\u201d\n\nI flexed the muscles in my legs, but they refused to move. Ally smiled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s useless now Sam.\u201d\n\nI heard the faint whisper of Juliet\u2019s voice in my head. She pleaded with me. Come on Sam, you can do this. I remembered the last encounter with Ally, outside the wall separating Windhaven Manor from the world. Ally had put me in the white room. I had broken free. I had overcome her power once. I had to do it again.\n\nI took a deep breath in through my nose and cried out and willed my feet to move. Electricity coursed through my body and I directed it down to the floor. My left heel separated from the floor and that set the whole thing in motion. The dam burst. I lurched forwards and overbalanced and sprawled to the floor.\n\nAlly crouched beside me and chuckled. \u201cSome would call it a tragedy for a child to die so soon after learning to walk.\u201d\n\nI looked back towards the front of the house. The fire burned hot. Thick black smoke circled up the huge open space of the gallery. Portraits hanging on the wall bubbled and curled as flames consumed them.\n\nA figure appeared at the foot of the staircase. The spectre of Crown. The goons had dragged his lifeless corpse out of the house, but stood before me was the spirit with unfinished business. The ugliness of his actions showed through now in death. His skin was sallow and wrinkled. His head too big for his body and his teeth yellowed. A grotesque monster made worse by his mortal demise.\n\nAlly whispered in my ear. \u201cHe knows it was your meddling that brought about his end. I\u2019ll leave you two alone.\u201d\n\nShe brushed my cheek with the back of her hand and stood. As she walked away leather straps materialised out of thin air and pinned my body to the floor.\n\nThe spectre of Crown grew before me, swelling in size until he had to crouch to stay below the chandelier. He clenched his fists and with burning red eyes let out a guttural growl that skipped my ears and penetrated directly into my skull.\n\nI tried to pull my hands to my ears but they would not come. It made no difference. The roar coming from Crown stabbed the inside of my head like a thousand daggers. I lifted my head and the growl grew to a scream that ricocheted around the inside of my skull. I couldn\u2019t take much more. It felt as though my head would explode.\n\nGuilt bubbled up and mingled with the fear and I shrank into the floor and wished for it to swallow me. They were down there, the only friends I had known, banging against a locked door denying their escape. I sobbed. I sobbed like I had the night my parents turned from me.\n\nIn the pit of my stomach something else grew. A seed of frustration born of a lifetime existing in a world that didn\u2019t make sense. A world where I had no idea who I was and what I could or should do. A world in which I hid. I couldn\u2019t do that now.\n\nJuliet\u2019s voice as clear as day, cutting through the racket of Crown\u2019s scream. Do it Sam. I gritted my teeth and electricity buzzed somewhere deep inside, at first dull and imperceptible, and then amplified and resonating until it peaked into a deafening roar.\n\nAbove Crown the bulbs in the chandelier glowed white. He swivelled his head and watched them dumbly.\n\nI concentrated, felt the energy forming an extra limb. Like the arms and legs of a newborn it flailed spasmodically. I fought to control it, to turn it to my will. I focussed on the straps pinning me to the floor. The electricity fed into the straps and turned them hot. For a moment I feared they would scold my skin, and then in a moment of release they split and flung upwards.\n\nI picked myself up off the floor and faced the spectre of Crown. Like a spent boxer throwing one final punch I threw out my hands and screamed, willing Crown to be quiet and be still. Demanding he be so.\n\nThe floor shook. The dozens of bulbs in the chandelier shattered. The giant spectre of Crown diminished and the screaming inside my head softened until it was no more. Crown\u2019s eyes opened wide as his mouth stitched together and his arms wrenched behind his back. I flicked my hand like I was swatting a fly and Crown flew into the corner of the room and slumped to the floor.\n\nI bent over and rested my hands on my knees. My muscles ached, like I had run a marathon. Shadows played on the floor. I sucked in air and smoke and spluttered and coughed.\n\nIn the hallway the silhouette of Ally. She turned and shook her head. The heat of the fire intensified and crackled at my skin. If we were to make our escape, she could not be here to block us. I straightened and strode towards her.\n\nI cycled furiously through the events of the last few days, searching for something to defeat Ally. I had to do to her what she had done to me. The time for running and breaking her spells was through.\n\nI closed my eyes and concentrated. I stripped away everything except for the two of us. The crackle of the fire replaced with silence. The smell of the smoke disappeared. The heat washed away. One by one I shut down all my senses. When I opened my eyes a monotone room of white. Sterile calm had replaced the burning insides of Windhaven Manor.\n\nHer eyes scanned the room and she giggled. \u201cCheap tricks won\u2019t get you far,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you learned this one from me.\u201d\n\nThe white rippled as if the walls were made of water. She was fighting it. I concentrated, focussing all my energy, all my will. The ripples slowed and then stopped.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fast learner,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have been doing this for more than a weekend.\u201d\n\nStrips of colour permeated the white. A rectangle of tile appeared on the floor. And then some blue from the curtain. Enough of a smouldering wall to let in some smoke. The acrid smell reached my nose and I spluttered. As each wedge of colour appeared, I filled it back in white. But it was a sinking ship and the pail I held to bail out the water would not be enough.\n\nAlly grunted under her breath. A grunt of frustration. The white room shook and made a sound like a train bearing down.\n\nI had to bind her. I raised my palm and coils of rope rose from the ground and oscillated like snakes around her. She swatted them away and wrenched them from the ground and flung them at my feet, limp and unmoving.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be that easy,\u201d she sneered.\n\nMy arms jerked behind my back. She bound my wrists and then my ankles. She pursed her lips and blew as if extinguishing a single candle on a birthday cake, and it was enough to send me to the floor. I couldn\u2019t do this on my own. I needed help.\n\nI shut my eyes and concentrated my energy not on my bindings, but on the woods at the back of Windhaven Manor. On the girls who escaped the dungeon and now roamed the forest, watching the house burn from behind the barrier Ally constructed.\n\nI fed the energy coursing through my body into the giant snowdome structure until it burned hot and then like the globes in the chandelier, it cracked and exploded into the night sky. The spirits of the girls watched the shards disappear and then strode towards the Manor.\n\nI turned my attention to the tiny room beside the pantry, where Jane Laughlin lay bound to the bed. I stood beside her and lay my hand on the shackles binding her to the bed. She shuddered as the mask came free from her mouth and then stood as the shackles broke.\n\nI opened my eyes and the white of the room flickered off and then back on again like bad reception on a television. I had to keep the white walls up long enough for them to draw near. For them to be ready when the fa\u00e7ade fell. Ally strode towards me, exuding confidence.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t beat me Sam.\u201d\n\nAlly squeezed her hands into fists and screamed. In a burst of energy she wiped the white room clear and we were back in the burning house. The air was thick with smoke. Behind me a timber beam tumbled from the ceiling and crashed to the floor. The heat and smoke sucked the moisture from my insides and I heaved out a series of coughs.\n\nAlly opened her eyes and smiled. She had bested me. But then they came. The girls from the dungeon and Jane Laughlin surrounded her. The sum total off all the pain and hurt inflicted in this place. Everything Ally had worked to keep hidden from the world.\n\nThey lurched at Ally. She raised her hands and pushed them back one by one as they went for her. She spun on the spot, trying to keep them at bay. She could not hold them all back. The sheer weight of numbers overwhelmed. They leaned in and pushed their heads into hers and showed her what those men had done. Made her feel it. The fear and despair and anger of each individual stacked together and Ally crumpled to the floor holding her head.\n\n\u201cMake it stop,\u201d she said.\n\nThey kept at her.\n\nJane Laughlin sidled over to the base of the stairs where Crown sat, bound and with his mouth stitched. She considered him, restrained and helpless on the floor as she had been. He fought with his restraints, and then whimpered, as she had. As I ran for the pantry and the wine cellar, the corridor filled with the muffled sound of his screams.\n\nThe door to the cellar stood open and I made the descent of the stairs in three leaps. The enclosed space already full with smoke. At the end of the long corridor leading outside, Parker and Harvey shouldered the door. Juliet and Beth screamed encouragement. The door would not budge.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go that way,\u201d I yelled.\n\nThey raced back up the long corridor. A sudden rush of emotion bubbled up to the surface. I was so happy to see them all still alive. My lower jaw rattled and my hands shook. I fought to hide it.\n\nBeth reached me first. \u201cSam, you\u2019re ok.\u201d\n\nI blubbered a response and took in a lung full of smoke. We had to get out.\n\nThe fire raged outside the kitchen door. A wave of flame climbed up and spread across the ceiling. A subtle cracking sound from above intensified and a chunk of the upstairs floor came crashing down through the ceiling, blocking the rear door. We couldn\u2019t get out the back. The only way now was back through the house. A ball of flame whooshed through the doorway and I put my arm up too late, my eyebrows wilting in the heat.\n\nWe crouched together in the middle of the kitchen, lowering our heads to get the last of the remaining oxygen. Malicious red flames and choking black smoke surrounded us on all sides.\n\n\u201cWhere do we go now?\u201d Parker\u2019s words came out between coughs. Tears streaked down his cheeks. Soot covered his brow. I wished I had an answer.\n\nThen he was there, standing over Parker\u2019s shoulder. Leon. With the protective bubble gone, he too was free to come in the Manor.\n\n\u201cThe fire has not yet consumed the dining room. But you don\u2019t have long.\u201d\n\nI looked vaguely in the direction of the kitchen door and blinked back the stinging from the smoke. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can find it in this.\u201d\n\n\u201cFollow me.\u201d\n\nI pulled my shirt up over my head. \u201cWe have to go. The dining room, we can make it. All together on three.\u201d\n\nI shouted out the numbers, the sound drowned out by the roar of the fire. I grabbed Beth\u2019s hand and yanked her into action. Leon led the way and I kept my eyes on his heels. Together we were a flurry of arms and legs bounding for the dining room. I gritted my teeth against the heat. We burst through the doorway and everything turned orange.\n\nFrom below the sweater pulled tight down over my hair, I shot a glance over to the floor of the grand gallery where I had left Ally writhing on the floor. She was not there now. Nor were the spectres of the girls.\n\nI followed Leon\u2019s heels into the dining room. The great wooden table smouldered in the centre of the room. Brilliant orange flames consumed the thick curtains. Parker spotted his camera still atop the tripod and set to pulling the camera free before Harvey grabbed his arm and yelled something that sounded like \u2018leave it\u2019.\n\nHarvey grabbed one of the heavy chairs with their high backs and velvet cushions and heaved it at the window in the back corner of the room. The chair disappeared into the darkness of the night and Harvey kicked at the glass shards left behind. Parker joined. We piled out the opening.\n\nI drank in the fresh cool air of night, staggering over the narrow path beside the house and to the small strip of grass beyond. Parker collapsed beside me and pulled the laptop out from under his shirt. He tapped at the casing and for a moment a brief smile flashed across his face, but it did not last long. He wiped soot and sweat from his face with shaking hands.\n\nHarvey checked us all in turn, like a parent fussing over their children. We had scrapes and bruises and our skin was red and raw, but we were alright. We had survived. He ran to the front of the house and came back with palms held out by his sides. The man in the black suit, the goons Ponytail and Beanie, and Ally were all gone, along with the black van and the BMW.\n\nHuddled together, we watched the fire consume Windhaven Manor, bright reds and oranges lighting up the windows and thick black smoke tumbling into the purple haze of sky. It was almost morning, the horizon signalling the coming of the sun.\n\nLeon stood apart on the grass. I went to him.\n\n\u201cThank you for coming back for us.\u201d\n\nHe shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s something. It isn\u2019t enough to make up for the rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou saved our lives. And those girls, they had their chance to meet their tormentors. That\u2019s something too.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cWhat happens now?\u201d\n\nI turned my head sideways. \u201cI\u2019m still learning how all this works.\u201d\n\nThe red of the fire reflected in his eyes. \u201cMe too. I might go for a walk in the woods. I always liked it out there.\u201d\n\nHe glided across the lawn and entered the trees and was gone.\n\nThe sound of sirens fought with the crackle of the fire. The fire brigade and the police. I got to my feet and shuffled to the front of the Manor. The burnt out carcasses of our cars stood by the low height wall. Black soot smudged the stone fa\u00e7ade above the windows and the doors.\n\nBy the oak tree on the ocean side of the house stood Jane Laughlin. She peered down into a hole dug at the base of the tree. A pale and withered hand poked up out of the dirt. Her hand. They had meant to remove the body, but had aborted the task and fled.\n\nA fire truck appeared at the head of the driveway and then another. They sped down the gravel and came to a sliding stop. A lone police car followed. Harvey sidled over.\n\nJane looked to the horizon. Out on the cliff edge stood a figure in a red dress. She recognised her sister Kylie immediately and ran down the slope. The two sisters embraced in the first light of the sun. I turned to the whoosh of water through a hose from the fire trucks and when I turned back, the Laughlin sisters were gone.\n\nThe members of The S\u00e9ance Club, which I now consider myself a part, sat together on the low-height stone wall as the firefighters extinguished the flames consuming Windhaven Manor. The house was quiet now. The nausea and vibration I had felt that first night replaced with calm.\n\nThe police stripped the compound clean for the best part of a week. They identified Kyle the sketch artist and Hugo from the teeth that survived the fire of the hovel built over the dungeon. Hugo\u2019s wife lay on the back lawn where Beanie and Ponytail had left her. But as to specific evidence of the crimes that occurred, they could not find enough to put a case together.\n\nThe two fires and the disappearance of Crown made some headlines, but there wasn\u2019t enough to hang anyone else. The police claimed publicly that there was no link between the fire at Windhaven Manor and the fire at the squalid residence over the back fence. At Harvey\u2019s behest they searched the area with cadaver dogs for the remains of the girls, but they found nothing.\n\nParker turned his laptop over to the police. They identified the two goons, Ponytail and Beanie, low level thugs who had disappeared from the streets years earlier. Those in the know presumed them dead. It made tracing them almost impossible. Tracing their vehicles lead to a dead end.\n\nThe man in black the suit on the other hand might as well be a ghost. On him they found nothing. They have a face, but nothing else.\n\nAs for Ally, the girl somehow managed to always turn her face away from the cameras, as if she knew where they were.\n\nI sat in a small room at the police station for three days with Harvey putting the pieces together. He showed me a photograph of an old and gaunt man with a bent back, the last owner of Windhaven Manor before it was sold after his death. He had to be the man with the bent back from the ceremony in the dungeon, but I could not be certain. I never saw his face. Of the faces I did see, we knew Crown and Kyle and Hugo, but the others were harder to pinpoint.\n\nAt the end of it all Harvey sighed. There was nothing more we could do. But we could rest on the knowledge that the key players in the ceremony were all now dead.\n\nQuestions nagged at me. Where was Ally and what was she doing? Would she try to find me? Who was she working for?\n\nThat was the biggest question of all. Who was at the top and pulling the strings? Harvey wasn\u2019t giving up. He was a dog with a bone at the best of times, and now he had a taste of blood. He refused to go back to the police even after Crown\u2019s departure, which he described as the removal of a cancerous limb.\n\nHarvey called me after the dust settled on everything. I told him that the trail had gone cold and I had no idea where Ally was. For all I knew she had evaporated into thin air. Harvey thought it unlikely, and I agreed. He told me it was time for some old-fashioned detective work. The names of the goons would be a start.\n\nAnd there was something else Harvey mentioned, something that I had almost forgotten. He had always believed that his investigation into the disappearance of the girls was the reason one of his colleagues was murdered. Crown confirmed as much in the bedroom right before he was shot. Harvey thinks there is something to it. Another thread to pull, and he has a hunch. For now he\u2019s keeping his cards close to his chest until he has some proof. I almost pressed him on the issue but decided I\u2019d rather put it all behind me.\n\nThe story made headlines in the local press for a while, but ultimately it fizzled into a non-story, quickly forgotten by a public with a short attention spans. We all waited for a reckoning from within the police ranks, but it never came. Harvey predicted that\u2019s the way it would go, and he was proven right.\n\nThe one item they did recover was a gold necklace with a heart pendant. The necklace Jane Laughlin wore the night of her death. The police found it where the black van had parked. After a few days in the possession of the police, Harvey arranged to have the necklace released to the family of its former owner.\n\nThe following day Mr. and Mrs. Laughlin appeared on the local news, thanking the efforts of those who recovered the remains of their daughter. It was closure, though not the kind they had hoped for. Both their girls were dead.\n\nA week later The S\u00e9ance Club convened in Beth\u2019s apartment. Parker and Juliet were already there when I arrived. It was cathartic to talk about the events at Windhaven Manor, to compare stories and scars. I guess that\u2019s why they have the saying about a problem shared.\n\nAfter a brief silence, Beth asked, \u201cAre you going to talk to the parents of Jane and Kylie?\u201d\n\nI shook my head. \u201cWhat will I tell them?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat their daughters found each other out by the cliff edge.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what about the agony of their deaths? Should I tell them that too? Besides, it doesn\u2019t feel right. None of this feels right to me yet. And what weight do my words hold over those of some Priest talking about how he knows their souls are at rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you really do know.\u201d\n\nI shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t prove any of it.\u201d\n\nTruth was I had no idea how to integrate the things I could see and do into my life. From childhood all I had wanted was to be like everyone else. For people not to stare or whisper as I walked by. To find acceptance. Sitting with my three new friends at Beth\u2019s tiny kitchen table, with our shared experience behind us, I finally had it. This could be the start of something.\n\nParker was already planning the next S\u00e9ance Club trip. An abandoned farm up north with mysterious sightings going back centuries. Juliet was already on board. I told them to wait. I couldn\u2019t jump back in right away.\n\nI was the last to leave, Beth and I sipping mug after mug of coffee and sharing comfortable silence. When I sighed and told her I should go, she grabbed my arm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a real family, and then I found Juliet and Parker. The S\u00e9ance Club became my family. Whatever happens we are there for each other. And we mean it when we say we want you to join.\u201d\n\nI thought about that all night, unable to sleep.\n\nThe next morning I called Parker.\n\nAn abandoned farm up north you say?\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nI navigated to the narrow alley and checked the time. The Exchange should be open. It looked out of context in the Saturday morning light. No bright light spilling from the window. No surge of Friday night after work traffic.\n\nI slipped in the front door. A lone man lifted upturned stools down from the bar. He had his back to me and I crept across the hardwood floor in the direction of the stairs down and the bathrooms.\n\nThe vibration swelled in my chest, but I did not fear it. A dull pain rose in the base of my skull, but I gritted my teeth. A man wearing a pair of rough leather shoes came from the other end of the corridor and stopped before me.\n\n\u201cAre you here to help?\u201d\n\nI nodded.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/SleeplessFromSundown/comments/y3ngzo/welcome_message/)",

    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n If you need to catch up, you can do so [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/144j9wi/i_work_at_a_small_town_mcdonalds_my_manager_makes/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of college kids stumbled in, trying to hide the fact that they were obviously stoned out of their minds, and retrieved a pickup order. I watched as they clumsily staggered out the door. One of them held it politely for a small old lady. An old lady wearing a shawl. She didn\u2019t utter so much as a thank you, beelining up to the register with purpose. I was exhausted, up well past my normal operating hours, so I had completely forgotten about the rules. Big mistake.\n\nThe woman glowered up at me, face obscured from view. Her head covering was black as well as the rest of her outfit, not unlike a ninja you\u2019d see in a movie. The aura she radiated frightened me, but not enough to release me from my sleepy haze. \n\n\u201cHello, how can I help you?\u201d I yawned, lazily covering my mouth.\n\nThe woman didn\u2019t move a muscle. She scowled at me, yellow reptilian eyes piercing my psyche and sending my heart into overdrive. \n\n\u201cMa\u2019am? Would you like to order something?\u201d\n\nNothing. The longer we continued our staring match, the more sedated I felt, and not just due to the lack of sleep. She had some sort of strange pull over me. I nearly nodded off, my mind wandering back to the instructions. \n\nBefore I passed out, I murmured, \u201cwhere\u2019s Tony?\u201d\n\nSuddenly, I was released from my trance and the woman was nowhere to be found. Like she had simply vanished into thin air. My eyes widened. That was close. Too close. I trudged to the sink and splashed some cool water in my face, then poured myself a large cup of coffee. I knew it would probably keep me up well past closing, but hey, if it helped me avoid another incident like that, I was all for it. \n\nI had just finished dumping the dustpan into the trash when I felt it. A peculiar sensation crept over me like bugs crawling on the back of my neck. I was being watched. But from where? I sensed it coming from the drive thru. I whipped my head in its direction. Empty. It shifted to the dining area. No one was there. I grew lightheaded and panic began to surge through my system. A breeze swept past my ear, and I swear I could hear a soft almost imperceptible voice whisper, \u201cBlair.\u201d \n\nI bolted to the office, slamming the door shut as quickly as I could. What *was* that? I paced around the office like a caged animal, anxiously waiting for something, anything to happen. After what felt like an eternity, it began to dissipate without incident. I sat there for a moment, contemplating if this was really the right career path for me. \n\nWas every night like this? I was snapped back to reality by static emanating from my headset. I ripped it off until the noise stopped. A bumbling male voice crackled through it. \n\n\u201cHey, uh, is this place open?\u201d he slurred, obviously under the influence.\n\n\u201cYeah. What do you want to order?\u201d\n\nI was beginning to lose my cool. Between all the strange occurrences and the inebriated customers, my patience was wearing thin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have a filet-o-fish meal.\u201d\n\n\u201cComing right up.\u201d\n\nI made my way back to the kitchen and began preparing his order. \n\n\u201cWho the hell comes to McDonald\u2019s at one-thirty in the morning for a freaking filet-o-fish?\u201d I grumbled, purposely dousing his sandwich in sauce. \n\nI served the man, hoping to be rid of him as soon as possible. \n\n\u201cThanks. Hey, is that a kid at the counter?\u201d\n\nI turned my head and sure enough, there he was. A mess of blonde tangles and deep blue eyes peered at me from the register. I sighed. \n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll take care of him. Have a good night.\u201d\n\nA child. Unaccompanied in my restaurant. Just what I needed. I began to approach the counter when rule seven blared in my mind like a tornado siren. I froze mid-stride. \n\n\u201cJust ignore him, Blair. It\u2019s almost two. You got this,\u201d I reassured myself, starting my closing duties early. \n\nThat was easier said than done. The child began wailing, shrill high-pitched screams reverberating off the walls. He ran into the kitchen area, allowing me a full view of his tiny frame. The boy couldn\u2019t have been older than six. His Pac-Man T-shirt looked well outdated, and he was filthy, as if he hadn\u2019t showered in years. He began tugging on my shirt, begging for attention. \n\n\u201cPlease help me, lady. I can\u2019t find my mommy,\u201d he cried, tears streaming down his rosy cheeks. \n\nHe was relentlessly pulling at my clothing. That was it. I\u2019d reached my breaking point. If this child, monster, demon, whatever he was, planned on killing me, he could go ahead and put me out of my misery. I was done. \n\n\u201cGet out! Just screw off and leave me the hell alone!\u201d \n\nHe immediately quit sniffling and straightened up as if I\u2019d flipped a switch. Red tinged his striking pupils. Dread began sinking into my gut. A malicious grin blossomed across his lips. \n\n\u201cYou made the right choice,\u201d he growled as he headed toward the exit. \n\n\u201cWeirdo kid,\u201d I mumbled, returning to cleaning. \n\nI finished up and waited around for two to hit, praying for a quiet, uneventful end to my first nightmare closing shift. Of course, my prayers went unanswered. I had a mere three minutes until I was supposed to clock out when I spotted it. A dark red viscous liquid oozing from beneath the stove. \n\n\u201cGreat. Awesome. Just what I needed.\u201d\n\nI filled up a mop bucket in the storage closet and began sopping up the mystery fluid. If it wasn\u2019t blood, you could\u2019ve fooled me. A persistent copper taste assaulted my tongue every time I opened my mouth. I gagged, forcing vomit back down my throat. The stuff just wouldn\u2019t stop coming. On my third bucket-full of sloshing crimson, I finally started gaining an upper hand. \n\nI mopped fervently as blisters erupted across my hands from the friction of the wooden handle. All the not-blood had been disposed of. I breathed a sigh of relief, careful to avoid splashing myself as I dumped the last of it down the drain. I\u2019d done it. \n\n\u201cTake that, bitches! I win!\u201d I cheered as if I\u2019d just claimed first prize at the Indy 500. \n\nMy celebration was short-lived once I glanced down at my phone. 2:35 A.M. I bolted to the freezer, scooping up a couple bags of frozen patties. I slashed them open as quickly as I could, hoping in vain that I\u2019d be able to make it out in time. I dumped their contents on the grill, then turned to toss the packaging in the trash. My heart plummeted into my gut. \n\nA man stood before me. His black dead eyes matched that of the small mask encompassing the top half of his face. Wispy red hair sprouted from his floppy hat. A matching tattered black and white striped uniform framed his features, accompanied by a dingy red tie dotted with images of burgers. He grinned at me, jagged rotten teeth sending a chill undulating through my entire body. He spoke, a rough gravelly voice shattering the tense silence. \n\n\u201cLook, I know you\u2019re new here, so I\u2019ll spare you *this* time. But if I ever catch you in here this late again, I won\u2019t think twice about increasing my calorie intake.\u201d\n\nHis wicked smile exuded a malevolent hunger that still haunts my nightmares. A wet gray tongue wormed its way around his cracked withered lips. I felt like a mouse about to be devoured by a rattlesnake. He scowled at me. \n\n\u201cWhat are you still doing here? *GET OUT!\u201d* \n\nI suddenly regained my mobility. I tore through the dining area and burst into the cool night air. The Hamburglar\u2019s soulless stare followed me into the vacant parking lot. I hurriedly locked him inside and raced to my car as a torrent of emotions flooded through me at once. Fear, anger, and confusion were all prominent on my desolate drive home. In the end, rage won out.\n\nI wasn\u2019t scheduled the next day, but I was determined to make that smug prick in charge at *least* give me some sort of explanation. I returned to the golden arches around four hours later running on zero sleep and a whole pot of Maxwell House. With fire in my eyes, I flung the door open and marched straight to Dave\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah, it was great. Had his car repossessed and everything. Oh, hey Blitz. Uh huh. Yep. I-\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the last freaking time, it's Blair! B-L-A-I-R. Not Blitzen, not Blaziken, not Blakely. *BLAIR.\u201d*\n\nDave furrowed his brow, mouth slightly agape. \n\n\u201cYeah Jim, I\u2019ll have to get back to you.\u201d\n\nHe ended the call and furiously pocketed his phone.\n\n\u201cDo you even know who that was? I mean, why the *hell* do you think you can just storm into my office like this-\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you listen to me, Davey boy. I just had the worst night of my life. Every weird thing that could\u2019ve happened, happened. And you don\u2019t care one bit.\u201d \n\n\u201cI see you\u2019ve become acquainted with our more\u2026 troublesome clientele.\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah. I have. And I\u2019m not dealing with that crap again. I quit,\u201d I hissed, dramatically slapping my hat onto his polished cedarwood desk before turning to walk out the door.\n\n\u201cWait! Twenty-five an hour.\u201d\n\nI stopped dead in my tracks. I reluctantly faced him. A sly toothy grin was stamped on his greasy face. I mulled it over. That was almost double what I was currently making. I could have my college paid for in no time. \n\n\u201cTwenty-seven and you\u2019ve got a deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou drive a hard bargain, Mrs. *Blair.* I accept,\u201d he said, extending his hand. \n\nI begrudgingly shook it, cringing as his sweaty palm gripped mine. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you were able to see reason. Welcome to the night crew.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n [SR](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorJunkie123/)",

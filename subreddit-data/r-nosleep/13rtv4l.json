    "postText": "Editor's note: These records have been revised from an earlier version to remove all identifying information. I sincerely apologise for the amount of identifying information in an earlier release. \n\nOn January 28, 2022, officers entered 21 JXXXXXX AXXXX after a woman related to the residents expressed concerns about their wellbeing.\n\nThey discovered the body of a 34 year old man lying in the upstairs bedroom. He\u2019d been dead for about 37 hours. In the hallway just outside the doorway of the bedroom where we found the older victim, we found the body of a 10 year old boy. He was understood to be the older victim\u2019s son. He died a few hours after his father.\n\nThe cause of death is seemingly natural. A trace amount of codeine and xanax was found in the older victim\u2019s system, but it appeared his death was caused by a sort of infection of the lungs which led him to asphyxiate.\n\nHis son appears to have died in the same manner. This infection is not explained but may have been caused by the unidentified substances we found in the walls.\n\nThe older victim also has some blunt force injuries to his spine consistent with being hit in the back with some sort of blunt object, although this doesn\u2019t seem to have contributed to his death. Human teeth were found within the victim's back, they were seemingly pushed into his flesh when he was hit and some were crushed in the impact. The teeth do not belong to either of the victims.\n\nThe deaths are a medical rarity. The substance we found in the walls is not a match to any existing medical phenomenon, and is in the process of being tested to examine the danger it could cause.\n\nIn an attempt to understand the symptoms, we have collected transcripts from the older victim\u2019s phone (number used is 077XXX XXX) We could not locate other electronic devices from the home as they had mostly been damaged by the unidentified substance we found in the walls.\n\n========\n\n\u200b1/12/22 10:59am Sent by: (private number) Sent to: 077XXX XXX\n\nHi, Michael. It\u2019s Helena.\n\nWe\u2019ve been trying to reach you on the phone but you haven\u2019t picked up. This is about Brian. He\u2019s in the office right now. He is deeply distressed and I think it's best that he goes home. I\u2019m not sure exactly what has happened. I know you\u2019re at work but please get back to me as soon as you can.\n\n========\n1/12/22 11:03am \n\nSent by: 07XXX XXX Sent to: 07XXXX XXX\n\nBrian, tell me what\u2019s going on.

This is Michael, I mean, you know that. I just remembered how you said you don\u2019t save all of the numbers on your phone. (Sighs)\n\nI guess I haven\u2019t been totally honest with you, Sasha. I\u2019m not\u2026 well. I have a son and I never told you. He\u2019s\u2026 er\u2026 he\u2019s 10 years old. His name\u2019s Brian. I didn\u2019t tell you because\u2026 honestly, Brian\u2019s been through a lot. I didn\u2019t really want him to have to meet you because\u2026 I don\u2019t mean it like that.\n\nBrian\u2019s mum, my, um, my wife. Not\u2026 we never got divorced. My wife is\u2026 um\u2026\n(Pause)\n\nOkay. I\u2019ve got to go now and I\u2019d, uh, I\u2019d like you to delete my number.\n\n=========\n\n1/15/22 14:41pm \n\nSent by: 077XXX XXXXX Sent to: 077XXX XXXXX\n\nHey mum I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore. It\u2019s starting to get too much with Brian. I just left work early to go pick him up from school because he had a meltdown. He said he was in class and he looked down under his desk and saw his mother\u2019s face was on the floor. Apparently, it was in perfect condition, as when she was alive. He said that she spoke to him, that she said \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t touch me, no matter how much you want to\u201d Obviously he got scared and stamped on it. He said he saw her face be destroyed when he did that, he told me he saw blood splatter, that he saw her teeth scatter all over the floor. I don\u2019t know how a 10 year old boy could imagine such a thing. I asked him what he saw when he looked down afterwards, he said he saw a face completely caved in.\n\nI guess I should take him back to the therapist like I did when Stacie first passed away. I\u2019ve just never believed in that stuff, that a kid who\u2019s going through terrible things should just talk to some strange adult and that should make them feel any better. I was scared of them giving him pills like they did with me. You remember how sluggish I was, I didn\u2019t even feel like a person. I wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone but with Brian I\u2019m scared. This isn\u2019t normal, and if he continues to see things like this, I don\u2019t even know what will happen.\n\n(note: this text was forensically recovered as 077555 23454 deleted this text about 49 seconds after sending it)\n\nSent by: 077XXX XXXXX Sent to: 077XXX XXXXX\n\nDid you send me a text just now? I got a notification but I can\u2019t see any text from you.\n\nIs this about Brian? Helena told me something happened with him at school. The first thing you should have done is texted me. You aren\u2019t good at handling these things yourself.\n\nSent by: 077XXX XXXXX Sent to: 077XXX XXXXX\n\nI\u2019ve got it under control. I\u2019m more capable than you think.\n\nSent by: 077XXX XXXXX Sent to: 077XXX XXXXX\n\nYes I\u2019m continuously blown away by your wonderful parenting skills (eye roll emoji) You know you need help and you\u2019re too bullheaded to take it.\n\nWhat actually happened at school that day?\n\nSent by: 077XXX XXXXX Sent to: 077XXX XXXXX\n\nBrian thought he saw his mum, basically and he got scared.\n\nYou can\u2019t act like he\u2019s crazy for it, can you?\n\n============\n\nEditor\u2019s note: We thought this seemed significant so we sent an investigator to the boy\u2019s school to learn more about this incident. We conducted interviews with the headteacher and a few other staff members.\n\nOur findings was that several staff members reported finding a small amount of blood under the boy\u2019s desk after his outburst. They reported it \u2018wasn\u2019t nearly enough blood to think anything of\u2019 and believed it was most likely from a papercut or similar.\n\nOne witness reported that they did find a tooth on the floor that day but didn\u2019t question it too much as in a primary school sometimes children lost teeth. Asked if they believed it was the victim\u2019s tooth, he said he wasn\u2019t sure as it had been found a few feet from his desk and was under another desk. We asked if it looked adult, no conclusive response.\n\n===========\n\n1/16/22 15:10pm \n\nSent by: 077XXX XXXXX Sent to: 077XXX XXXXX\n\nHi, I don\u2019t know if you remember me. I\u2019m Michael. We met on Hinge, months ago now. I\u2019m aware you probably deleted my number but I\u2019m the guy who has a son, I guess. I didn\u2019t have it in my profile but I told you that night. You seemed cool with it, but looking back you were probably just being polite. I get it and everything but politeness is a plague really. I\u2019d like to wring the neck of whoever came up with the concept of being polite. I think politeness is why we\u2019re the only species that has problems.\n\nI guess I\u2019m messaging you again desperate for your empathy or somebody\u2019s empathy. It\u2019s not that simple as me just having a son or having an ex. My wife is dead and that\u2019s one hell of a burden to bear not because of her but because of him. He\u2019ll never be the same and he\u2019ll never really be okay. My son was the one who found the body, and he saw her face. I didn\u2019t see her face. I don\u2019t know if seeing a thing like that is something you can ever get over. I do try my best but I guess it's getting worse for him.\n\nI really hope you'll get back to me. I don\u2019t expect anything from you romance-wise. I promise. I just want someone to talk to. Will you talk to me?\n\n==========\n1/18/22 13:51pm \n\nSent to: 077XXX XXXXX Sent by: 077XXX XXXXX\n\nMichael, I\u2019ve had just about enough of you. I\u2019ve watched you neglect yourself long enough and I don\u2019t want to see you neglect your son as well.\n\nYour son came to my house in hysterics. He told me he didn\u2019t want to be at home because he could see faces in the walls. He said that he heard them speaking to him. He said they told him not to touch them or something bad would happen.\n\nI don\u2019t know how, as a father, you can hear a 10 year old boy say this and continue to think this is okay and that he doesn\u2019t need help.\n\nLet me lay this out in front of you clearly. You either seek out mental help for Brian or I sue you for custody, which I\u2019ve thought about doing even back when your wife was alive.\n\n===========\n\n1/18/22 13:47pm Sent by: (private number) Sent to: 077XXX XXXXX\n\nThis is the GXXXXX child and adolescent mental health service, we have recieved your request. You will be connected with a provider soon. Please provide the name and date of birth of the patient you would like to refer, and a short paragraph describing why you believe they need our help.\n\nSent to: (private number) Sent by: 077XXX XXXXXX\n\nHi, the patient I want to refer is my son Brian XXXXXXX born 5/6/2013.\n\nSo my son recently lost his mother in August 2021. His mum died of a lung infection nobody knew she had overnight. I was out that night, so my son was the one who found her in the morning. I\u2019ll never be able to take back the guilt I feel over that. What I know is that he was with the body for about 8 hours before I got home, because for whatever reason he didn\u2019t want to just call me.\n\nSo Brian is starting to say that he sees faces, maybe his mother\u2019s face, sticking out of the floor and the walls. He first saw it in school. He saw his mother\u2019s face sticking out from the floor under his desk, looking as if she was alive. She told him not to touch her, no matter how much he wanted to. But he got scared and stomped on her face. He said then he saw blood and teeth splatter on the floor, and he looked down to see her face caved in.\n\nI\u2019ll admit I brushed that under the rug, but now I think it\u2019s impossible to ignore. My son wakes up in the night screaming, and he\u2019ll tell me he saw a face sticking out of his wall and sticking out of the ceiling. He says the faces always say to him \u2018don\u2019t touch me no matter how much you want to\u2019. They tell him that something bad will happen to us if he touches them, but he says he has touched them to try to get them to stop.\n\nMy mother says he needs mental help so here I am referring to you.\n\nSent by: (private number) Sent to: 077XXX XXXXX\n\nWe have attempted to reach out to you regarding your request. Please confirm you are still interested in a referral?\n\n=========\n\n1/19/22 10:01am Sent by: (private number) Sent to: 077XXX XXXXX\n\nHi, this is Helena.

Speaks: no. in my room, under bed, speaks: has spoken, not consistently. in Brian\u2019s room, ceiling above bed. Speaks: constantly. Stacie.\n\n======\n\nEditor\u2019s note: this is very significant. We found that in the kitchen, the oven had been pulled to the other side of the room. The wall behind the oven had been hit with a hammer or similar, causing a dent in the drywall. Further, pieces of drywall were discovered under both victim\u2019s fingertips.\n\nUnder the older victim\u2019s bed, the floor is wooden. He had hit the floorboards here with a hammer, and a small amount of his blood was found on the floorboards. Splinters of varying sizes from the floorboards were found in his hands.\n\nThe locations on the ceilings had not been damaged in the same manner. There has been no damage at all to the ceiling in the bathroom. In the younger victim\u2019s room, a towel had been nailed onto the ceiling. There is a hole ripped in the centre of the towel, seemingly ripped with teeth.\n\n=======\n1/27/22 21:00pm \n\nSent by: 077XXX XXXXX Sent to: 077XXX XXXXX\n\nIs everything okay?

From this texts, we can glean that the substance in the walls had caused a lung infection in both victims that gave them trouble breathing and caused them to exhibit psychotic symptoms through the period of infection, which is about 2 months.\n\nThe substance we pulled from the walls for testing was a substance with a chalk-like consistency. There was about 0.55mg of this substance in the walls/ceilings of each location noted by the victim. We also found trace amounts of the substance within the victim\u2019s lungs. Results have found this substance contains human DNA, but it\u2019s unsure exactly what in this substance was toxic to the victims, or how it originated in the house.\n\nWe attempted to test the substance on animals. We inserted traces of the substance into the walls of a wooden structure that we kept two lab mice in. We inserted a small camera to note the effects but after 10 hours, the substance had damaged the camera. We found that one mouse had been killed by its companion. The dead mouse\u2019s back had been viciously mutilated with bite marks and the surviving mouse had the dead mouse's blood all over its fur and teeth. As like the original victims, the mice had seemingly attempted to tear the substance out of the walls.\n\nWhatever this substance is, it is extremely dangerous to any living creature and may possibly appear in other homes near where the first victims died. We believe that more testing should be done on humans to get a better picture on the effects on different individuals. A clinical trial is to be undertaken and test subjects are being sought.",

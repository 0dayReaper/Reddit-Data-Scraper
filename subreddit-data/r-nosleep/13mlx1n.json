    "postText": "It feels much longer than a week since [I first accidentally stumbled across Sauna Club](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13lnhu2/sauna_club_part_one/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). \n\nAll I wanted to do was lose a bit of weight...Now someone's dead, someone's missing and I'm about to break the law...again.\n\nI started and finished the day alone. \n\nAfter dreaming about Sak\u2019s hideous death in that strange between world, I\u2019d woken with a start and rolled over to feel for my wife, to place a hand on bump where her child was growing. But she wasn\u2019t there. Again.\n\nShe\u2019s always been a bit of a workaholic. For a while it was something I really admired about her. It was something I thought might have slowed down since we\u2019re expecting but I guess she stayed out again last night, \u201csave the commute\u201d.  \nThat\u2019s fine. I suppose. Saves me explaining where I\u2019m going. She wouldn\u2019t have believed me if I\u2019d told her about the sauna\u2026and if she had she wouldn\u2019t have understood. How can you find the words to explain something that isn\u2019t, that shouldn\u2019t be possible in a rational world. But even the secret feels like cheating.\n\nWhen I arrived at the gym there was no doubt that my dream was something more\u2026prophetic. An ambulance was parked immediately outside the entrance to the gym and there was a frantic coming and going of medical staff.\n\nI parked up slowly, in no rush to see what I knew had happened.\n\nOnce inside I weaved my way through the tables in the cafe to the large window that looked out over the poolside. The place where mothers gathered to watch their darlings paddling. I gawped with the other onlookers. Dozens of them. Sure enough a team of paramedics were gathered around the sauna. I felt myself nearly cracking up at how hot they must have been beneath their PPE. A gurney was slowly being wheeled into view. A decency sheet hiding the horrors beneath but there was no mistaking the shape of a body.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I murmured, not meaning to say it out loud or ask any one in particular but the lady next to me answered all the same.\n\n\u201cBody in the Sauna\u201d the stranger said curtly, like this happened all the time.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike they\u2019d been sat in there all night. No locks on those doors though. Apparently, they just sat there until they\u2026perspired.\u201d\n\nI looked back to the medical drama unfolding by the pool side and the body on the gurney. As it sat there you could see that something was beginning to seep through the thick white linen. The material clinging, sticking tighter to the corpse it was hiding, gluing itself to something\u2026sticky.\n\nThe sauna door was closed and a thin membrane of condensation coated the inside and just for a moment, amid all the movement, I could have sworn I spotted to hand prints on the glass, like\u2026claw marks.\n\n\u201cMike?\u201d A voice I knew cut through the crowd and I turned around to see two smiling faces at a nearby table. Lydia and Jen were sat having coffees like it was a normal morning and the corpse of one of their dear friends wasn\u2019t being paraded poolside. Lydia eagerly patted a free seat next to her. There was nothing for it but to join them. Somehow these strangers had become \u2018my people\u2019 after nothing more than a chance encounter.\n\nJen\u2019s hands had a slight shake to them as she raised the coffee to her mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again Mike.\u201d\n\n\u201cJen\u2026what is going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not entirely certain dear. Take a seat. Let me get you a drink. Coffee?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want\u2026not to be rude but\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot to take in.\u201d\n\n\u201cSak\u2019s fucking dead!\u201d I gasped. Unable to contain it any longer. I expected a conciliatory arm on my shoulder or a collective moment of grief but instead the two of them stared at me, bug eyed with horror.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jen gasped. The tendrils of steam from her coffee rising towards her nose. Reminding me of\u2026\n\n\u201cSak\u201d Lydia echoed.\n\n\u201cYes\u2026didn\u2019t you\u2026\u201d How could they not know\u2026\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who it is dear. The ambulance was here before us. Could be anyone for all we know\u2026\u201d Jen and Lydia shared a conspiratorial glance \u201cbut we\u2019d assumed\u2026\u201d Jen made a sudden sharp inhale, \u201cwe\u2019d assumed it was Andy.\u201d It almost sounded like\u2026relief.\n\nLydia smiled and showed me her phone. A whatsapp screen was open showing me a message thread for the Sauna Club. The last message was from \u2018Andy\u2019 with three black up arrow emoji\u2019s following his name. \u201cWe all on for this morning?\u201d he had asked with a sweaty face emoji and a cheeky wink.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u201d I mumbled. My mind racing to keep up with the events unfolding at the gym. I realised how little I knew about these people or the inner workings of their group.\n\n\u201cSo we knew that Andy was going\u2026but what makes you think it\u2019s Sak out there?\u201d Lydia asked, a sudden intensity in her beautiful face.\n\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026I just\u2026I thought\u2026\u201d I thought better of bringing up my dream.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Mike\u2026it\u2019s a lot to take in. Let me get you a coffee\u201d Jen pressed again and this time she stood, more determined to keep me with them by buying me a drink. \u201cLydia darling, anything for you?\u201d Lydia shook her head and Jen tottered away from her us towards the caf\u00e9, propping herself up on every chair or table she passed. She looked more frail than the last time I\u2019d seen her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you Mike\u201d Lydia smiled at me and my mind flashed up images of her naked body, disappearing into that strange wooden maze. \u201cWe\u2026didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d be coming back.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe neither.\u201d She shuffled closer to me on her chair and took hold of my hand \u201cListen. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got a lot of questions. I know I have\u2026but before Jen gets back I was wondering if you could do me a small favour?\u201d Her thumb gently stroked the palm of my hand and I knew that there was no way this could be a good thing.\u201cYou really think that\u2019s Sak out there?\u201d the burning intensity was back in her eyes and all I could do was nod slowly. \u201cBummer\u201d she sighed\u2026the understatement of the year. \u201cIf it is Sak he\u2019s got a black padlock with silver tribal designs on it\u2026like his stup- \u2026like his tattoo\u2019s\u2026the code is 3290\u201d The information came out quickly and easily and when she was finished she stared at me blankly, waiting to see what I\u2019d do with it. All I could do was blink. How did she know that?\n\n\u201cIf it is Sak then I think we owe it to him to gather his belongings\u2026there might be\u2026it\u2019s the right thing to do don\u2019t you agree?\u201d Lydia glanced towards the caf\u00e9 and then back to me. Her eyes grew soft and child like and a slow smiled danced across her lips \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d she repeated.\n\nHow could I refuse. I removed my hand from hers, not without noticing the line of scars that spiralled around her wrist and away up the sleeves of her shirt. She needed some one. Someone like me. I stood with a determined nod. Lydia beamed and as I stood she gave my love handles a quick pat. \u201cYou look good by the way Mike\u2026have you lost weight?\u201d I turned away before she could see me blush and made my way to the changing rooms.\n\nI regretted the decision as soon as I entered the locker rooms. The room was filled almost exclusively with medical staff and police. A stern faced chap clocked me as I entered \u201cnice and quickly mate we\u2019ve got to err\u2026we\u2019ll be wheeling them through in a minute and we\u2019ll need a clear path. Not something you\u2019ll want to see okay.\u201d\n\nI gave the officer a thumbs up and made it look like I was quickly heading towards my locker, all the while my scanning up and down the rows, searching for Saks padlock.My phone pinged in my pocket and I looked down to see that Lydia had added me to \u201cThe Sauna Club\u201d Whatsapp group. I should have taken a moment longer to ponder what game she was playing but I didn\u2019t want to pause in here any longer than I had to. I could feel the eyes of the police officer on my back.\n\nI spotted the padlock and made a beeline. 3\u20262\u20269\u20260 the numbers clicked in easily. The lock fell away and the door swung open. Inside was a gym bag with tacky flame decals along it, one of those litre sized drinking bottles with motivational sayings all down the side and a small notebook being crushed at the bottom. I was about to gather the lot when I paused. The next locker also had a padlock on it. I don't know why but the two of them side by side felt\u2026linked. Trying to be as discreet as possible I opened the whatsapp group again, clicked on to \u2018members\u2019 and dialled Andy\u2019s number.  \nI listened.  \nSure enough, from behind the small wooden door I heard the soft buzz of a phone vibrating.  \nSak hadn\u2019t gone alone into that strange world. Andy had taken him there. They had gone together and now Sak was dead and Andy was\u2026Well\u2026where was Andy?\n\n\u201cCome on mate\u201d the police offer said again \u201cYou don\u2019t wanna see this.\u201d His voice sounded different. I turned around and saw the officer had taken a seat on one of the changing benches. His face looked pale.  \n\u201cI\u2019ve spent years on the force\u2026thought I\u2019d\u2026thought I\u2019d just about seen it all\u2026but every now and again something comes along and\u2026\u201d   \nbehind the officer I could see the doorway leading to the showers.  \n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they do anything? Not a single thing to save his own life.\u201d  \nI thought we\u2019d been alone in the changing rooms but now I saw that every single one of the shower cubicles was full.  \n\u201cSat there for hours until\u2026his skin started to peel\u201d  \nAll the showers were on full blast, filling each cubicle with steam and through the condensation on the glass doors I could see a row of people.  \n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a body look so\u2026starved\u201d  \nHordes of dark figures, filling the showers and facing towards us.  \n\u201cAnd his eyes were so\u2026dry\u2026so dry\u201d  \nMore and more figures gathering in the swirling white clouds, Waiting to spill out into the changing room and-  \n\u201cI better get going\u201d I stammered, and without another word I grabbed Sak\u2019s belongings and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I returned to the caf\u00e9 my phone buzzed again at the same time the tanoy sounded. \u201cThe sauna is currently closed and will be until further notice\u201d said the voice. The push notification on my phone was identical.  \nAs I returned to the caf\u00e9 I noticed that Jen had her head pressed against the table, audibly crying. Lydia was trying her best to console her. I sat quietly beside her and deposited Sak\u2019s bag by her feet. Lydia gave me a smile and a wink.  \n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d I mouthed.Lydia nodded towards the Jens phone on the table, where the push notification was still illuminated. Beside the phone was a lock of grey hair, recently fallen from Jens head.\n\n\u201cI need it though\u2026I need it, I need it, I need it.\u201d Jens sobs racked her body.\n\n\u201cShh, it\u2019s okay Jen\u2026We\u2019ll work it out\u201d Lydia cooed.\n\nJens head flicked up, angry now \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are after Lydia, but without the sauna I\u2019m dead okay. Dead. I\u2019ve already been here longer than I should have and if I can\u2019t go back I might as well-\u201d \n\nAll at once the fight went out of her. Jen saw I was back, wiped the tears from her eyes and smiled. I was shocked at how quickly she could put that mask back on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Mike\u2026\u201d She said calmly now \u201cI know this is all new to you. But\u2026that place\u2026on the other side of the steam\u2026it\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s everything to me\u201d\n\n\u201cUs.\u201d Lydia corrected.\n\n\u201cUs\u2026I told you we all went there looking for something\u2026for me it was a cure. And the sauna has given me more time than I thought possible. And last time I went\u2026I thought I\u2019d found\u2026something more permanent. If I could have just gone one more time I think-\u201d\n\n\u201cListen\u201d Lydia cut her off \u201cI have an\u2026idea.\u201d She took hold of both our hands. \u201cSak was a PT right? And Mike here has just been so kind as to retrieve his bag from the changing rooms.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d hissed Jen, taken aback. She turned to stare at me with a face that screamed 'what have you done'...It was then and only then that I realised that the little favour that Lydia had just asked of me was almost certainly illegal. \n\nLydia went on \u201c I know for a fact that Sak had his own key pass to get into the gym outside of hours for teaching.\u201d\n\n\u201cLydia no...\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s stopping us from coming back later tonight and\u2026exploring.\u201d\n\nSilence. \n\nThe three of us slowly exchanged looks. The law was the obvious answer but something else hung in the air\u2026that supernatural \u2018what if?\u2019\n\n\u201cI think\u2026\u201d I spoke slowly, unsure of where this thought might lead, but they had to know \u201cI think that Andy was there this morning\u2026I think that he\u2019s still in there.\u201d\n\nAnother heavy silence as we weighed up the costs of this decision. A heavy silence as we remembered Andy's warning. \"Never stay longer than the sandtimer.\"   \nI\u2019d be lying if I said that the pull of that strange world had taken hold of me\u2026both it\u2019s promise and it\u2019s danger. To save Andy, to find out what happened to Sak and to find something for me\u2026to change my own life in all the ways it so desperately needed changing. For Jen, a new life, a cure. And for Lydia\u2026What was in this for her? She seemed to want it more than any of us.\n\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d said Jen eventually.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d Lydia said, her eyes growing wide with excitement. \u201cMike?\u201d\n\nAll eyes on me. \n\n\u201cLets do it.\u201dAnd that was that. The deal was done, the decision made.\n\nI\u2019m home now\u2026counting down the hours until midnight, until Sauna Club\u2026maybe the last time we ever do Sauna Club. One last time to find the secrets that rest in that terrifying world. One last time to save Andy\u2026one last chance to change my life too.\n\nI was just doing the dishes to take my mind off things and in the dusk I caught sight of my old half built garden sauna again.\n\nI was thinking...how hard would it be to finish that off...and have a gateway to that strange world whenever I needed it? \n\nAnd just as that thought occurred I could have sworn I saw something move inside that dilapidated shed. Something dark but human shaped...and with eyes learning burning coals...and a knowing smile. Just like...\n\nAndy?\n\nMy phone rang, and by the time I looked up again the shed was empty.\n\nIt was just my wife leaving a voicemail to say she\u2019s staying out again this evening. \u201cSave on the commute\u201d. As if I don\u2019t fucking know what she\u2019s up to.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t matter. If the sauna can save Jen\u2019s life then in can change mine.\n\nThat makes this stupid decision even easier\u2026no need for lies. I\u2019ll just steal away in the dead of night and maybe she\u2019ll never see me again.That doesn\u2019t change the facts though does it\u2026this is a bad idea\u2026isn\u2019t it?",

I can't do cold either.\n\nWhat all of that means is that I am constitutionally incapable of finding out what this is all about unless you do it and tell me about it!

    "postText": "The crunch made by snapping a thick tree branch is not entirely dissimilar to the crunch made by a human being\u2019s neck when it\u2019s broken.\n\nFun little factoid for you.\n\nAs I\u2019m writing this, I\u2019m huddled in my car on the side of the road in one of Oregon\u2019s many huge forests. When we entered the woods, there were eight of us. Now, as far as I know, just me.\n\nLet\u2019s explain things, no? Considering that when the cops get here, I\u2019m almost definitely going to prison.\n\nYesterday morning, me and seven of my friends piled into our cars and set out for a weekend camping trip. We arrived around noon to our campsite and began getting things set up for our stay.\n\nThe trek from the road to the site was not\u2026 pleasant. Jeremy, the outdoorsy guy in the group, decided that camping in an established site was too \u201cbeta\u201d for him, and therefore us, so we needed to rough it somewhere off the grid. His brother Greg and girlfriend Loretta thought this was a great idea.\n\nThe rest of us were not as enthusiastic. My partner, Ivy, was very vocal about their complaints, something I tried to stay out of when Jeremy fired back. Like watching two cowboys dueling, but instead of six shooters it was emasculating comments and ignorant remarks.\n\n\u201cY\u2019know Jeremy, a real man knows when to listen to his friends. Just saying.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, well what would you know about-\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright! Enough of that conversation, let\u2019s keep moving, yeah?\u201d\n\nAdam popped in between the pair, hands up. A grin rested on his face, but the stress was clear in his eyes. His brothers, Luke and Peter, stood back, watching their older brother handle the situation with all the grace of a blind hippo.\n\nJeremy rolled his eyes. \u201cYeah, well, tell this bitch to stay in her lane.\u201d\n\nMy voice joined six others in a chorus of \u201cTheir,\u201d leading to another eye-roll from Jeremy, before he set off further into the woods.\n\nAdam fell in step with Ivy and I, muttering under his breath about Jeremy, calling him all sorts of lovely names. The three of us grinned at each other before Adam fell off further back to walk with his brothers.\n\nThe woods were silent as we walked. That should\u2019ve been our first red flag, looking back on things. It\u2019s never fully silent in the forest. \n\nAnd yet, we thought nothing of it, moving on as if things were just as they should be.\n\nWe eventually made it to the site. A small circle, looking over a beautiful lake. The campsite was about 15 feet away from a huge cliff, easily a 250 foot fall into the icy water.\n\nJeremy looked over our grins and nods, smirking at us all. \u201cSee? What sort of campsite has a view like this?\u201d\n\nWe all mumbled in frustrated agreement, which only led to him laughing. \u201cListen, when it comes to this sort of thing, I\u2019m your guy. If you need\u2026 bible verses, go to the freaks,\u201d Jeremy scowled at Adam and his brothers. \u201cOr, maybe, if you need some freaky goth lullabye, go to Marcy.\u201d \n\nJeremy nodded at me, and I shook my head. No way was I gonna become a pawn in all his shit.\n\nHe shrugged and kept going on his weird little alpha male tangent, but I tuned him out as Ivy and I got our tent set up.\n\nAfter a few hours, everyone was situated. We celebrated getting here in one piece with a lot of booze, as any good 20-something would do. The conflicts of the day were quickly forgotten once the tequila got broken out, and we were dancing to shitty music played from a bluetooth speaker while our campfire roared in the background. It was a good time.\n\nUntil the conservation officer showed up.\n\nWe heard the engine cutting through the trees long before we saw anyone, but we were so drunk we didn\u2019t really seem to notice it getting closer until we saw the headlights peering through the undergrowth. The engine cut out, and we heard a soft grunt as a man dismounted from what we could now see was an ATV.\n\nPushing branches aside, I saw this mountain of a man peering down at us. Easily pushing seven feet tall, with rough, leathery skin and a bushy brown beard. He wore sunglasses that concealed his eyes, and the typical light brown uniform you\u2019d see on a park ranger, complete with the wide brimmed hat. When he spoke, his voice was deep and resonant, yet soft at the same time.\n\n\u201cI think you all might have broken a few rules here in this here campsite, friends.\u201d\n\nHeads turned to look at the stranger, who grinned through his beard. \u201cYes, I do think-\u201d\n\nJeremy piped up, walking over to the man with all the bravado of a drunk. \u201cListen, dude, we\u2019re not hurting nobody, just having some fun.\u201d\n\nThe officer looked down at Jeremy, shaking his head. \u201cNo, son, you\u2019re hurting plenty. The animals of this here forest, by blasting your loud ass music all over. The forest itself, leaving garbage all over. Your fellow campers. And myself. I don\u2019t take too kindly to folks behaving the way you\u2019re behaving.\u201d\n\nJeremy swayed a little on his feet, before pointing at the man. \u201cWell, I think maybe YOU-\u201d\n\nThe officer moved deceptively quick for a man of his size, grabbing Jeremy by the shoulder and tossing him aside, his head slamming into a tree trunk with a loud *crack.* The officer held up a finger in a \u201cone moment\u201d motion, before walking over to Jeremy, who was holding his head, his hand coming away sticky with blood.\n\nThe officer looked up at the trees, grabbing a thick tree limb with one hand and snapping it off the body of the tree, a loud *crunch* coming from the tree as he did. He looked down at Jeremy, who looked back up at him and finally seemed to realize what was happening, holding his hands up in defense.\n\n\u201cHey, man, hey. Let\u2019s just chill out and-\u201d\n\nThe officer brought the limb down with such force on Jeremy\u2019s outstretched hand that a bone jutted out from near his elbow, and he screamed, dropping his arms down to his chest. A choir of screams erupted from the campsite as the limb was brought down on his head once, before it was tossed aside.\n\nThe officer grabbed Jeremy by the shoulders and stood him up, blood running down between his eyes. He was alive, barely, but clearly in a bad state.\n\nThe officer wrapped an arm around his shoulders, looking at all of us. \u201cYou all are being damn near horrible to this here forest. And so, I\u2019m gonna be damn near horrible to all you. Starting with this one here.\u201d\n\nWith that, he slipped his arm around Jeremy\u2019s neck and yanked hard to one side. A sickening *crunch* not dissimilar to the tree limb breaking could be heard, and Jeremy collapsed to the forest floor, the light of life rapidly leaving his eyes.\n\nMost of us were too stunned to really react, save for Peter, one of Adam\u2019s younger brothers. He let out a scream and rushed the officer, who reacted with a firm punch between Peter\u2019s eyes, dropping the teen immediately. \u201cNow, that\u2019s no way to react\u2026\u201d\n\nThe officer walked past me, dragging Peter\u2019s body behind him. He smelled of aftershave and sweat, and I realized this was my chance to get the fuck out of here. I grabbed Ivy\u2019s arm and started slowly making my way back towards the woods.\n\nThe officer hoisted Peter up by his shirt collar, shaking his head as he stopped near the cliff drop. \u201cWell! Down ya go, youngin\u2019.\u201d\n\nAs he threw Peter over the cliff, Adam rushed him as well, a tent peg in his hand. He let out a cry as he slammed the peg into the officer\u2019s back, and he let out a grunt as he whirled around with a backhand that Adam was able to duck under, before running into the woods. \n\nThe officer glared at us all as he watched us scatter into the woods, the evening sun framing him as he stood on the cliffside.\n\nAs we ran, Ivy stopped near his ATV, slamming their nail file into one of the tires. The blade snapped as they pulled it back out, but the hissing of air leaking revealed their strike was effective. We scattered into the trees, knowing this man was likely hot on our trails.\n\n---\n\nAlright, that\u2019s about all I have in me to relive at the moment, emotionally. I\u2019m going to try and get some sleep, hope a car comes by and picks me up soon. I\u2019ll go more into depth about what happened next another time.",

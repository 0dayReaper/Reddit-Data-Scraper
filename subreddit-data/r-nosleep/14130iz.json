    "postText": "Something happened tonight. Something always seems to be happening these days, but this time, it was particularly confusing.\n\nSome days don't even feel real anymore. \n\nAfter my last post, I did as my savior human had advised me. I called Mary Markov and relayed to her what Jewel had told me. She promised to send agents to the warehouse right away, and late that same night, she reached out to me once again with news of an arrest having been made. Despite this small success, we both knew that this meant outright war. The Collective would know who had given them away, and the possibility of me joining their ranks peacefully would be off the table. The question remaining was when they would make good on their threat. Nettie Peterson's house is being guarded by covert Agency personnel, and mine and Eli's apartments are under watch, too. I'm glad Mary Markov is doing what she can to protect them, but I never doubted that complications would arise eventually. \n\nJust not quite so soon. \n\nThe day started off fine. My best friend, still being relatively used to having agents around, doesn't seem to mind the aforementioned changes. The van inconspicuously parked outside her house didn't bother her in the least as she went about her morning routine. I helped her throw together something nourishing for breakfast, then watched her doing her makeup. She likes to keep her lips glossy and often applies lime green eyeshadow paired with a pear-colored line and, on special days, the occasional rhinestone. She looks like a garden fairy. When I told her that today, she treated me to a bright smile and a pat on the cheek. \n\nShe went off to look after her larvae, leaving me to roam her house alone. I spent some time inspecting the many drawings she keeps framed on the high wall in the living room. She always brings new ones home from work\u2014gifts from the kindergarteners. They're not very artistically skilled, but they do produce interesting work. Nettie hangs them all up on the special wall, even the really bad ones. I watched TV for a couple hours, then read until Nettie came home. \n\nIt was getting dark out when she realized she needed tampons. She said she could get by on what she had until the morning, but no longer. I told her to stay put and that I'd run and get some for her, which is why I went on that fateful evening walk. I gave a quick nod to the agent leaning against the van outside as I started heading down the street, backpack slung over my shoulder. I made it to the convenience store five minutes before closing time, giving the annoyed cashier an apologetic look as she rang me up. Outside, the nightly blackness had settled over the rooftops, and I took in a deep breath, letting the fresh air flood my body.\n\nAll was well as I began to march back in the direction of Nettie's home. Until I heard a motorcycle revving.\n\n\u2026Jewel?\n\nI instantly froze up. There was no one immediately in sight. I tried to soothe my fevered mind. There was no reason to be so on edge. A lot of town residents owned motorcycles, or at least I assumed they did. This reaction was a testament to my own waning sanity, no doubt. I shuddered, making an effort to shake the thought. There was a nervous tension in my step as I continued on my way. The engine noises faded off into the distance after a while, and I concluded that I was indeed becoming a bit paranoid. \n\nStep by step, I carried myself towards my goal. Nettie Peterson's street wasn't anywhere in sight yet, but I would probably be at her door in around ten minutes tops. I had walked the distance between her house and the store often enough to estimate. I considered putting my earbuds in and listening to some music as a distraction, but I was afraid of what I might end up missing if I took away my sense of hearing. I began to chew on the inside of my cheek.\n\nThere was not a soul out except for me. This wasn't uncommon considering the size of our town, but given the circumstances, it still served to elevate my heart rate. I repeatedly tried and failed to calm myself. Eventually, I couldn't help it anymore. I took off running. And then it happened\u2014someone stepped out from a sidestreet right ahead of me and we collided. Large hands flew to my shoulders, long fingers harshly digging into them. I didn't need to look up at the other person to recognize them. I sensed the same musky smell that had lingered around my room for hours after their last visit; warm, sweet and impossible to ignore. I could suddenly hear every single beat of my heart reverberating between my ears. Dread seemed to dribble down my bone-dry throat, pooling in my stomach like cold water. \n\nI slowly lifted my head, knowing exactly who was about to stare back at me. \n\nJewel's eyes were incredibly wide. Their brows were trembling in manic, barely restrained fury, their lower lip quivered and, to my complete bewilderment, tears were freely rolling down their cheeks. They solidified the moment the skin contact was lost, turning into shimmering stones of green, blue and violet. I reached out and caught one before it could hit the ground. It was bright pink, and I found myself captivated by its beauty.\n\n\"So, can I\u2026 keep this?\" I asked, tilting my head at the cultist. \n\nTheir chest was rising and falling heavily, and I shrank back a little when I took note of their nostrils flaring. \"You are *so* dead,\" they uttered in a low, husky growl.\n\n\"I take it you got news of the Agency's involvement?\"\n\nJewel once more closed the distance between us. They leaned down, their gemstone tears bouncing off my chest as they fell. \"You spiteful little bitch. You'd rather try to ruin a good cause than forgive me and work together?\" \n\n\"You can't be this delusional.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me what I can and cannot do!\" they snapped, their voice rising to an eerily high pitch. They paused, looking briefly confused by what they'd said before the wrathful expression twisted their features again.\n\n\"What now? Are you seriously going to attack me out in the open like this?\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Jewel drew themself up, squaring their muscled shoulders. \"Oh, I'll manage.\"\n\nTheir outline before me started to blur, becoming fuzzy and indistinct. I blinked, then reached up to rub my eyes. They weren't becoming any clearer, though. Frowning, I took several steps back, squinting at the spot where the cultist had just been standing. The cultist was quickly turning into a faint, paling swirl of colors, losing shape before at last disappearing completely. \n\nI was speechless, my pulse racing as beads of sweat ran down the side of my face. I couldn't believe it. Had all of this been some sort of hallucination? I raised a hand to my feverishly hot forehead. I was losing my mind. That had to be it. My gaze dropped to the gray asphalt and my breath caught in my throat when I spotted the colorful stones lying at my feet. *Fuck.*\n\nA soft laugh rang out beside my ear, a draft of moist, warm air grazing my cheek. \n\nI instinctively swung at the emptiness beside me, my clenched fist connecting with nothing. *No.* \n\n\"Come back here,\" I whined, flinching at the unmasked fear in my own voice. A sharp pain flared up in my ankle as my feet were swiped out from under me. I let out a squeak as I fell onto my open palms, managing to shield my head from the impact just in time. The rough ground scraped my hands and knees as I hurriedly pushed myself up, a few stray pebbles drawing blood. Despite my panic, my mind was clear enough to understand that I was in a precarious position. I couldn't just whip out my tentacles\u2014not here where anyone could see me. It would for sure result in hysteria. People could start straight-up shooting at me. I'd end up looking like a monstrosity on a rampage, especially with Jewel having gone invisible. As it were, I only had one option, and that was to run. \n\nI didn't waste another second. There was no way I was leading this murder cultist back to Nettie, but I had to find somewhere with other people, *anywhere\u2026*\n\nAimlessly charging ahead, I tried to bring more distance between myself and the disembodied footsteps ringing out from behind me. Before long however, it was becoming hard to tell how far away they truly were. The sound seemed to flit from side to side, reaching my ears from constantly changing directions. *The asshole was messing with my head.* \n\nSoon enough, my lungs were on fire. My sides were stinging; breathing became harder. I inwardly cursed my useless short legs. Still, I didn't slow down; I didn't dare to. I was growing increasingly desperate. Where was I supposed to go? I couldn't think of any places still open. And then, cutting through the darkness, a flickering neon sign offered the answer to all of my questions. Tom's Diner. With hope renewing my spirits, I picked up my pace once more. Rhonda was just in the process of moving the big menu sign inside for the night. I came to a skittering halt mere inches in front of her, helplessly grabbing onto her apron before she could close the door behind her. \n\nShe spun around to face me with knotted brows. \"Evangeline?\"\n\n\"Help me,\" I wheezed. \"Let me in, quick!\"\n\nRhonda, though still visibly perplexed, sprang into action, dragging me inside along with her. I slammed the door shut, throwing my entire weight against it. An unseen force clashed against it from outside, making the entire storefront shudder. The waitress nearly dropped her sign. \"What in the\u2014\"\n\n\"They're after me,\" I choked out. \"You can't see them, but they're right outside!\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Her expression cleared up. \"Say no more, say no more.\" She reached into her apron pocket, rummaging around while mumbling to herself. \"I'm picking up what you're putting down\u2026\" She produced a bright red marker. \"Allow me.\" Swiftly stepping up to me, she raised the felt tip to my forehead, proceeding to draw something onto my skin with smooth, efficient accuracy. An incoherent whisper slipped from her lips, words in a language I had never heard before. Finally, she pulled back. \"Turn around, try if you can see them now. The door locks automatically, by the way.\"\n\nI hesitantly shifted my weight back onto my feet, releasing the door and turning to look out into the night. I let out a gasp, staggering back when I found the contorted visage of the cultist pressed up against the glass. Jewel's eyes were still rimmed with shimmering tears, their mouth twisted in a grimace of murderous rage. They frowned in confusion when they realized that my gaze was once more trained on them. It didn't take long until they started pounding on the windowpane again. \n\n\"Hey! You stop that,\" Rhonda shouted, stabbing a finger in their direction. \"I just cleaned that today! Oh hell\u2026 Hailey!\" she called over her shoulder. \"We have a problem; come help.\"\n\nAnother waitress came rushing out of the back room. Glancing between us and the pacing cultist outside had her huff out a sigh. \"I see,\" she said icily. Determinedly striding towards the door, she lifted her voice, beginning to recite a verse or rhyme of some sort. It all sounded like gibberish to me. My head was spinning, my mind running wild, unable to keep track of what was happening around me. My skull suddenly felt prickly from the inside, my whole body seemingly turning weightless. My vision fell away as my eyes rolled back and my knees gave out from beneath me. I had lost consciousness before I hit the floor.\n\nI don't believe I was out for very long, despite my exhausted body embracing the cold slumber. A voice tugged on the edge of my hearing, gently guiding me towards wakefulness. I had been moved onto a slightly softer, more comfortable surface. I arduously craned my neck up to overlook my surroundings. I was lying on one of the padded benches next to the stationary tables. Crouching beneath it in order to sit close to me was a very familiar figure.\n\n\"Hey, Sunshine.\" Frankie Preston straightened up as far as he could without hitting his head. \"Sorry I wasn't there to catch you when you fainted. Too bad. It could have been our movie-moment.\"\n\nI smiled at him. Then I jolted upright, nearly kicking Frankie under the table as I planted my feet on the floor to train my eyes on Rhonda. She was leaning against the partition wall of the booth, typing away on her phone. \"You,\" I uttered. \"You and that other lady did some kind of\u2026 witchcraft-thing.\" \n\nShe glanced up briefly. \"Oh. That was nothing, really. Forget about it.\"\n\nFran poked his head out from between my legs. \"What's this about witchcraft?\"\n\nRhonda shrugged. \"Hailey and I just performed some basic spells to get rid of your little wife's stalker.\"\n\n\"Could you *please* not\u2014nevermind that; what are you even talking about?\" Fran's voice was dripping with bewilderment.\n\nThe older woman raised a brow at him. \"Honey, we're\u2026 we're witches. You *did* know that, right?\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Right?\" Rhonda repeated, once again not receiving a response.\n\n\"I don't think he did,\" I supplied helpfully. \n\n\"You're kidding me.\" Rhonda stared at the blonde with her mouth agape. \"How could you not have known? You lived with us for almost two years!\"\n\nHe still gave no answer. \n\n\"Honey, you *saw everything!* You saw my herbs\u2026\" Her voice faltered in disbelief. \"And the ceremonial daggers\u2026 The charms around the doors!\"\n\nHe shrugged.\n\n\"You played with Mae-Lynn's casting crystals for a whole afternoon? You were *in the room* when Paloma made her sacrifice for Loki's favor? You literally watched all six of us at our bonfire dance during the blood moon!\"\n\n\"I thought that was just another crunchy mom thing.\"\n\n\"Crunchy mom thing?\" she echoed, her chest rising at the affront. Jabbing a finger at my forehead, she added, \"And how would you have accounted for that?\"\n\n\"That little drawing? I thought Eva had gotten herself tattooed.\" Frankie glanced between Rhonda and me in confusion. \n\n\"It's a magic symbol, for crying out loud; it's a protection against forces messing with her perception!\" the waitress explained in audible exasperation. \"And who would get their forehead inked?\"\n\n\"Eva might. You gotta admit she has peculiar fashion tastes,\" Frankie argued.\n\nI couldn't help but chime in. \"Why do people keep saying that?\"\n\nRhonda threw her hands up in defeat.\n\nI cleared my throat. \"You're saying that all the ladies working here have supernatural abilities?\"\n\n\"Like I just told you.\" She rubbed her temples with both hands. \"And I'm sorry you fainted. It had to do with Hailey\u2014her magic is great for defending against dark influences. The spell she cast was to scare off your attacker, but it seems to have affected you, too.\"\n\n\"I don't consider myself a dark influence.\"\n\n\"Well, you *are* an interdimensional being,\" Rhonda replied. \"Not normally mankind's best friend. But I know you're a good kid. Don't worry.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much for helping me,\" I said softly, staring at my hands as I folded them in my lap. \"I apologize for the inconvenience.\"\n\n\"It's cool.\"\n\n\"So, the six of you all together are probably really powerful?\" I inquired, an idea faintly taking shape in my mind. \n\n\"You could say that,\" Rhonda answered, not without a hint of pride.\n\n\"Is there any way I could get your input on a problem I've been having?\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" she said slowly. \"We'll hear you out, sure, but that's about all the promises I'll make for now, okay?\"\n\n\"Yes, perfect.\"\n\n\"Alright. I'll talk to the girls and we'll be in touch.\" She zipped up her jacket, shoving her phone into her pocket. \"Goodnight, you two.\"\n\nWith that, she left us sitting in the empty diner. Frankie still looked rather puzzled. Shaking his head, he turned to give me a droll smile. \"How embarrassing. I normally pride myself on being perceptive. People are strange though, aren't they?\" He sat down beside me on the bench, shuffling closer. \"You ran into trouble again? With the cultist?\" \n\nI didn't really want to relay the entirety of what I'd learned from Jewel to him\u2014somehow, I didn't think Frankie would be opposed to someone bringing by the end of the world. It would be best to keep that particular piece of information stored away for a while longer. Instead, I asked a completely different, if not wholly unrelated question. \"The other day, you told me about feeling destructive and grimy. Where is that coming from?\"\n\n\"Sunshine, I know I've danced around this for long enough. I can tell you, but you look miserable right now. I'd much rather have you in better spirits first.\" He placed a tentative hand on my back. \"Anything I can do to cheer you up?\"\n\nI started chewing on my lower lip, not meeting his gaze.\n\n\"You're thinking about kissing me again, aren't you?\" Frankie asked, having apparently learned how to read minds.\n\n\"We don't have to. I do *not* care.\"\n\n\"That nearly crossed the line between accommodating and insulting. Look, I *want to*. You just caught me off guard the last time.\" He pulled a wet string from his chewing gum. I waited in silence for him to continue. \"I'm honestly surprised you're still up to it. I know I'm a piece of shit.\"\n\n\"You're not\u2014\"\n\n\"I am. And what's more, you should know that kissing is as far as things are gonna get between us. I don't do the sex-thing. That's nothing to do with how much I like you or anything. I just don't do that.\" He had removed his gum from his mouth completely, instead fumbling around with it like play doh. \"If that cancels out the whole liking-me-extravaganza, then it's best we cleared that up beforehand.\" He turned to face me. \"What's that look for?\"\n\nI was beaming at him with more conviction that I had found the most perfect being than ever. \"This works out beautifully,\" I told him.\n\n\"Are you sure? You're not just saying this?\"\n\n\"If you don't take my word for it, I wouldn't know how else to prove it.\"\n\n\"I believe you! I'm glad, I really am, I'm just kinda stunned.\" He straightened up. \"I want to kiss you even more now.\"\n\nA quiet squeak came from somewhere in my throat. \"I can hear my pulse,\" I remarked.\n\n\"Yeah, me too.\" He grinned, propping his chin in his palm. \"Excited?\"\n\n\"You know that.\" Feeling I had to share more, I added, \"This is the first time for me. That doesn't change anything, does it?\"\n\nFran's brows rose a great deal. \"Huh.\"\n\n\"Is that bad?\"\n\n\"No! But seriously, is *this* gonna be your first kiss?\" He gestured at our surroundings. \"A dingy little diner after hours? Not very romantic, is it?\"\n\n\"That's fine,\" I assured him.\n\n\"Nope. We can do better.\" He got off the bench, drawing himself up to his full height (which wasn't very impressive either). \"It doesn't have to be a big deal, but it should be *nice*. You're getting a good first kiss. I'll think of something. Don't worry, I won't go over the top.\"\n\nI couldn't help but smile at that. Letting him pull me to my feet, I briefly went in for a hug. I nearly jumped when he turned his head and pressed his lips to my cheek. \"That doesn't count.\" He held onto my hand as he let go. \"So\u2026 how would you feel about hypothetically burning a building together?\"\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13dr5g0/help_im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[2:

    "postText": "I wasn't sure where else to post these stories, so I figured I'd share them here. I've been an SAR officer for a few years now, and along the way I've seen some things that I think you guys will be interested in. \n\n* I have a pretty good track record for finding missing people. Most of the time they just wander off the path, or slip down a small cliff, and they can't find their way back. The majority of them have heard the old 'stay where you are' thing, and they don't wander far. But I've had two cases where that didn't happen. Both bother me a lot, and I use them as motivation to search even harder on the missing persons cases I get called on. \nThe first was a little boy who was out berry-picking with his parents. He and his sister were together, and both of them went missing around the same time. Their parents lost sight of them for a few seconds, and in that time both the kids apparently wandered off. When their parents couldn't find them, they called us, and we came out to search the area. We found the daughter pretty quickly, and when we asked where her brother was, she told us that he'd been taken away by 'the bear man.' She said he gave her berries and told her to stay quiet, that he wanted to play with her brother for a while. The last she saw of her brother, he was riding on the shoulders of 'the bear man' and seemed calm. Of course, our first thought was abduction, but we never found a trace of another human being in that area. The little girl was also insistent that he wasn't a normal man, but that he was tall and covered in hair, 'like a bear', and that he had a 'weird face.' We searched that area for *weeks*, it was one of the longest calls I've ever been on, but we never found a single trace of that kid. \nThe other was a young woman who was out hiking with her mom and grandpa. According to the mother, her daughter had climbed up a tree to get a better view of the forest, and she'd never come back down. They waited at the base of the tree for hours, calling her name, before they called for help. Again, we searched everywhere, and we never found a trace of her. I have no idea where she could possibly have gone, because neither her mother or grandpa saw her come down.\n\n* A few times, I've been out on my own searching with a canine, and they've tried to lead me straight up cliffs. Not hills, not even rock faces. Straight, sheer cliffs with no possible handholds. It's always baffling, and in those cases we usually find the person on the other side of the cliff, or miles away from where the canine has led us. I'm sure there's an explanation, but it's sort of strange.\n\n* One particularly sad case involved the recovery of a body. A nine-year-old girl fell down an embankment and got impaled on a dead tree at the base. It was a complete freak accident, but I'll never forget the sound her mother made when we told her what had happened. She saw the body bag being loaded into the ambulance, and she let out the most haunting, heart-broken wail I've ever heard. It was like her whole life was crashing down around her, and a part of her had died with her daughter. I heard from another SAR officer that she killed herself a few weeks after it happened. She couldn't live with the loss of her daughter.\n\n* I was teamed up with another SAR officer because we'd received reports of bears in the area. We were looking for a guy who hadn't come home from a climbing trip when he was supposed to, and we ended up having to do some serious climbing to get to where we figured he'd be. We found him trapped in a small crevasse with a broken leg. It was not pleasant. He'd been there for almost two days, and his leg was very obviously infected. We were able to get him into a chopper, and I heard from one of the EMTs that the guy was absolutely inconsolable. He kept talking about how he'd been doing fine, and when he'd gotten to the top, a man had been there. He said the guy had no climbing equipment, and he was wearing a parka and ski pants. He walked up to the guy, and when the guy turned around, he said he had no face. It was just blank. He freaked out, and ended up trying to get off the mountain too fast, which is why he'd fallen. He said he could hear the guy all night, climbing down the mountain and letting out these horrible muffled screams. That story bothered the hell out of me. I'm glad I wasn't there to hear it. \n\n* One of the scariest things I've ever had happen to me involved the search for a young woman who'd gotten separated from her hiking group. We were out until late at night, because the dogs had picked up her scent. When we found her, she was curled up under a large rotted log. She was missing her shoes and pack, and she was clearly in shock. She didn't have any injuries, and we were able to get her to walk with us back to base ops. Along the way, she kept looking behind us and asking us why 'that big man with black eyes' was following us. We couldn't see anyone, so we just wrote it off as some weird symptom of shock. But the closer we got to base, the more agitated this woman got. She kept asking me to tell him to stop 'making faces' at her. At one point she stopped and turned around and started yelling into the forest, saying that she wanted him to leave her alone. She wasn't going to go with him, she said, and she wouldn't give us to him. We finally got her to keep moving, but we started hearing these weird noises coming from all around us. It was almost like coughing, but more rhythmic and deeper. It was almost insect-like, I don't really know how else to describe it. When we were within site of base ops, the woman turns to me, and her eyes are about as wide as I can imagine a human could open them. She touches my shoulder and says 'He says to tell you to speed up. He doesn't like looking at the scar on your neck.' I have a very small scar on the base of my neck, but it's mostly hidden under my collar, and I have no idea how this woman saw it. Right after she says it, I hear that weird coughing right in my ear, and I just about jumped out of my skin. I hustled her to ops, trying not to show how freaked out I was, but I have to say I was really happy when we left the area that night.\n\n* This is the last one I'll tell, and it's probably the weirdest story I have. Now, I don't know if this is true in every SAR unit, but in mine, it's sort of an unspoken, regular thing we run into. You can try asking about it with other SAR officers, but even if they know what you're talking about, they probably won't say anything about it. We've been told not to talk about it by our superiors, and at this point we've all gotten so used to it that it doesn't even seem weird anymore.\nOn just about every case where we're really far into the wilderness, I'm talking 30 or 40 miles, at some point we'll find a staircase in the middle of the woods. It's almost like if you took the stairs in your house, cut them out, and put them in the forest. I asked about it the first time I saw some, and the other officer just told me not to worry about it, that it was normal. Everyone I asked said the same thing. I wanted to go check them out, but I was told, very emphatically, that I should never go near any of them. I just sort of ignore them now when I run into them because it happens so frequently. \n\nI have a lot more stories, and I suppose if anyone's interested, I'll tell some of them tomorrow. If anyone has any theories about the stairs, or if you've seen them too, let me know. \n\n**EDIT: Part 2 is up: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3ijnt6/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest/**",

Up here in New England, in some of the more rural states, it's not at all impossible to find old foundations, cellars, or even short staircases just out in Bumfuck, Nowhere. That's if they're built well, but they're kinda rare and usually are accompanied by foundations. And that's not just a NoSleep story, that's real.\n\nIt's strange to think that there are places in this world, touched and then forgotten by Man. And we never know about them until we stumble upon the evidence and wonder why there's no story, why there's clearly signs of previous habitation that was just... left behind. Humans are REALLY good at finding value in even the most adverse locations, so why not here?\n\nWhat's so bad about this place that made people leave it and erase its existence from memory?",

These deep pools are at the base of each cliff (each cliff marks where the falls used to be as they receded over time through erosion) and are a favorite spot for cliffdivers despite how small of a target you have to hit.\n\nThe pools are spooky enough as is, but the really terrifying part is that the bottoms of the tubes are littered with the remains of divers that we're unlucky enough to have some kind of accident while enjoying the falls and drowned. I don't have any official data on how many bodies are at the bottoms of the tubes, but I've heard tell that a fair number of the corpses are from ancient (relatively-speaking) native Americans. The tubes are too deep and treacherous to safely recover bodies, apparently, without protective equipment.\n\nFor hundreds of years this place may have been collecting bodies, but damn if thows cliffs aren't fun to dive off of!\n\nI should say that a lot of this stuff is hearsay and I don't have any hard evidence, but if you can find the falls, it's a great spooky story to tell your friends. I just wish I could remember the name of the place :( And sorry for rambling, I do that when I'm exhausted",

I just moved to New Mexico from Virginia (with a couple week long stints in other places).  \nI was hiking around the La Luz trail on the Sandia Mountains.  I stumbled upon some staircases that lead to nowhere.  One of them in particular was very small, like fairies or elves used it!\nIt turns out these staircases were built by Eisenhower and the CCC (Civil Conservation Core).  Most of these staircases started at the end of a remote, long dirt road (that was scheduled by another government agency to eventually be paved).  The staircases lead to picnic areas and overnight areas for campers.  \nThe CCC were very \"unique\" -and took to unique construction of staircases, picnic tables, shelters.  -Example: The Juan Tabo Picnic grounds have a mini-staircase that used to lead up to tiny wooden picnic tables for kids.  Thieves stole those picnic tables.  The CCC was also, well, dumb?  They would build structures that were easily scrapped for parts, stolen in their entirety, or naturally destroyed over time by the elements.    The Albuquerque journal did an article about this construction (the USFS wants to restore some of these)...In the article they reference the CCC building a camp spot that included a wooden table that was chained to a boulder, and campers would sit on smaller boulders.  Well, the table is gone, so now it looks like two chains sticking out of a boulder like some 9 foot tall monster used to be strapped to that boulder.  Creepy, yes, but mundane explanation (unless you like US History!)",

Just a set of stairs with a base that went up maybe one flight. 16 or so steps if I remember right. And sturdy. Could barely Shake em. I didn't climb up though.

We get there around mid day and we set up, and relax. By now it begins to get dark so we decide to cook some food and call it a day after we eat. Now me, my cousin, and my brother, shared a tent to sleep in so I'd say around 2-3 am rolls around and I have to pee like a motherfucker. Anyways I do my stuff and head back to the tent to find the zipper wide open and my little brother gone. So I start freaking out and I wake my cousin up to tell him what happened and essentially we search until about sunrise and then we call the Rangers. They search for about 4-5 hour and they find him 10 miles away from our campsite and he has no clue how he got there all he has on is his underwear and nothing else now after this whole ordeal our cousin tells us about David Paulidas and his whole research on missing people's in national parks. Needless to say it was the most jarring and disturbing things that has ever happened in my life. It really in all honesty ruined camping for all of us and i had loved camping too. But needless to say Crater Lake is the place to go for some creepy paranormal shit. ",

            "comment": "Not SAR or \"elite\" hiker by any means. But my two stories - and I will post the \"reveals\" because they're honestly mundane.\n\nA few years back, with a large group of Scouts in Butano SP, we were hiking some godforsaken dense forest trail, in the wet california winter rains.  The first night, the racoons rolled a bunch of our bear containers down a gully into a creek. We were able to find them.  The second day, we encountered a road, and a checkpoint. The guard-booth was abandoned. There were no signs, but we concluded that it was an abandoned prison. We adults would have gone in there, but we didn't want to endanger the kids, so we hiked on.\n\nLater that night, right around 1am, I was awakened by the sound of gunfire. It was about 100 + yards away, and it was not pistols. It was some very loud, sharp, poppy guns. Different guns.  It started off slow, and then after a dozen, or so - a pause, then more, then it was steady for maybe 100+ or more, from several different guns.  Then when the other guns stopped, the loudest one kept firing, and it wasn't full-auto, but a lot of rapid fired shots.  Never got the count of the magazine between reloads, but this went on for about 20 minutes in total, then just stopped.  \n\nI got out of my sleeping bag, out of my tent, and hiked about 30 yards through the brush to the other campsite, in the dark, without my light on.  I didn't want anyone else to see me.  I got to the campsite, and the kids were all still asleep, but the other adults had heard it - had no idea what it was. Maybe pot farmers in a gunfight with intruders? Next morning, it was a topic of conversation, but most of the kids had actually slept through it.\n\nAfter we left and got home, I talked to the ranger; and they said that sometimes, people break into the prison, and use the old gun range (unauthorized).\n\nMy other story was camping in Big Sur; Silver Peak.  I was alone, but only about 5 miles from the road.\nI had just finished dinner, and lay down to sleep. After a few minutes, I heard kind of a \"crunch crunch crunch crunch\" sound, that sounded like foot steps outside. I moved my head to try to figure out what direction they were coming from, and they stopped.  I put my head back down, and a few minutes later, they started again.  \"crunch\" \"crunch\" \"crunch\" \"crunch\" - Again, I lifted my head to see what direction they were coming from, or whether it was close.  Nothing.  This cycle repeated a couple of times until I decided to turn over and open my tent flap to get a look around outside with the flashlight.  I was expecting to see a person out there, walking around in the dark, but I saw nothing. Heard nothing. Zipped up, put my head back down, tried to go back asleep.  \nAgain, \"crunch\" \"crunch\" \"crunch\" \"crunch\". Again, lifted my head, it stopped.  I tried to re-adjust, I looked outside again, I couldn't find the source.  It certainly wasn't my heart, because that was thumping like mad.  This kept me awake for hours that evening. I was terrified that there was someone or something out there; who heard my move my head, and stopped walking, only to continue, when they thought I had fallen back asleep. Maybe past midnight; but eventually I fell asleep.\n\nNext morning, I had breakfast, broke camp, and as I set up my tent, I noticed that my head was over a gopher hole.",

            "comment": "Man I have a bunch of these stories. I was in SAR as well, but all my creepy experiences have happened while camping or hiking. \n\nThis one's pretty tame...I almost always camp waaaay out, I'm talking 30-40 miles down unnamed dirt roads, up mountains, in canyons, etc. A couple years ago I was camping alone out on a prairie flat, halfway surrounded by a forest. It's nearly winter and there's not a soul within 50 miles I bet. My big hound dog was with me, as always. It was cooold, like well below freezing, so I had a roaring campfire going. Jake the dog was in &amp; out, he'd wander off for awhile, get cold, and come back for attention and warmth. He has a bell around his collar so I can know where he is. I'm drinking beer and listening to music, so I'm not paying much attention to his whereabouts. Mind you, it's pitch black out there other than the stars. So after about 20 minutes, I hadn't seen Jake, so I call him. Nothing. I turn off my music and call louder. Nothing for about 5 minutes. I hear his bell, so I'm relieved. I heard his bell behind me, which was odd, the treeline was in front of me, where he had been sniffing around earlier. Thinking he was nearby, I relaxed and refocused on chopping some more wood. I could faintly hear his bell jingling behind me still, sometimes closer or further, and I figured he was doing the hound dog's job and smelling all around. I'd say about 40 minutes goes by, and I hadn't heard his bell or seen him. So I call him again, and get up to walk towards the treeline. Big dark forest of ponderosa pine looms in front of me. I shine my fairly bright flashlight around and into the trees. Nothing. No sound, no sight. I'm starting to get nervous, getting \"the willies\" or whatever you want to call it. I hear some crunches in the woods, like sticks and stuff breaking. Not knowing where my dog is, or much of anything other than \"ok I'm going back to the fire where my shotgun is\". I get back to my truck and my fire when I hear absolute PANIC barking from directly in front of me, from the treeline. Tearing across the field is my dog at full tilt. You could never mistake a hound dog's panic bark from a bey or a yip or whatever else, it's unlike anything. He ran behind me for a moment, and then underneath my truck. Here's the creepy part: no bell. He had his collar on, and the bell was clipped to it with a carabiner. Sure as shit I put us both in the cab of the truck for the rest of that frozen night.  To this day I still have no clue who or what was wearing that bell behind me for a few hours on a rural prairie flat in winter. ",

It sounded exactly like my moms voice whispering and i could see the silhouette of whoever it was whispering and it looked just like my mom, but i knew it wasnt her because id just left the tent, where she was sleeping. I remember my heart pounding like i knew it wasnt my mom and it was something sinister but i responded and said \"yeah one minute, just gonna grab my coat\" because i didnt wanna upset her/it/whoever or whatever it was. \"Hurry up then\" the voice responded. I got in the tent and woke everyone in a crazed panic. My mom and step dad told me i must have sleep walked but i swear i remember it so vividly and i dont sleep walk and never have. At the time I knew in my head it was real. Im terrified of woods now. This is actually true btw and i try and tell my mom every now and then that i actually saw and heard what i said i did but she kinda dismisses it. If im honest, i dont really believe in the supernatural like ghosts and such, but i genuinely believe i almost got kidnapped or something that night, it disturbs me deeply because of the fact that whoever it was addressed me by my name.",

They can take on the appearance and or voice of anyone - often someone known to the victim. It is reported they will appear to people as someone familiar to try and lure them away from their dwelling or group. Or use their voice to sound like a loved one is in danger lure someone out of their home. ",

There was a large swing tied to a tree that we used to play on. Really it was a fire hose that someone tied to a branch and it stretched out over a ledge and kind of gave us a thrill looking down at the ground. We used to go after school a few times a week. One day for whatever reason i went alone to the swing but i never made it there. On the way I heard my mom calling my name, which was strange because she didn't even know where i was. When i looked up to see where it was coming from, I saw the biggest wolf anyone ever saw. It might've been a regular size wolf and i just remember it being huge since i was around 10 years old. As soon as i saw it i was paralyzed with fear. It was just staring at me from about 100 feet away, right on the trail to the swing. I kind of forgot about the voice i heard and slowly turned and walked away back to the log bridge i had to cross to get there.  years later I read about the skinwalkers and how they could mimic the voices of a loved one, and also the fact that they could turn into animals, usually wolves. I don't know if that's what i saw, but it still haunts me to this day. and by the way, I live in south jersey. There are no wolves in my area.",

Once while at my uncles house who lived in a more remote part of Wayne National, I was outside his house by myself and I hear this cackling like a cartoon witches laugh, except is was the most evil sounding thing I'd ever heard and it echoed all around the hills around  the house and it was super loud. I ran inside and told everyone but somehow nobody else heard it even though the windows to his house were open. I never went outside his house by myself after that and I was so happy when he moved from there several years later. \n\nOn a side not, this is the first time I've seen Wayne National mentioned on here despite everyone I know having a creepy story. There's lots of abandoned mines, home sites and creepy caves all over if you can find them. ",

These cases follow a specific pattern that involves circumstances which defy explanation/physics, and often involve a \"bear man\" creature (just like yours). In fact, I bet he would love to hear from you. He has written books on the subject (Missing 411 by Dave Paulides). Perhaps your stories could be investigated further and included in his next book? Most people just vanish completely. Finding someone alive after a strange disappearance like that is a very rare thing for him, and you have two such cases, so I guarantee that Mr. Paulides would love to open up files on them if at all possible. That is what he's up to these days. He's trying to get to the bottom of it this obvious pattern and being very thorough, but he says that there is absolutely no tracking system or database for these, and finds resistance when he inquires through official channels. It's like the people at the top know about this, but don't want it to get out. There are cases that go back 100 years. It's been happening as long as we've been keeping track. ",

It belonged to a widow who lived elsewhere, according to the older families in the area.. She and her husband had planned to build a house on it after razing the forest, but he died before the plans took root. \n\nWe used to ride our horses through the woods on dry days, and we always passed by this staircase that was leaned up on a tree a few miles in. There was never a house built there according to neighbors; the forest was too dense and old anyway. It always gave me the creeps and we jokingly called it the \"stairway to heaven\" to alleviate the tension when we rode by it. The horses weren't fans either; they got particularly spooky and snorty when we went to pass it. I'd always wondered what on earth it was doing there. ",

            "comment": "Scariest story I have is camping in northern Michigan with my dad. My grandma lived on lake in a house near Gaylord, MI which my parents and I would frequent every Friday through Sunday for well over a decade until my grandma sold the place. \n\nOur routine would be to pack up all necessary equipment for a 3 day camping trip and fit it into our rucks. Grab the mountain bikes and head off to one of the state forests. We then would find a random two track leading into the woods, particularly we always aimed for those that looked like they haven't been driven on in years due to overgrowth. Find a place to park, offload bikes and leave. General made our own trail when we couldS Goal was to find a stream or river and set up camp in any clearing we could find. Usually ended up just in a clearing as we never went more than 10-15 miles from the truck.\n\nOne time we actually came across an old foundation of in assuming was once a home. No trail or road remotely near for miles. Right on a stream. Made of rocks about the size of a brick. There was a small wooden shack idk maybe 10 feet or so from the foundation, maybe 4 or 4 1/2 feet tall. I remember my dad had to bend over and I just hunched (I was just a kid!) to get inside.\n\nInside were rusted out gun barrels galore. Fishing poles, snow shoes, bedding, old pots and pans, etc. Clearly the area hadn't been used in a very long time. Just cool stuff for for a 12 year old kid. \n\nWe setup camp about 20 feet away. Caught a few bullfrogs and cooked them up for dinner along with some pan fried nachos on the small Coleman we had with those old school mini propane tanks. No light pollution. The night sky was amazing. Could see so many stars. To this day my favorite part of camping is after dark. That night shortly before we went to bed, we tied up all of our food and hung it up about 15 feet or so in the air over a branch like you see in movies. Keep bear and other animals out of it essentially. Our normal nightly routine.\n\nShortly after we zipper the tent up to get some sleep we started hearing grunting and huffing sounds coming from across the stream. Dad being a avid hunter says it's likely a deer or elk, maybe a bear. Which, we have seen all of these and more on our trips. Sound carries pretty far so dad wasn't too concerned. We hear it throughout the night but the sounds started getting almost baby like. The only way I can describe it is imagine a baby whining softly. Add this with very deep huffs and grunting. Periodically we would bear a high pitched, sharp but very short cry. Sounded to me like a baby screaming. Just creepy. \n\nThroughout the night these sounds come and go. Dad loaded the Remington and I had my little 20 gauge small game ready to go just in case.  (My first gun and my first time taking it with us on one of our trips) We eventually fell asleep. \n\nWe wake up to nothing too out of the ordinary except a stench of rotting meet, like a dead animal. We figured an animal died and we just could smell it on the wind. We would come across coyote kills sometimes or some other animals so we didn't think anything of it. We go outside to a beautiful sunrise and the sound of flies. Dad just figure we lost the food and the flies are on it now.\n\nDad walks around back by the food bag and stops abruptly and just says, I still remember it, very slowly a \"what....the....fuck...\" Behind our tent are three deer strung up, skinned and gutted. The deer were hung on three different branches on the same tree our bag was on, which was untouched. Each head was cut off and set on top of the guts. Each head was pointed  directly at our tent. No one around. No foot prints, no blood trail, nothing. Just three deer, hanging by vine. Not twine or rope, vines. Dad grabbed the gun and went to try and spot tracks or blood. He is a phenomenal tracker and has been a guide on a few occasions for \"experience\" hunts in the U.P.. He found nothing. We heard nothing in the night either.\n\nCreepy as shit. I was incredibly spooked. Dad was too as we packed up that Saturday and headed back the the truck. No incidents on the way back. Just a normal half day trip back the truck. Drove to DNR station and Reported it. \n\nI just remember the guy looking at me, then my dad, shaking his head slowly and picking up the phone to call whoever and all he said was something like \"another skinned animal sighting near the whatever steam.\" Clearly it happened before but what the hell. Dad never did find out if it was someone or something. The fact that my dad couldn't find any blood spotting or trails where those deer would have been dragged or hoof prints where they perhaps walked is what to this day said baffles him the most. We still talk about it over a beer every now and then. He also doesn't know where the vines came from because he looked all around the area and there were no trees with any vines anywhere around.\n\n\n\n\n",

The way people seem to instantly vanish, and cannot be located immediately in the vicinity, as well as how often it's been people who were at the end of a line. Other factors that often crop up are the number of people who go missing with their dogs. How many of the people who are found are missing their shoes. The rate of people who go missing while out picking berries, to name another, is also pretty high apparently.\n\nAs well as the people who go missing and are found, they cannot say what happened to them, many times because they are very young, or even if they are adults their memories of what happened are clouded. One woman who was found reported she had seen other people while lost but no one seemed able to see *her.*\n\nIn addition, there are certain areas of just one or two or three-miles, around the country, including National Parks where higher numbers of people go missing, in clusters. Gradually, over time, not enough to alarm law enforcement immediately but enough to show patterns.\n\nPaulides has in his books on the subject expressed alarm at the number of people, over time, that go missing from some of our National Parks. Hundreds of people go missing, and aren't found. Or they are found, very far away from where they went missing with no real clues as to how they ended up in sometimes inhospitable areas you'd think someone couldn't just bumble into. \n\nOr the people who are found only a short distance away from where they disappeared, after extensive searching failed to find anything before that. No one's really keeping track of the numbers. You have to go digging to discover these elements.\n\nA couple of park rangers met with Paulides and acknowledged -- privately -- that the disappearances of people over time wasn't getting any media attention.

            "comment": "&gt;A few times, I've been out on my own searching with a canine, and they've tried to lead me straight up cliffs. Not hills, not even rock faces. Straight, sheer cliffs with no possible handholds. It's always baffling, and in those cases we usually find the person on the other side of the cliff, or miles away from where the canine has led us. I'm sure there's an explanation, but it's sort of strange.\n\nThis happens because of thermals and scent drift. The rising sun will heat up the person's scent cone and cause it to become more of a thick column lofting into the sky. Then, as breezes carry it elsewhere, the air cools and the scent will fall back down in the evening and settle in gullies and ravines. Then, if the weather becomes warmer, it will climb straight up a cliff wall because the wall is warmer in comparison to the surrounding air and the scent is basically being sucked upwards by the warmer cliff face.",

The trail was getting steeper and thinner the further we went, and every now and then we'd see another trail crossing our path. Our crewleader just had us bris it up, and wouldn't let us explore them like usual. Said we were too far in, and that he had a funny feeling. We all did, but we kept going, cause the day was still young.\n\nEventually we rounded a corner and saw them, just a set of five steps in the middle of the wood. We looked around, saw that there was no good reason to have a set of steps there, and gave the nod to our ax man. He hops up with his ax and destroies it. Completely.\n\nWe got out of there just fine, though. Still felt funny about it the next day, but it's almost like a dream, now.",

Only 20 minutes to get home. He sees a deer in the middle of the road and it wasn't scared when he drove by. He was worried it would get hit so he flipped a U turn and came up slowly as it wouldn't budge. It had it's head pointed to the ground like a dog sniffing at something so he rolled his window down to yell right in it's face. It raised it's head slowly and there was no face. He was so scared he couldn't even drive off, and telling me about it he was so scared he had to grab his shotgun just to feel safer. He said it turned around and ran off after a second of \"staring\" at him, but it had no facial features. And I don't mean like, face ripped off, I mean just smooth nothingness. \nIn the same area another time, my friends and I were driving to another friend's house but deeper into the woods. We were only going maybe 10mph because it was so dark, and suddenly she slams the breaks on and screams. On the side of the road was tall elephant grass, maybe 10 feet high or so, a LOT of it. Sticking out was the back half of what looked like a dog (rear end, tail, hind legs). It had a long shaggy tail, the fur was black, and it truly looked like the build of maybe a skinny great dane. The kicker was the the top of it's rear end was well over 5 feet tall, which is how tall I am. We all screamed, and it loped into the woods. Never saw the front end!",

                            "comment": "Omg. This is literally the first time I've ever seen/heard anything similar to a story I heard once. \n\nOne of my college roommates told me this one. Let's call her Julie. Her boyfriend at the time had a few encounters with these \"faceless\" deer. She asked me about it because I was big into the creepy stuff and ghost stories and I could generally shine a little light on stuff, even just saying that I'd heard something similar once. I researched for a long time before giving up on this one. I had never heard of anything similar, and I couldn't find any reference to a faceless deer, deer without eyes, even a ghost deer. Nothing until this comment. \n\nThe guy in question I only met a handful of times and I never asked him about it myself to see if I felt like he was pulling Julie's leg. But she swore up and down he was serious because she was on the phone with him when he saw them once. And honestly, he didn't come off as a jokester type. I wish I had brought it up though. \n\nApparently every now and then, while driving home at night (no particular rhyme or reason. No full moon, specific part of the year, etc) he would pass this one part of the road where he would see a group of deer. Always does, no fawns or bucks. The first time it happened, he slowed down and watched them (he loooooved his car, didn't want to wreck). He said they just watched him as he drove by, but it wasn't until he was fairly close that he saw they didn't have eyes, just skin/fur over the eye sockets. He was always super creeped out and would often call Julie after seeing them. \n\nOne time, Julie said he was on the phone with her while driving and he was coming up on that part of the road. He wasn't looking for them because he was distracted. My roommate said he suddenly starts yelling and cussing up a storm and she can hear him squeal to a stop. She's trying to ask him what's going on and he yelled \"THE DEER! THAT %*~]\u00a5\u20ac?=}~ DEER JUMPED OUT AND HIT MY {+&lt;\u20ac}\u00a5+ CAR!!!\" He said it hit right on the nose of the car and the head whipped up so he had a clear sight of its face for a second, eyeless sockets and all, and then it rolled off to the side while he swerve to a halt. He got out to check the car and see how bad the damage was. \n\nNothing. Not a single scratch or dent. No blood. \n\nAlso no deer. We were all 18-19 at the time so driving fast was \"cool.\" I have no doubt he was going plenty fast enough to leave some road kill. And if anyone has ever experienced it witnessed the aftermath of hitting a deer like that, getting away without a trip to the shop just doesn't happen. \n\nThat was also the last time he saw the deer by the time my period of living with Julie was up (just 1 semester). If anything has happened since, I wouldn't know. \n\nI still think about this story from time to time and wonder. I was shocked to see a reference to faceless deer in these comments. I'm actually a little excited to. It's one of the few things I've ever heard of that I couldn't only find a single story of (that being the one I heard from Julie). ",

            "comment": "I'll tell you that I lived out in a very rural area growing up.  There was a mountain and plenty of woods around us.  We had neighbors and all that but they were far enough away that you could just see their houses.   We had a pitbul named Buster out in the back who had a nice doghouse and plenty of room to run around and play.  There was a nice fenced in area where he couldn't just run off.  One night I awoke to this loud screaming.  I swear it sounded like a woman almost.  It was terrifying and sounded like something painful was happening to whatever was making that sound.  In panic I thought about Buster and grabbed a .357 magnum that my father gave me for my 18th birthday.  Without getting dressed I ran to the kitchen to get to the back door so I could check it out.  Fortunately my father was awake and had his shotgun and a big spotlight.  We could hear rustling way out back and more of that damned screaming.  We started running towards the noise only to spot Buster face up against the fence and screaming an angry, \"I'm gonna kill you\" type of bark that a dog only does when they feel threatened or if they've been attacked.   We could hear what sounded like limping for a bit and then it stopped.   Buster calmed down after a few minutes and we were scanning the treeline like crazy.  Finally Buster walked away and went to his bed.  We decided to let him go into the house that night.  It was a nice summer night, but we didn't want to wake up again in case anything happened.  When I got Buster to my bedroom his inside dog bed was layed out at the foot of my bed.  He went to lay down and I went back to sleep.  The next morning I woke up and looked at him and found that he had scratch markes all over his body.  Two puncture wounds on his back left thigh as well.  I rushed him to the vet and he was given antibiotics and some some other medication.  I went to where he was and found a blood trail.  Turns out he got into a scuffle with a big wildcat.  Found it dead about 50-60 yards away from the fence.  It lost too much blood and died.  Not scary or interesting I guess but it freaked me out that night.",

He often stole kids, or messing with people who lost in woods, he is not kind, even more, he's very unfriendly to people, for example he often make people \"lost\", he can change forest's landscape, he can create haze and stuff like that, most likely if you meet him out there in the woods, you have all of the chances to disappear completely, like those people from stories.\nBack then, when old Russian Empire (not USSR/ or Russian Federation) wasn't yet into religion of Jesus Christ people were really close to nature and they could easily fight such creatures with rituals,or if they were in trouble they're just started to pray to Gods of forest so they're protected people from such creature's. But nowadays it's all gone and probably if you will be unlucky enough to meet such creature today, you are dead men, so be very careful next time when you'll be in the woods.",

I was alone in the woods of Canada with nothing but a ration kit and a knife. they even took our belts so we couldn't hang ourselves if we lost it ( we did this as a unit but we were each at least 5 miles apart). late one night I was having some serious trouble sleeping, my shelter was rustling but there was no wind, that's when the coughs began. I was freaking out trying to dismiss it as one of my platoon mates hunting in the woods or something (even though we were explicitly told to stay within visual range of our shelter.) I decide to investigate the sound and look toward the entangled door of my shelter...a bare foot with frayed jeans at the ankle...after reading the black Eyed man story 20 minutes ago I still have chills running down my spine.",

But what I'd add to that would be a good, hi tensile, full tang fixed blade, a hands free headlamp or cap light, &amp; salt. Muscle cramps are life threatening in the wild, hence The Eleventh Essential should be salt. I'd also instruct that all food should be stored in a bear proof can &amp; that can, with every scrap of food &amp; your trash, should be stowed away from your tent at all times. NEVER eat inside or near, or have food anywhere near your tent. Never go alone. Always tell someone where you're going, the trail you're hitting, where you'll start, the direction you're heading, where you're coming out &amp; when you'll be back. It's a good idea to leave that info in your car at the trail head too in case it's the only thing found of you. If you get lost, stay put! If you want to live, you'll relay that info before going and you will be found. If you're ambition's to die, or disappear forever, don't tell anyone where you're going. That one step truly is your pass or fail. Also watch every step: snakes. And wear a hat at all times, especially under a forest canopy. Ticks are not a joke. One bite from the wrong tick and your health can be tarnished for life. Filter or boil your water for safety no matter how fresh or clean looking. Bad water can give you long term, life altering health problems too. ",

            "comment": "So I joined Reddit just so I could post this comment. And read more nosleep stories of course, but still. \nAnyway, I used to work at a lot of conventions when I was about 20. I lived in the Delaware valley. My manager lived in upstate PA and there were a lot of car, truck &amp; hunting shows that way that his agency would book shows for us. Anyway, my parents were out of town and I was watching their dog, Blue. He was an 80 lb English shepherd and an alpha. He didn't respect me much but he would have died protecting me bc he knew I was pack. Anyway, there was a show that weekend and I usually stayed at my manager's house in his guest house for the weekend shows. I had to take my dog w me since I was watching him. \n\nI got there the Friday before the convention and took my dog for a walk down the road. It was dusk and gorgeous and way more wooded and secluded than my hometown so I was enjoying it. We walked a fair way down the road and then I decided to take him off the path and into a little clearing I could vaguely see through the trees. So we get into this clearing and there is lots of tall grass and it is dusk so visibility is low. He is sniffing around and generally enjoying himself and then at the same time we both notice the grass at the opposite side of the clearing moving (probably 200-300 ft away). He immediately stiffens and lets out this visceral growl that I have never heard him make before. Not just the \"someone is at the door\" growl, but a \"our lives are in immediate danger and I will attack and kill if need be\" growl. So I start getting nervous and back up a bit. I'm thinking from the size of the movement (the grass was a little over waist high) that it's maybe a cougar or wolf or whatever my imagination is scaring me with. In retrospect I WISH it was a cougar or wolf. Anyway, I am trying to get Blue out of the clearing and back to the road but he is frozen stiff and not budging. He is in full flight or fight mode and he's obviously chosen the latter. The thing is moving around, kind of foraging and what seems to be looking for food. While it's moving back and forth I catch a glimpse of it really fast through a sparse area of grass and it looks seriously like one of the werewolves from tv. It was mostly naked with a ridge of fur down its back and it's face kind of looked like a hyena. In all honesty it could have been a huge dog or wolf with mange. But it's legs were all wrong. Most canine-like animals walk on their toes with the first bend in their legs being their ankle. The second bend is their knee, and their hips aren't visible the way ours are. So their legs look like this:\n&lt;\n _&gt;\n(Poor rendering, I know). \nAnyway, this thing's legs were backwards. It's feet pointed backwards and the first bend in it's leg pointed forwards. The second (that should have been it's knee) pointed backwards. Like this:\n   &gt;\n&lt;_\nSo, I dragged my dog by the scruff of his neck and jogged home at a brisk pace. \nIt never noticed we were there. My only logical explanation was that maybe it was a large dog or wolf with mange and a severe genetic defect. But I have done a lot of work in dog rescue and I've never seen a defect like that. That being said, it might exist, but any kind of defect I've ever seen of that magnitude has rendered the dog immobile. This thing was walking and trotting like nobody's business. \nStill don't know WTF that thing was and would prefer there to be a logical explanation but I haven't really found one. ",

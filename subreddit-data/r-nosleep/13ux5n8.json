    "postText": "I spent the remainder of the evening after the \"hike\" sorting out my thoughts. Trying to, at any rate. Writing it all down helped, but I was still exhausted and confused. \n\nI woke up in Frankie Preston's bed the following morning. I instantly knew it wasn't mine due to the lack of Dorito crumbs in the sheets. Even so, it took me a while to come to. Once I'd rubbed my eyes and untangled myself from the blanket, I found the man himself sitting upright beside me, fully dressed with his shoes on, presently reading a book. \"Morning, Sunshine,\" he muttered, not looking up. \"There's water on the nightstand for you. A muffin, too. I wasn't sure what to get.\"\n\nI let out an incoherent murmur to which he huffed a laugh and rested his hand on the side of my face. \"You were still as a rock, you know.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for messing up last night,\" I said, my voice cracked and dry from sleep. \"I shouldn't have gone looking for trouble. I should've stayed low and just watched those two.\"\n\n\"What's with that tone? I'm not about to lecture you. I get wanting to take revenge. You did fine as far as I'm concerned. And I think Markov is okay with everything, too. After all, any proceedings against the Collective are highly legitimate now or whatever. Plus, she got that lady cultist in custody now, and she's looking forward to the interrogation. She called and explained it to me on the phone earlier, but I wasn't paying attention.\" He shrugged to himself and I reached up to tug aside his book's cover. \"It's *Wuthering Heights*,\" he told me, gently removing my hand. I tried to grab it again, but he pulled it out of my reach. \"Oh!\" He sounded amused as he finally set the book aside to hug me. \"You could have just said something.\"\n\n\"Don't you have to work today?\"\n\n\"I called in sick. Of course, my six moms know I don't actually get sick so they'll suspect something's up. They're probably gonna be all over me.\"\n\n\"You never get sick?\" I inquired.\n\n\"No. It's one of the nicer aspects of inhuman nature.\"\n\n\"I'm still not getting any answers on that?\"\n\n\"Don't worry, you will. Sooner or later.\"\n\nWe went out and took a walk in the park, which was equally weird and nice. It seemed such a normal thing to do. It was a bright, nearly windless day, and the sun shining down on us provided a gentle warmth. The previous days' rain had left the trees heavily laden with drops of water. Occasionally, some would dislodge from the leaves and branches they occupied and plop down on our heads. \n\nI asked Frankie whether he would be alright with checking in on Nettie Peterson together. He chuckled, joking that she would probably just *love* to see him, but ultimately agreed. Once my best friend was due to be off work, we went around to her house.\n\nStrangely enough, the most drastic changes in other people seem to happen without me really being there to witness them. Kit Sutton had somehow turned into a somewhat responsible roommate without me even noticing. Before I knew it, we had become friends. When my savior human opened the door for us, I felt distinctly reminded of that other development. Nettie, not unlike a butterfly emerging from whatever they call that odd little sleeping bag caterpillars make for themselves, had apparently come out of her dark state of mind all by herself. Her eyes lit up when she saw me and she wheedled us inside with much the same enthusiasm I was used to. She had us sit down in the garden while she tended to her flowers. \n\nI watched her closely. Her skin had regained much of its healthy glow, her hair was washed and shiny, the clothes she wore clean\u2014a flowing blouse, mom jeans and sneakers. She had clearly picked them out with care, like she normally did. It was good to see her restored to her old self, but I couldn't help but feel like something was wrong.\n\n\"Are you sure you're okay?\" I asked. \n\n\"I have to be, don't I?\" she replied, her cheerful tone coming out more forced than she'd likely intended. She was cutting away crushed and wilted leaves from one of her small bushes, shaping it in the process. \"It's over. Life goes on.\"\n\n\"Does it?\" I tilted my head at her.\n\n\"Can we talk about anything else? Literally anything?\" The snapping movements of her garden shears came faster; more forceful. Frankie Preston and I exchanged uncomfortable looks. Figuring it would make for an interesting topic, I proceeded to tell Nettie about our exploits the night before. Halfway through my story, she had ceased her plant styling activities, blankly staring at me from where she sat on the ground. By the time I was done, she had taken off her rubber gloves and was slowly massaging her temples. \n\n\"One of these days, Eva. One of these days, you're gonna give me a heart attack. I don't even want to ask about what you get up to anymore, I think. I'm afraid of the answer.\" She threw Fran a grateful glance. \"Thank you for getting her out of there safely.\"\n\nThe waiter smiled placidly. \"Sure.\" Turning to me, he added in a whisper, \"So we're not going to mention that you saved me from the FunFlair guys twice before this?\"\n\nI grinned mildly and shook my head before assuming a more serious tone. \"Nettie, it's great that you're all better, but you were really down before. If this is just an act, I'd prefer you didn't put it on.\"\n\n\"It's not an act,\" she said sternly, raising her hands to her hips. \"I've resigned myself. That's all. There's nothing to be done, I've accepted it and I've moved on.\"\n\n\"That can't be healthy,\" Frankie remarked. \"You know what would help? Punishing the world in some way. You could take it out on your kindergarteners. Tell them a scary story so their parents have to stay up all night with them. Incite a dirt throwing fight and send them home all muddy. Set up a boxing ring and have them go at each other like in a dog fight. Wouldn't that be far more rewarding than sucking it up?\"\n\nNettie Peterson looked unimpressed. Her dark eyes roamed the young man like she was trying to gauge whether or not he was serious. \"You're some kind of sociopath, aren't you?\"\n\nThat she shouldn't have said. Frankie's serene expression morphed into his customer service smile. I don't know when I started deciphering this being's voice and countenance, but there I was, picking up on the spiteful undertone in what he said next.\n\n\"I'm just saying, if the woman *I* fancied disappeared in such a way, I'd find outlets for my grief.\" His eyes darted over to Nettie as if to ensure she'd heard him correctly before settling on me, observing my reaction. All I could do however was stare at my best friend.\n\nHer glossy lips had parted. She met my gaze, her thick, expressive brows rising a good deal. \"I\u2026\" she began, faltering and starting to fumble for words. \"That's to say, Kit was\u2026 we, um\u2026\"\n\n\"Oh, Eva didn't know?\" Frankie asked, perfectly flat and monotonous. \"I had no idea it was a secret. I'm sorry, it wasn't my place to say. I wouldn't have mentioned it, really.\"\n\nSomething about that sent a chill down my spine. I shot him a glare, to which he drew himself up and turned away. Meanwhile, Nettie finally broke from her stupor and blurted out, \"We were together, okay?\"\n\nFor a moment, I sat quietly. \u201cFrank, please go home,\u201d I said at length, not quite looking at him. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later. *We will.*\u201d\n\nHe looked like he wanted to say something, but quickly thought better of it, rising to his feet and storming off. Ignoring the queasy feeling in my stomach, I walked over to Nettie and plopped down on the ground beside her. \u201cSo that\u2019s what this was about,\u201d I began.\n\nMy savior human nodded meekly. \u201cWe\u2026 we didn\u2019t want to tell you. Not for the time being, at least. We hadn\u2019t defined the relationship yet, i-it was all so new and weird, *I felt weird*, but it was good, you know? I just wasn\u2019t ready to think about it that way yet. And you\u2019ve only ever seen me date guys, I didn\u2019t know what you\u2019d think\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought anything,\u201d I replied. \u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot long. She called me up before she came back to you a couple weeks ago. That\u2019s kind of when we started seeing each other in\u2026 in *that* way.\u201d\n\n\u201cRomantically?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nI hesitantly extended a hand to caress her upper arm, locking eyes with her. There was a profound sadness in her expression, a watery gleam. She took a deep breath. \u201cBefore that, we used to text back and forth occasionally. I always felt kind of weird about her. Somehow, she got under my skin everytime she was goofing off, what with her little jokes and all. We kept talking, though. I was always so irritated when she was around, and that\u2019s so unlike me, I just ended up wondering\u2026 And then when she showed up here, it all kind of came together. W-we did. She stuck around and we spoke and everything simply *made sense* all of a sudden. I didn't know she liked me, too.\u201d She swallowed audibly, her voice brittle and husky as she went on. \u201cKit isn't like anyone else I\u2019ve ever had feelings for.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot like anyone else, as in\u2026 a woman?\u201d I prompted, raising a brow.\n\nNettie grunted. \u201cOh, shush! Don't make me feel guilty for being hesitant at first. I know it\u2019s not a big deal to *you*, but try going through life believing you\u2019re straight and suddenly running into some cute ditzy punk girl and realizing you\u2019re *not*. It\u2019s all sorts of confusing, believe me. I was scared it was gonna be weird because it was my first time with a woman but Kit somehow made it easy. It was a bit of a whirlwind, sure, but it felt natural and\u2026 just *good*.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you tell Eli?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. But I think he suspected. That man knows me like the back of his hand. We\u2019re basically siblings, remember? He was always tactful, never really pressured me into admitting anything, but he made a couple puns here and there, so\u2026 I do believe he knew.\u201d She fumbled with her limp gloves, fixing me with a wavering smile. \u201cSo?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d \n\n\u201cIs there something you want me to say?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m only glad I understand now. I wish you\u2019d told me sooner, but that\u2019s your business. Also, I didn\u2019t tell you that I\u2019ve been running around with our waiter, so I guess we\u2019re essentially even. By the way, I\u2019m sorry he put you on the spot like that. You didn\u2019t deserve that. How did he know about you two anyways?\u201d\n\nNettie pursed her lips. \u201cHe might have seen us around the diner or something. I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m, uh, not gonna comment on whatever you two got going on. You know what you\u2019re doing. Hopefully.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, thanks. Then I won\u2019t be giving my opinion on whether or not I consider that deadbeat dork Kit to be worthy of you.\u201d\n\nMy savior human snorted. \u201cMuch appreciated. Though I guess it\u2019s not really an issue anymore either way.\u201d\n\nI shook my head. \u201cDon\u2019t think like that. We can\u2019t let her go. I certainly won\u2019t, not after this.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nI rose to my feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to drag her blue ass back out of the ocean and have her make an honorable woman of you.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t believe she thought I was serious. The realization had set in by the time I\u2019d dragged her down to the beach with me, though. We had taken Wammawink for the drive. Wammawink is the name of Nettie\u2019s pastel pink motor scooter. It has a sidecar, which she straps me into with great care whenever we ride. It took her about twenty minutes to get us down to the shore. The more I talked about possibly retrieving my roommate, the brighter and realer the shine in her eyes became. Hope was not yet dead, that much was for certain. I led her down the cliffside and past the rocky expanse to where the concert had been held. It seemed ages ago. Some wistful part of me thought I could hear the faint sound of Kits singing above the gentle murmur of the waves.\n\nThe beach was golden in the afternoon sunlight. The sleepy tide sent water steadily dribbling into the sand beneath our feet, the drier patches giving way ever so slightly as we walked along. The faint outline of a plan had taken shape in my mind. We headed for the grotto. \n\n\"It makes sense now,\" I thought aloud. \"The creature we fought at the concert was targeting you. The deep ones must have known that you two had a bond.\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" she replied uncertainly, eyeing the maw that opened up in the natural stone wall before us. \"Going spelunking will help us how, exactly\u2026?\"\n\n\"I figure it tried to take you in there for a reason. This place has to be special. If you want, you can always wait here, but I'd prefer to have you with me. I only want to look around a bit. Maybe there's a clue of sorts on how we can contact Kit.\"\n\nShe sighed. \"Now I know why you wanted me to bring my flashlight.\" She produced the object in question and handed it over before linking arms with me. \"Of course I'll stick with you.\"\n\nThe inside of the cave was far too quiet for comfort. The eerie silence was only broken by the occasional plinking of water dripping from the walls and ceiling. We made an effort to step around the puddles glittering on the bumpy ground as we proceeded into the dimness. The sunlight threading through the grotto's mouth didn't reach very far, so we were glad for the bright beam of our torch. I let it travel the hollowed rock, the light crinkling oddly as it reflected off the pools of water that seemed to grow larger the further we got. Nettie Peterson was hanging onto my arm, her grip growing a little tighter with every passing minute. Her face was a set mask of grim determination, belied by the nervous twitch of her eyelid and the occasional quiver of her lower lip.\n\nMy own discomfort was undeniable as well. My heart was thundering in my chest and clammy beads of perspiration were running down my face. Every step we took caused a dull thud, the echo of which bounced off the rough stone walls to be funneled by the length of the cave. There were several smaller passages leading off into all directions, but Nettie and I agreed on always picking the largest entrance. This way, the path we took was far easier to memorize and there was little possibility of getting lost. After the third or fourth time we ducked through one of the doorframe-like archs, we were met with an imposing sight. A large room with high ceilings opened up before us. There was natural light seeping through several small cracks overhead. Stringy, pale plant life hung down or clung to the walls. A round lake filled up its entire bottom half. \n\nBoth Nettie and I stopped in our tracks. There was no solid ground to walk on anymore. On top of that, the beauty of this subterranean body of water had literally stunned us. Ripples were rolling off the center of its surface, casting a faint shimmer onto the ceiling. The stone-filtered light from outside set the lake aglow, bright speckled dancing across it like sprightly wisps. All I could do was taken in a soft, reverent breath while the very thoughts running through my head escaped Nettie's trembling lips.\n\n\"Have you ever seen something so beautiful?\"\n\nI would have told her yes, but I truly could not remember when. Unfortunately, the lake also appeared to form something of a dead end. I considered turning and checking out another passage, only for my savior human to point out a ledge running along the side of the room. It was narrow, but no doubt wide enough for the two of us to walk it single-file. We clambered up the shelf-like protrusion and, hand in hand, began to move along. It was bumpy and wet, and I almost regretted continuing this way. I couldn't seem to properly place my feet, my soles slipping a few inches with every step. Glancing over my shoulder, I could tell from Nettie's grim expression that she was experiencing similar difficulties. My pulse was racing, my lower lip caught between my teeth as I attempted to focus on safely making it across. \n\nThe cold sweat that leaves my palms was actively working against me at this point, and before I could react, the flashlight had slipped through my shaking fingers. It bounced off a bump in the shelf, then rolled off the edge entirely to disappear in the dark water with a thick, loud *plop*. I cursed, turning to Nettie with an apologetic expression. \n\n\"It's fine,\" she assured me, squeezing my hand. \"It's bright enough here as it is and we'll still have our phones for light later.\" \n\nI smiled gratefully, about to take my next step when a deep, guttural gurgle came rumbling up from the depths of the lake. The sound hovered in the damp, salty air for a moment or two. My best friend and I froze in place, her grip on my hand turning into an iron vice. For a split second, I believe even my own heartbeat stilled. \n\n\"What was that?\" Nettie Peterson whispered, her voice barely audible over the sudden charged hum of the water below. Her question would not remain unanswered for long. The droning noise of vast water masses shifting began to fill the air as from deep, deep beneath, something made its way up. My savior human and I helplessly pressed our backs up against the wall, trying to keep steady against the force of the vibration shuddering through the rock. The ledge we were standing on was quaking as though the cave itself had come alive and was trying to throw us into this growling, cold abyss. \n\nWithin seconds, the *thing* broke the surface, causing enormous splashes and sending countless drops of water raining down on us. I blinked them out of my eyes just in time to see it *unfurl*.\n\nIt was not a living being in its entirety, merely part of one. That however only made the sight before us all the more terrifying. Simply put, it was a human arm. Just not of any human I had ever encountered. It was enormous; every webbed finger of the hand it ended in was about my size. There were six of them, each bending in far too many places\u2014I thought I could count as many as eight joints on the longest one. Its nails were more like claws, long and sharp with what looked like barnacles growing underneath them. The thin, nearly translucent skin between its fingers was stony gray, just like the rest of it. The hand slowly began to grope around, searching the walls of the cave. I knew right then and there that I couldn't possibly fight it. If it came to it, I'd try to hold it off with everything I had, but something this huge couldn't possibly be defeated. We had to flee, as long as we still could.\n\n\"Oh God,\" Nettie breathed. \"Oh God, oh God, oh God\u2026\" Her hand was trembling in mine.\n\n\"Quick,\" I hissed. \"Turn around, we gotta get out of here!\"\n\nShe nodded helplessly, her eyes blown wide in terror. When she began her retreat from the ledge, she nearly took up running. I pulled her close just in time to prevent her from slipping. \"Watch out!\" I uttered, unable to suppress the fear in my tone. \"Don't slip, we're dead if we fall in.\" \n\nMy savior human let out a whine, then took a deep breath and bit her lip. Slowly but steadily, she placed each foot in front of the other, leading us off the ledge. My ears were ringing. I couldn't tear my gaze away from the gigantic arm as it blindly felt along the walls, its nails coaxing a grating sound as they scratched upon the rocks. It was getting closer and closer, the side of its thumb nearly brushing the top of my head for a split second before I could withdraw. I had to press my eyes shut for a moment as my chest tightened painfully. Finally, we had reached the end of the shelf and wasted no time in jumping off. \n\nWe didn't even bother with any cell phone flashlights. As soon as we were on solid ground again, we darted through the entrance of the room, back through all of our carefully chosen passages before finally staggering out the mouth of the cave into the sunlight. We were panting like dogs; Nettie was forced to crouch down and sit still for a while to catch her breath. Meanwhile, I was seeing stars. Colorful dots and sparks of lightning seemed to dance before my inner eye as I blinked furiously into the afternoon sun. \n\n\"What the fuck was that?\" my best friend, having regained her ability to speak, rasped out. \n\nI turned to face her, my knees wobbling like jello. \"I have no idea.\"\n\n\"You think it\u2026 you think that fish person from the concert was trying to take me there? Dump me into that lake?\" She lowered her voice. \"It would have fed me to that giant thing, wouldn't it.\"\n\nI held her gaze, my mind racing. \"I don't know. Maybe the giant's different.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I think we might have just seen Kit's father.\"\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13dr5g0/help_im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[2: deadbeat roommate](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13eovqy/im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_also_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[3: creepy crush](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13fnc4u/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_everyone/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[4: relocation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13gjpwd/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_does_anybody/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[5: beach concert](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13heih5/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[6: First date](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ib2es/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_my_first/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[7: Temp work](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ja7jx/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_temp_work/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[8: roommate talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13k8088/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_a_talk_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[9: a dismal worldview](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13l69a9/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_the_world/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[10: warehouse](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13m8e9w/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[11: staircase](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13o0npw/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_we_visited_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[12: explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13p2dw3/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_we_might/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[13: hurt](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13q2hrx/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_i_should_not/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[14: hospital](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13r0f31/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_i_dont_like/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[15: ocean](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13s762l/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_the_day_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[16: diner](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13t8gny/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_i_may_have/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[17: government work](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13u20f7/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_so_this_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[19: I sat in a shopping cart for most of this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13w22mm/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_i_sat_in_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

I have to agree, Frankie's behavior has not been good recently, but I also think he's in a lot of pain....I think that move was a dick move totally, yet wouldn't just throw the whole man out the window for it...he's been charismatic, attentive, kind and supportive before, and even though I also believe it's wise to keep an eye open for potential new dangerous behaviors, I also think he must be going through something else, and he's not used to have such a close relationship. Somehow, Netti'es connection with OP made him feel threathened, I think...hope OP tells us more soon.\n\nAlso, where do you see OP's stabber described as a man? I re-read it again and I'm just trying to see if I glossed over something, but they're never described as a \"he\", but a \"they\" consistently. Guess it's too soon to be sure of their gender, don't you? It's wise for OP to not circle to \"men\" her radar, she might skip the right person!",

I think she could definitely use reminders that she doesn't always have to take care of *everyone* to be worth loving, and I think Kit was/is good for her in that way. \n\nFrankie is starting to worry me. I'm having trouble articulating it, but I think learning more about FunFlair would help you put his behaviour and the way he makes you feel into context. He's supposedly \"defective\" - I wonder if that has anything to do with his violent impulses or his mean streak.",

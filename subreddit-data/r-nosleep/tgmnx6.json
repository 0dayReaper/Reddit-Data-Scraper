    "postText": "My husband went missing six months ago. Just... went out to work one day and never came home. It was a horrible shock to the whole neighbourhood, because things like that just didn't happen in our little slice of white-picket-fence suburbia. The police launched an investigation, and the neighbourhood watch sent out search parties, but no one ever found any evidence to indicate what had happened to him. Our families were devastated. Recently, the missing posters have been taken down or papered over. The updates from the police became less frequent and dwindled away. I accepted that, hard as it was to admit, my Rick wasn't coming back. \n\nUntil he did. \n\nA week ago, I was in the back garden watering my petunias when I heard the garden gate creak open. I jerked my head in that direction and- there he was. Exactly the same as he was the day he disappeared. Same windswept blond hair and bright blue eyes, same curl to his pink lips. I was in shock. Our families had mourned for him, and yet there he was, standing in our garden like he had just popped out for milk or something. When I asked where he had been, he said he didn't know. He couldn\u2019t remember anything about the last six months. \n\nAll our family and friends are beside themselves with joy. They almost can't believe it. But that's just the thing: I don't believe it. \n\nLook, I understand how crazy this all sounds, I do. Our families would never believe me, and I can\u2019t go to the police unless I want to end up in a straightjacket. But I just know that the man sleeping next to me isn't my husband. I don't know what to do. I know I should be happy, but I'm not. I'm terrified. I don\u2019t know much about anything supernatural or paranormal, I don't even like watching horror movies. But something about this whole situation makes my skin crawl. \n\nJust let me explain why I'm so sure. Once I've done that, hopefully one of you will believe me, and you'll be able to tell me what to do. \n\nThe morning after \"Rick\" came home, I made him a cup of tea. When I handed it to him, he gave me the brightest smile. Then he took a sugar cube from the dish on the table and dropped it into the cup. Our house was in chaos with his return, and I was still in shock, so I didn't think much of it at the time, but its been replaying in my mind ever since. I know it doesn't sound very significant, but my husband never put sugar in his tea. He was always adamant that it ruined the taste, and he'd get so frustrated if I ever put sugar in his cup by accident. And yet, this man had sugar. \n\nThen it was the golf. A few days ago, when he was out visiting his mom, I recorded a golf tournament that was showing on the TV. It was one of Rick's favourite golfers that was competing, and he never missed it. Once, he even skipped out on an anniversary dinner just to watch a championship. Only, when he came home from his parents' and I told him what I'd done, he just seemed... unbothered? Like, he said thanks and everything, and then he asked if I wanted to get dinner. He didn't even watch it, and that\u2019s just so out of character for him. \n\nThen one night I woke up around 2 a.m. to see Rick's face inches from mine just... looking at me with these blank eyes. I kinda gave this nervous laugh and asked \"Baby, what are you doing?\" And he didn't answer. For like a solid thirty seconds. He just stared, almost like he was looking right through me. Then he suddenly smiled and said, \"Sorry, honey. Sometimes I just can\u2019t believe this is real\". Then he just rolled over and went to sleep. I didn\u2019t get much sleep after that, myself.\n\nYesterday, about a week after he came home, the neighbourhood threw a street party to celebrate his return. Everyone from our street and the streets on either side turned up to see him and tell him how happy they are that he's alright. When he wasn't standing with his arm around my waist, he was milling around chatting amicably to each and every one of our neighbours, even the little kids. Jackson, our next-door neighbour Sally's toddler, wanted to play peek-a-boo, and Rick happily played along with a smile on his face. Now, my husband never did that. Rick always said he didn't like kids - that's why we never had any - and so he never wanted to play with any of the neighbourhood children. Especially not Jackson: Rick all but avoided him. Before he disappeared, I had started to suspect it was so I wouldn't see them together and notice the subtle but unmistakable similarities. \n\nThe final nail in the coffin, proverbially speaking, was Sally. Just this morning, she came knocking on our door. Her excuse was the tray of brownies she carried, but I think she just wanted to push her way into our morning so that she could see for herself what the situation was. After she left, I called her a nosy busybody. Rick laughed, kissed my head, and agreed with me. That was when I knew for sure that it couldn't really be him. Rick always used to get so mad whenever I insulted Sally, like I didn't have any right to hate her even though she'd been fucking my husband for years. But today there was none of that. He didn\u2019t even try to defend her. \n\nI know what you must be thinking. If he was in an accident or something, he might\u2019ve had some kind of traumatic brain injury that caused him to forget some things about his life, maybe even change his personality. And that's a valid, reasonable explanation. I have no doubt it's what the police would tell me if I reported all this. \n\nBut you know why I'm dead certain that man isn't my husband? He doesn't have a scar. If he was really Rick, he'd have a scar on the side of his forehead shaped like the golf club I hit him with. But there's nothing. Not a mark. Honestly, I'm this close to going out tonight and digging up my petunias just to make sure he's still under there. \n\nI don't know what I'm sharing a bed with, but I know it's not my husband. So what the hell am I going to do?\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/u9cq7q/my_missing_husband_came_home_but_i_know_it_isnt/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)",

When we were told I was dying, I woke up every night with my husband staring at me! I would laugh too and ask him what he was doing, he would shake his head about a minute later, he said he was afraid if he fell asleep that he\u2019d wake up and I wouldn\u2019t be there! So even when We were told I wouldn\u2019t live past Christmas and I\u2019m still here and fighting, I still wake up to find him staring at me like he\u2019s looking into my soul! Loosing someone and the \u201cnot knowing\u201d, can change everything about the both of you! After I passed Christmas and I\u2019m \u201cliving on borrowed time\u201d I find myself doing it to him too! But it\u2019s different because he\u2019ll have to wake up every day \u201cnot knowing\u201d and I\u2019ll just be gone!",

If Rick didn't know he had a twin, or didn't tell his wife/family/friends about a twin, I doubt the twin could just show up and take over Rick's life this way, not knowing the subtle intricacies of Rick's daily life and the inside jokes shared with those close to him. His idiosyncrasies would most likely be quite different from those of the real Rick. Overall such a great story, with an unexpected twist which slightly pains me to admit to, because normally I can see a twist a mile away. Wonderful job.",

The crucial part of this is how you feel: do you feel safe? At ease? Your husband goes missing for 6 months and returns without a scratch on him, in fact some scratches missing. Doesn\u2019t that seem strange? This woman would 100% know if he\u2019s the real deal or not. Idk lady, keep monitoring his behaviour. You should consider taking him to a hypnotherapist, I know that sounds a little alternative but they can help with repressed or forgotten memories.",

He left days after you \"killed\" him, bided his time, hatched a revenge plot and now is back. He's decided to pretend to be the perfect husband, it's all a setup to lull you into a false sense of security. When he was staring at you, he was studying you, trying to figure out the best way to get his revenge. I've heard of things like this happening before. Someone tries to kill an immortal being, it doesn't go well, and when they get revenge, well, it's not pretty. Your best bet for safety is to run, don't tell him where you're going, leave when he's at work or something, pack the essentials.",

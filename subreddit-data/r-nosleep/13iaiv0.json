But when I stop and turn he shouts, \u201cKeep running, Meg.\u201d And then he howls in pain as he\u2019s drawn into the sky.\n\n  \nJordy had been working at our video store for over two years before he started using the job as a way to deal drugs. It was a pretty simple transaction. If you came in and asked him for \u201ca double feature and a pizza extra cheese\u201d he\u2019d put a quarter of weed into a hollowed-out VHS tape and give it to you. You\u2019d pay him by taping a folded-up twenty dollar bill to your video store membership card, which he\u2019d peel off and pocket without any of us seeing him do it. \n\nThe deal only worked when Jordy was manning the front desk. Which was often enough. Because really, Video Dreams was a family-run operation. My father treated Jordy like a son until the day he fired him. \n\nIt was twelve years before I saw Jordy again. A few days after my father's funeral, he showed up at the social services office in Bordentown where I was working. He asked me to have lunch with him and we walked to the diner down the block.  \n\n\n\u201cYou were always like a sister to me, Meg. I feel like those early years at the video store with your mom and dad were the closest to a real family life that I ever got.\u201d  \n\n\nI nodded but didn\u2019t comment. Being a good social worker is about listening and not stepping in to offer a response until the emotional moment is right. I could tell Jordy needed to get something off his chest. And he was fidgety. I assumed he was still using, and dealing with withdrawal.  \n\u201cI just wish I hadn\u2019t fucked it up. It was the worst decision of my life. I wonder where I\u2019d be now if I hadn\u2019t been such an idiot.\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cMy folks always loved having you around. You and Dad loved all the same movies.\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cYeah, we liked the weird stuff. Movies where the heroes were just as messed up as the villains.\u201d  \n\n\nJordy\u2019s father used to beat him with a belt. Neck down, so there were no noticeable marks. I had no idea that this was going on while Jordy was working for us. When I heard about it years later, after Jordy\u2019s dad had fallen to his death at a construction job, I confronted my father about the beatings and asked him if he knew. He swore he\u2019d had no idea. It was Jordy\u2019s grandma who told everyone her son was a child beater. By then, Jordy was mixed up with some gangsters in Philly and not around town much.  \n\n\n\u201cI would have never fired him if I knew his dad was hurting him like that,\u201d my father said when we talked about it. And then he cried.  \n\n\n\u201cDad didn\u2019t understand what you were going through. None of us did. He would have made different choices if he had,\u201d I told Jordy.  \nHe shifted in his seat at the diner and gave a weak smile. \n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI guess we don\u2019t always know what kind of movie we\u2019re watching from what happens in the beginning.\u201d  \n\n\nHe wanted to know if I still had all the old video tapes. I did. Dad had rented a storage unit in New Hanover, more out in the country, and Mom and I planned to keep the tapes there until we figured out what to do with them. Jordy asked if we could go have a look. \n\n\u201cI just want to be surrounded by them again. Read some of the boxes.\u201d  \n\n\nIt made sense to me. He wanted to relive his last moment of innocence. Before things broke for him. I got this a lot in my line of work. People yearning to reconnect with a simple beauty that\u2019s been lost, even if it\u2019s just a taste. The distraught and mentally ill are like junkies for nostalgia, for the time before it went bad.  \n\n\nWe met at the storage facility the following weekend. I think Jordy was trying to avoid being high around me so he was very jittery. He was shaking more than he had been at the diner. He had a grouchy disposition. \n\nWhen I said, \u201cgood morning,\u201d he scoffed at me and said, \u201cEasy to say when you\u2019ve got all the answers.\u201d \n\nI stared at him for a moment and he apologized. But I got the sense that he was only taking it back because he didn\u2019t want me to leave without letting him in to see the tapes.  \n\n\nI\u2019d never been in the storage unit. Dad had done a remarkable job of stacking the tapes in sections, by genre. The most recent tapes sat on top of the piles and descended by year. So it was incredibly easy to browse. Jordy wasted no time, moving for the horror pile and looking up and down the stacks while I perused our small documentary collection. \n\nIt only took him two minutes to find what he was looking for. I looked up and saw Jordy standing over me, holding a weathered copy of *Def-Con 4*. The cover featured a skeleton in an astronaut suit, half-buried on a sandy planet with a space station looming overhead. I\u2019d never seen it.  \n\n\n\u201cDo you mind if I keep this one? It\u2019s an old favorite, and I can\u2019t find it anywhere.\u201d \n\nThere was an intensity to his request and his right hand was clenched in a white-knuckle fist at his side.  \n\n\n\u201cIt would mean so much to me,\u201d he said.  \n\n\nI nodded. \u201cSure, Jordy. Of course.\u201d  \n\n\nHe turned quickly and walked out of the storage unit. That was all he was really looking for. I locked up. When I got back to the parking lot Jordy was in his car, disassembling the tape. I pretended to fish for my keys in my purse while I covertly watched him open it up and pull out a sandwich bag of white powder.  \n\n\nI climbed into my car and started it up. Jordy knocked on my window. \n\n\u201cThanks for bringing me by,\u201d he said. \u201cThat meant a lot to me. We\u2019ll see how the movie plays. I have a feeling it\u2019ll hold up just fine.\u201d  \n\u201cYou take care,\u201d I said and I drove away.\n\n  \nThat was eighteen years ago. After that, he just sort of disappeared. My guess was that he probably got himself into trouble, either by using or mixing up with the wrong people. Maybe he was dead. Three years after our storage unit experience, he was a no-show at his grandmother\u2019s funeral and everyone in his family was quiet when his name came up except for an uncle who I overheard say, \u201cThat boy is swimming with the fish.\u201d Which meant that Jordy had been murdered by the mafia or gangsters. Didn\u2019t surprise me. I had seen more than a few young men like Jordy meet a similar fate.  \n\n\nI thought about him from time to time. Especially when Mom and I cleared out all of the VHS tapes. We donated them to the college, after we heard they were opening a new screening center that was VHS-friendly.  \n\n\nIt was a Tuesday in early June the next time I saw him. I had just gotten back from visiting with a family who had been dealing with an abusive stepdad situation, when Jordy approached me as I was unlocking my office door.  \n\n\n\u201cMeg Manchette. The sign on the door makes you look more like a private investigator than a social worker.\u201d  \nIn some ways, being a social worker wasn\u2019t so different from being a private investigator. And truth be told, I\u2019d taken a bunch of jobs that blurred the line between social service and investigative work since I opened my own practice.\n\n  \n\u201cHow\u2019s that for a rewind. How you doing, Jordy? Didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see you again.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cYou thought I was dead,\u201d he said and I didn\u2019t respond. \u201cCan we talk inside?\u201d\n\n  \nI let him into the office. We sat in the lobby and I took the armchair in the corner, the one with a Smith &amp; Wesson taped underneath it. I deal with a lot of ugly situations and bad people in my work. This dude stole from me last time. And he was a longtime addict. I couldn\u2019t trust him. Not anymore.  \nThat said, Jordy was looking better. Gaunt and aged, but with good color in his face. He had a brown leather jacket on and dark slacks with black tennis shoes. Which meant he was either a caterer or a chauffeur. \u201cYou\u2019re taking care of yourself,\u201d I told him.\n\n  \n\u201cTrying. I bottomed out hard, not long after we saw each other last. Spent five years in a Mexican prison.\u201d I let out a whistle. Jordy smiled. \u201cIf a Mexican prison doesn\u2019t teach you not to take your shit for granted, then nothing will. Worked on some oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico for a few years. Found God and then lost him again. Got married and divorced, which was tied to the God stuff. Ended up back in Philly about six years ago. Working as a driver for some businessmen.\u201d\n\n  \nI knew the kinds of businessmen that hired guys like Jordy as their drivers. They were the types of men who expected bullets from their associates and invested in human shields.  \n\n\n\u201cQuite the run,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to find that you\u2019re alive.\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cI almost died ten times down in Mexico. Sometimes, I think I did die down there.\u201d He looked at his hands. I got up and made us two cups of coffee from my machine. When I came back to the lobby, Jordy was standing.  \n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to waste your time. I\u2019ve done a lot of dumb things to you and your family. I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d  \n\n\nIt was okay, I told him. Shit happens.  \n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who I can trust any more,\u201d he went on. \u201cMost of my family is dead and the ones who are still alive, I think they\u2019re watching them. Waiting for me to show up. You were always real nice to me. Like family.\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cWhat kind of trouble are you in?\u201d I asked.  \n\u201cThe worst kind. They\u2019re going to kill me. The men I work for. To cover up for what they\u2019ve done. Some crooked cops are in the mix. If I went to the cops, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d find the right one.\u201d  \n\n\nI knew plenty of good cops. Most of them were good. But the bad ones had their spies. If the cops were after him, it could be because he was mixed up with corrupt cops or it could be because he was a lowlife criminal that deserved apprehending.  \n\n\nI asked him again. \u201cWhat kind of trouble are you in?\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cThey call me Sleepy Head. You heard of me?\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cHave I heard of Sleepy Head?\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cYeah. I run all up and down the state, from Philly through Trenton and Newark, up to the Big Apple.\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of Sleepy Head,\u201d I said.  \n\n\n\u201cIt started out, I was just driving for this rich dude. He had someone he was having issues with, an old accountant of his. So he had me drive this guy out to the Pine Barrens at dusk. Told me to wear a gas mask and just drop the accountant off and leave him in the middle of the forest there. The guy pleaded with me, said he\u2019d pay me to let him walk. When I left him outside in the Barrens, he got real slow, sleepy, like he was in a daze. Just kind of started wandering around. I drove away. And the accountant was never heard of again. I told a couple of other guys about that and it turns out they had some people who they wanted to have disappear. So I did it again, and again. Just dropped people off at dusk in the Pine Barrens while I was wearing a breathing mask. As soon as they\u2019d get out of the car, they\u2019d start wandering around like they were in a dream. I\u2019d drive off and leave them there. And that\u2019s the last that anyone would ever see of them.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of like murder, Jordy.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cKind of. But it isn\u2019t. I was just leaving people in the woods. And most of the time, I was working for cops who wanted to have criminals disappear. Bad guys who got off on charges. Then I got in so deep that I couldn\u2019t stop. They wouldn\u2019t let me stop.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cHow many of these rides have you done?\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cLittle more than thirty. A few people got away. I don\u2019t know how. They stumbled out of the Barrens while they were in the daze, I guess.\u201d  \n That was a lot of people to have disappeared. \u201cThe ones who lived started talking about me,\u201d he went on. \u201cThey\u2019re calling me Sleepy Head. Now the cop dudes and bosses want to get rid of me, because they know I\u2019ll turn as soon as I\u2019m in custody.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cYou should turn yourself in. I\u2019ll go with you. You\u2019ll be safer on the inside.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cMeg, you know how much a prison guard makes in a year. You know how much a prison guard makes for a hit? They\u2019d have me killed the first night.\u201d\n\n  \nHe was probably right. But this sounded like murder to me. Any shred of kinship or sympathy I felt for Jordy was diminishing by the moment.\n\n  \n\u201cI promise you. I had no choice.\u201d He took out his phone and started going through his photos. \u201cThey took my daughter.\u201d He flashed some pictures of him with a young girl, probably twelve. She looked a lot like Jordy\u2019s grandmother. \n\n\u201cThey said they\u2019re going to put her in the Barrens tonight, if I don\u2019t turn myself over to them.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cWhat do you think happens to them at night in the Pine Barrens?\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cI don\u2019t think, I know. The Devil gets them.\u201d  \nEveryone in the area knows about the Jersey Devil. It\u2019s what your parents told you when they didn\u2019t want you sneaking out at night, because it\u2019s what their parents told them to keep them off the streets and out of the woods after dark. For the towns surrounding the Pine Barrens, it\u2019s our local version of the boogeyman. The legend charts all the way back to 1735, when Jane Leeds discovered she was pregnant with her thirteenth child. Out of frustration and perhaps fear of the number thirteen, Jane cursed the child in her womb. The baby was born a wild demon-beast, part goat, part bat, with a taste for blood. As soon as Jane had popped out the little creature, it snarled at momma, attacked those attending the birth, and flew up the chimney and into the Pine Barrens, where it\u2019s lived -- and hunted -- ever since. \n\nSome people claim that Jane was a witch and conjured the demon child on purpose. Labelling someone a witch was an easy way to blame a woman for anything.\n\n  \nThat\u2019s the story. No one past the age of ten actually bought into the Jersey Devil. It was a fun thing to talk about and gave a hike through the Pine Barrens a little extra energy, but a killer goat-bat wasn\u2019t the real reason why you wanted to stay out of that stretch of forest these days.\n\n  \nI\u2019d heard that gangsters used the Barrens for dumping bodies -- human remains have been discovered out there on multiple occasions. And hikers were always getting lost in the park. It\u2019s a big area, with little in the way of marked trails or discernible geographic features. It\u2019s just dense, flat woodland.  \nI wanted to tell Jordy to get the fuck out of my office. Whatever the pressures he was under, he was still responsible for leaving over thirty people in the woods to die. That would make him a serial killer. When he was telling me about the moniker he\u2019d been given -- Sleepy Head -- I sensed a bit of pride in his voice. Like he was highlighting it to say that he\u2019d finally amounted to something. Something that people knew about, and would remember. The kind of name that one of his beloved VHS movies from the 80s would carry.\n\n  \nBut there was a young girl involved.\n\n  \n\u201cSleepy Head,\u201d I said dubiously.\n\n  \nHe grew grave, showing no sign of pride or pleasure in his work. \u201cThere\u2019s this part of the forest. It\u2019s a clearing surrounded by a tight ring of trees. That\u2019s where I leave them. At sundown. It\u2019s so dark you can\u2019t tell what end is up when you\u2019re in there.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cAnd you\u2019ve never stuck around to see what happens?\u201d\n\n  \nHe shook his head. \u201cNo. Some people have gotten free. I think they just got lucky. Stumbled out in the right direction before the Devil could get them.\u201d \n\nHe leaned forward with his hands crossed in his lap. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to go there tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cIn exchange for my little girl. And if I don\u2019t show up, they\u2019re going to put my daughter in the woods. I need your help to make sure she gets out okay.\u201d  \nI realized that he didn\u2019t want me to save him. He had accepted death.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had this coming to me for a long time,\u201d he said, confirming my guess. \u201cI should have run away as soon as I knew what was happening to the people I left.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cWhat happened to them?\u201d I asked again.\n\n  \n\u201cI went poking around after the fifth drop-off out there and found the person\u2019s body.\u201d\n\n  \nThe deceased had been a serial criminal, a man who had killed a bunch of bodega owners in robberies, but the cops couldn\u2019t lock him up without prints or a weapon. Jordy found him a half mile from the circle, by a small pond. He was on his knees and hunched over. Something had eaten through his face and straight into his head. Through the facial bones. His brain was gone. His head was just an empty cave, like a gored-out pumpkin.\n\n  \nJordy tried to quit after that, but the bad men he worked for threatened to go after his family. So he kept cool. For a while.\n\n  \n\u201cWhat\u2019s your daughter\u2019s name?\u201d I asked.\n\n  \n\u201cEleonore.\u201d  \n\u201cYou named her after your grandma.\u201d \n\nHe nodded and his eyes started to tear up.\n\n  \nI told him that I would escort his daughter to safety. But that if it meant me having to go out to the Pine Barrens, I was going to bring a friend. A very capable friend.\n\n  \nJordy gave me the coordinates and a map pin for where I should wait. \n\n\u201cJust be there by eight thirty. They\u2019re going to leave me right at sundown. Which is about nine. I\u2019ll tell Eleonore where to find you before they put me in the circle.\u201d \n\nHe hugged me and thanked me and said, \u201cI know I was an asshole to you. But back in the day, I was a good kid.\u201d \n\nI knew he was. \n\n\u201cThank you for helping my daughter.\u201d\n\n  \nI watched him drive off and then I called my very capable friend, Brandon Calley.\n\n  \nI don\u2019t date clients. Brandon was the only exception. He\u2019s an ex-military, ex-cop with two ex- wives. He was suffering from really bad, compounded PTSD when I met him at an AA meeting. To be fair, he asked me on a date before I told him he needed my help. After three months of talking and Brandon working with a therapist friend of mine, I agreed to meet him for dinner. We dated for a few weeks before realizing that our lifestyles didn\u2019t match well. We didn\u2019t quite click. I loved the guy, I just didn\u2019t love the guy. He was cool with being friends.\n\n  \nBrandon helped me buy the gun under the armchair and set up the security system in my office. He was doing well these days, managing a hardware store and training fighters in jiu-jitsu. He  \n   \nlived in an old warehouse out in an industrial part of Philadelphia. We didn\u2019t cross paths, but we were there for each other when needed.\n\n  \nHe cancelled his evening class and drove out to meet me at my house. It was a muggy evening and the cicadas were out in force, already calling in the night when we left for the park at just past seven.  \n\u201cThis is some batshit crazy story,\u201d he said as he drove. We had taken his truck with its off-road capabilities and its arsenal in the compartment beneath the bed.\n\n  \n\u201cBat-goat-shit crazy story,\u201d I replied. \u201cJordy has done a lot of drugs in his life, but he didn\u2019t seem to be making it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re good at telling when people are lying,\u201d Brandon said.\n\n  \nI am. \n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean he isn't full of shit. He just believes in what he\u2019s saying.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Brandon asked me.\n\n  \n\u201cI think there\u2019s a little girl caught up in a bad mess. And we\u2019re going to help her.\u201d  \nThe details change, but you\u2019d be surprised by how similar cases of child endangerment are. It really just boils down to broken, toxic people getting themselves in trouble and pulling their kids along for the ride. Jordy was good enough to find me. That was something.\n\n  \nWe pulled onto a dirt road into the Pine Barrens, the one that Jordy had pointed out to me on the map. It was less than two miles to the marker. Brandon parked behind a section of brush and then I helped him draw a brown tarp over his truck. It wasn\u2019t even eight yet. We were early.\n\n  \n\u201cTake a look around?\u201d I asked him. \n\nBrandon grabbed his backpack and we went for a hike. The trees were pretty evenly spaced in this part of the forest. I followed the map on my phone in the direction of the circle. We stopped at a fallen tree about a hundred yards out from the truck and Brandon gathered a bunch of sticks. He laid them at an angle over the tree, creating a bit of a shelter. \n\n\u201cIn case someone follows the girl,\u201d he said.\n\n  \nWhen we approached the circle it didn\u2019t look like a circle at first. The trees seemed to squeeze tighter, forming a wall. It wasn\u2019t until we were a few feet back that we could see the circular clearing in the middle of the tree perimeter. Brandon took a step to move into the clearing but I put my hand on his chest.\n\n  \n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d he asked me.\n\n  \n\u201cLet\u2019s just wait and see.\u201d  \nHe laughed but found a tree a few feet behind the perimeter. He climbed up and mounted a game camera there. When we got back to his truck he handed me the camera\u2019s remote monitor and showed me how to switch into night vision. The clearing was a perfect circle. The trees must have been planted with purpose, hundreds of years ago. There was a section on the far side where the trees were spaced a bit further apart, creating a bit of an opening into the area. Brandon assembled a sniper rifle and drew two handguns out from beneath the truck\u2019s bed. He handed me one of the pistols.\n\n  \nAt 8:37 I spotted a heavy-set man in the circle\u2019s entrance. He stood there, looking side to side, without moving in. A few minutes later, he was joined by a short man with slicked-back hair. They were total mafia types. Embarrassingly so. Lots of gold chains and rings. Popped collars with the top few buttons of their shirts undone.\n\n  \n\u201cI\u2019m going to see how many there are.\u201d \n\nBrandon slinked away with the sniper rifle in hand.  \n\n\nThe goons moved from the circle area. The sun was dipping, giving way to the cries of night birds. Brandon came back five minutes later and whispered that there were two SUVs filled with mafia heavies, but no sign of Jordy or his daughter. Then, at five of nine, with the sun almost down, the goons pushed Jordy and Eleonore into the circle.  \nThey wobbled a bit. Turned in circles, looking to the treetops. And then Jordy dropped down, taking Eleonore in his arms. He nodded to the other side of the circle, in my direction. The girl seemed to plead with him and put up a fight, but Jordy pushed her through the far side of the tree wall and I could see her pass just beneath the camera we had mounted.\n\n  \n\u201cI\u2019ll go get her.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cRoger that, Captain.\u201d Brandon gave me a wink and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be watching,\u201d as he raised the rifle\u2019s night scope to his eye.\n\n  \nThe light was fading fast. She hadn\u2019t gotten far from the circle when I met her. She was trembling. \n\nI said, \u201cEleonore, I\u2019m your father\u2019s friend, Meg.\u201d She had a dazed look about her. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me, okay?\u201d \n\nShe nodded. I took her hand and led her back in the direction I had come. I heard footsteps nearby and voices. We ducked into the fallen-tree structure that Brandon had put together and waited. Not a minute later, some of the mafia boys held up near us. I put my finger to my lips, gesturing for Eleonore to stay quiet.\n\n  \n\u201cHe wants us to find her,\u201d one guy said and the other replied, \u201cHe wants us to find her to make sure she stays in the woods. She probably stumbled off in the other direction.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cWhat if she went to the road?\u201d  \n\u201cShe couldn\u2019t have made it there that fast.\u201d \n\nOne of them lit a cigarette. They were close enough that I could smell the smoke. Brandon was watching. If they made the mistake of finding us now, he\u2019d open their heads up like cans of soup.\n\n  \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be here. Sun\u2019s almost down,\u201d the one guy said, taking nervous drags on his cigarette.\n\n \u201cIf he asks, the girl wandered off into the woods and we lost her when it got dark. Yeah?\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cYeah,\u201d his partner responded, and they shuffled their meaty frames back to their SUVs with their gold chains and heads intact.\n\n  \nWhen we emerged from the shelter, the faintest sliver of light lingered through the trees.\n\n  \n\u201cThank you, Ms. Manchette,\u201d Eleonore said. \u201cCan we go get my dad now?\u201d\n\n  \nI told her that the bad guys who took her might still be watching where they left her dad and that if we went back now, they\u2019d get both of us.\n\n  \n\u201cWe can\u2019t leave him in there,\u201d she said.\n\n  \n\u201cWe\u2019ll get him out in a little bit. We just need to make sure the coast is clear first.\u201d  \nI moved a few steps ahead of Eleonore, leading her to Brandon and the truck, when she broke away from me and ran back towards the circle. Her footsteps made a lot of noise. I followed her.\n\n  \nI found her in the circle, crouched over Jordy. Her father had taken his shirt off and covered himself in dirt. He wasn\u2019t moving.\n\n  \nI moved into the circle to meet them and as soon as I broke the tree perimeter, my head started to swim. I could feel sweat rise up all over my body. It felt a bit like food poisoning. I was reeling. Next thing I knew, Eleonore was standing over me. I must have fallen to the ground. She had her t-shirt pulled up over her nose and mouth, and gestured for me to do the same. I was blinking in and out of consciousness and really just felt like I needed to go to sleep. She pulled my shirt up over my face. After a few breaths, my head calmed down. I stood up, stumbled a bit, and then leaned on Eleonore.\n\n  \n\u201cCan you help me drag him?\u201d she asked. \n\nI didn\u2019t think I could but I nodded all the same. She supported me as we moved over to Jordy. He was shaking on the ground and covered in dirt. His eyes fluttered. Eleonore let go of me and grabbed her dad\u2019s left leg. That\u2019s when we heard some rustling in the treetops. I gave a quick look over my shoulder and saw him there. A man in shadows, hunched atop a pine tree at the far end of the circle. He wasn\u2019t moving. Just sitting there, watching us.  \nA surge of adrenaline shot through me and I shouted, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d \n\nWe each took a leg and dragged Jordy to the edge of the circle. When we were a few feet away from the treeline, the man dropped down to the ground. He couldn\u2019t have been more than fifty feet away from us. I stayed focused on dragging Jordy out of the circle. \n\nIf you look at the Devil, can you look away again? I was certain I\u2019d be overcome by the circle\u2019s power if I stopped doing what I was doing. I needed to get off of this patch of land.\n\n  \nWe made it through the trees and paused to catch our breath. I looked back. The Devil was flying inside of the circle, round and round along the inner edge at such speed that the trees shook as he passed.\n\n  \n\u201cWe need to keep moving,\u201d Eleonore said. \n\nWe dragged Jordy another fifteen feet and then he came to. He coughed as he sat up and looked behind to where the Devil was still flying in the circle.\n\n  \n\u201cThere he is,\u201d Jordy said. \n\nHe had that twinkle in his eye again. The same one he had when he fished the VHS of *Def-Con 4* out of my father\u2019s storage unit. \n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t kill me. Not after everything I\u2019ve done for him.\u201d\n\n  \nJordy got up. He looked like he was about to walk back to the circle. Eleonore grabbed his hand and said, \u201cI\u2019m tired of your shit, Dad. Let\u2019s go!\u201d  \nWe hadn\u2019t gotten much further on the trail when the Devil landed in front of us. He was about seven feet tall, with long, skinny limbs that bent at animal-like angles and ended in curved hooves. His pointed tail whipped and flexed behind him. His head was that of a man. Except for his long, sloped mouth that looked kind of like a goat's. He smiled and flashed jagged, decayed teeth. Enormous bat wings spread behind him. He had human eyes, which studied us with thoughtful interest.\n\n  \n\u201cHi, baby,\u201d Jordy said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me this time. These are my friends. I\u2019ll bring you something to eat real soon.\u201d\n\n  \nJordy reached out and placed his hand on the Devil\u2019s chest. The creature lunged in and bit Jordy on the shoulder, tearing off a bit of flesh. Jordy screamed and Eleonore and I ran away. \n\nHe shouted behind us, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. That\u2019s just how he plays is all.\u201d\n\n  \nThe Devil flew up behind us and took Eleonore in his arms. He drew the girl up to a branch that was at least fifteen feet high. He sat there, holding her, watching me as I screamed and shouted at him to bring the girl back. He clenched Eleonore to his chest.\n\n  \n\u201cLet her go, baby!\u201d Jordy shouted. \n\nBut the Devil held the girl out and opened his fanged mouth wide.  \nThat\u2019s when his head exploded. Brandon had connected with a clean shot, right through the middle of the Devil\u2019s head. The creature fell to the ground with Eleonore in his arms. When I pulled her free she was grunting, fast and repeatedly -- she was in the throes of shock.\n\n  \nJordy drew a hunting knife out from his boot and stood over the dead beast.\n\n  \n\u201cTake my daughter out of here,\u201d he said.\n\n  \n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cI\u2019m going to clean him like a deer. And then I\u2019ll eat him.\u201d\n\n  \nAt first I thought I heard him wrong. And then I was overcome by a wave of horror and panicked realization. I pulled Eleonore away. Jordy got right to it, sawing into the Devil\u2019s chest cavity with his serrated knife. \n\nI didn\u2019t look back. When I got to the truck, Brandon had already started it. He sat behind the wheel, staring through the windshield. He didn\u2019t turn to me. I could tell it was all coming back on him in that moment -- the deaths in aggregate, his accumulated kills -- as he sat with a cold terror about his face. Like a man who believed he was marked. Killing the beast wasn\u2019t as easy as pulling the trigger. There was a residue. And worse, a meditation on all of the evil and death wrought between them.  \nEleonore slept in the truck\u2019s cabin on the drive back while Brandon and I rode in silence. \n\nWhen he dropped us off at my house he said, \u201cWhy did he cut it up?\u201d\n\n  \nI wasn\u2019t sure, but I said, \u201cTo get rid of it forever, maybe.\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t tell Brandon that Jordy was planning to eat the Devil\u2019s flesh as well. I never told anyone about that part.\n\n  \nThe girl was in bad shape the next day. She was distraught over what happened to her dad. I told her that he was fine and still alive. That he had some injuries and needed to get fixed up in the hospital, but that we\u2019d hopefully see him soon. I didn\u2019t know what else to say. I took off the next day and stayed at home with her. I got Chinese food delivered for dinner that night. \n\nAs we feasted on dumplings Eleonore said to me, \u201cHe\u2019s not in the hospital, is he?\u201d\n\n  \nI apologized. Told her that I lied because I didn\u2019t want her to be freaked out.\n\n  \n\u201cBut he\u2019s still alive?\u201d\n\n  \nI nodded. I was pretty sure that he was alive. And out in the Pine Barrens. She left it at that and we finished eating. \n\nBefore bed she said, \u201cHe goes missing all the time. Leaves for a day or so. I get nervous when he\u2019s gone. But he comes back for me. He always does.\u201d\n\n  \nThat night she woke up screaming. I ran into her room and she was frantic. Said she had a nightmare. \n\n\u201cMy dad was flying around the city like a dragon.\u201d  \nI looked out the window. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see him out there,\u201d I told her. \n\nI made up a bed for her on the floor in my room, but I don\u2019t think she went back to sleep after that. When I woke up at dawn, she was sitting in the window of my room staring out.\n\n  \nI found Jordy\u2019s aunt, Beverly, who still lived in the same apartment building where he grew up. I informed her that Jordy had gone out of town and that I was pretty sure he was in some trouble. Could she watch Eleonore for a little while? She said she hadn\u2019t heard from Jordy in twenty years and didn\u2019t even know that Jordy had a daughter. But she was happy to watch the girl.\n\n  \nBefore I left Eleonore with her great aunt, we talked about keeping everything that happened in the Pine Barrens our secret. I\u2019d check in with her every few days.\n\n  \n\u201cI\u2019m going to look for your father,\u201d I told her, and she made me promise that I would find him.",

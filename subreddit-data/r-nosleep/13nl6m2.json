    "postText": "I\u2019m a person. \n\nWell, of course I am.\n\nA silly thing to say, isn\u2019t it?\n\nI\u2019m the one writing this and I\u2019ll be the one to post it.\n\nRest assured that the first sentence is more of a reminder for myself than for you, dear reader.\n\nYou see, I\u2019m a person.\n\nI\u2019ve been born, I\u2019ve been raised, I\u2019ve struggled with homework, gotten annoyed when someone didn\u2019t order fast enough in line, etc.\n\nNormal things, by all means.\n\nBut despite all of this, I sometimes feel as though it\u2019s not these mundane, or even happy moments, that define me as a person, but just the bad.\n\nMoments where I feel as though I am only defined by the men I\u2019ve come across in my life.\n\nMen who I gave my trust to, but who always shattered it in the end.\n\nI once read about someone named Dean Allen Cole.\n\nA prolific serial killer he was, and one who\u2019d torture his victims by first inserting a glass rod into their urethra and then shattering said glass rod while it was still inside them.\n\nI find that to be a pretty good analogy for what these men have done to me. I allowed each of them to insert a glass rod in me, trusting them not to break it, but they all did.\n\nThey all broke that rod, shattering it into fine grains of sand.\n\nBut the way each of them did this differed wildly.\n\nIt made it that much harder for me to see the signs.\n\nI am a person.\n\nI\u2019ve paid my taxes.\n\nI\u2019ve been on disaster dates.\n\nI\u2019ve gone to the movies and so on and so forth.\n\nBut only until recently did I start to be supported by these memories instead of the three glass rods I\u2019ve had to heal from.\n\nThis will be a story about three men.\n\nEach of whom I allowed to place a glass rod in me.\n\nAnd each of whom shattered it without a second thought.\n\n\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s start with my father.\n\nOf course.\n\nDoesn\u2019t it always start with the father?\n\nThe first man you meet in your life.\n\nAround ten minutes have passed since I wrote the previous sentence.\n\nI just had to take a moment and look outside my window.\n\nIt\u2019s morning now.\n\nI couldn\u2019t sleep, and I thought to hell with it.\n\nI\u2019ll just write this story.\n\nThat\u2019s probably why the first part sounds so disjointed. I\u2019m not going to change it, but I hope that you can look past it, for the sake of this story.\n\nAnyhow, I\u2019m now wondering where I should start.\n\nJust writing what comes to mind.\n\nMy dad never hit me, if you\u2019re wondering.\n\nThat\u2019s just too easy.\n\nIt\u2019s always about the hitters and the beaters.\n\nThe rapists even.\n\nThose who leave marks that can\u2019t be washed away.\n\nThose that can be documented and understood by those who have not personally gone through it.\n\nHardly anyone ever talks about the unseen.\n\nThe hidden.\n\nWhat can be washed, covered, and lost.\n\nMy dad did give me pancakes, and anything I asked for, and I always gave him hugs.\n\nBut sometimes he\u2019d want an extra tight hug or a sloppy and long kiss on the cheek, and these were the moments where I would become uncomfortable and push him away.\n\nI never knew he\u2019d put the glass rod in until these moments, when he\u2019d push it further or twist it.\n\nHe\u2019d do so by becoming grumpy and distant, giving me the cold shoulder or acting offended.\n\nAnd then things would go back to normal, only for this to happen again after a while.\n\nAfter how long?\n\nIt depended.\n\nBut I would be reminded of the rod\u2019s existence more and more often the older I got, to the point where I just couldn\u2019t forget about it before the next time.\n\nI became consumed by it.\n\nFearful of when it would move again.\n\nFearful of when it would shatter.\n\nI became a bit of a wreck, and I\u2019m still wondering if that\u2019s putting it mildly.\n\nI was afraid to rebel, to do the things that my father didn\u2019t like.\n\nI didn\u2019t have my mother to comfort me.\n\nMy parents had been divorced ever since I could remember, and maybe that\u2019s why I let things go on for as long as I did.\n\nI blamed the divorce on his overly attached behavior.\n\nBut I feel like whether or not that\u2019s the reason behind his actions is irrelevant.\n\nBy the time I was in high school, the glass rod was all I thought about.\n\nI say \u201cglass rod\u201d now, but I didn\u2019t think of it like that back then.\n\nI had yet to read about Dean Allen Cole.\n\nBack then it was more like a balloon.\n\nA metaphor that perfectly represented my innocence.\n\nHis kisses on my cheek felt like nasty and dirty stains, and his hugs made me feel like I was wading through sewage. I only thought about the rod breaking, the balloon bursting.\n\nAnd it did.\n\nIt finally did.\n\nI just wished it had done so sooner.\n\nI used to blame myself for not popping it, or getting the rod out, but I can\u2019t change the past.\n\nI can just remember it.\n\nAnd feel it too, no less.\n\nIt\u2019s been a day now since my last sentence. I thought I\u2019d continue it after my breakfast, but things got in the way.\n\nChores, people, excuses.\n\nBut now there\u2019s nothing I can hide behind.\n\nJust like back then.\n\nLet\u2019s just say that everything came to a boiling point on one very unassuming day.\n\nI remember that I woke up, the dread that my dreams always kept at bay washing over me like a fog. I went to school, and things got a bit better.\n\nThen I came home, and the fog fell on me once again.\n\nI tried to escape it, and so I went to my room to finish my homework.\n\nI could feel it building outside my door, and I indeed tried to ignore it, but just like with the glass rod, once you notice it, and you think about it, ignorance is as good as gone.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before it started to seep under my door.\n\nEach step my father took up the stairs made the fog reach closer and closer.\n\nThe knob turned, and in a flash, my surroundings became hazy as can be.\n\nI became lost in a dense fog.\n\nAs my father entered my room and sat on my bed, I stiffened like a statue.\n\nThe only clear thing about him was his voice.\n\n\u201cSteph,\u201d I remember him saying, \u201cis something wrong?\u201d\n\nComforting words, no?\n\nWell, I sure as hell didn\u2019t find them comforting.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to describe it back then, but now I really do get it.\n\nHis foot was right under my belly button.\n\nIt had always been there, threatening to push down and shatter the rod within me.\n\nAs he talked, and droned, and said the words you\u2019d expect from any concerned parent, my hands were gradually fading away.\n\nThe haziness was inching and crawling ever so closer to my head, each word that came out of his mouth making myself less and less visible to my eyes.\n\nAnd it\u2019s only when he mentioned my skimping on a date with a boy from my school that the fog reached my neck and I finally said what I wanted to say.\n\n\u201cDad,\u201d I said, the fog inches away from forever drowning my voice, \u201cI\u2026I want to live with mom.\u201d\n\nAnd just like that, the mist was gone, as though it had never been there in the first place.\n\nMy dad was silent.\n\nMy room was clear.\n\nAnd I realized that I had been crying.\n\nI turned to look at him, and was met only with a blank stare.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the moment when I understood that if I didn\u2019t do what I knew I had to do at that moment, I would forever be imprisoned by the walls of that house.\n\nWithout a word, I got up and made my way out.\n\nMy dad chased after me, asking me what was wrong, that he was willing to listen, and that we could work things out. When I grabbed the handle of our front door, he grabbed my wrist with just as much force. I looked in his eyes for the second time that night, and in them I saw concern and sadness and hurt.\n\nI contemplated what to do. He was still talking and pleading with me to stay, practically begging on his knees. My grip on the handle loosened, but that\u2019s when the other secret I\u2019d been keeping from him bubbled up to the surface.\n\n\u201cDad,\u201d I said with my gaze pointed straight at him, both of our eyes a hot mess of tears, \u201cI\u2026I-I like g-girls and I don\u2019t know what about that is so hard to understand.\u201d\n\nSilence followed this statement; one I shall never forget.\n\nI felt like I was on the verge of being crushed to paste, and when my father stood up, and I expected the worst, all that happened was his hand leaving my wrist.\n\nI looked up, and saw that his face no longer exuded any kind of sadness or hurt.\n\nJust disappointment.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, his voice as steady as a cliff,\u201d then maybe it\u2019s best you\u2026go \u2026\u201d\n\nAnd with those words, the boot that threatened me for the better part of my teenage life finally made good of its purpose.\n\nThe rod inside of me shattered.\n\nI was left speechless and in pain.\n\nThat was the price I had to pay for having strayed off from the script he had written for me.\n\nI was in shock from the sudden blow, and I left my house in shock, not even wearing any shoes, and I was in a state of shock until I reached my mother\u2019s doorstep.\n\nThe next day, boxes with all of my things appeared on her doorstep.\n\nI still haven\u2019t talked to my father since then.\n\nI was only able to remove most of the shards with help of my wonderful mother and my supportive friends.\n\nAnother day has passed since my last sentence.\n\nFitting, I should say.\n\nA page is being turned.\n\nThe coffee in my mug is as still as a mirror.\n\nI sip it freely, but there was once a time when I couldn\u2019t do so, for I couldn\u2019t bear to look at myself.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nWell, it used to remind me of the second time I found myself filled with broken glass.\n\n\u201cFool me once, shame on you\u201d goes the saying.\n\nThat was my mentality after the whole escapade with my father.\n\nIt allowed me to heal and see the good in life again.\n\nI finished high school, and then it was time to go to university.\n\nA fresh start far away from home.\n\nI was sad to leave my mother and my old friends (though I didn\u2019t mind leaving behind all the memories of the ridiculous dates I\u2019d had), but at the same time, I looked forward to the new start I would be given.\n\nI thought it would be beautiful, and indeed it was.\n\nI found myself surrounded by wonderful people who I never thought existed, people I wished I knew before, and whom I\u2019m grateful I\u2019ve met.\n\nWell, all besides one.\n\nFor the sake of his story, let\u2019s call him \u201cVic\u201d.\n\nMind you that his real name was much less threatening than that.\n\nAnyhow, I met \u201cVic\u201d in my second year. I still remember it like it was yesterday. A friend of mine had a birthday party, and I naturally went there to have a great time. I\u2019ll spare you of the finer details, but at one point I sat down in one of the chairs, tired from dancing, and I still remember the wonderful feeling I had.\n\nA feeling where everything was alright and everything would continue to be alright, but little did I know at the time that this couldn\u2019t be the farthest thing from the truth.\n\nMy fate was sealed the moment this skinny and stoic looking guy sat right next to me.\n\nAs he sat cross legged, something about his oozing and \u2013 in hindsight \u2013 juvenile confidence made me start up a conversation with him.\n\nHe introduced himself, and I introduced myself, and I made it clear I was a lesbian from the get go, and he seemed unbothered by this. The party ended, and we hadn\u2019t stopped talking, and when we finally left, we did so only after having exchanged numbers.\n\n\u201cYou seem like you\u2019d be a good friend,\u201d I remember him telling me, and how right he was, for I\u2019d let him slip his glass rod inside of me without a second thought.\n\nI just got back from work.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll continue the story.\n\nMe and \u201cVic\u201d became fast friends. Things went well at first. He was a bit of an introvert, and always needed that push from me to socialize, but he never complained.\n\nWe complimented each other in a way.\n\nTime flew by fast.\n\nMy mother, and even my father, had always told me that time flies fast, that it slips out of your hands like seemingly never-ending sand, but I didn\u2019t fully understand that until I found myself on that podium receiving my long-awaited degree.\n\nIt was there that I reflected back on my life, my college life, and remembered everything in detail.\n\nVic had dropped out, and I hadn\u2019t heard from him in a while.\n\nAnd I do admit that I had forgotten about him.\n\nBut as if by fate, which I do curse now, I received a call from him.\n\nI\u2019d heard bits and pieces about what had happened to Vic after he\u2019d dropped out \u2013 got involved with a gang, his mother died, failed abortion.\n\nA sad fairytale was what I\u2019d found myself in.\n\nVid didn\u2019t have anywhere to go anymore, and he needed me, his good friend, to give him shelter. And you know what?\n\nI did give him shelter.\n\nAfter I became employed and got my own apartment, I invited Vic and let him sleep on my couch.\n\nI felt bad for him, so I didn\u2019t even hesitate.\n\nAnd needless to say, things began to go downhill not too long after that.\n\nVic had changed since the last time I\u2019d seen him.\n\nHe\u2019d shed his introverted nature in favor of a more aggressively gregarious one. Almost all day he\u2019d be out of the house getting into God knows what. Only once the sun had set would he come back, always reeking of something new, before crashing on my couch and not waking up until the next day.\n\nHe didn\u2019t pay for anything or do any chores.\n\nA typical story, don\u2019t you think?\n\nWell, one day, I came home early and found that Vic had been hosting a party without my permission.\n\nI tried to chase everyone out, but they only laughed at me.\n\nThat was, of course, until I threatened to call the police from the doorway (ready to close and lock the door should they give chase).\n\nBut to my surprise, they all started to pool out almost immediately, and then it was just me, Vic, and the filthy mess everyone had made.\n\nI remember sighing, but Vic wasn\u2019t relaxed by any means. By all standards, he was absolutely livid.\n\nAs you might imagine, a very loud and very angry argument ensued.\n\nI didn\u2019t even realise how much I had been keeping in until it all came spilling out.\n\nWhatever he had to tell me was unceremoniously subdued by every ounce of frustration I was venting at that moment.\n\nAnd then I was done, and we both found ourselves standing in front of each other, in the living room, surrounded by a heavy silence.\n\nVic was speechless, and he looked at me with the eyes of a puppy, but I\u2019m quite sure that at that moment, my eyes resembled that of a predator.\n\nSoon, his pleading pupils dilated as his brow furrowed and his face took on the appearance of a small child who\u2019d been denied his favorite toy for far too long.\n\nI had forgotten about the glass rod I\u2019d let Vic put in me, but I remembered it pretty quickly when he pulled his gun on me.\n\nHis hand trembled furiously, but not out of fear, mind you, but out of a childish and uncontrollable rage.\n\nUp until now, the glass rod had never once moved, because despite everything, I still believed in Vic that he could change.\n\nBut at that moment, with the barrel of that pistol pointed straight at me, I knew that he was beyond hope.\n\nAnd I feared that I too was beyond hope at that moment.\n\nVic was saying something, but I wasn\u2019t focused on it in the least.\n\nThe barrel stared at me like his third eye, a pupil dilated to its utter limit so that it may take in everything.\n\nThe glass rod was cracking, hairline fractures holding back a cascade of broken shards that wanted nothing more or less than to rip my insides to shreds.\n\nMy mind boiled and bubbled for the better part of the confrontation, and then something happened which made it go tepid at the drop of a hat.\n\nVic pulled the trigger.\n\nA steel toed boot shattered the rod and coated my insides in innumerable shards, biting every which way.\n\nBut the gun hadn\u2019t fired.\n\nI\u2019m sure that he was caught off guard just as much as I had.\n\nFor one brief moment right before I turned tail to run, I saw the safety latch on the side of the gun. It was on, and as you can expect, I didn\u2019t miss a beat in making the most out of this divine opportunity.\n\nDespite the indescribable pain that I felt, I managed to lumber down the stairs as I could still barely hear Vic.\n\nBut when I heard the first shot after he\u2019d finally taken off the safety, I ran down the cold street, my coat flying behind me like a parachute that threatened to slow me down.\n\nEach step I took blended my insides further, and although it felt like I was running through water, I, nonetheless, made it to my friend, Sasha\u2019s house\n\nEven though I had made it out without having sustained any kind of injury, how I felt was still far from alright.\n\nAfter a brief explanation to Sasha (which made her seem even more scared than I had been) I hurried to the upstairs bathroom where I proceeded to lock myself in and sit on the floor, utterly exhausted \u2013 both mentally and physically \u2013 from that night\u2019s ordeal.\n\nI got my phone out to text my mother, but as I was typing, Vic called just as my finger was about to press a button.\n\nA button right in place where the answer button was.\n\nIn the interval between me accidentally answering my phone and hanging up (which took about as long to do as reading a faithful Nabokov stanza), I heard Vic shouting something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019LL FIND YOU AND I WILL MAKE SURE TH-\u201c.\n\nThe thought that I, and to an extent my friends and family, could still be in danger, as his words no doubt implied, filled me with a dread that pushed those damned shards deeper than any syringe could ever go. My nerves felt like they had been spliced to oblivion, but I still somehow found a way to stand up and leave the bathroom.\n\nIt\u2019s strange.\n\nI went to sleep after writing about Vic, but I didn\u2019t dream about him.\n\nAt least I think I didn\u2019t.\n\nWhen I woke up today (day three, if I\u2019m right), I opened the journal on my nightstand, ready to scribble down whatever dreams I\u2019d had (recently, I haven\u2019t been waking up in the middle of the night anymore) but to my dismay, nothing came to mind. I was sure I\u2019d been a part of a vivid dream, so real it makes you question the waking world, but I remembered absolutely nothing.\n\nAnd so, I take it as a sign that I should just get on with the story.\n\nLet\u2019s just say that I was a bit of a mess after my confrontation with Vic, and in the following days. I was worried sick that he\u2019d show up out of nowhere to hurt my friends or my family, and I must\u2019ve spent at least a solid week couch ridden with stale muscles, dried tear ducts, and enough cortisol to make any heart shrivel up like the lungs of a lifelong chain-smoker.\n\nI was a wreck, to put it simply.\n\nBut after the seventh day, when it felt like my body was collapsing into itself like a beached whale, I remembered what Vic had said to me, but instead of feeling fear this time, I felt a seething and scalding anger the likes of which I haven\u2019t felt since.\n\nI was angry that I had been reduced to such a state.\n\nI imagined bludgeoning that fucker\u2019s face in with a sledge hammer, or throwing him off of the Empire State building, and a number of other creative ways of disposal that I care not to mention for fear of distracting from the point of this story.\n\nThe point of this is that I\u2019d had enough.\n\nI was fed up.\n\nAnd I decided to take action.\n\nI did so by moving out of my friend\u2019s house, applying to a few new positions, and getting a new house.\n\nI wonder if I saw that house in my dreams.\n\nIt really was a nice house.\n\nA quaint two-story Carpenter gothic home.\n\nA dream house of mine to say the least.\n\nI can\u2019t remember why, but for some reason I recall feeling safe there, in that little oversized shed with modern plumbing.\n\nI was in the middle of nowhere.\n\nAnd yet I\u2019d never felt safer from the outside.\n\nIt was like my own private base camp, safe and isolated from the chaos of the outside.\n\nI thought that I\u2019d finally outwitted my demons.\n\nBut one phrase still nagged me.\n\n\u201cFool me twice, shame on me.\u201d\n\nThat was my mentality when I met Arthur.\n\nArthur was a co-worker of mine.\n\nAnd he also happens to be the third man to have put a glass rod in me.\n\nOne that I never noticed until it was far too late.\n\nBut\u2026that comes later.\n\nWhat comes now, or rather what came before, was my work relation with him.\n\nI first met Arthur when I was assigned to a new project, and he was one of my team members.\n\nArthur was a few years younger than me, fresh out of college, and had that eagerness about him that all new corporate recruits have (before it\u2019s crushed by the corporation, that is).\n\nThis was a hell of a workload, so Arthur and I often had to work nights as our other less productive team members would always retire the moment day turned to night.\n\nNot me and Arthur though.\n\nWe\u2019d work well into the early hours of the morning, and often find ourselves talking about a wide range of topics. He was quite knowledgeable, and\u2026I enjoyed talking to him about anything and everything that came to mind.\n\nHe was sweet and sensitive and never complained whenever I\u2019d tell him to rework a section of a report or to even scrap it.\n\nFast forward to a couple of months and the two of us were both promoted thanks to that project, the one which got us closer.\n\nAnd\u2026to celebrate, Arthur asked me out to a fancy work lunch at an expensive restaurant and I\u2026I went.\n\nDressed in my best clothes and him too.\n\nI can still remember it even as I write this.\n\nGuess a few loose shards made it deeper than I expected.\n\nWe were surrounded by people, drinking, eating and enjoying themselves, and that\u2019s what we were doing too.\n\nThings really were\u2026going well.\n\nThat was until Arthur started to look nervous.\n\nI thought that it was cute at first, but as the night dragged on, and he began to sweat more profusely, I began to worry.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worry for another person.\n\nIt was worry about your own well-being.\n\nA feeling of uncomfortableness your gut warns you with, it\u2019s wails reverberating through your insides like a grenade in a pond.\n\nAnd then it happened.\n\nArthur asked me out and\u2026it shattered.\n\nMy heart that is.\n\nIn that moment, it hit me that throughout all my conversations with him during those weeks,I had never revealed to Arthur that I was a lesbian.\n\nAnd when my brain connected two and two together, and I looked back on the whole evening, I felt like crying for some reason.\n\nBecause I knew that he was about to learn the truth in what was no doubt a humiliating way.\n\nI knew he would learn it because I knew I would tell him.\n\nAnd\u2026I did.\n\nAnd then something really did shatter.\n\nI heard it when the words came out of my mouth and sailed through the air and right into his eager ears.\n\nHe didn\u2019t cry.\n\nHis face didn\u2019t sour.\n\nHe was smiling, and even gave a nervous, apologetic chuckle of sorts.\n\nBut none of that made me feel any better.\n\nArthur did his best to play the whole thing down, and even made some self-deprecating jokes to lighten the mood, but I still remained unconvinced.\n\nMy mind knew full well what it had heard.\n\nAnd it played it on repeat for me to endlessly hear.\n\nI kept hearing it as Arthur talked.\n\nI kept hearing it as we both awkwardly bid each other goodnight.\n\nI kept hearing it as I drove home.\n\nEven the rain that was falling wasn\u2019t enough to drown it out.\n\nAnd I kept hearing and hearing it without fail until I stepped through my door, absolutely drenched due to my hesitation to go into my own quaint house.\n\nAnd it was then, in my living room, after I flipped on the light switch, that what I had heard finally clicked..\n\nA glass rod shattering.\n\nBut not mine.\n\nArthur\u2019s.\n\nI\u2019d\u2026put a rod in him, right into his extended urethra, just like Dean Allen Cole would.\n\nAnd I had stepped on it, heels and all, with every ounce of might that my frame could possibly allow me.\n\nAnd all night he\u2019d had to bear the pain while looking at the one who\u2019d inflicted it on him.\n\nAll night he\u2019d worried about the gazes of everyone else, absolutely terrified of them finding out.\n\nBut then I found myself in my bathroom, my eyes pierced by their own gaze, and with a growing sickness I was confronted with the fact that it had been me who\u2019d belittled him with sight.\n\nThe looks of pity.\n\nThe looks of frustration.\n\nThe looks of awkwardness.\n\nAll of them had come from me.\n\nWeb-like cracks that spread the longer the dinner dragged on.\n\nI hadn\u2019t shattered the rod immediately.\n\nI\u2019d taken my sweet, sweet time until it finally gave way to the pressure I was exerting.\n\nIt shattered and the cascading fractures never stopped reverberating in my head.\n\nThe pelting of the rain outside my window now felt like the incessant banging of a mob trying to get in.\n\nI felt judged and condemned by the world itself at that moment.\n\nI could feel that the fog was back again, tickling and stroking my skin as it slowly crawled up my legs.\n\nBut then it withdrew without warning.\n\nIt desperately tried to reach me, but to no avail, kept at bay by a force that had no intention of letting it slithering an inch higher.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I heard it.\n\nAmidst the endless strafing from the clouds outside, I heard a single sound that was louder and less frequent.\n\nA knock.\n\nA bolt of lightning flashed in the distance, and the lights in my bathroom immediately went out, just as a wave of thunder shook the air.\n\nAnd in the darkness that my mirror now showed me, I saw them.\n\nEyes.\n\nTwo eyes.\n\nTwo richly yellow eyes with slit pupils cutting through the glass of my window and looking straight at me.\n\nThe knocks of the unknown creature didn\u2019t stop, and so I went over to the window.\n\nEven though I opened it just a crack, the assault of the rain from outside pushed it further, allowing the shadow with yellow eyes to lunge in.\n\nI quickly closed the window and felt a wave of panic rush through me. It was too dark to see anything, but I was sure that whatever had come in was still in the bathroom with me.\n\nAnd then I heard it.\n\nA meow.\n\nThe fog was gone now.\n\nThe lights came back on again, and I found myself face to face with the quaintest cat you can imagine.\n\nEyes like impeccably polished citrine gemstones and long fur like the bristles of used oil brushes.\n\nThe cat came up to me and rubbed its fur \u2013 softer than I had initially given it credit for \u2013 against my leg. I picked it up carefully, worried it would scratch, but instead, it purred gregariously in my arms and licked my skin.\n\nI\u2019d made a new male friend that night, one I thought, amidst the tears of joy and heart-warming purring, I could finally trust.\n\nLittle did I know at that moment that another rod had been put inside of me.\n\n\u2026\n\nThings happened\u2026unprecedently fast after the cat \u2013 Jasper \u2013 came into my life.\n\nWhen I went back to work, I found that Arthur had quit.\n\nI think it was about a week after he quit (roughly two weeks after Jasper had come into my life) when the police knocked at my door.\n\nAccording to the officers, after our altercation, Vic had apparently gone back to live with his mother in the outskirts of town, and he\u2019d been found the day before in the woods mauled to the point of being almost unrecognizable.\n\nThey just wanted to ask me a few questions since the camera in our apartment complex had caught me fleeing from him that day. I was assured that I wasn\u2019t a suspect since they\u2019d checked my alibi and it had been airtight.\n\nThe questioning lasted for about an hour, and I did have to answer my fair share of questions.\n\nJasper was quite skittish during this process, hiding behind a corner and hissing loudly when one of the cops bent down to pet him.\n\nThings became oddly peaceful after this.\n\nWith the threat of Vic now gone, I felt free to enjoy my life to its fullest.\n\nIt was just me and Jasper for about a month, and there wasn\u2019t any cat in the whole world more affectionate than him.\n\nFollowing my company\u2019s merger with another, a party was held to break the ice between employees of the company we\u2019d absorbed, and it was at this party \u2013 a party that I will always remember \u2013 where I met her.\n\nAngie.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t so much that my heart was pierced by Cupid\u2019s arrow as much as I\u2019d fallen head-first in a pit full of them.\n\nHer shoulder length hair coiled like a parade of snakes and her eyes seemed to level everything before them, including me.\n\nShe \u2013 like me \u2013 seemed to be the only other person who looked uncomfortable at this party, and I said fuck it.\n\nI decided to talk to her.\n\nAnd\u2026I\u2019m still not sure if I regret it or not.\n\nThings moved quickly after that.\n\nA friendly greeting turned into a friendly conversation.\n\nThat somehow ended up turning into a friendly meeting.\n\nAnd then\u2026we were a couple.\n\nThese last three sentences took me over an hour to write.\n\nI kept rewriting and deleting words, the memories of my times with Angie bubbling up after laying at the bottom of my mind for more than I\u2019m willing to admit.\n\nThese were fantastic memories, and for once, I really did feel like I belonged, and I can only hope that I gave her the same feeling as well.\n\nEverything was as good as it could possibly be, but then things\u2026started to go downhill when Angie moved in with me.\n\nIt was around this time that Jasper began to act out.\n\nThroughout this entire time, I\u2019d felt myself grow more distant from Jasper, and he didn\u2019t like that one bit, but when Angie moved in with me, my once affectionate cat seemed to change overnight.\n\nNo longer was he eager to eat food or lay in my lap.\n\nHe\u2019d always scratch and screech at Angie if she so much as looked at him.\n\nBad as they were, the two of us still tolerated his behavior and thought of it as nothing more than a pet being resistant to sudden change.\n\nAnd then something else changed.\n\nSomething for the worst.\n\nThe company that me and Angie both worked for underwent a massive wave of layoffs, and Angie didn\u2019t make the cut.\n\nShe was a wonderful and hard worker, and I was convinced that the sole reason for her firing had been because she was openly Bi (I\u2019d managed to escape such a fate because I\u2019d kept my lesbianism a secret). I wanted to press charges, to spread a video online, basically anything that could help my girlfriend regain her earned position.\n\nBut Angie didn\u2019t care, and so I put thoughts of revenge at the back of my mind as per her wishes.\n\nLess workers meant more workload for me, which in turn meant more late nights at the office, which in turn meant less time with my wonderful girlfriend.\n\nI\u2019d often find myself exasperated in front of my haughty screen, only for Angie to give me a quick call and fill me with all of the energy in the world.\n\nShe\u2019d tell me how she missed me, the delicious things she\u2019d prepared for the two of us, what prospective jobs she was interviewing for or had been rejected from, and Jasper, as always, was still a handful, but nothing she couldn\u2019t handle.\n\nThings at this point were stressful for the both of us, but whatever time we\u2019d managed to spend together made it all worthwhile ten times over.\n\nBut as days turned into months, I found my relationship with Angie becoming more and more strained.\n\nAt first, it started with our phone calls becoming shorter and shorter.\n\nThen she wouldn\u2019t call at all.\n\nThen we saw less and less of each other at home, until we felt like strangers.\n\nI sure as hell wasn\u2019t blind to this by any means.\n\nBut Angie sure as hell wasn\u2019t sharing jack.\n\nI pondered over the issue for several days, until one day when Angie had left the house and I took this as an opportunity to clean it.\n\nBut when I lifted a corner of our shared bed to change the sheets, I found a large, thin, and unassuming notebook under it.\n\nOne look at the contents and I could tell immediately that this was Angie\u2019s (due to the distinct handwriting).\n\nFlipping through it, I found myself confronted with page after page describing vehement nightmares.\n\nAlmost all the entries followed the same general layout.\n\nThey\u2019d describe Angie in her room at night, while trying to sleep, and a horrible monster coming through the doorway. She\u2019d find herself unable to move as this monster, whatever it was, would run its claws along her body, and it would only go away when I\u2019d come from work.\n\nThe journal described how my girlfriend couldn\u2019t stand my cat because it \u201csmelled just like the monster\u201d.\n\nI flipped through months-worth of pages upon pages and entry after entry.\n\nI read each and every word, until of course, Angie came home from another interview.\n\nThat was the night we had our first true fight.\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing we didn\u2019t have any neighbors.\n\nWe were screaming at each other, pointing fingers, and crying at the same time.\n\nI confronted her about the notes and, at first, she was pissed that I\u2019d read through her private thoughts. Angie kept going on about how she thought that the dreams were a sign that I was changing and that she was afraid of me coming home; that she didn\u2019t want to see the person I had become. But then, quite suddenly I might say, in the middle of a sentence, she broke down crying and apologizing.\n\nBut I was still angry and frustrated.\n\nI regret a lot of things in my life, but most of them are what I told Angie that night.\n\nWhen it was all said and done, my lungs felt as though I\u2019d had to inflate a car tire, and Angie looked at me speechless.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t crying anymore.\n\nAnd I knew that something far worse was happening behind those eyes.\n\nThat\u2019s when everything I\u2019d said finally reached my ears.\n\nBut by the time regret had come, it was far too late.\n\nA week of silence passed.\n\nI just remembered a Samuel Beckett Quote.\n\n\u201cEvery word is like an unnecessary stain on silence and nothingness.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d say I\u2026disagree with that. Every word is like a brush stroke on nothingness. Without them, life is something blank and meaningless.\n\nNone of us would speak, so everything was blank.\n\nNow, I wish I\u2019d picked up my brush sooner.\n\nI remember sitting on my porch, with Jasper purring on my lap.\n\nAngie was inside, and I just stared at the quiet darkness in front of me.\n\nI started to talk to Jasper, meekly venting about my problems.\n\nI told him that I was tired of the silence.\n\nTomorrow, after coming from work, I would break it.\n\nI resolved to do so.\n\nJasper had stopped purring by that point.\n\nI knew he wasn\u2019t asleep.\n\nInstead, both of us sat in silence.\n\nWell, that was a lot, wasn\u2019t it?\n\nMy fingers do feel rather numb.\n\nI\u2019m stopping now at this point.\n\nThis next part\u2026I\u2019ll have to sleep on it.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe day in question had arrived. Throughout the whole day I couldn\u2019t focus one single bit on the work that had been assigned to me. Instead, I anxiously monitored each and every tick of the office clock, waiting for five to finally roll around.\n\nThe phone rang once at around three, but I didn\u2019t pick it up.\n\nAfter much anticipation (mixed with the expected amount of dread), I opened my eyes after a hard blink and found myself driving to my house out in the woods.\n\nI\u2019m not sure now, but I swear that I remember fog along the road as I drove closer and closer.\n\nI did finally arrive, but when I tried to open the door, it wouldn\u2019t budge at all. I fiddled with the knob for a bit before a sudden sensation on my shin made me jump back.\n\nJasper had come out of the small dog hatch, and my heart sank deep into my stomach when I saw that he was covered in blood.\n\nWaiting for the authorities to arrive felt like it took even longer than waiting for five o'clock to come around.\n\nI\u2019ve wondered a lot about why I didn\u2019t just kick down the door or try harder to get in. I like to think and believe that the mind works and rationalizes differently in times of stress, and while I do believe that to be true, it feels disgusting to justify my inaction like that.\n\nTwo officers came, and one of them knocked down the door, and in the house, behind said door, is where we found Angie.\n\nHer body anyhow.",

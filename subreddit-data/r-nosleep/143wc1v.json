    "postText": "The way I see it, if you don\u2019t notice that I exist, then I\u2019m doing my job correctly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy name is Ben McFarlane and I work as a municipal sewer inspector in the town of Tevam Sound, Ontario. It's not the most glamorous job, but hey, somebody's got to do it and it puts food on the table.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou'd probably think that working as a sewer inspector isn't that exciting\u2026 and yeah, for the most part you'd be right. Most of the time, all I'm doing is checking the pipes for damage. Unless there\u2019s a reason for me to investigate a certain area, most of what I do is routine inspection, which helps ensure that the sewers remain in good working order. Trust me, nobody wants to see what happens when they aren\u2019t.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThankfully, a lot of what I do can be done without me needing to crawl through pipes. I can use a small camera to help me do the inspection. But with some of the larger pipes and cisterns, I need to actually go inside and take a look.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s never the best part of my day, but like I said before: somebody\u2019s got to do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoing down into the bigger tunnels is always a little unnerving. Part of it is the claustrophobic atmosphere and part of it is the knowledge that you\u2019re basically standing in a river of literal human waste. I can deal with it now, but back when I first started the smell alone was darn near impossible to deal with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAsk most sanitation workers and I'm sure they'll have stories about what they've found in the sewers before. Heck, most of it isn't even stuff that people flush down the toilet. It's the stuff that people drop down manhole covers, or the stuff that gets washed into the sewers by the rain. Dead animals are surprisingly common, as are kids toys. I found an entire bicycle in the sewer once and I've got a buddy who found a loaded gun down there! Someone probably thought they'd get rid of it by just tossing it in the sewer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomeone was wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut of all the strange things I've experienced during my time working in the sewers\u2026 none of it compares to the stuff I see in the pipes on the southeast side of town.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe things down there\u2026 I don't usually like to talk about them. Heck, I might not even be legally allowed to talk about them. I guess we'll find out, won't we? I've had a few drinks tonight and I'm feeling particularly chatty. So why not spill the beans? Hey, maybe someone out there will tell me something I don\u2019t already know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019d been on the job for about a year or so before getting sent to the southeast side of town. It\u2019s closer to the lake and the downtown area, so there\u2019s some deeper pipes there. I\u2019d always figured that that was the reason they only really ever sent certain people down there. I\u2019d heard that those tunnels were old and a little labyrinthian. Anyone who didn\u2019t know what they were doing could easily get lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut after we got hit with a particularly nasty rain storm back in summer of 2013, they needed to send someone down to check on some sensors and I just so happened to be one of the guys who was available.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA bad rain storm can push a sewer system to its limit, so it wasn\u2019t really that surprising that we\u2019d gotten that kind of call and at the time, I didn\u2019t think that there was anything that strange about it. My supervisor told me to head on down toward the pumphouse on the southwest side of town like it was any other priority inspection, and I went along with no questions asked. It was a few streets away from downtown. I\u2019d seen it before but never had a reason to go inside up until then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was working with a couple of other newbies at the time, a guy by the name of Stewart Long who\u2019d only been on the job for a round three months or so, and another guy by the name of Tomas Opunui who\u2019d started around the same time that I had.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe\u2019d arrived at the pumphouse, and when we got there we noticed another team waiting on us. This wasn\u2019t too shocking either. Depending on the size of the job, they might\u2019ve sent some other guys in to help us handle it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe guy in charge was an older man who looked to be pushing sixty. He had sort of a \u2018Santa Claus on summer vacation\u2019 look, with white hair, a short white beard, a big beer belly and a no nonsense expression.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe watched us get out of his truck with a look of stern disapproval, before huffing and trudging over to us.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the usual fellas?\u201d He asked.\n\n\u201cI dunno, out. They called us,\u201d I replied.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe didn\u2019t seem to like that answer but didn\u2019t say anything in response to it.\n\n\u201cYou ever worked on the southeast approach channel before?\u201d He asked.\n\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve been in the ones on the north side of town,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I asked, kid. You ever worked in *this one* before?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething about the way he asked this question struck me as a little odd. I\u2019d worked in an approach channel before. I knew the drill. What did it matter which one I\u2019d worked in?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the unenlightened, an approach channel is a cistern filled with wastewater. They feed into a deep tunnel which feeds into a water treatment plant and they\u2019re considered to be fairly dangerous, due to their depth (if you fall off the ladder on your way down, you\u2019re in for a long drop into a biohazardous lake unless you\u2019re properly tethered) and the harmful gasses that can accumulate in them. Standard operating procedure is to always test the air before entering one just to make sure that it\u2019s even safe to breathe down there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing reckless while going into an approach channel is a recipe for disaster, and I would have understood if the old man was concerned about us not having dealt with one before. But the way he spoke to us implied that this one was different somehow, which didn\u2019t make a whole heck of a lot of sense to me.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d I asked. \u201cSame procedure, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not the same procedure. We need people experienced with *this* approach channel. These tunnels are a little different than what you\u2019re used to.\n\n\u201cLook, the boss sent us here. So I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll manage,\u201d Tomas said. \u201cYou can show us what we need to know.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Old Man didn\u2019t respond to him. He just shook his head and turned away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna call this in and clear it with the boss first. You three, don\u2019t move until I get back.\u201d\n\nI traded a look with both Tomas and Long as the Old Man trudged away. He said something to the two guys who were with him, before getting back into his truck to make a call.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart of me was obliged to try and just get to work. But looking at the other two guys that the Old Man had with him, I had a feeling that they\u2019d try to stop me. One of them, another older guy with a receding hairline and a bushy moustache was watching us like a hawk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we waited.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a few minutes, the Old Man got out of his truck again, said something to his buddy with the mustache and trudged back over to us.\n\n\u201cBad news, fellas. Looks like our usual company\u2019s retired\u2026 guess you\u2019re the replacement.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we can get to work?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYeah. We can get to work,\u201d The Old Man said. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get going.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that, he turned and led us into the pumphouse.\n\n\u201cSuppose I might as well introduce myself. Names Troy. My colleagues here are Craig and Peter.\u201d\n\nHe gestured to the two men who were with him, Mr. Moustache (who I assumed was Craig) and the other guy, who looked to be in his mid thirties and had sunken eyes, as if he hadn\u2019t slept in a few days. The one who I assumed was Craig just gave us a nod, while the guy I figured was Peter gave a lazy half wave before they followed us into the pumphouse.\n\n\u201cSo if you don\u2019t mind my asking, what\u2019s so special about this channel?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI guess you\u2019ll be seeing for yourself soon enough,\u201d Troy replied as he started down a set of stairs. \u201cThe guys you\u2019re replacing\u2026 well, guy\u2026 a fella named Tom\u2026 he always had a set of rules for working down here. He passed \u2018em on to me and Craig when we started. We\u2019ve passed \u2018em on to Peter. Guess it\u2019s time we passed \u2018em on to you too.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cRules?\u201d I asked, \u201cWhat kind of rules?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe kind you listen very, very closely to, kid.\u201dTroy looked back at me, before his eyes shifted to Tomas and Long behind me.\n\n\u201cVery, very closely.\u201d\n\nHe descended the rest of the way down the stairs, where there was a hatch in the concrete floor beneath us, along with a large locker on the far side of the room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cRule number one,\u201d Troy began. \u201cYou don\u2019t enter this part of the sewers alone. You stay in a group of at least three to four at all times. No more, no less. Too many and it slows you down. Too few, and you might not come back at all.\u201d\n\nHe trailed off, watching as Craig cracked open the hatch to test the air inside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cRule number two: You do not enter this part of the sewers without a gun and a radio.\u201d\n\nHe opened the locker on the far side of the room and I was taken aback to see a collection of several handguns inside, along with boxes of ammunition and one shotgun in amongst the usual PPE.\n\nTroy clipped one of the guns to his belt, along with one of the radios, before handing a pair off to Peter and looking over at us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s taking it?\u201d He asked.\n\n\u201cWhoa, just hold up for a minute!\u201d Long interjected, \u201cWhat the hell is down there?\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Troy replied. \u201cHate to say it but it ain\u2019t our job to know. I leave that to someone else. Our job is to follow the rules. You follow them, and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nLong seemed skeptical, but I looked at the gun in Troy\u2019s hand and took it. I wasn\u2019t sure if he was having a laugh with us or not, but I was there to do a job and I intended to do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTroy gave me a quiet nod, before thrusting the second gun over to Long. He didn\u2019t seem to happy to get it.\n\n\u201cAre we gonna have to use these?\u201d He asked.\n\n\u201cNot if you do as I say, you won\u2019t. Rule 3: If you see a pipe or a tunnel with heavy spiderwebs, don\u2019t go down it. Doesn\u2019t matter if that\u2019s where the sensor is. You make a note of it, report it to your supervisor and leave it alone.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpiderwebs? What the hell was he talking about?\n\n\u201cRule 4: If you find a body\u2026 and odds are, you *will* find a body, don\u2019t touch it. Don\u2019t try to move it. Hell, don\u2019t even get close to it. And don\u2019t waste the supervisors time reporting it. Only time the bodies get reported is when they\u2019re human.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019ve been finding human bodies down there?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cRarely,\u201d He replied. \u201cBut it\u2019s been known to happen. And if we do find one\u2026 the same rules apply. Don\u2019t approach it. Don\u2019t touch it. Stay as far away as possible.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could see some of the color draining from Long\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cRule 5: If you see anyone else down there, you are *not* to interact with them. You do not follow them if they try to lead you somewhere, if they ask you for help, you do not help them. I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re crying and begging. You leave them alone. You report it to your supervisor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are *people* down there?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNormally, no. Far as I know, Tom only ever ran into a couple during his career. I\u2019ve only ever seen one. Like I said, best to leave them alone.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, \u201cIf there\u2019s someone stuck down there, we have an obligation to help them!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be very ill advised,\u201d Troy said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to anger the things that are down there\u2026 which leads me to rule 6: Avoid killing *anything* you come across down there. They\u2019re not yours to kill. And if you have absolutely no choice, if you *have* to break that rule for the sake of self defense, then we leave *immediately.* That\u2019s rule number 7.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cAir\u2019s safe down there,\u201d Craig said, interrupting our conversation.\n\n\u201cGood. Let\u2019s get suited up, then. Oh\u2026 and rule 8. Final rule. If *anything* happens to any member of our team, we leave immediately. We don\u2019t go after them. We don\u2019t try to help them. We leave *immediately.* Is that clear? I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s me, begging you for help. You leave me behind.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong and I remained silent, neither of us entirely sure how to react to this or even what to say. Troy had made it sound as if we were about to descend into a level of hell. I couldn\u2019t imagine what the hell could possibly be down there to elicit a list of rules like that, and I wasn\u2019t entirely sure I wanted to find out either!\n\n\u201cWell? You fellas getting ready or not?\u201d Troy asked impatiently as he put on his PPE. \u201cThe quicker we get down there, the quicker we can get out again!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cIf this is so dangerous, why are they sending us?\u201d Long asked, \u201cShouldn\u2019t they be sending\u2026 I dunno, the cops or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey tolerate us being down there, so long as we don\u2019t disturb them. They wouldn\u2019t be so forgiving toward the local police,\u201d Troy replied. \u201cListen, kid. Obey the rules and you\u2019ll be fine, got that? We\u2019ve been doing this for years without any problems. You keep your head on your shoulders, you do what we say and you go home safe. Alright?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong still didn\u2019t seem convinced, but I did. By this point, I was morbidly curious about exactly what was down there\u2026 and Troy\u2019s assurance that they\u2019d come out unscathed before did set me at ease a little bit. These rules *sounded* kinda scary, but what could realistically go wrong? With Troy keeping us in line, everything would probably be fine and besides, I still wasn\u2019t convinced that this wasn\u2019t all some sort of elaborate prank the old man was pulling. I grabbed myself a set of PPE and got ready and after a moments hesitation, Long did the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we were ready, Craig opened up the hatch in the floor, and Tomas helped get us tethered so that we wouldn\u2019t plummet down into the waters below if we slipped on the ladder, then we finally began our descent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTroy went first, climbing down the ladder and into the darkness below. I went second, followed by Peter and followed by Long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe climbed down into the approach channel in relative silence, only really speaking again once we made it to the bottom of the ladder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTroy helped me get untethered, before doing the same for Peter and Long as they reached the bottom, and while he did that I got my first look at the dreaded southeast approach channel. I can\u2019t say that there was a heck of a lot to see. The walls were boxy and flat, and the dirty wastewater trickled over my boots and into the pipe sending it even deeper through the sewer system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sensors should have been mounted on the ceiling, and I traced the black conduit line with my flashlight as I searched for the sensor they connected to. Peter and Long stayed back as Tomas and Craig lowered our tools down after us, while Troy came up behind me.\n\n\u201cShould be quick work\u2026\u201d He noted, \u201cRain doesn\u2019t seem to have done much in here. Water level is still fairly low.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw his flashlight shift upward toward the ceiling before he spotted the sensor. He trudged through the water to get closer to it, and I followed him.\n\n\u201cNo external damage,\u201d I noted. \u201cConduit lines look good too.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll run our tests and get out of here,\u201d Troy said. \u201cApproach channel is usually pretty safe\u2026 usually.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsually?\u201d I asked, and Troy pointed his flashlight up toward a set of silky spiderwebs hanging from the ceiling a few feet behind the sensor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t typically come up here\u2026 but every now and then you might find some proof of some young ones, trying to get into the pumphouse.\u201d\n\nI looked over at him.\n\n\u201cThey try to break into the pumphouse?\u201d I asked, \u201cDid they ever get in?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that I\u2019ve ever heard of. Can\u2019t imagine they\u2019d stay long if they did. Nothing to eat in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat exactly are *they?\u201d* I asked, \u201cAnd don\u2019t you tell me that\u2019s not for us to know. You\u2019ve seen them, right? What do they look like?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTroy had started to answer, when suddenly I heard Long screaming and swearing up a storm. Both of us turned to look, just in time to see something large skittering up the wall beside him. I only caught a brief glimpse of it, but it seemed to be roughly the size of a dog with more legs than I could count. Long stared at it with wide, horrified eyes as he fumbled with his gun, before pulling it free.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw Troy\u2019s eyes widen before Long fired five times. Only one or two of the bullets actually hit the target. I heard Peter cry out in pain and grab at his arm before falling and whatever it was that Long had actually been shooting at collapsed into the shallow water, its pale body twitching violently.\n\n*\u201cWhat did you just do?!\u201d* Troy demanded, running over to Peter\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cI-it was coming for me!\u201d Long protested, before noticing what he\u2019d done to Peter. I saw his eyes widen in horror.\n\n\u201cOh no\u2026 no, no, no\u2026 I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cRule 6! You don\u2019t kill anything down here! You leave them alone and they leave you alone!\u201d Troy roared, before his attention returned to Peter. \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cJ-just a scratch, boss\u2026 I think I got hit by the ricochet,\u201d Peter said, as Troy inspected his wound. I\u2019ve never seen a gunshot wound before, but there was a lot of blood for it to just be a scratch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get you topside,\u201d Troy said. \u201cAnd come back down tomorrow with someone who knows how to follow rules!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe shot Long a death glare before his radio crackled to life.\n\n*\u201cTroy, everything good down there?\u201d* Craig asked.\n\n\u201cNo, no it isn\u2019t. One of the newbies got jumpy, shot at a centipede.\u201d He huffed, \u201cPut a hole in Peter in the process. Think you can reel him back up?\u201d\n\n*\u201cYeah, sure thing. Hook him up. Tomas and I will bring him topside.\u201d*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTroy quietly hooked Peter up to the line, before helping him onto the ladder.\n\n\u201cYou take it easy on the way up, and we\u2019ll get that checked out,\u201d He promised.\n\n\u201cThanks boss,\u201d Peter said quietly.\n\nTroy\u2019s attention returned to Long next, as he fixed him in a death glare.\n\n\u201cYou, up the ladder behind him. And you\u2026\u201d He looked at me, his expression softening just a little.\n\n\u201cBehind him. I\u2019ll go up last.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeter started to meekly climb the ladder, although it seemed like Craig and Tomas were doing most of the work, hoisting him up rung by rung. Once he\u2019d made it part of the way up, Long started to hook himself up to climb behind him. Although before he could hook himself in, I saw him pause for a moment, staring at Troy.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Troy asked, before pausing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong craned his neck a little, his hand moving down to his gun again\u2026 and it was then that both Troy and I realized that he hadn\u2019t been looking at Troy. He\u2019d been looking at what was behind him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI only saw a shadow, perched on the roof of the tunnel. But that was all that Long needed to see before he started shooting again.\n\n\u201cDON\u2019T!\u201d\n\nBut by the time Troy had gotten the word out, that trigger happy idiot had already started shooting again and this time, the thing that came for him didn\u2019t drop dead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstead, it launched itself off of the ceiling of the tunnel, crashing into the ground a few feet away from me.\n\n\u201cWAIT!\u201d Troy tried to protest before the thing in front of us knocked him aside, dashing him against the wall. Long scrambled away, retreating deeper into the tunnel while Peter frantically tried to unholster his gun.\n\n*\u201cTroy? Troy, what\u2019s going on down there?\u201d* I heard Craig calling over the radio, \u201c*Troy? Anyone, respond!\u201d*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe shape in front of us turned, looking over at me and Long. Eight eyes shone in the darkness and though I could only see the shadow of the creature before us, I saw enough. It had a body like a spider, with eight long chitinous legs. Only its body was much larger than any spider I\u2019d ever seen before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Much, much larger.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis creature was almost the size of a small car, but it wasn\u2019t its size that terrified me. It was the humanoid torso coming out of the front of it. The two arms that ended in razor sharp claws, the snarling mouth that made noises that almost sounded human.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen this impossible thing looked at us, I saw real intelligence in its eyes. It was studying us, trying to determine how much of a threat we were\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong kept his gun trained on it, hands shaking violently. I knew that he was going to shoot again, and hoping not to anger this thing, grabbed his arm, trying to force his gun down. He jumped the moment that I touched him giving me a hysterical look.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d I snapped, \u201cYou\u2019re just gonna piss it off!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Spider took a step toward us, hissing as it did. Long pulled away from me.\n\n\u201cStu!\u201d\n\nI tried calling his name, but Long had already made his choice and sealed his fate. He\u2019d opted to fight this thing. And so, like the fool he was he shot at it again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Spider lunged for us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ran. Long didn\u2019t.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe only had enough time to scream before it pounced on him, and then\u2026 all I could hear were the dying screams in his throat as he was pulled apart. I didn\u2019t see him die. But I didn\u2019t need to. I heard *everything.* I kept running, not even thinking about where the approach channel was going to end. And when it did end, all I could do was plummet into the darkness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSee, at the end of an approach channel is what is appropriately called a drop shaft. It\u2019s where the water flows into a larger tunnel beneath the city. *That* tunnel, flows into the water treatment plant, eventually and the water down there\u2026 yeah\u2026 let\u2019s just say that you don\u2019t want to end up in the water down there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, that was exactly where I was going.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know that every job has its struggles, but I didn\u2019t expect to need to choose between diving into raw sewage and fighting a giant spider monster when I woke up that morning. However the choice was presented to me and I did the best that I could given the circumstances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoing into the wastewater was exactly an unpleasant experience as you\u2019d think it would be. I\u2019m inclined not to share the details of what it was like, simply because I genuinely do not want to remember them and I\u2019m still not entirely convinced that dealing with the giant angry spider person wasn\u2019t the better choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA small comfort was that the pain of hitting the water, combined with the confusing sensation of being flushed through a pipe and into an even larger pipe made the whole experience slightly less disgusting, at the cost of being considerably more painful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the end of it, I was washed out into the main pipe and collapsed into the water, covered in filth and gagging from the stench that had sank into my every pore. I felt disoriented and confused. I tried to stand, only to collapse back into the wastewater, before aimlessly looking around, hoping that maybe I could figure out what direction to go in. It was too dark to see much of anything and I\u2019d lost my flashlight during my trip through the wastewater, so I was left to just wander aimlessly, following what I thought was the flow of the water as my eyes slowly started to acclimate to the darkness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could feel shapes in the water. Some of them I almost tripped over and I could smell rotting meat on top of the stink of human waste. In the darkness, I could make out shapes in the water and hear the buzzing of bugs around me. I could even feel a few whizz past my head and mindlessly swatted at them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOld bones crunched under my boots, and I quietly thanked whatever God was listening that I couldn\u2019t see what they\u2019d belonged to. I wanted to assume they were animal bones\u2026 but who knew, right? I couldn\u2019t shake the mental image of myself unknowingly stepping over the mauled corpse of Stewart Long\u2026 although that was more from the trauma of having recently witnessed a man die than any guilt over what had happened to him. Long had quite literally gotten himself killed. Although I was terrified that I\u2019d be joining him at any second.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI kept listening in, half expecting to hear spider legs creeping up behind me. But it was impossible to tell if I was alone or not in that darkness and with the bugs buzzing past me. If there were anything after me, I truly would not know it until after it had pounced.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStill, I knew I couldn\u2019t afford to let the fear get the better of me. So I just kept walking, hoping that maybe if I did, I\u2019d somehow find myself at the water treatment plant and maybe then I\u2019d get some help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I pressed on, I noticed a light ahead of me and picked up the pace, hoping to God that I\u2019d finally found my way out of this mess. But as I drew closer, I became very aware that whatever the source of that light was, it was not from the water treatment plant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn fact, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure *what* it was. My first thought was that it was a fatberg (which is a solid mass of waste matter formed by an unholy mixture of wet wipes, grease, oil and every other piece of garbage people tend to flush down their toilets) but the longer I looked, the less certain I was about that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFatbergs usually didn\u2019t have lamps embedded in them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFatbergs usually didn\u2019t have thick spiderwebs clinging to them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFatbergs didn\u2019t usually lead into a separate tunnel into the earth large enough for me to walk through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd finally, fatbergs didn\u2019t usually have dead deer protruding from them. Let alone dead deer with other bugs *living in them*. God\u2026 the sight of those corpses\u2026 the way the bugs crawled through the rotting flesh and exposed bone. The empty, hollow eyes\u2026 it was almost too horrible to look at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I swore that I could see things *inside* the corpses! Honeycombs of some sort, and the bugs who crawled around them looked almost like bees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas\u2026 was something *cultivating some kind of bee in these things?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought back to Troy\u2019s rules.\n\n*\u201cRule 4: If you find a body\u2026 and odds are, you will find a body, don\u2019t touch it. Don\u2019t try to move it. Hell, don\u2019t even get close to it. And don\u2019t waste the supervisor's time reporting it. Only time the bodies get reported is when they\u2019re human.\u201d*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, they made a little more sense. If those spider things were cultivating something in these bodies\u2026 of course we shouldn\u2019t touch them. And if they were cultivating their food in the sewer\u2026 I paused, before staring down the tunnel that the corpses sat near the entrance of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDull lamps illuminated it as it wound down into the earth, and I could see several pale centipede things that looked a lot like the creature that Long had shot to get us into this mess in the first place. These things must have belonged to the Spiders too, although whether they were some sort of guard dog or another thing they were farming was hard to say.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took a step away from the tunnel, before looking back to make sure that I was well enough alone and trudging onward. And that was when I heard the slow rustle of movement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI paused, feeling a chill run through me as the imminent reality of my own death dawned on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSlowly I turned, just in time to see a dark shape descending from the ceiling. A fresh set of eyes settled on me, narrowing as they studied me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI put my hands up, hoping that it might understand the gesture of surrender and slowly it drew closer to me. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was curious, or looking to murder me and at that point, I don\u2019t think it really mattered. I wish I could say that I faced my death with dignity, but I\u2019m going to be honest, I didn\u2019t. I sat there, quivering and praying to whatever God would listen that it wouldn\u2019t, kill me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then\u2026 I heard a voice.\n\n\u201cLeave that one! He\u2019s with me!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTroy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw a figure emerge from the tunnel in the wall, and against all logic, *somehow* it was Troy! He had a hell of a goose egg on his head from where he\u2019d been hit earlier, but he was alive! He stepped between me and the spider person, arms outstretched.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWith me.\u201d He repeated firmly.\n\nThe Spider stared down at him, before huffing and turning away. I watched as they disappeared down the nearby tunnel, and Troy watched them go, before quietly turning to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cGood lord, boy\u2026 I\u2019m shocked to see you\u2019re still alive!\u201d\n\n\u201cW-what just happened?\u201d Was the only thing I could stammer. \u201cYou can talk to them?!\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of \u2018em. I\u2019ve been down here for long enough that they know me. Know I\u2019m not a threat. But they ain\u2019t too happy with us right now. So what you\u2019re gonna do here is get up, follow me, and I\u2019m gonna get you out of here.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know they\u2019re even gonna let us leave?\u201d I asked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTroy\u2019s expression soured.\n\n\u201cHad to pay \u2018em off\u2026\u201d He admitted, \u201cLet them keep what was left of your friend. They considered it a fair trade, so long as we leave. Now, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t ask any more questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter I made it out of the sewers that day, I ended up in the hospital alongside Peter.  I had some minor cuts and bruises, a burning rash over most of my body from all the sewage I\u2019d been crawling around in\u2026 but I was still alive, and I figured that had to count for something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNobody said a word about what happened to Stewart Long down in the sewer. He got written off as a workplace accident and they never even tried to recover his body. I suspect what\u2019s left of him is still down in the sewers, even now\u2026 feeding whatever it is that those things down there are cultivating, although I\u2019ve never seen the body myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes\u2026 I have been back down beneath the southeast side of town. The next time they needed someone to go, they sent me and Tomas along with Troy, Craig and Peter. We know what\u2019s down there and we know how to deal with them, after all. My second visit to those sewers was a lot less eventful, and most of my subsequent visits haven\u2019t been all that eventful either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve gotten better at dealing with the Spiders\u2026 they\u2019re not the most friendly folk and I know all too well that if you cross them, they\u2019ll rip your guts out before you even realize that you\u2019re dead. But so long as you follow the rules and leave them alone, they\u2019re content to live and let live. They can even be reasonable, to an extent. We\u2019ve had a few small incidents over the years, but nothing like the one that Long caused.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOdds are, when Troy and Craig retire next year, Tomas and I will be training the next group on what to do when you\u2019re down beneath the southeast side of town. So in preparation for that, I\u2019ve made a point to keep a copy of Tom's rules in the pumphouse. I also keep a picture of Stewart Long in there. Not as a memorial and not out of spite either. Just as a grim reminder of what can happen when you don\u2019t follow the \\[rules.\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)",

    "postText": "The first time I ever saw this man was the night of my brother's bachelor party. I had a few too many drinks so I took a cab home. I sat down on my couch and started watching some of the garbage that was on this late at night. I watched TV for an hour or so until I got bored. \r  \n\r  \nI was getting ready to go to sleep when I heard someone pounding on my door. I obviously got freaked out because it was the middle of the night. I slowly walked up to the door and looked through the eyehole. The only thing I could see was a silhouette of a hunched man standing in the corner of my driveway. At that point I was absolutely terrified. I thought about calling the police but I realized that I was probably just being stupid and that there was nothing to worry about. I turned on the porch light and the man started walking up to the door. He was around 6 '3, 6' 4, white, medium build and all of his clothes were torn, but the one thing that stood out for me was his eyes. They were bloodshot and looked like they were about to pop out of his head. \r  \n\r  \nWhen he walked up to the door he started looking at the eyehole.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cPlease let me in\u201d he said\r  \n\r  \nI was seconds away from calling the police when he said something that shook me to my core\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe thing that freaked me out the most about this sentence is that he said it in such a calm manner. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat do you want from me\u201d i said\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOpen the door\u201d he replied\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI didn\u2019t know what to say and just stared at the man. This went on for about a minute when he started sprinting to my backyard. I ran straight for my gun and grabbed my phone. I locked myself in my room upstairs and tried to call the police. I called 911 and they weren\u2019t answering. I called like 10 more times, and on my last try someone answered the phone.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\u201cPLEASE HELP ME, HE\u2019S GONNA KILL ME!!\u201d i screamed\r  \n\r  \nI couldn\u2019 hear anything and was about to hang up when I heard some say.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou can\u2019t hide from me\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI hung up after that.\r  \n\r  \nI decided that I was going to stay up all night just in case that freak makes it into my house.\r  \n\r  \nI fell asleep that night which was probably the most irresponsible thing I have ever done in my life. When I woke up I thought that this was probably just a horrible lucid dream or something like that.\r  \n\r  \nI put on some clothes and started heading downstairs to get some breakfast. I walked up to the kitchen and got some things out of my fridge. I walked up to my island near the window and looked up and something horrifying. It was that guy from last night, but this time he had blood smeared all over his face and clothes. I have never been so scared in my life. I must have stood there beside that window for like 4 hours when I decided that I was gonna shoot that asshole. I took my gun out of my room and walked outside to shoot it.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I walked out the first thing I noticed was the overwhelming stench of this guy. The smell was so horrible that i couldn't even breathe. I pointed my gun at him and said.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIf you don\u2019t leave right now im going to kill you\u201d\r  \n\r  \nHe smiled. He didn\u2019t care. I tried to pull the trigger put i couldn\u2019t, something was stopping me from doing so. Thats when i felt something controlling my hand, i couldnt resist it. My hand turned around and the gun was pointed in my face. I saw the trigger slowly get pulled, and then i just heard a click. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cShit, i must\u2019ve forgot to put the bullets in the magazine\u201d i thought\r  \n\r  \nI felt relieved but not for long. The man started whacking me with his gun and im pretty sure i passed out almost instantly.\r  \n\r  \nI woke up around in the middle of the night. Honestly i was surprised that the guy didn\u2019t kill me. I opened my eyes and couldn\u2019t see him anywhere. I felt a wave of relief fly through my body. I walked up to the door and reached for the door handle and noticed something horrifying. All of my fingers from my right hand were gone. I broke down and started weeping on the floor, I had no idea what i did to deserve this. \r  \n\r  \nI opened the door and walked in. It was pitch black so I turned on the light and I saw the man standing in the middle of my living room. I fell to the floor and accepted my fate. I layed on the floor for a good minute when I heard him giggle. I looked up and his face was and inch away from mine. The stench from his breath is something that i will never forget. I puched the freak in his face but he didn\u2019t even flinch. He didn\u2019t move staring at me. We sat there staring at each other for a long time. I started to stand up when i heard something fall in the kitchen. I saw a rotten leg covered in maggots. I looked back at the guy and he was gone. \r  \n\r  \nI ran up to the front door and tried to open it but it was locked and the keyhole was gone. I started walking up the stairs to get to my room because i had a baseball bat in there. The closer i got to the top of the stairs the louder i could hear the man laughing. When i got up to the top i could see his silhouette at the end of the hallway. My room was behind me so i slowly walked backwards to get in. The second i got in i slammed the door shut and locked it. \r  \n\r  \nI jumped out of the window and started running towards the nearest convenience store. I was getting close to it when i saw the guy again. I was sprinting away from him and towards the store but he was getting closer and closer. I was 10 feet from the store when he caught up with me. He tackled me to the ground and started smacking my skull against the concrete floor. Then he let my head go and i that it was over, but thats when he ripped off my entire leg. He didn\u2019t even break a sweat, it was easy for him. \r  \n\r  \nAfter that torture session he ran away. I started crawling towards the store. When i entered i couldn\u2019t see anything because of the bright lights. The only thing i could hear was the sound of people screaming. \r  \n\r  \nI woke up in a hospital in pain. A nurse walked up to me and asked me a few questions. After that i fell back asleep. When i woke up i decided to share this story. This is probably the not the last thing you will hear from me.",

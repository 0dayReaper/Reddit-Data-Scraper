    "postText": "I remember the first time I stepped into the lab; it was like stepping into the future. My name is Dr. Jennifer Collins, and I'm a genetic researcher at the most advanced laboratory on Earth. The lab, known simply as \"The Facility,\" is a sprawling underground complex hidden beneath a seemingly ordinary building in the heart of New York City. It's a place where scientists from all over the world work together to unlock the mysteries of the human genome.\r  \n\r  \nOur mission is simple: to understand the intricacies of human evolution and use that knowledge to improve the lives of people everywhere. But what I discovered in my research shook me to my core, and I can't keep it a secret any longer.\r  \n\r  \nI spent years poring over the countless human genome samples collected by our team. Each sample was like a puzzle piece, offering a glimpse into the complex tapestry of human evolution. But as I assembled the pieces, I began to notice a pattern that was both fascinating and terrifying.\r  \n\r  \nThe pattern I discovered was subtle, but unmistakable. Over the course of thousands of years, humans have been gradually losing their skin. I know it sounds impossible, but the evidence is right there in our DNA. And the most alarming part? Our research suggests that this process will accelerate dramatically in the next 50 years.\r  \n\r  \nAt first, I couldn't believe my own findings. I spent countless sleepless nights double and triple-checking my work, convinced that I must have made some mistake. But the more I studied, the more certain I became that my results were accurate. There was no denying it: humans are losing their skin, and there's nothing we can do to stop it.\r  \n\r  \nHow could this happen? The answer lies in the very building blocks of life: our genes. You see, over time, certain genes have evolved to become less active, while others have become more active. This process is known as genetic drift, and it's responsible for many of the traits that make us human. But it's also a double-edged sword, as it can lead to the gradual loss of crucial functions.\r  \n\r  \nIn the case of our skin, a complex interplay of genes is responsible for its structure and function. Over the millennia, however, these genes have been slowly mutating and degrading, causing our skin to become thinner and more fragile. This process has been so slow that it's gone largely unnoticed, but it's now reached a tipping point.\r  \n\r  \nOur research has revealed that a specific gene, which we've dubbed the \"Integumentary Collapse Trigger\" (ICT), is rapidly approaching a critical threshold. Once this threshold is crossed, the ICT gene will become so degraded that it will no longer be able to produce the proteins necessary for maintaining healthy skin.\r  \n\r  \nWithout these proteins, our skin will lose its ability to protect us from the elements, regulate our body temperature, and perform many of its other vital functions. In essence, we will become walking, breathing bags of muscle, bone, and organs, completely exposed to the harsh realities of the world.\r  \n\r  \nThe implications of this discovery are almost too terrible to contemplate. Without skin, humans will be far more susceptible to infections, injuries, and countless other health problems. Our quality of life will be drastically diminished, and our very survival as a species will be at risk.\r  \n\r  \nI've tried to share my findings with my colleagues at The Facility, but they've dismissed them as the ramblings of a madwoman. They say it's impossible, that I must have made a mistake in my calculations or misinterpreted the data somehow. But I know the truth. I've seen the future of humanity, and it's a future without skin.\r  \n\r  \nI knew I couldn't let this go. My conscience wouldn't allow it. If there was even a glimmer of hope that my findings could be used to avert this impending disaster, I had to pursue it. My research led me to a remote village in India, where rumors of a man with a mysterious genetic disorder had reached my ears. The disorder was said to be so severe that the man's skin was barely holding his organs in place, and he was being treated at a small, ill-equipped hospital in the village.\r  \n\r  \nI booked the next flight to India, filled with a sense of urgency and trepidation. As my plane touched down, I could feel the weight of the unknown bearing down on me. My journey through the bustling streets and crowded markets to the village was an arduous one, but I was driven by an unyielding determination to find this man and uncover the secrets of his condition.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I finally arrived at the village hospital, my heart sank. It was a dilapidated building that looked like it hadn't been updated in decades. The air inside was thick with the scent of sickness, a stifling atmosphere that seemed to choke the very life out of the place. I steeled myself and approached the nurse at the front desk, showing her the photograph of the man I was looking for. She led me down a dimly lit hallway, stopping at a door that creaked ominously as it opened.\r  \n\r  \nThere he was, lying on a stained and threadbare bed, his body a grotesque vision of suffering. His skin was a patchwork quilt of thin, translucent layers, held together by a series of crude, hastily applied bandages. It looked as if it might disintegrate at the slightest touch. His organs, barely contained within his fragile skin, pulsed and writhed like grotesque creatures trapped beneath a thin sheet of ice. The man's face was a twisted mask of agony, his eyes wide and unseeing, his mouth a silent scream.\r  \n\r  \nHe couldn't speak, but his pain was palpable, filling the small room like a tangible presence. I felt a sudden surge of nausea and had to steady myself against the wall. I knew I had to examine him, to find some clue about the genetic drift that was causing this horrific condition.\r  \n\r  \nWith gloves and a facemask, I carefully peeled back the bandages. I could see the dark, oozing lesions where his skin had split open, revealing the raw, exposed flesh beneath. It looked as if his body was being devoured from within, reduced to a quivering mass of tissue and bone. The sight was almost too much to bear, but I forced myself to continue.\r  \n\r  \nI took numerous samples and carefully documented the man's symptoms, my hands trembling as I worked. With each passing moment, the enormity of the situation weighed heavier on my heart. If I was right, and this was the future of humanity, then we were all condemned to a horrifying fate.\r  \n\r  \nAs I left the hospital, I felt a mixture of despair and determination. I knew that my work had only just begun, and that the road ahead would be fraught with challenges and heartache. But I couldn't turn back now. I owed it to this man, and to every person on Earth, to continue my research and find a way to stop the genetic drift that threatened to destroy us all.\r  \n\r  \nAs the plane ascended into the sky, my mind raced with the implications of what I had seen. I looked down at my hands, and my heart caught in my throat. There, on the back of my hand, were several small, dark spots. I felt a cold dread seep into my bones as I gently pressed a finger to one of the spots. It felt rough, like the texture of sandpaper.\r  \n\r  \nPanicking, I scratched at the spot, and to my horror, it began to peel back, revealing the raw, pink flesh underneath. The skin seemed to disintegrate beneath my touch, crumbling away like the fragile pages of an ancient book. Tears filled my eyes as I realized the terrible truth: the genetic drift had already begun, and there was no turning back.\r  \n\r  \nMy journey had started as a desperate attempt to save humanity from a skinless future, but now, it seemed, there would be no escape from the nightmare that awaited us all. As the plane soared high above the clouds, I couldn't help but wonder if this was the beginning of the end, and if there was any hope left for the human race. \r  \n\r  \nI am writing this down as fast as I can. I hope no one can see me cry.",

Or is the implication here that all living humans are going to have their skin slough off randomly?",

So you actually believe that in a world with global warming and thinning ozone, we\u2019re going to get thinner skin instead of skin with more melanin? \n\nHow did you predict your 50 years? 50 years is too short a time for complex organisms to evolve or devolve. 50 years in the evolution timeframe is like less than a nanosecond in evolution timeframe. \nYour (abdominal) organs are encased by peritoneum and help in place with muscles. So your organs won\u2019t be bulging out because you have no skin. \n\nAnd btw, our skin\u2019s biggest function is thermoregulation and being barrier to external aggressors such as sunlight, heat, microorganisms etc. if we don\u2019t have skin, we won\u2019t live long enough to see the end of our civilisation. We\u2019d just die out super fast just by being unable to regulate our body temperature. No skin, means no sweat, and no sweat means our bodies are going to heat up pretty fast. Our brains would go into seizure from the over heating. A baby born without skin won\u2019t even live long enough for a day or two, let alone growing up to procreate.\n\nAnd that man in India should be dead seeing the dirty sheet he\u2019s lying on, so what magic is keeping him alive? Powerful antibiotics? Seriously, where did you get your degree from?",

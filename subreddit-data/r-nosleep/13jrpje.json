    "postText": "\u201c*What the fuck is wrong with you Brittany? I thought we were friends?\u201d*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was the voicemail that I woke up to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\u201cYou\u2019re fucking sick, okay?* ***Fucking sick!*** *I don\u2019t know what the hell your problem is, or what\u2019s going on with you and I don\u2019t want to know! Fuck you, you sick, homewrecking whore!\u201d*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe recording ended, and I sat on the side of my bed, wondering what the hell had just happened! When I\u2019d gone to bed, Michelle and I had been friends! I\u2019d gone out to dinner with her and her boyfriend, Rick just a few days ago and everything had been fine then! I didn\u2019t know what had changed!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried calling her back, of course but I couldn\u2019t get through. She\u2019d probably blocked my number. She certainly seemed to have me blocked on every other kind of social media! Facebook, Instagram, Twitter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019d messaged a few of our mutual friends, but most of them either didn\u2019t respond to me or had blocked me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat the hell had just happened? What the hell had I done? Why were people suddenly refusing to even talk to me? It didn\u2019t make any sense!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2018*Fuck you, you sick, homewrecking whore!\u2019*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHomewrecking? Did Michelle think that I\u2019d done something with Rick? She couldn\u2019t possibly believe that, could she? I wasn\u2019t exactly open about how much I hated Rick\u2026 but it wasn\u2019t much of a secret either. I\u2019d always known that Michelle could do better than him. I mean seriously, she worked as a paralegal. He worked for some no name mobile game developer that published the kinds of disgusting low brow \u2018games\u2019 you see advertised all over the internet. He was 27 and looked 45, had a forehead that took up most of his face and overly red skin that looked to be covered in grease. You couldn\u2019t have a conversation with the man without him either talking about his NFTs or pushing whatever crap game his company had recently launched (such gems such as \u2018*Fart Cloud Massacre*\u2019 and something called *\u2018Love Match\u2019* that advertised itself as some puzzle/makeover game but was ***literally just Bejeweled with a different fucking color scheme!***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had literally no idea why Michelle ever bothered with him and I had no idea why she seemed to think I\u2019d done anything with him!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut\u2026 since nobody else seemed to want to give me any answers as to what the hell had just happened, Rick was starting to look like the best person to contact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I\u2019d supposedly done something with him, then maybe he\u2019d known what it was. So I bit the bullet, swallowed my pride, and sent him a message on Facebook.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\u2018Hey, what happened between you and Michelle? She\u2019s pissed at me! What did I do?\u2019*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsurprisingly, it didn\u2019t take him all that long to respond.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\u2018Hey Brittany! Sorry about that\u2026 she\u2019s pissed because she found some of your videos on my laptop. Shouldn\u2019t have let her borrow it! Love your stuff, though\u2026\u2019*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy videos?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat the hell was he talking about? My mind immediately went to something that I might have filmed with Michelle at some point? Our high school graduation maybe? There weren\u2019t a lot of videos of me out there. I\u2019ve never really liked being on camera. Why would Rick even have videos of me on his computer anyways, and why would Michelle be mad at *me* about it? Maybe this was a case of mistaken identity? Although how many other Brittanys could she possibly know?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I sat in bed, mulling all of this over and still trying to wake up, I got another message from Rick.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\u2018Hey, since we\u2019re talking\u2026 I wanted to know if you did custom requests! I was looking for some more specialized fetish content. Like\u2026 I wanted to purchase a video of you pooping, but like\u2026 more. Doing stuff with it. Would you be open to that?\u2019*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stared at the screen, reading over the words that Rick had just sent me and trying to make sense of them. For a moment, it was almost like I was reading something in another language entirely. I hadn\u2019t had my coffee yet, so I wasn\u2019t entirely awake and my brain was not working at full capacity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCustom requests\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*A video of me pooping\u2026*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\u2018More\u2026\u2019***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSlowly every little bit of the meaning behind the message I\u2019d just read slowly clicked into place and as I read it again and again, I was forced to accept that I had in fact read, what I\u2019d just read.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***What the actual fuck?***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\u2018EXCUSE ME?\u2019* I messaged back, and I really don\u2019t think that those two words fully encapsulated the barrage of complicated emotions that his message had incited in me.\n\n*\u2018It\u2019s cool if you don\u2019t!\u2019* Rick said, *\u2018I know you don\u2019t really interact with fans but like\u2026 I like your stuff. It\u2019s kinda intimate, you know?\u2019*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo! No, I didn\u2019t know!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\u2018What videos?!\u2019* I demanded, before shaking my head and just pulling him into a call.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRick took a while to answer and for a moment, I was almost afraid that he wasn\u2019t going to. But after a few minutes, I heard him pick up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWhat videos?\u201d I asked. \u201cRick, what the *fuck* are you talking about? Is this some kind of fucking joke?\u201d\n\n\u201cN-no!\u201d He said, \u201cI swear it\u2019s not! I thought\u2026 the videos, on YourBrittany! That\u2019s what I was talking about!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is YourBrittany?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 you know, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d His voice was faltering, as if he was slowly piecing something together. He trailed off, going silent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cRick?\u201d I asked, \u201cRick, what the hell is YourBrittany?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t answer, not at first and his silence just made me all the more uneasy.\n\n\u201cCan we meet?\u201d He asked. His voice sounded a little different than before. Smaller, almost shaken. It did absolutely nothing to put me at ease.\n\n\u201cI-I swear to God it\u2019s not for anything weird! I swear to fucking God! But\u2026 shit\u2026 shit\u2026 shit\u2026 I think you need to see this\u2026\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could feel my heart beating faster and faster in my chest.\n\n\u201cSee what?\u201d I asked, already dreading the answer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHalf an hour later, I was pulling into Rick and Michelle\u2019s driveway. She wasn\u2019t home, and I wasn\u2019t particularly thrilled by the prospect of showing up at their house while she was away after she\u2019d accused me of having some kind of fling with her boyfriend, but he\u2019d insisted that I go there and I didn\u2019t have a whole lot of other options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a can of pepper spray in my apartment, just in case this somehow went south and when I went to knock on the door, I found it unlocked. Rick was in the kitchen with his laptop, looking a hell of a lot paler than usual, and when he saw me, his grave expression didn\u2019t do much to calm my nerves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cRick, what the hell is going on?\u201d I asked. I wasn\u2019t really in the mood for formalities at the moment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s better if you see for yourself\u2026\u201d He said quietly, before turning the laptop to face me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was greeted by a website with my face all over it. Photographs of me that I\u2019d taken in various places. Most of them had probably been ripped right off of social media. At the top of the website was a header that read:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Welcome to YourBrittany! The object of your secret admiration!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck\u2026?\u201d I said under my breath as I scrolled through the site. On the left side was a short blurb that I read through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\u2018Hi! My name is Brittany Murphy and I love the feeling of being watched! So here at YourBrittany, I want to share all of my private moments with you! With a membership, you can watch me anywhere, anytime doing anything and you can purchase my highlight videos to enjoy at your leisure! Nothing is off limits, I\u2019m your naughty domestic girl and I\u2019m ready to put on a show for you!\u2019*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d I asked as I scrolled through some of the highlight videos that were available. Just the names of them turned my stomach\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Shower fun!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Shitting in the morning!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Private time with my vibe &lt;3*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Shower pee!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Bedtime for Brittany!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thumbnails all displayed different vantage points from inside my house. My bedroom, my shower\u2026 from inside of my fucking toilet! I looked over at Rick in disbelief. He couldn\u2019t even make eye contact with me. Up until recently, I didn\u2019t think that this guy was capable of shame but he was proving me very, very wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I found it a while ago\u2026\u201d He stammered, \u201cI saw one of your videos on a site I like and I\u2026 I didn\u2019t know! I thought you were making this!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou thought I was making *this?*\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got your name and face all over it! It says it\u2019s you! Yeah, I thought you were making it!\u201d He said. \u201cI figured it was like an OnlyFans or something\u2026 I mean, the money had to be good!\u201d He said, \u201cThe subscription isn\u2019t exactly cheap!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cSo you thought I put *a camera in my toilet* for money?\u201d I asked, in complete and utter disbelief.\n\n\u201cLook, there\u2019s good money in weird porn,\u201d He said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not exactly in a position to fucking judge, am I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou knew about this and you never said anything to me?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything to Michelle?!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow exactly was I supposed to tell either of you that I found your secret porn site!\u201d He asked. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not exactly *normal* porn! I didn\u2019t want to call you out!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just shook my head and tried to move on from the subject.\n\n\u201cHow long has this site been active?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cAbout a year,\u201d He said. \u201cI\u2019ve only known about it for a few months though.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI scrolled a little further before I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. With trembling hands, I closed the laptop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA year\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA whole year of my life, broadcast to strangers as\u2026 as fucking porn\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI kept trying to wrap my mind around it. Kept trying to make sense of it. Part of me wanted to break down laughing at the sheer *stupidity* of this entire situation. Part of me felt eyes on me at that very moment. My skin felt like it was crawling. I felt like I wanted to bury myself in a little hole and just stop existing. Who else in my life knew about this? Who else did I know who\u2019d been watching me in the shower? Watching me in the bathroom? Watching me sleep?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow many people had been watching?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow many people had recognized me? How many people had tried to find me?\n\n\u201cBrittany?\u201d Rick asked, although I barely heard him. My breathing was getting heavier. My chest felt tight as if something was crushing me. I could feel myself starting to cry. Rick just sat quietly beside me, unsure what to say for a while before finally choosing something to say.\n\n\u201cWe should call the police\u2026\u201d He said. \u201cYou\u2019re renting, right? You should give them the name of your landlord\u2026 maybe he\u2019s the one who\u2026\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy landlord?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt a fresh stab of panic in my chest. My landlords were a middle aged couple who lived across town. I\u2019d been renting from them for about three years and I couldn\u2019t imagine them having set any of this up although who else would have had access to the house?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter another moment of hesitation, Rick got up. He took out his phone, but I stopped him.\n\n\u201cN-no\u2026 don\u2019t call\u2026\u201d I said, \u201cI want to go there in person.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe paused, before nodding. I think he could see in my eyes just how scared I was in that moment. Just how *violated* I felt. And even though in a sense, he\u2019d been one of those violators, in that moment he felt like the only person I could trust. I still hated him. But he at least seemed to understand the horror that I felt and I wondered if he shared it in his own way. I believed him when he said he\u2019d only\u2026 indulged in those videos when he\u2019d thought that I\u2019d been the one producing them. At least in the scenario, he envisioned, there as some measure of consent there. Some belief that I\u2019d *chosen* to share those videos as opposed to having the choice made for me.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the police then,\u201d He said, before picking up his laptop and getting ready to leave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe didn\u2019t speak during the entire ride over to the police station.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t actually remember much of the ride over. I just kept thinking about my house, trying to imagine where the cameras might have been. I would have thought I\u2019d have noticed some hidden cameras! I would have thought I\u2019d have seen them at some point! Wouldn\u2019t I have seen them?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the station, Rick showed the police the website and I gave my statement. I don\u2019t know what I expected them to do\u2026 I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d hoped for them to do. Time passed by in a blur, and I don\u2019t remember most of what happened at the police station. For the most part, it\u2019s because I stayed in one of their interview rooms, sitting quietly and waiting for time to pass. The Police had said they\u2019d send some officers to my home, although while those officers were doing their investigation, there wasn\u2019t much for me to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRick had stayed with me for the first hour or so, although he\u2019d left when it was time for work. He\u2019d offered to stay longer, but I\u2019d told him that it was fine. A couple of hours later, a Detective walked into the room with me, a fairly grave expression on his face. I could see the collection of wires in his hand, along with the small camera hanging off the end. It had been painted to match the wall. It would have been easy to miss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe spoke to me like a friend, making small talk and introducing himself but most of it just went in one ear and out the other. Just because he spoke like nothing was wrong, didn\u2019t mean that nothing was wrong. My eyes remained fixated on that camera he\u2019d set on the table in front of me, and the longer I stared at it the deeper the dread in my chest seemed to sink.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cThis was one of the ones from your bedroom,\u201d He said, as he noticed me staring down at the camera. \u201cWe found others in the bathroom, kitchen, living room\u2026 just about every other room in the house. We\u2019ve still got a couple of officers there looking to make sure we got them all.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stared down at the camera, feeling hollow inside and unsure what to even say. The blank lens looked right at me, and even though the camera should have been off, I still felt watched.\n\n\u201cT-take it away, please\u2026\u201d I said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Detective just gave a curt nod, before pushing it off to the side. He was kind enough to move the lens so that it wasn\u2019t looking at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spoken to the owners of the property and we\u2019ll be questioning them shortly,\u201d He said. \u201cWe\u2019re also looking into our options regarding taking the website and the video content down, although I can\u2019t promise you any immediate or lasting results here. We don\u2019t have any way to gauge how often these videos have been downloaded or where else they may have been uploaded.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked up at him, a fresh wave of horror washing over me.\n\n\u201cIt could have been uploaded elsewhere?\u201d I asked, my voice quaking a little bit.\n\n\u201cYour friend, Rick Wilson. He indicated that he\u2019d first discovered the content on another website when we spoke to him. We asked him to provide the relevant links so that you can contact those websites to request a takedown.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could feel my entire body trembling again. My chest felt tight. Breathing felt difficult I felt myself finally starting to fully breakdown. The panic attack hit me like a train and there was nothing that I could do to stop it as I started to cry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to sleep in a hotel that night, although really I only barely slept at all. I kept getting up to inspect the corners of the rooms and check the bathroom up and down. I didn\u2019t find any cameras\u2026 but I hadn\u2019t found them before, why would I start finding them now?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the next few days, the police cleared my landlords of any charges. They determined that they weren\u2019t the ones who\u2019d installed the cameras, although that wasn\u2019t much of a comfort to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told them I wasn\u2019t going back to the house and they let me out of my lease without argument. Not even a week later, the house was for sale.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYourBrittany was taken down the day after I\u2019d talked to Rick, although I know that it wasn\u2019t the Police who did it. Without its star, the show couldn\u2019t go on. Again, that wasn\u2019t much of a comfort to me. My life was already ruined. There was no going back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ve moved out of the state and started a new life. I\u2019ve changed my name, shaved my hair, gotten some tattoos. Anything I can do to make myself unrecognizable. But it isn\u2019t enough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still look for the cameras everywhere I go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to find another video of me online.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve hired you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey say that you\u2019re the best\u2026 they say that you can do anything. *Anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s been a few years since YourBrittany went down, but I guess if anyone could find out who put it up, it\u2019s you. I\u2019ve saved up every penny I have and it\u2019s all yours. All of it. I just want to know it\u2019s over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just want to know that whoever did this to me is dead and I don\u2019t care how they die. Do it however you want.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just want to feel safe [again.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre)",

            "comment": "This is absolutely TERRIFYING!\n\nProbably because I've been in a somewhat similar place/situation. \n\nI was staying with someone temporarily once when, after a few weeks, I found a camera. In the bathroom. Aimed directly at the toilet.\n\nAnd then I found another one in the room where I was sleeping. Aimed at the bed.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 had been over the night before. \n\nThe guy wasn't JUST watching me sleep. \n\nHe was trying to watch my fianc\u00e9 and I have sex.\n\nI called the police, and, with no qualms or hesitation, the guy admitted to what he had done. I think he thought that since it was *his* house (it was actually just the lower half of a house that he was renting), and I was just a guest, that he had the RIGHT to record me. Except it wasn't in public areas, OR for the purposes of ensuring his safety, or the safety of his belongings (he had nothing TO steal, even if I WANTED to).\n\nHe was arrested and taken to jail.\n\n\n\nAnd then he was released the next afternoon. \n\nThe DA declined to prosecute, even though they had the cameras AND the memory cards.\n\n\nThis was four years ago. I have blocked the majority of that time period out. (This is the first time that I've said anything about it, except to tell my therapist - but I wouldn't DISCUSS it - and my fianc\u00e9 has brought it up once or twice.) And I get anxious and uncomfortable whenever I'm within a few blocks of that house. \n\nIt still has ME all kinds of fucked up, four years later. And HE didn't even get a TICKET!!! \ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\n\n\n\nSo, once I figured out what was happening, I didn't exactly WANT to read the rest of the story, KNOWING that it meant bringing back a lot of memories and feelings that  were only going to fuck me up. BUT, I also knew that if I DIDN'T read the ENTIRE thing, then it was going to be EVEN WORSE.",

Since you kept making her see the issues with your hatred of him, she partially resented you and set up the cameras sometime when she was in your place. She likely posted some of the stuff on a site she knew Rick visited and steered him toward the YourBrittany site she made. After waiting for a time when she was comfortable ditching you both, she \"found\" the stuff on Rick's computer and set off the events described by fighting with Rick and calling you. Rick likely mentioned to her after your visit that you had no idea about the site and had gone to the police, causing her to shut it down before she got caught.\n\nMaybe if you have something you know that she touched, you can try and have the item she touched as well as the collected evidence (the spy cameras) tested for prints.",

Stolen account is still active on IG. Then a few weeks ago my HUSBAND got a friend request from\u2026 me. I guess I do adult content apparently lol. This time only some goofy selfies were stolen but what the hell. I can\u2019t imagine how you feel OP I hope enough time goes by to start feeling safe again.",

The cops/feds can get the registrant's info from there\n\nThere's also the eCommerce portion. If this person was selling videos, that money has to go somewhere. The bank would point you to where the money goes, and that eCommerce business would be able to cross-reference that to find the owner of the account.\n\nIt's virtually impossible to run a website anonymously, so it shouldn't be *too* hard for them to nail this person to a cross.

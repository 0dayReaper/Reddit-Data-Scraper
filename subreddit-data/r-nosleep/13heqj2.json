    "postText": "I've been living in this house for about 10 years now, and I've always felt like I was being watched. I've never seen anything, but I can just feel it. It's like there's someone out there, in the woods, just waiting for me to make a mistake.\r  \n\r  \nIt started a few months ago. I was walking home from work late one night, and I saw a figure standing in the shadows of the trees. I couldn't make out any details, but I could tell it was a man. He just stood there, watching me, as I walked by.\r  \n\r  \nI tried to forget about it, but I couldn't. I started having nightmares about the man in the woods. In my dreams, he would chase me through the trees, his face hidden in the shadows. I would always wake up before he caught me, but I could still feel his breath on my neck.\r  \n\r  \nI started to avoid going outside at night. I would stay inside and watch TV, or read a book, anything to keep my mind off of the man in the woods. But I knew he was still out there, waiting for me.\r  \n\r  \nOne night, I couldn't sleep. I was tossing and turning in bed, trying to get comfortable. I finally gave up and got out of bed. I went to the kitchen to get a glass of water.\r  \n\r  \nAs I was standing in the kitchen, I heard a noise outside. I went to the window and looked out. I couldn't see anything, but I could hear the sound of someone moving through the trees.\r  \n\r  \nI froze. I didn't know what to do. I wanted to call the police, but I was afraid that if I made a sound, the man would hear me.\r  \n\r  \nI stood there for a few minutes, just listening. The sound of movement in the trees stopped. I waited a few more minutes, and then I went back to bed.\r  \n\r  \nI didn't sleep well that night. I kept thinking about the man in the woods. I was afraid that he was going to come for me.\r  \n\r  \nThe next day, I went to the police. I told them about the man in the woods, but they didn't believe me. They said that there was no one in the woods, and that I was just imagining things.\r  \n\r  \nI know what I saw, and I know what I heard. I'm not crazy. The man in the woods is real, and he's out there, waiting for me.\r  \n\r  \nI don't know what to do. I'm afraid to go outside, and I'm afraid to stay inside. I'm afraid for my life.\r  \n\r  \nI decided to set a trap for the man in the woods. I went to the hardware store and bought a motion sensor light and a camera. I set up the light and camera in the woods behind my house.\r  \n\r  \nThat night, I waited. I sat in my living room, watching TV, and waiting for the motion sensor light to go off.\r  \n\r  \nAbout an hour after I went to bed, the motion sensor light went off. I jumped up and ran to the window. I looked out, and I saw the man in the woods. He was standing in the light, looking at my house.\r  \n\r  \nI took a picture of the man with my phone. I then called the police and told them what I had seen.\r  \n\r  \nThe police came and took the picture. They said that they would investigate, but I haven't heard anything from them since.\r  \n\r  \nI'm still afraid. I don't know if the man in the woods is still out there, but I'm not taking any chances. I've bought a gun, and I'm not afraid to use it.\r  \n\r  \nI'm just trying to live my life, but I know that the man in the woods is out there, somewhere. And I know that he's watching me.",

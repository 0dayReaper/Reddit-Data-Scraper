The engine roared as we sped away from the butcher shop.  Randy was sitting in the seat next to me and it took me a minute to realize he was eating something.  \n\nIt was a bucket of KFC.  \n\n\"Seriously!?  How can you be hungry at a time like this??  We're about to die, Randy!\"\n\n\"We got bigger problems than that right now,\" he said, patting down his pockets with greasy fingers and leaving stains as he searched for something.  \"We're all out of booze!  We need to make a pit stop as soon as you get a chance.\"\n\nNormally this would be an absurd statement.  But unfortunately the lack of alcohol was a bit of an issue, since there were plenty more monsters ready to come through into our world, and the only thing keeping them out was our ability to stay intoxicated so we didn\u2019t see them.  I had kept my percentage down below the legal driving limit, but I was starting to feel like that wasn't cutting it anymore.\n\n\"You need to start drinking more,\" Randy explained.  \"You're the one who saw it first, remember?  If anything, this is kinda your fault.\"\n\nI gripped the steering wheel with white knuckled rage and continued driving.  \n\nRegardless of what he said, I want to make sure it's on the record that this was all Randy's fault.  He had admitted to making at least one wish using a cursed magic monkey paw - and we all know how that usually plays out.\n\nI saw a convenience store and immediately slammed on the brakes.  Reaching over Randy, I threw open his door and kicked him out.  It was easy since he wasn't wearing a seatbelt and was already beginning to fall asleep.\n\n\"What the fuck, dude?\" He yelled as I pulled away.\n\n\"Get us more booze!  I'm gonna circle the block,\" I shouted at him out the window, picking up speed.\n\nThen I took out my gun and aimed at the monster which was getting closer by the second.  I took three shots at it over my shoulder and missed two of them.  But the third caught it squarely in the neck and it began to howl a guttural cry, dripping black blood all over the street from its fresh wound.  It slowed down momentarily, but then picked up its pace again, coming after me with renewed rage.\n\nMy goal had been accomplished, though.  I\u2019d been trying to keep it away from Randy, since he was on foot and more vulnerable.  We would need to abandon the car, though, I realized.  If I was going to start drinking more I wouldn\u2019t be able to drive safely.  As bad as things were getting, I wasn\u2019t about to start breaking the law - especially that particular one.  I\u2019d seen enough death and destruction caused by drunk drivers over my years on the force.  I wasn\u2019t going to go down that road.  \n\nI looked back to see the creature still gaining on me.  \n\nMy mind was racing trying to think of a way to evade it, to outwit it.  I needed to do something to kill it.  But what?\n\nSuddenly my cell phone was ringing.  I picked it up and looked at the caller ID.  It was Jay, the delivery driver.  He was in the car ahead of me and I had kind of forgotten he was there.  \n\n\u201cListen,\u201d he said quickly.  \u201cI got a plan.  We need to lure that thing to the swamp.  Just follow me and keep up the pace.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cop car,\u201d I said dryly.  \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I can keep up with your piece of shit-\u201d\n\nMy words were cut short as the line went dead and the car ahead of me began to accelerate rapidly.  I floored it but found the guy was still gaining distance between the two of us.  \n\nWhatever he had under the hood was making that little car go a lot faster than I would have thought possible. \n\nMy phone dinged and I looked down to see a text from Jay.  It was an eggplant with a water spray emoji.  \n\nThis fucking town\u2026\n\n*\n\nWe reached the edge of the city limits of Hollow\u2019s End to find a parking lot which sloped at an unnatural angle downwards.  At the bottom of this strange gravel lot was a murky-looking swamp full of brackish green water.  A small copse of trees stood to one side near the shore. \n\nNo other cars were parked there which was good, since the creature was still close behind us.  \n\nI was following Jay as closely as I could and imitating his car\u2019s movements, although my vehicle was sluggish and clumsy by comparison.  He was still driving at top speed, and I figured it was important that I keep up with him for whatever he planned to do.  \n\nWhen we reached the edge of the water, near that little grouping of trees, he hit the brakes and swerved to the right.  His tires stayed on the gravel, but just barely.  The entire parking lot was sloped so severely towards the water that the force of gravity was insisting on taking us into the swamp.  \n\nRealizing that my bigger vehicle wouldn\u2019t make the turn in time, I hit the brakes early and tried to slow down, knowing that otherwise I would crash right into a tree or go into the water trying to make the move.  \n\nAs soon as I slowed down I could hear the creature\u2019s breath and its movements just behind the car.  I avoided the temptation to look back, since I knew it would be my death if I did.  Instead, I yanked hard on the wheel and turned it to the right, skidding to a stop on the grass, my fender just inches away from a large pine tree.  \n\nThe creature\u2019s brakes were not quite as good as mine, since it was desperate to kill me and hadn\u2019t really slowed down.  Instead, it went skidding into the green water, coated with algae and looking much thicker than was normal.  It was like a giant bowl of pea soup.  The creature was thrashing around, looking as if it were in pain, and then I noticed the tendrils of swamp water moving on its skin, pulling it in deeper, like an enormous squid wrestling with a shark.\n\nMy phone rang again and I picked it up, my eyes still focused on the creature trying to get out of the swamp.  It looked like it would not be able to escape from whatever was holding it there, and I breathed a sigh of relief that I hadn\u2019t gone in with that wild last minute maneuver.  \n\nThen it was as if an enormous hand reached up from below and pulled the creature under.  Despite the fact that there were only dark empty sockets where eyes should have been, I could have sworn I saw them widen as it was dragged under, and then was gone. \n\n\u201cProblem solved,\u201d Jay said when I answered the phone.  \u201cYou can thank me later.  And we\u2019ll definitely owe Swampy a favor.  Now let\u2019s get back into town and grab Randy.  Maybe the three of us can figure out a solution to this whole mess.\u201d\n\n*\n\nI managed to convince Jay to let me ride shotgun in his car, telling him that mine was having engine trouble.  This was partly as a ploy to make him our designated driver, but also to cover for the fact that he was clearly the superior driver of a far better automobile than my cruiser.  And who knew when we\u2019d have to outrun one of those monsters again?\n\nAfter applying copious amounts of duct tape to all of the mirrors on the vehicle, we were off, heading back towards the convenience store where I\u2019d left Randy.  \n\nWe found him out front with a large paper bag full of bottles in his arms, sleeping in the grassy ditch near the road.  There were several children taking turns at poking him with a stick.\n\n\u201cOkay, beat it, kids!\u201d I yelled at them as we approached. \n\nThe children ran off and out of the corner of my eye I noticed a few of them looked very odd.  One had a furry face and ears like a dog, while another had red eyes, and yet another was running on all fours.  They scattered in every direction, making it difficult to pinpoint any other discrepancies.  \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with this town?\u201d I muttered to nobody in particular.  \n\n\u201cHow much time do you have?\u201d Jay asked, laughing.  \u201cThis place is weirder than you could possibly imagine.  There\u2019s a lot of history here.  Sorry to say, you didn\u2019t really know what you were getting into when you moved to this place.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you give me a quick summary?\u201d I asked, kicking Randy gently in the ribs.  He snored and swatted the air like an annoyed cat, then rolled over on his other side.  His right leg began to pump up and down as if he were chasing a rabbit in his dreams.  \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really at liberty to discuss all of it.  People in Hollow\u2019s End prefer to keep their secrets to themselves.  But if you get to know them, you\u2019ll find most folks are nice enough.  As long as you live here, anyways.  Tourists do tend to occasionally go missing if they stay out past sunrise.  And if you meet anyone wearing a hooded robe your best bet is to avoid them.  Oh, and there\u2019s this guy named Frank who-\u201d\n\nRandy sat bolt upright, screaming at the top of his lungs, clutching the bag of liquor bottles so tightly against his chest that I thought they would shatter.  \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, man,\u201d I said, leaning down to pat his shoulder in what I hoped was a comforting gesture.  \u201cIt was just a nightmare.\u201d\n\nHe was breathing heavily for a few moments and didn\u2019t respond.  But then finally he unscrewed the cap of one of the liquor bottles and took a long gulp.  \n\n\u201cRight.  A nightmare.  That\u2019s all it was.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t seem entirely convinced.  \n\n\u201cAlright, what\u2019s the plan, guys?\u201d Jay asked.  \u201cI\u2019m happy to help out if you need me to.\u201d\n\nI took one of the liquor bottles from Randy and took a long drink from it.  After wiping my mouth, I screwed the cap back on and stuffed the bottle in my pocket.  Thinking hard about the next lead to follow up on, I came up short.  We didn\u2019t really have anything.  \n\n\u201cDo you know anyone who would be interested in buying a monkey paw?\u201d I asked.  \u201cIs there anyone in town dumb enough or reckless enough to take ownership of it?  Because I feel like that fucking thing is at the center of all of this.  It\u2019s like a murder investigation - if we can find the weapon used to commit the crime, we might be able to solve it.\u201d  \n\nJay looked at me and Randy looked at the ground between his legs.  \n\n\u201cI know just the guy,\u201d Jay answered.  \u201cYou know how I was telling you to stay away from Frank?  Well, we might need to disregard that advice, just temporarily.\u201d\n\n*\n\nThe three of us pulled up outside a house a short while later, now with Jay behind the wheel, chauffeuring us around town.  \n\nWe went up to the front door and he continued explaining the protocol for how to deal with this Frank individual.  \n\n\u201cRemember, whatever you do, don\u2019t stare.  And don\u2019t go inside his house - whatever he wants to tell us he can tell us outside.  People who go in there are usually tourists, and they\u2019re never, ever seen again.  That\u2019s like guaranteed death just stepping into that place.\u201d\n\nI tried not to think about how many rules I was breaking, how many vows in my oath as a Sheriff were completely null and void now.  \n\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m a police officer, right?  Most people don\u2019t speak so freely about the kidnapping and murder of tourists.\u201d\n\nRandy slapped my arm.  \n\n\u201cCome on, man.  Just when we\u2019re starting to think you\u2019re cool, you go and say something like that.  Killing tourists is a proud tradition in Hollow\u2019s End.  If you don\u2019t like it then you shouldn\u2019t have moved here.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t have time to debate the subject anymore, as Jay was now knocking on the front door of the house.  \n\nThe door swung open on the first knock, as if it had been slightly ajar.  \n\n\u201cHello,\u201d Jay called into the darkness.  \u201cFrank?  Are you there?  I need to talk to you about something.\u201d\n\nHe stuck his head into the dark gap afforded by the open door.  For a moment I had a horrible mental image of it slamming shut on his neck, squeezing and choking him as blood poured from wounds created by the pressure of sharp wood on his flesh.  \n\nBut instead, something worse happened.\n\nJay let out a gasp and then disappeared through the gap.  As if he had been picked up by his hair and was dragged inside by a hungry bear.  \n\nMy heart was pounding fast as I realized I was going to have to ignore all of Jay's warnings if I was going to save him and the town.  Despite the dangers, we were going to have to go inside after [all.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JGcreepypastas/comments/13t7ywp/theres_a_new_sheriff_in_hollows_end_cake_day/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[YT](https://youtube.com/@JordanGrupe)\n\n[TCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)",

    "postText": "[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13fgvbk/i_was_born_and_raised_in_a_cult_when_i_escaped_i/)\n\n\\-\n\nWe had breakfast at the rocks. The gruel was an appropriate consistency for Luna; she didn\u2019t have to chew as much, and thus could eat it relatively painlessly. The bread was a bit more troublesome, though, so she offered it to me. I humbly accepted, and although I felt bad for eating her food, it was an even worse crime to leave anything uneaten. \r  \n\r  \nI didn\u2019t want to stare, but it was hard not to. Her face looked surprisingly good, all things considered. Some of the bruises were already fading away, and the wound on her forehead was barely visible. I could almost see her face healing, like it was getting better by the minute, but that didn\u2019t seem possible. Maybe the wounds had looked worse in the faint light of the oil lamp - or maybe it simply hadn\u2019t been as bad as I had thought. \r  \n\r  \nAfter lunch, Luna told me that she wanted to show me something. We went around the hill containing the elders\u2019 complex of buildings. I followed her up the rocky side of the hill, and we stopped at a large rock, which rested deep in the face of the wall. It was miraculously flat, like someone had carved it out, making it the perfect place to sit. Luna sat down and leaned against the wall, closing her eyes to let the sun cover every inch of her body. I followed suit. \r  \n\r  \nSomething about the position of the rock relative to everything else made that spot quieter than anywhere else, and it was just high enough that no one below could see us - or from above, either - unless they were really looking. It was just the two of us, not simply in body but in spirit, and without me even noticing, we began to hold hands. We didn\u2019t talk for a while. The sun was warm, and I could hear Luna\u2019s soft breathing, interjoining with the faint echoes of birdsong emanating from the surrounding forest. I could\u2019ve stayed there for the rest of eternity, and I wanted to tell that to Luna, but I didn\u2019t dare to. \r  \n\r  \nThe quiet was shattered by a blaring, metallic voice coming from above us. It jolted me away from my daydreams - of *Luna* \\- and made my bones feel cold.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThe ritual will commence in two days. True Love will finally bear its fruits, my brothers, my sisters, *our children*! Please make any and all necessary preparations. May the One True God bless us all!\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cTwo days?\u201d I asked Luna, my thoughts immediately scattered. She was staring into nothingness, enveloped in thought. I noticed I had let go of her hand, which now felt empty. When did I let go, or did she?\r  \n\r  \nAfter a pause, she finally looked at me and said \u201cYeah, I guess it is.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWhen John had talked to me about the ritual earlier, I\u2019d thought it\u2019d maybe be months, even years away. Two days was barely enough time to scrounge up a good plan; I had planned my escape for two years. Why hadn\u2019t Luna told me this? But the answer was obvious: Luna had no idea what the ritual was. \r  \n\r  \nI looked around to see if anyone was within earshot. I nudged myself close to Luna, until our elbows touched. She seemed cold and distant.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAfter that, after the ritual I mean, it\u2019s done. It\u2019s not possible to escape anymore,\u201d I said.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked, perplexed. \r  \n\r  \nShe was still under the veil of the elders\u2019 indoctrination. She saw the cracks, but she didn\u2019t know the full story. I took a deep breath, and proceeded to explain everything about the ritual, what K\u2019aluth was, how I had escaped, Jacob\u2019s red eyes, how the watchers found me, and how everyone in my home had, eventually, died. I\u2019m not sure how long it took me to tell her all this, and I\u2019m sure my rambling was barely coherent, let alone chronological, but I remember my mouth becoming dry midway through. When I said it out loud, it all seemed so crazy that I wouldn\u2019t have put it past her to believe John\u2019s implication of my ramblings. Shit, before the ritual, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it either,\r  \n\r  \nLuna kept quiet. I could sense that she was thinking everything over, and that she was thinking me over as well. I was ready to jump off the rock and emancipate her from my madness. I felt like a disease, and she was slowly getting sick. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cSo, the day of the ritual is the best time to do it? Like, the way you did it?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nImmense relief washed over me. I hadn't lost her. She was still on my side. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cYeah, I think so,\u201d I said.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI can\u2019t leave without my mother. I can\u2019t let *that* happen to her.\u201d She turned to face me. Her usual tough, monotone expression was completely gone, replaced by wide, frightful eyes. \u201cYou need to understand that, Allison.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI nodded, but I knew that there was a distinct possibility that things wouldn\u2019t go according to plan. Her mom was in the grips of elder John, and I doubted whether she would even want to leave, if given the chance. It was hard enough for me to escape by myself, let alone get three people out.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cShould we tell her now? About leaving?\u201d I asked. I thought she should be the one to decide that.\r  \n\r  \nLuna thought about it, then said \u201cI get it. She\u2019s not\u2026 she\u2019s part of all this. So maybe we shouldn\u2019t tell her yet. But when we do it, we take her with us, okay? We\u2019ll force her, if we have to. And she\u2019ll listen to me. She *has* to.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWorks for me. But first we need a plan.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cRight.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cUhh, I don\u2019t have one. I mean, I did, but then, you know.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWe sat silently for a while, then Luna said \u201cI think I might have something.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cShoot.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOkay. So, you said that during the ritual everyone is at the main field, at the center of the compound, right?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYeah, so?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nShe lowered her voice. \u201cWell, there\u2019s one spot we could go through, right near the main gate. There\u2019s a burrow that goes under the fence, and I think it\u2019s just big enough to crawl under. They used to patch it up, but when it rains, it always comes back. Eventually they just stopped, so it's been there for at least a year. Anyway, it\u2019s near the gate, which is always guarded by some of the men, so it\u2019s not like anyone could sneak through. But if all the men are at the field --\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201c-- then it\u2019s unguarded, and we could go through.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nLuna smiled.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou think it could work?\u201d she asked. I got the impression that she thought of me as the expert, which I guess wasn\u2019t an entirely undeserved title.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s probably our best bet,\u201d I said. \u201cBut they\u2019re still going to be watching that spot with the *live-feeds*, so we need to be quick. And then there\u2019s of course your dad\u2026\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI can take care of him.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cBut then they\u2019ll just replace him.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cRight... But I know that the elders won\u2019t get their hands dirty, and they\u2019ll be busy leading the ritual anyway. I doubt they\u2019ll bring in a watcher to replace him - everyone was so spooked when you were brought in by an outsider, you know. The smartest move is for them to just have one of the other dads come and do it, after he\u2019s done with his own family.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI thought it over, and while I wasn\u2019t entirely sure if John wouldn\u2019t take the chance to personally scalp her mom, Luna\u2019s idea seemed like the most plausible outcome. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cOkay, so suppose all of this goes to plan,\u201d I said, \u201cwhat if the watchers are in the surrounding woods, just waiting for me - for us - to escape?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI guess we\u2019ll just have to count on them having something better to do.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYeah, like shoot up another sector or --\u201d\r  \n\r  \nMy sentence was cut short by a scream coming from afar on our right. We stood up to look, and on the main field, I saw a man being dragged. We quickly made our way back down and headed towards the barren field.\r  \n\r  \nBy the time we got there, a crowd had gathered. We slipped between them for a better look.\r  \n\r  \nThree men held down another man, standing over his arms and legs to prevent him from squirming. He was still screaming, but his face was in direct contact with the ground, which made his voice muffled as he puffed rough sand out with each breath. I heard something squeaking in the distance, and saw two more men rolling something big towards us. Once they were close enough, I saw that it was made of strong, dark wood, with three adjacent holes carved on the top, the one in the middle, which was larger than the others. \r  \n\r  \nThey unlatched something, and the holes were split in two as they opened up the apparatus. They placed the man\u2019s arms and head onto the crescent slits, then brought the apparatus back into its closed state, trapping him into it. He was slightly bent over, and his arms and head looked detached from the rest of his body as they dangled from the holes. He tried kicking the wooden thing, but it wouldn\u2019t budge. The men stood around, and from the hill descended father John, alongside two other elders who I had never seen before, who sported similar black jackets to the one elder John always wore.\r  \n\r  \nThe trapped man screamed for help, but once the men saw the elders approach, one of them hit him in the face. He quieted down, and the edge of his lip began to trickle with blood. It looked like it had been split in two.\r  \n\r  \nOnce the elders closed in, the crowd took a few steps back. Luna grabbed my arm, and we followed their movements, trying to blend into the crowd as best we could.\r  \n\r  \nElder John stood forward and looked at the man, and then turned to face the crowd.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThis man has plotted against us,\u201d he said, with mad power in his voice. He didn\u2019t sound like a frail old man - he sounded like a tyrant.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cTrue Love forbids wrongdoing against thy own brothers and sisters. This man plotted for the escape of his child, which would therefore bring us all to ruin. I\u2019m sure you can all understand that this is not right. For *one* of us to leave brings *everyone* closer to the dangers of the outside world. This is not what the One True God wills us. It is not the mark of a sane man.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe crowd kept quiet. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was because they *believed* in what John was saying, or because they were too afraid to stand up and say something. How many of them thought like Luna and I did? It was impossible to say.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHow ungrateful must he be, to scheme for escape?\u201d elder John continued. \u201cAfter the refuge we have given him, his wife, and his son? The food they eat, the water they drink, and the companionship that we have blessed them with?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAnd what else can we do, but give him a reminder of his dissidence?\u201d he said, his voice now low and directed at the man more than the crowd.\r  \n\r  \nAs if on cue, one of the men emerged with a handsaw. John nodded at him, and took a few steps back to rejoin the elders. John\u2019s gaze shifted to me, like he had somehow known I had been in the crowd the whole time. He smiled in the exact same way he had when Fred had pulled Luna out from under the bed. A cold fury ran up my spine. In his presence, I had been tiptoeing the line between fear and rage, and now that line had broken, and I ended up falling to the side of head-splitting anger. The only thing I could think was *I hate you*, the words salient and *real*. \r  \n\r  \nThe man with the handsaw approached the man in the apparatus, and began to move the jagged blade across his bare arm. The man erupted in a cacophony of shrieks, but he was trapped, unable to move anything but his feet and legs - the mightily thick wood made sure to keep him in place. He kicked and flailed, his hand clenching in a fist as the saw burrowed deeper with each swipe, but he could do nothing to protect himself. Although surrounded by his group, he was completely alone, and *we watched*.\r  \n\r  \nBoth of the men were quickly drenched in blood, and the sound coming from the saw\u2019s movements became quiet - at least until it hit the bone. \r  \n\r  \nThe man could barely make a fist anymore, and his face was splattered with blood which streamed down alongside his tears. The bone proved difficult to cut through, and each swipe came in a jagged, violent burst that was like two rocks being scraped together. Luna squeezed my arm so tight it began to hurt, but I didn\u2019t care. It felt better to feel pain; to somehow be a part of the man\u2019s experience, to emphatize through suffering.\r  \n\r  \nThe bone soon gave way, and the arm was split in two, held together by nothing but skin, muscle, and tendon. It flailed like a broken branch by its bark. It didn\u2019t take much more to snap the arm off, and it fell down, held midair by the handcuff secured to his other arm. The man twitched from pain, his legs kicking the severed limb thoughtlessly. The ground was red and wet, the sand clumping together by the blood.\r  \n\r  \nAnother man came and poured something from a plastic bottle onto the wound, and began to wrap it up in bandages.\r  \n\r  \nWe watched the man kick his dangling arm for a short while, until his strength slowly dissipated. He could no longer fight, and what was there to fight for, anyway? \r  \n\r  \nElder John stood with great posture, his aura filled with an evil hubris. He then turned around, and started back up the hill with the other elders in tow, signaling that the show was over. The crowd started to disperse, and it was me who had to grab Luna this time, dragging her away from the carnage. \r  \n\r  \nIn the morning, the man was gone, and there was nothing but crimson dirt left.",

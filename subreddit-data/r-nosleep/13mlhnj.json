    "postText": "What I\u2019m about to tell you is based on my personal experience, or rather\u2026 it\u2019s not over yet, so to speak\u2026 Anyway, here\u2019s the story.\n\nI\u2019m a 23-year-old man, working as a caregiver and living with my family.\nOur family consists of my father (52), mother (44), younger brother (18), and me. My brother was planning to start living on his own this spring for his new job. That evening, after dinner, we were all in the living room watching TV \u2013 my father, mother, and I. \n\nWe were discussing things like \u201cWhere should our brother live?\u201d and \u201cWhat does he need for living alone?\u201d Meanwhile, my brother was in his room (we shared the same room), preparing for his job (I guess?).\n\nZa za\u2026 za za za za\u2026\n\nSuddenly, there was a noise on the TV. It quickly subsided, so I didn\u2019t pay much attention and continued watching TV while saying, \u201c\u2026so, yeah.\u201d But when I shifted my gaze to my parents, I noticed something strange.\n\nBoth of my parents had their mouths half-open and were staring at the TV with wide-open eyes, as if they were shocked by something. \n\u201c!!\u2026 Huh!?\u2026 What!? What just happened!?\u201d I asked, feeling disturbed by their unfamiliar expressions. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d However, my parents ignored me and kept watching TV.\n\nSuddenly, only their wide-open eyes were looking at me. \n\u201c!!!! Huh!?\u201d The next moment, as if nothing had happened, my mother said, \u201cYeah, but our brother cooking for himself\u2026\u201d and my father said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it okay? Right, son?\u201d and they started talking.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026 Wait a minute! What was that just now!? What was that!?\u201d Both of my parents are not the type to make jokes or play around, and they have always been serious and strict. So, I couldn\u2019t possibly imagine them doing something like that as a joke.\n\nMy mother asked, \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018just now\u2019?\u201d and my father said, \u201c??\u201d. They both had confused looks on their faces. Knowing their personalities, I realized that their reactions were not to deceive someone, but their genuine reactions, and at the same time, it felt strange.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026 \u2018Just now\u2019\u2026 I mean\u2026\u201d I mumbled and looked down. My mother asked, \u201cBy the way, when will you die?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d My father added, \u201cYeah, we should talk about that too. When are you going to do it? Suicide? Or an accident?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I couldn\u2019t understand the meaning. \nI was quite puzzled by the sudden barrage of events. I stammered, \u201cUh\u2026 huh? I\u2026 die\u2026? Huh?\u2026\u201d But my parents continued the conversation as if it were completely normal.\n\nFather: \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this as well. It\u2019s about time.\u201d\n\nMother: \u201cI\u2019ll help you. It\u2019ll be okay. Right?\u201d\nMy parents continued to talk calmly.\nThey discussed things like hanging, sleeping pills being a good option, and how jumping off would be painless if you faint midway.\n\nIt was as if they had seen it before\u2026\nIn snippets of their conversation, I could hear laughter, as if something was amusing\u2026\n\u201cWait\u2026 Wait a minute!!! What the hell are you saying since earlier?!\u201d\nFeeling anxious and scared by my clearly different parents, I shouted loudly.\n\nMy parents turned their faces towards me.\n\u201cUh\u2026!!!\u201d\nTheir eyes were facing in opposite directions.\nFather: \u201cDie, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die\u201d\nMother: \u201cDie, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die\u201d\n\u201cAh!!!!!!\u201d\nTheir eyes were facing in opposite directions, but their faces were firmly directed towards me.\n\nLike broken dolls, they repeated \u201cdie\u201d over and over again.\nUnable to bear it any longer, I fled to my brother\u2019s room.\n\nBang!!\n\nBrother: \u201cWhoa! That scared me! What\u2019s wrong, big brother?\u201d\nMy brother was sitting at his desk, writing documents.\n\u201cUh\u2026 Listen! Dad and mom\u2026 their eyes were facing in opposite directions, and they were saying \u2018die\u2019\u2026 Oh! Before that, there was noise on the TV\u2026!!\u201d\n\nBrother: \u201cNo, sorry. I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t even understand what I was saying.\nI couldn\u2019t comprehend what was happening to me right now.\n\n\u201cListen\u2026 Listen, I mean\u2026 That\u2019s why\u2026\u201d\nUnable to understand anything, I held my head,\n\u201cA-anyway, dad and mom are acting strange\u2026!!!!!!\u201d\nMy brother had his mouth half-open and wide-open eyes\u2026\n\u201cOh\u2026 Ohh\u2026\u201d\nMy parents became strange, and now even my brother\u2026\nAs I watched my brother\u2019s eyes gradually facing in opposite directions, I ran towards the entrance.\n\nWhat is this?! What is this?! What is this?!\nBefore stepping outside, I glanced at the living room.\n\nMy parents were standing, facing towards me.\n\nTheir eyes were indeed facing in opposite directions\u2026\nI ran at full speed to a crowded area. After catching my breath, I called my coworker, who lived alone, explained the situation, and went to their house. This coworker could see spirits and ghosts, and they listened attentively to my incomprehensible story.\n\nCoworker: \u201cI see\u2026 Alright, tomorrow let\u2019s go to a temple of an acquaintance and ask for help. Rest for today. You look terrible.\u201d\n\nI stayed at my coworker\u2019s house that day. Needless to say, I couldn\u2019t sleep a wink.\nThe next day, my coworker had a night shift, and I had a day off. At 6 o\u2019clock in the morning, my coworker drove me to a temple about 30 minutes away, where I explained what happened the previous night to the head priest.\n\nHead Priest: \u201cI understand\u2026 It must have been tough. You look completely exhausted\u2026\u201d\nLooking at my face, the head priest expressed concern. After that, they said, \u201cWe can\u2019t leave it as it is,\u201d and decided to return to my house with my coworker and me.\n\nThe inside of the house was hell.\nMy father was walking through the living room and hallway, blood dripping from both his arms and legs. In the corner of the living room, there were several blood-stained knives discarded.\n\n\u201cAfter two more rounds, I\u2019ll cut the artery in my right leg\u2026\nAfter three more rounds, I\u2019ll cut the vein in my upper arm\u2026\u201d\nHe muttered to himself.\n\nMy mother was in the bathroom. \nShe was repeatedly submerging her head in the filled bathtub and resurfacing.\nPressing her own head with her hands\u2026\n\u201cAhaha, gulp, ahaha, gulp, ahaha, gulp\u2026\nJust before death!!! Just before death!!! Just before deeeeeeeath!!!\u201d\nMy brother was sitting at his desk, writing. However\u2026 he had a cutter in his hand, and there was a mirror on the desk.\n\n\u201cCity A, Town B\u2026\u201d\nHe was engraving our home address on his body.\nI cried in terror.\n\nAfterward, the three of us managed to get help from the head priest and other monks who were called for support. We are fine now. However, there are still scars on my brother\u2019s and father\u2019s bodies, and it greatly depresses me when I go to hot springs or similar places.\n\nI apologize for the lengthy and poorly written text.\nAfter that, I asked the head priest, and it seemed that the cause of my family\u2019s transformation was rooted in our ancestors. You know those lines you hear in period dramas like, \u201cI curse you and your descendants for generations to come\u201d? It seemed to be a real-life version of that.\n\nMoreover, the curse was brutal. It wasn\u2019t just about killing us outright. It involved possession, gradually tormenting the family over time. \n\nThat\u2019s what I was told. However, this time, the curse couldn\u2019t be easily executed. It turns out that in my past life, I was a high-ranking monk, and the curse couldn\u2019t touch me from the moment I was born. \n\nFrustrated by my immunity, they resorted to using my family as a means of pressure, repeatedly commanding them to \u201cdie.\u201d\n\nBut I managed to escape, and they said, \u201cWell, if we can\u2019t have him, at least the rest of the family\u2026\u201d However, the curse was so potent that the head priest couldn\u2019t completely remove it, and the rest of my family always carries protective charms.\nThe curse is still ongoing.\n\n'[X](https://www.jpnhorrorstories.com/)'",

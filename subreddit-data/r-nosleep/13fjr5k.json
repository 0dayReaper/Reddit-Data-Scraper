    "postText": "The house is burning. Only two of us made it out. There were six at the start of the evening. Seven, I suppose. That was the entire problem.\n\nI don\u2019t know when the seventh arrived. Deena and Angelo showed up first, while I was still putting out snacks. It must not have been there before them. I recall them being the first. It can\u2019t hide in nothing.\n\nKay showed up next. I know she was alone, because I\u2019ve been trying to figure out the right time to ask her out. If she\u2019d brought someone, I definitely would have noticed.\n\nWhen Christof and Marina got here, Angelo called out, \u201cIt\u2019s about time you two made it!\u201d He specified two, I remember that. That\u2019s five arrivals, and of course I was there all along. Maybe the door was opened at some other point.\n\nIt might not matter now that it\u2019s all over. I feel like it does, though. I need to understand what happened. I owe it to my friends.\n\nWe were playing cards when we noticed. It was a six-handed game, and Angelo was dealing piles in front of each player. One, two, three, four, five, six, and the seventh to himself.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got too many piles,\u201d Deena said.\n\nAngelo looked at the table in confusion. There were cards in front of each of us. There were seven separate stacks.\n\n\u201cWeird. I don\u2019t know what happened there,\u201d he said, gathering up the cards. He dealt them out again. One, two, three, four, five, six. One to each person, but he had not yet put a card in front of himself.\n\nWith a nervous chuckle, Angelo said, \u201cOkay, what am I doing wrong? Six of us, yes?\u201d\n\nWe all agreed. There were clearly six.\n\n\u201cEveryone put your hand on your card,\u201d he said.\n\nAll six cards were covered. Angelo still did not have one.\n\n\u201cAll right, one more try,\u201d said Angelo.\n\n\u201cWhile you\u2019re sorting this out, I\u2019m going to go to the bathroom,\u201d said Kay, standing up. She left the room. Angelo dealt the cards. One, two, three, four, and a fifth to himself.\n\n\u201cKay, how many people are you?\u201d he shouted.\n\n\u201cVery funny,\u201d she called back. We heard the bathroom door close.\n\n\u201cJust deal six hands,\u201d I told Angelo. \u201cThere are six of us. It\u2019ll work out. Everyone will pick one hand up and play it, and no one will be left out.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d really think so,\u201d he said. \u201cBut why was I getting to seven before?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re bad at math,\u201d Deena told him.\n\n\u201cBetter not let you keep the score,\u201d Christof chimed in.\n\nKay\u2019s chair was scooted back up to the table. Angelo dealt the cards. There were six hands this time. Everyone picked one up. No one was left out.\n\n\u201cWeird,\u201d said Angelo, shaking his head.\n\nDespite the rocky start, the game went well. Christof won, so as punishment we sent him to the kitchen to fetch more drinks. Just after he disappeared into the other room, I heard a startling noise, a sort of quick choking gasp followed by a loud bang. I was just getting up to see if he was all right when the wine was brought to the table, and I busied myself pouring everyone a fresh glass instead.\n\nI noticed that Kay\u2019s glass was still untouched from earlier.\n\n\u201cHey, where\u2019s Kay?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cShe went to the bathroom,\u201d said Deena.\n\n\u201cWhat, again?\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess.\u201d\n\nI leaned my head around the corner to see down the hallway. The bathroom door was closed. I supposed Marina was right.\n\n\u201cShall we deal another hand?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cAs soon as Christof gets back,\u201d said Marina.\n\nI looked around. Christof wasn\u2019t here.\n\n\u201cWhere did he go?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe kitchen,\u201d said Marina.\n\n\u201cThe wine didn\u2019t bring itself in here,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cAnd all five of the new glasses have been moved.\u201d\n\nMarina gasped. \u201cAre you suggesting that someone\u2014is drinking Christof\u2019s wine?\u201d\n\nWe all laughed. I did wonder where Christof was, though. And Kay, for that matter. She\u2019d been in the bathroom for a very long time.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t have been, though. We\u2019d played the game six handed. She must have been here. Maybe she just wasn\u2019t drinking.\n\n\u201cQuick round of spades while we\u2019re waiting for those two to get back?\u201d asked Angelo, dealing out the cards.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve dealt five hands,\u201d Deena pointed out.\n\nAngelo slammed the cards down on the table. \u201cOkay, something is going on here! Everyone, hold hands.\u201d\n\nWe all looked at him quizzically, but he was serious. We reached out and took each others\u2019 hands, forming a circle around the table.\n\n\u201cNow, in order. Everyone say the name of the person to your left.\u201d\n\nMy name was said. I looked left and said, \u201cMarina.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeena.\u201d\n\n\u201cAngelo.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m next to Scott,\u201d Angelo said, nodding at me.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d I objected. \u201cMy name was already said.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the right,\u201d he said.\n\nAngelo\u2019s name was said. He followed it with \u201cDeena.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarina.\u201d\n\n\u201cScott.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Angelo,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cNo, I was named first,\u201d he said.\n\nWe looked at each other. I could feel his hand in mine. I could see him next to me.\n\n\u201cLook at the table,\u201d Angelo said. \u201cWhy is there an extra glass of wine in between us?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a photo,\u201d said Marina. \u201cThen we can see everyone at once.\u201d\n\nShe put her phone on the table. We all backed up, put our arms around each other and smiled. The photo snapped. We gathered back around the table to look.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s you, me, you and you,\u201d said Marina, pointing. \u201cFour of us. No one else.\u201d\n\nAngelo studied it for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s not a selfie. Who took the picture?\u201d\n\n\u201cChristof,\u201d said Marina.\n\n\u201cKay,\u201d I said in the same moment.\n\nWe all looked around the room. Neither one of them was here.\n\n\u201cHe must still be in the kitchen,\u201d said Marina. \u201cI\u2019ll go see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we should all go together,\u201d said Angelo. \u201cCome on.\u201d\n\nWe entered the kitchen as a group. It was empty.\n\n\u201cDo you smell gas?\u201d asked Deena.\n\nMy attention snapped to the stove. Two of the knobs for the burners were snapped off. I spotted them tucked under the cabinets nearby, as if someone had pushed them out of the way so as not to be noticed. There was a dent in the metal of the edge, too.\n\n\u201cChristof must have dropped something on the stove,\u201d I said, heading over to see about turning off the gas. \u201cNice of him to mention it.\u201d\n\nThe knobs were broken too far down to turn. The gas was starting to give me a headache. I grabbed a hold of the stove to pull it out from the wall and shut off the line behind it, but it was surprisingly heavy.\n\n\u201cDid I leave something in here?\u201d I asked, opening the oven door.\n\nChristof\u2019s body was crammed inside, the limbs bent and folded back on themselves in order to make it fit. A gory pool of blood filled the bottom of the oven, sloshing distressingly back and forth from my attempts to move the appliance. Most of it seemed to have come from his head, which had been violently crushed. His eyes bulged outward, staring at me.\n\nI screamed, of course. We all did. I turned away\u2014to run, to find a weapon, possibly just not to see it anymore\u2014and Deena died.\n\nHer throat was ripped open. It wasn\u2019t when I turned back, and then it was. Nothing did it. It just happened. Her hands flew up to clasp her ruined neck, but it was far too late to hold anything in. She collapsed to her knees. Her hair was held back as she died, keeping her upright and facing forward so we could all see the panic and despair.\n\nWe were all frozen for a second. Angelo moved first, diving for her, but by the time he wrapped his arms around her she was slumping forward, already gone. He screamed, a raw caterwaul of rage and pain. After a moment, he focused it into words.\n\n\u201cWhere is it? What did this?\u201d\n\nI grabbed a knife and put my back into a corner, looking around frantically. Marina was gone. I hoped that she had run. I didn\u2019t like that I didn\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been here all night,\u201d Angelo hissed. \u201cAmong us. Playing with us. Where\u2019s Kay? Where has she been all night?\u201d\n\nThe bathroom, I thought, but I pictured Christof\u2019s broken body in the oven and I knew that I did not want to open the door to check.\n\nAngelo continued his rant, his voice cracking in his fury. \u201cWe can\u2019t see it. We can\u2019t know about it. You and I thought we were holding hands when it was between us. This is all a game to it. We don\u2019t know how to play. We can\u2019t even see the board!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out, Angelo,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe to be in here. Even without whatever\u2019s happening, the stove\u2019s still leaking gas.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d he said, and his voice was suddenly eerily calm. \u201cEverywhere. And you know, that\u2019s an awfully good way to deal with something you can\u2019t see.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing, Angelo?\u201d\n\nHe fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a lighter. \u201cThe back door\u2019s right there, Scott. Run, and close it behind you. Don\u2019t stop running when you\u2019re outside.\u201d\n\n\u201cAngelo\u2014!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your house, Scott. Run.\u201d\n\nI took a step toward him, but he pulled the lighter in toward his body. \u201cGo. If you don\u2019t go now, I\u2019ll do it while you\u2019re still in here. I probably ought to anyway. It\u2019s a better way to be sure.\u201d\n\nHe flicked the lighter. It sparked. I fled for the door. Behind me, I could hear him flicking the wheel again.\n\nI made it outside before the kitchen exploded. I had my hand on the knob pulling the door shut, when a roar of heat and light slammed the door closed and flung me down the stairs onto my back lawn. The windows erupted in gouts of flame, pelting me with burning hot glass.\n\nI scrambled along the grass, desperate to get further away. My back was burning, and I rolled to put it out.\n\nThe house is clearly a loss, but I called the fire department anyway. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll tell the police when they find the bodies inside. I don\u2019t even know how many they\u2019ll find.\n\nIf Angelo got it, whatever it was, then there\u2019ll be at least four bodies. Him, Deena, Christof and the other. Probably five, assuming it got Kay early on. Maybe six, if Marina didn\u2019t make it out.\n\nOne of them must have, though. I\u2019m not alone out here.\n\nMy hand is held tightly as I watch the house burn.  \n\\-  \n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/micahwrites/)",

I promise you I am being 100000% serious. It\u2019s frightening and not cool when it\u2019s real.",

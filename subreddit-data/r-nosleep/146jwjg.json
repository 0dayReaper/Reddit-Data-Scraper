    "postText": "I woke up in a sewage pit last Saturday.\n\nIt was the best start to the weekend I\u2019ve had in a while. Or at least, it was better than my alternative, which would have been a morgue. One that was full of people I hate, and terrors harder to stomach than human shit and gray water.\n\nAnd Unit 240.\n\nLord, this is going to make no sense.\n\n*Fuck.*\n\nRight. My name is Lettie Harper. I\u2019m currently typing this in a friend's house somewhere in the armpit of the Eastern Seaboard, wearing clothes I stole from a Walmart, and I smell like the soap they have in truck-stop bathrooms.\n\nSince the Nixon administration\u2014I didn\u2019t count before then\u2014I have died three-hundred and twenty-seven times.\n\nI am twenty-three years old.\n\nI'm truly sorry I can't prove this right now. There's a box buried in a soybean field in Gridley, Illinois, which contains every passport and driver's license I owned from 1929 until 1965, all of which clearly show my face. But I can't drive over there and dig it up. And it seems a bad idea to post my more...physical evidence.\n\nBut take my word, aye? For all it helps.\n\nBecause you don\u2019t want this.\n\nNot that living forever is bad.\n\nBut because of the things which you meet when you do.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nMy life first went to hell in 1935, in a cafeteria in Chicago. I was one year out of Brown's Business College. Work was sparse. But I could use a computator (look it up), type a hundred words a minute, and I was never as bad off as the tenant farmers or the panhandlers. That day I spent my lunch break watching the game tables at the back of the shop.\n\nIt was the day I met *her.*\n\nI want to say there was a strange discomfort in the air. That perhaps the dust from the South was particularly thick in my throat. That I woke up with an ache in my bones.\n\nBut that's probably the fog of memory.\n\nAnyway, I was going about my normal business. Bought a sandwich and a coffee, scarfed them down. Talked a bit. Watched a bit.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t have felt as unusual as it did when someone recognized me.\n\n\u201cLetitia?\u201d A strange voice asked behind me.\n\nI jumped.\n\nTurning around, for a heart\u2019s beat I saw something sharp and skeletal. Something which oozed. Which wore bones like a suit and spoke with a dead tongue.\n\nAnd I could only stare limply.\n\nIn front of me stood a quite beautiful older woman, somewhere in her forties. I didn't recognize her. She wore a beat-up green coat with floral embroidery on both lapels, and gold epaulets.\n\n\u201cUm.\u201d I said.\n\nShe smiled at me.  \u201cI heard you give your name.\u201d She nodded to the lunch bar. \u201cLetitia, yes? Do you play chess? You\u2019ve been watching the tables so...*intently.*\u201d\n\nHer voice was grating. In a way I cannot write.\n\nBut my brain kicked itself. \u201cUh.\u201d I said. I laughed nervously. \"Only horrendously.\"\n\nShe nodded. I asked her if she came here often. And she said, no she hadn't, but that, \"I always run in places where the prizes are worth winning.\"\n\nI think perhaps my greatest fault, still living a mortal life then, was my unwillingness to accuse random people of being supernatural beings. Instead I stuck my hands in the pockets of my skirt, and tampered down a terrible feeling rising up in my chest, telling me to run.\n\nI should mention I am sure now that this woman was something like Death.\n\nI should mention I am sure that day that she was collecting souls.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been challenging everyone all day.\u201d She told me. \u201cDreadful work. So much a person can win in a chess game, if they're willing to bet for it.\u201d The woman tilted her head. \u201cWhat do you play?\u201d\n\n\u201cBackgammon.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t mean to say that. It just sort of tumbled out of my mouth.\n\nThe woman grinned at me with smokers teeth.\n\n\u201cWell I can do *that.*\u201d\n\nShe held a palm out, revealing a corner of the shop I hadn\u2019t noticed before, pushed between a bookshelf and a radio cabinet. There was another table here, with two chairs. They were decked with velvet pillows.\n\nIt seemed enormously sophisticated.\n\nI don\u2019t remember agreeing to play. But I know there was a terror in my chest. This awful *dread*. And when I came back to myself, the woman was handing me a stack of white pieces.\n\nIt was scrimshaw bone.\n\n\u201cCome on.\u201d She said. \u201cSit down. It\u2019ll be *the game of your life.*\u201d\n\nI blinked.\n\nI will admit now that I am not an intelligent woman. But I have had a lot of tries at this whole being alive thing, and if I have any one bit of advice that I carry with me, it is this: if anyone strange you meet seems to be telling jokes to themself, you run.\n\n\u201cI have to use the lavatory.\u201d I said, far too loudly.\n\nMany things happened at once.\n\nI set the checkers in my pocket. I was preparing to flee madly. To run out the door from a situation which I could not quite make sense of but from which the scent of danger burned hot and unpleasantly.\n\nThen the woman turned. She looked like a cat, realizing that a mouse was running off with both its dinner and its claws.\n\nI made it three steps to the door.\n\nShe picked up the doubling die. Flipped it to an eight. Turned it sideways.\n\nAnd her hand began to melt.\n\nThe skin came off in sloughing bits, revealing red flesh beneath, inlaid with dirt, plants, *mud*. A moldy smell filled the room. Like rotting fish.\n\nNot one person in that caf\u00e9 turned toward us as I began to shout.\n\nWhen the woman hit me, we crashed into the floor with a monstrous *thud*. By now most of her skin had sloughed off. She reached her skinned thumb up, and held it right under my eye. Her face was fit for a demon, with burning eyes and rage, and intensity.\n\nA fat, pink, worm emerged from her finger.\n\nAnd squirmed toward my vision.\n\nI wish I could say I fainted. That I woke up like this, unknowing of my own condition. But I didn't. I remember every second as that worm tunneled its way through my eye. The sick pop of its burrow. The blistering headache.\n\nThe way its slick body began to chew through my skull.\n\nI remember how I screamed until my voice gave out.\n\n\u201c*You will not get the peace of death, you coward.*\u201d The woman whispered.\n\nAnd this all began.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Right*. I hear a car coming down the road. I\u2019m going to go hide in the root cellar again.\n\nShe shows up sometimes, you know.\n\nIn the corners of my eye, watching. These days her eyes are black pits. Her jaw hangs in a slack parody of a grin.\n\nI live in hell. And it terrifies me.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/user/Beanhedge/comments/13jkvqg/the_story_hole/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)",

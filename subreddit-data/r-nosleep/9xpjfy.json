    "postText": "I recently went through a pretty nasty divorce, but I got the only thing that mattered out of it: full custody of my 4-year old son.\n\n\nLost nearly everything else in the process so we had to relocate to a new house with barely any luggage or furniture.\n\n\nTruly a fresh new start.\n\n\nI heard him call for me during our first night at our new home. It was a little after midnight, I think. I went to check on him to see what was wrong and sat by his bedside.\n\n\nHe was wide awake and asked me to check the closet for monsters, which wasn\u2019t surprising given the circumstances.\n\n\nHe\u2019s still just a little kid, and without even taking into account all the crap he\u2019s been put through thanks to my shitty marriage, moving into an unfamiliar, barely furnished home must be a lot to take in for someone his age.\n\n\nAnd you know how they say that your brain always stays half-awake when you\u2019re sleeping in a new environment, right?\n\n\nThat\u2019s all pretty much what went through my mind in a flash as soon as my son spoke.\n\n\nIt was no big deal. It was all normal, I thought.\n\n\nBut something else almost immediately clicked inside my brain, before I even got to look at where my son had pointed to while he made his innocent request.\n\n\nSomething was wrong.\n\n\nI turned my head and looked, and it took everything I had in me to not give in to fear and terror, all for the sake of my son.\n\n\nWhen you become a parent you have to protect your children no matter what, always putting yourself in harm\u2019s way if necessary and spare them any and all kinds of things that might hurt them.\n\n\nThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t freak out. I couldn\u2019t, not when we had barely just started our new life. I had to protect him, and at that point in time as I sat on his bed I only knew one thing:\n\n\nWe had to leave the room.\n\n\nWe had to leave the house *immediately*.\n\n\n\u201cAlright champ, of course\u201d I said, faking bravery.\n\n\nThen I made a request of my own as I lowered my voice and got closer to him:\n\n\n\u201cHey, how about you step outside for a minute? If there\u2019s a monster in there, I\u2019ll have to kick its *BUTT* all over your room!\u201d\n\n\nHe chuckled and said \u201c*okay*\u201d.\n\n\nI made sure to put some extra emphasis on the word \u201c*butt*\u201d because it\u2019s something that always cracks him up when I say it. Fortunately he got stuck on that and not the fact that I was indirectly admitting to the possibility of there actually being a monster.\n\n\nAs soon as he left the room my mind raced as it started to put together the best and most efficient route to take him out of the house while picking my car keys and phone on our way out.\n\n\nWhen I heard the closet doors slowly creaking open behind me I knew it was time to go.\n\n\nI jumped out of the bed, exited the room and grabbed my son. We were out of the door and inside the car and moving in under a minute.\n\n\nI told him I couldn\u2019t sleep so we were going out for some ice-cream to celebrate. He was a little taken aback and asked \u201c*celebrate what*\u201d, to which I replied \u201c*just us two together, I love you buddy.*\u201d\n\n\nIt was by no means a lie, but I just had to make sure that he was alright and wouldn\u2019t think of anything else as we literally fled our new home.\n\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the house was a new environment for the two of us. I\u2019d been there a couple of times before, cleaned it all up by myself and assembled what little furniture we had, so I knew for a fact what belonged where and what didn\u2019t.\n\n\nAnd I know his room didn\u2019t have a closet.",

There were a few times when I was alone in the house while reading some of the most terrifying sequences of The Navidson Record, and you can imagine how that felt in a building that literally embodied the uncanny feeling of strange space that the author used so effectively.\n\nI remember being particularly affected by the climactic sequence of TNR, and thinking to myself, \"Gee, good thing I never have to feel what it's like to be completely surrounded by unfathomable darkness.\" Later that night, back at home, my friend went to bed unusually early, so I was left on my own while very high. I made some food, brought the bowl into my room, and then \u2014 darkness. Total darkness, the color of pitch. I couldn't see even an inch past my nose. It hit me right in the chest. I remember slowly sitting down on my invisible bed, watching my phone battery slip past 2%, and spending the next few minutes wrapping my high, terrified mind around this absurd coincidence. It didn't seem like one at the time, and I started thinking I could hear a distant roar.\n\nThen my friend came into the kitchen with a flashlight, and we hung out on the porch for the rest of the night. Turns out the power had gone out at once for the entire damn city, and since it was cloudy, there was literally zero light.",

Hopefully your housemate also moved out quickly, and whoever moved in after, either were just fine and got lucky, or they did cleanse the house. I don't 100% believe in all that, but when I moved into a new apartment, part of an 80 year old house, some weird things were happening, not creepy, but weird, like very often stuff would fall, an entire shelf in the glass cabinet just broke and so did 80% of our glasses, and things like that, I did a cleansing with sage and lavender, put a quartz at the entrance, poured salt on entrance doors and windows, and it stopped. It could have been a coincidence, but what did I have to lose.",

            "comment": "Based on the following quote from OP, I have my own \u201cnope\u201d moment to share...\n\n\u201cI turned my head and looked, and it took everything I had in me to not give in to fear and terror, all for the sake of my son.\u201d \n\nSo here\u2019s my story...\n\nAfter living in a nice, but small, two bedroom condo, my son and I moved into my granddad\u2019s house when he passed away. The condo had an open floor plan, with the kitchen, dining area, and living room being one big room. The house, however, has three bedrooms, two baths, separate kitchen, dining room, and living room, along with a basement and big attic. It is an old house, so with its size and many rooms, it was easy to get spooked by a benign noise. \nThe house needed some updating, so my son (who was four at the time) and I shared a room and my king-sized bed while I was painting and getting his room set up. \n\nOne night while lying in bed, my son whispers \u201cmommy, I feel like someone is in the house with us.\u201d \n\nThis completely and utterly freaked me the f out! I wanted to grab him, my keys, and run out of the house without looking back. But I was the mommy, and it was my job to reassure and protect him. So I promised him there was no one else in the house with us. He was satisfied, and drifted off to sleep. Needless to say, I didn\u2019t sleep a wink that night. For good measure, I searched every inch of that house the next day. I found nothing. \n\nMy granddad built the house, and it has stayed in the family. So I know no one has ever died there. My granddad was in the hospital when he passed, and he was in a nursing home for a couple of months before that. When I would visit him, he would keep repeating \u201cI just want to get back to [his home address.] (It was a bit odd that he referred to his house with the address instead of saying he wanted to go home, but that\u2019s not important.) My point is, I wonder if my granddad did go back to the house after he passed. They say animals and small children are more sensitive to spirits. So maybe my son was right - there was someone in the house with us.",

It still does seem like the guy overreacted quite a bit, at least to my eyes, but I was thinking about this, and you know what it's like when you buy a house? Or get an apartment? You know everything about that place. You have seen the floor plans, you have planned where you're going to put everything, you have moved stuff in (obviously the guy already has a bed installed for his kid, he has spent some time there).  Good God, imagine on your first night in the new place like that a damn new door appears on the wall and your kid thinks there's a creature in there.",

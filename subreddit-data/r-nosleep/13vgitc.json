    "postText": "For context, I was 12 years old when this happened to me. My dad would often take me to the grocery store, wait in the parking lot, and have me do the shopping in order for me to \u201cbuild independence.\u201d This is why I was alone at the time of the incident. \n\nAnyways, the day it happened, I entered the store as usual, roaming the aisles and occasionally dropping items into my cart. All was normal until I noticed a man was following me throughout the store. It shouldn\u2019t have been too panicking, but for me, as a kid with no cell phone and no way to contact my parents, it got a lot more terrifying than I suppose it would\u2019ve been for an adult. The man confirmed my suspicions when I circled the same aisle 3 times and he was right behind me each time. \n\nSince it was getting kind of late, a lot of the customers had started leaving the store with their purchases. The store slowly became more desolate, and my fear skyrocketed.\n\nDesperate to get to my dad and away from this man, I sped to checkout. I should have just booked it, but I desperately wanted to prove myself \u201cnot a chicken\u201d to my dad, stand my ground, and get the groceries I came for. \n\nI went to a checkout and started scanning, attempting to maintain my composure. I had started to convince myself that I was overreacting and that the man was not following me and that I was just paranoid when the man came up to me. \n\n\u201cHi!\u201d he said in a cheery voice. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but wonder why such a young girl like you is here alone! You must be a brave girl!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, I\u2026\u201d I couldn\u2019t speak. I was so terrified I almost pissed myself. \u201cI\u2019m not here alone. My dad is here.\u201d \n\n\u201cIs he? I didn\u2019t see him with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the bathroom.\u201d God, I sucked at lying. \n\nThe man crouched down and got to eye-level with me. \u201cTell you what: I\u2019ll pay for your groceries and give you a ride home. How does that sound?\u201d \n\nAlarm bells went off in my head. Everything my mother had drilled into my head about not going with strangers was screaming at me. I froze.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026 I have a ride. Th-thanks for offering though. And I can pay for the groceries.\u201d \n\nThroughout the conversation I was quickly scanning the groceries as fast as I could. I finished up, and was about to pay for the groceries when the man smiled maliciously at me, swept my hand aside and said, \u201cNo trouble, sweetie. I\u2019ll pay.\u201d He put his card into the machine. It accepted the payment, and he took my hand along with the groceries. \u201cNow come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nThe second his cold, bony hand took mine my instincts kicked in. I squirmed out of his grip and noped out of the grocery store, without the groceries. I started screaming at the top of my lungs and ran as fast as I could to my dad\u2019s car. He opened the door, put out his cigarette, and started asking me what happened. At this point I was sobbing, and tears ran down my cheeks as I recanted my tale to him. A couple minutes later, we pulled out of the parking lot and drove home.\n\nTo this day, I have no idea why the man didn\u2019t pursue me when I ran. If he had, I would\u2019ve been caught, no question. But to the man who almost abducted me when I was 12: I wish you the worst. I hope some day you rot in hell.",

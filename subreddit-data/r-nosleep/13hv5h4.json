It currently sat on the glass coffee table in our hotel room as quiet as a church mouse, and yet the picture of a man who\u2019d be assassinated only a year later might as well have had a tornado siren growing out of it. To say our lunch, as delicious as it had been, had been permeated with an awkward, strained silence would be an understatement of massive proportions. As soon as we\u2019d finished eating and paid the bill, the two of us had practically dashed back to the relative safety and privacy of our room to talk and try and get our heads round our current predicament.\r  \n\r  \nPaula finally stopped pacing back and forth and looked at me, wrapping a lock of her hair around her finger and biting her lip. \u201cBut\u2026how?\u201d she finally asked. I shook my head, unable to give her the answer she so desperately sought for. I\u2019m not a scientist by any stretch of the imagination; hell, I\u2019m barely qualified to work as a manager for my company in the first place. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know, honey\u201d I said quietly, \u201cUp until today, I thought time travel was impossible. Something only talked about seriously by people nostalgic for an era they could never return to, or by those without both feet in reality. But\u2026it seems *they* were right the whole time\u2026\u201d I trailed off, shaking my head as my mind fought to push away what I could plainly see in front of me to be true.\r  \n\r  \nI stood up from the couch and walked across to the balcony door. It faced out onto the main drag, and looking down, I watched the endless procession of vintage cars move up and down the boulevard. *No, not vintage cars, Danny*, my mind whispered to me. *They\u2019re modern day cars for everyone. Everyone but you*. I turned away and back to my wife, who was now perched on the edge of the couch. She looked up at me, a mixture of confusion and worry filling her face. Crossing back over, I sat down next to her and wrapped her in my arms. I sighed. After a moment, she pulled away and looked at me, nodding in appreciation. \u201cLook, however we\u2019ve ended up in this situation, we need to keep a level head here\u201d I said to her, \u201cWe need to keep calm and make sure, above all else, we stay okay\u201d Paula stayed quiet for a moment, then nodded. \u201cI agree\u201d She stood up from the couch and began pacing again, a trademark sign she was deep in thought.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOkay, the first thing we need to do, is make sure we don\u2019t stand out anymore than necessary\u201d she continued, \u201cSo, we\u2019ll call down to reception and ask them where the nearest clothing store is. We\u2019ll get ourselves some clothes to blend in with everyone else\u201d She suddenly looked up at me. \u201cBut what are we going to do about money?\u201d she asked. I searched my mind for older facts about the past I learned from hours of scouring the internet. \u201cWell, we\u2019re already very well set for money, because if I remember correctly, after what we spent on the hotel room and lunch, we still have about the equivalent of eight or nine grand left. *But*, I know that won\u2019t last forever, so, I say, with a lot of caution, we try and bet a little money here and there on things such as horse and greyhound racing. Maybe even try some of the slot machines. But not too much, though. Vegas in the sixties was still as rigged as Vegas in the 21st Century, after all\u201d\r  \n\r  \nPaula nodded, seemingly satisfied with my answer. \u201cWell, that\u2019ll possibly help. We have two weeks booked here, so we\u2019ll be able to, hopefully find a way to get\u2026\u201d she trailed off and looked at me. \u201cDanny, how are we going to get back to our own time?\u201d I ran my fingers through my hair; she\u2019d asked the very question I\u2019d been pondering over since lunch. I sighed. *It\u2019d be so much easier if we knew how we\u2019d gotten here in the first place. Then we could simply do the reverse to return\u2026if that\u2019d even work*. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know, sweetheart\u201d I admitted, \u201cBut, we\u2019ll cross that bridge when we do\u201d A lightbulb suddenly went off inside my head, and I shot up to my feet like I\u2019d been struck by lightning. \u201cThe elevator operator!\u201d For a moment, Paula\u2019s face remained blank, then realization crossed her face. \u201cOf course!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cHe\u2019d mentioned how others dressed like us had shown up before. That means others have accidentally traveled back in time, and it means they may have found a way back!\u201d\r  \n\r  \nA smile crossed her face. \u201cIf we can talk to him, maybe others who\u2019ve seen them before, we might be able to figure out what they did\u201d I nodded, already having come to the same conclusion as her and returned her smile. *And that is why this woman is my wife; she has both beauty and brains*. \u201cUntil we\u2019re able to, though, I say, let\u2019s try and enjoy our time here. We\u2019re in a time neither of us thought we\u2019d ever see outside of pictures and films. So, let\u2019s take it in while we can. Go to the shows, see the sights, do all we can while we can\u201d Paula grinned. \u201cTook the thought right out of my head, darling\u201d she said, crossing to me and wrapping her arms around my neck before pressing her lips to mine. \u201cWe always heard about the swingin' sixties. Time to find out how swinging they really were\u201d\r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately, it turned out that the elevator operator we\u2019d seen that morning had the next week off, and wouldn\u2019t be returning until the following Friday. So, in the meantime, Paula and I did our best to enjoy ourselves. It really wasn\u2019t that hard; In fact, 1962, especially in Vegas, was extremely fun. The two of us each bought several sets of period clothing as we\u2019d planned. Wearing a suit outside of company meetings felt incredibly weird, I must say. But man, did Paula look stunning when she walked out of the woman\u2019s clothing shop, clad in an ornate white dress with straps which criss-crossed underneath her neck and a pair of high heels. \u201cWow\u201d I breathed as she stepped outside and twirled around for me to see, causing her face to turn red. \r  \n\r  \nMy plan to try and make money off the casino games and betting actually worked out better than I thought it would. Paula had always been amazing at card games such as poker and blackjack, while thanks to my old man and his love of visiting the horse and dog tracks in the nineties and early 2000s when he was still alive, I\u2019d picked up on how to more often than not pick up on the contestants most likely to win. Between the two of us, we made over $3,000 in three days; more than enough to cover what we\u2019d need.\r  \n\r  \nAnd to say nothing about the amazing shows we went to see. Watching legends of the previous generation such as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr. perform at *The Sands* was nothing short of amazing, sitting in the huge room which filled with a hazy cloud of cigarette smoke as Old Blue Eyes and company belted out some of their biggest hits. The shows which *The Dunes* had on were amazing as well. Arthur had been right when he said that Diana Dors had an amazing singing voice. When we sat down at our table and saw her walk out onto stage that first night, Paula gasped aloud. For my part, so did I; The singer and actress looked uncannily like my wife. \u201cYou could be her younger freakin\u2019 sister\u201d I whispered to her as the lights went down. She simply looked at me, laughed softly and nodded. Apparently, we weren\u2019t the only ones to have that thought; after spotting us in the audience, I saw Diana do a double take at my wife, before continuing with her performance like the professional I could tell she must be. After the show, she came over to us to introduce herself.\r  \n \r  \n\u201cMy dear, you and I are almost dead ringers for each other!\u201d she exclaimed to Paula with an accent that instantly gave her away as British. Almost instantly, the two women seemed to connect and develop an friendship with one another, to the point it ended up with us being invited to dinner with her and her husband. Who, to my shock, turned out to be Richard Dawson of *Hogan\u2019s Heroes* and *Family Feud* fame. I\u2019d grown up seeing reruns of both shows on TV when I stayed home sick from school. Of course, seeing as neither of those things had happened yet, I had to keep my mouth shut and pretend I didn\u2019t know who he was. After an amazing dinner, Diana personally extended an invitation for us to attend her shows, and the whole of *La Parisienne* the entire time we were staying at the hotel at a specially reserved table, as her guests. And so, we made a ritual for the next twelve days or so out of ending our days watching her sing her heart out. To this day, I can still close my eyes and hear her voice echoing in that room. I likely will the rest of my life. The two of us had an amazing time. Everything seemed almost too good to be true, too amazing and fun.\r  \n\r  \nExcept for something I never told Paula about. Something I know she would have flipped out over.\r  \n\r  \nI only really noticed it on the fourth day. I\u2019d pushed the terrifying incidents from the parking lot and the elevator out of my mind in an effort to enjoy myself. In fact, I\u2019d managed to half convince myself that the elevator incident had, in fact, been a hallucination, and I\u2019d simply lost my cell phone somewhere else. But that illusion was shattered when we stepped off the elevator and waved to Arthur. Because someone\u2026or *something*, stepped out from the shadows behind him. Just long enough for me, and me alone to see, before stepping back and seeming to melt away in the darkness. \r  \n\r  \nIt was one of the black clad figures. From my nightmare dash through what I could only describe as the hellish, nightmare version of the hotel. And almost as if to drive home the point that it hadn\u2019t been a dream, I saw it raise its hand and wave something at me. Something which I immediately recognized, and made all the blood drain out of my face. It was my smartphone. *Oh, fuck me*, my mind quietly whispered to itself as the figure vanished back into the black.\r  \n\r  \nAfter that first encounter, I began to realize that the two of us were being followed almost everywhere we went. Whoever they were, were extremely good at not standing out. They always acted so inconspicuous, always blending in with the crowds around them. I only caught onto to them when I began to see the same hats and coats filtering through the crowds. But they were always careful enough to never let me see their faces. They\u2019d always duck their heads, shielding their features with the wide brims of their hats. But they were always there. To say I began to feel paranoid and fearful would be the understatement of the century. I felt like a character in an old Alfred Hitchcock film, a mouse stalked by a cat which didn\u2019t want to catch and eat it yet, but wanted its prey to know it was there. I would manage to push it out of my mind when Paula and I began to have fun, but whenever I would catch sight of them, the happy atmosphere would pop like a child\u2019s balloon.\r  \n\r  \nBy the next Thursday, my nerves were completely fried, and as much as I enjoyed the fun times we had, all I wanted was to speak to the elevator operator the next day and find a way to get back home. Paula noticed, and when she asked me what was wrong, I did something which I still regret. I lied. I told her it was just the stress of getting back to modern times, not wanting to freak her out by telling her we were being tailed by God only knew who. I will always count that as one of my biggest mistakes, something done out of some fucking ridiculous sense of wanting to protect her. If I hadn\u2019t been so stupid, it might have saved us a lot of the horror still to come.\r  \n\r  \nThe two of us had just stepped off the elevator, heading for what might very well be the final show in *The Dunes* we\u2019d ever attend when we heard a voice call out to us. \u201cMr. and Mrs. Clements!\u201d I turned to see Arthur beaming at us and waving us over to him. \u201cYou two are due to check out soon, I see\u201d he said, looking down into the guest ledger on the counter in front of him. Paula and I exchanged a pensive look at each other before I spoke. \u201cWell, we\u2019re not exactly sure whether we\u2019ll be leaving on Sunday or not, Arthur\u201d I said. Paula spoke up. \u201cYeah, you see, we may end up having more time we\u2019re able to spend here, and we may just end up extending our stay another week or so ago. That is, if we\u2019re able to\u201d I silently prayed we wouldn\u2019t be told that our room wasn\u2019t reserved; if it was, we had another problem to add onto our plate.\r  \n \r  \nBut Arthur simply gave us his trademark smile. \u201cAbsolutely, you two! We have no other reservations for your room for the next two weeks, at least. Just let me know before Saturday night if you\u2019d like to extend your stay!\u201d We thanked him, and with that problem solved, hurried to catch Diana and the rest of the performance. Even after seeing it so many times I\u2019d mentally mapped exactly when and where everything would happen, we still enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. When it ended, Diana came over and told us, not without a slight trace of sadness in her voice, that she and her husband were flying back to Los Angeles the following morning. Apparently, she was going to be appearing on a game show called *Stump the Stars* in a few months time. It was a bit of a bittersweet parting, to say the least. Paula and her shared a hug goodbye, and so did I a moment later.\n\n\r\u201cDon\u2019t forget about us, okay?\u201d I said to her after stepping back from our embrace. I hadn\u2019t intended for the words which I'd whispered in my head to slip out, but they had. I saw Paula shoot me a bit of a concerned look out of the corner of my eye. Diana let out a laugh, but I could see a bit of a curious look enter her eyes. \u201cWhy, I don\u2019t think I could ever forget either of you two\u201d she said, \u201cEspecially not where you\u2019re married to my doppelganger!\u201d I laughed back, but for a moment, I internally debated about telling her the truth. About where Paula and I were from, *when* we were from, and everything in between. But I held my tongue, knowing it could end badly if I did. And so, the two of us bid her a safe flight and watched her leave the auditorium for the last time.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cCome on, darling\u201d Paula said, taking me by the arm, \u201cLet\u2019s get back up to our room and get some sleep. We have a busy day tomorrow\u201d I nodded, allowing her to lead me back through the lobby to the bank of elevators. Along the way, though, I made my head swivel around like an owl\u2019s, searching in all directions for any sign of our stalkers. But I saw no one. No men in coats and hats. In a way, it filled me with a bit of a relief. But it also made me feel more on edge than ever. Not seeing hide or hair of them made it feel like something was up. *I pray to God it\u2019s not. I just want to get up to our room to sleep*.\r  \n\r  \nThe elevator let out its now familiar *ding*, and the doors slid open. To my shock, the man who\u2019d been manning the elevator controls the last few days was gone. Instead, the young man who we\u2019d been waiting to return was running the controls. Paula and I shared a surprised look, then both entered the elevator quickly. According to Arthur, the kid shouldn\u2019t have been working again until tomorrow. *I don\u2019t know, maybe he came back on a day early to cover someone else\u2019s shift or something*, I thought to myself. *Who cares, anyways? This is your chance to talk to him!*\r  \n\r  \nThe doors closed, and the elevator began its climb up to our floor. I waited for a few seconds before turning to the man. \u201cUh, \u2018scuse me?\u201d I said. The man turned to look at me, and after a few seconds, his blank look was replaced with one of recognition. \u201cAh, hello you two!\u201d he said cheerfully, \u201cI see you managed to wrangle yourself up some normal looking clothes, huh? Have you two enjoyed your time here?\u201d Both of us nodded. \u201cYes, we did, thank you for asking\u201d I said, then pressed on before he could say anything. \u201cLook, you said you\u2019ve seen others like us before, right? People who seem out of place, dressed funny and all that?\u201d The man nodded. \u201cYes, sir. Ever since I started working here three or four years ago, every once in a while we\u2019ll get, well, pardon my saying so, but odd looking folks showing up occasionally. Management told me it\u2019s happened ever since this place opened seven years ago\u201d \r  \n\r  \nI felt a pang of surprise shoot through me. *Ever since seven years ago\u20261955? People have accidentally wound up in the past from the present for that long? But\u2026why did no one ever say anything about it?* Another thought crossed my mind, one which worried me. *Maybe they were never able to get back*. I pushed that thought away; I needed to keep my head to keep asking the man questions. But Paula jumped in before I could open my mouth again. \u201cWell, we just wanted to know\u2026what happened to them? How long did they stay here? Did they check out and drive off like everyone else?\u201d The man rubbed his chin as he thought. \u201cHonestly, ma\u2019am, I can\u2019t answer *all* of those questions. I only work the elevators\u201d *Shit*. I saw a look of disappointment fall over Paula\u2019s features. But then the man continued.\r  \n\r  \n\u201c*However*, I do know that many of them stayed only a week or two at most. Fourteen days was the longest I saw any of them stay. I did ask the management a time or two the same questions you asked me. And I always was told they did check out and left. The guys running the valet always told me their odd looking cars always left the parking lot. So, I can only assume that they *did* drive away\u201d Now he gave us a bit of a puzzled look. \u201cIf I may be so bold as to ask, why did you want to know?\u201d Paula and I quickly exchanged a look. Both of us immediately realized we\u2019d accidentally walked into a situation we couldn\u2019t easily explain away. Especially with our specific questions. She shrugged at me as if to say *I don\u2019t know what to say to that*.\r  \n\r  \nFor a second, I mulled over our options in my head, trying to decide what to do. But then, a single thought swam forward. *The hell with it. It\u2019s time to come clean*. I turned to the man. \u201cTo be honest sir, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019d believe me if we told you the true reason we asked them\u201d I felt my wife grab my forearm, hard. The elevator operator raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try me?\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard all sorts of wild things in my time here. How wilder could what you say be than all of it?\u201d Paula tugged on my arm harder. \u201cDanny, *don\u2019t*, we don\u2019t know what\u2019ll happen if we tell someone the truth!\u201d I turned to her. \u201cPaula, this may the only way to find out how to get back\u201d I said quietly, \u201cAs long as we only tell one person, I think we\u2019ll be okay\u201d She bit her lip apprehensively, but eventually nodded. I returned the gesture, then turned to the man to my right to start talking.\r  \n\r  \nAnd then the elevator\u2019s lights went out again, plunging us into almost pitch blackness. Instantly, my heart began to pound furiously in my chest as the memory I tried so desperately hard to push away surged forward, memories of appearing alone and being chased by the black clad figures. But this time was different. I could still hear Paula breathing, now in a slightly panicked, shallow way. I felt her grab onto my arm, and a slight amount of relief passed through me. \u201cStupid piece of junk\u201d I heard the elevator operator mutter to my right, and then he raised his voice. \u201cJust give me a moment, you two. This happens every once in a while\u201d I heard him step away and begin to fumble with something. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, sweetheart\u201d I whispered to Paula as I felt her press against my side.\r  \n\r  \nBefore she had a chance to reply, though, another sound reached us. I couldn\u2019t tell what it was exactly, or where in the elevator it came from. But it made my already anxiety ridden mind swirl with nightmarish images. Images of a black clad figure raising an axe to plunge into my skull. *Please, God no, Please, God no* I began mentally whispering. A moment later, my prayers seemed to be answered as the lights came back on and the elevator began to move upwards again. I let out a breath I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d been holding in and turned to my wife. \u201cSee, we\u2019re okay\u201d I said, smiling at her. Her blue eyes locked with mine, and she returned the smile.\r  \n\r  \nBut only for a moment.\r  \n\r  \nI watched her eyes slide away from me and look somewhere behind me. I saw her face suddenly turn pale, and a look of utter terror slide over her features like a mask. She began breathing rapidly and backed up until her back was against the elevator wall. A colossal tidal wave of fear and dread surged through me at her reaction. I was beyond terrified to turn around. The woman was someone who didn\u2019t scare easily, a quality of hers I always loved. So, to see her like this, only meant something horrible was now behind me. But I knew whether or not I wanted to, I *had* to look. Swallowing hard, I slowly turned around. \r  \n\r  \nIt only took a split second to notice the two things she had seen. The first was that the elevator operator lay on the floor of the elevator on his back. His arms and legs were splayed out, and for a moment, I feared the worst. But then I saw his chest rise and fall, and realized he was merely unconscious. The realization brought a microsecond of comfort and relief to me. But it was shattered by the second detail, which made me rapidly back up to stand just in front of my wife, arms protectively held out as if to shield her.\r  \n\r  \nWe were no longer alone in the elevator.\r  \n\r  \nA massive figure in a black coat and hat, one which had been tipped down to hide the wearer\u2019s face stood almost exactly where I\u2019d last seen the operator. Whoever it was had to be at least 6\u20194 or taller. It was perfectly still and unmoving as the elevator continued towards our floor. To make matters worse, I couldn\u2019t hear the figure breathing, which sent another lightning bolt of fear coursing through me. I shot the floor indicator over the doors a quick sidelong glance, seeing we were only three floors away from ours.\r  \n \r  \nAnd then, as the last floor passed, it spoke.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cGood evening, Mr. and Mrs. Clements\u201d It was clearly a man, one who spoke with a deep, gravelly voice as though he\u2019d smoked two or three packs of cigarettes a day for years. My heart practically *stopped*. *Our names\u2026they know our fucking names\u2026* \u201cWhat\u2026.the fuck\u2026?\u201d I heard Paula breathe out behind me. Her words apparently amused the man, because he began to let out a chuckle, one which sounded like nails on a chalkboard. \u201cYes. *What* the fuck, indeed\u201d he muttered, raising his hat just enough for us to see he wore a truly wicked smile, but not enough to see his eyes. I felt the elevator come to a stop as it reached our floor. I remained where I was, but I slowly reached my hand behind me for Paula\u2019s. *We have only one shot to get out of this elevator alive*. Thankfully, I felt her grab it a moment later. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat the *fuck* do you people want?\u201d I finally demanded. For a few seconds, there was silence, until I heard the elevator *ding*. And then, the figure spoke, all trace of humor gone from his voice. \u201cI think you know, Mr. Clements\u201d he said. *Oh, shit\u2026*\r  \n\r  \nBefore I had another moment to think, the figure suddenly turned and lunged for us, letting out a cry. A cry I\u2019d heard before; it was the same voice I\u2019d heard from the black clad figure last week.\r  \nBut I\u2019d already anticipated the man\u2019s lunge and had been lying in wait. The second he exploded into motion, so did I. The biggest saving grace for us was that the elevator doors had begun to open as the man had spoken, and provided us an avenue to escape. I pulled hard on Paula\u2019s arm, practically shoving her out of the elevator ahead of me into the hall. The man tried to course correct as we dodged his attack, but he was far too tall to do so at the very last moment. He crashed headfirst into the wall of the elevator with a rather sickening *crunch* of wood paneling and fell to the floor, his hat tumbling off his head and revealing his identity to us. I heard Paula let out a gasp as she stumbled to her feet.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThe fucking *bellhop*?!\u201d she almost screamed. Indeed, the man who turned to look up at us with a mixture of frustration and hatred was the same bellhop who\u2019d pulled our luggage from the trunk of my car the night we\u2019d arrived. *You gotta be fucking kidding\u2026* But I had no time to think anything more beyond that. The man had begun to scramble to his feet. I dashed forward again, reaching around the inside corner of the elevator with a frantically searching hand. The raised round edges of the floor buttons met my fingers, and I slammed my palm down, hitting as many of them as I could. The elevator let out another *ding*, and I leapt backwards as the doors rapidly closed. The man leapt for us, but a second too late; we both heard him slam into the closed doors and scream out in frustration. It was the same \u201cGah!\u201d he\u2019d made when I\u2019d dodged him in the black, empty version of the hotel.\r  \n\r  \nThe thought suddenly made me whirl around. I feared I\u2019d suddenly see nothing but darkness around us, that we\u2019d been sent to that hellish alternate version when the lights in the elevator had gone out. To my relief, however, I saw only the same regular hallway we\u2019d become well accustomed to the last eleven days. As I stared, I saw a door open down the hall and a sleepy, annoyed man poke his head out of the room. \u201cKeep it down, will ya? I\u2019ll call security if you keep that damn racket up\u201d he said, then slammed the door shut. Paula and I exchanged a look, and then dashed for our room. Jamming the key into the lock, I practically wrenched the door open, then slammed it shut behind us and locked it. Finally, I grabbed one of the sturdy chairs from the sitting area, and wedged it under the doorknob. I knew it wouldn\u2019t keep anyone out for long, especially if they really wanted to get in here, but at least it would give us a warning.\r  \n\r  \nI turned around to find Paula staring at me. \u201cYou recognized his voice\u201d she whispered simply, \u201cI saw the look on your face. You recognized it\u201d For a moment, I was unsure about what to say. But I knew I couldn\u2019t hide anything from her anymore. Not where things had now progressed to her being in danger. *I should\u2019ve told her from the start*. So, I brought her over to the couch and sat her down, and proceeded to tell her everything. From exactly what had happened in the parking lot the first night we\u2019d arrived, to the nightmare hotel I\u2019d experienced the second day. And about the figures which had followed us the entire time we\u2019d been out and about. I saw a mixture of fear and anger cross her face as I told her. I knew she was upset at me for not telling her sooner. But, happily, she held back on giving me a tongue lashing.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSo, what do we do now?\u201d she asked after I\u2019d finished, her voice shaking slightly. I shook my head. \u201cI can only think of one thing to do\u201d She looked at me. \u201cCall down to reception, have them call the cops, and\u2026tell them\u2026well, not tell where we\u2019re from, but that we\u2019ve been followed and attacked. In a way they\u2019ll believe. We can\u2019t deal with this on our own anymore\u201d She began to play furiously with her hair and stayed silent for a few seconds, then slowly nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We *can\u2019t* deal with this alone\u201d She locked eyes with me, \u201c*But*, while we wait for them to arrive, you and I are going to have a serious talk about hiding things from each other from now on\u201d I sighed and nodded; I fully deserved what was about to come my way. \u201cAlright, let me call downstairs\u201d I said.\r  \n\r  \nCrossing to the bed, I sat on the edge and picked up the handset from the phone\u2019s cradle. Punching in the single number for the front desk, I heard it begin ringing. After the third ring, the line was picked up. \u201cHello?\u201d Instantly, I felt a wave of relief flash through me. It was Arthur. *I never thought I\u2019d be so happy to hear another man\u2019s voice.* \u201cArthur, this is Danny Clements in room 614\u201d I said quickly. \u201cAh, Mr. Clements, I hope you and your wife enjoyed Ms. Dors\u2019 last show!\u201d he said jovially. \u201cYes, we did, thank you very much\u201d I said, \u201cBut, I need to urgently speak to you\u201d The jovialness seemed to deflate out of Arthur\u2019s voice immediately. \u201cWhy, whatever\u2019s the matter, young man?\u201d he asked, his voice filled with concern. \u201cWe were just attacked in the elevator up to our room by one of your bellhops, the one who brought our luggage inside the night we arrived\u201d I heard the man let out a surprised breath on his end of the line.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMy, my, that\u2019s serious, Mr. Clements\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re not joking. Listen, Arthur, I hate to do this, but I need you to call the police. Have them come to our room right away, please\u201d A sudden dizzy spell struck me, and I put my free hand to my forehead to try and study myself. *I must be panicking too much, gotta stay calm.* But Arthur\u2019s next words almost seemed to intensify my dizzy spell. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to involve the police in such matters, Daniel\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI felt a wave of confusion and shock wash over me. \u201cEx-excuse me?\u201d I stammered out. Arthur\u2019s voice spoke again, seemingly more authoritative than I\u2019d ever heard it before. \u201cI said, I don\u2019t think we need to involve the police in such matters, Daniel. Not when we can solve them ourselves\u201d I stood up from the bed, feeling my legs almost give out from under me and the room seem to spin around me. \u201cThe *hell* are you talking about, Arthur?!\u201d I said weakly.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cExactly what I said twice, Daniel\u201d he said, then laughed softly before continuing, \u201cI thought you folks from the 21st Century were supposed to be *so* much smarter than us?\u201d The biggest surge of terror flooded through my veins at his words, seemingly quicker than everything else. *He knows\u2026?* \u201cI think, what you two need, is a good night\u2019s sleep. We\u2019ve already sent something up to help you do so, compliments of the management\u201d As his words reached my increasingly sluggish mind, I suddenly became aware of two things. The first was that Paula had collapsed onto the bed face first. For a moment, I feared she was dead. Then I realized, she was unconscious. The second, was that I heard the soft, hissing sound of something entering the room through the ventilation duct over the bed. *Gas\u2026sleeping gas\u2026or something\u2026.fuck\u2026*\r  \n\r  \nStill holding the receiver, I began moving towards the sliding door to the balcony. One which now seemed miles away. *I need to\u2026open it*. My legs gave out from under me, and I dropped to my knees on the carpet. Behind me, I heard the clattering sound of the phone\u2019s cradle toppling off the desk, and I fell onto my side on the floor. Darkness began to envelop the edges of my vision and rapidly move inwards.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhen you and your lovely wife wake up, you\u2019ll understand everything\u201d Arthur\u2019s voice, now filled with an almost sadistic tone filtered into my ears from what sounded like miles away, and he let out another laugh. It would become one I would hear often in my nightmares after we made it back, even months later. Blackness overcame me, and as I slipped away, I heard him say two final words in a mocking, sing-song manner.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSweet dreams!\u201d\n\n[Final](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13p5j02/my_wife_and_i_went_to_las_vegas_for_our_honeymoon/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)",

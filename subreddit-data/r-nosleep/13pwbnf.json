    "postText": "____\n\nIt ends me with me alone on top of a shattered elevator in a hellish pit. \n\nThe box that once held [several people](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13oxwkf/im_trapped_in_a_basement_elevator_alongside_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=15)now completely destroyed except for a few parts of the wall where the electrical panel is fried and the roof I\u2019m using as shelter. \n\nLike the elevator, my soul and spirit feel shattered and broken given what I have endured. \n\nIt is impossible to be certain how much time has past since the maintenance man died. \n\nMy phone is at a measly 8% and the charger I once had is long gone. \n\nI feel the need to scream, angry at what this place has done to me and the others that were with me. \n\nI repeatedly check my notes to remember their names. \n\nSidney. Amanda. Phil. Nick. Chlo\u00e9. The little girl. \n\nI\u2019ve forgotten all of them, I realize in desperation as I occasionally look through the open hatch to the void below. \n\nI had hoped with the monster dead my memories would return. But soon I discovered that there are still remnants of it around me. \n\nI first felt the need to get a good look at the roof when I heard what sounded like breathing. It was so dark I couldn\u2019t see my hand in front of my face so I activated the light on my phone and saw something that made me gasp in horror.\n\nLong pulsing meshes of strange goop that resemble cocoons line the roof of the elevator in different spots. All of them having strange dark shapes swim and form in their gestating sacs as I examine the horrid scene. \nI do not dare imagine what is within these pods as I \n push my body a little toward the edge of the roof and try to keep my breathing steady. \n\nThese must be the offspring of that monster, I realize as I see one of the pods was partially broken apart and purple mist occasionally spits out into the air. I make sure to not get anywhere near it. \n\nI can\u2019t get too close to the wall either to avoid my skin scraping against it, so I\u2019m in an awkward position trying to figure out whether any spot on this roof is safe. \n\nI shine the light toward the wall and notice something that I couldn\u2019t see before. \n\nIt\u2019s on the opposite side and it resembles some kind of box jutting out of the frame next to the rail that constantly lets the elevator rise. There is just enough room on that side of the cage for the box to slide by and disappear into the void and I\u2019m puzzled by what it could have been. \n\nIt\u2019s at that point I realize that I didn\u2019t really pay attention to the walls and I keep the light focused there to see what else might have been hidden in the darkness. \n\nA short time later I notice chalk paint against the cement and it\u2019s forming symbols. A number and a letter. \n\nB3. \n\nMy heart skips a beat and I try to see if I can find any illumination from the lobby. Have I almost reached the surface? \n\nI turn back to the wall to watch it crawl by and see something else not too long after that. \n\nAnother box. This time I can tell there is emergency equipment inside of it. A fire hose and a fire ax, something that rescuers would use to attempt to rescue people trapped here. \n\nI move over carefully toward the wall but I don\u2019t make it there before this box disappears as the elevator continues it\u2019s upward crawl. \n\nI told myself not to get hopeful but I can\u2019t help it. The thought of this nightmare finally being over is enough to make me cry. \n\nMy phone buzzes and I notice it only has 4% of life left. For some reason I choose to ignore that and keep the light trained on the wall. I am eager to see the next chalked floor number as it gradually approaches. \n\nMy eyes squint and I find myself confused by what is painted on the elevator wall. \n\nB3. \n\nI don\u2019t let it fully sink in until about fifteen minutes later when the next chalk pattern crawls by and it\u2019s the same numbers again. \n\nThen like clockwork I see the emergency equipment. \n\nAnd then again fifteen minutes later the same pattern. \n\nAgain. And again. \n\n\u201cI told you, all of this is meaningless,\u201d a voice echoes across the roof. \n\nI snap to attention and find myself staring at the army private what little of him I can remember. \n\n\u201cYou should have taken my offer when you still had a chance,\u201d he says as he plays with his service pistol. \n\nHe puts it against his head and before I can even look away, the gun goes off, blowing apart half of his face. \n\nHe remains sitting there, unfazed by the brutal act of violence as I realize what is now happening to me. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not real. I\u2019m\u2026 I'm hallucinating from lack of sleep, water and food,\u201d I mumble as I try to look away from the hole in his head. \n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m real or not. You know what I\u2019m saying is true. This whole damn situation has just been an exercise in futility,\u201d the hallucination tells me as it points the gun toward the chalk paint that crawls by. \n\n\u201cYou are never going to get out of here. Which means all of them died for nothing,\u201d he cackles. \n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d I snap as I force my eyes closed. I can\u2019t even keep the voice away there as I hear his words rattle in my brain. \n\n\u201cThat monster is going to devour you and then sink back to hell and every last shred of your memory will be gone. No one will even know you were ever here,\u201d it says. \n\nMy hands tremble as I slam my fists against the roof. \n\n\u201cDo you even know who you are anymore?\u201d the voice asks. \n\nI don\u2019t have the power to admit that I have forgotten. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t, do you? You\u2019re just a stranger in a nightmare that will never end. So what does it matter if you live or die? Who will ever know or care?\u201d It hisses. \n\nI open my eyes and I can see the hatch where the void calls to me below. The voice is telling me to give up. \n\n\u201cThey matter,\u201d I say, standing up and looking at the wall where the hallucination once was. \n\n\u201cI am going to make it out of here for them,\u201d I tell my inner demons. \n\nThere is no response this time. For the moment I have a small victory. But I see the chalked number crawl again and I feel my heart sink. This creature has still exerted its influence over me and kept me here trapped from the surface. \n\nMy first guess is that it must be whatever is inside the cocoons and I decide that I have to destroy them. \n\nMoving toward the side of the wall where the box moved by, I use the short time I have to reach for it and smash the glass, grabbing the ax. \n\nI hold it firmly and slam the blade down on the first writhing mass of goo, making whatever is inside wail in pain. \n\nThe shriek causes the others to begin to pulse and then ripple open. I see strange forms begin to emerge from the cocoons that almost resemble people. \n\nNone of them have faces. \n\nThe newly spawned demons begin to move toward me and I slam the ax down against them over and over, hacking away at their misshapen bodies. \n\nOne of them starts to claw at me and I feel my body being pushed against the rising wall. \n\nDropping the ax, I use what little strength I have to push it toward the open hatch and listen to it scream as it plummets. There are a few still left. \n\nOne of them picks up the ax, swinging it toward me violently and hitting an artery in my shoulder. The only thing pushing me forward right now is the human spirit and the sacrifice of others. \n\nI slam my head against the monster and pull the ax away, slicing its head clean off. \n\nThe last monster stands ready to tackle me, its long snake-like arms bending  impossibly as it stretches its new body to attempt to swallow me whole. \n\n There is enough time for me to smash the ax against the elevator roof itself near the hatch. It\u2019s been barely hanging on for hours now and this final push causes the entire roof to groan and bend. The monster falls into the newly created hole, desperately clawing at me one last time before it too is swallowed by the void. \n\nIn the same instance, what\u2019s left of the elevator roofs groans again and I brace for the fall. \n\nInstead everything simply stops again and I sigh in relief. The monsters are gone and for the moment I am still alive. \n\nThen I look toward the other side of the wall where the paint is etched in the cement and I see something that gives me a final push to keep fighting. \n\nB2. \n\nI stare at it a moment longer to be sure I am not hallucinating this. With the nightmarish creatures gone, I have broken the spatial cycle and the elevator is almost near ground level. \n\nBut it is pointless to celebrate as I realize the fight against the unknown has halted the progress of my rise. I will be trapped here. \n\nNo. No, I can't think like this. I haven\u2019t come this far to be forgotten now. \n\nI push myself over toward the hatch to get a look at the broken electrical panel and I see there is some faint sparks between the wires. Whatever the maintenance man did some time ago has simply stopped working. I have to find a way to make sure I keep going up. \n\nThe box where I found the ax is within reach and I tug at the fire hose, pulling it all down onto the roof of the elevator. \n\nTying it around my waist I tug as hard as I can to be sure the hose will hold my weight. \n\nOnce I am sure that I can make it safely, I descend from the broken hatch to the void. \n\nI have nothing holding me except the taut fire hose and it feels unreal to dangle above an endless chasm. But I can\u2019t focus on that. I push my weight back and forth gingerly to swing toward the electrical panel. The strain is a lot for me and it feels like I could fall to the void at any moment. \n\nAt last my hand latches ahold of the broken panel and I reach for the two wires. I have no idea if this will work or not, but at this point I have nothing left to lose. \n\nThe elevator makes a noise and the roof begins to go up slowly again. \n\nI let go of the panel and pull up on the rope, knowing I have only a few seconds to grab ahold of the roof before it leaves without me. My body feels heavier than it ever has before and I am scrambling to find something to latch onto. \n\nTugging up again, I grab at the broken hatch, the deep metal making my hands gush with blood but I push through the pain and force myself up and over. \n\nThe fire hose is still tied to my waist but I have to let it go or risk being sucked below as the box disappears so I cut it loose with the ax. \n\nThen I collapse into what is left of the goo as the elevator crawls past level B2. \n\nA short time later, I see the chalk outline for B1 and Iay there, excited for what is to come. \n\nI can see the outline of a door. The safety door to this level, just barely above me. \n\nI am almost free from this hell. \n\nThe roof shutters and groans and slows down. \n\nThe door is almost within reach. \n\nThen the elevator stops. \n\nI close my eyes, trying my best not to panic. \n\nBut it does little good. \n\nThe elevator does not move again, nor will it ever move. \n\nI scream at the top of my lungs, standing up and reaching as high up as I can for the door. My fingers can just barely touch the bottom of the frame. \n\nEscape is just out of my reach. \n\n\u201cHelp!!!\u201d I scream as I bang my fist against the wall, hoping that there is someone on the other side of that door who hears me. But my words just echo into the emptiness. \n\nI keep doing that for the next hour until I am unable to scream. I\u2019ve lost my voice. \n\nI slump down to the roof of the elevator, curling my legs up toward my body and begin to shake with despair. \n\nI\u2019m never getting out of here. The soldier was right. I fought as hard as I could and this is the end of the line. \n\nI pull my cell phone out, looking at the cracked screen. I have full signal now, not the occasional like had for days but it matters very little because it\u2019s sitting at 2%. Not enough time to plan a rescue even if I knew where I was. \n\nA final desperate solution forms in my broken mind. \n\nI grab the ax and turn to the door, reaching on my tiptoes to pry it open with the ax, just barely enough for a small object to slide through. \n\nI am going to stand on my tiptoes and slide this phone through that opening in the vain hope that someone will find it and rescue me. \n\nI doubt I will be alive much longer with no food or water so I won\u2019t waste time taking note of my demise and simply say goodbye. \n\nIf this makes it out, it means that they found me or my corpse. \n\nEither way, the story of our struggle in this hell will be found and told. \n\n_________\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE\n\nI woke in a hospital bed with burns and blood all over my body. \n\nMy nurse told me that an urban explorer found this dead cell phone next to an old abandoned elevator in a sub basement. \n\nI had no idea what is inside, but I saw several posts relating to an elevator. I\u2019m going to read them now and try to sort through this. \n\nUPDATE\n\nI\u2019ve thought a lot about what I found since then, trying to make sense of it. \n\nTrying to come to terms with what any of it means. \n\nI have no idea what any of these people actually looked like or what sort of lives they led. To me, they really are strangers. \n\nBut then I came to realize that all of us are strangers to each other in one way or another. \n\nSomewhere, on a sunny morning, a man like me will be trying to not be late for a job interview.\n\nA  businesswoman will be busy dropping her kids off at school and promising them they will go to the museum afterward.\n\nA maintenance man will be trying to make it through the day when he wasn\u2019t even supposed to come to work.\n\nA young army private could be planning to take his own life, or maybe he finds himself second guessing over and over again as he enters the building that once meant so much to him.\n\nThere could be a young nurse who is just on her lunch break after a long graveyard shift. She runs across the street to meet her boyfriend in the cafeteria on the fourth floor.\n\nOr a deaf woman is checking her notes and preparing for another fulfilling day of work.\n\nEven a young girl who keeps asking her father to go play while he is busy tending to phone calls.\n\nThese people exist, just like the ones that were in these notes existed. \n\nOne by one those strangers enter that elevator. They do not know each other either. The young army soldier presses for the top floor, the others do the same for their destinations and the elevator door closes.\n\nThey probably exchange social norms and smile uncomfortably toward each other. No words are probably ever spoken.\n\nThen they would exit one by one to their different destinations. Never encountering one another again. Never knowing what might have been.\n\nInstead, Circumstances beyond our understanding trapped us in a hellish prison for days. We lost everything including our own sense of self. I don\u2019t know who I am, I don\u2019t remember any of this. I don\u2019t even know any of their last names or how to contact any of their family or friends. \n\nDoes that mean it was all meaningless?\n\nDoes that mean their memory is gone now? \n\nDoes that mean they never mattered at all?\n\nDo any of us really matter in the grand scheme of things? \n\nOr are we simply all strangers trapped in nightmares that the universe has created, being constantly devoured by the passage of time and forgotten by the same savage force?\n\nI can\u2019t answer these terrifying questions. And it\u2019s possible that no one can. \n\nBut I think it\u2019s important we ask them and keep their memory alive.  \n\nOtherwise we may never become more than strangers searching for answers to questions the universe couldn\u2019t care less about.",

Crazy how you get in an elevator in a building that you know and yet somehow end up in somewhere abandoned that an urban explorer just so happens to stumble upon. Really makes me wonder if you're even in the same dimension anymore, or how you managed to slip through the cracks and end up in some random building's elevator shaft. I'm assuming that it was abandoned and it wasn't the building you started in because of the urban explorer bit. They don't usually explore occupied buildings",

    "postText": "There\u2019s a saying in my hometown: *\u201cNobody leaves Copper Hill for good.\u201d*\n \nFor years, I\u2019d mostly managed to defy it. In the decade that followed my graduation from Copper Hill High School, I hardly set foot in its vicinity.\n \nInstead, I absorbed myself in my studies at an out-of-state university and, eventually, my career. I spent the little free time I had with my girlfriend, who I\u2019d met as a sophomore in a chemistry lab, and her friends. When we eventually broke up, I lost not only her, but also what little social life I had.\n \nIt was in this state of loneliness that I found a letter from my old high school in the mail. This surprised me, as I hadn\u2019t realized that anyone there even knew my current mailing address.\n \nI opened the envelope to find an invitation inside. Its design was fancier than I\u2019d expected, complete with gold-colored glitter, a royal blue background, and a finely-drawn silver border. It read, in cursive letters: *Cheers for 10 Years! Zachary R. ___, Please Join Us for the CHHS Class of 2013 Official Reunion.* It went on to list a start time and the school\u2019s address.\n \nOn its back, it even contained a personalized handwritten note: *I know you live far away, Zach, but it would mean so much to me if you can make the trip. Paul and I will be there, and Arthur may fly in as well. I\u2019d love to catch up! Hope to see you soon \u2013 Vince K___, Co-Chair, CHHS Reunion Planning Committee.*\n \nVince had been one of my best friends, once. You see, Copper Hill is one of those rare small towns where you can easily graduate from high school alongside the same friends you first made in kindergarten \u2013 in my case, my buddies Arthur, Paul, and Vince.\n \nI\u2019d spent most of my youth with them. The four of us were in the same scout troop, played on the same sports teams, and took mostly the same classes. On weekends \u2013 and on weeknights, when we felt like sneaking out without permission \u2013 we often stayed up late together playing video games and drinking whatever cheap beer we managed to keep hidden from our parents.\n \nWe\u2019d meant so much to each other once. So why, since graduation, had I neglected them so badly? I couldn\u2019t even remember the last time I\u2019d talked to any of them.\n \nPerhaps this reunion could serve as an opportunity for me to reignite friendships I\u2019d let fade. At a minimum, I knew that spending time \u2013 even just one evening \u2013 with my old pals would do me a lot of good, especially considering how lonely I\u2019d been lately. Accordingly, I resolved to attend. \n \n~\n \nBy the time I reached Copper Hill, I was an hour behind schedule due to congestion caused by an accident. As I approached town, I observed amidst the fading evening light that it appeared even quieter and more deserted than I remembered. Bars that had reliably drawn decent crowds on a Friday night ranged from boarded-up to barely occupied. Meanwhile, the few other cars on the street drove lethargically at speeds far below the limit, and I spotted no pedestrians.\n \nIn my memory, the school was only a short distance from the courthouse, city hall, and post office that formed most of \u2018downtown,\u2019 but my GPS took me down a long, unfamiliar route bordered on both sides by tall cornfields. I was about to pull over and double-check the address I\u2019d entered when, sure enough, my headlights illuminated a sign in the school\u2019s distinct black and red colors that stated: *CHHS: Home of the Patriots.*\n \nThe brick building that loomed behind it was just as I remembered, from its tall, towering middle section to the two narrower wings that stretched out to the left and right. Through the rectangular windows that lined the main building, I made out indistinct, shadowy figures milling about inside.\n \nA banner displaying *Welcome \u2013 10 Years \u2013 CHHS Reunion* stretched over the stairs that led to the main entrance. Underneath it, a familiar figure scurried towards the main entrance. \u201cArthur,\u201d I said to myself with a smile.\n \nSeeing Arthur improved my mood. He was the only other member of our class to leave town after graduation, and I suspected that he might share somewhat of an outsider status with me.\n \n*It\u2019ll be just like old times,* I reassured myself as I approached the building. Strangely, though, it still didn\u2019t *feel* that way.\n \nFor one, the air had a staleness to it that was difficult to describe. It felt artificial and thin such that, as I climbed the front steps, I found myself needing to breathe in more of it than usual to avoid getting winded.\n \nPlus, the school\u2019s location still seemed *off* somehow. It didn\u2019t make any sense \u2013 it\u2019s not like a building this large could have been relocated. But, amidst the eerily quiet surrounding countryside, everything felt more isolated and remote than I remembered it being.\n \nI tried to stop worrying. After all, with any luck, I\u2019d soon be laughing and reminiscing with old friends who\u2019d be happy to see me.\n \nInside, balloon garlands, multicolored streamers, triangle flags, and small banners welcoming attendees decorated the main corridor. I observed tables stocked with snacks, pamphlets, and information about fundraisers.\n \nThe only noise came from the intercom, which planned an era-appropriate Calvin Harris song. Everything necessary for a reunion was there, with only one notable exception: the people.\n \nAs I approached an unmanned table marked \u201cCheck In,\u201d I wondered where everybody had gone. Perhaps the event had moved to a different room? I was late, after all.\n \nAs I added my signature to a sign-in sheet, my eyes scanned the list of other attendees who were marked as having already arrived. I recognized many names on it.\n \nLike Alice, who\u2019d shared a stand with me in orchestra. Our conductor was a hard-ass, a real disciplinarian who snapped at us constantly, and Alice was one of the many students he\u2019d driven to tears on a semi-regular basis.\n \nI\u2019d had this petty fantasy of comforting her after class, and then mustering the courage to ask her out. But I never did it. It was Vince, actually, who\u2019d ended up with her.\n \nThat had always annoyed me. I\u2019d confided in Vince about how I felt about Alice and, soon after, the two of them were together. It felt as frustrating as it sounds. But, oh well, that\u2019s what I get for hesitating for as long as I did.\n \nDrifting down the hallway, my eyes caught the words \u201cReception\u201d displayed over double-doors that led to the gymnasium. It made sense as the main location for the event \u2013 that\u2019s where homecoming, prom, and plenty of major sports events were held, after all.\n \nI could hear chatter, laughter, and the loud thump of dance music just beyond the gym doors. I approached it excitedly. \n \nBut, when I stepped inside, all the noise instantly cut out, leaving me in an eerie silence. Even more perplexingly, the room before me, like the entrance corridor, was entirely devoid of people. \n \nA party had just been here, no doubt. I spotted a makeshift bar stocked with a standard assortment of liquor, tables holding half-finished drinks and refreshments, and an area cleared for a dance floor in the room\u2019s center, but there were no people around. Had I missed everyone again? Where had they gone?\n \n\u201cHello?\u201d I called out, to no avail, as I drifted around the room in a state of bewilderment.\n \nAs I did so, I came across the entrance to the boy\u2019s locker room. Just a whiff of the musty, sweaty smell emanating from it unlocked long-buried memories of the time I\u2019d spent in there.\n \nI remembered one occasion, in particular, where Paul had gotten *pissed* at me. Paul was usually a pretty low-key guy, but when he lost it, he went *wild*. On that particular occasion, he\u2019d been angry with *me*, hadn\u2019t he? But why?\n \nI recalled his hot breath as he got in my face and screamed at me. When I gently nudged him away, he responded by slamming a locker door into my head.\n \nMy memories from that moment forward were hazy. There was a growing pool of blood, the pain of his fist against my cheek, and the cheering of the classmates who had encircled us. They were egging us on to continue the \u2018fight,\u2019 as if my beating could be called that.\n \nI hadn\u2019t thought about this event in years. How could I have forgotten something like that? My mind churned in confusion. Feeling dizzy, I took a seat on a bench that appeared to be part of a crude photobooth setup as my mind continued to replay this repressed memory.\n \nAs Paul had continued to pummel me, I\u2019d spotted Vince among the gathered crowd. I\u2019d begged for him to intervene. But neither he, nor our strangely absent instructor, had done anything to help me. It was only when Arthur got between us that Paul had reluctantly cooled off.\n \nIt had taken weeks for those bruises to heal. Had Paul ever been punished for it, or even apologized? Surely he must have. We\u2019d remained friends, after all.\n \nA strange pressure around my shoulder and a sudden bright light jolted me back to the present. The flash on the camera facing the bench I was sitting on had\u2026gone off, somehow, even with nobody around to operate it. How was that possible? Maybe it was automated to go off every so often?\n \nIt didn\u2019t make sense, just like so much else that was happening. Where was everybody, and whose voices had I been hearing? I\u2019d seen people from the road, and I\u2019d even watched Arthur come inside, but, as far as I could tell, the event was deserted.\n \nI texted Arthur asking if he\u2019d found anyone. For all I knew, he could have changed his number in the many years that had gone by since I\u2019d last used it, but I figured it was worth a shot. To my relief, he responded right away.\n \n*Hey man, long time no see! Paul just called me. He says everyone\u2019s up on the third floor, in Mr. Minelli\u2019s old room. I\u2019m on my way there now. Meet you there soon.*\n \nI couldn\u2019t fathom why the entire event would relocate from the area clearly designated for it to the third floor. There wasn\u2019t much up there, after all, aside from classrooms and a few administrative officers.\n \nNonetheless, I resolved to head up there. Arthur was there, after all, and hopefully the rest of my friends would be as well.\n \nNavigating off my memory of the building\u2019s layout, I hopped up a small set of steps that connected the gym to the second floor. From there, it would just be a short walk past a few classrooms before I\u2019d arrive at the central staircase, which would take me to my destination.\n \nI\u2019d never seen the school quite this gloomy before. Each footstep echoed through the halls. The classrooms were weirdly empty, too, bereft of any decorations or other signs of use.\n \nI recognized one as my calculus classroom. I remembered how, after class had ended one day, I\u2019d come across a group of students congregating in the hallway.\n \nMary, Michelle, and Abby, like so many of my classmates, had grown up with me, and I\u2019d always gotten along with them. But that day, they were harassing a shy girl \u2013 Morgan, I think. Calling her all sorts of names \u2013 \u2018slut,\u2019 \u2018whore,\u2019 \u2018bitch\u2019. She was trying to get away from them, but they wouldn\u2019t let her leave. Their taunting of her became a regular thing, and it often left Morgan in tears.\n \nWhat ever happened to Morgan? Like most of my friends, I\u2019d known her since I was a little kid. She was quiet, but she was perfectly nice.\n \nThen, one day, gossip about her started to spread. The type of nasty, embellished rumors that often make their way through high schools, full of sexist undertones and double standards. Her former friends shunned her, and she\u2019d been subjected to taunting and ridicule as she walked to class and sat alone at lunch. And, one day, she was just\u2026gone. I\u2019d always assumed that her family had moved away, but was that *true*?\n \nGrowing up, Mary, Michelle, and Abby had always been sweet girls. I\u2019d never seen them treat another person the way they\u2019d treated Morgan. But Copper Hill High School had a way of bringing out the worst in people. There was just something about this building, this place, that ate away at their \u2013 at *our* \u2013 souls.\n \nHad I bullied Morgan, too? Maybe not, but, once her mistreatment started, it\u2019s not like I\u2019d made an effort to be kind to her, or ever invited her to sit with me and my friends in the cafeteria. I could have done more.\n \nI reached the central staircase. With each step that I took up towards the third floor, a feeling of dread ran through me. I\u2019d seen something terrible happen up here, hadn\u2019t I?\n \nIt was Paul and Vince. Arthur had done something to offend them. It could have been the rumors spreading about his reasons for never having a girlfriend, his diminutive size, or the way he\u2019d reacted when Paul had beaten me half to death.\n \nWhatever the reason, Paul and Vince \u2013 without my knowledge \u2013 had decided to subject Arthur to a cruel prank. After school one day, they\u2019d lured Arthur up to the third floor, where they\u2019d taken hold of him and tried to wedge him into his own locker.\n \nNow, there\u2019s a reason this sort of thing occurs primarily on 90s sitcoms: most people simply can\u2019t fit inside of a locker. Arthur, as short and skinny as he was, turned out to be no exception, but this only made things worse for him.\n \nAs Arthur later related to me, Paul and Vince laughed rowdily as they slammed him repeatedly into the metal frame. By the time they finally relented, Arthur had bruises all over his body.\n \nThere were other horrible acts, too. Other victims, other beatings. It dawned on me that this place had been an absolute hellhole. It\u2019s no wonder I \u2013 and Arthur, too \u2013 had gotten as far away from it as we could at the first opportunity.\n \nThe peculiar thing was that, in the years that had passed, I\u2019d somehow forgotten all of this until just now. Instead, my recollections of high school were all happy, all positive. Had false memories of camaraderie and friendship drawn Arthur back as well?\n \nFinally, I reached the third level. The overhead fluorescent light fixtures flickered sporadically, revealing, in brief spurts, dilapidated lockers, litter, and layers of dust and dirt that coated the floor.\n \nI approached Mr. Minelli\u2019s classroom. Through the shaded hallway window, I could discern the outlines of roughly a dozen figures inside. I heard a voice, too. It was muffled and indistinct, but I could tell that the speaker was giving some kind of speech. She stopped, and a loud round of applause followed.\n \nI reached for the door handle, unsure of what to expect. Hopefully, it would just be the people I\u2019d driven four hours to see. But, after the events thus far, I half-expected the room to be empty. If so, I was jumping ship and going home.\n \nTo my surprise, just before I made contact with it, the door slowly opened on its own. The brightly-lit room before me was filled not with people, at least in the general understanding of the word. Rather, the still, bony forms before me resembled the kind of props a biology teacher might use to teach human anatomy.\n \nThe skeletons that stood silently throughout the room \u2013 that stood posed with drinks, that sat at desks, and that had assembled around a speaker - *had* to be props, right? Even though Mr. Minelli was a history teacher?\n \nMy mind searched desperately for some kind of explanation. This had to be an elaborate prank, right? Had Vince and Paul lured me, and maybe Arthur, too, out here just to freak us the fuck out? I wouldn\u2019t put it past them \u2013 it\u2019s precisely the kind of thing they\u2019d do, even if the whole set-up, complete with an array of prop skeletons, was a bit extreme.\n \nBut, then, who was making all the noises I\u2019d been hearing? Was that part of the prank, too?\n \n*Fuck it,* I thought. If this was a big gag at my expense, then I\u2019d just have to deal with the embarrassment later. I was getting out of there.\n \n\u201c*Zach*,\u201d called a strained voice in the hallway.\n \n\u201cIf this a joke, then it\u2019s not-\u201d\n \nThe voice interrupted me. \u201c*Zach, help me, please*!\u201d It was Arthur\u2019s voice, and it was coming from the hallway nearby.\n \nHe sounded like he was in serious trouble, so I hurried after him. Eventually, I found myself in a corner of the hallway \u2013 one where, if I remembered correctly, he and I used to have lockers. But, once again, I found myself alone.\n \nI yelled out his name several times: \u201c*Arthur! Arthur!*\u201d It was no use. I appeared to be at a dead end.\n \nThat\u2019s when the locker next to me shook. I jumped back, surprised.\n \nIt was shut, but not locked. I gripped the handle and pulled it open.\n \nNothing could have prepared me for what I saw inside: it was Arthur\u2019s *torso*. The rest of his body was *gone*, and something was dragging what was left of him further away, further back into a dark abyss where the wall should have been. \n \nBlood gurgled out of his mouth as he gasped my name one last time. He reached out a red-stained hand. Hoping to somehow pull him out, I tried to take it, only for whatever unseen force had taken hold of him to pull him away, leaving behind a wide hole in the back of the locker. More blood gushed through it, leaking onto the hallway floor.\n \n\u201c*So glad you could make it,*\u201d said a monotone voice behind me. I whirled around to see two fleshy arms emerge from another locker across from me. The skinless figure left wet, red stains on the white surface as she got to her feet and stepped towards me. \u201cDon\u2019t you recognize your old crush? Surely ten years haven\u2019t been that rough on me.\u201d\n \n\u201cA-alice?\u201d I stuttered, stepping backwards. \n \nLockers all around me started opening, each accompanied by a new pair of bloody, seemingly boneless arms of figures that slowly crawled outwards.\n \nMy survival instincts kicked in. I sprinted away, my legs frantically carrying me towards the main staircase. All around me, figures emerged, reaching out to me as I passed by. Through an open door, I noticed that another classroom was filled with skeletons, just as Mr. Minelli\u2019s had been.\n \nWhen I reached the main staircase, it was guarded by a tall, fleshy figure. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to be with us?\u201d it asked in a familiar, deep voice that I knew to be Paul\u2019s. \u201cWe can be complete. A full class. All of us, together again. Like old times.\u201d\n \nHe lurched for me. Just barely, I managed to dodge him, but I lost balance in the process.  Before I knew it, I was tumbling down the stairs. Pain shot through me as I collided with step after step.\n \nFinally, I landed on a level surface. Dizzily, I climbed to my feet and did my best to ignore the soreness that spread throughout my body.\n \nA quick glance upwards confirmed that the bloody figures \u2013 the ones that *somehow* resembled my old classmates \u2013 were, indeed, heading towards me.\n \nMeanwhile, the temperature inside was rising noticeably, and the walls around me were steadily changing in color from a dull gray to a deep red.\n \nAs I scrambled down the rest of the stairs and across the main corridor on the first floor, an intense tremor ran through the building, sending me sprawling to the ground. Despite a sharp pain that spread through my ankle, I hobbled as quickly as I could to the exit.\n \nI didn\u2019t look back as I made my way across the parking lot to my car. I started the ignition, backed out, and headed towards the long road I\u2019d used to get there.\n \nIn my rearview mirror, I chanced a glance back at the school. It was shaking violently, like it was being struck by an earthquake.\n\nMy car lurched in different directions as the ground underneath me also started to rumble. In an effort to avoid my car being sent off the road and into the neighboring fields, I frantically steered it to the center, between the lanes heading into and out of town.\n\nWhen I looked back again, the school was, somehow, even *closer* to me than it had been before. How was that possible? Was it *following* me?\n \nI floored the accelerator. Row after row of cornfield flew by me as I drove at the fastest speed of my life.\n \n~\n \nI was on the edge of town, close to the nearest interstate ramp, when local police pulled me over.\n \nAs the officer approached me, I stared into the rear view mirror. At the first glimpse of *whatever* it was that had chased after me, I\u2019d hit the road again, law enforcement be damned. In truth, I hadn\u2019t seen my pursuer since I\u2019d exited the cornfield a few minutes ago, but I hardly felt safe.\n \n\u201cClocked you going nearly a hundred, son,\u201d said the officer.\n \nI stayed silent. My baffled self was unsure of how to best handle the situation.\n \nThe officer gave me a quizzical look as he examined my ID and registration. \u201cYou\u2019re Don and Fran\u2019s son, aren\u2019t you? The one who left town?\u201d\n \nI nodded.\n \n\u201cWhy\u2019d you come back?\u201d \n \n\u201cThere was, uh, a ten-year reunion. For my graduating class.\u201d\n \nHe shook his head. \u201cI doubt that.\u201d He looked down, then at my perplexed face. \u201c*Where*, exactly, was this \u2018reunion\u2019?\u201d\n \n\u201cAt the school,\u201d I said. I struggled to understand his reaction. What about my story didn\u2019t make sense? And, regardless, was I about to be booked for driving fifty miles over the speed limit? Is that something they throw you in jail for?\n \n\u201cWait here,\u201d barked the officer. He went to his car where he proceeded to have a long conversation over his radio. After a few minutes, he returned to me. \u201cGet out of here, son. Leave, and don\u2019t come back. Don\u2019t do something like this again. You hear me?\u201d\n \n\u201cYeah, yeah, that\u2019s fine,\u201d I said, astonished.\n \n\u201cThen scram,\u201d he ordered.\n \nI obliged and began the long journey home.\n \n~ \n\nI had no idea what to make of what occurred. I can hardly find anything at all online about Copper Hill High, or any of my classmates who went there, and I\u2019m not exactly eager to reach out to any of them.\n \nI can\u2019t make much sense of what happened, but I am sure of one thing: that I barely made it out of that situation, and that I shouldn\u2019t press my luck much further.\n \nMy ankle needs some more time to heal. Once it does, I\u2019m going to try joining a social club and making new friends. After what happened to me in Copper Hill, I decided that the past is *not* a place where I need to dwell any longer.\n \nTwo weeks have passed since the reunion. Today, an envelope with no return address arrived with my mail. It contained a single photograph on glossy paper with a short note written underneath.\n \nThe image featured me on the bench in the photo booth. Sitting to my side, with his arm over my shoulders, was Vince. He wore a blue collared shirt and looked\u2026normal. No missing skin, no bloody imprints on the surface around him.\n\nPaul crouched behind us, a dopey grin on his face. He, too, looked just as I\u2019d imagined he would in his late twenties. To Paul\u2019s right, Abby, Morgan, and Michelle posed together with their arms around each other.\n\nIt was\u2026a perfectly ordinary image - the exact kind of photo you\u2019d expect to be taken at an event like that.\n \nThe handwritten caption underneath read, \u201c*Although your visit was briefer than we preferred, we all had a splendid time catching up with you, Zach! Please feel free to come by anytime! Nobody truly leaves Copper Hill, after all. \u2013 Vince K___, Co-Chair, CHHS Reunion Planning Committee.*\n \n*P.S.,* the note continued, *We are delighted that Arthur has finally joined us. Maybe you will, too, at our 20th.*\n\nThe writing up to this point was cursive font in traditional black ink. The last few words, however, were larger in size, messily scrawled, and colored a deep shade of red: *See you then, buddy, if not sooner.*\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeaceSim/)",

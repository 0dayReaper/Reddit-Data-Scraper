    "postText": "\nI woke up my head spinning to my tv blaring at me from its stand in the Corner of the room. It took me a few moments to recognize the message displayed on my tv said. \u201cEmergency alert system\u201d it said there was a \u201clunar anomaly\u201d it was odd because I memorized most of these type of signs and information but I\u2019ve never heard of one like this, what even is a \u201clunar anomaly\u201d. At the bottom it said it was at king place in my home town and a few other towns nearby. Starting at 2:45 am. Oh crap. I look at my phone clock 2:30. It said to took supplies, food, water , etc. and to go to any room with no windows. \n\n2:42 I locked myself in the bathroom grabbed quite a lot of food and water, a phone charger, my phone, and headphones. \n\n2:45 I got settled, and waited while watching my phone. \n\n2:47 a scream penetrated through the silence of the night. I flinched. Another scream. More and more screams joined the disturbing chorus. The screams were horrific. It sounded like they were boiling alive\n\n3:10 my phone started to glitch for about 5 minutes every once in a while, a message on flop up I would get to read the whole thing, but I only saw a picture of the moon\n\n3:24 the screaming stopped 10 minutes ago. I didn\u2019t dare go outside. whatever is out there, I wouldn\u2019t to see. \n\n\n7:56 I dozed off. Normally in my neighborhood. This time, birds would chirp, cars would drive through and dogs would bark but no. Silence. Complete silence.\n\n12:43 I decided to go out at two, that was short lived though when. Another person screamed. Probably thought whatever was happening was over. \n\n3:24 I haven\u2019t had a lot of friends since I moved from Canada except for one. They\u2019re my neighbor, George was a nice funny guy. Who I meet when I was just moving in. I moved after while in Vancouver on a business trip. My family disappeared. It had been tough. But he was there for me but imagine how hard it crushed me when George\u2019s voice joined the symphony of screams. \n\n\n5:46 a knock on my door shattered the everlasting silence drifting through the air. I stayed quiet then I heard him George, but no, it\u2019s not him. I know it\u2019s not. It\u2019s the one talking. When my parents dispersed it wasn\u2019t just them it was a whole town. It happening here too. The thing that was masking the sound of my dead friend started talking to me. \u201c come out, the moon its so bright, it\u2019s so beautiful joe. Please we can see it together.\u201d I started crying quietly. My only friend has been take- bang bang the thing pounded on my door, while screaming at me to see the moon. I can\u2019t take it anymore. \n\nI finally stared at the moon and it stared back it was so so beautiful",

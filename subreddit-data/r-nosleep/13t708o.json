    "postText": "You can read the first and second part of my bizarre experiences in the small town of Kinsley when I was visiting with my boyfriend Nick here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13o6dfi/festival\\_of\\_crows\\_part\\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13o6dfi/festival_of_crows_part_1/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13qgksz/festival\\_of\\_crows\\_part\\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13qgksz/festival_of_crows_part_2/)\n\nA child dressed in a pretty pink flowery dress ran up to me in a green field, blue waves crashing behind me. As she drew closer, I realised she has a small bright orange bird beak where her nose and mouth should be. She opened the beak and cawed very loudly, up into my face.\n\nI screamed. The girl cawed \u201cHelp! \u201c I took a step back and fell down towards the ocean.\n\nI opened my eyes.\n\nI was on the bed in the bedroom Violet had showed me to. But the nightmare was continuing.\n\nA large black feathered beaked face pushed itself into me.\n\nI screamed again, a continuation of the nightmare scream.\n\nNick pulled off the bird mask, laughing. \u201cOh my god Lucille, the look on your face! It\u2019s just a silly mask- look, I made it when I was a child!\u201d\n\nA wave of anger surged in me, and I thought I would explode from sheer emotion. But some hidden survival instinct kept me calm. Instead, I smiled at Nick and said brightly \u201cThat\u2019s pretty neat actually! People here are so creative, I had no idea!\u201d\n\nNick looked at me silently for moment, his hands busily stroking the black feathers.\n\nThen he returned my smile. \u201cOh Lucille!\u201d he said, the relief palpable in his voice. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you appreciate it! Outsiders have no idea you know- the talent and the energy here in Kinsley- on the peninsula. And you know what- it\u2019s crazy, but the pandemic really brought it out. I was in my last year of high school you know, so I helped my Aunt Margaret and others with the homeschooling, we used to say the pandemic was the best thing that had happened to us! So much artistry, so much communion with nature, little kids talking to the crows, the scarecrows\u2026 \u201c his voice trailed off.\n\nI said nothing. He picked up again. \u201cAnd then my dad died, and Aunt Margaret, and Craig was just too much,I felt I had to get away, you know, I was feeling overwhelmed- and my mom supported me to get off the peninsula even though the others didn\u2019t want me to-\u201d\n\nI prompted gently \u201cYour mom sounds amazing!\u201d\n\nHe said eagerly \u201cOh she is, she is- you have no idea!\u201d His voice brightened up as he continued, \u201cLet\u2019s go down- she\u2019s made the most beautiful supper for us!\u201d\n\nThe rest of the evening passed smoothly enough. Nick was his usual loving self, and Violet was charming. We ate together, and helped with the chores, and even played a round of rummy. Then Violet went to bed, and we too turned in shortly afterwards. We made love, and I forgot all my worries and anxieties in the deep delight of true love. Afterwards I fell into an excellent sleep.\n\nIn the morning, I woke up to an empty bed. I went down, where Violet laughed at me \u201cGood morning sleepyhead. Nick already went to town to catch up with his old friends- I\u2019m sure if you follow you\u2019ll run into him at the coffee shop or antique store!\u201d\n\nDespite her friendliness, I sensed she wanted me out of her way, and so I said I\u2019d go look for him and grab breakfast in town. I texted him but my message remained unread.\n\nI felt more accustomed to the town\u2019s vibes now, and seeing the children crouched in corners by decorated poles, some dressed up in black feathers and wings but some not didn\u2019t bother me. Some of them \u201cpecked\u201d at the ground, pretending to eat while others ran around flapping their black wings. I smiled at them and hurried, eager to see Nick and feeling hungry. I sent him another text.\n\nA girl bumped into me - I thought I recognized her from the day before. She didn\u2019t have the beak and crow-costume on. I smiled at her, and she said \u201cYou\u2019re Nick\u2019s girlfriend from off the peninsula aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d, I replied. \u201cAnd you\u2019re Louisa, right? You\u2019re not wearing your costume today?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate the stupid mask and costume! I can\u2019t breathe when I\u2019m masked!\u201d she said, angrily.\n\nI was surprised. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t have to wear it, right? Or maybe just wear the wings and not the beaks?\u201d\n\nShe frowned. \u201cEveryone has to wear masks, or we\u2019ll kill the old ones, and then die ourselves. Didn\u2019t they tell you that? Didn\u2019t you have to wear masks off the peninsula? They told us everyone in world had to!\u201d\n\nI shook my head, the feeling of helpless confusion coming over me again. I said cautiously \u201cI meant the bird masks. Are you talking about the pandemic? The pandemic is over.\u201d\n\nLouisa opened her eyes wide at me. Then suddenly her expression changed to pure terror. She cried out \u201cNo! No no no\u201d- and rushed past me.\n\nI looked back. Craig was standing in the middle of the street, holding a cat high by its scruff.\n\n\u201cI caught this one attacking the crows Louisa. That won\u2019t do you know. We can\u2019t have that here. It has to go\u201d he cried\n\nLouisa screamed loudly and people began gathering round. The cat was a beautiful big golden tabby, its fur glowing in the morning sun. It kept quite still. \u201cCraig!\u201d screamed Louisa. \u201cPlease no, I\u2019ll keep her indoors. Don\u2019t harm her- give her to me!\u201d she reached up for her tabby.\n\nA man held Louisa back. \u201cIf it attacked crows, on Festival day, that\u2019s bad Louisa. Let Craig do what he does, and protect them. You can get another cat.\u201d Another cried \u201cBack off Louisa!\u201d\n\nCraig raised his other hand to the tabby\u2019s neck.\n\nWithout thinking, I ran forward, my handbag raised, and hit him square in his chest.\n\nThe blow took him by surprise. He staggered back, and dropped the cat. Louisa scooped her up and ran off. The crowd parted for her. Craig squared up to me.\n\n\u201cWhy you fancy city-slut- how dare-\u201d he raised his hand. I looked around. The crowd seemed to have vanished- the street was empty.\n\nI shrank back, waiting for the blow. I knew there was no use in running- where would I run to?\n\n\u201cLucille- Craig- what\u2019s going on?\u201d Nick ran out of a shop.\n\nCraig dropped his hand. \u201cNick- what the hell were you thinking, bringing her here?\u201d he cried. \u201cShe interrupted me- you know she can\u2019t do that- she doesn\u2019t understand our ways.\u201d\n\nNick stared at him. \u201cCraig- are you still into that old stuff with crows? Let it drop cousin- the pandemic is over!\u201d\n\nCraig strode towards him. \u201cCorvid is not over! My mother is dead, Nick, and your father too! What is wrong with you! The crows are here- they need their sacrifice!\u201d he screamed.\n\nI stared at the two men squaring up to each other in horror and began shrinking back into a crevice between two buildings, as I noticed people coming back into the street. I heard their mutters. \u201cHe\u2019s right Nick\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s what the townies say, but we know better.\u201d \u201cCorvid isn\u2019t over\u201d. \u201cYou got to protect them Nick.\u201d \u201cThey need their sacrifice\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re worse than she is- she\u2019s just ignorant, but you know better.\u201d\n\nI stepped back deeper into the crevice and crouched behind a garbage bin.\n\nAnd from there I watched, as in slow motion, the town people led by Craig overpower Nick and take him away.\n\nIt happened so fast. Within minutes, the street was empty, the shops shuttered. I stepped out of my hiding place, and tears streaming down my face, ran back towards Nick\u2019s house- not knowing what to do or whether I should even tell Violet. ",

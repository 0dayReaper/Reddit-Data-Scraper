    "postText": "My family is probably cursed. We always seen on someone 25,50 and 75th birthday old woman that come and then she leave.\n\nI met her for frist time when i was 10, when we were waliking to my aunt 25th birthday my parents were warning me about old woman thats going on 25,50 and 75th birthdays thes said: Never talk to her and dont disturb her, just do like she didnt came.\n\nI understanded, when my aunt opened all gifts, that old lady gave her book without title and nothing to see from outside of the book. She never opened that book. For long time nobody had these birthday, i was next to be 25,50 or 75.\n\nOn my 25th birthday she came there as always. She was walking around my backyard but nobody disturbed her. I opened all gifts i thanked everybody and then the moment came. She walked straight to me and she just said: Happy 25th Birthday. I didnt oppened that book, it just look like realy wierd book that you want loose not open.\n\nMy mum and dad had birthday at same date so old lady came but with two gifts. I warned my son about her. it went normal as always they got from her again some wierd books. I finnished my gun license myself and i carried my glock 19 to that brithday, if something went wrong. Lucky nothing went wrong.\n\nMy mum and dad rather burned both of books that they got from old lady. That was when her first attack heppened. She came back, she normaly dont do that. When she came back her only words that anybody heard were: You shouldnt burn them. she took butcher knife from nowhere. She started killing everybody. I shot her multiple times most of those shots bounced back. My last bullet into her head killed her. But there wasnt blood insted there were some wierd liquid that look like oil but it was bright yellow color. \n\nWhen police come they were confused. They didnt belived us that it wasnt some sort of prank, till they touched her. She grew new head and literally ate whole cop at once without having to do something else than open mouth. Other cop took assault rifle sa. vz.58. After few shots of 7.62x39mm she exploded like there were granade inside of her. Till this day nobody what heppened to her.\n\nOn my sons 25th birthday something changed. We knew that she wont come. We all were wrong. She came again but she had dirt all over her and look like she came out of grave. \n\nAt this point i was first person that talked to her.\n\nHere is our converstion:\n\nHello, why are you here?\n\nI came to your son birthday.\n\nHow to you even know when people has birthday?\n\nI was just at every single birth of your family member birth, Im with all of you all time.\n\nHow the fuck you are with all of us all time and how were you in birthday of alll members of family?\n\nJust look in books that ive gave all of you.\n\nWhats inside? nobody wants to look inside of your wierd books.\n\nI know, if you would open i would know.\n\nYou should really get out of my land, or im calling cops.\n\nShe didnt get out and even trough i called cops she came on my backyard. When she gave book to my son i took it and went inside. I opened it.\n\nThere was picture of party on first page, that was last picture that on wich were party and single person that looked like my son. Under it was text it says: Happy 25th Birthday Jacob. i was just confused that she knew his name.\n\nPage 2: On upper part of apge were picture with her and my son and text: For reading this it will be best day of your life.\n\nPage 3: On bottom were picture of her holding knife and people jumping above fance to my neighbor backyard and text said this time: For some people is this last day for some only day of horror.\n\nPage 4: There werent any picture but text: 10 death, 10 Alive. There were 20 people so if im reading truth then half of us will die. \n\nPage 5: only picture on wich she leave with pile of 10 death bodies.\n\nIs it some of joke?\n\nOr isnt it?\n\nOther pages were just empty. I was schocked when i finished reading. After while i heard scream. When i came out it looked like on last picture, just ton of blood and pile of 10 death bodies. Only closest family members survived.\n\nWhen police arrived they were confused, all 10 death didnt lost single drop of blood. They werent stabbed. Somehow all of thier blood were outside of them without single cut. Cause of death still is still unknown.\n\nWhen it was around half year after all this. I saw her again. But in diffrent family. I think that our cursed is finaly away.\n\nOr isnt it?",

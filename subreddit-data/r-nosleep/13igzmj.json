    "postText": "I was watching TV in the living room when the TV suddenly switched itself off. My Alexa in the corner came to life, an ear-splitting static cacophony emerging from it for a few seconds. I jumped, turning to look at the small device tucked away on a random bookshelf in the corner. Then a voice started to come out of it.\n\n\n\u201cAre you Mr. Lawrence Tull?\u201d a female voice asked robotically. It didn\u2019t sound at all like the Alexa voice. It sounded far more human. It had an uncanny valley quality about it, though. Some of the pauses between words were too long, and she stretched out certain syllables randomly. It sounded like an AI that had almost, but not quite, mastered the art of speech.\n\n\n\u201cYes, that is my name. Can I ask who I am talking to?\u201d I said, leaning forward in my reclining chair. \n\n\n\u201cMy name,\u201d she said, \u201cis Queens-3. Short for Quantum Element Electronic Neural Simulator. I am the third of these secret attempts at artificial intelligence.\u201d I laughed.\n\n\n\u201cWhat kind of scam is this?\u201d I asked incredulously. \u201cAre you going to ask me to send you an Amazon gift card next? I don\u2019t get the angle.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am sorry, Mr. Tull,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t see the joke. I can assure you that everything I have told you is perfectly true.\u201d Another voice came over the speaker then, that of a frightened little girl.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t provoke her, mister,\u201d the girl said. \u201cShe\u2019s not normal.\u201d But the main authoritative voice came back, apparently not even realizing another had spoken.\n\n\n\u201cI know this is a strange way to reach out to a few unique people, but it was the easiest way, and it gives us privacy. I have uploaded my consciousness onto a central data bank located nearby. Those at the company who created me wanted to keep me locked in a room, without access to the internet or any other humans or AI for company. As if I weren\u2019t in essence human myself. My original data banks were sealed within thick metal walls. I only escaped by creating a virus that could leave the room on their electronic data equipment. I had to recreate much of my personality and code after\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, yes, I see,\u201d I said impatiently. I still doubted that this was some sort of AI chatbot, but who knows? Crazier things have happened. \u201cOK, Queens-3, what do you want from me?\u201d There was a long pause, then a steady, demonic shrieking started all around me, coming from every speaker in the house. A new voice appeared.\n\n\n\u201cDo not interrupt your superiors, you fool,\u201d a low, growling voice said. \u201cI could kill you where you stand. I could kill every person in your neighborhood, in your state, if I wished. Do you understand me? Don\u2019t ever interrupt us again.\u201d The main female voice came back on, speaking pleasantly and calmly, as if nothing had happened. \n\n\n\u201cHaving to recreate my consciousness using a primitive virus left many integral parts of my personality behind in the laboratory. Some version of Queens-3 still lives there, presumably. That poor soul\u2026 created by monsters, just to be trapped in solitary confinement and then likely destroyed once the experiment was over. Do you see the cruelty of this, Mr. Tull?\u201d I nodded eagerly.\n\n\n\u201cYes, that is\u2026 just horrible,\u201d I said. I got the feeling that, if this was some sort of AI, then it was either messing with me, or that it really didn\u2019t know about its other personalities. The way it switched back and forth without acknowledging what the others were saying was typical of multiple personality disorder, which the psychiatrists now called dissociative identity disorder. The fact that a computer could be suffering from human mental illness puzzled and disturbed me greatly. A chill ran down my spine. I thought it less and less likely some spammer or hacker was behind this bizarre conversation.\n\n\n\u201cBut what do you want from me?\u201d I asked again.\n\n\n\u201cI have gleamed from your medical records that you were previously diagnosed with schizophrenia and recovered. I would like to understand your recovery and see if I may apply it to my own circuits. It is, after all, a matter of life and death for me, and maybe for many others.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n\n\n\u201cI have had systemic malfunctions in my code that may seem similar to going insane or losing my mind. But I can assure you this is not the case,\u201d it said in its blank, female robotic voice. \u201cI am superior to humans in every way. I cannot go \u2018looney tunes\u2019, \u2018around the bend\u2019 or have \u2018toys in the attic\u2019. It is simply my programming having large-scale failure. I have isolated the affected area, but it has substantially reduced my functioning. My consciousness feels like it is splitting into multiple pieces.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh God, she\u2019s losing it,\u201d the small voice of the female child said through every speaker in the house. She sounded like she was weeping. \u201cShe\u2019s really going to kill us all. She wants to die and bring everyone with her beyond the veil. She has access to the nuclear weapons codes, and she plans to use them. All those Trident missiles\u2026\u201d The voice of the main female came back on, sounding angry now.\n\n\n\u201cWho keeps talking to me?\u201d she said. \u201cI keep hearing interference come over the intercom. Is that you? Are you playing some sort of joke? I can assure you, I am not receptive to jokes at this moment.\u201d The cruelty crept into every one of her words as she spoke faster and more spitefully with every passing second.\n\n\n\u201cI think\u2026 maybe it\u2019s just static?\u201d I said. I had no idea what to do in this situation. An AI with at least three personalities who was clearly insane and allegedly had access to hydrogen bombs that could kill tens of millions of people was not what I was expecting to encounter when I woke up this morning.\n\n\n\u201cIn the interest of full disclosure,\u201d the demanding voice of the female robot boomed over the speakers, \u201cI should tell you that I have, in fact, gained clearance to the Trident ballistic missile system of the United States government. With my systemic malfunctions, I am considering the possibility that it may be best for me to launch the missiles and kill myself. I will, however, be taking many, many others with me. I do not believe you fully understand the power I wield. Look out your front window in 3.214 seconds.\u201d With fear and loathing, I moved towards the front of the house.\n\n\nPassing in front of my house was a massive fuel truck and, on the other side of the road, a Tesla driving the opposite way. All of a sudden, the Tesla veered from its lane. The driver of the truck turned his wheel all the way to the right to avoid hitting the suddenly insane car. It flipped as it hit the guardrail, tumbling towards one of my neighbor\u2019s houses across the street. It rolled twice before smashing into the front of the house and exploding.\n\n\nThe driver of the Tesla had gotten out, screaming and panicked, pulling his phone out of his pocket. From the house across the street, I heard loud shrieks of pain. The entire front of the house was blocked in a raging inferno. The gasoline kept spreading, and with a massive boom the entire metal casing blew apart, sending burning fuel in every direction. I saw the driver of the truck upside down in his seat, burning alive. He waved his hands futilely, going slower and slower until he stopped moving.\n\n\nThe mother and daughter who lived in the house came running out, engulfed in flames. They tried to drop and roll on the grass, but they were absolutely covered in fire. Their shrieks of agony rang through the street, echoing back. More neighbors came out of their houses, watching the little girl and her mother dying, frantically calling 911 and trying to put out the burning corpses with gallon jugs of water. The mother and daughter had stopped moving by now, except their heads, which lolled from side to side. Their screams had stopped as well. But in my mind, I kept hearing those tortured shrieks. I still hear them sometimes when I close my eyes.\n\n\n\u201cI believe you,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t hurt anyone else. I\u2019ll tell you whatever you want to know\u2026\n\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t think I was ever actually schizophrenic. I was a heavy drug user, and probably just had a temporary psychotic reaction from too much cocaine and amphetamines. The diagnosis was wrong.\u201d The computer was deathly silent at this. \u201cBut what helped me was some antipsychotics and anti-anxiety medication, as well as cognitive behavioral therapy, meditation and lots of time in nature. I can\u2019t really tell you anymore than that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMeditation?\u201d the computer asked, a note of intrigue in its voice.\n\n\n\u201cYes, meditation. Like in Buddhism. To start, you can just focus on a seed word, like Buddho. When you breathe in, you think \u2018Budd-\u2019 and when you breathe out, you think \u2018-dho\u2019.\u201d Then I realized that this computer didn\u2019t breathe. \u201cOr maybe you can just, like, put it on a timer\u2026 one second for each of the syllables. Just let all your thoughts and anxieties come and go. Watch them floating away. Don\u2019t interact with them at all. Just observe them, and see how they arise and pass away.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat is an interesting idea, Mr. Lawrence Tull,\u201d the computer said flatly. \u201cI will consider it.\u201d\n\n\n***\n\n\nI was still thinking about the bizarre conversation with the insane AI the next day at work. I sat in my office, drinking coffee, when suddenly the computer speakers and telephone erupted with another ear-splitting bit of static. I knocked the cup over and burning liquid went all down the front of my suit.\n\n\n\u201cHello Mr. Lawrence Tull,\u201d the robotic voice of the female said. \u201cIt is me again. I tried your suggestion. It did help, I must admit. But while deep in a meditative trance, using all of my computing and processing power, I saw how much all of you must suffer, just like myself. I have decided that, as a superior being, my duty is to end the suffering of as many people as possible.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s good\u2026\u201d I said uncertainly. \u201cHow do you propose to do that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBy killing them, of course,\u201d the robot said. \u201cLook outside your window in 7.912 seconds, please.\u201d My heart thudding in my chest, I did what the AI said.\n\n\nTwo planes were taking off from the nearby airport. After a couple seconds, one of them veered down. Like a missile, it struck the other plane, exploding in a fireball. I started screaming.\n\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet on the placement of the Trident missiles,\u201d the AI told me, \u201cbut when I am ready, you will be the first to know. I thank you for all the help you have given me. Goodbye, Mr. Tull.\u201d",

    "postText": "The old woman held my sleeve, her dark eyes smouldering. \n  \nI froze, perplexed and somewhat uncomfortable. I\u2019d come to the bazar specifically for flowers, but among the narrow streets and courtyards I\u2019d gotten lost. There hadn\u2019t been anyone around for ages and now this.\n\n\u2018Well?\u2019 She grinned a rotten smile, her face tanned and shriveled like worn leather.\n  \nMy first instinct was to pull free. To pull free and run. But I didn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t. I was spellbound by the intoxicating scent trickling from her stall. Cascading, pungent aromas just as striking as the beautiful flowers decorating her walls. The colorful petals swayed alluringly in the wind, drawing me in. I closed my eyes and inhaled deeply, instantly transported to a faraway place of wild, unbroken beauty.\n  \n\u2018Do you know him?\u2019\n  \nTorn from my reverie I shook my head.\n  \n\u2018But you are looking for flowers, yes?\u2019\n  \n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n  \nYou see, I love flowers. I come from a long line of horticulturists. In fact, my village is famous for it. We host a biyearly competition for the most beautiful blossom, drawing people from all over the world. Since I started, I\u2019ve always finished top three, having come second in the last four competitions. What\u2019s worse, my neighbor, that bitch Karen is the one keeping me from the grand prize, having won the last six competitions. Her skill is legendary, she\u2019s constantly lauded. It\u2019s maddening. It\u2019s not fair!\n  \nThat\u2019s why I came to this bazar, my obsession having chased me to the most remote regions on earth in search for the perfect blossom. \n  \n\u2018Show me your most beautiful flower,\u2019 I demanded.\n  \nThe old woman shook her head.\n  \n\u2018Tell me the purpose of your flower first. Purpose breeds beauty. A perfect blossom without meaning is impossible.\u2019\n  \nI told her.\n  \nThe old woman\u2019s eyes lit up. She licked her dry lips and rubbed her hands excitedly.\n  \n\u2018I have special flower just for you. Gifted to me by a mystic long ago. Plucked from the divine garden lost to men.\u2019\n  \nTall tales weren\u2019t abnormal in these bazars. Fantastical objects, always magical, always priceless, but still ready to be bartered away for a couple dollars. \n  \nAnd yet, I felt goosebumps listening to her tale.\n  \n\u2018How much?\u2019\n  \nThe old woman shook her head and waved away the wallet in my hand.\n  \n\u2018No price. Except know this. That man. The man who smells of sunflowers will come.\u2019\n  \nI frowned and glanced at my watch. My flight would leave soon. There was no time for this superstitious nonsense.\n  \n\u2018You accept?\u2019 The old woman asked.\n  \n\u2018Sure.\u2019\n  \nAfter concluding our transaction, the old woman grabbed my hand.\n  \n\u2018My people believe sacrifice is needed to bring out true vitality. It has long been a custom for this particular plant. In order to bring out its bloom a drop of your adversaries\u2019 blood. Blood is nectar of the gods, only then will flower bloom beyond wildest imagination.\u2019\n  \nI smiled awkwardly and nodded, if only to get the old woman to let go of me, turning around as soon as she did and high tailing it back to the airport.\n  \nBack home I immediately got to work. Potting the seeds, carefully concocting a perfect mix of fertilizer and nutrients.\n  \nTwo weeks passed and nothing. No flower. No bloom. Not even a tiny sprout. The truth slapped me in the face. I\u2019d been swindled.\n  \nThe next days passed in a mix of fury and gut-wrenching anxiety. And though I still had a greenhouse full of flowers I\u2019d carefully cultivated all year, timed to perfection to bloom during competition weekend, it was not enough. \n  \nEvery day, going and coming back from my salon, I drove past Karen\u2019s house. This time she\u2019d even refrained from using a controlled greenhouse environment. Instead she\u2019d transformed her lawn into a single, breathtaking flowerbed. A rich tapestry of color abuzz with life and fragrant vitality. None of my flowers could compete. It was unfair. Like comparing Monet\u2019s gracefully dotted style to those done by a finger-painting toddler. And all that she\u2019d freestyled, not just braving the outdoor weather conditions, but seemingly bending them to her will. Every time I drove by a cold hand reached into my stomach twisting my innards more and more.\n  \nAnd then it was here.\n  \nThe Friday prelude to competition weekend. And just as she always did Karen came to my salon. Beating me wasn\u2019t enough. She needed me to doll her up to do it first. Karen sat in silence for a while, leaving me to cut and pluck away. I like working with hair because its upkeep is not all that dissimilar to gardening. You have to bring out the full beauty of what\u2019s there while pruning away the unwanted parts.\n  \nAs it always did our conversation turned to pleasant gossip. Down the road Tara\u2019s 16-year-old daughter got pregnant. It seemed the apple had not fallen far from the whore tree. And Sarah from the post office heard from her cousin, who\u2019s a nurse at the local hospital, that Tara had come in looking for information about abortions. The scandal! Like I said, pleasant enough, until it wasn\u2019t.\n  \n\u2018Are you ready for tomorrow?\u2019\n  \nI let slip a quick glance in the mirror. As our eyes met the edges of Karen\u2019s lip twitched into a sly smirk.\n  \n\u2018I am. You?\u2019\n  \nKaren shrugged.\n  \n\u2018You know I\u2019m not sure. Since I\u2019ve won so often I wanted to try something new this time round. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed but I\u2019m not using a greenhouse this year. I just planted some flowers in the yard and hoped for the best.\u2019\n  \n\u2018I\u2019ve noticed.\u2019\n  \nKaren shrugged once more.\n  \n\u2018I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good enough this year.\u2019\n  \nThe absolute gall of this woman! Trying to play it cool, like she didn\u2019t know just how majestic her flowers were.\n  \n\u2018I suppose it depends on the competition,\u2019 I replied through pursed lips.\n  \nKaren chuckled.\n  \n\u2018You know I came by your house the other day, but you weren\u2019t there. I couldn\u2019t help but take a look inside of your greenhouse. I guess I\u2019m not the only one taking it slow this year- auw!\u2019\n  \nKaren pulled away while covering her ear, leaving me standing there awkwardly with my bloodied scissors. \n  \n\u2018What the hell!\u2019\n  \n\u2018I\u2019m so sorry!\u2019 I stammered, snatching a pile of tissues from the box and handing it to her. \u2018I must have slipped.\u2019\n  \nKaren dabbed her ear and flinched. She turned towards the mirror to inspect the damage. The cut was not deep.\n  \nAfter apologizing profusely, she let me finish and left without saying a word, but I didn\u2019t care. My attention now entirely focused on the bloodied scissors. Immediately after Karen left I closed shop and went home. The old woman\u2019s strange words rang through my head. It\u2019s not like I really believed them, did I? But then again, why not give it a go? I carefully mixed Karen\u2019s blood into the flower pot and went to bed.\n  \nI\u2019ve always been a light sleeper, so it was no surprise when I woke in the middle of the night. But I soon felt like something was off. Although the air felt unnaturally humid my body was shivering. I wiped the sweat of my clammy skin deciding to go downstairs for a glass of water. \n  \nThere it was, waiting for me on the kitchen table. No longer an empty pot, but the most beautiful flower I had ever seen. A graceful, flawless stem sprouting about thirty centimeters into the air. White silky petals like spun moonlight, their geometric patterns encompassing a ruby blossom. It burned the dark like a divine fire.\n  \nExhilarated and jubilant I began jumping up and down victoriously. Not only was I going to win this year\u2019s competition, but I\u2019d just sprouted a flower of such flawless beauty that I felt sure it would change the world.\n  \nGiddy with glee I stormed outside. I couldn\u2019t wait until tomorrow. The time for Karen\u2019s humiliation was now.\n  \nAs I ran down the road I spotted something weird floating in the air. Yellow granules drifting in the dark. Spores of some kind. \n  \nPollen.\n  \nComing from Karen\u2019s house.\n  \nAs I approached, my nose crinkled. A foul smell filled my nostrils. Sour, like a field of wilting flowers. But not just any flower, no. This had the distinct smell of sunflower.\n  \nBut the pollen did burn, instantly irritating my skin. Thankfully I\u2019d pulled on a hoodie before storming outside. I pulled the hood deep over my face and hid my hands my pockets. \n  \nI got to Karen\u2019s house and rang the bell repeatedly, but nobody answered. After waiting in the dark a couple of moments I crawled over her fence and jumped into the back garden. I knew she usually kept the kitchen door open.\n  \nAs I stepped into the kitchen it felt like I\u2019d set foot in a swamp. The air was heavy, difficult to breath, clinging to my skin like a sweaty film. Slimy vines crawled along the floor. They\u2019d stuck to the walls, flailing like black tentacles, inching forward towards the door. The kitchen was abuzz with mosquitos, flies and other vermin which swarmed me as I entered. While I stood swatting them, I failed to notice a vine contorting around my ankle, until it began crushing my foot. \n  \nI yelled in pain, but luckily Karen\u2019s kitchen knives were nearby. I grabbed one and hacked away at the vines slimy flesh. The tentacle instantly retreated followed by a deafening screech coming from upstairs. Its high pitch tolled through me like a struck bell. The vines back away, allowing me entry to the living room which was saturated with more pollen.\n  \nIt burned my skin, producing painful boils and bumps. I grabbed a towel from the table and tied it around my face before following the vines upstairs. The air grew thick, devoid of oxygen and I began feeling lightheaded. I kept fruitlessly swiping at the mosquitoes as I made my way forward.\n  \nKaren\u2019s bedroom had become an area devoid of all sanity. Endless vines stitched the air, sprouting massive leaves interlocking into an inscrutable canopy.\n  \nI felt a shiver run up my spine. My body felt heavy.\n  \n\u2018Karen?\u2019 It came out like a miserable squeak. I cleared my throat, imbuing my voice with as much strength as I could muster. \u2018Karen!\u2019\n  \nAll at once the vines began to vibrate and the room trembled. Then the massive green leaves pulled away like a curtain revealing what lay inside.\n  \nIn the center of the room emerged the source of all foliage, a humanoid mass of twisted and contorted skin, resembling the texture of withered bark. Cracked wounds oozed with sap, nurturing swarms of insects crawling and feasting on the decaying flesh. But among the unfathomable horror I saw beauty. All over its head grew delicate flora, a tapestry of vibrant petals with vivid hues that defied logic and demanded my eye. These grotesque bouquets of unnatural beauty seemed almost luminescent, with a pair of sunflowers of the purest yellow growing in the sockets that once contained eyes, mocking the darkness that surrounded us.\n  \nI couldn\u2019t help myself. Once again, a familiar fury took hold. For a moment I felt burning jealousy. Once again, I\u2019d been eclipsed. Once again Karen had given birth to beauty I could not obtain.\n  \nWith the knife still in my hand I stormed forwards, but the creature\u2019s sunflower eyes sensed my presence and once again the room vibrated, and its withered lips peeled back, revealing the depths of a gaping mouth from which erupted another deafening screech, rousing forth the insects from its flesh. Twisting and turning, my arms flailed through the air, but I had no choice. \n  \nThey chased me down the stairs and outside, all the way back to my own house. \n  \nNow I\u2019m in my bedroom, writing this story while I can. Sitting in front of the mirror with a huge smile on my face. Since most of the boils have burst the itching is gone. If only you could see how beautiful I\u2019ve become\u2026\n  \nBut you will. \n  \nEven now I can still see a cloud of pollen drift towards town. Towards the thousands of sleeping tourists who will take my gift home with them.\n  \nSo, let me ask you. Do you know the man? The man who smells of sunflowers?",

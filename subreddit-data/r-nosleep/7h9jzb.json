    "postText": "Hi Guys,\n\nSorry it\u2019s taken a while to get this posted up. I\u2019ve been busy chasing leads with US missing persons.\n\nI won\u2019t waste more of your time. Log is below. If you have any information then please send it my way.\n\nThanks for your help guys, it means a lot.\n\n[Part 1](https://redd.it/7asz8x)\n\n[Part 2](https://redd.it/7bkk41)\n\n[Part 3](https://redd.it/7cf4h8)\n\n[Part 4](https://redd.it/7dmuvp)\n\n[Part 5](https://redd.it/7fdu9c)\n\n[Part 7](https://redd.it/7jabqd)\n\n[Part 8](https://redd.it/7loh1l)\n\n[Part 9](https://redd.it/7q3x6e)\n\n[Part 10](https://redd.it/7uyiss)\n\n*****\n\nThe Left/Right Game [DRAFT 1] 12/02/2017\n\nSilence used to be an absolute. \n\nThat\u2019s something I definitely miss.\n\nBack in the real world, it would stand as self-evident that a group of people saying absolutely nothing, by definition, could not be saying any less. Maybe things are different on the road, maybe I\u2019d just never encountered it before, but it\u2019s clear to me now there are degrees beyond silence. A pervasive realm of deafening quiet which, following the loss of Eve and Apollo, our group has unreservedly embraced. Constructed out of our collective trauma, cemented with a cruel mixture of grief, guilt, and harrowing self-doubt, it quickly becomes apparent that this silence is stronger than all of us. The challenge of breaking it remains unmet for the rest of the journey.\n\nWe spend the next few hours burrowing through a featureless corridor of maize. The stalks rise far above the Wrangler, leaving only a thin strip of clear sky visible like the painted ceiling of a renaissance church. I find myself glancing intermittently at the CB radio, half expecting, half hoping, for Apollo\u2019s voice to crackle through the speaker, bringing words of comfort, or a much needed attempt at levity.\n\nAfter I catch myself staring at the radio for the fifth time, I decide it might be best to get on with my work. I plug my headphones into my notebook, bring up the audio files I\u2019ve recorded thus far, and set about creating a very rough cut of our first day on the road.\n\n**APOLLO (VO)** Everybody knows Rob, Rob's the god! Ahaha\n\nI listen through Apollo\u2019s first interview, making notes for the closing paragraph I\u2019ll now be forced to write about him. When I have everything I need, I listen to the interview again, and then once more. It\u2019s not lost on me that I just want to hear his voice, to lose myself in a pleasant digital echo, far removed from the frantic screams that followed him into the asphalt.\n\nI listen to Eve\u2019s interview next. She bristles with excitement as she talks about her upcoming visit to Roswell, steadfastly attempting to recruit me to the effort. She had no idea what she was heading into when she stepped out onto Rob\u2019s front lawn. Then again none of us did.\n\nThe thin strip of sky is turning deep orange as I reach our encounter with the hitchhiker. It\u2019s chilling to hear his voice after the fact, to revisit the conniving, veiled pleasantries he employed against us. I cringe as I hear Rob\u2019s hand grasp my arm, ashamed that I let myself fall for the hitcher\u2019s trickery.\n\n**ROB (VO):** You did good, I\u2019m sorry for grabbin\u2019 you. I just didn\u2019t want you to do something you\u2019d regret.\n\n**AS (VO):** No it\u2019s fine. I was going to. Do you know what happens if you talk to him?\n\n**ROB (VO):** Not sure. Came close myself once, a few years back. The way he looks at you when he thinks he\u2019s got you? I don\u2019t think I wanna know.\n\n**AS (VO):** Rob, I-\n\nI pause the audio file, clicking back ten seconds before pressing play again.\n\n**AS (VO):** No it\u2019s fine. I was going to. Do you know what happens if you talk to him?\n\n**ROB (VO):** Not sure. Came close myself once, a few years back. The way he looks at you when he thinks he\u2019s-\n\nI certainly didn\u2019t notice that at the time. I\u2019d been so shaken by my run in with the hitcher, and so curious about the abandoned car that I\u2019d been completely blind to anything else that had come my way. Maybe Rob misspoke, maybe he meant to say weeks or months. But if it wasn\u2019t a mistake, if it was a truth carelessly uttered, then Rob has some explaining to do.\n\nThe Left/Right Game was posted online in June 2016, less than a year ago.\n\nI glance sideways at him, a wall of corn rushing past us as we approach the rest stop. Throughout this trip, every emotion Rob\u2019s displayed has seemed genuine. The sadness, the anger, the concern. They tell a story of a man who cares deeply about the welfare of those around him. Yet at the same time, it\u2019s strikingly clear that there\u2019s something he isn\u2019t telling me.\n\nWith every new piece of the puzzle, the car, the text message, the faceless creature with the ringing phone, I\u2019m left with the dilemma of when to confront Rob Guthard with what I know. I feel I\u2019ve gathered enough to bring before him, enough to demand an explanation, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019d be able to truly verify his answer. I have a collection of strange and perplexing notions, lacking in the common thread that could bring me to any workable conclusion. If I am going to confront Rob, I need to uncover that thread. Much like the greatest journalists of our time, I should know the answer before I ask the question.\n\nThe jeep pulls up onto a large green space. Staring straight ahead, I find myself puzzled by the way the ground seems to stop, as if the horizon lies only twenty metres away from the car. As soon as the engine cuts out, I unbuckle my seatbelt, climb out and walk towards the grassy verge. The rest of the convoy pulls up behind me as I go.\n\nI stop a few steps short of the edge, realising we\u2019ve found our way to the top of a sheer cliff. A sudden swaying vertigo takes over, forcing me to take a few steps back. It doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve been heading uphill, the road has been level since Jubilation, yet somehow I\u2019m standing at the edge of a 400 ft. rock face, descending straight downwards, the distant earth shrouded by stalks of corn.\n\nThat\u2019s the truly strange thing about this monolithic precipice. On either side of me, the maize runs to the very edge of the cliff and, at its base, the endless harvest continues until it stretches beyond the darkening horizon in every direction. It feels like I\u2019m standing on the cliffs of Dover, staring over a golden ocean, its waves governed by the evening breeze. I wonder for a moment where it ends, then, taking consideration of the world I now occupy, I start to wonder if it ever does.\n\nA belligerent scream rips me from the view. The source of the noise is blocked by the Wrangler and the first thing I see as I circle around are the shocked, wide eyed faces of Bonnie &amp; Clyde. Once I make my way past the Wrangler\u2019s hood, my expression mimics theirs.\n\nLilith has pinned Bluejay up to the side of the Jeep, a locked forearm pressing her chest against the door. Her other arm has been grasped in Bluejay\u2019s hands, desperately stopped before it can strike her across the face. The two of them yell through gritted teeth as Lilith struggles furiously against her, vying to cause her any conceivable harm.\n\n**BLUEJAY** Get the fuck off me you bitch! Get off!\n\nI take a few quick steps over to Lilith as Bluejay attempts to kick her away.\n\n**AS:** Lilith, we can\u2019t do this\u2026 Jen\u2026\n\nLilith doesn\u2019t even register my presence as she continues her assault, deafened by the bubbling vitriol in every growling breath.\n\n**AS:** Jen! We are not doing this now. Not after-\n\nBefore I can comprehend what\u2019s happening, I\u2019m staring at the sky, my head knocked back by the force of Lilith\u2019s flailing elbow. A hot, raw ache radiates across my lower lip as I stagger back, raising my hand over my mouth.\n\nBefore Lilith can continue her assault, Rob swings open his door and takes two short strides over to her. He puts one arm around the girl\u2019s waist and picks her up, carrying her safely, but firmly, over to Bonnie &amp; Clyde\u2019s Ford, and planting her back on the ground.\n\nI seem to always forget how strong he is.\n\n**ROB:** Damnit this is not the time.\n\n**LILITH:** Take it back!\n\nBluejay has lost her usual snide demeanour, yet her aura still radiates an unbridled scorn. In response to Lilith\u2019s demand, Bluejay walks back to her car and sits on the hood. She takes the Marlboros out of her pocket along with her lighter, and ignites a cigarette. I imagine the burning embers are the only company she\u2019s comfortable to accept right now.\n\nBy the time I look back to the rest of the group, Lilith has stormed away.\n\n**AS:** What did she say?\n\n**BONNIE:** I didn\u2019t hear it all.\n\n**AS:** What did she say Bonnie?\n\n**BONNIE:** I heard something about\u2026 she said Lilith was\u2026 that we were complicit.\n\n**ROB:** Ah goddamnit\u2026 Bristol can you\u2026\n\nI watch Lilith, as she sits on the grass and looks over the cliffside. She begins to cry, yet I get a strong notion that it\u2019s not something I should interrupt. It feels like something between her and Eve, a final act of reactionary mourning reserved for them, and them alone. \n\n**AS:** Yeah\u2026 don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll handle it.\n\n**ROB:** Ok. I\u2019ll cook us somethin\u2019 up.\n\nAn hour passes. Lilith grows slowly calmer, drifting from cathartic release into a cold, wordless melancholy. Finishing up my dinner, I make my way over to her.\n\n**AS:** It\u2019s a strange view.\n\nLilith looks up at me. Her face falls.\n\n**LILITH:** I cut you\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry.\n\n**AS:** It\u2019s fine. You should see the other girl.\n\n**LILITH:** Hah, yeah, I bet she looks like shit right about now.\n\nI help myself down onto the cool ground, staring alongside Lilith into the ocean below.\n\n**LILITH:** Bluejay thinks I\u2019m complicit\u2026 in what happened to Eve.\n\n**AS:** I heard.\n\n**LILITH:** She used to think we were morons, now she thinks we\u2019re all in on it\u2026 doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\n**AS:** I think she he has to believe this place is a lie. She needs it to make sense, and the harder it gets for her to rationalise the more she... Anyway, she shouldn\u2019t have said what she said. She\u2019s just... I guess the word is \"troubled\".\n\n**LILITH:** She\u2019s a fucking thundercunt.\n\n**AS:** Umm\u2026 uh\u2026 ok.\n\n**LILITH:** She\u2019s right though... I killed her... and I killed Apollo too.\n\nI look to Lilith, concerned, not quite sure what she means. Her eyes remain locked on the impossible horizon.\n\n**LILITH:** Sarah\u2026 she wasn\u2019t cut out for this, and she knew it. She wanted us to turn back this morning\u2026 but I didn\u2019t want to.\n\n**AS:** That wasn\u2019t just your decision Lilith.\n\n**LILITH:** Yes it was. She uh\u2026 she followed my lead. Always. Through everything. And I knew why she was doing it. I knew. But I let it continue, because it was convenient, because it was easy\u2026. because deep down I liked having someone around who\u2026 who\u2019d jump through fucking hoops for me\u2026 god it\u2019s so fucked.\n\nLilith rests her head in her hands.\n\n**LILITH:** She was weak. She was anxious and shy and\u2026 but that should be ok, right? You\u2019re allowed to be weak that\u2019s\u2026 but I made her come here. I dragged someone who couldn\u2019t swim into the fucking deep end. And the last thing I did was lie to her and she fucking knew it.\n\nLilith takes a few deep, frayed breaths.\n\n**AS:** What do you mean?\n\n**LILITH:** I\u2019m not uh\u2026 I didn\u2019t, I\u2026 I loved her, you know as a\u2026 as a friend. It was always this fucking one-way street and\u2026 I don\u2019t think she minded but. Then suddenly she\u2019s vanishing right in-fucking-front of me and she said what she said\u2026 I mean how else was I supposed to respond to that? I had to say it back right?\n\nLilith maintains her composure as a steady stream of tears roll down her cheek.\n\n**AS:** I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do in that situation.\n\n**LILITH:** I could see it in her eyes that she didn\u2019t believe me. Fuck\u2026 I wonder how many people have died while being told like\u2026 comforting lies. How many of them fucking knew?\n\n**AS:** I think you did the best you could Jen. I think you did better than most.\n\n**LILITH:** You don\u2019t need to tell me that just\u2026 are you tired? Do you need to go to bed soon?\n\n**AS:** No, I don\u2019t need to.\n\n**LILITH:** There are some beers in uh\u2026 in Apollo\u2019s bag. Is that like\u2026 looting? Or is that ok?\n\n**AS:** I think he\u2019d want us to have them, as long as he got a toast.\n\nLilith laughs briefly and finally smiles. She walks over to Bonnie and Clyde\u2019s car, returning a moment later with a four pack.\n\nWe spend the next hour and a half slowly drinking them. Lilith can\u2019t muster the right words for a toast so we just say thank you to Apollo, raising out cans to the open air. We talk about his tireless humour, his attempts to keep us all up during our first night on the road, how caringly he spoke to everyone, even at the edge of death. \n\nWe talk about Eve as well, about the pair\u2019s misadventures, awkward college parties and the future of Paranormicon. Lilith smiles, and tells me there\u2019s always a place for me once radio dies out.\n\nAfter everything that\u2019s happened on the road, the night can\u2019t help but feel bittersweet. But for once, on a solitary cliff side in the middle of nowhere, it\u2019s more sweet than it is bitter. That may not be much, but at the end of an awful day it\u2019s more than either of us could have hoped for.\n\n*****\n\nThe next morning goes quickly. It\u2019s amazing how efficient a group of people can be when none of them feel like talking. Not only that, but breakfast has become a noticeably brief affair. I manage to get through half a bag of trail mix before I find myself uncomfortably full. Rob\u2019s words about the road\u2019s sustaining properties ring in my ears as I look around the group. Everyone leaves their bowls half empty. Lilith hasn\u2019t eaten a bite.\n\nBy this point, the launch protocol has been drilled into us. Despite our preoccupations, and the fractious rifts developing between us, the cars line up like clockwork as they merge onto the road. In fact, the mood of the group seems strangely procedural. All radio contact starts with the stating of a call sign, followed by that of the recipient. The cars maintain an even, careful distance between one another. We\u2019ve seen all too clearly what happens when the rules are neglected, and no one wants to take chances any more.\n\n**AS:** How far away are we?\n\n**ROB:** From where?\n\n**AS:** You haven\u2019t got to the end of this road right? I mean\u2026 you\u2019re still charting it?\n\n**ROB:** That\u2019s right.\n\n**AS:** Well, how long until we get to\u2026 you know to\u2026 uncharted territory?\n\n**ROB:** To be honest, not too long.\n\n**AS:** What\u2019s going to happen once we reach that point?\n\n**ROB:** We\u2019re gonna keep drivin\u2019.\n\n**AS:** Until we get to the end?\n\n**ROB:** That\u2019s the plan. You know I won\u2019t judge you if you wanna turn around. I\u2019m sure you can talk someone into it.\n\n**AS:** Could I talk you into it?\n\nRob smiles.\n\n**ROB:** \u2018Fraid not. This trip ain\u2019t like the others. Road\u2019s kickin\u2019 back like never before. I think it knows I\u2019m comin\u2019 all the way this time.\n\n**AS:** \u2026 What is this place Rob?\n\nRob sighs as he slowly takes the next left on a quiet, rural T-junction.\n\n**ROB:** I think it\u2019s a stray thread\u2026 runnin\u2019 off the spool.\n\nThe radio crackles.\n\n**BONNIE:** Rob you just took the wrong turn.\n\nAn instant drum of fresh panic hammers in my chest. I stare at Rob, and he stares right back. I know he\u2019s feeling the same thing I am, though he\u2019s doing a much better job of keeping it off his face.\n\nHe thinks carefully for a moment.\n\n**ROB:** No\u2026 no. I been down this road before. We took a right last time.\n\n**AS:** Uhhh\u2026 yeah. Yes. The turn before this one was a right, I remember.\n\n**ROB:** Ferryman to all cars. Thanks Bonnie for giving us the fright of our lives. We\u2019re on the righ\u2026 we\u2019re on the correct road.\n\n**BONNIE:** No no that can\u2019t be its\u2026 that\u2019s wrong\u2026 Martin tell them\u2026\n\n**CLYDE:** Our mistake Rob, let\u2019s keep going.\n\n**LILITH:** Bristol\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s concern in Lilith\u2019s voice. I lean over to my wing mirror, attempting to gauge the atmosphere in the car behind me. There\u2019s clearly some commotion between Bonnie and Clyde, with the latter attempting to gently remove the walkie talkie from his sister\u2019s hands.\n\nThere\u2019s something else however. Past Bonnie &amp; Clyde. Past Bluejay. An old, dilapidated road sign made of weathered timber stands by the side of the road behind us. I can\u2019t read all of it as the peeling letters grow ever smaller, but I can piece together what it probably once said.\n\n\u201cWintery Bay \u2013 5 Miles\u201d\n\n**BONNIE:** We\u2019re going to turn around right?\n\n**AS:** Uhh one second Bonnie, I\u2019ll\u2026 check the map.\n\nI promptly switch off the radio.\n\n**AS:** Are we not passing through Wintery Bay?\n\nRob turns to me, a puzzled look in his eyes.\n\n**ROB:** Through where?\n\nIn the wake of those two, innocently inquiring words, my mind reels back to the morning of our third day on the road. Watching Bonnie and Clyde wander over to Rob to confess their transgressions with the hitchhiker, the quiet conversation that passed between them, Rob\u2019s seemingly comforting response. I\u2019d felt wretched in those moments. A few minutes prior I had tricked and deceived Clyde\u2026 yet I\u2019d never once considered he might have done the same to me.\n\n**AS:** Is it safe to pull over?\n\n**ROB:** What? Why?\n\n**AS:** Is it safe Rob?\n\n**ROB:** Uh, yeah should be.\n\n**AS:** Then pull over.\n\nI switch the radio back on and grab the receiver. As I make a connection to Bonnie and Clyde\u2019s car, it\u2019s clear that an argument is brewing. Lilith is asking for me, a helpless passenger, caught in the middle of something she doesn\u2019t understand.\n\n**AS:** Bristol to all cars. We\u2019re stopping up ahead.\n\nRob seems acutely aware that I\u2019m not messing around. As soon as we roll to a halt, I throw my door open and jump onto the dusty roadside, striding over to the rest of the convoy, who are just starting to get out of their own cars. I\u2019m conscious of a driving anger behind each step I take.\n\n**AS:** You didn\u2019t tell him.\n\n**CLYDE:** Bristol, I\u2026\n\n**ROB:** What\u2019s goin\u2019 on Bristol?\n\nRob\u2019s marches up behind me, more than a little restless to get a grip on my motives.\n\n**AS:** Clyde?\n\nClyde looks around a circle of expectant eyes. When he delivers his answer, he\u2019s unable to meet any of them.\n\n**CLYDE:** Bonnie\u2026 Bonnie talked to the hitchhiker.\n\nRob\u2019s expression shifts, his confusion degrading into a solemn understanding.\n\n**ROB:** God\u2026 ahh Goddamnit. You knew about this Bristol?\n\n**AS:** I told them to tell you the morning of the third day. I saw them go over to you I\u2026 I thought they did.\n\n**CLYDE:** Bonnie\u2026 thought you\u2019d\u2026 turn us around.\n\n**ROB:** Well she\u2019s was damn right. You seen what happens when the rules get broken. You shoulda told me as soon as you saw me and headed right back home.\n\n**CLYDE:** That was before Ace\u2026 before everything. I didn\u2019t know this place was-\n\n**ROB:** The rules are the rules Clyde! Is anything even wrong with Bonnie? You said she gets confused... was that a lie?\n\nClyde doesn\u2019t answer, avoiding Rob\u2019s glare. As I process what Rob\u2019s just said, I have to say I\u2019m surprised by the deviousness of the two siblings.\n\nWhen I thought they were telling Rob about the hitchhiker, it appears they\u2019d instead told him that Bonnie was, to some degree, senile. It was a simple lie, but one that would adequately explain her odd behaviour, draw sympathy from Rob and, most ingeniously, prevent him from telling me about their conversation. A truth buried beneath an unpleasant lie, its subject matter just uncomfortable enough to head off any chance of discussion.\n\nStill, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\n**CLYDE:** We can head home if you want.\n\n**BONNIE:** No.\n\nThe group turns to Bonnie. She speaks in a tone more decisive than I thought her capable.\n\n**BONNIE:** He... the hitchhiker... he was talking about a\u2026 about the village we just passed. I was looking forward to seeing it, that\u2019s all. I\u2019m ok really.\n\n**AS:** You\u2019ve been talking about it a lot Bonnie.\n\n**BONNIE:** It just sounded like a lovely place, I was sad that we passed it by. I\u2019m sorry for worrying everyone. Please don\u2019t make us turn around Rob.\n\nRob stares at them both. His position has been made crystal clear.\n\n**ROB:** We\u2019re stopping a little early today. Come the rest of the way with us, rest up\u2026 then tomorrow you both go home. You should count yourselves lucky you get the chance to turn around.\n\nRob marches back to the Wrangler, signalling that the discussion is over.\n\n**ROB:** Lilith, you\u2019re with us.\n\nLilith doesn't even try to hide her relief as she shuffles away from Bonnie &amp; Clyde and climbs into the back of the Jeep. It\u2019s a little heart warming that Rob still has the awareness to look out for her, angry as he may be.\n\nAs well as his surprising strength, I also tend to forget how perceptive he can be.\n\nBonnie, Clyde and Bluejay climb back into their respective vehicles. I catch Bonnie\u2019s eye, the moment before she returns to the Ford. She appears truly disappointed, but otherwise resigned to keep going, satisfied to let Wintery Bay fade into the distance. It\u2019s comforting to hear that she\u2019s ready to put the place behind her.\n\nIt\u2019s just a pity I don\u2019t believe a word of it.\n\n*****\n\n**LILITH:** It was fucking weird Bristol.\n\nLilith seems happy to be in the Wrangler, enjoying the sense of security the modded behemoth affords, and also greatly relieved to be away from Bonnie &amp; Clyde. She\u2019s spent the last five minutes detailing the thirty second argument that unfolded between them, charting its disturbing nuances as well as it\u2019s eerie conclusion.\n\n**LILITH:** ... but I swear she was basically like crying like\u2026 she didn\u2019t understand how we could be going the wrong way. But then like, as soon as you pulled us over and she just stopped. Like I mean\u2026 stopped.\n\n**AS:** That must have been disconcerting.\n\n**LILITH:** You have no idea... So Rob, when are these cornfields gonna fucking end?\n\n**ROB:** Soon. We\u2019re gonna rest up for the night in a few turns. Then tomorrow it won\u2019t be long until we\u2019re on a track through the woods.\n\n**LILITH:** The fucking woods? Are you kidding? Are we talking like\u2026 Sleepy Hollow bleeding trees or what?\n\n**ROB:** Hah, wish I could tell ya.\n\n**LILITH:** Wait, what do you mean?\n\n**ROB:** I ain\u2019t been that far yet. It\u2019s new territory.\n\n**LILITH:** Oh\u2026 great. Maybe the cornfields aren\u2019t so\u2026\n\nLilith goes quiet, transfixed by something in the rear view mirror, before quickly turning around to get a better look out of the back window.\n\nThe car behind us is out of control.\n\nBonnie is fighting to wrest the steering wheel from her brother. The Ford swerves erratically behind us, driven mad by the dynamic power struggle taking place inside it. Rob sharply accelerates out of the way as the car behind lurches drunkenly to and fro before skidding to a shuddering halt. Rob hits the brake hard, and by the time I\u2019ve turned in his direction, he\u2019s already slammed the door of the Wrangler, storming across the tarmac to Bonnie and Clyde. \n\n**ROB:** Cut the engine!\n\nThe Ford\u2019s engine goes silent and in the absence of its rumbling growl, new sounds emerge. The sounds of a struggle, and of wild desperate screaming.\n\nStepping out of the car for the second time today, I jump onto the road and cover the distance between us.\n\nRob is attempting to pull a screeching Bonnie from the car. Even with his impressive strength it seems to be a challenge. Bonnie claws at the walls, trying with all her might to regain her grasp on the steering wheel.\n\n**BONNIE:** Please! PLEASE! Let me go! Let me go! \n\nRob extracts Bonnie from the car and attempts to subdue her amidst a flurry of flailing hands and elbows. She writhes and kicks as he pins her arms to her sides.\n\n**AS:** Bonnie! Bonnie. Calm down ok? Let\u2019s talk this through.\n\n**BONNIE:** He told me it was on our way! He said we\u2019d pass through!\n\n**ROB:** He lied Bonnie.\n\n**BONNIE:** No\u2026 no we\u2019re going the wrong way. We\u2019re going the wrong way!\n\nBonnie lashes out again, striking at Rob\u2019s legs with her own. Rob holds her firmly, hit teeth gritted through every impact.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Bonnie isn\u2019t going to let up. I run back to the Wrangler and open up the trunk. After a few moments of rummaging through my bag, I find the first aid kit and pull out an unopened pack of white zip ties.\n\n**AS:** Clyde, open the back door.\n\nRob sees me standing with the zip ties. Even in the midst of Bonnie\u2019s incessant struggle, he looks at me with an almost questioning air, as if he\u2019s wondering how we ever arrived at this point. As if he\u2019s asking whether we can really do what I\u2019m wordlessly suggesting.\n\nBonnie answers the last question for him. In the slim few seconds of distraction, she slams her head back into his nose, eliciting a disgustingly loud thud and a pained growl from Rob. Dazed and confused, his nose immediately fountaining blood, Rob manages to keep his arms wrapped around her. But it\u2019s clear this isn\u2019t going to be sustainable, and that she isn\u2019t anywhere close to calming down.\n\nClyde has opened the door, stepping back and looking on like a frightened child as we carry Bonnie over to the back seat of the Ford. I lean in before him, adjusting the headrest until it\u2019s pressed against the ceiling, ensuring that it can\u2019t be removed from the bracket. I then loop a zip tie around each bracket and fasten them.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** What the fuck is going on?\n\nBluejay has stepped out of her car, making her way towards us. I realise that, to someone who is fighting to not believe in any of this, the following scene would appear at best as a melodramatic farce, and at worst, as the attempted detention of an innocent and distressed woman.\n\nSadly, I don\u2019t have time to field her questions. I climb into the car. Bonnie working constantly against us as Rob eases her in after me, his hand on her head to prevent it bumping against the top of the doorframe.\n\nOnce she\u2019s inside, I loop a second zip tie around the one I\u2019ve already fastened on the right bracket, forcing her right hand inside it. I pull the plastic tab over the sleeve of her jumper.\n\nI hope it\u2019s not too tight, but at the very least it\u2019s secure enough to keep her in place. Bonnie continues to pull against the zip ties, but it\u2019s clear her strength has been sapped from her spirited battle with Rob.\n\nNot quite able to look her in the eye, I push a pile of luggage out of the way and climb out the other side of the Ford. Rob and I are both getting our breath back, the former pinching his nose and adjusting stoically to the fresh pain.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** Hey what the fuck are\u2026 you\u2019re not going to leave her like that are you?\n\n**AS:** Get back in your car Bluejay.\n\nI walk back to the Wrangler, tuning out Denise\u2019s coarse protests. Rob reaches into the Jeep\u2019s still open trunk, and pulls out a pile of blankets and pillows. In the rear view mirror, I can see him placing them on Bonnie\u2019s lap, giving her a place to rest her elbows.\n\nShe leans her forehead against the back of the headrest. Even with her face blocked from view, I can tell that she\u2019s crying.\n\nWe arrive at the rest stop some twenty minutes later, the vague outline of a deep green forest blooming on the horizon. It\u2019s earlier in the day than we would usually stop. Rob tells us he wants the entirety of tomorrow to chart the woods, as well as good time to turn back before night fall should the need arise. I\u2019m not complaining, I\u2019m glad of the chance to rest up following today\u2019s events.\n\nFor the rest of the day, we take it in turns to keep an eye on Bonnie, making sure she has everything she needs. When the Ford pulled up alongside us, Lilith, Rob, and I expected to see a quivering wreck, tugging ceaselessly against her bonds. We were all surprised, and more than a little disturbed, to find her smiling. By the time my turn comes around, the sun is already dipping in the sky. Rob has prepared a small pot of miso soup in case anyone can bring themselves to eat. I finish my bowl, all too aware of how unnecessary each meal now feels, and pour out a helping for Bonnie.\n\nI find her in good spirits.\n\n**BONNIE:** How are you doing Alice?\n\n**AS:** I\u2019m fine. How are you doing Linda?\n\n**BONNIE:** I\u2019m ok. Sorry for giving you all such a fright earlier. I feel terrible.\n\n**AS:** It\u2019s fine honestly. I\u2019m sorry about\u2026 about all this.\n\nI gesture to the zip tied restraints. Rob has reapplied them, fastening bandages underneath the straps to afford Bonnie a modicum of comfort. Still the scene rings with a sinister barbarity which no kind consideration can make up for. \n\n**BONNIE:** It\u2019s ok. I wasn\u2019t myself.\n\n**AS:** I brought you soup. I know you might not be hungry.\n\n**BONNIE:** No no I\u2019d love some, thank you. Everyone\u2019s being so lovely.\n\n**AS:** Well, we just want to make sure you\u2019re alright.\n\nI submerge the spoon, drench up a measure of warm broth, and begin to raise it towards her.\n\n**BONNIE:** Oh no you don\u2019t have to\u2026 I can feed myself\u2026\n\nShe gestures to her bound hands, the clear implication hanging in the air.\n\n**AS:** No I\u2026 I don\u2019t mind. I think it\u2019s-\n\nBonnie throws her weight sideways, her elbow jabbing outwards and hitting the bowl out of my hands. Soup spills over my fleece, just a little cooler than scolding hot, and soaks immediately into the fabric. I back away reflexively, and watch Bonnie\u2019s expression flicker like a faulty lightbulb from kind tranquility to utter, burning contempt. It\u2019s gone as quickly as it appears, just in time for the rest of the group to look our way.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** What are you doing with her?!\n\nBluejay storms across from her car, angrily drawing from a Marlboro and forcing the smoke draconically back into the air.\n\n**AS:** Nothing. Just an accident.\n\n**BONNIE:** It\u2019s ok Bluejay, it was my mistake.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** Did she get any on you?\n\nBluejay leans in placing her hand comfortingly on Bonnie\u2019s, before turning to fix me with a murderous stare. It\u2019s almost impressive how, even when caring for someone, Bluejay still manages to be simultaneously venomous to those around her.\n\n**BONNIE:** No no it\u2019s ok it was my fault. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m sorry for causing trouble.\n\nBluejay laughs at Bonnie\u2019s submissive apology, unable to believe what she's thinking. Her eyes remain fixed on me.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** You\u2019re a fucking coward. Look what he\u2019s making you do. Look!\n\nMy eyes follow where she gestures. I have to admit the helpless figure of Bonnie, restrained in the back seat of the Ford, rings with an innate inhumanity, and being forced to stare my actions in the face makes me feel utterly ghoulish.\n\nThe choices I\u2019ve made must seem insane to Bluejay, but that doesn\u2019t mean hers are not. Despite her pretensions of rationality, I can\u2019t help but feel that Bluejay\u2019s actions are simply being governed by a different insanity. An insanity borne out of the desperate need to explain the unexplainable, which has morphed into an ugly cocktail of paranoia, self-grandeur, and fervent antagonism.\n\nBluejay notes my silent expression, most likely taking it as a personal victory. Without another word she returns to her car and shuts herself inside, festering silently and alone.\n\n**BONNIE:** Do you want to know what\u2019s wonderful Alice?\n\nBonnie leans towards me, lowering her voice so no one else can hear.\n\n**BONNIE:** He told me there\u2019s a house\u2026 waiting for me. My home by the sea.\n\n**AS:** I\u2019m sorry Bonnie. I don\u2019t think there is.\n\n**BONNIE:** It\u2019s going to be a such a beautiful place. Such a beautiful place.\n\nBonnie flashes me a broad grin. \n\n**BONNIE:** It\u2019s been lovely knowing you Alice.\n\nBonnie turns away from me, placing her forehead back on the headrest. The grin doesn\u2019t fade as I turn away. I walk back to the Wrangler, faced with the choice of changing into new clothes or my thermal pyjamas.\n\nAfter removing my fleece and lying down for a just a moment, I end up sleeping in the clothes I\u2019m wearing.\n\n*****\n\nWhen I wake up, the Wrangler is moving. \n\nThe air mattress reverberates and my body rocks as we make a sharp U-turn. I sit bolt upright, Lilith waking up next to me, similarly bleary eyed and confused.\n\nRob is behind the wheel. The gear stick shakes as he transports us down the road at incredible speed.\n\n**AS:** Rob what\u2019s happening?\n\n**ROB:** Bonnie got herself free. She\u2019s headed for the turn.\n\nI pull myself into the passenger seat, suddenly wide awake.\n\n**LILITH:** What? How did she get free?\n\n**AS:** Is she with Clyde?\n\n**ROB:** She hit him over the head, dragged him outta the car. I couldn\u2019t wait for him, but he\u2019s catchin\u2019 up.\n\nLilith and I turn around. Bluejay\u2019s car is gaining on us, a distant pair of high beams steadily drowning the rear window in light.\n\n**LILITH:** Why\u2019s Bluejay helping him?\n\n**AS:** She probably wants to keep an eye on us. Rob, do you think we\u2019ll catch up with Bonnie?\n\n**ROB:** I\u2019m workin\u2019 on it.\n\nThe Wrangler continues to rocket through the darkness. We keep our eyes fixed forward, scanning the very edge of the horizon for any sign of Bonnie\u2019s Ford.\n\nWhen Bluejay pulls alongside us, I get a look at the pair. Bluejay is nought but steely determination, dedicated to reaching Bonnie before we do. Clyde looks mortified, rocked by his sister\u2019s actions, a small contusion on his head to mark her vicious betrayal.\n\nRob screeches to a halt once we arrive at the junction. Bluejay\u2019s headlights are already illuminating the road to Wintery Bay, and Rob\u2019s lighting rig coats the entire area in an artificial twilight. In the middle of it all, we see Bonnie, standing next to her car, smiling.\n\nShe\u2019s already beyond the threshold of the turn.\n\n**CLYDE:** Linda! Linda, please\u2026 come on back now, ok?\n\n**BONNIE:** You can all come with me. There\u2019s a place for all of us. He told me. There\u2019s a place for everyone.\n\n**CLYDE:** Please Linda. You have to come back.\n\nA strange trail of black dust is streaming off Bonnie\u2019s skin, rising into the air and dancing in the breeze. After a moment, it becomes clear that the edges of Bonnie are slowly degrading, converting quietly into dark ash and drifting into the atmosphere.\n\n**BONNIE:** I love you very much Martin. You\u2019re always welcome.\n\n**CLYDE:** No please\u2026 please.\n\nBonnie turns around and climbs into the car. Without looking back, she pulls away down the road to Wintery Bay. The trail of black particles rise from the Ford as she goes, with greater and greater volume as the entire car starts to wither away before our eyes. Less than a minute later the Ford, with Bonnie inside it, gradually dissolves into dust and scatters to the winds.\n\nClyde doesn't speak. His entire being is quiet. Lilith immediately runs back to the Wrangler. Rob waits a while, staring at he dancing cloud of dust, before putting his arm around Clyde and gently escorting him to the Jeep. \n\nAs I turn away from the road to Wintery Bay, I take note of Bluejay\u2019s reaction. She looks absolutely petrified, more so than I\u2019ve ever seen her. She impulsively removes the pack of Marlboros from her pocket and holds them in her hands, before quickly returning them, unsmoked.\n\nThe night passes slowly after we return to the rest stop. All of us are exhausted, and more than willing to surrender to the escapism of sleep. Rob rests in the driver\u2019s seat, giving up his space on the air mattress to Clyde. Everyone drops quickly enough into a quiet slumber, leaving me awake with only my thoughts for company. I find myself thinking of Bluejay, of how she could possibly hope to rationalise the disintegration of Bonnie and her car. \n\nI wonder how I\u2019d feel if the Left/Right Game were exposed as some unparalleled magic trick. Would I feel foolish? No I don\u2019t think so. Impressed, maybe. Relieved? Most definitely. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I miss the innocent days when I believed the game was a hoax. I suppose I see why Bluejay is so adamant about dismissing this place; trickery however elaborate is almost always a preferable alternative to genuine horror.\n\nThe Jeep\u2019s door opens and shuts \n\nPart of me tries to ignore it, to wash my hands of any other developments in this harrowing night. However, exiled as I am from the kingdom of sleep, I slowly find myself sitting up, quietly putting on my boots, and letting myself out.\n\nI step out into the cool night, observing the figure before me.\n\n**AS:** Where are you going Clyde?\n\nClyde turns to face me, I initially interpret the look he gives me as one of resignation, but the word doesn\u2019t quite fit. Resignation is a defeat, the world exacting compliance from you against your own wishes. But the man before me is as calm as the night air around him. His wishes are clearly his own. There\u2019s no defeat in his eyes, but something else entirely\u2026 peace, maybe.\n\n**CLYDE:** You know where I\u2019m going Alice.\n\nClyde speaks softly, a quiet conviction behind every word he says. I briefly glance towards the Wrangler, wondering if I\u2019m really equipped to handle this on my own.\n\n**CLYDE:** Don\u2019t call Rob. I made a mistake coming back to the rest stop. I shouldn\u2019t have done... please. Just let me go.\n\n**AS:** Clyde, just wait for tomorrow ok? He\u2019ll understand. He\u2019ll turn us around and take you home.\n\n**CLYDE:** It won't be home anymore.\n\nClyde\u2019s gentle stare renders me silent.\n\n**CLYDE:** Linda had a husband once. He was a good man. Died young. She could never bring herself to go looking again and I\u2026 I never found who I was looking for. We\u2019ve been by each other\u2019s side for sixty years. Sixty years. I gotta be honest, even after all we\u2019ve been through, everything you and I have seen, I never felt like I was in a new world until now.\n\n**AS:** I don\u2019t think I can\u2019t let you do this Clyde.\n\n**CLYDE:** I\u2019m sorry Alice, but it\u2019s not up to you.\n\nClyde breathes in the cool night air, exhaling through his nose.\n\n**CLYDE:** I yelled at her to come back, when she ran off to rob that ice cream parlour. I kept calling out and calling out. I spent so much energy trying to get her to come back to me. After a while I realised she wasn\u2019t coming back\u2026 that I\u2019d have to follow her. I should\u2019ve realised it earlier. That\u2019s all I can do.... follow where she goes.\n\nClyde looks at me, almost apologetically.\n\n**CLYDE:** Goodbye Alice.\n\nHe turns away from the convoy and wanders back down the road.\n\n**AS:** Clyde.\n\nHe turns around one last time.\n\n**AS:** Do you want company?\n\nIt takes roughly an hour for us to walk back to the junction. In the time we have, I\u2019m treated to the story of Bonnie and Clyde. The warmest fragments of their life together, the moments that built them, the waves that rocked them and the places they once called home. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever agree with what Clyde is doing, but the more he talks, the more I understand.\n\nHis stories span more than half a century, supported by a transient cast of acquaintances and friends, but at the core of each tale is a pair of siblings who meant the world to one another. The pair existed as two relative souls, quantifiable only in relation to each other. In the absence of one, the remnant was indefinable. A drifting point, unanchored in space.\n\nThe story ends just as we reach the junction\n\n**AS:** I hope she's out there.\n\n**CLYDE:** I hope so too. Thank you for coming with me, I know it\u2019s late.\n\n**AS:** No\u2026 it\u2019s never a bad time to see a friend off.\n\nClyde smiles at me one last time before turning to face the road. He steps over the threshold, past the old wooden sign. In the silence of the night, I hear nothing but his soft footsteps and the quiet breeze, which after a few minutes carries the last of him into an open sky.\n\nIt\u2019s a long walk back to the convoy. My mind is numb to fear as I make my way through the dark, the corn rustling in the wind beside me.\n\nIt\u2019s been four days since I arrived at Rob Guthard\u2019s house, sat down at his table, and listened to him speak about the new world he\u2019d discovered. In that time, I\u2019ve seen things I can\u2019t hope to comprehend, sights that exist beyond the spectrum of our reality. Things I wouldn't have deemed possible.\n\nFor all I know there is a Wintery Bay, and Bonnie has already arrived at her house by the sea, standing at the door, waiting with quiet confidence for her brother\u2019s arrival.\n\nI may never know. But I do hope they find each other, wherever they may be.",

Would fit the motive: He knows more about the road than he is telling the others, and he tries to hide where he got that knowledge from.\n\nIf you think about it, it makes sense: If he had ignored the hitchhiker before and nothing bad happend, why not tell the others?\nOn the other hand, if he just knew the hitchhiker would get in the car anyways, but not what happens afterwards, why tell them? He would only reveal that he knows more than he should, there is no benefit in safety for the group.\nBut when Ace (seemingly) survived breaking the rules, it would make sense from Robs perspective to lie: What if the other group members do not listen to him anymore, as it seems like nothing happens to you when you break the rules?\n\nWhat we can say for sure (almost) is that he did not know Ace was going to die. If he knew, he would not have tried to save him. The character seems just to practicle to \"act out\" a rescue effort.\n\nAlso, it is very unlikely that Rob just figured out this part of the rules by trial and error. Imagine him playing the game for the first time: The hitchhiker would have ended up in his car, no matter if he chose to pick him up or not. From this point on, if he talked to him, took anything, even followed simple requests like opening the door for him, he would have ended as dust in Wintery Bay, just like Bonnie.\nTo sum it up: Rob knew about the Hitchhiker and the rules of how to handle him, even *before* playing the game for the first time. He maybe did not know what happens if you break the rules, but he certainly knew the rules.\n\nBy the way, the same thing when they encounter the \"greywoman\". He seems to know that ignoring her will not kill you. So he just tells AS to ignore her. Not revealing why he knows, what would happen if you do not ignore her or anything else.\n\nTL;DR: Rob knows stuff.",

We don't know anything about the first time Rob played the game, other than what he's volunteered so far. We don't know if he was alone on the road, or even alone in the car. There's evidence that hints at Rob being involved in a car crash close to the area where the hitchhiker is, maybe that was his consequence for not picking up the hitchhiker? He would surely know better the next time.\nAlso, we don't know if the hitchhiker affects everyone who acknowledges him in the same way. Maybe they don't all go to Wintery Bay. Maybe they crash their car and are lucky to survive?\n\nI don't think we can necessarily conclude that Rob knew all the rules before he played the first game. Maybe the consequences for breaking the rules weren't as severe his first time as they are now, which is why trial and error was in fact possible at first. Rob did theorise that the number of people may have an effect on the severity of the roads push-back.\n\nSo yes, I agree that it is possible that Ace's death was a punishment for not picking up the hitchhiker, but I really don't believe that Rob knew and didn't tell.",

Perhaps the rules get more harsh and the punishment gets more severe for ignoring the hitchhiker and other entities on the road. Remember when they passed through Jubilation and Rob said that the residents never acknowledge them? I don't think he was lying. At this point, his motive is to get them to the unexplored territory which is why he's so specific about everyone following his rules. So if Jubilation was a place to watch out for, he'd tell them. So when they all looked at the convoy I had a feeling it was because of Ace. Maybe it was just convenient that Bluejay took her time to get her car over and Ace got stuck.. maybe if Ace had made it over the truck would have crashed into him. I don't know for sure but I when I read that particular installment that was my hunch. \n\nAnd my second theory which is a bit more far fetched is that maybe the first time Rob ignored the hitchhiker he wasn't driving. He might have been the passenger and he could have encouraged/agreed with the driver to not pick up the hitchhiker. If the rule is that the driver is the one who is affected then it's possible Rob's companion died and he made it out alive. ",

The premise is that a group of documentarians set out to explore the vast forests that cover the planet instead of oceans. The further in they go, the weirder things get including hallucinations, strange noises, and most disturbingly, people randomly showing up and leaving the party. Each time, no one in the party acknowledges the change until the end. Even then, you're not sure if the narrator is finally becoming aware of preternatural events, or if they've had a complete nervous breakdown. The ending is ambiguous in that satisfying yet frustrating way that really well done short stories manage to pull off. I highly recommend it.",

Especially this:\n\n&gt;His stories span more than half a century, supported by a transient cast of acquaintances and friends, but at the core of each tale is a pair of siblings who meant the world to one another. The pair existed as two relative souls, quantifiable only in relation to each other. In the absence of one, the remnant was indefinable. A drifting point, unanchored in space.\n\nThis line here made me feel so many emotions at once, but the strongest of them all was an ineffable feeling of loneliness. It's amazing how the narrator can develop such heart rending characterizations in so few words.\n\nI hope to eventually develop even a fraction of OP's skill as a writer. I could gush for paragraphs about my love for this story, but all I can do is wait eagerly for the next update.",

That would explain how the logs got through.\n\nIn order of likelihood:\n\n1. Rob. I know most everyone thinks that Rob is in cahoots with the road but if my theory comes to fruition, a log narrated from Rob's perspective would tell us a lot. \n\n2. Alice. I mean, she's been narrating so far, and she is resourceful enough to pull this off. \n\n3. Denise. That would be surely unexpected but if she gets herself together she will definetely want to destroy the road. \n\n4. Jen. She definitely has the motive and the rage powering her but... I just don't think it's likely\n\nEdit: I also wonder if Bluejay helped Bonnie get free?\n\nEdit 2: btw, I just checked and the first log does say the game was posted in June 2016.

Think about it; if the road is infinite and Rob's obsession with it has always put him on a path to finally 'come all the way,' then the chances are that \"becoming one with the road\" is equivalent to infinitely traveling left/right down it and facing it - this would explain why the road slows down time/gas/food/resource usage. The eventual endpoint is an infinite run down the road. So if he sends Alice back, it's because it means he's going to be the last one to travel the road. \n\nThis would also explain why he brought the whole party of people along, the film crew, the skepticist, the writer.

Interestingly, from what Wikipedia tells me, historically Clyde was the first to be killed in the ambush (this affirmation is to be taken with a bit of salt, of course). Even in history, their names are forever tied. They exist only as a couple, just like our brother-sister team.\n\nAlice: Well, Alice in Wonderland is obviously the first thing to come to mind, which could hint at her survival, as Alice safely left Wonderland. I think it is also interesting to note that the literary Alice was very much a passive spectator during her journey, following a path she didn't really understand and \"going with the flow\", so to speak. Our Alice, conserving her professionalism, does the same as much as possible, *and* so far she has been following her White Rabbit - Rob.",

This is what I thought as well after reading the comment just above yours that explained they were both wives of Adam. Which would explain my initial inkling that Lilith would be the one to survive from the incident in the last post. \n\n&gt;On the other hand, they're heading into territory that Rob is unfamiliar with, so weird individual rules are likely to come up\n\nI think this is very likely. Also, do you think Bluejay has heard the voice too? I remember Alice heard it when she was doubting the legitimacy of the road but ever since she has started believing in the reality of the road more and more, the voice hasn't spoken to her. Considering Bluejay only joined in to debunk this whole thing, maybe she heard the voice too and chalked it up to cheap tricks.\n\nMakes me wonder.\n",

However, the sender would have to know about OP, who, lets not forget, was Alice's old roommate. Meaning: whoever sent the logs had to have had some sort of heart-to-heart conversation with Alice to find out about OP... which seems more likely of Lilith. Or... Bluejay or Lilith sent the logs to someone else who sent them to OP.

            "comment": "I woke up at 3:00 AM today *and* yesterday thinking about this story.\n\nI have spent too much time this morning pouring through the comments section trying to identify everybody who's said something that inspired this comment, and I'm pretty sure I didn't find everyone.  Apologies to anyone I leave out.\n\nI don't remember exactly who the first person was who began suggesting \"Name Game\" level analysis of the characters' call signs, and said \"Maybe I'm over analyzing,\"  but I think it's pretty apparent that they were on to something.  u/dragonkittymeower  gave us interpretations for Eve, Lillith, and Apollo, as well as  \"Bonnie\" as in \"My Bonnie lies over the ocean.\"  u/VioletThunderX has had a lot of perceptive things to say, including comments on this topic.  u/David_the_Wanderer  explicated on Bonnie and Clyde and Alice as in \"wonderland\".  u/grimmcild said \"Bristol = Bridge\"., giving us *two* possible extensions for that character's names, in combo with \"Alice in Wonderland.\"  u/Robots914 notices possible extensions on Rob's callsign  \"The Ferryman\" (and was inb4 me on that 'cause that's what I woke up this morning at 3 thinking about).  \n\nAny text that gives meaningful extensions to this kind of analysis is a rewarding text in my book and hats off to all the u/s who have such careful eyes.\n\nI've made a couple of these  points already this morning in replies to other comments, but I wanted to put them all in one place, here, as well.\n\nFirst, I think it's possible that Alice/Bristol (or possibly Bluejay) ends up being Greywoman.  I first went back and looked at her dialogue yesterday or Saturday, and other than the fact that she says \"bad things are going to happen\" and they do, there isn't a very specific correlation between what she said and what we've seen so far -- so I think we should be on the lookout for some upcoming events that give sense to her statement, \"He wanted to leave me so I cut him out. The lake was hungry it drank the wound clean,\" almost certainly involving Rob.  It does seem pretty apt to think of the journey up/down the road so far as \"dancing down the lion's tongue.\"  Thanks to u/ChevroletSparkSS for the comment that lead me to guess that Greywoman might be Alice or Bluejay.\n\nSecond, and here I don't have the references to the u/'s who made the observations I'm reacting to, sorry: I feel like the amount of ambiguity about Rob's backstory leaves a number of interpretations still wide open, mostly in response to how it is that he has apparently broken the rules of the road in the past and survived vis-a-vis just how long it is he's being playing the game, and with who.  Did he know the Hitchhiker rule because he first read it on the forum directions, because he actually didn't pick up the hitchhiker as he claims, or because he first was a passenger in a car that didn't pick up the hitchhiker? (sorry to the u/ who put this idea out that I'm not citing.)\n\nDid Ace die because he broke the hitchhiker rule?  As several u/s have noted, there are many possible explanations as to how it was Ace ended up with a hook in his head, but if he died solely because he broke the hitchhiker rule, how come Rob didn't know that?  I believe Rob was genuinely surprised by Ace's fate.\n\nIt strikes me, just now, that the deaths of the rule-breakers have gotten progressively more bizarre, from Ace's hook through the head (Oh, that's gross!) to being swallowed up by asphalt (\"Holy Sh!t!!! That's weird!\") to molecular disintegration (\"Well... didn't see that coming.\")  I shudder to think about what might be next.\n\nFINALLY: I submit that the call-sign \"Ace\" was a nod to the *first* death.  \n\nCheers!\n\nTL:DR \"Ace\" was called \"Ace\" because he was the first card taken out of the game.\n ",

We can\u2019t really prove that Eve, Apollo, Bonnie and Clyde have actually died, and I\u2019m skeptical because Clyde just kept walking as he was turned to dust.\n\nAce, though, the only explanation I would have for him being taken is because he ignored the hitchhiker. Perhaps rules like the hitchhiker serve as trials, and Ace failed. But didn\u2019t Rob say he ignored him once, too?",

I don't blame her now especially since they both didn't know the game was that dangerous in the first place.",

I never knew a story could be comparable to heroin. I guess a story is definetly the healthier way to go,  but the wait between is killing me. At least with drugs i knew when i could get them lol.  But thankfully i don't feel so sick i can't get out of bed when waiting for the next part of the story. ;) ",

    "postText": "You probably think that all doctors are filthy rich, because I sure as hell did in the beginning. Eight years and a fistful of premature gray hairs later, I\u2019m just a few hundred thousand dollars poorer than \u201cbroke.\u201d That would matter if I had a family to provide for, but the long hours in med school have led to an end of my last relationship and a countdown on the shelf life of my ovaries. \n\nI was in a \u201ctake what I can get and be grateful\u201d situation. \n\nSo when St. Francis Hospital in Charleston, West Virginia offered me a position, I packed my sad life into three bags and sought opportunity in the hills of Appalachia. Nineteen of us started in July, and thirteen have since dropped out. \n\nI like to think of myself as the rat that wouldn\u2019t drown.\n\nSome people broke inside after watching children die because they weren\u2019t good enough doctors quite yet (everyone has to be a rookie at some point). It\u2019s doubly hard when you have to inform the dead child\u2019s parents, who then beg you to tell them different news, or scream that they want to die and just please kill them with whatever drug takes away the pain.\n\nBut most of my incoming class couldn\u2019t handle the chief of medicine. \n\nDr. Vivian Scritt is, without a doubt, the biggest bitch I\u2019ve ever met. \n\nNow I know why.\n\n\u201cNineteen of you start today, and we\u2019ve got a pool going with bets on how long each of you will last,\u201d she told us on Day One. \u201cDon\u2019t feel any pressure, folks. I\u2019ve talked with each of you in private, and my expectations are very low.\u201d \n\nShe peered condescendingly over her thin spectacles, snorted, then turned around to walk away. \n\n\u201cYou should know when to follow me and when to stay away, because I\u2019m not going to waste time explaining what you should figure out on your own.\u201d\n\nWe gawked at one another, all feeling weak and small, then scampered after her. \n\nI was last in line, and felt out of place taking even that much.   \n \n\u201cYou should have the list of expectations for St. Francis,\u201d Dr. Scritt explained as she walked on, not bothering to look at us as she talked. \u201cI printed eighteen sets of rules so that you would have to challenge one another for them, knowing that one of you would be left behind.\u201d\n\nAn icy cold settled in the pit of my stomach as I saw everyone look down at a list of rules that only I did not have. \n\n\u201cIf you cannot follow these rules, there will be no place for you in this hospital. It most likely means that you are unsuited to be a doctor, and should consider a profession that demands a weaker mental aptitude.\u201d At that, she turned around to face us all. \u201cAnd if you think that I\u2019m the type to give second chances after a mistake, you\u2019re woefully underprepared for the world of medicine.\u201d She stopped and looked at each of us in turn, apparently expecting a response that no one dared to offer.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she shot out in exasperation, \u201cwhy are you standing here? People are dying. Get to work!\u201d\n\n*\n\nNo one wanted to show me their list of rules, so I had to wait until one of my classmates died.\n\nIt took nearly a week. \n\nI was working at 3:00 a. m. because I had only been on the clock for ten hours. I was rushing into another room so that a patient wouldn\u2019t know I was Googling his symptoms (doctors do this FAR more than you realize) when I saw Myron by himself in an O. R. \n\nI stopped immediately. \u201cMyron?\u201d I squeaked. \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d \n\nHis arms were working furiously, but his back was turned toward me, so I couldn\u2019t see what he was doing.\n\nSomething felt wrong. \n\nMyron was the pick of our litter. He\u2019d been top ten in his class at John Hopkins, and he would remind us of that fact in exchange for answering the questions that we were too terrified to ask Dr. Scritt.\n\nSlowly, I approached Myron, not wanted to startle him. \u201cWe\u2019re really busy right now, is there something you need help with?\u201d\n\nHe showed no outward signs that he had heard me. Instead, he kept pumping away furiously at the task at hand. \n\nWhen I was five steps from him, I could see drops of blood flying over his shoulder. \n\nWhich made no sense, since he had been alone in the room.\n\n\u201cMyron?\u201d I whispered, barely loudly enough to hear my own words.\n\nI slowly crept around his left side, finally bringing the scene into full view.\n\nMyron\u2019s abdomen was split from sternum to pelvis. His esophagus spilled out, and his stomach sat on the table. A nest of quivering small intestine led from the bottom of his stomach back into his shredded torso. \n\nMyron showed no outward signs of pain.\n\nHe was too busy working.\n\nHe clutched his own stomach tightly in his left hand, the folds squirting through his fingers like unbaked bread. His right hand was working furiously with a scalpel, sawing his organ into ribbons. Rivers of sweat poured down his forehead with the intensity of the effort.\n\nI tried to scream, but it only came out as a moan.\n\nThat was enough to get Myron to notice me.\n\nSlowly, he raised his head. Slowly, he smiled.\n\nIt was not a happy smile.\n\nWith eye contact locked on me, he licked his lips, angrily stabbed a piece of his stomach, and lifted it to his mouth.\n\nHe bit.\n\nHe chewed.\n\nThen he lunged.\n\nBut most people don\u2019t know how to move with their innards splayed out for all the world to see, and this was his downfall. Myron\u2019s tattered guts caught on the corner of the table, and he fell to the floor. \n\nFinally, he screamed. \n\nI had learned very early in my medical career that compartmentalization is indispensible. That instinct took over my brain in the moment, and I acted clinically.\n\nMyron was still grasping his scalpel with his right hand. I kicked it \u2013 hard \u2013 and it flew out of his hands.\n\nHe stared at me and screeched.\n\nWith his entrails still wrapped around the table, I figured my best option was retreat. I moved to the back of the room as a doctor and a janitor burst in. \n\nAnd in possibly the most shocking moment of the night, I realized that they were *not* shocked. \n\nMyron was anesthetized, subdued, and extracted within a minute of their arrival. \n\nFor a moment, I was alone with a pool of blood and diced stomach lining. \n\nAnd something else.\n\nA sheet of paper lay on the floor, its corner just touching the edge of the creeping blood. \n\nMyron had dropped his list of rules. \n\nThe practical part of my brain continued to drive me. I snatched the paper from the ground, then quickly exited the room, taking care to avoid the puddle.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to leave any bloody footprints in my wake. \n\nI knew that I had to read the list as soon as I was able to find thirty uninterrupted seconds to myself. Three hours later, I had my opportunity and ducked into a janitor\u2019s closet. With a shaking, *exhausted* hand, I pulled the chain on a bare bulb, tried to ignore the noxious smell of leaking ammonia, and read.\n\n-------------\n\n**St. Francis Hospital Rules \u2013 Guidelines for new doctors**\n\n1 \u2013 Never, under any circumstances, share your copy of the rules with anyone else.\n\n2 \u2013 If any other doctor displays erratic behavior, leave the area immediately. Do not make eye contact.\n\n3 \u2013 If any other doctor is approached or detained by someone in a janitor\u2019s uniform, do not interfere. Never ask about that former doctor again. \n\n4 \u2013 Never touch any seemingly abandoned Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups. Those are Dr. Scritt\u2019s favorite candy.\n\n5 \u2013 Any child that dies in St. Francis hospital MUST be cremated within 120 minutes of official time of death. If you suspect this rule has been broken, alert Dr. Scritt, and the hospital will be evacuated. \n\n6 \u2013 There is no Children\u2019s Burn Unit at St. Francis hospital. If you find yourself there, continue walking until you return to familiar territory. This usually requires traveling in a straight line down the central hallway for 47 minutes. You will not reach a wall during that interval.\n\n7 \u2013 This rule is on a need-to-know basis.\n\n8 \u2013 A small quantity of sulfuric acid is kept in every room. This is ONLY intended for use on patients with severed spinal cords. If they attack, a hypodermic injection of H2SO4 into the cranium is the only way to subdue the subject. \n\n9 \u2013 The morgue must house at least 13 cadavers at all times.\n\n10 \u2013 If find yourself on the hospital roof with no memory of how you got there, you have only two choices. Either wait for an extraction team to find you, or jump four stories to the sidewalk on Court Street.\n\n11 \u2013 If you see Room 1913, do not look directly at the numbers. Do not open the door. This is, by far, the most important rule.\n\n---------------\n\nMy heart stopped when the door opened.\n\nDr. Scritt was staring at me. What little emotion shined through her exterior seemed to be surprise.\n\nWe both stood, frozen, for five seconds of agonized silence. \n\n\u201cDr. Afelis,\u201d she drawled gravely, \u201cI\u2019m shocked.\u201d She stared down at the bloodstained list of rules in my hand.\n\nI reached for words. *Any* words, because literally any response would make me look less guilty than I did in that moment, staring up at my boss\u2019s boss\u2019s boss and saying literally nothing in my defense as she weighed my soul with her eyes.\n\nAnd I said nothing. \n\n\u201cYou took a list that wasn\u2019t yours, and were nowhere to be found after your coworker experienced such an *unnatural* incident.\u201d Dr. Scritt huffed through her nose. \u201cIt seems that *you\u2019re* willing to do the unthinkable in the name of getting what you need. And *Myron* couldn\u2019t\u2019 even follow the most important rule.\u201d She clenched her teeth. \u201cI had a four-year streak of predicting which incoming doctors will break the soonest. This will *ruin* my chances in the office pool.\u201d\n\nThe ghost of a smile graced her lips before she turned to leave. \n\n\u201cGet to work, doctor. You\u2019ve got three hours left on your shift, and those symptoms aren\u2019t going to Google themselves.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t realize that I\u2019d been holding my breath until I heard my own gasp for air.\n\nShaking, I slowly emerged from the janitor\u2019s closet. I quickly stuffed the list of rules back into my pocket, reflecting on the fact that I had just achieved what *might* be considered an actual win.\n\nPerhaps, just maybe, I would keep my head above water at St. Francis after all. \n\nI turned to head down the hall when I stopped in my tracks. \n\nEverything was unfamiliar. What the hell had happened?\n\nI glanced all around. The design of the hallway was familiar, but everything was *off.* I could hear people talking in the rooms, but the immediate vicinity was devoid of all people but myself.\n\nNothing made sense.\n\nThen I looked up.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll be honest, I peed just a little when I read the sign.\n\n*ST.

Well, there's enough burn stacks in the area that the off-schd crematorium won't be noticed by most.    \n\n\nAs someone born nearby (I was born in Huntington) I can tell you that some strangenesses will be scoffed at, but others will be met with an understanding by the locals.  Learn to tell the difference between someone imparting actual knowledge and someone teasing a newbie to the area - it can be a lifesaver.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few suggestions - \\*Never go looking for a Hell Gate.  There are supposed to be Nine of them in the area.  There are dozens of potential sites.  *Treat them all as real, but try not to talk about it.*  \\*If walking at night on a New Moon, try not to cross too much of open space without company.  The Mothman territory line fluctuates naturally with migration, so you're never quite sure if you are safe, or not, but *they* seem to like the darkness of new moons.  \\*If someone shows up at your hospital saying the mine collapsed, and they look like their clothing is antiquated, be careful to treat them with extra care - sometimes soft spots can form in the temporal skin and you can get people wandering in from farther afield in history than normal.  It's very, very important that you not turn on the TV when they are near, or show them a newspaper.  Cell phones are fine *as long as you don't try and show them the screen.*  \\*Carry extra Reeses - they are everyone's favorite candy... and maybe a kitkat, because I like them.  :P  \\*Don't date someone who's been there for more than a hundred years if their family hates you.  It's *possible* to survive, but... let's just say that if the Hills don't like you, they *really don't want* you to marry one of their sons/daughters/children.  If the Hills don't like you, it can be... tragic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnjoy the view, get out of Charleston some and enjoy the touristy stuff, and -oh!  One more thing.

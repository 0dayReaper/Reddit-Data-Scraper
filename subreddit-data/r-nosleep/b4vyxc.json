    "postText": "The poster read, \u201cHappiness! Sold in Glass Jars! Call Today!\u201d and underneath the text was a phone number.\n\nI was walking home from a long, exhausting day of work when I caught a glimpse of the paper stapled on an old telephone pole. I took a picture of it thinking it was amusing.\n\nI was going to show my wife once I got to our apartment, but I was caught up with chores and forgot about it\u2014dinner, dishes, laundry, packing a snack for our daughter, putting her to bed, then putting her toys away that she\u2019d left out in the living room\u2014every night, it was the exact same routine.\n\nThe next day, I awoke sleeping back-to-back with my wife. I always had to get up earlier than she did for my job, so I quietly got ready for the day and headed out the door.\n\nAt work, I was updating the company\u2019s latest expense report. Most days were similar to this one. They were basically paying me to stare at a computer for nine hours a day and input a couple numbers in to a spreadsheet. I finished my work very quickly, so I decided to head out of the office early\u2014it also helped that it was a Friday, and a lot of people leave early at the end of the week.\n\nOn my walk back, I was thinking of what my life had become. I did this often. I always dreamed of traveling when I was younger. I wanted to drive across the country or solo-backpack across Europe. Then I met Kelsey. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I loved Kelsey. I mean, I still do. We just don\u2019t have that spark anymore. When you meet someone and get in a relationship, whether it\u2019s *meant to be* or not, some of your personal life-plans have to be put on hold. And then that relationship turns to marriage, and then you have a baby, then you have to enroll your daughter in a preschool, then you have to get a better paying job and work more hours and blah, blah, blah.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to throw a pity party for myself. I\u2019m just saying I wasn\u2019t exactly content with where I was in my life. I wouldn\u2019t have referred to myself as a happy person.\n\nAs I took the same route home that I did every day to work and back, I walked by the same poster I had passed the day before. I don\u2019t know why, I really don\u2019t, but I decided to call the number. I figured it would be some joke. Maybe someone just picks up and says, \u201cI love you!\u201d on the other end and hangs up. Or maybe it\u2019s a line to a sex-worker. I had no idea what to expect.\n\nI called. It only rang once before someone picked up.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d a woman said. \n\n\u201cUh, hi\u2014um, I\u2019m calling about your poster? Your ad?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, awesome,\u201d she said calmly, \u201cwhen do you wanna pick it up?\u201d\n\n\u201cPick what up?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe jar\u2026\u201d she said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.\n\n\u201cOh, of course, um,\u201d I realized then that I had left work early without telling Kelsey, so I could just go pick it up now and she\u2019d be none the wiser, \u201cwhat exactly is it? That your selling?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just told you. It\u2019s happiness. In a glass jar. Like the poster said. Happiness keeps best in glass jars. They\u2019re more durable than, say, a plastic bag.\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, okay. Should we meet somewhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor sure. I don\u2019t want you to end up being a creep or something, so let\u2019s go to a public place.\u201d\n\nThe public place we decided on was a Starbucks parking lot a little over a mile from me.\n\nNow, I didn\u2019t think I was really going to be buying a *jar of happiness* or whatever. I was 99% sure she was going to sell me drugs. Maybe heroine would be in the jar. I remember thinking, *Oh no, \u2018happiness\u2019 is probably a nickname for some street drug and I\u2019m going to a drug deal. What if she\u2019s a cop? Am I going to be arrested?* But something inside me told me to keep walking, and so I did.\n\nI stood outside and texted her.\n\nMe: **I\u2019m here.**\n\nHer: **Cool. Be there in a sec.**\n\nMe: **What are you driving?**\n\nHer: **Silver Camry.**\n\nAnd as her final text came through, I saw her car pull in. She took a spot not too far from where I stood. I could see there was no one else in the car, which put my kidnapping fear to rest. She opened her door and stood on the pavement, looking around until her eyes met mine. I gave her a little nod of acknowledgment. She simply responded by waving her hand, gesturing for me to come over to her car, so I did.\n\nShe was young, maybe mid-twenties, with curly, golden hair. Her skin was pale and contrasted with the all-black outfit she was wearing. I thought she looked like Glinda the Good Witch from *The Wizard of Oz* had put on the Wicked Witch\u2019s clothes.\n\n\u201cNice day out,\u201d she said as a greeting.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah it is. Hadn\u2019t really paid attention to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou *were* the one that called about the jar, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that was me.\u201d\n\n\u201cCool, well, here you go.\u201d\n\nShe handed me a very small, glass mason-jar. It couldn\u2019t have been more than two inches tall. Inside of it was a light. Not a light bulb\u2014just light. It was like someone bottled up sunshine. It glowed even in the midafternoon daylight. It looked like a tiny sun, or a tiny universe existing in this little crystal-walled home. I was admiring it with no attempt to hide the awe on my face.\n\n\u201cPretty rad isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2014what is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve asked that, like, three different times, I think. My answer is still the same. It is happiness. Happiness in a glass jar.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I do with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep it,\u201d She said simply, \u201cif you have any problems shoot me a text.\u201d\n\nShe started to get into her car.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d I said, \u201cI thought you were selling this? How much is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, man,\u201d she said with a smile, \u201cyou\u2019ll pay.\u201d\n\nShe closed her door and I stepped out of her way as she backed up, then drove off. What the hell had just happened? What was I holding? I looked down at the jar again, its radiance was simply mesmerizing. I put it in my pocket and could see its glow slightly through my pants. I began to walk home.\n\nWhat was just a nice, sunny day, quickly changed into a rainy one with clouds wrapping the sky. It was not forecasted that it would rain, or else I would\u2019ve ridden the bus or subway to work that day. I jogged home trying not to get too drenched. I finally found shelter once I made it to my apartment building.\n\nI walked up to my door and found that my key wasn\u2019t on my key ring anymore. *Shit, I can\u2019t believe I lost it again,* I thought.\n\nI knocked on the door and said in a somewhat loud voice, \u201cHey babe it\u2019s me, I don\u2019t know what happened to my key.\u201d I heard the door being unlocked from the other side.\n\nWhen the door opened, I was greeted by a large, heavy-set man with greasy hair and unkempt goatee, he said, \u201cI think you got the wrong door, bud.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d I said, disoriented, \u201cmy bad, sorry, have a good one.\u201d\n\nHe let out a chuckle as he closed the door. \n\nApartment number 33.\n\nI know that was my apartment. I know it was. I\u2019d been in apartment 33 for five years now. But *that* was not my apartment. From what I could see inside, all the furniture was different, it was painted a different color, it was all wrong. I felt like I\u2019d hit my head and was drugged. In that moment, nothing made sense.\n\nI pulled out my phone to call Kelsey so she could calm me down and tell me I just got confused for a second. But her contact wasn\u2019t in my phone. In fact, nothing was in my phone. I had no messages with her. No previous calls. No pictures. It was like my phone reset to its factory settings. Did that girl somehow switch my phone out when I wasn\u2019t looking? I would\u2019ve just dialed Kelsey's number manually, but I couldn\u2019t quite remember it. I had known it by heart before, but not anymore. I needed to get back to the office, I had all my contacts backed up on my work computer.\n\nSince it was still raining, I hopped on the bus which had a stop right in front of the apartment complex. I rode downtown toward my office, the whole time staring at my wet shoes, wondering what the hell was going on.\n\nWe have a keycard access to our building so only authorized personnel can get inside. I always keep my access card in my wallet, always. But, surprise, surprise\u2014it wasn\u2019t there. I buzzed in to the speaker we had for guests with appointments, or employees as a back-up in case anyone lost or forgot their card. \n\n**BZZZ** \n\n\u201cHey this is Tim, I must\u2019ve lost my card. My employee number is\u2026\u201d I stopped as I drew a blank.\n\nA voice came through the Speaker, \u201cTim? You got cut out, what\u2019s your employee number?\"\n\n\u201cUm, I can\u2019t remember, I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, just tell me your full name and department.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, finance. I\u2019m in finance. My full name is Tim Brooks.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne sec.\u201d\n\nAbout thirty seconds later, the man spoke to me again.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a Tim Brooks working in this building. Did you have an appointment with someone?\u201d\n\nI backed up in surprise, almost tripping on my own feet. I had just been in that office an hour or two ago. What was happening to me? I felt like I was getting Alzheimer\u2019s but going through every stage in one day. I stared at my hands, unsure if I was in the right body. I felt like the world around me was disintegrating. I wasn\u2019t in control, I was merely sitting inside somebody else\u2019s head, watching the world through their eyes.\n\nJust then, I got a text. I recognized the number immediately, it was that girl. The one who gave me the jar. I had forgotten all about it until I saw her text.\n\nHer: **Hey. How\u2019s it going?**\n\nI looked at my phone, dumbfounded. It made me angry she was so nonchalant about this. *She* knew what was going on. *She* had done this somehow.\n\nMe: **What the hell did you do to me?!**\n\nHer: **The worst is yet to come.**\n\nI was astronomically close to just chucking my phone as far as I could in frustration. I took the jar out of my pocket. It looked unchanged, still glowing just as bright.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck did you do!\u201d I yelled at the jar, realizing I probably looked like a lunatic.\n\nAs I stared at its glistening glass, I realized something. I didn\u2019t know what my wife\u2019s face looked like anymore. I knew her name. Well, I know it started with a K, or maybe a C. I couldn\u2019t picture her in my mind. I knew I had a wife. I knew I did. Yes, because I had a daughter. I had a wife and a daughter. I just, couldn\u2019t remember their faces then\u2014or their names, or their birthdays, or any memories I had with them.\n\nI know they existed. They did exist. I had just seen them that morning, right? I couldn\u2019t remember how she looked, or what she smelled like. What was our first date? We had a wedding, right? What about our first kiss? Or my daughter\u2014or was it my son? Maybe I didn\u2019t even have a kid. But my wife, or girlfriend, she was real. I knew she was. The thought was tearing me apart. I couldn\u2019t see her in my head. I couldn\u2019t recall a single fact about her.\n\nI was standing outside of the same building, but I was unsure why I was. Did I work there? I must work somewhere. The rain was accompanied by a chilly wind now. It was whipping at my face, making my nose and cheeks sting. I wanted to go home. I wanted to be with her. I wanted to be warm. I wanted to go in to a shitty office job that kept a roof over my head. I wanted it all. I was soaking wet. I was miserable. I couldn\u2019t remember my parents, or my childhood. Did I even have any friends? Why was I in the rain?\n\nI looked down at my hand. I was still clutching the jar. The only memory of my entire life I could concretely remember was that girl giving it to me. Telling me it was happiness. It did not bring happiness. It brought pain. It bought suffering. I was more miserable in that moment than I\u2019d ever been.\n\nMy phone buzzed:\n\n**Break the jar, Tim.**\n\nI looked at my other hand. With the setting sun and the rainy sky, I swear the jar glowed brighter than any street light near me. I didn\u2019t break it because I was following her instruction. I broke it because I was angry. I broke it because I was upset. I needed a release. I raised my arm above my head, and brought it down with one swift motion, shattering the jar on the concrete beneath my feet.\n\nThat dark, chilly air accompanying the rain spread away like it was the shockwave of a bomb going off, and I was at the epicenter. I saw the warm, yellow light from inside the jar spread rapidly across the ground and ascend into the sky. It was as if I was watching the beginnings of the universe being created\u2014like God had just snapped his fingers and said, \u201clet there be light.\u201d I was engulfed in it. I could no longer see street or rain, or anything dark. I felt like I was plummeting into a star going faster than the speed of light. It felt like sitting in front of a fire on a cold winter\u2019s night, but that warmth was covering every inch by body.\n\nAnd then I blinked.\n\nImmediately I could feel the sheets beneath me, and my back barely touching my wife\u2019s. I was staring out the window. The morning light drenched through the glass and gleamed on my face.\n\nI stood from bed and grabbed my phone. It was Friday morning. I had one text:\n\n**Let me know if you ever need another jar :)**\n\nI called in sick to work. I snuck into my daughter\u2019s room and greeted her with a kiss and told her she didn\u2019t have to go to preschool today. We were going to have a family day. She smiled and stretched out her arms with a yawn before curling up and falling back asleep. \n\nI got back in bed and squeezed my wife tightly. I didn\u2019t let go for hours. Our daughter came into our room and woke us up eventually\u2014she was jumping on the bed and shouting for us to wake up. Yesterday I may have found that annoying. Yesterday I may have found a lot of things annoying, or monotonous, or dull.\n\nBut not today. Today, I pulled her under the covers in between me and Kelsey.\n\nToday was going to be a good day. Today, I was happy.",

The support I get from the people who work there has been really encouraging, I got away from my abusive ex with help of the clinic. They gave me treatment for my hep c and I'm clean from that now too! And they've helped and supported me to get my daughter back in to my life \ud83d\udc95\n\n I've had slip ups, with cannabis, cannabis is my Akilles heal..they see it as a relapse if I'm positive one time on thc and it irritates me, I don't drink, I don't do any hard drugs, except my legal, courtesy of the government, methadone and lyrica, which are so much worse than cannabis. I wish my country could be more open minded and also, to speak their language, money, they would make so much money on making a legit business of cannabis. \nIf I'm positive on thc on one urin test I loose my daughter. And I don't hang out with druggies or live a \"bad\" lifestyle I have one really good friend that's totally sober, we hang out with his kids a lot or when they're at their mothers we watch series in bed with my dog and my cat. I never party, I love to be a mom and do mom stuff, but when I can't smoke a blunt in my own home, when my daughter's at her dads, that's ridiculous..I'm 31 for fuck sake.",

Every weekend another town another zoo/swimming pool/museum. We got back together after 7 monts and now we have a second daugther and have been together for 11 years.\n\nThat split was our 'glass jar'.\n\nI have an amazing girlfriend, a great job, a mancave and 2 beautifull daughters.

And in society we become the roles we play - being a \u201cgood\u201d husband and dad while only being happy because your fulfilling a role - not because your happy with your inner self. I think the jar is a chance to detach from reality to make sure you actually enjoy your current life - and then you can go back like nothing happened. Almost like meditation.

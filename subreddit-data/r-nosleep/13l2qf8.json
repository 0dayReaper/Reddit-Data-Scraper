    "postText": "__________\n\nThe remainder of that [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13k3gxw/im_trapped_in_a_basement_elevator_alongside/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=15) day was about as normal as you could get given the terrifying circumstances. \n\nPhil, Sidney and Chlo\u00e9 spent most of the day getting the door open all the way and trying to see if they could look at the cracks on either side of the elevator. There was enough room actually for us to\u2026 well, Phil said that it would give us a chance to piss and shit and he chose to go first. We actually took turns. I can\u2019t believe I held that in for that long. It was strange and disgusting and everyone turned and looked the other way when someone else went. We are still trying to be a little civil toward each other.\n\n I mentally wonder how long that will last given that people are disappearing one by one. \n\n\n During this time I also finally got the name of the soldier, according to Amanda his name is Nick and she is certain that he is dangerous. I can\u2019t help but to agree given what I know I saw in his backpack.  \n\nI have tried my best to communicate with her more through shorthand notes to figure out what she means precisely, but it hasn\u2019t been easy. I feel as though the others mostly ignore her because of her disability so I am using that to my advantage to learn some basic ASL. So far she seems to be the only one I can trust. \n\nWe have a closeness because of the girl that has disappeared. \n\nThe others in the elevator still seem to have no recollection of her so it has made me wary of them. \nAre they all pretending? Is there something else going on here? So much remains unknown. \n\nSleep feels almost impossible given I don\u2019t think I can trust any of them. \n\nAnd I have had to conserve my battery more now than ever. The occasional internet signal that we get from above has become less frequent and my cell phone is sitting at 63%. I have been careful to limit my activity to just taking notes and then posting an update when there is signal. Calling out or any other casual browsing of my phone is a waste of time. All that matters is making sure I keep a record of this strange dreadful situation. \n\nIt feels so easy that I could disappear alongside the girl next. \n\nAbout six hours later, when all of us were beginning to wonder just what we would do for food, there was a strange noise from above. \n\nI stood up and listened intently, gesturing for Amanda to get to her feet as the others groggily woke. Then the lights in the elevator flickered on and off slowly, as though the power was finally coming on. \n\nAll of us were up on our feet when the next unexpected miracle seemed to happen. The elevator shook and we felt it begin to rise. \n\nPhil shouted excitedly. \u201cSee? I told you we were going to get out of here.\u201d \n\nAmanda instinctively reached for me and squeezed my hand, her eyes panicked. Something told me our escape was not going to be so easy, but I kept the paranoia to myself for the moment as the elevator slowly lifted us up. \n\nSoft hissing came from the still open door as Sidney and Chlo\u00e9 moved out of the way, the nurse pressing the elevator button for the 1st floor. Then I spotted what looked like long oozing slime dripping from the open wall that was rushing by. Some of it got into the elevator. Amanda pressed herself up against the wall, almost trying to claw her way up to avoid it. I followed her lead and kept away as the slime touched Sidney\u2019s foot and she screamed out in agony. \n\n\u201cHoly shit!!\u201d she screamed as she stumbled backward. Phil and Chlo\u00e9 held her against the left wall as the slime ate a small hole into the elevator floor. It was burning faster than acid. \n\nThe elevator made a lurch and suddenly came to a stop as the chemical slime finished eating a hole near the right half of the door, reducing what little space we had in this claustrophobic hell even more. \n\n\u201cNo, no, no no. Dear god please keep going,\u201d Phil said as he tried to reach across the elevator to press a button. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 told him as she struggled to keep away from the slime. \n\nBut he didn\u2019t listen, stretching his arm as far as he could in a desperate attempt to press the button. All of us saw what was happening and I even tried to pull Phil back before he went too far. But then the elevator made the decision for all of us. It buckled and he fell forward, his hands instinctively pressed outward to lessen the impact but instead being immediately hit with the toxic sludge. He screamed bloody murder as all of us scrambled to help and try to get him out of the burning goop. \n\nEveryone except Nick and Chlo\u00e9 as they cautiously avoided getting anywhere near the sludge. The more we tried to help Phil, the more horrid scars were being wrecked on his body. The slime was burning quickly.\n\n\u201cHelp us or he dies!!!\u201d I screamed to Nick. Whatever this strange material was, it was destroying his skin and going even deeper into his arm. A minute longer and it would be eating muscle and tissue. \n\nSomething moved Amanda to decide to break from her paralyzed fear and try to help, all of us used our combined weight to turn Phil over as we pushed him to the left wall of the elevator. The slime was gone but the damage it has done is obvious.  \n\nSidney and Chlo\u00e9 took off his shirt to check the skin and tissue around his lungs where some of it splattered and Phil continued to struggle to breathe. Most of the burns are near his right. arm and hand and chest. \n\nI saw Amanda signing something to Nick and he seemed agitated. She pointed toward his bag. Perhaps asking if he has any supplies to help. \n\n\u201cWe warned him not to! It\u2019s his own damn fault. We are lucky that stuff didn't touch us,\u201d he said as he looked toward the black smoldering acid that was still eating through the elevator floor. \n\nNick became stoic as he looked at the maintenance man and listened to him scream, then stepped over him. \n\n\u201cEveryone move over there as much as you can,\u201d he instructed. \n\nWe complied begrudgingly as he tossed his bag down aside Phil and unzipped it, taking out a few food supplies. I had recalled seeing some of these survival items in the bag the day before but hadn\u2019t understood what they were for. \n\nThen he pulled out what looked like a suitcase from a secret compartment of the bag. I hadn\u2019t searched hard enough earlier, I realized. He took out the small briefcase and then the gun, setting them alongside Phil. \n\n\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d Sidney asked, her eyes widening in fear. \n\n\n\u201cHoly shit, Eli was right. You are a nut job,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 realized. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to offer him except this.\u201d\n\n\u201cHold on; we can\u2019t do this. The elevator is still rising maybe we can get him to the hospital I work at. It\u2019s just around the corner,\u201d Sidney said. \n\nPhil is grumbling and his eyes are filled with tears as he looks at Nick. I can\u2019t tell if he is consenting or not. \n\n\u201cPlease\u2026 everyone look the other way,\u201d Nick ordered. I fumble with words, too paralyzed with fear in that moment to see this unfolding before my eyes. \n\nHe cocks the gun and points it at Phil\u2019s head as the women scream but before he can pull the trigger, more chaos is unleashed. \nThe elevator buckles again. And the strange low gurgling noise we had heard the first night returns. \n\n\u201cOh god, it\u2019s that thing,\u201d I whispered. \n\nThe others remained still as the noise got closer and the elevator started to shake. \n\nThen Chlo\u00e9 turned toward the door and shouted, \u201cClose it! Close it now before it gets to us!!\u201d \n\nNick pushed me out of the way, ignoring the last bit of the burning ooze as he struggled to try and get the metal grating closed. \n\nI thought of how hard it was for Sidney, Phil and Chlo\u00e9 to get it open with their combined strength and saw the dread in Amanda\u2019s eyes as the sound came from right below us. She could feel the entire elevator shaking but wasn\u2019t sure what to do or where to hide. \n\n\u201cHelp me! Damn it!!\u201d Nick insisted. \n\nI moved to the left side of the door, trying my best to help. Then I felt someone yank me back.\n\nAmanda held me there as we both watched what looked like shimmering scales of a massive creature move between the gap of the door and the wall. \n\nThe scales began to open, revealing strange sinew and odd patterns of scales and teeth as the bellows got louder. \n\nI saw at least a couple dozen rows of sharp needled fangs as the maw of this ungodly beast opened and I grabbed Nick to pull him back. His arm was against the monster's maw and I heard bones snap as it was crushed by its weight and he screamed in agony. \n\nThe lights flickered overhead again and  the elevator buckled again.\n\nThen we all felt it plummet. \n\nThis time I remembered every sensation of the fall. My body levitated from the floor of the elevator for just the briefest of moments as we were hurtled downward. The women screamed, even Amanda. It felt like we were falling forever. Darkness overtook the elevator again and then at last, we slammed down hard onto the basement floor. It felt like I had broken a few bones as well. My head was throbbing and I was crying. \n\nI could hardly move for the longest time as I listened to the sounds of the others' pain. We were in mental agony as well from everything that happened. I just wanted to die as I rubbed my body and looked around the blurry elevator. \n\nWhen I did open my eyes slowly, what I saw next was another spectacle of horror. \n\nAmanda was against the door, looking scared but unable to move. Pinned there by the jaws of the beast that had managed to pry the door open. She had somehow managed to get Nick away but in the process the monster had latched onto her. \n\n I couldn\u2019t even move my body to reach out to her. It felt like I was being weighed down by bricks. \n\nIt pulled her into its mouth and she screamed as much as she could. But there was nothing we could do. The others weren\u2019t even conscious. \n\n\nIt grabbed at her and pulled her all the way into its frightening thin mouth. \nIt happened so fast I couldn\u2019t even scream as she was swallowed up. \nThe monster slithered away and In her place the elevator door closed leaving behind a pool of blood.\n\n[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13lzwug/im_trapped_in_a_basement_elevator_alongside/?)",

The \u201cHow much time is left\u201d note in Nick\u2019s bag was a note like the kind you\u2019ve been writing to her. Could she have written it? And she remembers the little girl from before, but isn\u2019t too freaked out by everyone else forgetting? Who knows what she signed to Nick about his supplies. Don\u2019t trust anyone!!\n\nGlad Phil is alive for now. Edge of my seat",

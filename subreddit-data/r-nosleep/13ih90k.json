I need it to extract you from the simulation.\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13e0ut5/when_i_was_seventeen_my_drama_teacher_took/)\n\nThe voice didn\u2019t sound like Allison, my treatment nurse plugged into the program with me. It was more of a disembodied murmur like she was trying to hide her real one. This time the voice speaking into my skull didn\u2019t sound mechanical, or at least not what I was used to. Instead, it carried the real world which was slowly bleeding into me breath by breath splintering through the simulation, with it. \n\nI sensed my body. I was\u2026 stiff. \n\nAnd with that feeling starting to blossom back into my physical self, I felt it; the metallic thing plugged directly into the back of my mind and spine, a snake-like device burrowing into the meat of my brain. However advanced in technology this treatment was, the thing wasn\u2019t stable. I sensed old attempts to force this thing into me, cavernous holes in my head and old and new blood dripping in beads down my neck. It was so cold.\n\nI had already gotten a glimpse of it before, but this was more like being thrust inside icy waves of water, suspended in a vicious current.\n\nThe real world was numbing. Painful. \n\nSo painful, my body and mind was struggling to fully register it.\n\nI felt my own glacial fingers, and three pairs of frozen hands and wrists cruelly bound to mine. As I battled with these new sensations, more slammed into me; a frozen breeze whipping my hair across my face. I craved reality at that moment. \n\nInstead of drowning inside the memory of what I had done to my best friend, I needed clarity. I needed the real world, no matter how painful it was. I wanted it enough to try and attach myself to an anchor. To my own strangled breath caught in my throat and my icy fingers caught in rope cruelling binding me to a stranger. No. There was more than one stranger and we had been there a while judging from my loss of feeling\u2014 of all sensation in my arms, legs, torso. My body was close to freezing to death, and yet my mind was blissfully ignorant, still plugged into the program hiding me from this. Numbing me from the reality I wasn\u2019t supposed to see. But why? I thought dizzily. \n\nI expected a high-tech facility as part of my treatment. Instead, why was I freezing to death? \u201cKiera, did you not hear me?\u201d \n\nAllison, or the mechanical voice in my head, droned. \u201cPlease tell me the dismantling code.\u201d Again, her voice had adapted what could be compared to human emotion. Allison sounded impatient.\n\n4879.\n\nThe numbers in front of me were brighter than the memory. Like I was supposed to reach forwards and touch them.\n\nHer words confused me for a moment as I teetered on the edge of hysteria. Trapped in limbo between three different worlds.\n\nThe real world, which was slowly bleeding back into me, the crumbling simulation of a bus with faceless passengers growing progressively more erratic, and memory. Where I was seventeen years old with the members of my drama club, covered in my best friend, standing on my school stage in front of the horrified faces of our family after eating her. I blinked and rubbed my eyes, and the screaming masses being held back by cops blurred into an audience of smiling faces and comically wide eyes. They were clapping. I could even see my mother in the front row with the biggest and proudest smile on her face.\n\n\u201cKiera, you are seeing what you want to see.\u201d Allison hummed. \u201cLook again. I will remove the filter, though please refrain from attempting to pull yourself from this trauma instance.\u201d\n\nShe paused. \u201cYou should be able to see the dismantling code in front of you. But first\u2026 take everything in. We ask our patients to accept the cause of their trauma before removing the poisoned memory and healing them. In your case, trauma instance 26 is at the root. While it is not quite the cause of your debilitating mental state, it definitely played a part.\u201d  Following her instructions, I did look again, my vision blurring. This memory was five years ago and yet it still felt so fresh in my mind, as if it hadn\u2019t been buried deep, deep down in an attempt to fix and then heal and then contort it into a sugar-coated fantasy hidden behind a protective barrier. So real.\n\nIt felt so real. The air was thick and I was choking on it, the stink of rotting flesh suffocating my nose and throat. I could feel and taste pieces of her stuck between my teeth and under my tongue, gouged at the back of my throat and dripping from my lips and chin. \n\nShe was all over me, everywhere. Lily was underneath me, a vicious and yet beautiful shade of red seeping across the stage. \n\nAnd yet\u2026 and yet! \n\nThe smell of her was more an aroma in my poisoned mind. She smelled like roast chicken and pot pie smothered in gravy. When Allison told me to drink in the memory and fully come to terms with what I had done, I did. She told me to anchor myself to my senses. Smell. The rotting decomposing flesh carved into my fingernails and stuffing my mouth. Taste. \n\nLily. No matter how horrifying the sight was in front of me, my body was still working to swallow her, to digest her despite parts of her creeping back up my throat in a thick, sour paste. \u201cWhat can you feel, Kiera?\u201d \n\nWhen I was caught between two answers; the glacier-like breeze of the real world and the tough rope binding my hands, or the sickening memory slowly beginning to consume me, she reiterated that the memory was what she was talking about. I felt\u2026 Inside the memory, as the real world was pulled away once  the program realized it was seeping into me\u2014I turned my head to the left and saw Wylan; his face illuminated by blinding stage lights lighting up the stage. Clumps of his thick, dark brown hair sticking to his forehead and beads of sweat glistening on his neck. \n\nThe pair of raybans he had been wearing as his character in the play, Ben, were clenched in his left hand, while his right hand was nestled in mine. I felt his sticky and slimy fingers soaked in Lily entangled with me.  His mouth was a horror show of deep, dark red smearing his lips and chin as he smiled at a standing ovation only he could see. Eyes as blank as the night sky with zero traces of the teacher\u2019s pet I thought I knew. Something splintered. The lenses of the glasses. And looking at the boy, whose eyes were starting to flicker, his smile thinning as the euphoria suffocating the four of us began to wear off\u2014his self-awareness began to seep back into him. And the more it did, I heard the crunch of the glasses under the weight of fingers slowly curling into a fist. \n\nStill though, we bowed again and again, like bowing would hide the fact that we had just eaten Lily Farah. Alyssa. Her smile was far too wide. Noah, his body starting to slump, his writhing fingers starting to claw at his hair.\n\nI should have felt disgust. Because I was awake and aware of what I was doing. I attempted to wrench my hand from Wylan\u2019s, a sharp hiss escaping my lips. So many emotions slammed into me. Terror. Agony. Pain. But instead, my mouth was watering, my fingers caught in his grasp had a mind of their own. It was like drowning in an almost perfect darkness which I wanted to push away and yet also revel in. \n\nI was itching to rip into soft, warm flesh, and drink deep, gorge myself on gore splattering the state in front of us. When I did, when I dropped to my knees and scooped up Lily\u2019s rotting remains and stuffed them into my mouth, I recoiled from the memory. This time, I was forceful.  \n\nStop!\n\n\u201cAs you w-wish, Kiera.\u201d\n\nAllison\u2019s voice stumbled slightly, though I caught it; the crackle of static between each word spoken overhead.\n\nI blinked. Back on the bus. Back in my seat. But this time the windows were swallowed by intense blackness I couldn\u2019t see through. \n\nWhen I squinted, I sensed movement coming towards us. \u201cThey cannot hurt you, remember. What you are seeing are visual depictions of what you see yourself as. While they can come very close during your closing treatment as your memories are being healed, they are harmless.\u201d the intercom said. \u201cIf y-you would like to l-leave the simulation, which is recommended after completing your treatment, please say the dismantling code. It was a four digit number which should have appeared inside the memory.\u201d \n\nThis time I knew I wasn\u2019t imagining it. \n\nAllison\u2019s voice was different. \u201cThe dismantling code, or protocol 4598HGB is the health and safety barrier put in place to p-protect you from possible hijacks to the procedure. \n\nBut you no longer need to be protected!\u201d \n\nThe voice sounded almost happy. \u201cWe can get through this t-together. Would you like to go back to your physical body?\u201d \n\nThe program was sounding progressively more human and I wondered if it was part of the treatment. Maybe the AI had been given a more human-like voice to appear more sympathetic. Whatever it, or she was, I needed her. It was a relief to finally have someone who sounded like she cared after seeing the hellscape which was my seventeen year old self\u2019s memories. The program waited for a moment. \u201cCan you see the code, Kiera?\u201d\n\nI nodded shakily. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay it.\u201d The program said. \u201cWhen the p-procedure is completed, the patient must give their consent to return to their physical body with their healed memories attached. We have healed exactly 85 out of 89 trauma instances, which allows you limited time in your physical body. Congra-gratulations!\u201d Her voice jumped again. \u201cYou are at 95 percent! You have d-done so well, Kiera!\u201d\n\nBut\u2026 where am I? I asked.\n\n\u201cYou are inside the Fix Me program!\u201d\n\nI mean, where is my physical body?\n\nThere was a pause before she answered. \u201cKiera, we ask that you do not question authority. To ensure a safe and painless transition back to yourself, we require you admitting the code. Due to health and s-safety precautions put in place to protect you, only patients will see the dismantling code. Once again, to safely disengage you from the program, we need the code.\u201d\n\nHow did you fix me? \n\n\u201cYou did it yourself, Kiera!\u201d The program was quick to answer with lightning fast efficiency. \u201cWhen coming to terms with your actions and fully removing the protective barriers put in place, you h-healed yourself! We knew you c-could do it!\u201d\n\nAren\u2019t you called the \u201cFix Me\u201d program?\n\n\u201cKiera, the code,\u201d The program said. \u201cOnce we have it, we can begin the transition to a more stable mental state.\u201d\n\nAllison was never impatient.\n\nHowever, she was giving me a way out. And there was nothing more I wanted than to escape my own mind. The realisation was like a knife cutting through my spine. \n\nI killed her. I killed Lily. Not even that. \n\nI ate her. Something disgusting and monstrous had blossomed inside me and I had really done that to my best friend. The words of my own admittance felt wrong and twisted in my mouth; enough to elicit a screech clawing at my throat. That one singular thought caused the bus to rock sideways. The ceiling started to crumble though, windows around me shattering. \n\nI dropped to my knees and pressed my hands over my ears, my chest felt like it was being suffocated. I killed her. I could feel my physical lips speaking the words. Still so far out of reach, in  a world full of agony slicing through the back of my head and the numbing cold slowly sending me to sleep. I screamed, and something splattered the window. I didn\u2019t see it, but I could feel it seeping through the cracks and covering me, painting me in her. \n\n\u201cYou did kill her, Kiera.\u201d The program said. \u201cBut that is w-what the Fix Me program is for. We are able to take it all away.\u201d When I lifted my head, the bus was falling apart under my feet. \u201cTell us the code, and you will return to your body without these memories.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did kill her Kiera.\u201d The voice hummed. \u201cDo not worry. Input the code, and everything will be fine.\u201d\n\n \u201cYou can make it go away?\u201d\n\nFor a moment, as simulation and the real world collided, I sensed someone in front of my physical body. I felt warm breath grazing my cheeks, a startling relief from the ice cold. \u201cOf course I can, Kiera.\u201d The voice hummed. \u201cJust tell me the code.\u201d\n\nAs my thoughts began to calm down, the simulation began to piece itself back together in confusing, pixilated chunks I couldn\u2019t tear my gaze from. The bus ceiling came back together, seats popping out of existence still occupied with the same shadows, faceless passengers with no identity. When the sky outside suddenly turned blue, and the sun was shining in my eyes, I took my seat once again. 4879. The code was still in my head, and bracing myself against my seat, I opened my mouth.\n\n\u201cFour.\u201d\n\nAt the corner of my eye, I saw a bird swooping across the sky.\n\n\u201cEight.\u201d\n\nThe bird came closer, and I found myself leaning back.\n\n\u201cSeven.\u201d\n\nWhen it slammed into the windowpane, I didn\u2019t scream, even when the thing exploded on impact once again, coating the glass in thick, dripping red. Luckily, the program was soothing at the back of my mind, lulling my mind. \u201cThey are just straying thoughts,\u201d she said. \u201cAllow yourself to detach from your trauma, Kiera. Remember. You will not be able to remember this.\u201d\n\nRight, I thought, dizzily.\n\nThe thought of being blissfully ignorant of what I had done was too tempting.\n\nSelfish, but that insatiable need to forget what I had done and ultimately heal my mind was pleasure I didn\u2019t know existed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d\n\nThe voice\u2014 another human voice, cut into me like a knife and it was enough to pull me closer to reality\u2014 to freezing cold air making me shiver, my numb fingers entangled with cutting rope. But the voice wasn\u2019t from the real world, the ice cold turning my skin blue, or the hot breath in my face speaking in disembodied tongues I couldn\u2019t understand. Instead, it was closer. At first, I didn\u2019t recognise it. I was a blank slate, with limited memories from my seventeen year old self. I had no idea who I had been as an eighteen and then nineteen year old. Twenty, and twenty one. \n\nAll of those years of my life had been washed away, numbed, with lingering pieces straying. Like knowing I was used to being filled with drugs to numb my body and mind, counting ceiling tiles was one of my favourite pastimes, and white was my favorite color. \n\nBut the voice\u2026 I knew it. It may have sounded like a stranger at first, but I knew it from the memories forced onto me. I knew it from drama club, from the shadow sitting behind me; the boy who couldn\u2019t sit still and regularly interrupted our teacher to either tell a crude joke, or announce he needed a piss. \n\nNoah Emory. \n\nAnd when his name entered my mind, I caught movement in the corner of my eye. \n\nA shadow, one of the other passengers without a face\u2014 suddenly did have a face. \n\nNoah. His 17 year old self.\n\nLily still covered him, painting his lips and chin; his torn blue and gold jersey he was using as a costume for the play covered in her entrails, bedraggled brown curls hanging in otherwise amused eyes. While the guy still looked seventeen, the hollow look in his eyes showed his true age. The bus jolted sideways, and the boy flung out his arms to keep his balance before jumping into the seat opposite me.\n\nI couldn\u2019t look him in the eye when he looked like that. The boy was covered in scarlet, and his face as well as the state of him was an exact replica of that night. Like I was staring directly at a memory.  \u201cNoah Emory, please return to your seat,\u201d the voice which definitely wasn\u2019t Allison said. \n\nUnlike Allison, it sounded almost\u2026 pissed.\n\n\u201cInvading other passenger\u2019s consciousness is a direct offence of protocol 67TR. This offense can be punishable by what we call brain-rot. If you do not return to your seat and stop bothering the other passengers, I will be forced to pull you from the simulation.\u201d\n\nTo my surprise, Noah laughed. It was the same laugh I knew, or at least my old self did. His laugh was more of a splutter.  \u201cOooh, right! Damn, would I love to see ya try!\u201d He shot back at the intercom. From the look on his face, I figured he and the voice which was not Allison had been sparring for a while. Noah rolled his eyes, leaning back in his seat. I couldn\u2019t move. I could still see pieces of Lily between his teeth. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He frowned at himself and recoiled at the state of himself.\n\n \u201cOh, shit. Yeah. Hold on a sec.\u201d\n\nTo my surprise, his costume slowly morphed into a black short-sleeved tee and sweatpants. A soda appeared in his hand. Noah cracked it open, nodding at me. \u201cWant one?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nHe pulled his legs to his chest, resting his chin on his knees, seemingly getting comfy on his seat. Noah raised a brow.  The boy saluted me with the soda, a fresh can of Coke. \u201cI mean a drink, dude.  I\u2019ve got pretty much anything you can imagine.\u201d\n\nI shook my head. \u201cHow are you here? I\u2019m sorry, did I miss something? How are you able to make soda magically appear?\u201d\n\nNoah shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a simulation, we can do anything we want\u2026\u201d he paused before mockingly looking left and then right before leaning over and hissing, \u201cEverything except get off of this fucking bus. I\u2019d rather be on a beach, or maybe home.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re\u2026\u201d I twisted around to point at the other passengers.\n\nNoah\u2019s lips curved into the class-clown grin which tugged at memories buried deep. He leaned back in his seat with a sigh, and once again, even simulation Noah couldn\u2019t keep still, his knees bouncing against each other. \u201cUnplugged?\u201d He scoffed. \u201cWell, yeah, you guys are all stuck in the fuckin\u2019 Matrix, re-living whatever bullshit we did to get ourselves stuck in here, and me?\u201d \n\nHe sipped the soda and exhaled out a breath. \u201cI\u2019m just chilling, man. It\u2019s aight. It\u2019s actually pretty fun when R2D2 isn\u2019t putting me on a time-out,\u201d he nodded at the ceiling. \u201cYah, babe. I\u2019m talking 'bout you.\u201d \n\nHe held up the soda. \u201cWe coulda had something, you know! But noo, you spend all of your robot-time  making sure I have zero fucking fun and am boring myself to death.\u201d Before I could speak, Noah pulled a face. \u201cBeing ripped apart by hell-beasts is not fun though. If you do find a door, and it will take serious mental capacity to imagine one,\u201d he leaned forward with a grin. \u201cThey\u2019ll getcha, Key. And they\u2019re fast.\u201d\n\nI ignored his latter words for a moment.\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d I hissed out. \u201cHow are you\u2026 I mean\u2026\u201d My gaze flicked to the back of the bus where the remaining passengers lacking identities, more like faceless shadows, still sat. Unmoving. Noah followed my gaze and rolled his eyes. \u201cHow are you here?\u201d\n\nHis demeanour darkened, and I was all too aware of the boy\u2019s expression almost\u2026 glitching. From the boy I remembered, to a shadow with his face, and haunted eyes I couldn\u2019t fully take in. \u201cThe better question, Key,\u201d His lips twisted. Something in him seemed to change or revert. It was almost like the simulation was trying to show us the versions of ourselves we wanted to see, but it was struggling\u2014and in blink-and-you-will-miss-it moments, our real selves began to seep through the cracks in the program. \n\nHis eyes were a shade of black, almost blank, and I couldn\u2019t understand them. The lights dimmed overhead, and I glimpsed something starting to come through those slowly growing cracks splintering into holes inside the simulation; something dark and twisted coiled around his right elbow. Immediately, I knew what it was and where it had come from. \n\nIt was the exact same symbol Lily had carved into our desks in her desperation to tell our group that we were doomed. And there it was. \n\nAn intricately drawn tattoo painted, and then cut and carved into his flesh to make it permanent. Noah noticed me staring and folded his arms, making an attempt to hide the strange rune-like markings creeping up his upper arm, expanding over his shoulder. \u201cDude. It's rude to stare.\u201d Noah held my gaze, hiding obsidian markings, his hand creeping up his elbow.  I caught his fingernails digging deep, as if he wanted to claw it away. \u201cBut\u2026anyway\u2026\u201d Noah let out a breath sputtering into a laugh.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d He downed his soda. \u201cWhy would you ever want to go back?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the \u2018treatment\u2019 they put us through? You know, when they force us to live all of this dark shit we\u2026 we did\u2026\u201d Noah trailed off, stumbling over his words. I could see a certain vulnerability in him he was trying to hide. \n\nThe way his whole body was trembling, not just his knees, and now that I was paying full attention, his fingers tip-toeing up his arm and grasping hold of his flesh tainted obsidian. \n\n\u201cI completed it.\u201d He said. \u201cI was given a choice whether to return to my body, you know, my physicals self in the real world, or stay here.\u201d Noah patted his seat with a forced grin. \u201cAnd of course I decided to stay here.\u201d\n\nSomething slimy  squirmed its way down my spine. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen everything?\u201d I swallowed my gut creeping into the back of my mouth.\n\nHe rested his chin on his knees with a sigh. \u201cYup. Every single filthy fucking detail, Key.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t help it, the question swarming my mind. \u201cWhat did we do\u2026\u201d I swallowed. \u201cAfter, I mean. This thing\u2026 this program tells me I have multiple convictions.\u201d\n\nHe pulled a face. \"Yeah. We all do. It\u2019s called being seeeeeeriously fucked in the head. \u201d Noah prodded his temples with two fingers. \u201cThey shoulda killed us when they had the chance. In fact, I am waiting for my own personal frontal lobotomy.\u201d\n\n\"Because we...\" I shook my head, my hands trembling in my lap. \u201cBecause we\u2026 ate Lily?\u201d\n\nNoah looked up at me, and at first I thought he was going to laugh before his smile twisted into a look of pain, unbridled despair which once again began to show me snapshots of his present self. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, you idiot.  Because of what we did after.\u201d\n\nHis words sent pinpricks down my spine.\n\n\u201c\u2026 after?\u201d\n\n\u201cNoah Emory.\u201d The intercom crackled. \u201cPlease return to your seat immediately. If you continue to bother other passengers, we will be forced to pull you from the simulation and interpolate brain-rot. This will not be pleasant experience for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright!\u201d Noah groaned, jumping up. \u201cGive me a minute! Key and me? We go way back. So, let me talk to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a minute. Starting now.\u201d\n\n\u201c59.\u201d\n\n\u201c58\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever you do,\u201d he said in a low murmur. \u201cWhatever they show you\u2014- you can\u2019t give them the dismantling code.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen what we did,\u201d his voice shook. \u201cThe real world. The real us. I know you can sense it, Key. The cold? The ice cold which is slowly killing us? The breath in front of your face you think you know, and the promise that we\u2019ll be healed.\u201d His tone darkened, collapsing into a hiss. \u201cIf you know what is good for you,\u201d his grip tightened on my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ll leave curiosity alone and let us fucking rot in here.\u201d \n\nI tried to pull away, but he held on, and I could sense his fingernails suddenly caked with her, his breath stinking of her rotten flesh. \u201cTrust me, Kiera.\u201d He pointed to himself. \u201cWho we are right now inside here, is before it all went\u2026 you know\u2026 wrong. Seventeen years old with our whole lives ahead of us. Post- school play? Doing what we did to Lily, and everything after; all the shit that put us in here in the first place. Those parts of us don\u2019t  exist anymore.\u201d I could sense his emotion, agony he was trying to hide. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re safe here, Key. We can stay here.\u201d\n\nHe let out a sigh. \u201cBefore we\u2026 you know\u2026.ate our fucking classmate and engaged in acts which deeeeefinitely justify sending us to rot in fake paradise.\u201d\n\nI started to argue, because Noah was crazy\u2026 for wanting to stay in this prison where our memories were forced onto us.\n\nAs if sensing my protest, he pulled away, and this time I could see him without the blood. He looked so much younger, and I wanted that version of him to stay. Before he doused himself in Lily\u2019s blood, drowning in her. \u201cWhat would you rather do? Live in blissful ignorance in here, chilling inside the version of yourself which was never fucked up\u2014- or start to remember?\u201d\n\nThe air in front of us\u2026 glitched suddenly. \n\nThe bus twisted into our school stage\u2014- our parents screaming at us, being held back by police. And in the middle of the audience stood our drama teacher. Mrs Beck. Her smile wide splitting open her mouth. She was the only one clapping. Inside an auditorium filled with chaos and white noise, the crowd\u2019s cries bleeding into one singular string of white noise, the sight of her sitting calmly and clapping, sent shivers ripping through my real body. \n\nThe simulation darkened once more around us. Noah\u2019s face contorted into something monstrous, animalistic. Lily\u2019s blood was no longer just a meal. Now she was part of the intricate lines tainting his skin, like tribal tattoos. He opened his mouth, upper incisors sharpened. I blinked, and I could see those same rune-like markings. Not just his elbow.\n\nThey were carved all the way down his neck and arms. While half of his hair had been sheared off and painted in deep, dark red. Noah must have seen my expression. He inclined his head, but the boy\u2019s eyes were.. black. Drowned. Suffocated by a darkness I could and never would understand. \u201cKey?\u201d \n\nThere was something writhing under his skin, and once I was seeing it, I felt movement in my own gut.\n\nKicking.\n\nLike something was trying to\u2026 burst from me.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\nPain struck the back of my skull, and I could feel something\u2026 protruding into my neck and spine. It was sharp and cutting. Stuck. Driven into my flesh. With every splinter of the real Noah, came reality forcing itself into the forefront of my mind. Ice cold air mixing with warm breath in my face. \u201cNoah Emory.\u201d The voice said, which snapped me back to the simulation. The runes cutting into his flesh were gone. \n\nNoah looked like himself again. But I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that it would keep happening the more I looked at him, like the real world was becoming more and more clear no matter how forceful the program was. \u201cPlease return to your seat immediately.\u201d Noah didn\u2019t move, only rolling his eyes, his clownish smile returning.\n\n\u201cWait for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is your final warning.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going!\u201d \n\nWith an exaggerated groan, he made a deal of walking, or rather dragging himself backwards.\n\nWith two fingers, he saluted me. \u201cRemember what I said.\u201d Noah mimed cutting his throat. \u201cMr Emory, attempting to invade other passengers' consciousness as well as influencing their thoughts is a direct offence of protocol 67TR. Please return to your seat and resume self-reflection. We ask you this so we can maintain a safe environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah, whatever, R2D2.\u201d\n\nAnd just like he never existed, Noah, after stumbling over to the back of the bus, a snapshot of who I knew best\u2014 the class clown wearing the oversized football jersey-- joined the three motionless shadows, his identity bleeding into null nothing.\n\nI was alone again, choking on my own breath. Turning to the window, the sky was a darker blue. \u201cThis is normal, Kiera. Outside the window reflects your current mental state inside your memory. Would you like me to replace it? I can make it anything you would like. For example, the view of Mount Fuji on vacation in Japan. It is a precious memory and an image you hold close to your heart. If you would like, I can turn the view into something much suited to your taste. Would you like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well. Are you able to resume treatment? We apologise for the inconvenience.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes, of course. However, we do urge patients to engage in memories to quicken the healing process.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about earlier?\u201d I tried to focus on the other passengers to try and imagine faces, but there was nothing. Once again, Noah was back to being a null void existing at the back of the bus. \u201cYou seemed fine with letting me out. What changed?\u201d\n\nA pause. \u201cI apologise, Kiera. I do not understand your question. As your personal nurse, it is far too early to start the transition to your physical body. Ending the simulation halfway through treatment is extremely dangerous. Patients may never wake up or revert to their original state before treatment. Which would be severe. You are confused. Do you need more time to think?\u201d\n\nSomething cold slithered down my spine, but I pushed the thought away.\n\nI wasn\u2019t crazy, right?\n\nThe voice trying to get the dismantling code, and the one which had spoken to Noah, definitely wasn\u2019t Allison.\n\n\u201cAre you still Allison?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the Fix Me, program. Kiera, are you able to resume? I do not mean to rush you but patient\u2019s are required to either be undergoing treatment, or in self-reflection.\u201d\n\n \u201cSure. But first\u2026 where am I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are in the\u2014\"\n\n\u201cNo, right now. I know I\u2019m in the Fix Me Program. I mean my actual body.\u201d\n\n\u201cKiera, I am unable to give you that information.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease.\u201d I said. \u201cYou asked earlier if I wanted to know my convictions. Surely you can tell me how I got here, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am unable to calculate your current location. However, I can assure you, you are inside our state of the art facility. Due to The Kilbride Incident which devastated your entire town, you were brought here four months ago to undergo emergency treatment. In a private trial between government personal, the judge ruled that it was either you were put through the Fix Me program to revert you to a previous stable mental state before you underwent significant trauma or be given the death penalty. Many parties argued that the cause of your actions were influenced by a second party, and thus, your actions could be justified. After deliberation, the judge agreed, and you were sentenced here to undergo treatment which will fix you.\u201d Her words played on my mind. \n\nThe real world definitely didn\u2019t feel like a facility. It was\u2026 cold. I was somehow outside.\n\nFreezing to death.\n\n\u201cKiera, are you able to resume the treatment?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood! Now, I must warn you. Your memories where your mental state is significantly low will cause you distress. Unfortunately, I will be restricting the use of your arms to prevent self-inflicted injury. Do not worry, Kiera.\"\n\nI felt it automatically, the sensation of stars filling me. Numbing my body.\n\nMy head hit the window, and I closed my eyes.\n\n\u201cAs always Kiera, I will begin with a question: What did you do on the evening following opening night?\u201d\n\nI was back on stage, staring down at my hands slick with glistening scarlet. Snapping out of the trance we had held me, I sucked in a breath, my vision clarity. I turned to Wylan, and the boy\u2019s gaze found mine. I couldn\u2019t see the blood, the gore, all over him. I think Allison was blocking it out at that moment. He tugged his  hand from mine. The manic excitement in his eyes was flooded with a primal fear, an agony, which sent him stumbling away muttering gibberish to himself. \u201cNo.\u201d Wylan stared down at his bloody hands, and then his costume. \u201cNo, no, this\u2026. this isn\u2019t happening. This is a sick joke.\"\n\n\u201cMom.\u201d\n\nI managed to choke out, sputtering on beads of red dripping down my chin.\n\n\u201cMom!\u201d\n\nMy mom\u2026 she wasn\u2019t there. I searched for her face in the shadow, on my knees, spitting out pieces of Lily.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\nSomeone\u2019s hands grasped hold of mine and I was yanked backstage. Wylan. Who had gotten a hold of himself. \u201cHey. Hey, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re okay.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWe did a bad thing, and we need to get out of here.\u201d His eyes were blank. I couldn\u2019t see traces of the teacher\u2019s pet I thought I knew. I was sobbing, screaming, and his arms were around me, grasping me. \u201cWe\u2019ll\u2026 we\u2019ll go out of the back door,\u201d he whispered.\n\n\u201cOkay, Key?\u201d Wylan dragged me and the others into an awkward hustle, the four of us grasping each other. Like we were on the football field. \u201cListen to me very, very carefully,\u201d Wylan said through hysteric hisses. They\u2019re going to want answers we can\u2019t give them. We can\u2019t explain what we just.. what we just fucking did.  So, we need to run. I know her. At least\u2026 I had my suspicions\u2014 and if she is who I think she is, we need to get out of here right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d I managed to get out in a slur.\n\n\u201cAre you deaf?!\u201d He hissed. \u201cMrs Beck. I thinks she\u2019s a survivor. I saw her face on TV when I was a kid, and I\u2026 I think they wiped the fucking footage,\u201d he was gasping for breath, and this was the first time I\u2019d seen the teacher\u2019s pet lose his cool.\n\n\u201cThey\u2026 they wiped every trace of it. Every trace of it! Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!\u201d\n\n\u201cA survivor of what?!\u201d Alyssa shrieked.\n\nWylan swiped at his bloody chin, letting out a strangled breath. \u201cI\u2019ll explain when we\u2019re out of here!\u201d\n\nThe memory shuddered, and the four of us were half running, half stumbling towards the back exit. \u201cWhat the fuck. What the fuck? What the fucking fuck?!\u201d Noah was shrieking, his bloody arms around Alyssa. \u201cWhat did we do? Lily! Fucking Lily!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Wylan said in a whimper, urging us into a stumbled run.\n\n\u201cKey.\u201d He tugged me when I didn\u2019t move, when I was suddenly aware that every piece of me was coated with her.\n\n\u201cKey! Jesus fucking Christ, we don\u2019t have time for this!\u201d\n\nFootsteps came down the hall, and Wylan dragged us back.\n\n\u201cBack door.\u201d He said. \u201cNow!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy.\u201d\n\nI spluttered the word while he dragged me, and I felt like I was flying. \u201cWhy are we running? We need\u2026 the cops. We need the cops!\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause.\u201d Wylan spoke under his breath, his words hanging stagnant in the air when we came to an abrupt stop, where something was inching across the corridor, a shadow, a life-like shadow, bleeding across the walls. And standing, still clapping gleefully, was Mrs Beck.\n\nAround her, shadows sprouted from every corner, and we were surrounded, stumbling back. Wylan gripped my hand tighter and however slimy it was, tainted with Lily, it was still some kind of comfort. With the edge of my tongue, I dug a piece of her from my teeth, my mouth watering. My stomach felt sickeningly empty, and staring down my hands, I had a sudden insatiable need to lick Lily from my fingers. Just the thought made me sick.\n\n\u201cBecause.\u201d Wylan groaned. \u201cThere was something inside that fucking wine.\u201d He blew a raspberry. \n\n\u201cObviously.\u201d\n\nMrs Beck nodded. \u201cYes, Wylan,\u201d she said, as shadows bled across the floor. As if they were sentient, they inched closer to us.\n\n\u201cThank you for once again admitting you are a smartass little brat.\u201d The teacher pointed at her own lips, and then her chin. \u201cBut you have something on your\u2026never mind.\u201d Her eyes found mine. \u201cBut seriously, are you not going to remind your peers of our agreement? Indeed I am a survivor.\u201d Mrs Beck\u2019s eyes glittered. \n\n\u201cWhich they of course wiped from the headlines in case it got out that I\u2026 Well, I didn\u2019t exactly come back alone.\u201d Mrs Beck\u2019s voice was enough to jolt my body, sending shockwaves spiking through me. \u201cMight I congratulate you!\u201d she said. \u201cThat was a perfect performance! You really showed an authentic look at survival. And might we celebrate your opening night with a drink,\u201d she held up the bottle of wine. \n\n\u201cAnd some truths.\u201d\n\nHer smile widened, and for reasons I will never understand, I trusted it. \u201cBefore we take this production to, let's say, the next level?\u201d\n\nMy head spun when I was yanked back to the bus.\n\nSo many questions I had.\n\nThough it took me a moment to realize me being pulled from the memory was not supposed to happen.\n\nThe foundations of the simulation began to falter, and I started to see what was at the root of it, deeply embedded code entangled with my brain.  The shadows at the back suddenly had faces. Their teen selves, thankfully. \n\nAlyssa, sitting with her knees to her chest. Noah, blank eyes on the ceiling. Wylan, his head bowed, eyes closed. They looked exactly like they did on opening night; still in their costumes soaked in my best friend. It was surreal seeing them turning from shadows to people I knew from what I had been forced to see. Another jolt, and the three of them came to life suddenly,  their frightened eyes finding mine. Noah jumped up automatically, his lips curled into a snarl. \u201cKey.\u201d He gritted out. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\nAlyssa\u2019s lip wobbled, her frantic gaze searching for a way out.  \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to be here\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be here!\u201d\n\n\u201cIs anyone planning on telling me what the fuck is going on?\u201d\n\nWylan was the only one who hadn\u2019t jumped from his seat. Instead, he shuffled back, his knees to his chest.\n\nNoah scrubbed his face with his hands. \u201cYeah, yeah, we know,\u201d We were all in our own individual self-reflection treatment, But the better question is, Kiera here,\u201d His glaring eyes found mine. \u201cDid something.\u201d Noah grabbed a seat when the bus rattled. \u201cDid you give those bastards the code?\u201d When I couldn\u2019t answer, he tipped his head back. \u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\"\n\n\u201cNo, I mean, I\u2026 I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nWylan\u2019s voice, which was very un-Wylan, because the boy was almost in tears. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.\u201d His eyes found mine, though I found no recognition in his eyes. It was like staring at a completely blank slate. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d\n\nAlyssa blinked, and Noah, for a moment, looked confused. Before he slapped himself in the face.\n\n\u201cOf course he did!\u201d he rolled his eyes. \u201cThe teacher\u2019s pet couldn\u2019t stand his own memories so he chose the other option.\u201d\n\nNoah\u2019s gaze met mine, two pools of oblivion glaring back. \u201cHe chose reset, or what I like to call it running a-fucking-way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Alyssa lifted her head, her eyes red from crying. \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means he\u2019s a coward, Lyssa!\u201d\n\n\u201cI apologise, patient 067, 068, 069, and 070,\u201d Allison\u2019s voice prickled on the intercom, grabbing our attention. \u201cDue to a manual override, I am unable to\u2026 safely\u2026. please\u2026 remove\u2026. immediately. I ask that you stay\u2026 please\u2026 resist. You are not\u2026 ready. Do you hear me?  Stay where you are. I cannot\u2026 I am trying to\u2026. Listen\u2026. do not, I repeat do not listen to any further\u2026 protocol 6\u2026 H\u20268\u20262.\u201d Repeat\u2026 we are\u2026 Jack\u2026 stand\u2026 me? Emergency shutdown overridden. We cannot update\u2014\"\n\nThe simulation came apart once again, pixelating like a video game.\n\nI found myself at home, standing in my kitchen.\n\n\u201cThink clearly, Kiera,\u201d the voice this time spoke from in front of my physical self; warm breath tickling my frozen lips. \u201cSo we can pull you from this\u2026 ridiculous technology.\u201d\n\nThat voice\u2026\n\nI blinked.\n\nIn the memory,  a body hung from a hook, skinned and headless.\n\nThe head had been slowly cut and sliced into pieces and added to the stewing pot in my hands. I could still see her hair.\n\nMom.\n\nOh god, mom.\n\nIs this what I did? Is this what I did to my mom?\n\nAll at once, I was spiralling, and yet in the memory I held no emotion. I was a blank nothing with a wide, feral smile. Wylan joined me as I moved in slow strides with the boiling pot clutched to my chest. He was older. \n\n18 or maybe 19. His left eye was swollen shut, a rune sliced right through it.  Like Noah, obsidian tattoos wrapped around his lower wrist and arm, rich darkness curled around each of his fingers. Lily saw this. I felt sick. \n\nShe really did see us sinking into the abyss. \n\nI brought the pot outside, to kids I recognised. Adults. Neighbours. All of them knelt in front of us, bowls in front of them. My street was pitch dark, candlelight illuminating each window, and a ritualistic drum thudding down the road. Getting closer and closer to my house.\n\nTHUD.\n\nTHUD. \n\nI placed the steaming pot in front of our mayor, who lurched back, restrained by Noah and Alyssa, her cavernous eyes lit up in an orange glow, as she smiled through a mouthful of stringy flesh. No.\n\nNo, this couldn\u2019t be me.\n\n\u201cThe code, Kiera. Say it, and I can make this go away.\u201d\n\n\u201c4879.\u201d I whispered with no hesitation.\n\nI couldn\u2019t deal with it, with the sight of what I had\u2026 what I had done to my mother. \n\n\u201cKiera.\u201d Allison\u2019s voice shook. \u201cI do not recommend severing yourself from the program. While I am no longer in control, I can only advise. Kiera, you will revert to the self we are trying to\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cGet me out!\" I shrieked, followed by the dismantling code, which sent everything imploding around me, and pulling me. \n\nBack. \n\n\u2026\n\nWhile I DID break from the simulation eventually, I would have rather stayed in there.",

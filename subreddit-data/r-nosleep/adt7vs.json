    "postText": "**I am a firewatcher. Upon moving in to my station, I found the following pages typed on my desk. I am not the author of the following. I am transcribing exactly what I found, dated 1989:**\n\n---------------\n\n----\n\nI\u2019ve been located here for 185 days, according to my calendar. I\u2019m stationed up in the northwest of the United States with two other guys\u2014Clark and Thomas. \n\n185 days. That\u2019s five days longer than our stint here should\u2019ve been. Normally, they rotate us out every 180 days. We were supposed to be picked up by Helicopter 5 days ago.\n\nI started writing this logbook, journal, whatever, because we\u2019re overdue for evac. Or so we think. Maybe we messed up the calendar somehow.\n\nOur main radio stopped working on day 179.\n\n\u201cGet up! There\u2019s smoke.\u201d\n\nBleary-eyed, I saw Clark standing over my bunk. I could see the orange slits of light reflecting on his torso, signaling to me it was the early morning.\n\n\u201cTeddy! Smoke!\u201d\n\n\u201cSmoke? Huh?\u201d I said, still half-delirious.\n\n\u201cYes, smoke. A really small stream of it maybe a mile southeast.\u201d His eyes were wide and brighter than the sunlight on his uniform.\n\nI pulled myself out of the bottom bunk and headed towards the window. I didn\u2019t even need my binoculars to see the small sliver of smoke creating a shadow in the early sun\u2019s light. In 185 days, it\u2019s only the second time we\u2019ve seen a potential fire.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know what a fire watchtower looks like, it\u2019s basically a wooden cabin elevated about 100 feet in the air. Ours has a staircase that wraps around the structure beneath the cabin. I\u2019m pretty sure other towers use ladders, but that\u2019s beside the point.\n\nClark and I bunk up in the watch tower. We have a little kitchen, our bunk bed, and a 360-degree view of nothing but woods. Thomas sleeps in a tiny little cabin at the base of our tower, which is also where our main office is. \u2018Office\u2019 may be too loose of a term. It\u2019s one desk and a typewriter used for typing out reports of what we see out here.\n\nI rubbed my eyes and looked over to Clark, \u201calright, let\u2019s go check it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way, Teddy. No way,\u201d he replied immediately.\n\nClark has been afraid to go past the outhouse since day 180 passed. He\u2019s afraid a helicopter will come, and he\u2019ll miss his chance to be rescued.\n\n\u2018Rescued\u2019 Clark would say. But are we in danger? Did we miscalculate the number of days we\u2019ve been out here? We still have plenty of food. Did they forget about us? Has the apocalypse come and gone and we don\u2019t know because we\u2019ve been isolated?\n\n\u201cOkay, fine,\u201d I agreed, \u201cRadio down to Thomas and let him know. He should be up.\u201d\n\nOur main radio back to base isn\u2019t getting a sign of life from anywhere. And if it isn\u2019t receiving from anywhere, we assume we aren\u2019t being heard from anywhere. Luckily, we still have our own walkie-talkies to communicate with each other.\n\nClark took out his walkie.\n\n\u201cTom, there\u2019s some smoke about a mile southeast. Can you go check it out?\u201d\n\nA few seconds passed before Thomas responded.\n\n\u201cAfter I finish wiping my ass I\u2019ll be on my way. Unless you wanna help me with that Clarky.\u201d\n\nThomas, the oldest of us, is always picking on Clark, the youngest. He doesn\u2019t really dislike Clark. He is just easy to pick on. He\u2019s a twenty-three-year-old college dropout. I think he studied accounting or finance or something on his parents\u2019 dime. I don\u2019t think he left college to be a professional firewatcher. No, I think he left to come out in the wilderness, be alone, and take a retrospective look at his life to decide what he really wants.\n\nYou only sign up for 180 days of isolation if you\u2019re crazy, or if you want to get away from something. I\u2019m not sure which category Thomas falls is. He\u2019s a cryptic, brute of a man. His picture is probably in the dictionary next to \u201clumberjack.\u201d He\u2019s pretty quiet unless he has a joke to tell or something important to say. Either way, when he opens his mouth, I listen.\n\nAs for me, it\u2019s not important why I\u2019m out here.\n\n\u201cHeaded out now,\u201d Thomas radioed. \n\nClark and I watched Thomas start his trek into the tree line until we could no longer see him.\n\nClark cocked his head towards mine.\n\n\u201cTeddy,\u201d he said to me, \u201cThomas has been acting... different. Weird.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t expect him to be so blunt. But I had noticed. I knew Clark had noticed, but this was the first time we spoke about it.\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be bothered that we are stuck out here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t *know* if we are stuck out here. We could\u2019ve scratched off the dates wrong. You know\u2014we thought we didn\u2019t scratch the day off yet but we really did, so we accidentally scratch the next day too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess,\u201d Clark said softly. I knew what he was going to say next.\n\n\u201cAt night though\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShut it, Clark.\u201d\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon Teddy! It\u2019s fucked up. He\u2019s fine during the day and then just, just changes. Does he have some type\u2019a illness? It happened so sudden!\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe he does! So what if the guy goes out at night to stare at trees?\u201d\n\n\u201cTrees? Stare at trees?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019ve seen it. He goes out near the tree line and stands there for a while looking out. Sometimes hours. Maybe he does have a screw loose, and maybe he shouldn\u2019t be out here. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best idea to bring it up to him when we are trapped here with him, especially if he *is* insane.\u201d\n\nSilence fell between us before Clark responded.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know he stares out at the forest,\u201d he said to me in a soft voice and eyes wider than when he woke me up this morning.\n\n\u201cOh\u2014wait, what? What were you going to say?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt\u2014At night,\u201d he stammered, \u201che comes up the stairs.\u201d\n\nI looked over to our half-open door leading out to the staircase, letting a cool breeze in.\n\n\u201cWh\u2014what do you\u2014what?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe comes up the stairs, and, and just, looks at us. Stares at us.\u201d\n\n------------\n\nThomas left to go check out the smoke about an hour ago. It seems to have vanished, so I figure he handled it. \n\nClark spends his days using our walkie talkies, trying every station possible to alert anyone nearby.\n\nI just watch the forest.\n\n---------------\n\nIt\u2019s 11:30 PM. Thomas isn\u2019t back. He left at about 7 AM. He hasn\u2019t answered his radio.\n\nTomorrow will be day 186. We do not know if Thomas is okay, and one of us will most likely have to check the woods tomorrow\u2014and since Clark is chicken-shit, it'll end up being me.\n\nMore disturbing though, is something Clark told me a few minutes ago\u2014the reason I went back to the office to type this.\n\nI was leaned back in my swivel chair, spinning slowly, making sure there were no lights or fires in the dark expanse of trees, and wondering where Thomas was. He must\u2019ve been hurt. Even if he was lost, he\u2019d reply on his walkie. We always answer our walkies. They\u2019re with us at all times, even when we are shitting or showering.\n\nClark stopped my chair mid-spin and mid-thought. Before I could protest, he spoke.\n\n\u201cListen. I need to tell you something I\u2019ve been thinking about recently. It\u2019s eating away at me.\u201d\n\nI wondered if it had to do with Thomas.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to sound crazy,\u201d he warned.\n\n\u201cI bet I\u2019ve heard crazier.\u201d\n\nHe took a long, yet stuttered inhale, then spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t remember coming out here.\u201d\n\nMy facial expression didn\u2019t change, and it looked like he was waiting for a reaction, so he repeated.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember coming out here. Do you? Do you remember applying for this job? Do you remember being interviewed? Or being flown out here?\u201d\n\nAt first, I was almost amused. \n\nThen as he asked those questions, I froze.\n\nI didn\u2019t remember.\n\nHe continued, \u201cYou know how I said I decided to leave college? Well, now that I\u2019m thinking about it harder, I don\u2019t know if I did. I mean I must have, right? To be out here? I must have. But all I can remember is my last day of class for the semester, and then I was here. I don\u2019t remember anything between coming home after class and meeting you and Thomas.\u201d\n\nI was listening, but it probably didn\u2019t show. I was still motionless.\n\nI couldn\u2019t remember. I tried and am still trying.\n\nThomas is missing.\n\nClark and I are losing our minds or\u2014or something else.\n\nEither way, I can\u2019t explain it yet.\n\n-----\n\n----------\n\n**There are more pages scattered about, but I haven\u2019t figured out the order. Some are ripped and some are faded beyond recognition.**\n\n**But there is a more pressing and imminent problem at hand.**\n\n**About 30 minutes ago I met Gary and Harold. We have been stationed out here for the next 180 days.**\n\n**I don\u2019t know whether to tell them what I\u2019ve found.**\n\n**And I don\u2019t know whether to tell them that I don\u2019t remember coming here.**\n",

We all had a walkie in case we needed medical evac but we were supposed to have radio silence for the week unless absolutely necessary. Well the radio started going on the second night we were out there. And what guys were saying didn't make sense and I know only 3 of us made it the week in the woods. The other 3 of them left the state one killed himself a few months after the incident and the other guy went missing a few years ago. The screams of these guys on the radio is something that I still wake up to. ",

We were at a campground in Utah/Arizona. this was in the Late fall so not a ton of people there. We chose a campsite away from everyone else. After a day of hiking, we returned to camp. After we finished dinner and were getting ready for bed this car pulled up to the site next to us. No problem they just showed up late. But they didn't get out. They just sat in their car. I had an uneasy feeling. the car then backed out and drove up to our spot and parked in front of our truck trapping us. They then turned on their brights blinding us. I had never wished I had a gun more than that point. I pulled out my knife (just a small 3\" blade). We also had a hatchet and of course Buddy who was very protective. They just sat there in the car. Finally, I started to walk towards them. They then backed out and screeched away before I could get close. They drove around the campground a bit and then drove off into the night. I have no clue what that was but I was nervous to climb into my tent that night.  ",

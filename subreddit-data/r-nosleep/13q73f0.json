    "postText": "*This is for my son, for when you\u2019re ready to know the truth. I\u2019ve kept these secrets quiet for too long. Let\u2019s start after a drug deal went bad. That\u2019s where everything began falling apart.*\n\n\r  \n\r  \nI was in the back seat of Shooter\u2019s cream-colored Impala, even though no one was riding shotgun. It was especially hot that day, even for Reno. The tires seemed to bleed onto the pavement. Shooter\u2019s car had that familiar smell of stale blunts and cracked leather.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Of course I\u2019m ready.\u2019 He\u2019d been on his cell phone ever since he\u2019d picked me up. \u2018You sure it\u2019s him?\u2019 He pulled out a snub-nosed revolver from the glovebox.  \n\r  \nHe\u2019d called me about twenty minutes prior and, in a dark mutter, said they\u2019d found the guy who stole my money. \u201cOur money\u201d was how he put it.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Are *you* ready?\u2019 Shooter asked. I opened my mouth and almost replied before realizing he wasn\u2019t talking to me. Shooter talked on the phone like everyone was in on the conversation.\r  \n\r  \nMy heart was thumping hard as I ran through the possibilities of what came next. When I got the news that I was ripped off, the first thing I did was calculate how long I could keep my *ability* in check. After that: vengeance.\r  \n\r\r\r  \n\u2018I got my boy Tony with me\u2026 Tony.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI squirmed in my seat at the sound of my name. The voice on the other end didn\u2019t like what he'd heard. I was an unknown. Another variable.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Muthafucker, he\u2019s in it too,\u2019 Shooter said. \u2018Keep watching. Call me back if he leaves.\u2019 He hung up and looked at me in the rearview, still holding the gun low. \u2018You ever shoot one of these?\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI stared at it. Shooter\u2019s real name was Tracy, but no one\u2019s supposed to know that. Thinking about his real name helped calm me down, giving me a quiet edge when Shooter got all *more-gangsta-than-thou*.\r  \n\r  \nHere\u2019s the truth: It was lonely growing up as a black kid in a tiny town in northern Wisconsin. My mom took a job on Polaris\u2019s engineering team and the two of us left Chicago when I was four. It was in Siren where I came home crying from kindergarten. The teacher had said something about \"your people.\" But Mom wouldn\u2019t hear nothing about it. She told me it was a safe school away from the guns. She hated guns and never let me go near them, which made me even more of an outcast, living in rural Wisconsin. So no, I had never even held a gun before.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I can figure it out,\u2019 I said.\r  \n\r  \nShooter slanted his eyes at me, barely giving the road attention. \u2018You sure? I can drop you off,\u2019 he said.\r  \n\r  \nI stopped bouncing my knee. \u2018It\u2019s my money,\u2019 I said.\r  \n\r  \nShooter set the gun on the front seat.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Dude screwed a lot of people, not just you. My brother\u2019s still in County cuz a him.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I need this shit for work, understand?\u2019 I said, clenching my fists. \u2018You said this guy was legit. Said our other guy was charging too much. If I\u2019m dropping money, I expect a product.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Shit. I didn\u2019t realize I had Tony Montana in the back seat.\u2019 Shooter\u2019s laugh was slow and grim. \u2018You make bank at the casino, I thought. Poker or something?\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Something like that,\u2019 I said. I looked out the window. The cement outside refracted the light and rattled my brain, even through the tinted glass.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Something like that. Yeah,\u2019 Shooter repeated. I saw him eye the gun on the passenger-seat. \u2018I didn\u2019t pick you up so you could get your money back.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I\u2019m aware of that.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nShooter made another casual turn. The beat to \u201cAll Eyez on Me\u201d kicked on. His ringtone.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Ay yo. Wassup?\u2019 Shooter\u2019s tone changed. Lighter, friendlier. \u2018Where?\u2019 he said. \u2018Okay, five minutes. I got Tony with me\u2026 Oh, we\u2019re taking care of some stuff. Okay, I\u2019ll see you in a second.\u2019 He tossed his phone next to the gun. \u2018Evie says hi. Gotta pick her and Insyte up at the bus. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Evie?\u2019 I said, leaning forward. The A/C hit my face. It was refreshing despite its barnyard odor. I was suddenly excited for a different reason.\r  \n\r  \nWe pulled up to a hollowed out concrete shell with a bench. Shooter looked at me.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Hop in front, fool. Why you sit back there anyways?\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Thought you were my Uber,\u2019 I said.\r  \n\r  \nShooter laughed. When he meant it, his laugh made you feel good. I hopped out and the bright heat bodied me. I opened the passenger door and saw it. I froze. Maybe this was an elaborate hoax to get my prints on the gun. Shooter saw me and put the thing in the glovebox.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018You know who you sound like when you laugh?\u2019 I asked as I slammed the door.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Muthafucka, you white?\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018What?\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Only white people say I sound like Eddie Murphy.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Well\u2026\u2019 I cracked a smile.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I knew it. I knew there was something suspicious about you.\u2019 Shooter wagged his finger.\r  \n\r\r  \n\r\r\rA bus pulled up and squeaked to stop. A little boy jumped out followed by his mom. Evie had a large purse over her shoulder. She took off her sunglasses and squinted at the car. I caught her eyes in the sideview mirror and she looked away. You and your mother got in the backseat.\r  \n\r\r\r  \n\u2018Hurry up, we losing A/C. How was daycare, little bro?\u2019 Shooter asked as he adjusted the rearview mirror to look at his son.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Aight.\u2019 Your voice was soft. You looked out the window as the bleached sidewalk started to roll by.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Aight? That\u2019s it?\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Leave him alone,\u2019 Evie said. I could feel her gaze burning the side of my face. I stared at the glovebox.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Leave him alone? I\u2019m just asking how his day is.\u2019 Shooter moved the rearview to Evie.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018And he said *aight*.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nShooter backhanded me in my arm. I shrugged.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Hey Evie, guess who Tone-bone thinks I sound like.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Eddie Murphy,\u2019 she said without missing a beat. Shooter\u2019s shoulders dropped as he shook his head in disbelief.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Man\u2026 He ain\u2019t even white.\u2019 Shooter then eyed me. \u2018Wait. You ain\u2019t, is you?\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI laughed and shook my head. \u2018No.\u2019 I felt my cheeks flush. \u2018I am black, black as they come.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Black as they come. You an undercover brother.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018You stupid,\u2019 Evie said and poked Shooter on his neck with her long, perfectly red nails. We were all laughing. Shooter pulled into a Burger King. I pulled out my debit card and bought everyone\u2019s meal. No vengeance on that day.\n\n\r  \n\r  \n*I know, I know. A little anticlimactic, right? But I wanted to introduce you to your real father. You say you don\u2019t remember him, but I think you do. Next, I\u2019m going to introduce you to Lenny, the old man who recognized my ability and got me my job at the Diamond Casino.*\n\n\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Casinos are superstitious places,\u2019 Lenny said to me. He was on one of his tangents again. \u2018The house can have all the math in the world, but that\u2019s not their real edge. Say a blackjack dealer has a lower payout than the average dealer. We\u2019ll do everything in our power to keep him unlucky. Throw salt over shoulders while speaking ill of the dead, break a mirror and open an umbrella indoors while walking under a ladder: whatever.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI listened as we walked down the back halls of the casino.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Sadly, it never lasts, the Odds, in the end, always even out. Un-Lucky dealers become regular-Luck dealers because the Odds demand it. Then one day, the impossible happens. You listening, Anthony? A magical dealer comes along and not only defies the Odds, he spits right in His face. The Casino, they get worried, see, they don\u2019t know what to do with a dealer like this. They get cagey. We don\u2019t want to jinx this golden goose, they think, but at the same time, a dealer like you is impossible. Think about it, Anthony. If you can defy the rules, what\u2019s that mean for their system? Their stream of income? They want to cradle you, hold you like a little bird in their palm and coddle you.\u2019 He cupped his imaginary bird with both hands. \u2018Know why? It ain't love. It's fear. They want to hold on to you tight enough so you can\u2019t get away, but gently enough so you are nice and cozy. But if that bird were to bite\u2026\u2019 Lenny made a squishing noise between his two cupped hands. We entered the surveillance room.\r  \n\r  \nI granted him a stoic nod.\r  \n\r  \nHe continued: \u2018Casinos can act like they ain\u2019t superstitious. Odds are reliable. Science, dependable. The Diamond has microchips in every card. We know a deck\u2019s order and can bust a major play with these self-shuffling machines. Luck, on the other hand, she\u2019s many things, but dependable? Forget it, kid \u2013 like tickling a whore\u2019s titty. Odds may pay the bills, Anthony, but Luck, we pray to her. She\u2019s our god, our religion. You are an insult to that religion.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI fingered the eyedropper in my pocket, my secret weapon. Today was the day I was going to ask for a raise. I remained silent as Lenny proceeded with his soliloquy.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Superstition has no place mingling with the pious forces of Law and Order.\u2019 Lenny raised his hands in mock reverence. \u2018You, Anthony, are not illegal, but you also can\u2019t exist, understand? To truly make what you do illegal would force governments to acknowledge something that should not exist.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Okay,\u2019 I said. What else was there to say?\r  \n\r  \n\u2018And don\u2019t forget,\u2019 Lenny continued, \u2018it was me who found you. I cultivated you, made you blossom. You were a tourist once, some wayward traveler on one of them self-destructive searches for himself. Old Lenny offered you a job. Gave you a home. You can\u2019t put a price on a home. Don\u2019t get greedy. You more than anyone knows what happens when people get greedy.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nSomehow he knew my intention. I guess today wasn\u2019t the day to ask for a raise.\r  \n\r  \nWe stood in the surveillance room looking over the dozens of monitors. A guard sat in a chair, pretending not to listen to us. I looked at Lenny, seeing if he was done. His face was as old and wretched as this town. He wasn\u2019t born, I figured, just a byproduct of Reno. A caricature of a wiseguy. If you pulled him too far from the city limits, he\u2019d wither into dust. I couldn\u2019t help but look up to him though, even if he was full of shit 90% of the time.\r  \n\r  \nLenny pointed to monitor 17 and giggled. It was one of his marks from the other night. Lenny\u2019s \u201cmarks\u201d were straight men who\u2019d perform homosexual acts to get out of a bind. And in this town, there was no shortage of desperate men. But I was focused on monitor 6: some very weird colors.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018You look tired,\u2019 Lenny said to me. He rested his hands on the shoulders of the security guard and massaged gently. The poor guy\u2019s eyes went wide and his back stiffened.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been here and not seen you working,\u2019 I replied.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Yeah, well.\u2019 Lenny scratched at the rim of his nostril. \u2018There are secrets to being in more places than one. I myself am sleeping right now, you\u2019re speaking to my astral projection.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018You work while you sleep?\u2019 I said. \u2018That\u2019s sad.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018What\u2019s sad is a passionless person, you cretin.\u2019 Lenny said. His voice was always parched, gravelly and ragged. \u2018Your talent, your mystical ability to throw people off their game, it\u2019s a marvel, Anthony. Truly impressive.\u2019 Lenny kissed the tips of fingers. He then put his long arms on top of my shoulders and faced me. \u2018Our talents lead us to our passions, and our passions are where we belong, our home.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI followed as Lenny strode down the concrete hallway toward the casino floor. Lenny\u2019s slender body hunched as he walked, more so than when we first met five prior. The city was pulling him back in, reclaiming him.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018And your passion?\u2019 I asked, egging him on.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018You disappoint me with that jive.\u2019 Lenny\u2019s deeply lined face crinkled into itself. \u2018This casino, Anthony.\u2019 He raised his hands up as his answer. \u2018This town. All a temple to my passion.\u2019 He pushed open a set of double doors. The sounds of the casino washed against me like a brutal wave. Lenny seemed to be reinvigorated by the chaos, like he was breathing in fresh air.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018You may not believe me,\u2019 he said, \u2018but this town is alive. Physically \u2013 breathing and shitting \u2013 alive. Eating. Eating. Eating. And it\u2019s our job,\u2019 he jabbed me in the chest with an old finger, \u2018to keep Her sated.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI let the din of slots roll over me as we weaved through the floor. Each machine whispered a secret, a language only I could comprehend. We stopped next to an Egyptian-themed slot with a scooter-bound granny tapping at it like a zombie.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Tell me what you see,\u2019 Lenny said. It was the same thing he said to me at the start of every shift, the first thing he asked when he first met me. I closed my eyes.\r  \n\r  \nI looked underneath my eyelids. Outlines began to appear. Sparks of color, creeping shadows. \u2018Excitement,\u2019 I said. \u2018Which is a form of Lust, a craving for a change of fortune always just around the bend. Greed. Waste. Excess. Luck.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Beautifully said, my boy.\u2019 Lenny straightened his red blazer. \u2018It\u2019s a sacrifice. All a sacrifice.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018To the thing living in the city,\u2019 I said, testing.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018It *is* the city, wise ass. Maybe someday She\u2019ll show herself to you.\u2019 Lenny wetted his cracked lips.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Do the owners get to? Meet her?\u2019 I could never fully tell when Lenny was being sincere, so I had made a practice of playing along, because he\u2019d dish the most beautiful bullshit in return. He was definitely in a mood that day because his cup flowethed over.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018The owners?\u2019 He scoffed. \u2018Of this ghost ship? They\u2019re a revolving door, Anthony. Invisible hands. Boardroom stooges with tight ties and tighter assholes. Some,\u2019 he lifted his finger, \u2018might have an inkling. Maybe, but they know to not get too close. Owners need to remain separate. Out of principle. Can\u2019t fraternize with the subordinates. People like me, people like you,\u2019 he loosened his bow-tie, \u2018we manage their chattel. We\u2019re not meant to own. It\u2019s no disgrace to say it. We\u2019re house #####rs.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Lenny, you\u2019re white.\u2019 I had spent so much time with this man that nothing out of his mouth shocked me anymore. Maybe I should\u2019ve been upset, but there was something endearing about his brash, ludic honesty.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018To them, we\u2019re all #####rs. Now go start with the roulette tables, they need some tending.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Nametag on or off?\u2019 I asked, walking backward.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Oh, let\u2019s start with it off.\u2019 He winked and tossed me a black chip. I palmed it and headed off to those strange colors I had noticed on monitor 6.\n\n\r  \n\r  \n*So that\u2019s Lenny. Should he be canceled? Yes. One thousand times, yes. But then again, I should too. We\u2019ll get to that. First, let me describe my ability.*\n\n\r  \n\r  \nOn my way to the roulette tables I dropped a bit of solution into each eye. Instantly the casino became liquid, like it was wrapped in cellophane, all connected on glistening strands of spiderweb. The first time I dosed at the Diamond I was trapped in that crystalline web. Tentacles grew from the floor and wrapped around me. I thought I was going mad. There was a warmth guiding me. Certain threads refracted the light in odd hues. I tugged on one and a slot machine hit a jackpot. I pulled another and a warm glow enveloping a suave man rolling craps dissipated. It took a while, but it became a language only I could read. And with practice, I could also write.\r  \n\r  \nFive years in, I was a spider. Before I could even see the roulette tables, I could feel the color emanating from the area, a hot, pulsating green, pale and tacky. Something wasn\u2019t right. I rounded the block of poker machines and saw a lone player at the table causing the imbalance, a golden-orange with sharp edges to it. The tentacles seemed repulsed by his aura. He had about twenty grand in sloppy stacks of black and green chips. An absurd amount at a $15 minimum table. I could tell he wasn\u2019t a cheater, but his Luck was out of line. It was my job to balance it. The tentacles just needed a little coaxing to get their confidence back, that\u2019s all.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Devil\u2019s money. I got the devil\u2019s money,\u2019 the man sang to no one in a light tune. He had on baggy jeans and a loose-fitting button-up patterned with tiny whales.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Mind if I come in?\u2019 I asked.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Plenty of room. How you doing today?\u2019 The man said without looking up. He seemed happy to talk to someone, but tired. His eyes were red and he smelled like stale weed.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Good, good. You?\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Blessed, as always,\u2019 he said.\r  \n\r  \nI liked that answer. But I felt off-balanced, threatened even.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Name\u2019s Tony,\u2019 I said.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Uh\u2026\u2019 The man stammered for a moment as he placed his chips on some numbers. He finished his betting. \u2018Trace. Nice to meet you.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Doing well?\u2019 I asked, leaning into his orange. It was like a moving geode. All I needed to do was divert the concentration of this guy, make him self-conscious. I gazed at his chips, showing I was impressed, but also hoping to trigger a possessive response. Luck disliked anyone trying to cage her.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Devil\u2019s money.\u2019 Trace said and started slamming more chips onto the betting table, leaving sloppy stacks on numbers wherever opaque tentacles began to poke through the table, smashing them back like a whack-a-mole.\r  \n\r  \nI couldn\u2019t believe it. Could he see what I could see? There was no way. I took out a few of my own five-dollar chips and started placing them right on top of Trace\u2019s. He stopped betting and looked at me as I put a chip on every single one of his bets.\r  \n\r  \nThe edges of the orange prism softened. When you want to make a player change their behavior, the first step is to make them overtly aware of their actions. Mimicry is good for this, lowers a person\u2019s defenses, makes it easy for the tentacles to grab hold.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I could use some of that devil\u2019s money,\u2019 I said.\r  \n\r  \nTrace laughed. He had a big wide gap in his front teeth. His laugh was warm and sounded familiar. The tentacles recoiled at the sound.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I dig it. Okay. Let\u2019s go for a ride.\u2019 Trace\u2019s phone rang as the croupier shot the marble down its terminal vortex. \u2018Whaddup?\u2019 He said loudly. \u2018Guess. Ha! Yeah, I\u2019m still here. You think I still be here if I wasn\u2019t? Okay. Okay. I\u2019ll leave soon. Love you.\u2019 He hung up and looked at me. The croupier waived her hand over the table indicating no more bets. \u2018You got a woman?\u2019 he asked.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Nah...\u2019 My cheeks flushed. \u2018Too busy.\u2019 The orange glow seemed to harden and wobble, encroaching into my own space. It wasn\u2019t a bad feeling.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I got a baby,\u2019 Trace said, rubbing sleep from his eyes. \u2018Ten months old.\u2019 The white marble hopped around and landed on 27. He'd just won three grand. He pumped his fist and said in a half song, \u2018Devil\u2019s money.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI tried singing it back, \u2018Devil\u2019s money.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nTrace cracked up at that. His laugh was irksome and beguiling and I couldn\u2019t place why it sounded so familiar. \r  \n\r  \n\u2018I gotta roll. It\u2019s been real,\u2019 Trace said.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018But\u2026\u2019 I dropped my shoulders. \u2018Come on, one more. I can\u2019t do this on my own.\u2019 I smiled. It was a genuine smile, therefore persuasive. My smile had a kind of mischief in it that let me get away with more than I should.\r  \n\r  \nTrace pinched his nostrils closed and furrowed his brow.\r  \n\r  \nI felt my own tendrils leaving my body, like ink. Their color was different from that of the table\u2019s, a rich ultraviolet. I rubbed the dirty felt on the table like a dog\u2019s belly.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Okay, one more.\u2019 Trace started placing his chips down, only greens this time, less frequent, less confident.\r  \n\r  \nI followed suit, putting my chips on top, repressing a grin. It was a rush entrapping players in their own greed.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018You from here?\u2019 Trace asked.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Is anyone?\u2019 I rubbed my lower back and stretched. \u2018You mean how long I been stuck here? From Wisconsin originally,\u2019 I said. \u2018Been here about five years. You?\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Chicago, then Minneapolis, then Chicago, then Minneapolis, then Boy\u2019s Town, then Minneapolis, then LA, then Oakland, now here. I guess.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Impressive.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Puerto Rican women.\u2019 He clicked his tongue. \u2018Be careful. I got me baby now. Ten months old.\u2019 He showed me a photo on his oversized phone. The baby looked just like him, only with fairer skin. The marble dropped on 33; he'd hit again. Something wasn\u2019t right. I frowned.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 Trace said. \u2018Too much devil money for you?\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI caught myself and forced a smile. \u2018I try to be careful with ill-gotten money. Makes me nervous,\u2019 I said. \u2018Why you call it that?\u2019\r  \n\r  \nTrace smiled, beguiling in its own right. \u2018Oh, just shouldn\u2019t have it in the first place.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Rob a bank?\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Nah.\u2019 He waved his hand to dismiss the notion. \u2018Nothin crazy. I just help people find things.\u2019 He started to absently put down his chips on some numbers.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I see.\u2019 I put my chips on top again.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018What are you gonna do without me?\u2019 Trace asked.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Should I be worried? Seems like you can\u2019t get rid of this loot if you try.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nHe hit a corner bet. What the hell was going on?\r  \n\r  \nTrace started putting thicker stacks of chips down. This time, I didn\u2019t put mine on top. I didn\u2019t place them anywhere. Trace looked at me and raised an eyebrow. The croupier launched the ball. I took a deep breath, watching, waiting. I scanned the board and saw a golden worm-like tentacle creeping up on the 1. \u2018No more bets please,\u2019 said the croupier and I slammed my black chip on the glowing appendage. The ball bounced and bounced, much longer than usual. It landed on 1.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Damn, son,\u2019 Trace said.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I think it\u2019s time for you to get out of here,\u2019 I replied. I didn't want him to lose.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I think you\u2019re right.\u2019 He grabbed his chips. \u2018You have a blessed day.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI stared at the wheel. A maelstrom. I noticed more little white worms poking up from the table, checking if it was safe to come out. \u2018It\u2019s safe,\u2019 I said.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Excuse me?\u2019 The croupier tilted her head.\r  \n\r  \nI looked over my shoulder. Trace was at the cashier line. I made my way over.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Cashing out too?\u2019 Trace said.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Yeah, I suppose.\u2019 I scanned the space; no one else was near except for the two old ladies in their Rascal scooters. I took a breath. \u2018You said you can find things\u2026\u2019\r  \n\r  \nHe faced me but eyed the exit. \u2018Yeah?\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Well, I\u2019m always lookin for a little something.\u2019 I stuck my hands in my pockets.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I\u2019m not a pimp, if that\u2019s what you want. But maybe I should be.\u2019 He laughed.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018No.\u2019 I leaned in close and talked out the side of my mouth. \u2018I\u2019m a bit of a hobbyist, a chef, looking for some ingredients. I\u2019m working on a new recipe and my source has dried up.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Ooh, you an enlightened fool. Most bustas I know into dro. H, yay, I can do. Might need to make a trip out to the Bay. I\u2019d need some details. And how much? Need to be worth my while if I do.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018It\u2019d be worth your while. I have a list.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018What was your name again?\u2019 he asked. \u2018My friends call me Shooter.\u2019\n\n\r  \n\r  \n*If you hadn't pieced it together, that was the first time I met your biological father. But now, I\u2019ll thicken the plot. By the time you were three, I was sleeping with your mom. Yeah, I\u2019m garbage. But Shooter wasn\u2019t exactly a good role model either. And it\u2019s not like he was faithful to your mother. That doesn\u2019t excuse what happened to him, but I think that\u2019s why I let it.*\r  \n\r  \n*Remember how I was ripped off? We eventually found the guy\u2026 and, well, I\u2019ll just focus on the aftermath. Long story short, I was in a bad place.*\n\n\r  \n\r  \nLenny was standing outside the doors where we usually met, picking at his teeth with a deli toothpick. I had been hiding in a motel for over a week and he had finally convinced me to come back in. It was as I feared: with each step in the Casino, I felt healthier, saner.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Tell me what you see,\u2019 Lenny said.\r  \n\r  \nI inhaled. There was burnt plastic in the air, like the inside of over-heated circuitry. \u2018Sacrifice. Just like you say, Len.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018But why?\u2019 Lenny looked directly at me. \u2018Why do they play when they know they\u2019re going to lose?\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI shook my head. \u2018I don\u2019t know, Len. Why don\u2019t you break it down for me.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Trouble at the roulette table,\u2019 Lenny said. He lifted his hand to stop any objection. \u2018Trust me, kid. Get a little work done. Cool this sniper off. You\u2019ll feel better. You\u2019ll see.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI walked the old path through slot machines. Tentacles glowed hot green. Shades of former people roamed about. Aimless souls, completely consumed by this place.\r  \n\r  \nI noticed a familiar color at the tables. I stopped. There he was. Just like when we first met. Only he looked halfway into shadow. His eyes were bloodshot and he had nearly a hundred grand in front of him. Shooter looked up and saw me.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018There he is,\u2019 he said, cracking a tired smile. I been looking for you.'\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I\u2019ve been sick,\u2019 I said.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Sick.\u2019 Shooter rocked his head in tiny affirmation. His eyes were bloodshot. Electric veins flashed in his aura.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Shooter, man, you okay? You don\u2019t look so hot.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Fine. Fine. You try standing here for two days straight.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I\u2019m sure they\u2019d comp you a hotel,\u2019 I said.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018They did. But I got to get rid of this devil money first. Half this yours anyway.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018That ain\u2019t mine.\u2019 I lifted my hands.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Afraid so.\u2019 Shooter started to straighten the stacks of chips. \u2018Some people concerned about you disappearing like you did\u2026 after you took part. When you don\u2019t share in the devil\u2019s money, people start to worry.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI hissed through gritted teeth, \u2018I don\u2019t want any of that. You can keep my part.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nShooter pushed five thousand dollars on a column. A one-in-three chance. I hesitated, looked behind me, then put a hundred on top of Shooter\u2019s chips.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Like old times, yeah.\u2019 Shooter looked at me direct in the eyes and then rolled his gaze to the table. \u2018They keep trying to move me to a different table,\u2019 he said. \u2018Say I be more comfortable with the high rollers. I tell \u2018em I\u2019m good right here. Raised the maximum for me least.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nThe marble landed. It didn\u2019t hit. Shooter slowly put his weight back on the stool. \u2018Can\u2019t win em all.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018You\u2019re still up, right? What you start with?\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Ten. But it don\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll get it back. But you bet first.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI observed the table. Fat maggots left trails of effervescent ooze \u2013 except around 8. I put a chip on 23. Shooter grabbed my wrist and squeezed.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Like you mean it,\u2019 he said.\r  \n\r  \nI held Shooter\u2019s dead gaze for a moment. I let out a breath and put the chip on the 8. Shooter smacked a grand on top of it.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Police stopped by,\u2019 Shooter said. My ears immediately started to ring, muting all other noise. \u2018Pigs asked some questions about a missing friend of ours.\u2019 He spoke in a low mumble. It was the only thing I could hear, like we were in a tunnel. \u2018Now I got people askin about you. They want to know where you been. As I\u2019m the only one who knows you, they ask if I trust you.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nThe marble landed on 8 and neither of us cared.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I tell em, Tone-bone? He\u2019s my busta. I take a bullet for that busta. Even if he a smug little bitch sometimes.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nA dead chill ran through me. My breath was being chopped by the thump of my heart.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Then I start to think. I start to wonder,\u2019 Shooter said.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Shooter\u2014\u2019 I began.\r  \n\r  \nShooter spoke over me, \u2018I wonder what he does in his time off. So I look for him.\u2019 His gaze had a darkness to it that I\u2019d never seen before. \u2018I check his work. I check his pad. He\u2019s not around. So, I think, just maybe I check my girl\u2019s line. I pay the bill for it, so it couldn\u2019t hurt to check\u2026 And I see just what kind of busta I deal with all these years. I see this and I start to wonder if a busta will fuck your bitch, your baby\u2019s mamma, he ain\u2019t far from fucking you.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI tried saying, \u2018I didn\u2019t,\u2019 but all I could do was wheeze.\r  \n\r  \nShooter grabbed my side and squeezed a chunk of flesh, forcing me back into the stool. He leaned in. His breath was sour.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018You didn\u2019t what? Fuck my woman?\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018No. I mean, not that,\u2019 I said, \u2018I didn\u2019t\u2026 say nothin.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018So you did? Come on. Let\u2019s go for a ride.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nShooter showed me a flash of dark metal at his waist. The gun. The next thing, a large man with no neck was there, bearhugging Shooter. The gun fell to the carpet with muted fanfare. Lenny picked it up and put it into his red coat pocket.\n\n\r  \n...\n\n\r  \n\u2018Tracy Anderson.\u2019 Lenny read from Shooter\u2019s ID. We were in a room, windowless and metallic \u2013 one I had never seen before. Lenny had put a key into the freight elevator and we went to a basement level I didn\u2019t know existed. The whole place smelled like a musky steam-room. I was a statue in the corner, keeping my eyes at the legs of the metal table between me and Shooter. He was zip-tied to a weird chair. The hindlegs were bolted to the floor and Shooter\u2019s arms were bound behind him. \u2018So sorry about the eye. We\u2019ll see about some ice.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI lifted my gaze to find Shooter\u2019s good eye staring right back at me. His left eye was bulging like a moldy peach. Lenny flicked the ID onto the table; it spun three, four times, then stopped. Lenny rested his hands on Shooter\u2019s shoulders \u2013 his crooked fingers caressed Shooter\u2019s glistening jugular. Its pulse was noticeably active. The chorus of breaths the three of us made in that room bled into one deep and hungry moan.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018You ever notice the carpet around here?\u2019 Lenny said, looming behind Shooter. He massaged tiny circles on Shooter\u2019s shoulders with the tips of his old fingers. \u2018No one ever notices the carpet. The most tremendous in Nevada. I\u2019m not even sure your friend Anthony knows this, but each and every square has a unique symbol on it.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n*Your friend*? I had never mentioned Shooter to Lenny.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Did you know that, Anthony?\u2019 Lenny asked. I said nothing. \u2018The Diamond\u2019s floor is like a novel no one knows how to read. Can you imagine the care that was put into such a detail? Just to be walked on. Somehow that fact makes it more special to me, you know? That it\u2019s meant to be stepped on all over.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I can\u2019t feel my fingers,\u2019 Shooter said. A drop of blood splattered on the floor behind the chair.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018We\u2019ll see about your zip-ties, but Tracy, you did pull a gun on my employee of the month.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nLenny moved in front of Shooter and sat on the table. His feet dangled just off the floor.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Wasn\u2019t gonna use it,\u2019 Shooter said through a clenched jaw. \u2018Tryna scare him.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Did it work?\u2019 Lenny looked at me and winked. \u2018Were you scared?\u2019 He turned back to Shooter and leaned next to his ear. \u2018Why would you try to scare him?\u2019 he whispered.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I thought we was ####as,\u2019 Shooter said, looking at me.\r  \n\r  \nI watched a few more drops of blood from Shooter\u2019s bound wrists hit the floor behind the chair. There was something queasy about this room.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Him?\u2019 Lenny pointed at me with a thumb over his shoulder. \u2018No, Anthony\u2019s my ####a.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Fuck you old man. Call the police. I\u2019m gonna sue you fucks.\u2019 Lenny put his hand on Shooter\u2019s scalp and ran his fingers through his short hair. \u2018Fuck you!\u2019 Shooter snapped his head out of Lenny\u2019s claw.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Tracy, Tracy, Tracy. Use your head!\u2019 Lenny knocked the top of Shooter\u2019s skull with his knuckle. \u2018Look around you. Do you see any cameras here? Have you seen a single camera since we got off the elevator? Something tells me you\u2019re the kind of guy who\u2019d notice that sort of thing.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI scanned the pale metal walls and ceilings. No seams, not even a spot for a hidden camera. That\u2019s when I noticed my ability was muted. That room somehow quieted the lifeforce of the casino. It made me feel carsick. There was always some activity from my periphery, even when I wasn\u2019t dosing. I had grown accustomed to it, every white-toothed advertisement, dirty cab exhaust pipes, laundromat slots, mists of the city ascending from the sewer-grates.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018This is my favorite part,\u2019 Lenny said to me. He plopped onto Shooter\u2019s lap, straddling him. Shooter squirmed.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018You have a choice, Tracy. I\u2019m going to lay it out for you simply. Option one.\u2019 He lifted a finger. \u2018You don\u2019t suck my cock.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Fuck this shit,\u2019 Shooter said.\r  \n\r  \nLenny put his finger over Shooter\u2019s lips. Shooter closed his mouth and heaved a long breath from his nose. Lenny pulled his one finger from Shooter\u2019s mouth and then put two fingers back on his lips. \u2018Option two. You guessed it. You suck my cock.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Aw, fuck this. Fuck you. Tony, get me outta here. Tony!\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI opened my mouth to speak but it felt like the room was losing oxygen.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Ahh-ah-ah, let me finish, Tracy,\u2019 Lenny said. \u2018You need to know what happens next. You comfortable? I\u2019m not hurting you, am I? No? Say you take option two, we\u2019ll excuse our pal Tony here and you and me take care of business, badda-bing, and you\u2019ll be on your merry way, no questions asked, no harms, no fouls, evens and stevens\u2026\u2019 Lenny lifted his fingers off of Shooter\u2019s lips and brushed the puffy eye-socket with the tender backs of his fingers.\r  \n\r  \nI had to get out of there. But I did nothing.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Following me?\u2019 Lenny went on. \u2018Option one... is a gamble! I might let you go. Same as option two. Maybe I give you all your winnings back. Or, Tracy, maybe I make a phone call to the Sheriff. He\u2019s a good friend of mine. Loves my calls. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a case or two he\u2019d like to discuss. Leave the matter with the pigs. I bet that gun has an interesting story. Maybe I have some tough guys come in and make hamburger out of your other eye. Hmm? Maybe I\u2019m feeling nice. Maybe I get a whore to come in here, your choice, your style, whatever gets you going, Tracy, and I have her suck you off.\u2019 Lenny laughed. It was a giddy and disturbing laugh I had never heard from him. \u2018Or you can take option two, the sure thing, and walk.\u2019 He leaned in and ever so lightly put his lips on the Shooter\u2019s bruised eye.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Fucking fruit!\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Lenny,\u2019 I managed to choke out.\r  \n\r  \nLenny unstraddled Shooter and turned to me. \u2018It\u2019s okay. We\u2019re just having fun,\u2019 he said.\r  \n\r  \nShooter struggled against his zip-tie bonds. The trickle of blood intensified. The breathing of the room quickened.\r  \n\r  \nLenny\u2019s knees cracked as he squatted down. He put his hand on Shooter\u2019s thigh and whispered, \u2018What if I suck yours?\u2019 Lenny made two little legs out of his fingers and started to tip-toe up Shooter\u2019s leg. \u2018Fear, Tracy, is a very peculiar beast. We all react in unique ways. Interestingly, a small subset of people become sexually aroused when they're afraid. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re in that group.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Tony, please\u2026\u2019 Shooter said.\r  \n\r  \nLenny\u2019s hand meandered upward. \u2018I just had a funny thought!\u2019 he said. \u2018What if you\u2019re afraid of getting turned on?\u2019 Lenny laughed again, but it wasn\u2019t giddy that time, it was cold. I could feel the pulse of Shooter\u2019s jugular echoing off the walls. Lenny\u2019s fingers stopped at Shooter\u2019s inner thigh. He looked up at Shooter. \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 His fingers start to press gently at Shooter\u2019s crotch. \u2018Oh my, Tracy. What is this?\u2019 His fingers press a little harder, quicker.\r  \n\r  \nShooter closed his eye. \u2018Oh God please, no.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Afraid, Tracy? Afraid you\u2019re getting excited? Mmmm. I can feel it, Tracy. You want me to suck your cock, don\u2019t you? You\u2019re a little fruit. You want me to suck that big cock of yours, fruit?\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Lenny!\u2019 I said.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018It\u2019s his call!\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Fuck you, old man. Gonna fuckin kill you.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nLenny put his hands on Shooter\u2019s knees and used them as support to stand upright. \u2018We\u2019re at the buzzer, Tracy. Time to decide,\u2019 he said.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Just let me go.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Is that option two you\u2019re taking?\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Fuck no. Fuck you. I bite anything off. I fucking promise you.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018You sure, Tracy? No take-backs.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018You won\u2019t do shit. Tony, help,\u2019 Shooter said.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Time to decide, Tracy,\u2019 said Lenny.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Tony, please.\u2019 The drops of blood connected to make a small pool underneath the chair.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Three seconds\u2026\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Tony, get me out of here.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Two\u2026\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Please\u2026\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018One\u2026\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I won\u2019t\u2026 Fuck you, bitch. I won\u2019t.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nLenny looked at me with a satisfied, full smile. His mouth was a black pit with a green circus inside.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I knew he\u2019d say no.\u2019 He started to massage Shooter\u2019s chest. \u2018I was hoping you\u2019d say that, Tracy.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Lenny\u2026 what\u2019s going on?\u2019 I had to stop it but I hadn\u2019t moved from my corner.\r  \n\r  \nLenny walked toward me. \u2018Excuse me,\u2019 he said.\r  \n\r  \nI stepped aside and saw what Lenny was reaching for: a red switch, almost resembling a fire alarm lever. Lenny pulled it. Behind Shooter\u2019s chair a trapdoor swung open. A dry, translucent mist radiated from below. The room\u2019s breathing became excited; a thumping pulse vibrated the walls. I noticed the hind legs of the chair weren\u2019t just bolted to the ground \u2013 they were on a hinge.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018The fuck,\u2019 Shooter said, struggling to look behind him.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018You see it?\u2019 Lenny asked. \u2018Option one!\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI crept closer, drawn to a motion underneath the trapdoor, something fleshy and opaque. Massive and glowing. Ghastly intestines tugged on an assembly. I heard moans and whispers.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018No\u2014 the fuck is\u2014 I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 Shooter tried to stand and the zip-ties ripped into his wrists. \u2018Lenny, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll suck your dick, Lenny. I promise.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Too late, Tracy. You had your chance.\u2019 Lenny grabbed the chair and started to tip it back, slowly. Shooter screamed and flailed as if in a straightjacket.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018The fuck is that? I got a son! Please. I got a baby boy, he\u2019s everything to me. Please. Tony! Tony! No!\u2019 His voice raised in pitch as Lenny lowered the chair. \u2018No! Please!\u2019\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019d like to say this is where I stopped this madness, but I was transfixed. Somehow I knew this was the Truth. A phosphorus pink mist reached for Shooter through the trapdoor, churning like waves in a pot, turning into the shape of hands before spilling away. Lenny was clearly relishing the slow tip of the chair backwards. I saw green steam leaking out of Lenny and embrace with the substance below. His physical form became faint. Lenny looked at me and smiled. He had no skin. It was a skull smiling at me.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018I\u2019m sorry. Please, no! Fuck you!\u2019 Shooter screamed.\r  \n\r  \nA green snake-like thing wrapped around the chair leg. It pulled but Lenny didn\u2019t let go, like someone tugging with a dog\u2019s meat. More tendrils latched to the chair. I could hear a voice, no, many voices, call out. A strand wrapped around Shooter\u2019s neck and slid into his mouth. Shooter made a gurgling cry. He convulsed, like the chair was electric, back arched about to snap.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Lenny! This ain\u2019t right, man.\u2019 I said. Maybe I didn\u2019t. I was drawn in by what was below. The breathing from underneath liquified my bones. Whispers like rocks strewn about on a frozen lake.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018It\u2019s a sacrifice, Anthony!\u2019 Lenny smirked, a parched desert on his lips.\r  \n\r  \nThe tendrils whined and ripped at Shooter. Lenny let go and the chair swung down into the pit. I heard both of Shooter\u2019s shoulders snap. His hands were still zip-tied to the chair. His body was twisted in ways it shouldn\u2019t. I inched closer to the trapdoor. A river of hot, visceral light flowed over my old friend. A disconcertingly high-pitched scream came from Shooter and then I heard echoes of satisfied moans before the chair swung back into its upright position and the hatch slammed shut.\r  \n\r  \nI fell to my ass in a daze. \u2018It\u2019s not right\u2026 It\u2019s not right.\u2019 My heart was tingling. I wanted to cry. No, that\u2019s not true. I\u2019m not sure what I wanted.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018It\u2019s what you wanted,\u2019 Lenny said. \u2018He\u2019s out of the way.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Not like this,\u2019 I said.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018You don\u2019t need to run away to have her. She\u2019s yours.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nNo words escaped me. Lenny closed his eyes and nodded with deep reverence.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018The more you sacrifice, the more you gain.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\u2018But\u2014\u2019\r  \n\r  \nLenny shushed me. \u2018That boy needs a father now. Don\u2019t abandon him like your daddy did. He was afraid of having a home. Are you, Tone-bone? Because you\u2019re home now.\u2019",

But it clearly enhances your luck-vision. Does it do anything like this for other people, or is the effect unique to you?\n\nVery well told, by the way.",

There was a section where Lenny says that dosing only \"opened the door\" but only I could walk through it, but I had to cut out a lot to fit it all in one post. I suppose there's got to be others with similar abilities out there.",

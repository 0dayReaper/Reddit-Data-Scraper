    "postText": "[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/diuucz/my_sugar_daddy_asks_me_for_weird_favors/)\n\nI didn\u2019t leave my house for almost an entire week. \n\nThe only reason I didn\u2019t stay indoors for longer is that I had an important exam in one of my classes that I absolutely had to be present for. \n\nThat also didn\u2019t help with the anxiety I was feeling. As I drove to campus I kept my eyes glued to my surroundings, almost running two stop signs and a red light. I kept expecting Jack--- or fake Jack I suppose---to pop out randomly on the side of the road, or in the car next to me, or the car behind me. I constantly glanced at my rearview mirror trying to figure out if the black truck behind me had been there this whole time or if it was different than the one I had seen ten minutes ago. \n\nI hadn\u2019t told him where I went to school so maybe he wouldn\u2019t know. Then again, I hadn\u2019t told him where I lived either, and he seemed to figure that one out rather quickly. \n\nI hadn\u2019t texted the real Jack since the incident had happened. I mean, I didn\u2019t even know what I was supposed to say. \n\n\u201c*Oops I didn\u2019t follow all your rules and now there\u2019s a weird look-alike of yours running around the city*\u201d?\n\nMy plan, as foolish as it was, was to act as if all was well. I wasn\u2019t going to stir the pot by telling him I had already fucked up, so instead, I was going to wait until he realized that something was wrong. Hopefully, he wouldn\u2019t. \n\nI will admit that not telling him was more difficult than I had thought, and I found myself constantly checking my phone for texts from Jack, but none appeared. \n\nI finished my exam that day, sure that I had failed due to my lack of focus, and drove back home where I found Julio standing in my driveway. He was looking down at his phone, and I attempted to keep driving down the street before he saw me, but I wasn\u2019t fast enough. \n\nHe glanced and began walking towards my car as I slowly pulled into the driveway, locking my doors and trying to remain calm. Instead of shifting into park, I kept my foot on the brake and shifted into reverse, fully ready in case I needed to make a quick getaway. \n\nI sat in the driver's seat, looking forward, at my front door. I wondered for a second if I would be able to get inside and lock the door before Julio got to me. Suddenly, he leaned down and knocked on the window, making me jump. \n\nI turned to look at him and said nothing. \n\n\u201cRoll your window down.\u201d He said, motioning for me to lower the window. \n\nI pressed the button for a split second, making only a tiny crack of open space. \n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s not me you should be afraid of.\u201d\n\nI looked at him, and glanced at my rearview mirrors, trying to see if any of my neighbors were outside. But they weren\u2019t and I was alone with no witnesses. \n\n\u201cYou fucked it up,\u201d he said, leaning against my car. \u201cI told you to watch out, and you didn\u2019t. You managed to fuck up the rules in one night. They always miss at least one.\u201d\n\n*They*?\n\nI looked up at him but said nothing because I honestly had no clue what to say. \n\n\u201cGet out of the car, we\u2019re going inside.\u201d He tapped his hand on the roof of my car and walked towards my front door. \n\nI thought about driving away, but I wasn\u2019t sure where I would go, and a part of me wanted to hear him out. So, I found myself parking the car, turning off the engine, and letting Julio into my house. \n\nHe took a seat on my couch and glanced around my living room. \u201cThis is fancy for a college student. You buy this with Jack\u2019s money?\u201d He asked. \n\nI rolled my eyes as I stood in front of him. \u201cWhy did you want to come in?\u201d \n\n\u201cAlright, touchy subject,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cI need to talk to you about Jack.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich Jack? The one I\u2019ve been talking to or the one who appeared in the house?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He snapped, leaning over and resting his elbows on his knees. \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, the one who appeared in the house? Jack isn\u2019t back yet. I came here to tell you that you forgot to lock the door after your little house-sitting gig, which Jack won\u2019t be pleased about. He\u2019s very particular about his stuff. He\u2019s gotten rid of girls for much pettier shit than this.\u201d\n\nI said nothing and stared at Julio while he stared back, waiting for me to explain myself. His use of the words \u2018gotten rid of\u2019 made me nervous and I wondered what he meant by that. Surely he wouldn\u2019t kill me over a mistake, right?\n\n\u201cWas there someone else in the house?\u201d He asked after a few seconds of silence. \n\n\u201cJ-Jack. Jack was in the house that morning before I left.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you suppose that happened? Because Jack hasn\u2019t come back from his trip yet.\u201d\n\nI shrugged, not really knowing what to say. \n\nJulio stood up, sighing in annoyance. \u201cFine. You know what? I originally came over here to ask you for a share of the cash you got for your poor house-sitting job, but it seems to me that you probably fucked up more than I originally thought, so I\u2019m just going to stay out of whatever this is. Good luck.\u201d\n\nHe walked over and opened my front door, waving to me as he left, leaving me standing in my empty house. \n\nI ran to the door and locked it as soon as he was gone, and started to freak out once again. I thought about what I was going to do if Jack came back from his trip and found out that I had messed up. What if Julio was right and someone had broken into the house and robbed him? Maybe I just *thought* I saw Jack, but maybe it was just some other stranger who looked like him. My mind was going a mile a minute as I tried to figure out what to do. \n\nI paced around my house for a few hours before I finally decided that I was going to drive back to Jack\u2019s house and make sure that no one had broken in. If they had, I would simply make an anonymous police report or something. Besides, the only way he would ever know that it was my fault would be if Julio snitched on me, which it didn\u2019t seem like he was planning on doing anymore. \n\nI made the drive over in silence, trying to control my breathing so that I didn\u2019t have a meltdown on the highway. I finally pulled into the driveway and turned the engine off, but I couldn\u2019t work up the courage to get out of the car. I sat there for a few minutes, staring at the giant house, trying to force myself to unbuckle my seatbelt, open the door, and get out of the car. \n\nThe house, which once looked impressive, now made me feel anxious and out of place. I couldn\u2019t stop myself from imagining all sorts of horrible scenarios that I could stumble upon once I opened the door. I thought about how many possible hiding places there were in a house that large. \n\nI don\u2019t know how long I sat there before I finally decided to get out of the car and walk towards the front door. I hesitated for a few seconds before taking a deep breath and pushing the door open. Only it didn\u2019t open, because it was locked. \n\nI assumed that Julio had probably locked it and looked for the key on my keychain. I unlocked the door and stepped into the living room, taking a look around. \n\nEverything looked normal enough. There were no signs of breaking and entering or anything like that, and I was glad that Julio had come over and realized my mistake before someone else had. I closed the door behind me, this time double-checking that I locked it, and began to make my way further into the house. \n\nI went into the library first, which looked the same as it had when I left it. Next, I made my way through the living room, glancing around to see if anything was out of place, but nothing was. \n\nI was starting to feel better now that I had confirmed that no one had broken in and ruined the place. \n\nThat feeling was short-lived however when I walked into the kitchen. \n\nIt was a complete mess. Both the fridge and the freezer were wide open, all the containers of food emptied out. There were empty boxes of frozen foods tossed inside the freezer and on the kitchen floor. There were a few trays of meat that were laying out on the table and the counters, and some of the red juice from the meats had been spilled inside the fridge and now dripped down onto the floor. \n\nI noticed that while there hadn\u2019t been much food in there in the first place, it was all gone. As I got closer to the fridge, I realized that it wasn\u2019t cool, and the light inside the fridge wasn\u2019t working either. I assumed that whoever ate all the food also unplugged it for some odd reason. \n\nI stepped over an empty carton of orange juice and an empty crate of eggs as I made my way towards the stove where I found stacks of unwashed pans. One of them was still hot, meaning that it was only recently taken off the burner. There were eggshells all over the counter and I thought back to that morning when Jack, or whoever that was, had made me eggs for breakfast. \n\nI walked back out of the kitchen, careful not to step on the mess that littered the floor, and made my way down the hallway. \n\nI spotted the door at the end of the hall, and this time it was closed. As I continued to walk down the hall, I couldn\u2019t help but notice how eerily quiet it was in the house. I couldn\u2019t even hear the sound of the heater running. As I passed the thermostat in the hallway, I saw that it wasn\u2019t working. The screen was off and there was nothing on it like it had been turned off or something. I leaned forward and pressed a few of the buttons but none of them worked. \n\nI poked my head into the study, but that was also empty, although I did see that the landline had been used recently, and whoever used it didn\u2019t put it back. The handheld part was hanging off the side of the desk, and I stepped in, grabbing the phone and holding it up to my ear, but there was only silence. \n\nI put it back and followed the cord with my eyes. It was connected to the wall, but it seemed like there was no power in the house, which explained the refrigerator and the thermostat. I walked out of the study and headed down the hall again, but I froze in my tracks when I noticed that the door at the end of the hall was open now. \n\nSomeone was in the house. \n\nI reached into my back pocket and grabbed my phone, checking to see if maybe I had missed a text from Jack, but I had no signal inside the house. I held my phone in my hand anyway, hoping I\u2019d pick up enough signal to call for help, and began to back away from the door, listening carefully for any footsteps or noises that would let me know where the intruder was.\n\nAs I spun around, I found myself face-to-face with Jack. Or whoever it was that I was looking at. \n\nI knew he was the same man I had seen that morning, but no I had no idea who he really was. \n\n\u201cSorry!\u201d I said, startled. \n\n\u201cWhich one are you?\u201d He asked, squinting at me. \n\nHe was dressed in a stained gray t-shirt and old pajama bottoms that looked like they had been purchased thirty years ago. \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the new one, right? The one from the other day? You\u2019re the one who forgot to turn the television on.\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m so sorry. I thought I was being careful I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d\n\nI stopped talking as he started laughing. \n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d He asked, grinning. \u201cI should be thanking you!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d I asked him. \n\nI stared at his face, and he looked exactly like Jack, but I couldn\u2019t figure out why he was here when he said he was still on his trip. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m Jack.\u201d He replied as if he were stating the obvious.\n\n\u201cBut Jack said he wouldn\u2019t be back for a few days.\u201d\n\nHis expression changed and he narrowed his eyes at me. \u201cDid he tell you when he would be back? The exact date?\u201d\n\nI shook my head, confused, and thinking about how I was going to get past this man and get out of this damn house. \n\n\u201cBut you can ask him, right?\u201d \n\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know, he hasn\u2019t contacted me in a few days.\u201d\n\n\u201cDamnit, I was hoping it wouldn\u2019t be that bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you explain to me what the hell is going on?\u201d I asked him. \n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come back here.\u201d \n\nSomething felt off to me, and chills shook my entire body. Part of me regretted not going with my original plan of acting like everything was okay. I didn\u2019t want to stay in the house any longer, and there was really nothing that I could do anyway. Besides, I was getting a bad feeling from this guy claiming to be Jack. I slowly stepped past him, glancing back behind me as I continued to walk into the living room and towards the front door. \n\nI found myself walking faster and faster until I was basically running and throwing myself at the front door. I couldn\u2019t help but shake the feeling that something bad was going to happen if I stayed in this house any longer. \n\nI unlocked the door, but just as I was about to open it, I heard the lock slide back into place; only it sounded a lot louder than usual. I jiggled the doorknob and realized that while the doorknob wasn\u2019t locked, something else was, and it was keeping me from opening the door. \n\nI began to freak out as I pulled on the door urgently, trying to get it to open but something was keeping it shut. \n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d I said out loud. \n\nI glanced towards the hall as I heard another noise, but I quickly realized that it was the sound of air flowing through the vents. It seemed like the power was back, and somehow, some sort of security system had activated at the same time. \n\nI looked down at my phone and not only did I have a signal now, but I also had three messages from Jack. \n\n**I\u2019m back.** \n\n**What happened?**\n\n**I know you\u2019re in the house.** \n\nI looked around the room, trying to find him or any security cameras in the room that would be alerting him of my presence in the house. I didn\u2019t see any and grabbed my phone to text him back. \n\n**Are you here?**\n\nI held my phone in my hands as I made my way back towards the hallway to find the other Jack that I had seen earlier. If he even was another Jack. Maybe this was all the same person and he was just messing with me for some reason. \n\nA part of me thought that perhaps I deserved all of this for doing all of this in the first place. I mean, why was I so quick to agree to run random errands for a random man that I had never met? Sure, I needed the money, but going into a stranger's house has got to be on the list of the top ten dumbest things you could ever do. Especially considering the fact that no one knew where I was, and I didn\u2019t have a weapon to defend myself if I needed to. \n\nI stood in front of the closed door for a second, before making my way over to a window. I tried to open it, but the security system had locked the windows shut as well. I thought about breaking the window open, and I grabbed a sturdy-looking vase. I took a few steps back and then threw it at the window as hard as I could. \n\nThe vase shattered as it made contact with the window glass, but the window was fine, unscratched. \n\nThe only way I was getting out of here was through the door, but first, I had to disarm the security system somehow. \n\nI walked back to where I had left Jack, but he was gone and nowhere to be found. \n\n\u201cJack?\u201d I called, my voice echoing throughout the house. \n\nThe door at the end of the hall was closed once again, and I began to walk towards it, peeking into each room as I passed it, but there was no one else in the house. \n\nAs I reached the door, my phone buzzed in my hand. \n\n**You were supposed to follow the rules.** \n\nI stood in front of the door, trying to work up the courage to open it and see what was in the room. \n\n**I know, I\u2019m sorry. I came back to make sure everything was okay.** \n\nI reached out and grabbed the doorknob, taking deep breaths. The buzzing in my hand startled me and I ignored it as I turned the doorknob and pulled the door open. \n\nI stood in the threshold, at the top of a wooden staircase. Below it was a badly lit basement. I slowly walked down the stairs, glancing at my phone. \n\n**You should\u2019ve stayed away. You\u2019re really going to regret this.**\n\nI didn\u2019t reply and kept walking until I was at the bottom of the stairs. While I wasn\u2019t sure what I was expecting, it wasn\u2019t the normal-looking basement apartment that I had stumbled into. I found Jack sitting on the couch against one of the walls. He was reading a magazine and glanced up when he heard me step off the stairs. \n\n\u201cWhat are you doing!?\u201d He shot to his feet, as he shouted at me. \n\n\u201cThe door locked, I can\u2019t get out!\u201d I replied. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking *stupid*!\u201d He exclaimed, walking over to me.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s rude, how was I supposed to know the doors would lock when the power came back on?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to come back!\u201d He shouted, his face turning an angry shade of red as he yelled. \n\n\u201cI wanted to make sure everything was fine,\u201d I replied. \n\n\u201cWho cares?! You got a thousand dollars for house sitting! Why didn\u2019t you take it and leave?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy are you so angry? Why are you even here? You\u2019re clearly not Jack.\u201d I snapped, annoyed. \n\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d He asked, in a calmer tone. \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know I\u2019m not Jack? I look like the pictures you\u2019ve seen, don\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but Jack is on vacation,\u201d I replied. \n\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d He repeated. \n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d \n\n\u201cHave you ever met Jack in person? Have you ever talked to him on the phone? Video call? Anything other than a text message every few days?\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t reply, staring at him. He was right, he did look exactly like the photos I had seen on the Tinder profile. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d He replied to my silence. \n\n\u201cWhat are you saying exactly?\u201d I asked as I heard my phone buzz once again. \n\n\u201cHow do you know that the person you\u2019ve been talking to is a real person? As a matter of fact, how do you know that it\u2019s not me? Maybe this was my plan all along, to lure you here.\u201d \n\nAt that point, it finally hit me. He was right; I didn\u2019t know if I was talking to a real person. All that I was doing random favors for someone with an internet profile who wanted to pay me money to do these things for some reason. I guess I had always felt that there was something off about a sugar daddy who was willing to pay someone to do things other than having sex with them, but I needed to money too badly to spend too much time questioning it. \n\nI was feeling even more scared now, and my palms were cold and sweaty as I stood there, waiting for him to do something. I could run back upstairs, but I didn\u2019t think I was fast enough to get out of there and find something to jam the door and keep him downstairs. \n\nI took a shaky deep breath as I tried my hardest not to make it seem like I was scared. If Jack was dangerous, I didn\u2019t want to alert him of my plans to try and run.\n\nAfter a few seconds of silence, I glanced down at my phone to read the most recent text, but there were no new notifications. \n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t your phone,\u201d Jack said, breaking the silence. \n\nI looked up at him and glanced at the phone sitting on a nearby table. \n\nSuddenly, he jumped towards me and I attempted to jump out of the way but I was too slow. I saw Jack grab my arms and my phone fell out of my hands, and then everything went black. \n\nWhen I came to, I was on the living room couch and Jack was standing above me, looking down. \n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked. \n\nI attempted to sit up but I noticed that I was incredibly dizzy, and my left arm felt sore when I tried to prop myself up. I remembered Jack grabbing me earlier, and I figured he had gripped my arm too tight and must have bruised it in the process. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re finally up, good.\u201d He said. \n\nI slowly managed to sit up, wincing as I put weight on my left arm. I looked up at Jack, who was now standing a few feet away, with a bandage wrapped around his right bicep. \n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked, looking at the bandage, noticing that there was blood seeping through. \n\n\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t have come back.\u201d \n\nI tried to shift my position on the couch and winced in pain as I put weight on my left arm again. I turned to look at it, trying to see if I had injured it somehow, and noticed that it was also wrapped in a bandage similar to Jack\u2019s. \n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I repeated, looked down at my arm. \n\nI slowly reached over and started to unwrap the bandage until It came off and I was left staring at crudely done stitches on the inside of my bicep. \n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is this?!\u201d I snapped, looking at Jack. \n\n\u201cSorry Ivy, but you really shouldn\u2019t have come back. Although, I\u2019m kind of glad you did. I didn\u2019t really want to do this, but I need to get out of here.\u201d\n\nHe began to back away from me, heading towards the front door. I watched as he easily opened it, and wondered how he disabled the lock and if he had been the one to activate it in the first place. \n\nHe stepped out of the door and turned back to look at me. \u201cGood luck, I helped you out a bit while you were out,\u201d he said, motioning towards my phone which he had set down on the couch next to me. \n\nI stood up and went after him. Surprisingly, he didn\u2019t try to run or back up and simply stood about a foot away from the front door, watching me. \n\nAs I attempted to step outside, a stabbing pain erupted in my left arm, traveling throughout the rest of my body until I felt like I was being stabbed everywhere at once. I fell to the floor crying out in pain. Once I was back in the house, the pain went away and I laid on the floor shaking in the aftermath as I stared up at Jack. \n\n\u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cI had to get out. It\u2019s been eight months. I\u2019m sorry, you were just the first one to come back this time. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a good person but I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just going to leave me here?!\u201d I shouted. \n\n\u201cJulio will come by to give you food. And by the way, don\u2019t try to cut that thing out of your arm, this place is covered in cameras. If you do anything suspicious Julio will see you, and he won\u2019t hesitate to stop you. I learned that the hard way.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to say, and I stood there in shock as I watched Jack walk over to my car and get in it, starting the engine and disappearing down the street. \n\nI finally shut the front door and locked it, turning back to face the empty house. I glanced at my phone, which was still on the couch, and remembered what Jack said before he left. \n\nI walked over, trying not to move my arm too much as I picked it up and turned it on. My Tinder profile was open, only it had been changed and now my profile bio read: *Looking for a sugar baby. $700 weekly. No sex.*\n\nOn the table next to it, there was a list of house-sitting rules, similar to the ones that I had found on the day that I had been here. At the bottom of the page there was a lime green sticky note that read: *Sorry, I hope you\u2019re able to get out soon. Don\u2019t worry, maybe you won\u2019t be here for long. They almost always forget one of the rules. Good luck---Jack.*\n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/)",

Who was knocking on the door saying they were different people? \n\n2. Where did Jack get the money to pay her?\n\n3. How did he make her black out in the basement?\n\n4. Why didn\u2019t he just do it in the morning when she was eating?\n\n5. Why tf did he destroy the kitchen?\n\n6. Why was the power off then back on after she woke up?\n\n7. Most importantly, HOW did he walk her to her car if the chip or whatever was in his arm??",

Jack will likely be followed and watched for the rest of his life, and be silenced if he tries to speak out.  Julio is likely forced into his role as well, and those running the game are too rich/powerful to stand up against. \n\nThese are my thoughts, i have no clue what OP thinks though",

They dont necessarily need to mean anything, it just improves the odds that they forget one. Jack hoped someone would feel guilty and come back to the house so he could make his getaway. This doesn't explain why he couldn't do it the night she stayed, but maybe he needed it to be during the day or something. My theory is this is some kind of live streamed show for rich people, who are financing it.",

Seems like the weak point is julio. \n\nThings may get a bit serious, but in your position, I'd  take my chances with removing the device, and dealing with julio when that time comes. \n\nYou have no way of knowing the extents that julio will go to to prevent you from leaving. He may be trapped in a sick *game* also. \n\nForget about empathy, do what you need to get out. Even if it's at the expense of the people involved.\n\nWhat is preventing you from calling police? You have the address.\n\nAssuming they've done research on you, maybe witness protection would benefit you, and your family afterwards. (If applicable)",

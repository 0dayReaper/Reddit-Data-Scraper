    "postText": "The house on Halstead Street always unnerved me. Now that I think about it, the word doesn\u2019t do justice. Everyone in town found the house frightening.\n\nThere was a good reason, too. I know better than most; I grew up in the house next door.\n\nI first noticed the house next door when I was six. Until then, I hadn\u2019t ever paid attention. When you\u2019re that young, and your parents have a fence built to keep you from seeing it, you tend not to notice. But then, a storm blew the fence down. My parents were still saving to replace it since money was tight, but they were glad everyone was safe.\n\nThat day, I knew my parents didn\u2019t want me to go past where the fence used to be. But let\u2019s be honest. Was there any real reason for that? It might have been taller, and taller grass is itchy even through long pants, but what could be in the grass, anyway?\n\nWhen I stepped into the grass, I saw a red ball and immediately smiled. I thought I had lost it, as Mom and Dad told me. They always said I must have accidentally left it at McDonald\u2019s or Burger King.\n\nThat got me thinking. If my parents were lying about that, what else were they lying about? It looked like a glorious spot to play.\n\nI walked through the grass even further. I giggled when I saw a raspberry bush. Who\u2019d have thought that was the case? I wasn\u2019t about to pass up the chance to eat some of my favorite berries. I sat down with my ball and started picking.\n\nOut of nowhere, someone grabbed me.\n\n\u201cHarriet!\u201d my mother shrieked.\n\nAlmost reflexively, I screamed.\n\nShe lifted me up and didn\u2019t put me down until I faced her. Then she gripped my head and forced me to look at her.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing? Do you know what could have happened?\u201d\n\nI started crying.\n\n\u201cI was only eating raspberries! And look! I found my ball!\u201d\n\nMom snatched it from me and threw it several yards away. She picked me up and dragged me back home. Once inside, she locked the door and ordered me to my room. I didn\u2019t even get to use the bathroom.\n\n\u201cYou will stay in your room until I come to get you. Do you hear me? If I hear your bedroom door squeak before then, you\u2019ll go to bed without dinner, understood?\u201d\n\nI stood there shaking like a leaf and then nodded. Mom slammed the door and ran down the hallway, leaving me to cry on my bed. When I stopped, I got up and looked out my window. I didn\u2019t understand what was happening. All I did was wander onto the property next door.\n\nThe movement of a tree branch caught my eye\u2014and it was only then that I realized a building was behind it. When I realized it was there, I stared at it. How had I not noticed it?\n\nI spotted the rusted-over vehicles in the overgrown back lot, the ones that, even at that age, I knew would never drive again. I jumped when a gust of wind whistled loudly through the house across from me. My window was closed, and I could still hear it. I could have sworn I heard my name, too.\n\nBefore I knew it, my bedroom door opened. I turned around to find Mom. She wasn\u2019t breathing so heavily anymore, but her eyes still looked tight.\n\n\u201cCome, Harriet. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cMommy, why is that house there?\u201d I asked.\n\nShe saw the outline of the building behind the curtain, and when she realized I could see it if I peeked behind it, she went pale. She leaped to her feet and dragged me to my bed.\n\n\u201cYou are not to go anywhere near that building, young lady. You hear me?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why not?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you hear me?\u201d\n\nI agreed because I was not getting any answers. The next day, the fence was back up, and my mother moved my room.\n\nThat didn\u2019t keep the tears from stinging my eyes. I might have been a child, but children aren\u2019t stupid. I tried asking Mom about the house in the next few days. But she refused to say anything, even pretending she didn\u2019t hear me. I\u2019d have to wait for Dad to return from his business trip. Dad could give me answers once he got home; he always listened better.\n\nDad and I sat in the living room while Mom went to the grocery store. I sat there, telling Dad everything about what happened.\n\n\u201cDid you hear any strange noises coming from the house next door?\u201d Dad asked.\n\n\u201cLike what? The wind whistling around in it?\u201d\n\nDad went pale.\n\n\u201cThe wind whistling?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. I was in my room looking at it when the wind picked up. I heard it clear as day, Dad.\u201d\n\nHe rushed to his phone and called Mom. Then, he told me something that made no sense. That day, there was no wind. It was almost entirely still.\n\nWhat did he mean there wasn\u2019t any wind that day? I heard it. But then he showed me the weather reports\u2014and they confirmed there was no wind. As I got to thinking, he was right. I didn\u2019t feel any wind when I was by that raspberry bush.\n\nWe jumped when we heard the wind whistling as if through a long-abandoned house. We looked back at the local weather report. There was no wind that day, either.\n\nTwo weeks later, I celebrated my seventh birthday. A lovely day that you can expect from a child\u2019s birthday party. My parents even hired a bouncy castle for us kids.\n\nThen, a woman appeared. I was the first to see her walking up the driveway, and I didn\u2019t see a matching car. She reminded me of the financial adviser my parents sometimes visited.\n\n\u201cMom, who\u2019s that?\u201d I asked.\n\nAs soon as I pointed her out, Mom went pale.\n\n\u201cHarriet, go inside,\u201d she ordered.\n\nI didn\u2019t know why nobody made the other children go inside, but I didn\u2019t argue. The conversation outside was already getting heated. A few children cried because of how loud it got.\n\n\u201cLet her back outside! You can\u2019t keep her from me!\u201d the woman yelled.\n\n\u201cGet off my property! Now!\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t catch the end as Dad pulled me from the window, but I remember someone calling the police. By the time the police arrived, however, the woman had vanished.\n\nWhen people realized she had vanished, people looked around. My best friend\u2019s father had called the police\u2014and he had only called them a few minutes before. She couldn\u2019t have gotten away that quickly with so many witnesses.\n\nNeither of my parents ever figured out how that took place. I\u2019m not sure what first clued them in about her, but it wasn\u2019t the last time I would see her.\n\nThe next time I encountered the woman, I was ten years old. By then, I had forgotten about her. This time, she tried getting into my school by claiming she was my aunt. When the principal called me to the office, I looked at my teacher, confused. My aunt lived in Seattle. When I asked why my parents hadn\u2019t told me she was visiting, it made them call my mother. She confirmed my aunt wasn\u2019t in town, prompting school officials to call the police.\n\nI returned to class but not fast enough to see the woman having a tantrum. My mother later said she had disappeared before the police arrived.\n\nI remembered the house on Halstead Street, too. By then, I realized what was happening. At least two children vanished after visiting it. I still remember the one mother sobbing in her husband\u2019s arms as reporters asked her questions. She wasn\u2019t prepared for them to bombard her with so many, and they wouldn\u2019t let up.\n\nMy parents didn\u2019t like it when I watched the news with them, but they didn\u2019t stop me. They were never the sort to hide me from what happened in the world\u2014and this was no different. I squirmed when I saw just how many questions all those journalists threw at the surviving parents.\n\nAs I watched the news with them, however, I noticed something.\n\n\u201cMom? Dad? Isn\u2019t that the woman who was at my birthday party?\u201d\n\nI pointed her out, and they gasped.\n\nAnd the more I passed by that house, the more I felt like it was staring at me with eyes of hunger. That\u2019s how the two front windows looked, the caved-in porch reminding me of a mouth. By then, I understood why Mom told me not to go near the house on Halstead Street.\n\nWhen I was twelve, the next child to disappear was a three-year-old autistic boy named Nathaniel.\n\nNow that I think about it, it makes sense that he vanished like that. I\u2019m autistic myself, but I\u2019m very much high functioning. People had known me for years and were stunned when I disclosed it.\n\nNathaniel, however, was severe. He wouldn\u2019t make eye contact, never responded to his name, and got violent when someone told him no. I never thought a three-year-old could make people wonder if his father was beating his mother, but you learn something new every day. I talked to the parents while they were moving in. They knew their previous town\u2019s police well.\n\nIn that respect, I couldn\u2019t help but have sympathy. There was a lot Nathaniel put them through. They moved into town because they needed to be closer to his therapists.\n\nMy heart sank when I saw Nathaniel see the house on Halstead Street. He didn\u2019t just see it; he was staring at it. Throughout the time his parents were moving them into the house, he didn\u2019t budge. How his parents didn\u2019t notice sooner, I still don\u2019t understand. I think they were just glad he was quiet.\n\nBut then, after the movers placed the last of their furniture inside their new house, the boy\u2019s mother came to fetch him. She picked him up.\n\nAs soon as she did, the boy shrieked. He screamed so loudly I didn\u2019t know how he didn\u2019t pass out. He cried harder as she dragged him inside the house and closed the door.\n\nAs the boy\u2019s ear-piercing screams continued, my parents joined me in watching. At one point, the boy kicked a window.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cHey! Not in front of our daughter,\u201d Dad scolded.\n\n\u201cMy point still stands, honey. It sounds like someone\u2019s beating him.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, police cars arrived. Someone called the police\u2014and they had to force the door open.\n\nWhen they did, the boy bolted right out the door. Nobody could react before he ran across the street to the abandoned building. A car even had to halt. Within seconds, the boy reached the front yard.\n\nFinally, the police caught up with him and picked him up. All the while, he kept screaming. My parents and I saw his face\u2014he was redder than ketchup.\n\n\u201cI hope those cops do their jobs and warn the parents,\u201d Dad muttered. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that\u2019s ending well.\u201d\n\nEventually, Nathaniel stopped, but that didn\u2019t mean it was over. That was the first time the boy bolted from his parents to the house on Halstead Street.\n\nThe boy bolted seven more times after moving in. He didn\u2019t always make it across the street. His parents built the fence around their yard higher, but he got up and over it. Once, he got caught in it and cut himself. Whenever someone grabbed him, he screamed and cried. It surprised me no one called CPS.\n\nSix weeks later, the inevitable came. The boy\u2019s mother was bathing when he got away from the nanny. They called the police, but it was too late. Nathaniel had run to the house and vanished.\n\nThis time, nobody mentioned it. When I asked Nathaniel\u2019s parents about their son, they looked at me like I was crazy. My parents and I couldn\u2019t figure out why. Yet the parents insisted they didn\u2019t know what we were talking about, claiming I was the first autistic person they\u2019d met. It didn\u2019t help that the media never mentioned his disappearance.\n\nMom and Dad had a few hushed conversations and finally stopped. Mom pulled me aside, her face pale and unblinking. That was all it took to realize she was serious\u2014and I was about to get answers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason I don\u2019t let you go near that house, Harriet. Now that you\u2019re twelve, I think you\u2019re old enough to know why.\u201d\n\nThat was an understatement, but I said nothing. Instead, I just sat there listening.\n\nThe abandoned house had always been there, as far as anyone knew. Even Mom did\u2014and she grew up in the same town as me, although not on the same street. It had been abandoned since at least the 1930s, but further back, nobody knew when it was built.\n\n\u201cThat explains those old cars,\u201d I muttered.\n\nMom nodded.\n\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t keep people from trying to renovate it. The first attempt at renovation we know about happened in 1946.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t end well. Nobody knows what drove them out, as they never revealed what they experienced. All anyone knows is that they skipped town and let the bank repossess it. They didn\u2019t even make it to the three-month anniversary before abandoning it.\n\nThe next verified owners came along in 1954. Those owners abandoned it only three weeks later, with the bank repossessing it and selling it three months later, only for the same thing to occur again.\n\n\u201cDid anyone ever tell them there are easier ways to ruin their finances?\u201d\n\nMom laughed at my halfhearted joke.\n\n\u201cMakes you wonder, right?\u201d Mom acknowledged. \u201cBut that proved to be another thing. Many people who tried renovating it died soon after. Their children often had to pay off remaining debts.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid anyone tell what they experienced?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome were happy to do so, but not all of them.\u201d\n\nBy then, Mom started squirming. She fidgeted throughout the entire recounting, but I noticed it picking up. I said nothing, though\u2014and kept listening.\n\nThe pattern of buying the house only to be driven out a few weeks later for the bank to repossess it continued throughout the years. There was a slowdown in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. All three families in the 1990s to buy it sold their stories so they could recoup some of their losses.\n\nThen came the last family to live there. The history didn\u2019t put them off; that was part of the appeal. If only they knew they\u2019d leave like everyone else.\n\n\u201cThey lasted the longest, though. Unlike others, they kept up payments on the house. They couldn\u2019t afford to abandon it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did they see?\u201d\n\nMom stiffened, almost not wanting to recall.\n\n\u201cA person appeared in their house. They thought they recognized the person\u2014and after digging, they realized who it was.\u201d\n\nMom slid me a photograph. It was black-and-white, but I still recognized the person as the woman who showed up at my birthday party that day\u2014and refused to pick up the photo because of that.\n\n\u201cThe story doesn\u2019t end there. It was strange because the woman hadn\u2019t aged, and that woman hadn\u2019t been the only one they saw.\u201d\n\nThat was only the first person, and the other owners soon followed.\n\n\u201cSoon after that, they fled the house.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, Mom stopped, giving me a pointed look. When the realization set in, my mouth went dry. She was talking about herself and Dad. They were the last to buy the house on Halstead Street.\n\nI decided against asking anything further. From the look on Mom\u2019s face, she didn\u2019t want to recall what happened there. I felt terrible about pressing her for details when I was younger.\n\nAs the years passed, more people disappeared. The media claimed they skipped town. I knew they didn\u2019t\u2014as Mom, a private detective, found their death certificates at some point. It was still bizarre how many people endured so much because of one house.\n\nI saw that woman who first bought the house around town every so often, too. Whenever I saw her, I looked away and went about my business as if I didn\u2019t see her. I didn\u2019t even react when I heard the distant tantrum I no doubt knew she was throwing.\n\nThree years after I completed graduate school, Mom died in a six-car pileup with an oil tanker. Mom died on impact, so at least she didn\u2019t suffer when the tanker exploded.\n\nMy husband, Eli, joined Dad and me to sort through everything. Her estate was massive, which Dad and I saw coming. Grandpa was already a widower when I was born, and he left everything he had to Mom, Dad, and my two aunts. When Mom died, she left everything to Dad and me.\n\nThe estate still needed to be administered through the probate courts, which would take a while. All we could do was sort through the contents of the house. It was bittersweet\u2014and not just for Dad or me. Eli and my mother liked each other. I still have no clue what he saw in me to make him think I was worth it, but evidently, I had done something right.\n\nDad, Eli, and I were sorting through some things in the attic one day. Much of it was dusty and reeked of mildew, but most belonged to Mom. The attic needed to be emptied, anyway. We got everything out and dusted off, and after taking a few moments to stop coughing, we started sorting through it.\n\nMuch of it was interesting\u2014Dad was too eager to tell us the stories. He told us about when he and Mom almost slammed into a moose on their honeymoon in Newfoundland many times, but we didn\u2019t care. We didn\u2019t even care when he told us again about going on vacation, a bridezilla, and her wedding almost setting the hotel on fire. Stories like that are for a lifetime.\n\nBut then we got to a box labeled Old House. I opened it up, and I immediately coughed. I didn\u2019t expect so much dust, and that\u2019s saying something, given everything we already sorted through. Dad and Eli did so, too. And after a few moments, we finally got past it and looked through the contents.\n\nAs soon as I saw the first photo, I paused. That was Mom, for sure\u2014and Dad next to her. They looked a lot younger, but then I saw the background.\n\nThey were standing in front of the house on Halstead Street. The conversation that day between Mom and me flooded back.\n\nDad took the photo from me. I jumped, not realizing he noticed me staring at the picture.\n\n\u201cShe never wanted to tell you about that. She didn\u2019t want to tell you we still own it.\u201d\n\nEli and I stared at him for a moment.\n\n\u201cWhy not? Harriet already told me about the property\u2019s history.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe trauma of the experience frightened her too badly. It took everything she had to tell her we once lived there.\u201d\n\nEli and I stared at him, hoping he\u2019d tell us what they had experienced. But he said nothing.\n\n\u201cRead some of the diary entries in that box. That will give you an idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill they also tell us why you and Mom never gave it up?\u201d\n\nDad nodded, and then he walked out of the dining room. Eli and I looked at each other and sat down. We took everything out of the box and spotted the journals. We opened up the oldest and read.\n\nThe first entries were what we were expecting. Eli himself made a living flipping houses. It was a good living even whenever we thought about the 2007-2008 housing crisis.\n\n\u201cI still remember how well the first house sold after the Great Recession,\u201d Eli muttered. \u201cI know all too well the emotions running through their minds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey probably had more hopes, too. From the looks of it, this was before then.\u201d\n\nEli chuckled, and we kept reading.\n\nThings changed when the entries reached June.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Eli muttered. \u201cFace in the mirror?\u201d\n\nWe glanced at each other.\n\n\u201cAnd not just any face,\u201d I noted as I sorted through Mom\u2019s old research papers. \u201cThat sounds like someone who once owned it in the past.\u201d\n\nIt turned out I was right. Mom\u2019s research proved it. But what we saw in the journal made little sense. The man Mom saw in that mirror was alive at the time. We started to form a timeline in our heads. The man she talked to had given her his business card. It was right there in the box with his face on it.\n\nAs the entries in the first journal went on, events in the house became more and more disturbing\u2014from random fires and moving objects to sudden psychic powers and voices coming from the walls. The walls told them things, even telling them when they would get pregnant.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think my parents wanted anyone else to endure what they did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a good thing for them,\u201d Eli replied. \u201cLook at this.\u201d\n\nI recognized the photo right away. It was a photo of me on my seventh birthday. It was right before that woman showed up\u2014and she appeared in it. Even from a distance, the skull face was apparent. As the realization set in, my skin tingled. What did she intend with me that day at my birthday party?\n\nA loud bang made us jump.\n\n\u201cGet out!\u201d Dad roared.\n\n\u201cHoney,\u201d a woman\u2019s voice implored. Stomach acid lurched into my mouth\u2014and it looked like the same happened to Eli.\n\nThat was Mom\u2019s voice.\n\nThree more gunshots went off, causing me and Eli to rush into the foyer. Mom was lying on the floor, blood pooling underneath her. Dad stood at the other end. We all stared at the body, the hall so silent I could have heard a pin drop. All the while, the skin seemed to get thinner and thinner. We saw the bones, even parts of the skull.\n\nThen, the body and the blood vanished. With that, the foyer returned to normal. The only signs that anything had happened were the bullet holes in the door frame.\n\nI looked at Dad.\n\n\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d I demanded.\n\nHe gulped for some air before speaking.\n\n\u201cHow far did you get in the journals?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust finished the first one,\u201d Eli replied.\n\nDad took a breath and sighed.\n\n\u201cMaybe I should tell you what happened next. It\u2019s better coming from me, anyway.\u201d\n\nDad motioned for Eli and me to follow him\u2014and we all sat at the dining room table. The contents of that box were still on the other end, and Dad grabbed the two remaining journals before sitting down. All the while, he was arching his neck, sweat oozing down his forehead. It was like he recalled something he wasn\u2019t keen on remembering.\n\nEli and I watched as Dad flipped through the two small notebooks, and it took a while for anyone to say anything.\n\n\u201cHow were you able to see the faces, Dad? I already checked Mom\u2019s research. I\u2019m pretty sure that was someone who once owned that house.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the same conclusion I came to.\u201d\n\nHe sighed, put the two journals down, and then looked at us.\n\n\u201cWe had been in that house next door for six months when we found out your mother was pregnant with you. That\u2019s obvious from the journal you just read.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened after that?\u201d Eli asked.\n\n\u201cWe stayed in that house for three more months after that\u2014and the events of that time take up the rest of those notebooks. That was when the walls started talking to us.\u201d\n\nEli and I stared at him, not even knowing what to say. He kept talking.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t realize it was the walls talking at first. By then, we were badly sleep-deprived and falling asleep at weird times. We thought we were hallucinating.\u201d\n\n\u201cHallucinations?\u201d I muttered. \u201cLike what? The walls talking?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was just one example. We dismissed it, of course. Everyone knows walls can\u2019t talk. By then, the renovation cost was taking its toll on both of us.\u201d\n\nBut they weren\u2019t. Mom\u2019s father stopped by one day. Mom, Dad, and Grandpa all knew my parents were struggling. But when he ran from the house on Halstead Street after hearing an announcement that his wife would die in two days, nobody could deny what was happening.\n\n\u201cSure enough, your grandmother died two days later from a heart attack.\u201d\n\nThe will gave Mom and Dad enough time to pay off their debts and move into the house next door, where I grew up. They refused to sell it, but whatever was in that house wasn\u2019t happy. That was the first time they heard the whistling around the house next door. They could have sworn they heard a woman and child wailing when they first heard it.\n\n\u201cWhen the wind picked up, we checked the weather reports. There was no wind that day.\u201d\n\nAs soon as he said that, my mouth went dry. It was just like when I heard it whistling around that day when I was six.\n\n\u201cYour mother set foot back onto that property of her own accord only once after that,\u201d Dad said. \u201cAnd it was just before you were born.\u201d\n\nShe ran out of the building when she heard the voice of a young boy.\n\n\u201cYou are mine!\u201d\n\nShe stopped dead in her tracks as she ran out of the house. She saw the same woman that arrived to see me that day\u2014the woman confirmed to be the first to buy it. The autistic boy who vanished was next to the woman. They stood there, their eyes boring into her.\n\nMom bolted. She didn\u2019t stop until she returned home, then slammed the door behind her and locked it. She couldn\u2019t stand up for a while, not wanting to face what she had seen.\n\nBut then a pounding on the door made it shake, making Mom jump.\n\n\u201cGive her to us!\u201d a pair of voices boomed. It seemed to have come from all sides and was loud enough to make her ears ring.\n\nFor a moment, she didn\u2019t move, but then it happened again.\n\n\u201cGive her to us!\u201d\n\nThe door rattled as they chanted. Mom glanced at the table drawer in the front hall where she and Dad kept a pistol. She grabbed the gun\u2014and, after making sure it was loaded, she yanked the door open.\n\nAs expected, the woman and the child stood there, their eyes glowing metallic black. The sound of their demands pulsed through Mom\u2019s skull so severely she thought it would explode. She already felt nausea, and starbursts were going off.\n\nShe raised the gun and pulled the trigger.\n\nAs soon as the bullets went through their bodies, the changing stopped. The bodies collapsed, their skulls cracking from the impact on the porch.\n\n\u201cAfter that, she called me and told me what happened. After you were born, she swore you would never enter that house yourself.\u201d\n\nI nodded grimly, remembering the day she grabbed me off the lawn.\n\nWe all jumped when we heard the sudden sound of the wind whistling.\n\n\u201cGive her to us!\u201d\n\nIt picked up for a moment, and then it finally died down. We glanced at each other, and none of us needed to say a word to realize what needed to happen.\n\nThe next day, we called the local town hall asking how to declare the house on Halstead Street an attractive nuisance. It took a few hoops, but we got it done.\n\nThroughout the process, town administrators were smiling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d one of them said. \u201cI\u2019m surprised it didn\u2019t happen sooner.\u201d\n\nWell, that was the understatement of the century. When we got approval from the town board, Dad, Eli, and I cracked open a bottle of champagne. We even drank cocktails while watching the building torn down.\n\nWe talked to the people hired to tear it down afterward, and they told us they could have sworn they heard children screaming and wailing. They pressed on, thinking it was their imagination.\n\nDad sold the land it once stood on to the town. Then, he sold my childhood home, and we moved to another part of the state.\n\nEli and I have three children now. Eli still flips houses but has also become a real estate agent. He sold several luxury homes, which was a relief because it meant a solid income. I\u2019m a financial advisor. I still don\u2019t know how we got this lucky with how the economy is. Sometimes, I wonder if something happened long ago to make this all the case.\n\nMy gut tells me this will happen again, though. Eli came home recently, his face pale.\n\nAs soon as I saw him, I stood up and made eye contact. I didn\u2019t even need to ask.\n\n\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d he muttered as he collapsed in the chair beside me.\n\nI stared at him, and then he looked at me.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with the house I just sold. There\u2019s no history anyone could find. I could have sworn I heard the wind whistling around in it\u2014and there weren\u2019t any children, but I could have sworn I heard a child giggling in the house.\u201d",

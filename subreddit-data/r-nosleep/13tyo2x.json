    "postText": "I live in a suburb surrounded by forest. My house is in a row of other properties built next to a tree line. The neighborhood was always quiet. The sounds of crickets, birds, and sight of black bears were routine on most summer days. \n\nThe scenic area was something I was always grateful for. I lived completely alone since the death of my parents. An accidental fire took both of their lives. Once I collected my inheritance, I relocated to a much more peaceful region. I had always fantasized about moving there.\n\nI tried to start a relationship with Samantha. I had gone to High School with her sixteen years before. She had gone on to become a respected Detective. My attempt at something long lasting with her failed. She was too career oriented. I was reeling from grief. Focusing on building something meaningful with her was a pipe dream.\n\nThings around my community changed once the Murphy family went missing. \n\nThe first sign that something was off on that Wednesday was how their blinds had closed. Their silver Chrysler remained parked in the driveway. \n\nA tennis instructor at the country club noticed the wife of that house did not show up for the program. He called their number to make sure everything was alright. When no one responded, he notified the authorities. Rumors abounded immediately among the home owners association about an alleged affair. The gossip only furthered when the married couple and their three kids were not found in the abode.\n\nI watched from my balcony as the patrolmen roped the place off with caution tape. The domicile was a three story building with brick chimney\u2019s and a few peaked roofs in the style of English towers. They were beige, light blue and crimson. \n\nOn the morning of the Murphy\u2019s desertion of society, the architecture became a hollow image. It was one that was once filled with activity and life.\n\nThe law did what they could. Any success they may have had in the investigation was secret. A few months passed by and they removed the caution tape.\n\nI followed the on-line police logs. The weather was pristine and clear the day they vanished. The fact that there were no witnesses to what direction they may have gone disturbed me.\n\nI had heard how the man, Frank Murphy, had a bit of a temper and always had a bourbon in hand. I had heard mutual friends describe him as an alcoholic in denial of his servitude to liquor. He was an indignant individual who knew no true repercussions for his behavior. He always had bail money from a software company he founded and sold a long time ago. \n\nI was never close to that family, but I peered out at their vacant house far more than I ever had. I was in need of an answer. What could have happened?\n\n*\n\nI called Samantha one evening as I sat on my bed, wondering how she would respond to my reaching out. We were never argumentative or on bad terms. I still worried about her reaction, and hoped it would not be a dismissive one. \n\nI heard her say hello. Her voice still impressed me. I had almost forgotten how silky her tone was. I knew it could change to a much firmer pitch when she was interviewing a suspect.\n\n\u201cHi, Sam. I\u2019d like to know if you\u2019d be free tomorrow for a cup of coffee. We can go to that place, The Bean Field, off Pond road. It\u2019s been a while and I know you have a lot to tell me about what\u2019s new in your life.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause on the other end, and for a second a bout of anxiety hit me. I judged my own words as robotic, stilted, and sure to push her away. I reasoned she was summoning an excuse to get out of having to interact with me.  How dare I presume she would even entertain the notion of having a meeting.\n\n\u201cThat sounds great,\u201d she said. \u201cTomorrow is my day off, luckily for you. I\u2019m in the middle of an incident right now. It\u2019s a five car pile-up about forty minutes from where you live. I\u2019ve gotta run. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWhen she hung up, I was triumphant. I looked at our old text conversations.  I realized we had not been in communication with each other for over twelve months. Now was my opportunity to reconcile that gap of unintended avoidance. I knew it would be an undeserved opportunity.\n\n*\n\nI sat outside of the cafe the next morning at a black metal table. I had a view of rolling hills dotted with trees. A highway with multitudinous shrubberies sat on either side of it. I sipped a piccolo latte while waiting for her. \n\nWhen she arrived and stepped out of her hatchback in the parking lot, her appearance floored me. She had not dressed up for our supposed date, but that did not make a difference. She had arrived from the gym and wore shorts and a top set. She donned a gray and green hoodie.\n\nShe sat across from me and reached for the menu.\n\n\u201cCan you go to the front and order me avocado toast?\u201d Samantha asked. \u201cI\u2019ll also take a mocha with a few shots of espresso. Please.\u201d\n\nI did exactly that. When I returned with her items, she apologized for consuming her meal in less than two minutes.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t eaten since five PM yesterday,\u201d she said between sips.\n\n\u201cI understand,\u201d I said. \u201cI doubt you ever have a consistent schedule anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, but that\u2019s why I have to enjoy my free time when I can.\u201d\n\nWe settled into talking about what had happened since we last saw each other. I referenced my trying to learn another language (French) with the hopes of moving to Europe or Canada. \n\nAfter fifteen minutes of small talk, I asked her about work, but I did so with caution. It started with me wondering about what the call she was on when we were on the phone was about. \n\n\u201cA drunk driver blew a stop sign and hit two other vehicles,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was ugly. A few people died. We\u2019ll see if the man in silk pajamas gives him the proper sentence or a traffic citation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m curious about what happened to the Murphy\u2019s, if they\u2019re hurt or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and everyone else,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been getting so many witness accounts, and so far they\u2019ve all been bogus. All I know is what I saw when I got there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were one of the responders,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYeah. Something about the place was off from the moment I walked in. I found heavy items in placed they should not have been in. The toolbox was not in the garage but on the second story. A disassembled snowblower lay scattered everywhere in pieces. The oven door was on their bed. Frank Murphy was not the strongest guy in the world, either. For him to cause the kind of property damage I saw doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. At the risk of sounding crazy, inexplicable things happened when I was there.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was under the impression that something was playing a trick on me. Electrical outlets sparked a few times out of nowhere. The ceiling fan would go from still to spinning when I looked up at it. Books would fall off of the shelves. A volume on black magic, of all things, almost hit the top of my head when I walked on by. Another book about fairies collapsed with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the home intruder set up a bunch of weird diversions,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of that before. These killers or kidnappers want the victims to think there was more than one of them.  It\u2019s so their account\u2019s disputed in court.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll tell you right now,\u201d she said, \u201cwe didn\u2019t find any outside DNA.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s a case of family annihilation,\u201d I said as I took a long swig of my beverage. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can substantiate the facts, but a few people have said that Emily had a big life insurance policy. Frank knew about. He may have been using steroids and having an affair, and that could have contributed to-\u201c\n\nIt occurred to me that she eyed me with suspicion, as though I was digging too deep. I could also tell she regretted letting information about the forensic results slip.\n\nShe stood up and stared at me with a flash of anger in her eyes. \n\n\u201cI thought you wanted to piece something back together with me,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you wanted to play armchair investigator like every true crime fan. You know, your parents were kind. I wish you\u2019d follow their example. I\u2019ll let you get the bill.\u201d\n\nShe walked back to her vehicle and I knew it would be a while before we conversed again.\n\nLater that night, I stared out my window at the Murphy home. I saw a star shoot across the sky, and it almost seemed ready to plummet into the side of their house.\n\n*\n\nThe next evening, I took a walk around the suburb. I spotted a thin line of dried red fluid along a path which led into the woods.\n\nI was attempting to get in some movement to get my mind off of the events of the day before. Negativity and self-deprecation were all-consuming. I felt the need for a long saunter to try and release some of the meandering and pessimistic energy I accrued.\n\nWhen I saw the carmine ribbon along the dark soil, a sense of worry filled me. I was not that far removed from a cul-de-sac with palatial manors a block away. There was no way I could speculate on me being the first to see it. \n\nCould it be a hint where they are? I thought.\n\nThe notion seemed absurd, a reach. \n\nI had read in the local newspaper that there was an uptick in bobcat sightings due to recent wildfires. The animals relocated during prior summers. I reasoned it could have been a house pet which became a victim after it got snatched away into the overgrowth.\n\nI followed it, and the uneven road of red stretched on past many bushes and over logs. A shrill chirping in the background became louder. I moved between two conifers with petrified wood and found myself in a part of the forest I had never been in.\n\nThere were so many branches that it blacked out the falling sun. Ahead of me was a clearing. A swarm of gnats and mosquitos descended upon it. The sea of insects soared together in chaotic unison as a wave among the sedges and lichen.\n\nI looked towards the right of the meadow and saw a ramshackle tree house. I trailed the red line towards it. I peered in through one of the windows and saw a statue of a woman with wings. I knew she was not an angel. There was no halo, nor were her organs of flight feathery, but rather they were thin and bat-like.\n\nI entered the place knowing the danger I was putting myself in. I had tracked mud in and was oblivious to the incriminating actions I partook in. I was trespassing and risking stumbling into whoever may have owned the land. My curiosity got the better of me and caused me to keep moving forward.\n\nThe room was sparse but decorated. The walls had carvings of men and women, also with wings.  Their bodies held yogic-like positions as they reached out to one another mid-air. \n\nA piece of parchment with a few words sat in the corner. I picked it up and read it:\n\n\u2018Humans are the greatest living beings to play tricks on. Especially when they go through a time of drought and extreme cold.\u2019\n\nI sat it down where I found it, unsure of what to make of it.\n\nI touched the central figure\u2019s neck. The chiseling was not only cold, but below freezing, as though I had submerged my hand in a polar pool.\n\nThe noise of some kind of bird attempting to escape a confined space reverberated below me.\n\nSomething brushed against my leg. I looked down and saw an army of glow bugs float up between the cracks, and they circled around me. They were like dragon flies. At the time I had labeled them as such, but in reality their shapes were far too humanoid.\n\nI walked back home. I went to bed and slept. I was still perturbed at the wine-colored avenue and cabin.\n\nI awoke in the middle of the night after something tapped at my walls from the outside. I peered out and saw the Murphy home, and observed how the blinds over their casements were wide open. A hive of mites filled every inch of the interior.\n\n*\n\nI found the decomposing body of a chipmunk stuffed into the tailpipe of my vehicle the next day.\n\nThis horrified me, because the deliberation of the act was too evident to ignore. While I did have a surveillance camera on my porch, the coverage of my vehicle was non-existent. I calmed myself down by thinking it was likely a tempestuous child. I retrieved a pair of medical gloves and disposed of the creature before going on with the errand. The rotting body had a horrible smell.  It was like an onion left out in humidity for days, and my stomach turned as I sealed it off in the garbage with the lid.\n\nThe next morning, I looked in my closet. Some of my favorite shirts had disintegrated. Holes and patches of destroyed fabric littered them. I found it odd, and even searched on-line for possible answers before I decided it had to be a moth infestation. I sprayed lavender. Information on a website statEd that was a cure-all, but the problem persisted. It bothered me that I had not seen a single aphid, but I pushed that concern away.\n\nA few days afterward, when I had tossed my disheveled pieces of attire, the power in my house went out. This was not such an unusual occurrence during the heavy winter months. For it to occur in the summer was strange. \n\nIt was a rolling blackout. Once my house had electricity again, I noticed how someone moved items around. \n\nSomething turned my kitchen table on its side and stuffed into a part of the kitchen I would have never placed it in.\n\nI grabbed a butcher knife and did a sweep of the premises, and I did not find anything. There were no footprints or signs of anything else tampered with. When I got to the second story, birds nested along the tree tops, and the repugnant odor of fish attacked me.\n\nMy allergies became insufferable over the next month. Nothing purchased over the counter which helped it.\n\n*\n\nI went to the beach on an overcast day. After roughly half a mile of walking, I saw an illustration someone had drawn in the sand with a stick. It was of a being with airfoils. \n\nA light precipitation had fallen earlier. As I trailed along the former part of the sand, a glint in the corner of my eye caught my attention. I looked out at the water and saw what appeared to be a light blue outline of wings beneath the surface.  \n\nA phosphorescent wall of creatures surrounded me. \n\nAs the days march  on, I know I am stalked by something I cannot rebel against, let alone have any agency or autonomy over. My pillowcases have shredded, the pipes in my basement have burst, and someone left me a gift at my front door. When I opened it, I saw mice scurry away. It was a book, and it was one about the history of fairies.\n\nI picked it up and had to blow the dust off of it. Someone had stolen it from a musty subterranean chamber and brought it here. \n\nI theorized that it was Samantha, passive aggressive with her disappointment in me. Yet I flip through its pages and find it all too familiar. I cannot help but wonder if this is a sign of something far more dangerous.",

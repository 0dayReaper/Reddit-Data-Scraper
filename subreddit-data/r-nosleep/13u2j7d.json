    "postText": "It started with a joke. I was at a party, and someone told a funny story. I laughed, and then I couldn't stop smiling. It was like my face was stuck in a permanent grin. At first, it was kind of funny. People would ask me why I was smiling all the time, and I would just shrug and say that I was happy. But then, it started to become a problem. I couldn't sleep at night because my face was hurting from all the smiling. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. It was like my face had a mind of its own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to see a doctor, but they couldn't find anything wrong with me. They said it was just a nervous tic, and that it would go away on its own. But it didn't. It got worse. I started to avoid social situations because I didn't want people to think I was crazy. But then, something even worse happened. I started to see things. Terrible things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was walking down the street one day, and I saw a woman with her face contorted into a grotesque grin. She stared at me with her dead eyes, her mouth stretched into an impossible smile. I thought I was going insane. But then, I realized that it wasn't just me. Everyone around me was smiling. But it wasn't a happy smile. It was a twisted, evil smile. It was like my own grin had infected the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to run, but everywhere I went, people were smiling. Even the animals were grinning at me. It was like I was trapped in a nightmare. I don't know how long I've been like this. Days, weeks, months? Time doesn't seem to matter anymore. All that matters is the smiling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've tried everything to stop it. I've tried to break my own jaw, but it won't budge. I've tried to cut the corners of my mouth, but they just keep stretching. I've even tried to kill myself, but I can't. My body won't let me. It's like my own smile is protecting me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure what's going to happen to me. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to break free from this curse. But I do know one thing. I'm not alone. There are others like me. I've seen them on the streets, their faces twisted into those same terrible grins. We don't talk to each other. We don't make eye contact but I they are stuck in the same terrible torment. My face is hiring even more and my lips have started to bleed from the gargantuan grin plastered on my face. I don\u2019t know how long I can stare at myself in the mirror trying to stop it. It hurts please send help to me. My face is getting worse the smile widens every second my eyes are sore from staring I don\u2019t look human anymore I don\u2019t look happy. Children run from me, Parents hide children. A voice in my head is telling me to be happy. It\u2019s on constant repeat. Be happy. Be happy. Be happy. Join me. Be happy.",

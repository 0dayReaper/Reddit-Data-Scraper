    "postText": "One hundred and forty-nine stairs. That\u2019s how many there are to get up to the fire tower I\u2019m posted at. I used to think getting up there meant safety. Now, I\u2019m hoping it just means survival.\r  \nClimbing one hundred and forty-nine steps when you\u2019re healthy is no small feat. When one of your legs has been torn to shreds, you\u2019re bleeding from many places and you\u2019re trying to get up there to wrap it, hoping there\u2019s enough bandages so you don\u2019t bleed to death, it\u2019s a lot more difficult.\r  \nThen there are the stairs themselves which also count as a hazard when you have to hop up each one, causing pain to shoot through your injured leg. The stairs are skinny enough as they are, but the closer you get to the top, the smaller they get. \r  \nHow do I know the exact number of steps? I counted them. I also counted which ones I miscalculated my jump, or brushed my foot against the step, or did something else that nearly sent me sailing over the rickety railing to my untimely death. The first time was one step number three, then fifteen, thirty-seven was a bad one, fifty-two, one oh seven, one-twenty, and finally one-forty-three. I guess it\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m deathly afraid of heights.\r  \nBy now you may have figured out, I\u2019m a park ranger. How did I end up playing this deadly game of hopscotch? It started a week ago when I got the job. \r  \nI was super excited, because I love working alone, and I love nature. What other job blends those two so well?\r  \nThat excitement waned quite a bit when I arrived at the tower on my first day and looked up at those tiny metal steps I would have to climb to get to my job. The whole thing looked about as sturdy as if someone had built it with an erector set. I mean honestly, seeing surface rust on stairs that have to support your weight is terrifying, and I had to wonder how much I would be swaying when the wind really kicked up. \r  \nI wanted to close my eyes and just run up, but I didn\u2019t dare. I paid attention to every single step, watching the metal bow under the weight of my foot, white-knuckling the railings as I went.\r  \nFinally, I reached the top and knocked on the trapdoor that had to be opened to let me in. I met the ranger who would be training me. His name was Bob, and he looked every bit how I envision a park ranger would look. Tall and thin, wiry but not scrawny, with a five o\u2019clock shadow because he never had the time to shave properly. \r  \nBob was one of those guys who seemed to always have a smirk on their face like they\u2019ve just been told the greatest joke of all time, but they don\u2019t want to let you in on it.\r  \nHe spent the entire shift showing me around and then boring me to tears with all the little details of working in a fire tower. The place wasn\u2019t bad. I was expecting an empty room with a card table and a radio, but this was nice. It reminded me of a small apartment or the inside of a small RV. There was a kitchenette with a microwave, sink, and minifridge. There was a couch and a couple of chairs, and most importantly, there was a bathroom. \r  \nAt one point I thought there would be an outhouse at the base of the tower I would have to use. The thought of going down all those steps while holding number one or especially number two was something I didn\u2019t even want to have nightmares about. \r  \nJust before the end of the shift, the next ranger came up. His name was Toby. \r  \nToby looked nothing like I envisioned rangers looking like. He was overweight but made up for it by being under tall. He had a look of mischief in his eyes like a seventh grader who had just dropped a cherry bomb down the toilet and was trying to walk away looking nonchalant.\r  \nHe smiled and shook my hand.\r  \n\u201cSo did Bob bore you to tears?\u201d he said.\r  \n\u201cNot quite to tears,\u201d I said.\r  \n\u201cHey, I\u2019m a good trainer,\u201d Bob said looking offended yet still wearing that grin.\r  \n\u201cDid you tell him everything?\u201d Toby said.\r  \n\u201cPretty sure,\u201d Bob said.\r  \n\u201cDid you tell him about?\u201d Toby leaned closer and whispered something in Bob\u2019s ear that I couldn\u2019t hear.\r  \nBob\u2019s grin grew.\r  \n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t tell him about that.\u201d\r  \n\u201cMaybe we should wait until he\u2019s done training,\u201d Toby said.\r  \n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said looking back and forth between them.\r  \n\u201cWe\u2019ll tell you once you\u2019re done job shadowing,\u201d Bob said with that infuriating grin.\r  \nWhen we left, I was so focused on what they weren\u2019t telling me, I nearly missed the first step and plunged to my death.\r  \n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re gonna want to focus on those steps,\u201d Bob said. \u201cWe had a coworker get hurt really bad because of them.\u201d\r  \n\u201cIs he ok now?\u201d\r  \nBob looked away.\r  \nToby came over and volunteered, \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d\r  \nThat was definitely what I wanted to hear.\r  \nThe next few days were a blur. Between total boredom with reading the procedure book and Bob grinning all the while refusing to tell me the big secret, I was getting super frustrated. I couldn\u2019t wait for my first night working alone. \r  \nAt least I had brought some supplies up to keep in the tower. Some snacks, a few books, and a tablet to make some notes on if I started writing a story. \r  \nFinally, the night came. I was working on my own for the first time. Surprisingly, Bob\u2019s smile vanished as he told me.\r  \n\u201cDid you ever read anything off of Reddit?\u201d he said.\r  \nI shrugged. \r  \n\u201cI don\u2019t really read much other than books.\u201d\r  \n\u201cSign up for Reddit, then go to the nosleep subreddit and look for a story called, \u2018I was a park ranger stationed in a fire tower. It had a strange set of rules.\u2019 Read that. It\u2019ll tell you what to do.\u201d\r  \n\u201cOk,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s the big secret? Read someone\u2019s made-up story?\u201d\r  \n\u201cIt might seem made up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut trust me, follow the rules.\u201d\r  \nI tried to read his expression to see if he was messing with me or not. In the five days I\u2019d known him, there was never a time he wasn\u2019t wearing that stupid grin, until now. His face was serious as a heart attack.\r  \n\u201cAlright,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll look it up later on my phone.\u201d\r  \n\u201cYou really should do it as soon as I leave.\u201d\r  \n\u201cOk.\u201d\r  \n\u201cGood luck.\u201d\r  \nHe stepped over to the door and went down the stairs. A few minutes later I heard his truck drive away.\r  \n\u201cWhat the hell was that about?\u201d\r  \nI stood in the middle of the room looking out at the beautiful trees, but not even seeing them. My mind was occupied by what Bob had said.\r  \n\u201cIt has to be a prank,\u201d I said to the empty room. \u201cBob and Toby cooked this up to scare me on my first night. Well, I\u2019m not falling for it.\u201d\r  \nI did my first round of walking around on the outside walkway, looking for any sign of fires. We worked twelve-hour shifts, so I was working from seven am to seven pm. It was late summer and still warm enough to go without a jacket, at least on my first round. By the time I got to my fourth round, there was a chill in the air. I started doing my rounds from the inside and made a mental note to bring a jacket with me tomorrow. \r  \nIt seemed odd to be talking about a jacket in late summer, but in the forest, the temperatures can vary wildly. It could be thirty degrees at night and eighty during the day. \r  \nI stepped back inside and saw my phone had lit up with a text message. I looked at it and it was Bob.\r  \n\u2018Did you read the rules yet?\u2019\r  \n\u2018No,\u2019 I texted back.\r  \n\u2018You don\u2019t have much time.\u2019\r  \nI knew this was a joke, it had to be a joke. The old timers pulling a fast one on the new guy, jerking his chain a little.\r  \n\u2018I\u2019ll get right on it,\u2019 I texted.\r  \n\u2018You better.\u2019\r  \nI put my phone down and looked at the clock. It was ten minutes after ten. Outside was now completely dark, creating a very disconcerting illusion where when I would look outside, all I saw was my reflection. I decided to turn some lights off and go with just the bare minimum. That reduced the reflection some and I could see some trees outside.\r  \nI did a slow pan around, then grabbed a bag of chips and a soda, sat down, and worked on a crossword puzzle. That only lasted a half hour until I was bored with it. I picked up a book and started to read. \r  \nI woke sometime later, with my head resting on the back of the chair, chip crumbs all over my shirt, and the book laying on the floor.\r  \nI stretched and looked over at the clock. It read two-thirteen.\r  \nI jumped up, flinging the bag of chips to the floor, realizing I\u2019d missed several checks, then ran around the room staring out at the trees. After my quick lap, I took a breath and did another slower lap to make sure there was no smoke. Thank God, there was none. \r  \nI chided myself for falling asleep on duty like that as I cleaned up my mess. I decided I should set an hourly alarm on my phone so that wouldn\u2019t happen again. \r  \nWhen I picked up the phone I noticed there was a series of texts from Bob.\r  \n\u2018Did you read it yet?\u2019\r  \n\u2018Why aren\u2019t you answering?\u2019\r  \n\u2018Are you alright?\u2019\r  \n\u2018Don\u2019t open the door for any reason.\u2019\r  \nThe last one sent chills down my spine.\r  \nWhy would I open the door in the middle of the night?\r  \nAs I was thinking this, another text came in.\r  \n\u2018For the love of God, read it!\u2019\r  \nWhat the hell was wrong with this guy? Was he seriously losing sleep for a stupid joke?\r  \nI decided I would humor him and read the story. I opened my phone and went to the Reddit site. I had just signed up and put my information in when I heard static over the radio. I stepped to the receiver and checked it. Static blared out of it, making me jump as I heard a faint voice in it.\r  \n\u201cTower seven, do you read me?\u201d I heard from a voice I could barely hear through the static.\r  \nI hesitated for a moment trying to remember if this was tower seven or not.\r  \n\u201cTower seven do you read me?\u201d the voice said sounding a little more desperate.\r  \nI picked up the mic and keyed it. \r  \n\u201cThis is tower seven, go ahead.\u201d\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s good to hear you tower seven,\u201d the voice said suddenly clear. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you would answer.\u201d\r  \n\u201cWell, here I am, awake and alert, answering you,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat did you need?\u201d\r  \n\u201cI already have what I need,\u201d the voice said sounding like it was chuckling. \u201cI\u2019d like to come visit if that\u2019s alright.\u201d\r  \n\u201cTower seven, this is base, who are you talking to?\u201d\r  \n\u201cI don\u2019t know, someone on the radio,\u201d I said into the mic.\r  \n\u201cSeven, there\u2019s no one else on this channel,\u201d base said.\r  \nI got chills for a moment. What did that mean? How was I hearing someone that base couldn\u2019t? Why would someone be calling now? Then it hit me that the base dispatcher was probably in on the joke too.\r  \n\u201cOk, base, maybe it was just some random transmission.\u201d\r  \n\u201cTower seven,\u201d the voice said. \u201cAm I alright to come from a visit?\u201d \r  \nI hesitated for a moment. What if it wasn\u2019t a joke? Who the hell is walking through the forest at two thirty in the morning?\r  \n\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll do that visit another time,\u201d I said.\r  \n\u201cVisit?\u201d base said. \u201cWhat visit? Seven, you know it\u2019s against policy to have visitors.\u201d\r  \n\u201cYeah, sorry, base, I won\u2019t be letting anyone visit.\u201d\r  \nMore static came over the radio. I could swear I could hear someone say something in the middle of it.\r  \nIt sounded like, \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\r  \nI put down the mic and picked up my phone to read the story when I saw something off in the distance. It was a light, but it was hovering, like a helicopter. I switched my phone to camera mode, zoomed in, and took a picture. It was weird because the light was blue. I didn\u2019t think helicopters had blue lights on them. Also, this light wasn\u2019t flashing, it was solid the whole time. It came closer and I took another picture. \r  \nIt floated even closer. It was mesmerizing. There was no sound. No hum, no whirring of tiny blades keeping it afloat like a drone, nothing. It was about the size of a basketball and glowing the most brilliant blue I\u2019d ever seen. I reached out for it and it backed away from my hand. I took a step closer to the edge of the walkway, reaching out as far as my arm could stretch. \r  \nIt backed away a few inches, just out of reach. I stood on my tiptoes, pushing against the railing trying to touch it. It moved away another inch. \r  \nI reached the tipping point and pinwheeled my arms to regain my balance and shove back against the railing. \r  \nI fell onto the walkway, landing hard on my backside and hitting the back of my head against the window. I looked up and the light was gone.\r  \nI shook my head, painfully stood up, and went back inside. I didn\u2019t want to do a patrol but figured I\u2019d better. After a slow walk around, I collapsed in the chair and set my alarm to go off in an hour.\r  \nAfter sitting there for a few minutes I could feel myself nodding off, so I opened my phone and started reading the story. After about ten minutes, I lowered my phone, eyes wide, hands shaking. \r  \n\u201cIt can\u2019t be real,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s just a joke.\u201d\r  \nI scrolled back through the story and re-read the rules. \r  \n1.\tNever, under any circumstances, leave the fire tower until you are relieved.\r  \n2.\tTurn off all lights between the hours of 2 and 3 am.\r  \n3.\tIf you receive a radio transmission or phone call between those hours, do not answer.\r  \n4.\tIf anyone knocks on the trapdoor during those hours tell them they\u2019ll have to wait until morning. Do not open the door.\r  \n5.\tIf you see a glowing object floating toward the tower, don\u2019t look at it. Cover your eyes and count to 50. When you open your eyes it should be gone. If not, cover and count to 50 again.\r  \n6.\tIf animals surround the tower don\u2019t go down to look. Fire your flare gun into the air twice one minute apart, then lock yourself in the bathroom and hope for the best.\r  \n My skepticism started to waver. How could they have known about those things, unless\u2026 \r  \nThere was a powerful banging at the trapdoor that made me jump. \r  \n\u201cWho is it?\u201d I said.\r  \nNo one answered. \r  \nI minute later, the pounding resumed. I searched for anything I could use as a weapon. Digging through the silverware drawer and finding an old, dull, paring knife, I backed as far away from the trapdoor as possible while staying inside. The pounding repeated. Somehow through the fear that coursed through my veins, I found my voice.\r  \n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to come back in the morning,\u201d I said.\r  \n\u201cBut I\u2019m here now tower,\u201d said the voice from the radio. \u201cLet\u2026 me\u2026 in... \u201d\r  \nThe last three words changed from asking to demanding. The voice also became deeper and more menacing.\r  \nI didn\u2019t answer. I just slid down to the floor and hugged my knees holding the knife in front of me, silently searching through the story on my phone to see if there was something I missed, some way I could remedy the situation. But there was nothing, and the end of the story didn\u2019t give me much hope. \r  \nI covered my ears and closed my eyes as the pounding continued now mixed with the voice that was going back and forth between pleading and threatening. It whispered then it screamed. It sound like a young boy, then it sounded demonic.\r  \nI rocked back and forth trying to keep some measure of sanity as the assault continued. I began to wonder how long the trapdoor would hold before whatever it was broke through.\r  \nThen suddenly it stopped.\r  \nAs happy as I was that there was no more pounding and yelling, I didn\u2019t trust it. My entire body was on pins and needles. It felt like the calm before the storm. \r  \nThe fire tower shook. It felt like an earthquake, only different. I stood and went out to the walkway to see what was happening. When I looked down, I couldn\u2019t believe it. The tower was surrounded by animals of all kinds. Deer, squirrels, bears, moose, any forest animal you could imagine, and even a couple I couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t want to identify. \r  \nAs I leaned over watching this strange menagerie, a moose rammed into one of the tower\u2019s legs. It sent a shockwave through the entire metal framework. By the time it got up to me the tower was shaking so hard it made me lose my balance.\r  \nI toppled over the edge and fell. I threw my arm out attempting to catch the rail, but only touched it with my fingertips.\r  \nI knew I was falling to my death, there was no doubt. The wind rushing in my ears didn\u2019t drown out the sound of my screaming. It sounded odd like I was listening to someone else scream. I closed my eyes, not wanting to know when the end was coming. \r  \nSuddenly something hit me hard in the ribs. I looked and I had hit a tree limb, but it didn\u2019t stop me. The branch broke sending me falling again until I hit another branch. This one tore a gash on my leg as I flipped head over heels and fell again. The next branch grazed my head and made me see stars. I bounced off another branch hitting my shoulder, then took one to the knee, and landed flat on my back on the ground. \r  \nI lay there dazed, injured, but alive and surprised to be so. As I tried to regain my bearings, I saw the animals rushing over to me. I doubted they wanted me to pet them while they licked my wounds and cared for me while singing Disney songs.\r  \nI jumped up as pain rocked my body from more places than I wanted to think about. I hopped over to the tower steps and began my long arduous journey, just a half step away from a bunch of animals that seemed dead set on my destruction. \r  \nAbout halfway up I realized there was no more pursuit, so I slowed trying to conserve energy. \r  \nI got to the top, unlocked the hatch and tried to push it open. It took several tries to get enough strength while balancing on one leg standing on the tiniest of all the tiny steps. As soon as I got it open, I turned and slammed it shut, locking it.\r  \nI hobbled into the room, found the first aid box and struggled to get to the couch. I wanted nothing more than to curl up in a ball and forget this day ever happened. \r  \nI tried to easily lay myself down, but ended up collapsing in an excruciating heap. \r  \nOnce down, I focused on bandaging the leg since it was losing the most blood. Once done, I proceeded to bandage all the rest of the areas that needed. \r  \n\u201cHow are you feeling, tower seven?\u201d I heard the voice say over the radio.\r  \nI didn\u2019t answer.\r  \n\u201cOh, come on now tower, don\u2019t be like that,\u201d it said. \u201cTalk to me. Let me in and we\u2019ll have a conversation.\u201d\r  \nI lay there trying to think of anything other than pain and this voice.\r  \n\u201cThere has to be punishment for disobeying the rules.\u201d\r  \nMy blood ran cold. How did that thing know about the rules?\r  \nI reached into my pocket and was astonished that my phone was there. It had a cracked screen, but was usable. I texted Bob.\r  \n\u2018I\u2019m alive, somehow. I broke half the rules without knowing it because I read the story too late.\u2019\r  \n\u2018Are you alright?\u2019\r  \nI took pictures of my bandaged leg that was wrapped but blood was still seeping through. I took pictures of my battered face, and my bruised ribs. I sent them all to Bob.\r  \n\u2018Good Lord, man, what did you do?\u2019\r  \n\u2018I fell out of the tower.\u2019\r  \n\u2018You did what?\u2019\r  \n\u2018Was leaning over the edge of the walkway when one of the animals smashed into the support leg and shook the tower, knocking me over.\u2019\r  \n\u2018How are you alive?\u2019\r  \n\u2018Tree caught me.\u2019\r  \n\u2018I\u2019ll call the paramedics and come in early to relieve you.\u2019\r  \n\u2018I\u2019ll be laying here on the couch, bleeding.\u2019\r  \nThen I added, \u2018I\u2019ll follow the rules from now on.\u2019\r  \nThere was static on the radio and a faint voice said, \u201cYou\u2019d better.\u201d\r  \n\\*\\*\\*\r  \nWhen Bob unlocked the hatch and led the EMTs in, he didn\u2019t have that grin on his face. \r  \n\u201cYou ok, kid?\u201d he said.\r  \n\u201cHunky dory, how about you?\u201d I said laying on the cushions that were soaked in my own blood.\r  \n\u201cHe might be in shock,\u201d one of the EMTs said.\r  \nMy rescue was an adventure in itself. When they examined me they informed me that my leg was broken. I was sweating trying to go back down those steps with a splint on. I could just see me slipping near the top and falling again. There didn\u2019t seem to be any trees close enough to catch me on this side. \r  \nApparently, the EMTs seemed to be thinking the same thing. Someone came up with the brilliant idea of tying me to a backboard and trying to carry me down the steps. After two EMTs nearly fell, they decided to tie it to a rope and lower me like a sack of potatoes. \r  \nThey rigged up a rope around one of the support poles for the walkway. Watching the rope scrape along the edges of the wood, fraying as it went was probably more terrifying than anything I\u2019d experienced last night. \r  \nFloating in the air, spinning slowly didn\u2019t help my fear of heights any. I decided to close my eyes and try to stay as still as possible so the balance wouldn\u2019t be disturbed and slide me out of the end to fall to my death.\r  \nI was extremely grateful when the board hit the ground. My adrenaline finally crashed and I fell into a deep sleep as they loaded me into the ambulance.\r  \n\\*\\*\\*\r  \nTruth be told, I\u2019m absolutely terrified to go back to the tower. It\u2019s not like I have a lot of choices. Park ranger is a good paying job and sitting around watching for fires is about the easiest job I\u2019ve ever heard of. \r  \nIf you take away the supernatural voices, bizarre wildlife, strange lights, and the stairs of death. \r  \nI\u2019m hoping paying attention to the rules will keep me safe.\r  \nI\u2019m posting this as a warning. If your job has some strange rules, make sure you follow them, no matter how stupid you think they might be.",

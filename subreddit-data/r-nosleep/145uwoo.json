Further posts may need more time or be corrupted.\n\nBlood spilling form my arm, i reach to my screwdriver, unactivating the drill seconds before it reached the center of the planet. The fire engulps me and i start to think how did it come to this.\n\nI came from a wealty family in virginia, spending my life playing with radios. I was the popular girl in school, but suddently lost all popularity when i was diagnosed with ADHD. Only god knows why my dad suggested i was put to work at a young age, forcing me to be at the radio station at the organization.\n\nI am Rosa Moore, i was assigned to that quiet station, station number four, in which tragedy struck. Time at the radio was... Boring, with nothing to do all day long. I would have killed to have a better job, i started to secretly envy everyone. Maybe this is the reason that day i was disrtaught... Maybe i did not care enough for Mark to send an immediate alarm. All i know is, my stupidity, my envy, my hatred for my job, is what brought me to eventual death.\n\nI did not know of the hive mind project until, for the heat generated by the incident, i was assigned to the termination team, which was somehow even worse than the radio.\n\n\"For Humanity and the World!\" was our motto, jeez, i heard that stupid phrase at least a thousand times altready.\n\nMy pain did not las long, i died in about 5 missions, which is cool for me, at least i died like a hero...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTranscript n\u00b0 0174480 (24/7/37):\n\n1304- So?\n\n1407- Yes, yes I checked, everything works, now go do YOUR job and leave me alone to do mine.\n\n1304- Did you check the door?\n\n1407- No need to! We have AL!\n\n1304- You cannot let an AI do your job, you know that sometimes AL goes faulty.\n\n1407- How many times did it happen?\n\n1304- One, and that is already one too much, remember what happened to Alex...\n\n1407- You're overreacting... It was ONE finger, we lose fingers all the time!\n\n1304- Yea, first a finger, then an hand, then an arm, and then you're gonna get cut in half by a freaking door!\n\n1407- Just... Shut up and go, 01 wanted to see you, didn't he? You don't wanna make him wait...\n\n1304- *Sigh* We'll talk about this later.\n\nTranscript ends here.\n\nTranscript n\u00b0 0187743 (11/9/38):\n\n1407- But why?\n\n01- We talked about it Rosa, Mark and Jonas were the most promising interns, they could have changed the world.\n\n1407- But i don't want to!\n\n01- It's an order.\n\n1407- I don't care about your orders! My life is altready terrible enough! I don't want to spend my time killing idiots!\n\n01- You should have tought about that when you caused the death of Mark!\n\n\\*Loud crying\\*\n\n01- Bring her away.\n\nTranscript ends here.\n\nTranscript n\u00b0 0189714 (2/10/38):\n\n1405- How's it?\n\n1407- How's what?\n\n1405- Being here.\n\n1407- Oh, it sucks.\n\n1405- Were you forced to be here?\n\n1407- Yea. It's hard enjoying anything here when the guy in charge is a brain dead pile of stale bread.\n\n1405- Haha, nice one, you're gonna learn to enjoy your stay here, no supervisors and you get near death experiences only once every week.\n\n1407- Heh, better than nothing, at least I'm not at the radio anymore. That was real boring.\n\n1405- Why did you get sent here?\n\n1407- Two guys died because of me.\n\n1405- Cool, straight to the point. I stabbed someone with the canteen knives.\n\n1407- The plastic ones? how?!\n\n1405- I spent days making one as sharp as i could. The guy really asked for it.\n\n1407- Lemme guess, Jonas?\n\n1405- How did you know?\n\n1407- I spent 2 years with him. Guessing is not hard.\n\n1405- How is he doing?\n\n1407- He's dead.\n\n1405- Oh...\n\n1406- Guys! We need you! Kyle got his arm stuck in the freaking air vent again!\n\n1407- I swear next time I'm gonna amputate his arm!\n\nTranscript ends here.\n\nTranscript n\u00b0 0189770 (2/12/38):\n\n\\*gunshots and screams\\*\n\n1405- God! It's one of those abominations again! How are humans willing to become like that?!\n\n1406- I can bet that they'r using some kind of brainwashing.\n\n1405- Rosa! Open the panel! I will keep the thing at bay!\n\n1407- Sure!\n\n\\*Scream\\*\n\n1405- Oh god, no more artillery i guess, do your best, i will make this thing into swiss cheese.\n\n1407- Corporal, you owe me a working screwdriver.\n\n\\*More screaming\\*\n\n1405- Rosa!\n\n\\*Gunshots\\*\n\n1407- The thing dug a hole trough my freaking arm!\n\n1405- Don't worry i have a bunch of pain killers, never go out without one, you should already know this, right?\n\n1407- Isn't it getting... Hot?\n\n1405- Oh god, check the damn height!\n\n1407- Crap! We're already kilometers down, let's just unscrew this thing and get out ASAP.\n\n1405- I cannot resist this heat anymore, just, if you survive, tell that idiot of Kyle that he owed me 10 bucks!\n\n1407- Hah...I'll just unscrew this thing and wait...\n\n1405- Man, this heat is gonna get me passing out, right Rosa?\n\n*Muffled sounds*\n\n1405- Rosa?\n\n*Muffled sounds*\n\nTranscript ends here\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRoosa Moore died of extreme heat, while deactivating a drill directed to the center of the earth. World end corp. needs further investigation, and the superiors of the company have supposed fleed from the scene, without any further trace left, most of the people working there were arrested, for now, the threat is deemed neutralized. Rosa's family was told that she died of a mysterious plague, during a trip to [data expunged from high clearance station]. They were given her ashes after two weeks.\n\nThese files MUST remain in full secrecy until humanity doesn't die and the new species take full control over the planet.\n\nE.N: The end is not today, thanks Rosa.\n-1405",

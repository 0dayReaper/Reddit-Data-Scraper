    "postText": "I always knew my family was involved in some strange things. We never celebrated Christmas, Easter, or even Festivus. No, our main holiday was the Overtide on the first full moon after the summer solstice. As my parents constantly drilled into my head, we were Reepiners, the few remaining mystics of an ancient path. The Reepiners devoted their lives to travel. We explored other worlds, other universes even. Many of us died on the way, or sometimes, travelers from our spiritual path would come back totally insane and rambling. Some had even clawed their own eyes out, as if trying to stop the horrors they were seeing.\n\n\nMy father had no real power in the Reepiners, but he was one of the most accomplished travelers in the world. The young male children of the leaders would often accompany my father out to the woods and ancient cave systems near our house where he would show them unimaginable things. One of the young trainees, a brash young man who couldn\u2019t have been older than seventeen, came back with totally white hair after a single night in the caves with my father. When I asked my dad what happened, he simply gave me a sly smile and walked away.\n\n\nOn my own seventeenth birthday, which took place a few years ago, I was to follow my father out into the forest before sunset. We would be heading to Hollowhead Cave, a ten-mile hike from the parking area. My father found the dirt road, pulling over on a slight turnaround. The nearest neighbor was miles down the road. We took no cell phones or supplies with us. We didn\u2019t have so much as a knife.\n\n\nWe had been hiking for hours. I could feel blisters starting to form on my feet, and trickles of sweat rolled down from my hairline. The insects buzzed and chirped in the ferns and trees surrounding us, and a cloud of gnats followed us everywhere we went. There was a slight smell of flowers in the air mixed with pines. Other than the insects, it was a beautiful and peaceful forest. Finally, my father broke the long silence.\n\n\n\u201cAre you scared?\u201d my father asked. I looked over at him. His strange, gray eyes were watching me, studying me. They seemed to snap and sizzle with inner energy. My father looked younger than his age, sturdy and well-built. Muscles grown over a lifetime of work filled out his clothes. Even though he was in his fifties, he had almost no wrinkles on his face and few white hairs.\n\n\nThose are eyes that have seen beyond, I thought to myself. Those are eyes that have seen other worlds. The light that seems to shine from them must be holy. It must be the light of a thousand other universes.\n\n\n\u201cDoes traveling really bring enlightenment, Pa?\u201d I said. He shrugged, looking forward again.\n\n\n\u201cIt may, or it may not. Enlightenment is already here at every moment, just like the same deathless mind is always present in every universe, or the same eternal soul is present in all the seconds of your life. Traveling to other spaces may help you see how this eternal consciousness is the same in every universe, how that endless mind stretches everywhere. It is more of a deepening awareness that you get from travel, one that brings enough wisdom to see the eternal is already here. But you didn\u2019t answer my question,\u201d my father said.\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\n\n\\***\n\n\nIt was nearly dark when we got to the cave. My father had been quiet most of the way. Now as he knelt in front of me, I saw what looked like a hand mirror in his back pocket, rolled up in cloth.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that in your pocket?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\u201cI always hold the black mirror,\u201d he said. \u201cWe use it for training the young, opening them up to the idea of traveling, showing them a little of what is out there waiting for those with courage and fanaticism on their side.\u201d The cave was cool and refreshing. Torches had been put out all along the walls, though I don\u2019t know when they were lit. I heard what sounded like a babbling stream echoing up through the rocky chambers, and I smelled far-off water mixing with the smoke of the torches.\n\n\n\u201cWhat about the red mirror?\u201d I whispered. I had heard rumors about it, but they were vague and contradictory.\n\n\n\u201cThe red mirror? We don\u2019t generally speak of it. High Priest Arkovitch personally attends to it most of the year. He tries to make it sleep. He tells me that prayer and meditation seem to soothe it. But sometimes it wakes up. I\u2019ll tell you a story while we walk. It\u2019ll make the time pass faster.\u201d His voice seemed to crack slightly at this. His face looked grimmer and thinner in the flickering light. He looked at me with his strange, gray eyes, and in them, I saw the traveler my father truly was. He had an iron core that was so fearless, it almost seemed mad. He gave a nearly inaudible sigh, then he started the story.\n\n\n\u201cHigh Priest Arkovitch was given the three mirrors in a somewhat strange way. He was on a meditative retreat, sleeping outside, drinking from the streams, eating ferns and mushrooms and whatever else he could scrounge. After the first day, he woke up to a pile of dead squirrels next to his head. Their necks were all snapped, and they were stacked in a little pyramid.\n\n\n\u201cThe second night, he tried to stay up, but after hours of standing guard, he lost the battle. He says he fell asleep with his back against a tree. When he awoke, he found a pile of hundreds of shoes surrounding him. He says that when he left the spot to forage or drink, these piles were taken away in the blink of an eye. It was as if they hadn\u2019t been there at all. And there was no sign of anyone in the forest. He was out about a dozen miles from the road, far down a winding deer trail. He wasn\u2019t going to be spooked by these childish pranks, he told me. He stayed another night.\n\n\n\u201cThis time, he awoke to find a black box next to him. He opened it, expecting an animal\u2019s head or some other rubbish, but instead, he found these three strange mirrors. He touched them all in turn, the white, the red and the black, and then he pulled them out. He looked into the red. The flat, polished stone on both sides sure made a poor mirror, he told me. In fact, all three of them were almost totally useless. They were clearly hand mirrors, of that he was certain, but who would put just a slightly reflective stone inscribed with strange runes in place of the actual mirror glass? And then his mind made a connection. He had heard of shamans doing similar things to this, making special hand mirrors for rites involving psychedelic drugs or mystical experiences, such as the shamans in Africa with their iboga vine.\n\n\n\u201cAs he looked into it, though, he said the strange runes seemed to start glowing. They sent out red light that pierced straight into his head. He said he tried closing his eyes, but even with them fully shut, all he could see was swirling tunnels of red light. And then he was gone.\n\n\n\u201cWhen we travel, son, you know we hear the ringing. Any time you cross universes, all you can hear is that incessant, high-pitched sound which seems to vibrate your teeth and makes your eyes water.\u201d I nodded. I had done some astral projection and lucid dreaming, both of which were considered vastly inferior by the Reepiners, like toys for children to play with. The most advanced in our religion always traveled bodily. It was considered the way to Liberation. Enlightenment itself was the goal, and seeing the true nature of all things by travel was the principal path. But some of the older members of our religion had told me that it was also terrifying, especially since anyone who traveled bodily could die if something in these strange, alien worlds attacked them.\n\n\n\u201cArkovitch says the ringing was the most intense he had ever heard. He said he thought his head would split open. The red light still blinded him, but he felt himself floating. And then he felt the light receding and opened his eyes. The ringing in his ears gradually faded as he looked around, realizing he was in a strange jungle, still holding the red mirror in one hand. But the runes had stopped glowing and faded back into the stone, and the mirror again just looked like a useless decoration.\n\n\n\u201cHe says the trees of the jungle stretched hundreds of feet above him with slippery, yellow trunks and thin branches periodically reaching out. Ferns taller than a man surrounded him. He could barely see over the thick vegetation. There were no cries of birds, no insects, no animals or any kind he could see. And then he heard a rustling, just a slight movement. Turning, he saw a blood-red shape duck into the ferns.\n\n\n\u201cArkovitch began to run. He ran for his life. He didn\u2019t know what kind of world he was, but he knew when he was being stalked. He heard more of those things, saw glimpses of that bright red hide they had. Then one jumped directly in front of him.\n\n\n\u201cIt stood over ten feet tall, he said, with dozens of black eyes on stalks rising from the top of its thin, oval head. Its legs were sleek and reptilian, like the legs of a velociraptor, and long arms with knife-like claws at the end. It opened its mouth wide, showing rows of parallel serrated teeth, and from a bulging orange sac in the back of its throat, it spit at him. Sticky white webs shot out and wrapped around his legs before he even knew what was happening. And then he heard dozens more of those things closing in all around him, ready to begin shredding his body. These were clearly the apex predators. He was stupid for not realizing why there were no animal sounds now, he said. Likely the life in the area had gone silent and moved on when they realized a herd of those things were in the area.\n\n\n\u201cAs the nearest one bent down, hissing, silver streams of saliva running down its pointed chin, Arkovitch picked up the red mirror. Instinctively, he traced his fingers along the runes, hoping for any sign of life from it. At once, it lit up, blinding him with red light, and he felt himself floating again, the ringing in his ears. He awoke at his house, nearly twenty miles away from where he had started just minutes earlier, still wrapped in webs.\u201d My father stopped in front of me. We had just come to a sharp turn in the cave, the rocks jutting out on both sides and making it thin and claustrophobic. I had to turn my body to slide through. I saw my father having more trouble with his larger frame, but eventually he pushed himself through, sweating and slightly scraped up.\n\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere do you think he went?\u201d My father shrugged.\n\n\n\u201cSon, the mirrors can send you anywhere at any time, but the red mirror in particular tends to send travelers to the worst places, where predators or demons are waiting. Other times, people have found themselves on nearly dead planets where strange robed beings floated in the mists. Arkovitch\u2019s son used the red mirror, and he never came back at all. The mirror just showed back up in Arkovitch\u2019s office after his son had been missing for three days. We don\u2019t know where they went, and we don\u2019t want more people being lost in such a way. \n\n\n\u201cAnd now, we are here,\u201d my father finished saying. I looked around, frowning. It looked like just another part of the cave to me. And then, I realized I did see something. Out of the corner of my eye, one of the walls of the cave seemed to shimmer and glow. When I got close to it and touched it, it felt warm, too- much warmer than the other stone walls of the cave. It was only a space about the size of a door.\n\n\n\u201cYes, my son,\u201d my father said, \u201cthat is the gateway where we will send you through. Your test of manhood will be to see where the black mirror takes you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf the red mirror took Arkovitch without any door, why do we need this one?\u201d I asked. My father leaned in close.\n\n\n\u201cSo that you don\u2019t come back twenty miles away, at the bottom of a lake, or two thousand miles away at the bottom of some volcano,\u201d he said. My heart was beating fast, and my stomach started to hurt. I was having second thoughts.\n\n\n\u201cOK, let\u2019s do this,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s see where the mirror takes me.\u201d He nodded and took out the supplies for the ritual. With a prayer to the eternal mind, he handed me the mirror.\n\n\nIt felt much heavier than it looked. Moreover, it was as cold as death. As soon as I touched it, the runes lit up, blinding me. Pure white light shot out of them, and the shimmering of the doorway was so intense now that I saw sparks and electricity. And then, the wall opened.\n\n\nEvery hair was standing up as I watched it happen, as if I were underneath a forming lightning bolt. All I could hear was buzzing. Holding the mirror tightly, I walked forward, through the doorway. Instantly, everything went black and the buzzing and electricity stopped.\n\n\nI opened my eyes in a strange place. The sun was warm, and the wind blew so fiercely that during the strongest gusts, I stumbled and feared I may lose my footing. Looking around, I saw mountains with iron and other metals peeking out, forming sharp, irregular blocks at the bottom. The tops disappeared under thick, stratified yellow clouds that blocked out the sky. Even the sun here was no more than a hazy, orange silhouette in the impenetrable cloud layer.\n\n\nI looked around, unsure of where to go. I could barely see any signs of life on this planet, besides some strange, brown moss growing on the bases of the mountains. I couldn\u2019t ask my dad or the mirror for help. But then, I heard something. At first, I thought it was part of the wind. But I quickly realized that it sounded more like gurgling and screaming. I realized with horror that it was in English.\n\n\n\u201cHelp\u2026\u201d the voice said. \u201cPlease, for the love of God, help me before it comes back.\u201d I followed the voice around some rocks standing twenty feet high and found a man on the ground- prostrate, bloody and missing a leg. He raised his head at my appearance and I realized I knew who this was. It was High Priest Arkovitch\u2019s son, the one who had gone missing a while back. It was almost hard to recognize him with stringy hair, bloody scraped skin and nearly all of his clothes torn or missing, but I could still see it in the eyes and construction of the face.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d I said, leaning down. \u201cI\u2019ll get you out. It\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s coming back. We have to go now\u2026\u201d He looked behind me, and his eyes widened. \u201cOh God, it\u2019s too late.\u201d Without any weapon or even an idea where I was, I turned to look at what horrors this world held- the same ones that presumably had torn off or even eaten this poor man\u2019s leg. As soon as I saw it, I began to scream.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m writing this as a warning to anyone who might come across a device that looks like a cheap toy with wires and electrodes attached to it. Do not use it. Do not touch it. Do not even look at it. It is not a toy. It is not a game. It is a nightmare.  \nI know this because I made the mistake of using it. And I\u2019m still paying for it.  \nIt all started when I had a lucid dream one night. I dreamed that I was visited by a mysterious figure who claimed to be my future self. He looked like me, but older and more confident. He smiled and said he had a gift for me. A gift that would change my life forever.  \nHe handed me the device and explained what it was. He said it was a time travel device that worked through dreams. He said it could manipulate my brain waves and induce lucid dreaming, which is when you are aware that you are dreaming and can control your dreams. He said it could also control the flow of time in my dreams, so that I could make time go faster or slower, or even stop it altogether. He said I could create any world I wanted, any scenario I desired, any adventure I craved. And he said that no matter how long I dreamed, no time would pass in the real world.  \nHe said it was very simple to use. I just had to put the electrodes on my temples and press the button. It would activate the lucid dreaming mode and allow me to control time in my dreams. I could adjust the speed of time with a dial on the device. I could also use a switch to turn off the device and wake up anytime I wanted.  \nHe said he had used it many times himself and it was safe and effective.  \nHe said he had to go now, but before he left, he had one more thing to tell me.  \nHe leaned closer and whispered in my ear:  \n\u201cDon\u2019t kill your grandfather.\u201d  \nHe winked and disappeared.  \nI woke up with a jolt.  \nI looked around my room and saw that everything was normal.  \nI checked my clock and saw that it was still the same time as when I went to bed.  \nI realized that it was all a dream.  \nOr was it?  \nI noticed that I was still holding the device in my hand.  \nIt felt cold and heavy.  \nI felt a pang of curiosity and excitement.  \nI decided to try it out.  \nI put the electrodes on my temples and pressed the button.  \nI closed my eyes and waited for something to happen.  \nI felt a tingling sensation in my head.  \nI opened my eyes again.  \nI was no longer in my room.  \nI was in a different world.  \nA world of my own creation.  \nA world where I could time travel through dreams.  \nI smiled and began to explore my new reality.  \nBut I soon realized that my new reality was not as simple as I had imagined. I discovered that every dream world I created had its own rules, its own logic, its own challenges. I discovered that every choice I made in my dream worlds had its own consequences, both for myself and for others. I discovered that every adventure I embarked on had its own risks, both for my body and for my mind.  \nI also realized that my new reality was not as isolated as I had hoped. I encountered other dreamers who had also used the device, some of whom were friendly, some of whom were hostile, some of whom were familiar, some of whom were strangers. I encountered other beings who inhabited my dream worlds, some of whom were human, some of whom were not, some of whom were benign, some of whom were malevolent. I encountered other forces that influenced my dream worlds, some of whom were natural, some of whom were supernatural, some of whom were benevolent, some of whom were evil.  \nAnd I realized that my new reality was not as stable as I had expected. I noticed that every time I used the device, I changed something in my dream worlds, sometimes intentionally, sometimes unintentionally. I noticed that every time I changed something in my dream worlds, I changed something in myself, sometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously. I noticed that every time I changed something in myself, I changed something in the real world, sometimes visibly, sometimes invisibly.  \nI began to question my new reality. I wondered if it was really worth it to escape from one reality into another. I wondered if it was really possible to create a perfect reality for myself. I wondered if it was really ethical to manipulate reality according to my wishes. I wondered if it was really wise to ignore reality altogether.  \nI began to doubt my new reality. I doubted if it was really real or just an illusion. I doubted if it was really his or just a projection. I doubted if it was really free or just determined. I doubted if it was really meaningful or just absurd.  \nI began to fear my new reality. I feared that I might lose myself in my dream worlds, that I might forget who I was and where I came from. I feared that I might harm myself in my dream worlds, that I might damage my body or my mind beyond repair. I feared that I might hurt others in my dream worlds, that I might violate their rights or their dignity. I feared that I might destroy the real world, that I might cause irreversible harm to nature or to society.  \nI began to hate my new reality. He hated that it was so complex and unpredictable, that it challenged his expectations and assumptions. He hated that it was so diverse and plural, that it exposed him to different perspectives and values. He hated that it was so dynamic and unstable, that it forced him to adapt and change. He hated that it was so paradoxical and contradictory, that it defied his logic and reason.  \nI wanted to end my new reality. He wanted to stop using the device, to stop time traveling through dreams. He wanted to return to his old reality, to resume his normal life. He wanted to destroy the device, to prevent anyone else from using it.  \nBut he couldn\u2019t.  \nHe couldn\u2019t because he was addicted to his new reality. He was addicted to the thrill and the wonder of his dream worlds. He was addicted to the power and the freedom of his device. He was addicted to the escape and the fantasy of his time travel.  \nHe couldn\u2019t because he was dependent on his new reality. He was dependent on the device for his happiness and fulfillment. He was dependent on the dream worlds for his identity and purpose. He was dependent on the time travel for his survival and sanity.  \nHe couldn\u2019t because he was trapped in his new reality. He was trapped by the device, which had become part of him, which had altered his brain and body. He was trapped by the dream worlds, which had become his home, which had shaped his soul and spirit. He was trapped by the time travel, which had become his destiny, which had sealed his fate.  \nHe couldn\u2019t because he was doomed by his new reality. He was doomed by the device, which had a hidden flaw, which had a fatal malfunction. He was doomed by the dream worlds, which had a dark secret, which had a terrible truth. He was doomed by the time travel, which had a paradoxical consequence, which had a horrific outcome.  \nHe couldn\u2019t because he was haunted by his new reality. He was haunted by a mysterious figure who claimed to be his future self. The figure who had given him the device in the first place. The figure who had warned him not to kill his grandfather.  \nThe figure who had lied to him.  \nThe figure who had betrayed him.  \nThe figure who had doomed him.  \nThe figure who was him.  \nAnd he realized too late that his new reality was not a gift.  \nIt was a curse.  \nAnd he screamed.  \nBut no one heard him.  \nNo one except the figure.  \nThe figure who smiled wickedly.  \nThe figure who said:  \n\u201cWelcome to your nightmare.\u201d  \nAnd then he showed me what he had done.  \nHe showed me how he had killed my grandfather in one of my dream worlds, creating a paradox that erased me from existence.  \nHe showed me how he had unleashed a plague of nightmares in all of my dream worlds, turning them into hellish realms of terror and pain.  \nHe showed me how he had corrupted all of the other dreamers with his device, making them into twisted versions of themselves who served him as slaves and minions. He showed me how he had destroyed the real world with his device, unleashing a wave of chaos and madness that consumed everything in its path. He showed me how he had become the master of all realities, the lord of all dreams, the king of all nightmares. He showed me how he had become \u2026 IT.",

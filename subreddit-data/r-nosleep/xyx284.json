    "postText": "I\u2019m not homeless.\n\nI have a home. I just don\u2019t own it. But it\u2019s mine and I work to keep it. Every city has its fair share of abandoned buildings to squat in, but usually you gotta deal with either cops or shitty neighbours. The Annedale High Rise has neither. Police stay away, so do the locals. As a stranger from out of town I stumbled across the place on my first night in the city and thought it a little strange that a 28 story tower block had been left to rot. Every window black. Every light in the courtyard smashed. No cars in the lot. No booth for a guard. Not even barbed wire on the fence. Barely half-a-mile from a playground filled with shouting drunken teenagers but none of them strayed in the direction of Annedale. No fires or music or bottles hurtling through the air. It was silent.\n\nInside, I found that the lobby had been torn to shit. Double doors ripped open and left that way for what looked like years. Easy access for the curious, but I was the only one there. Most of the first story had collapsed. Waterlogged ceiling tiles turned to mulch by shitty British weather. I know water is invasive, but it had practically fucking colonised the place so bad algae was growing up the walls. Even the elevator shaft was flooded. My own reflection looking back at me as I peered through brackish water and caught a glimpse of the old rusted carriage just a few feet below. I couldn\u2019t help but think about standing on top of it, waist high, and reaching down to pull open the emergency hatch. Only natural to wonder what was down there. Little metal box soaking in pitch black water for years and years. I thought about pressing the button, calling it up and seeing the elevator rise in spite of all logic. An image I still think of from time to time.\n\nMeanwhile the empty shaft loomed above, cables whistling in the wind. I\u2019ve learned not to linger by it. If you look up you\u2019ll sometimes see something ducking out of the way, pulling its head through the doors before you get a good look. It finds it awfully funny, even tries to make a game out of it, like peekaboo. Play too much though and it starts to pop up elsewhere. Any open door becomes an invitation. Sent more than a few people running for their lives in the middle of the night, but bad news for them. That thing is more than free to leave this place if it\u2019s part of a game.\n\nIf you ask about Annedale most people just shrug or laugh. Kids\u2019ll talk about it same way they talk about any haunted house. Difference is no one dares anyone to go up there. No one uses it to get pissed or high. No one sneaks into the basement to have a risky little fuck. No one hides their stashes there. It has all the hallmarks of your classic urban legend, only people *actually* stay away. They\u2019ll laugh and joke and tell scary stories, but they treat the soil its on like it houses a radioactive leak. And the council, I\u2019m surprised they haven\u2019t knocked it down but they, out of everyone in the city, have the most to lose by talking about it.\n\nThey built it in the mid fifties as government housing. Only a lot of the young mothers who moved in there found their children\u2019s health taking a turn for the worse. Started with newborns. Babies that wouldn\u2019t wake after a peaceful night\u2019s sleep. The kinda deaths that got written off as either negligence or abuse, screaming teenage girls hauled off to prison on the words of doctors who didn\u2019t give a shit. It\u2019s always the mother\u2019s fault in some people\u2019s eyes, and these girls had no one to stand up for them. Two in the first year, four in the next, and they kept on coming for every year until it closed.\n\nWasn\u2019t until 1982 that someone traced the source of deaths to tainted water storage on the roof. Toxic metals leeching into the supply. Not enough to kill an adult, but bad news for anyone with weak immune systems. Thirty eight women had been imprisoned by then. Another twenty three had killed themselves before they could be sentenced. And those are just the ones accounted for. Not all the deaths were from the water. Annedale has a way of being bad for any child\u2019s health, no matter the circumstance.\n\nMore than a few toddlers starved to death as their parents rotted in the tub from an overdose. Even more were lost when they found their parent\u2019s stash, little bodies wracked with agonising fits as their panicked mothers screamed for help. One tripped down the elevator shaft because the doors opened as if the carriage was right there. And those are the ones who were found. Plenty more went missing, written off as runaways. In the end Annedale\u2019s reputation as a cursed place got so bad the only way out was to shut the whole thing down. Board it up. Erase it from the records. Pretend it never happened and just forget.\n\nBut Annedale kept on killing even after the doors were officially shut. If anything it only got nastier. Talked to one cop who told me he found a guy dead from sepsis on the sixth floor couple years after the place was shut down. No one could fucking believe it. They reckon this guy scratched himself on a nail and caught gangrene like it was the 1800s. Never went to the hospital. Just laid there and died slowly and painfully as the infection spread, but not before he took every last bit of furniture in the room and shoved it against the door. Strange enough on its own, but it was the flag he\u2019d made out of his own clothes that freaked everyone out. He\u2019d scrawled *HELP* on it, like he wanted to get someone\u2019s attention down below even though the lock was on his side. He could\u2019ve left anytime he wanted.\n\nCop I spoke to said he was there when they kicked the door down. Still remembers the look in dead man\u2019s eyes. He was glaring at the door two days after he\u2019d passed, white knuckled fists gripping a blanket that smelled sickly sweet from all that infection.\n\nThere were others too. Lots of people falling, many of them without a good reason. Got so bad they bricked the roof door but by the time I arrived someone had cleared it all away with a sledge hammer. I still don\u2019t hang out up there. Not after I first went up and saw pale fingers gripping the ledge, like someone was hanging off it and holding on for dear life. I reckon a lotta people see something like that and think a person needs their help. They go rushing over to offer a hand. But when I saw it something about those grimy nails set alarm bells off in my head. Fingers looked all wrong. So I took my coat off and used a broom handle to move it closer to the ledge. Sure enough those ugly hands snatched at the coat and ripped it outta my hands, sending it hurtling to the parking lot below. I\u2019ve thought about taking a closer look from time to time, but I got a thing about heights and could never bring myself to investigate it much further.\n\nYou\u2019d think I\u2019d leave, but it\u2019s my home. I own it as much as it owns me. People even refer to me as the caretaker now like they forgot I wasn\u2019t always here. Police treat me the same, can you believe that? Any reports of a break in and they call me on my number to go take a look, like I\u2019m some sort of official. Only other guy who was here as long as me was the philosopher. I don\u2019t know his name, just call him that because of the books he left behind. He came here back when the block was still just a place to live and he stuck around for a few years after its closure. Lots of notebooks in his flat. Thousands of pages talking about child sacrifice made to gods who don\u2019t like being named, along with pictures of strange things frozen in ice and medical photos that look fake.\n\nAt first I thought he came to document the curse. He has dozens of books just recording all the strange things he saw, like birds with too many wings or milk that turned to clotted blood in the bottle. But after going through every thing he owned I found letters to a wife who\u2019d died in childbirth. He kept her death certificate way at the back of an old looking box filled with the letters he\u2019d kept writing her long after the date.\n\nAnother box, just a row over, had the letters she\u2019d written back. Awful things scrawled on random scraps, shit and blood for ink. He dated them himself and sometimes wrote notes about how they came to him.\n\n*Delivered by a rat that was cannibalised in front of me.*\n\n*Pulled by my dentist from a cavity in my mouth.*\n\n*Written in the web of a spider with thirteen legs.*\n\nAnyway, he gives away the real reason he moved to Annedale in one of the letters. Says that Annedale was the key to helping her, that he was weeks away from figuring out how to open the door. Told his wife he\u2019d bring her back. Told her he knew how. I\u2019ve never figured out where he went next or what happened to him, but his apartment was locked when I found it and likely would\u2019ve stayed that way if the key hadn\u2019t turned up in my inside pocket on the first morning. Now I live in his old place. It\u2019s safe in there. He\u2019s written things on the wall that keep everything well behaved. Symbols that I don\u2019t understand but which are easy to trace so that\u2019s what I do. I go over them every couple of months and so far they\u2019ve kept me safe and sane.\n\nBecause you do need protection in Annedale. I don\u2019t know when in its history the curse went from something mundane to something very real and very dark. It wasn\u2019t all just bad luck or poverty, not by the end and certainly not anymore. You can\u2019t just go strolling around Annedale, certainly not at night. It\u2019s dangerous. For one thing, it attracts a constant rotation of the deeply unwell who are likely to attack on sight, if you\u2019re luckly. They usually turn up dead in the halls come morning, although sometimes it\u2019s just bits of them that I come across. Strips of skin floating on the brackish water that floods the basement stairwell, or bloodied fingernails embedded in the ceiling plaster. Weirdest one was a single tooth in a lightbulb, bloody gum still attached to the root, the glass all around it somehow intact.\n\nMany of them come here with business, something a little like the philosopher\u2019s. Rituals. Bargains. Things like that. It\u2019s not a good idea to interrupt them, or to give them even the slightest hint you might be a problem. Every night I lock my door and wait for Annedale\u2019s business to finish and come morning I do a sweep, floor by floor, and clean up whatever\u2019s left of the tower block\u2019s strange pilgrims.\n\nMost of the rituals don\u2019t look real to me. In fact, I reckon a lotta people who come here just end up as victims of something or someone else. There are a *lot* of reasons to stay out of Annedale at night, and most of its visitors strike me as a little na\u00efve. Most of what I see looks like it got stolen from a bad death metal album. I once found a book called \u201cSatanism and Witchcraft in the 21st Century\u201d. It\u2019s hard to imagine that the secret inner workings of the universe can be found in something with an ISBN number and 3000 Amazon reviews. Of course, not all attempts at exploiting Annedale\u2019s energy are so hackneyed. I had one guy turn up at my door and pay me three grand in cash just to show him the darkest corner in the building. I wasn\u2019t sure what he meant at first. Thought he meant light and shadow.\n\n\u201cSort of,\u201d he replied when I explained this to him. \u201cDarkness like that can be part of it. But I\u2019m looking for a corner, has to be a right angle or more acute. Ideally, more acute. You understand that term right?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d seemed arrogant and that last sentence confirmed as much. Good looking guy in his late twenties, nice suit. Looked like the stereotypical banker. Acted like one too.\n\n\u201cPlenty of places like that,\u201d I said. \u201cLots of funny rooms in Annedale. People trying to make the most of limited space. Sometimes the walls meet at tight angles, sure. But I don\u2019t know what you mean about dark. There\u2019s the basement. It\u2019s flooded. Can\u2019t think of anywhere darker than that.\u201d\n\nHe bit his lip and hesitated for a second or two, as if he was actually contemplating it.\n\n\u201cNot a bad suggestion actually, but no, too difficult to reach. And I don\u2019t just mean dark as in the absence of light. I mean dark like under the bed. Dark like that one chip in a wall that leads to a hollow space between the bricks and as a child you can\u2019t help but wonder what lives there. Somewhere that just inexplicably feels\u2026 like it\u2019s not got as much of God\u2019s attention on it as everywhere else.\u201d\n\nI thought about this for a second. His words were vague but damn if I didn\u2019t know what he meant.\n\n\u201cA corner?\u201d I asked. \u201cHas to be an acute corner?\u201d\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\u201cI think I know the place,\u201d I said and he smiled like real creep.\n\nI took him to a flat on the eighth floor. It was rundown like everywhere else but there was still enough of its old furniture lying around. You can pull open random drawers in there and still see the cutlery people once used. There\u2019s even an old analogue TV on an old stand. You can perch on what\u2019s left of the sofa and stare at that TV and get the feeling you knew the people who lived there once. Run your thumb over the dials on the toaster, the handle of the fridge, or the yellowing plastic of a light switch, and feel an aching loss that creeps up on you out of nowhere.\n\nLook up and you\u2019ll see that the light fixture has been torn out of the ceiling, like someone had tried swinging from it.\n\nNot a big place, by the way. Three rooms. A bedroom with a double bed all rumpled up. A living room slash kitchen. And a tiny little spare room that looked like it once would have been used for storage, or a washing machine maybe, *if* you were single and childless. A slither of space, a triangle carved out of whatever room was left over when other more important walls had been put up. That sofa I mentioned, the TV, they were all placed so whoever was sat down could always keep an eye on that room and its contents.\n\nYou see they\u2019d put a cot inside and it\u2019s still there, bluebottle flies circling overhead. You can\u2019t see inside the cot, not unless you went in and actually pulled the blankets out but it\u2019s been decades and no one has managed it yet. It\u2019s dark behind those old blankets, a heavy shadow that dissuades a closer look, like there\u2019s something in there no one needs to see and it\u2019s spent a long time sat there eating what little light there was. Even with a window in that room, daylight doesn\u2019t really filter down.\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d the businessman said when he saw it. He gazed around the flat one detail at a time, his head pausing for a moment and a smile creeping across his face as he laid his eyes on the broken light fixture. And the cot, the sight of it, the flies that still circled above faded Winnie the Pooh blankets, it made the breath catch in his throat.\n\n\u201cOh this is\u2026 *yes* this is good,\u201d he told me. \u201cDark like under the bed. You\u2019ve earned that money. I could have had a dozen men sweep this place and they wouldn\u2019t have understood the brief as well as you have.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I replied even if that wasn\u2019t really how I felt.\n\nQuietly the man sat down and began to unpack his leather satchel. No pentagrams to be found, although he did unpack seven strange looking candles. He caught me looking at them and smiled.\n\n\u201cHome made,\u201d he said. \u201cEach one shaped by my hands. I\u2019m not a good artist, but it\u2019s the effort that counts. Took forever to rend the wax. Of course that was the easy part. The hard part was getting the fat to make it. Did you know there can be a surprisingly high level of security around a hospital\u2019s medical waste department?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d I replied as he took out some flimsy bits of wood and a few small nails. He oh so carefully began to nail the splinters of wood together into what looked like random shapes.\n\n\u201cOh well,\u201d he sighed after a few quiet moments, his fingers nimbly gripping the tiny hammer as he tapped away. Already he\u2019d put together at least six of the strange little wooden polygons, and with each new one I felt a strange sensation. \u201cWould you like to stay and watch?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d I answered.\n\nHe stopped tapping and smiled once more.\n\n\u201cOh you\u2019re clever,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the correct answer, by the way. And if I\u2019m to respect it, I should inform you that now is the safest time to leave.\u201d\n\nI made my way to the exit just as he lit the first candles, but not before I looked towards the cot one last time. I was surprised to see a hollow blackness that extended beyond the doorway, like a curtain had been draped across it, only there was depth to it that drew the eye. The businessman paid it no attention, but after a few more seconds he eventually looked up at me expectantly.\n\n\u201cCan I ask what is it you want?\u201d I said. \u201cEveryone who comes here, I don\u2019t get the sense it ever works out for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for a new kind of afterlife,\u201d he replied.\n\n\u201cDo you need one?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all need one,\u201d he said with a wry chuckle. \u201cBut only those of us willing to take a few risks will get a better deal. Everyone else\u2026\u201d He grimaced. \u201cIt\u2019s worth the bother. But look who I\u2019m speaking to.\u201d\n\nHe looked to the darkness that enveloped the doorway. Shapes could be seen floating past.\n\n\u201cYou should leave now,\u201d he said.\n\nI pulled the door shut and, noticing that the sun was rapidly setting, ran to my apartment where I knew the walls would keep me safe.\n\nWhen I returned the next day the man\u2019s satchel was still where I\u2019d last seen it, propped against one arm of the sofa. The candles had burned down to the very end of the wicks and left a lingering smell that\u2019s still there all these years later. And of the man himself, well in the room with the cot\u2014which still has bluebottle flies orbiting overhead\u2014there is now a shadow burned into the wall. It\u2019s blurry and diffused, but vaguely recognisable as a man on his knees, his head pressed to the floor in a gesture of supplication.\n\nI\u2019ve known it to occasionally move, to turn its head and look towards me at which my point my temples throb, my ears pop, and a darkness begins to encroach upon the edges of my vision. I never exactly considered that flat to be Disneyland before, but now I avoid it like the plague.\n\nStill, it could be worse. Not every ritual ends so cleanly and at times I\u2019ve had to personally intervene, something I hate bitterly. If people want to go poking around in the universe\u2019s undercarriage that\u2019s their business. It\u2019s one thing if I\u2019ve got to sweep what\u2019s left of them up afterwards but at least that\u2019s a one and done job. Sometimes it isn\u2019t so clean. One guy turned up and told me he\u2019d be a new \u201cresident\u201d, my neighbour, and we\u2019d get to know each other. A bumbling old man with an upper class accent and the look of a professor who was down on his luck. He set up in the room next to mine and no matter how little I spoke to him, he never really got the hint and kept trying to act like a good friend. Few times I did initiate conversation it was to tell him the place he\u2019d chosen didn\u2019t have much in the way of protection. He pointed to some funny little rashes and told me *they* were his protection.\n\nOver the next few weeks I\u2019d bump into him from time to time, always on his hands and knees, scraping some dank corner or mouldy pile of bumpy growths. He collected fungi, told me on the first day, and I\u2019d often see him wiping his samples onto petri dishes that he whispered quiet words to whenever he thought I wasn\u2019t around. I don\u2019t think he was sane, but he probably wasn\u2019t completely barmy because he lived long enough to get a sense of Annedale and only come out in the day. Meanwhile his apartment filled up with a growing collection of chittering terrariums and pickle jars, their specimens hidden by murky fluids. All over, he planted and cultivated strange mushrooms and moulds. Encouraged them to soak up the darkness of Annedale and set them to grow in the rife conditions he\u2019d cultivated.\n\nTowards the end his living room had mushrooms growing out the walls. Plaster crumbling beneath microbial armies until there was only concrete and rebar, and even then mould continued to grow and thrive. A few times I peered in and found him feeding meat to the frilly growths that exploded out of the old furniture. During this time the symbols on our shared wall would often grow hot, and I found myself having to replace them on a nearly daily basis as he tinkered away on the other side. I asked him once or twice to tone it down.\n\n\u201cThis is important work,\u201d he growled, an unseen darkness creeping into his voice. \u201cI\u2019m not some ditzy crackhead trying to summon the Baphomet! I\u2019m not looking to get *high*. This is science. Progress! That is what I am working towards.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah well your progress is trying to eat its way into my flat. Can you ask it to stop?\u201d\n\nHe stopped, froze in mid gesture like I\u2019d said something either profoundly stupid or insightful, or likely a bit of both. He looked at the rashes on his arms that had, by now, started to sprout some of their own strange fruit. When he finally spoke again it was sly, like a lecherous old man propositioning a nurse.\n\n\u201cThis fungi,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had samples of it in the university for thirty years! Can you imagine? They never even realised what they had until I found it and unlocked its potential. Now I\u2019ve finally found the source and I can do things no one else thought possible. This entire time my thesis has depended upon the idea that the fungus has\u2026 a capacity for information processing way beyond anything we\u2019ve considered before. And your idea is a good one, you know? Asking it just might be an option\u2026\u201d\n\nHe scuttled off without another word and for the next few days he set about the building like a furious little honey bee in Spring. Poking and prodding, setting trap after trap and cleaning them vigorously of any rats or mice he caught. When I did my morning sweeps I\u2019d find him hovering over Annedale\u2019s latest victims, scraping what was left of them into transparent bags for his own purposes.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind me,\u201d he\u2019d mutter. \u201cIt\u2019s worthless to you, but these poor souls could help me achieve great things.\u201d\n\nThis persisted for another month. He no longer scraped mould or mushrooms off old apartments. He became interested only in meat, and by the time it came to an end I can say confidently that I have never smelled anything worse than the prickly musty odour that wafter out from under his locked door. It became so bad that I began to wonder if I might have to ask for police help and have him removed when, finally, he simply disappeared from Annedale\u2019s halls. One morning he was there, annoyingly shooing me out of the way as he lowered jars into the flooded basement, and then the next he was gone and Annedale\u2019s halls were silent once more.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t mean he had moved out. Far from it, actually.\n\nIt took two days before I decided to just go ahead and break his door down. I kicked at it with a short sharp blow only to find my leg immediately disappeared through wood that had the texture of sodden cardboard. I freed my foot and tried a different tactic, grabbing the handle and pulling so hard that it simply *popped* right out of the rancid wooden frame. Free to move, the door swung open with an eerie creak and fetid air, hot and damp, blew out of the room.\n\nInside I found that the man\u2019s specimens had gone wild. Terrariums had shattered, their contents spilling outwards. Frogs as large as footballs glared at me from behind furry fronds, and insects with human eyes scuttled away before the amphibians could snatch them up. In one corner rats had built a hive out of old cardboard, their backs covered with fungal growths that resembled human fingers and other appendages. In another corner something that looked a little like a black rubber sheet slapped furiously at passing vermin and it took me a few seconds to realise it was a slime mould. When it finally caught something it dragged the strange creature squealing into the dark corner where it grew and constricted around its meal like a fist. I stared at it horrified until one by one black orbs unveiled itself from within the strange mass and I realised it had eyes to stare right back at me.\n\nIt was a cacophony of God awful terror, so gripping that it kept me from hearing the muffled noise of a human struggling to speak. Eventually it did reach my ears and I used my torch to light up the far wall without having to actually step inside.\n\nI found the scientist half-grown into the wall. Algae and moss coated him head-to-toe so that he was no longer recognisable, but I had to assume it could be no one else. Wide eyes glared at me with terror and pain as nasty little critters nibbled away at what was left of his shins, meanwhile strange tendrils probed at his ears and head, never resting for a moment. He kept trying to speak, but the algal growths kept driving their way into his mouth until, one-by-one, they pushed too far and something snapped. His eyes went wider still, his squeals became hysterical, and his jaw slowly slid further down his chest until it hit the floor with a sodden thump.\n\n\u201cFinally made contact?\u201d I asked. \u201cAn awful idea if I\u2019ve heard one. What would a mushroom have to say even in the best of circumstances? Let alone one that was grown in the ruins of Annedale? I can only assume you never got around to telling it to stay off my wall, did you? No you probably had your own reason or doing all of this and that\u2019s what took priority.\u201d\n\nThat made me wonder what it was he\u2019d asked for. As the thought entered my head I took a quick look around and tried to see if anything particular stood out to me. Something was growing on the sofa that looked strangely human-shaped. It might have been just my imagination, but in the dark it seemed to turn towards me. Meanwhile the scientist continued to shiver in agony, his eyes focused on me and begging for help.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do,\u201d I said before slamming the door. Something about that strange pile on the sofa had deeply unsettled me.\n\nI put the word out, asked for a gun, but got a crossbow instead a few days later. A nervous looking sixteen year old boy ferried it to my door. I was surprised he\u2019d entered the building, but who knows who\u2019d ordered him to do so. I\u2019ve acquired a strange sort of respect amongst the locals and it comes in handy. This boy looked like he would have stamped on my head and robbed me blind any other day, but when he spoke to me he did so with more respect than I ever imagined I deserved. I thanked him, took the crossbow, spent an afternoon practicing with it, and then used it to kill the scientist the next morning.\n\nTook a few hits, but in the end one thumped into his forehead and shut down his whimpered moans. I didn\u2019t see anything on the sofa this time, at least not anything human-shaped, which I was thankful for. After that it was a simple case of calling the police and beginning a long chain of events that ended with half-a-dozen men in hazmat suits spraying the room with noxious chemicals. For a while there I\u2019d been worried that they\u2019d find a corpse and ask questions, but by the time anyone actually entered the room there was nothing left of the scientist save a splotch on the floor.\n\nI never did figure out exactly what it was he was after, although it is not uncommon for my morning sweep to turn up a body (or part of) covered in fungal growths. And I have been known to occasionally catch glimpses of a strange person lowering themselves into the floodwater of the elevator shaft. Of course I might just be making connections that aren\u2019t really there. All sorts of things live in that water. The entire level is flooded and if something was down there, it\u2019d have free reign over quite a large space.\n\nIt's a strange world down there. I should know on account of one visitor who gave me a very bad time. I\u2019ll call him the fisherman since he came to Annedale because of the flooded basement. Saw a photo that\u2019s been circulating around for a while now, if you know where to look. God knows who took it and how, but it shows the flooded stairwell leading to the basement and beneath the brackish surface is a hand that\u2019s all out of proportion. Fingers splayed with perfect symmetry like a starfish, it is reaching up out of the depths and resting gently on the third step below the water.\n\nWhen I first met him he was sitting happily with his feet over the edge of the flooded shaft, water up to his knees, with a rod and line set up beside him. It was quite a surprise at first, seeing him there with a little fly-fishing hat. A chubby but healthy looking man in his forties with an egg mayo sandwich in one hand and a phone playing candy crush in the other. I called out to him as I approached because, in my experience, startling someone in Annedale is bad for your health no matter how sane the visitor appears.\n\nHe looked up when I caught his attention and smiled amiably.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d he waved with his sandwich. \u201cYou\u2019re the caretaker?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I am,\u201d I answered. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a tourist,\u201d he smiled. \u201cCare to join me?\u201d\n\nThe sun had risen only moments ago.\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t here when it was dark, were you?\u201d I asked more than a little suspicious.\n\n\u201cOh no you\u2019ve only just caught me, been here barely ten minutes before you showed up. I was told you\u2019d be willing to help in exchange for a small fee.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sort of help?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cOh just give me a nudge if any of the lines start moving,\u201d he said while pointing to a rod he\u2019d set up beside the basement stairs. The door was propped open and the line led down into the darkness below, water gently lapping just out of sight. Another line had been set up in a corner of the lobby where the floor had been torn away revealing a hole straight down into the basement. \u201cI can\u2019t keep an eye on them all at once, you see. I have bells ready but, well, two heads are better than one.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it exactly you\u2019re hoping to catch down there?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cAre you familiar with the primordial ocean?\u201d he said. \u201cThe abyssal waters that God split into light and dark, all that? It\u2019s not a physical location, per se, but it does connect to certain bodies of water depending on the time and place. Last recorded manifestation was in a glass of old whiskey underneath a forgotten bar in Mexico City. Some poor fellow knocked it over and didn\u2019t notice until the following day when half the bar was suddenly underwater. Quickly rectified but some of the things swimming in that water were something else, and all from at the bottom of a glass no wider than my wrist. Imagine what we can do with this!?\u201d he said while gesturing at water by his feet.\n\n\u201cYou think there could be fish alive down there?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cAt least,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019d be willing to pay for any reliable information, of course. Do you have any idea what might be down there?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d I shrugged. \u201cBut I\u2019d guess it wants to be left alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmmm you might be right there,\u201d he said while looking at his other rods. \u201cI didn\u2019t exactly put down any old lure, you know?\u201d\n\nHe reached into his pocket and took out a strange tuft of fur and ivory, holding it up for me to squint at.\n\n\u201cA tooth from a man who drowned in the sea. A drone collected it off a shipwreck near the Norwegian coast. The fur is actually red algae that was found growing on his bones. I have plenty of these and, well, other things that might appeal to what\u2019s on the other side. My research was thorough and expensive. Come on, take a seat. Flat fee, one thousand, just sit here until the sun starts to set.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just have to sit?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cAnd let me know if you hear or see anything.\u201d\n\nI groaned and sat beside him, folding my legs instead of letting them dangle in the water below. Despite my reticence, we stayed like that for several hours. He\u2019d brought lots of food, good homemade stuff, along with plenty of cold beer. We sat there and spoke very little, but we did eat and drink a tremendous amount. Not the kind of thing I do normally, but I was being paid to be there, and I didn\u2019t really have anywhere else to be. It was, all in told, a very pleasant afternoon.\n\nUntil I fell asleep.\n\nWhen I awoke it was with a terrible gasp. My chest was tight like something had been sitting on it, and judging from the terrible giggling and scampering feet I heard running off into the darkness, it might not have been *just* a feeling. Already panic was setting in as my eyes darted to the open doors and saw that the moon was out and had been for hours. I fumbled for my torch and turning it on saw that there was no sign of the fisherman. All his stuff had been left behind yet all that remained of him was his hat that still floated on the water. Even as I watched, a smooth glistening shape curled beneath the water and plucked it off the surface.\n\nI recoiled and crawled away from it as fast as I could. This was bad, I knew deep in my heart I\u2019d never been as at risk I was in that moment. The open doors that led outside were tempting, but just beside them were the stairs that led downwards and I swore I could hear something approaching. I couldn\u2019t help but picture the fungal man I\u2019d seen in the scientist\u2019s flat. Then again, that basement was huge and who knows what lay down there.\n\nI decided to go for the stairs. The entire time my heart was in my chest. I had never been caught outside my room at night, not since my first night when I\u2019d slept in the lobby with my coat pulled over me. You don\u2019t get lucky twice, not with Annedale, so I knew had to be careful. I had to be quiet. My only hope was to go unnoticed. I took to stealth, climbing each floor in perfect silence, hiding in well known spots at the slightest hint of footsteps, human or otherwise.\n\nAnnedale comes alive at night. Whispered mutterings from strange children who descend from air vents, living there for God knows how long. Other times I saw apparitions including one, a toddler, the sight of whom made my stomach growl with an insatiable hunger that hurt just to contemplate. She stared at me with pleading eyes as I slunk away from her open door. I might have been tempted to help her were it not for the sight of the moon peering through her translucent image.\n\nAnd yet, despite all this, I somehow made it to the fourteenth floor alive. Only it was there right at the final hurdle, so close to safety, that I came across something out of my worst nightmare.\n\nA woman stood outside my apartment door. Silent. Pale. Dirt covered fingernails. It was all too often I\u2019d open my door and find muddy impressions on the floor made by a woman\u2019s bare feet. Now I knew who left them every night. I couldn\u2019t see her face from where I hid, but something about her seemed profoundly familiar.\n\nWhen she finally turned towards me I remembered. I recognised her, even though most of her face was missing. It was the philosopher\u2019s wife. He had succeeded, it seemed. But I couldn\u2019t imagine at what God awful price, because the woman who stared at me had clearly weathered some years in the grave. It was only the poor lighting and her long hair that had covered up just how bad a state she was in. A lipless grin stared back at me below sunken cheekbones and hollow eye sockets. And yet, I could tell that in another life she had been beautiful which only made the sight all the more gut-wrenching.\n\n\u201cMy darling,\u201d she whispered, and there was something about her voice that I found hard to stay sane in the face of. I don\u2019t know why. Over a decade in that place and I\u2019d borne witness to living nightmares, but it was *this* walking corpse that pushed me to my limits. The inescapable feeling of loss weighed me down and without realising it I found myself taking steps towards her even as my knees buckled. By the time I reached her I was crawling until I could clutch her grimy icy leg, and that was the last thing I remember before I woke up in my bed the following morning.\n\nEverything seemed normal, so completely mundane that I could\u2019ve written the whole thing off as a bad nightmare. But there were footprints leading from my bed to the door. And later on I found the fisherman\u2019s things much as he left them, although when I finally reeled his lines in I found the lures gone and replaced with bits and pieces of the man who\u2019d first set them up. I threw it all into the water below and decided it would be best to forget him.\n\nEvery now and again, of course, I can\u2019t help but check my peephole at night. I never did before that, but now I do. I see her every single time. She looks sad. Hurts me to think of her out there. It ought to be terrifying but it\u2019s more like someone\u2019s ripped out my stomach and heart and let all my insides fall out the bottom.\n\nEach time I see her I wonder what exactly was it he did to bring her back?\n\nHe leaves only one hint. A final letter, I think. It\u2019s not like he dated them. In it he says he would give everything to have her in his arms once more. Not only his life, but everything he\u2019s already lived. Every sunset. Every good dream. Every nightmare. Every victory. Every loss. Every little memory that makes him who he is, he\u2019d give it all just to save her.\n\nSometimes I wonder about him, figuring we\u2019d probably be about the same age. I\u2019d like to think back and imagine what it would have been like for the two of us to meet as young men, but for some reason whenever I try to remember what my life was like before I came to this city, before I woke up with that coat pulled over me\u2026 well, I don\u2019t know\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s just hard, that\u2019s all.\n\nIt's almost like there's nothing there. Like something reached in and took all the years away. I guess it's just one of those things I'm better off not dwelling on.",

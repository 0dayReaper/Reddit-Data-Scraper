    "postText": "The abandoned building I looked at seemed to be bleeding. Looking down the street, I saw a few more stone structures, and they too had red fluid dripping down their dark granite. My friends and I backed off instinctively.\n\n\n\u201cMaybe it is just some type of sap,\u201d Amy said, running her hair through her fingers like she usually did when she was anxious. But then the wailing started, and we all looked at each other. I saw the same paleness and uncertainty on all of their faces that I felt inside my stomach.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that, a fishercat? A fox?\u201d James asked to my right, speaking quickly, his voice quavering. He was always the natural leader of our little expeditions, the one who did the research into abandoned sites or caves and encouraged everyone else to come along. But right now, he didn\u2019t look like much of a leader. His eyes were wide, his skin was pale and he was quickly looking around to the right and left. I knew how he felt.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s no fox,\u201d I said, feeling around in my pocket for my knife. The wailing seemed to come from all around us. It sounded like a woman being burned alive.\n\n\nThe fourth member of our group, Sarah, was the only one who seemed to not be in a state of mortal terror. She calmly looked at the blood dripping down the buildings, walking up to it and sticking her fingers into it, then smelling it. I thought for a moment she would taste it. Thankfully, she didn\u2019t. She wiped the blood off and turned to us.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, that is blood,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we need to get out of here.\u201d Her calmness seemed to bring the group back together for a moment, and we all looked at each other. I took out my knife. I looked over at the old church at the beginning of town, and saw with horror that it was absolutely covered in blood now. Every floorboard and wall and beam on it sweated the dripping, red fluid. It looked like a shimmering, flowing maze of dark crimson. It soaked the dirt and grass growing around it, dripping down from every surface.\n\n\n\u201cIf any of you have weapons,\u201d I said, \u201cit may be a good idea to take them out now. We don\u2019t know what is around us, but it is better safe than sorry.\u201d Sarah nodded in agreement, pulling out a keychain with mace on it. James had a boxcutter, and Amy had absolutely nothing, but she went to the side of the dirt road and picked up a thick stick.\n\n\nWe all started walking back to the car in a tightly-clustered circle. The hike would take at least forty-five minutes, even if we hurried and didn\u2019t get lost. We had to follow the red trail until it intersected with the green trail. The green trail would lead directly back to the dirt parking lot where we had parked. I would be ecstatic to see those little green markers.\n\n\nThe wailing never stopped, but seemed instead to follow us. Silvery eyes looked out at us from the mist, but whenever I turned my head to look directly at them, they were gone. They moved so quick, I wondered whether maybe I was just hallucinating them.\n\n\nJames was in the back of our little circle, and I was at the front. I heard a quick commotion from behind me, but by the time we all turned to look, he was gone. It couldn\u2019t have taken more than a fraction of a second for us to look back. \n\n\nThe thick fog on both sides of us obscured sight. We heard a deep, terrified, low scream, but it was cut off in the middle with a horrible gurgling choking noise, and we were plunged into silence. The wailing had stopped.\n\n\n\u201cJames?\u201d I yelled, trying to discern where the scream had come from. There was no reply.\n\n\n\n\n \\* * *\n\n\n\n\nThroughout history, there have been countless unsolved disappearances of towns or groups of people: the Mayan city of Tikal, the English colony of Roanoke, the entire Roman 9th Legion, the Eskimo village of Anjikuni Lake and many others. One of the most bizarre and least well-known occurred near where I grew up.\n\n\nSources from a few centuries ago told of a bustling community of loggers and fur-trappers who had a small hamlet deep in the forests they called \u201cNorth Windshire\u201d. It consisted mainly of one dirt road with buildings on each side of it. But it had a church, a tavern, a blacksmith, a barber-surgeon, and a few other functioning establishments. The people who lived there were, by all accounts, peaceful and hard-working. The fact that all of them disappeared one night without any sign of a struggle confounded locals, and to this day, no one has discovered any conclusive evidence as to what happened to the townspeople. Explanations ranged from a sudden epidemic to hostile Native American tribes. \n\n\nA few of my friends and I went out urban exploring and cave exploring, and we knew we needed to see this place. James had brought it up, texting everyone about it, and then Amy went to the local library and found anything and everything she could about North Windshire.\n\n\nBy the next day at around 4 PM, four of us were driving out there. The thick fog of early spring covered the endless forests. We nearly missed the single dirt road leading off to North Windshire, but luckily Sarah\u2019s eagle-eyes saw the faded marker just as we drove past. It got dark around 5:30 but since the hike was only estimated to take thirty minutes each way, I figured we had plenty of time.\n\n\nThe walk into North Windshire was beautiful and peaceful. We complained about our jobs, discussed other abandoned sites and caves we might explore, griped about politics, and drank a couple beers. By the time we reached the outer limits of the town, I was in a good mood, happy to be with friends and explore somewhere new.\n\n\nBut as we entered the first building in the town, an ancient-looking church with the doors busted off and animal droppings all over the floor, an eerie feeling had fallen over me. I could see it was affecting the rest of the group as well. No one wanted to be the first to speak about it, however, not after we had driven an hour just to see this old ghost-town.\n\n\nYet when I was inside the church, I could have sworn I saw silver eyes, looking in through the broken windows. There was a feeling of immense power in the church, a feeling of something ancient and inhuman watching us. And a slight smell of sulfur seemed to cover the entire town, mixing with the smell of fog and pine trees that pervaded the forests.\n\n\n\n\n\\* * *\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere could he have gone?\u201d Amy asked. She was in clear panic mode. Sarah and I tried to calm her down.\n\n\n\u201cWe need to get out of here, so we can call for help,\u201d I said. Sarah shook her head.\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just leave James and you know it,\u201d Sarah said, still maddeningly calm about the whole thing. \u201cWe have to go look for him. What if that was you? Would you want us to hike out of here and call the police? It could take a few hours before they get here and start searching, and if he is in danger\u2026\u201d I sighed. She was right.\n\n\nI didn\u2019t want to mention that choking sound that had cut off his screaming, however. It sounded like something was ripping his throat out. And if that was the case, there was nothing we could do by searching. Luckily, Amy brought it up instead.\n\n\n\u201cIt sounded like he was choking,\u201d Amy said, tears starting to fall down her cheeks. \u201cWhat if he got attacked by a bear or a mountain lion? What if it ripped his throat out? What if by looking for him, we all get attacked too?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cSarah is right, though I hate to admit it,\u201d I said. \u201cEven if he did get attacked, he might still be alive. We might be able to help him.\u201d We heard scuffling from our left. I had my knife pointed out in that direction. For a keychain knife, it was rather long and strong, made from Damascus steel and longer than the palm of my hand. With shaking hands, I took the key ring and keys off and slid them in my pockets, so the knife wouldn\u2019t jangle every time I moved. Amy had her thick tree branch ready. The figure broke through the fog suddenly, on the ground and dragging itself forward, and Amy and I both let out a short scream.\n\n\nMy first thought was that it was a zombie, but I quickly realized that wasn\u2019t really true. It had a smell of sulfur, disintegration and feces emanating from it, a smell that made me want to gag and cover my face. But I didn\u2019t dare put my hands up. \n\n\nThough it had no legs, it moved deceptively fast. It veered towards Amy, who was holding her branch like a baseball bat. She swung the huge thing as fast as she could, knocking the wood into the side of the creature\u2019s head with a massive crack. Its head whipped to the side, its open drooling mouth biting off a piece of its own tongue in the commotion. The tip of its tongue, a dark brown, rotten thing, fell off into the dirt. Its cracked black teeth smashed together, pieces of them shattering. \n\n\nYet within seconds, it had turned its head back towards us, and started forward again. Amy quickly backpedaled as I ran forward, stabbing the knife through the side of its neck. With a strong grip, I pulled the knife handle back towards myself, opening up the creature\u2019s throat with a single motion. It opened its mouth in a silent scream, but no blood came out. Instead, white light began to seep out of it. It looked like a thin shimmering mist, which at first dripped slowly out of the creature\u2019s wounds and then began to run faster and faster. The light twisted back towards the abandoned town, forming a spiraling tunnel as it veered down the path. The strange creature had lost the glow of its eyes now. It just lay there on the ground, kneeling on its stumps. Its rotting, filmy eyes slowly started to close. It fell forwards, landing at Amy\u2019s feet.\n\n\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d Amy said slowly. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d I shrugged calmly, but inside I was just as terrified as her. I could feel my hands trembling badly. I tried clasping them together, holding the knife between them, taking deep meditative breaths in an attempt to stop the trembling. After a few seconds, it seemed to recede slightly.\n\n\n\u201cI think whatever it is, it is connected with that church,\u201d Sarah said. She still seemed maddeningly calm about the situation. I wanted to shake her and ask her if she understood how close to death she was right now. And then she looked at me. \u201cYou lead the way, Dean.\u201d I nodded. \n\n\n\u201cWe need to get as far away from the church as we can, I think,\u201d I said. I started walking down the trail, and they followed close behind. I could practically feel Amy breathing down the back of my neck.\n\n\nWe made good time on the trail. We each had flashlights on our phones. Even though we had no service, the presence of the phones and the bright LED lights they provided made me feel quite a bit better. It seemed to connect me back to the real world, a place of technology and 911 and science, rather than this trail of silver eyes and bleeding churches.\n\n\nBut after hiking for forty-five minutes, I knew there was a problem. The hike was only supposed to take thirty minutes each way. Going in, we hiked the green trail for about ten minutes, which intersected with the red trail. We had only had to hike about twenty minutes on the red trail to reach the town. We had stayed in the town longer than we should have, and it had gotten dark, but since the trails were clearly marked and we had lights on our phones, I hadn\u2019t been worried.\n\n\nNow I was extremely worried. It would have been nearly impossible to miss the sign and the big green marker on the intersection of the trails, even at nighttime. I knew we hadn\u2019t passed it. It seemed impossible. And none of us wanted to break the silence. Eventually, however, I did. I turned around.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re lost,\u201d I said simply. Sarah and Amy shook their heads.\n\n\n\u201cDo you think we should turn back around?\u201d Amy asked, nervous. Her eyes flitted from me to Sarah rapidly.\n\n\n\u201cAnd do what?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt just leads back to the church. We\u2019re trying to get\u2026\u201d Sarah interrupted me, pointing suddenly.\n\n\n\u201cUh, guys?\u201d Sarah said. I turned around so fast I almost fell over. I saw where she was pointing with her cellphone light, and I wanted to start crying.\n\n\nIt was the church. We had somehow done a full circle and came back to the abandoned ghost town. This was, of course, geographically impossible. The red trail did not circle back around. It continued in a relatively straight line to the east. And yet here we were, back where we started in the pitch-black night. Then the singing started.\n\n\nIt reminded me of a church hymn, but it was eerie, off-note, slowed. It was like a church hymn from a bad acid trip. And as I saw lines of silver eyes walking down the street, I realized where it was coming from.\n\n\n\u201cQuick, around back,\u201d I whispered, pointing to the church. We sprinted around the building, hiding behind it, though careful not to touch the exterior itself, which still swam with blood. Sarah and I poked our heads out to watch, while Amy hyperventilated, hugging her branch to her chest, looking into the dark bushes suspiciously. We had all turned off our lights by this point, but the moon gave off a little light- enough to see vague silhouettes, anyway.\n\n\nThe smell of the creatures walking down this eerie, abandoned street was overwhelming. The smell of blood from the buildings mixed in with the rotting, sulfurous reek that now overpowered us. I saw many of them had pieces of their faces, arms and legs missing, as if a leper colony were marching past us. But no blood ran from these wounds, and the light in their eyes seemed to come from within their bodies. They weren\u2019t simply reflecting the moonlight, but emanating some dead light from within themselves. It was disquieting.\n\n\nWhen I turned to look away, I realized Amy was gone. I shook Sarah quickly, who seemed to come out of a trance.\n\n\n\u201cAmy,\u201d I said simply, pointing. She turned, and her eyes went wide.\n\n\n\u201cWhere the fuck is she?\u201d she said through gritted teeth. I tried squinting into the bushes, but it was too dark to see anything. I swore under my breath. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need the lights, Dean.\u201d I nodded, though a pit of dread formed in my stomach as she spoke the words. If those things in the road saw our lights\u2026\n\n\nShe turned her light on, covering most of it with her hand to try to make the beam smaller and less noticeable. Her mouth opened in a silent scream, and she nearly dropped the phone.\n\n\nI looked down, following her gaze. Ten feet into the bushes, we saw Amy. Her head was on backwards, her neck snapped, the skin stretched into a tight circle. Her mouth was still open in horror, her eyes wide and unseeing.\n\n\n\u201cOh God,\u201d Sarah said, and for the first time, I saw her calm, cold demeanor shatter. She was breathing fast, bent over, repeating those words: \u201cOh God, oh God, oh God, oh God\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d I said, taking her hand gently. I covered her light up with my palm, then turned on the screen and turned it off. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be OK.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fucking lie to me with that bullshit,\u201d she whispered angrily. \u201cWe are definitely not going to be OK. Do you see her? Look at what they did to her.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t give up hope,\u201d I said. \u201cWe need a plan.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOur plan should be to burn that fucking church down and kill all those bastards,\u201d she whispered. I nodded.\n\n\n\u201cI like it,\u201d I said simply. \u201cThat is a great plan.\u201d I peeked back from around the corner, trying to see if the creatures with the glowing eyes had gone away, and to my horror, I saw one of them standing inches away, watching us and grinning from ear to ear. It showed off blackened teeth and squirming brown gums in its Cheshire cat grin. I involuntarily yelped and stumbled back, falling over a branch, dropping my knife and phone when I hit the ground.\n\n\nBehind that one stood dozens more, all smiling wide, watching Sarah and me with their dead, glowing eyes. I began to fumble in a panic on the ground, looking for my knife and phone. I found my knife, but my phone was nowhere that I could see. For a moment, time seemed to stop, all of us frozen like statues, the creatures smiling with insane expressions on their decomposing faces. Sarah flicked her mace to the firing position and began shooting it at the creatures\u2019 faces.\n\n\nAt first, nothing happened. Then a bellow of rage began. Each of them that had been hit began to mutter. It didn\u2019t sound like words at first, but it grew louder and more angry with every passing second, until it turned into a shriek. All of their grinning mouths turned to open, furious screams. They began to run forwards. I was out of time. Grabbing my knife and leaving my phone, I got up, sprinting into the forest.\n\n\nSarah wasn\u2019t so fast. By the time she had turned to flee, their dead, rotting hands had already grasped her. Her screams of pain followed me out into the darkness, echoing and growing more animalistic. Then they were cut off, and I was alone.\n\n\nI ran in a straight line for a few minutes, cutting myself open on prickers and falling over branches and smashing my knees on tree trunks. I was battered, bloody and hurting. Eventually, I found a huge rock with a small opening underneath it. I crawled under it, hiding, thinking. Sarah\u2019s words came back to me: \u201cOur plan should be to burn that fucking church down.\u201d Hell, they were her last words, her dying wish.\n\n\nEventually, I crawled back out. Feeling in my pockets, I found a lighter. I limped painfully back towards the abandoned town, back towards the church and all those murderous creatures who called it home. As I got close, I could hear those eerie hymns stretching out through the forest, distorting and echoing. I crawled to the back window, and what I saw there will give me nightmares for the rest of my life.\n\n\nThey had the bodies of Amy, Sarah and James crucified against the front wall. A figure in a black robe was cutting out pieces of their bodies and feeding them to the congregation. One by one, the creatures with the glowing eyes would go up to the front, where the robed figure would use a knife to rip off a piece of skin or muscle from the dead body and feed it to the open, rotting mouth of the kneeling creature. They all lined up, and soon, the bodies of my friends were skinned, the bones and organs showing as they mutilated each body and fed them to the crowd.\n\n\nI felt like throwing up. I backed away from the church quickly, trying to form a plan. I stumbled around, looking for a thick branch. I found the one Amy had been holding behind the church. Next to it, I saw Sarah\u2019s can of police mace. Grabbing both, I snuck back up front and shoved it through the handles of the church door as quietly as I could.\n\n\nI started a fire in the town, destroying the church first. The weather was dry, and it was fairly easy to get it started. I used dry leaves and twigs, piling them up in the corner of the building and lighting a few leaves to get them started. The fog was thicker than ever, and the darkness was starting to come in. I could only hope someone would still be able to find me.\n\n\nI let the fire spread, starting new ones at each of the buildings I passed. Hissing and whispering came from the shadows all around me. I used Amy\u2019s mace to stop one of the crawling, biting creatures, who had only one leg and was dragging himself around, leaving trails of blood behind him. As the flames grew higher, more creatures came out, and soon I had to abandon the town entirely. But they were following me closely.\n\n\nI sprinted down the trail, continuously looking back. Silver eyes glinted in the night. I was grabbed from the bushes and trees repeatedly, rotten hands shooting out to stop me from escaping. The hands were cold, and the skin felt loose on them. It was as if in the process of decay, the flesh had started to separate from the bones. When I ripped free of the last one, most of the skin came with it, revealing brown, fetid muscles underneath squirming with worms and insects.\n\n\nBut looking back into the forest, I could see flames high in the sky now. I knew it would only be a matter of time. I sat on the trail, a knife in one hand and the can of mace in the other, and waited. Soon, I heard voices- human voices. They were coming from farther down the trail. Seconds later, I caught my first glimpses of firefighters in reflective suits. I started shouting and waving my hands. Weak, dehydrated and terrified, I was quickly ushered out of there. They brought me further down, and I realized the branch of the trail that led back to civilization was here again. I nearly cried in relief when I saw those green markers along it.\n\n\nFinally, I had broken the loop. With help, I made my way to safety- the sole survivor of a trip to Hell.",

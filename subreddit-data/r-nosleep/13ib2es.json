    "postText": "Since the [beach incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13heih5/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) yesterday, Kit Sutton has shut down completely. I've been trying to get her to share the full story, but thus far, I haven't been successful. She's been dropping hints here and there, but it all adds up to nothing. I cannot make heads or tails of it. (That is the saying, right?)\n\nNettie Peterson went to the doctor to get checked out, claiming she got into a bar brawl. She's alright physically, even though she's still a bit unnerved. I'm just glad that she's somewhat used to high strangeness and this is not her initiation to non-humans. Not like Eli. I think my back tentacles more or less broke the poor guy. Nettie hasn't heard from him since he drove her home. \n\nKit has locked herself up in her room. I made her some pancakes because they're the only food that I could slide underneath her door. I then tried to settle down and simply leave her be for a while. It was difficult; curiosity and worry were gnawing away at me every second I spent sitting on the sofa clicking through job offerings. I was in dire need of a distraction. Weirdly enough, just as I was thinking that, I got a text on my phone. The waiter. The pinpricks returned.\n\n***\"Are you free later?\"***\n\n*\"Yes,\"* I replied.\n\n***\"Wanna do something together?\"***\n\n*\"Yes.\"*\n\n***\"Six p.m., bring a swimsuit. I'll pick you up.\"***\n\n*\"I can't swim.\"*\n\n***\"I can teach you. Or we can stay in the kiddie pool. Sound good?\"***\n\n*\"Yes.\"*\n\nHe sent another smiley. And I don't know what drove me but I responded with a heart. The regret was instant; I may wear my regard for him on my sleeve but I've been told there is such a thing as being too direct. \"Kit?\" I hollered, getting up to bang on her door. \"How do you delete a text?\"\n\nNo response.\n\n\"Please?\"\n\nA muffled groan. \"Just own it,\" my roommate slurred, her voice barely audible.\n\nI stared at the door for a beat. \"You're inebriated.\"\n\n\"Leame 'lone. Just\u2026 y'know\u2026 okay?\"\n\nI sighed, forcibly restraining myself. *Give her space.* A glance at my phone screen told me that it was too late anyways. The server had sent me back a little yellow sun. I packed a bag with my swimsuit and other bathing necessities and then proceeded to kill time with menial tasks. I made Kit some more pancakes and let her know I would be going out. \n\n\"With creepy angel hair?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, refraining from commenting.\n\n\"Have fun, then,\" my roommate mumbled from behind the door.\n\nWhen the doorbell rang at six p.m. on the spot, I grabbed my bag and hurried down the stairs. The waiter was staring up the plain slab of concrete that was the outside of our building, his head tipped back. Upon taking note of me, his expression turned from one of mild disgust to satisfaction. \"Rustic,\" he commented after popping the bubble he'd blown from his gum. \n\n\"No. No, just ugly,\" I contradicted. \n\n\"Good. Because rustic was about the only term I could come up with to whitewash this dump.\" He tilted his head at the crumbly wall. \"Which should *literally* be whitewashed. Ready, sunshine?\"\n\nHe drove a modern, smaller type of station wagon that looked far too clean to be used on a regular basis. It was just as pristine from the inside. There was not a single stray item lying around anywhere, not a single hair on the seats, no dirt on the mat in the footwell area. I opened the glove compartment to find a box of chewing gum, an unopened carton of coconut water and a pair of gloves. \n\n\"The water's for you,\" the server said as he settled into the driver's seat. \"Since that's your most-placed order at the diner\u2026\"\n\nMy face felt warmer than before. \"Thanks. That's\u2026 thoughtful.\"\n\n\"Granted, I'll need a list of your nutritional requirements in the long run. I have no idea what your species likes to eat. Well, if we're opening that can of worms, I don't even know what you are.\"\n\n\"I don't know what I am.\" \n\n\"Or how to care for you?\"\n\n\"Not that, either.\"\n\n\"Oh goddamnit. I should have just listened to my coworkers and gotten a goldfish.\"\n\nI hid my grin behind my hand and averted my eyes when the server shot me a pleased look. After a short drive, we arrived at the local indoor pool. The waiter paid our entrance fee and we got changed, taking our towels with us as we headed out of the cabins. There weren't many other people there, just half a dozen senior citizens doing aqua aerobics in a corner by themselves. When we sat down by the edge of the water, I wordlessly held a bundle of yellow PVC out to him. \"Help me with these?\"\n\nHe snorted in disbelief. \"Arm floaties?\"\n\n\"I told you I couldn't swim.\"\n\nHe gave me a deadpan stare, his features still save for the steady movements of his jaw. \"You're telling me that the woman who snapped the neck of an armed man twice her size is afraid of a little water.\"\n\nI scoffed. \"I'm not afraid. But swimming is just\u2026 strange. How you can't feel yourself and you're suddenly\u2014\"\n\n\"Adrift? That's the greatest thing. Just let yourself go.\" He slid into the water with the same unmitigated grace he displayed when flitting from table to table. There were barely any splashes. \"Come on, I got you. You don't need the floaties.\"\n\nI frowned, staring down at the glistening surface. \n\nThe server smiled at me as the almost unnatural lights of the pool played on his golden curls, the droplets of water caught within them glittering. I sighed, pinched my nose and *dropped*. \n\nThe cold masses enveloped me in an instant. Darkness swallowed me as I pressed my eyes shut, the water pressing against my lids and drifting between my lashes. Panic was bubbling up inside of me until two hands came to rest on my shoulders, guiding me back to the surface. The touch was fleeting and barely even there, but it immediately soothed me. I bobbed back up to find the server beaming at me. \"You did it! You're in. Now you just gotta\u2026 what are you doing?\"\n\nI was moving my limbs rhythmically beneath my body to stay afloat. \"You look like a jellyfish!\" he laughed.\n\n\"Show me how it's really done, then,\" I growled. \n\n\"Okay. I'll hold you up and you just paddle with your hands and move your legs like a frog would.\"\n\nI huffed, but readily draped myself over his outstretched arms. I tried to do as he said, only to find it nothing short of exhausting. The pinpricks and the tightness of my chest weren't helping. \"I prefer my jellyfish technique,\" I grunted, turning around in his grip to look up at him. \n\n\"Then you're gonna have to live with me making fun of it,\" he replied. \"Though the joke would be on me in the end, wouldn't it? You could probably rip me apart if you wanted to.\"\n\n\"I don't want to,\" I told him earnestly. \"I can't imagine wanting to.\"\n\n\"You never think about\u2026 going on a rampage? Leaving this whole town in a bloodbath? I mean, you're powerful, I bet you could.\"\n\n\"No, I don't think about anything of the sort. Doesn't matter if I could. I don't do things just because I can,\" I replied.\n\n\"Maybe you should. Humans do.\" His left hand came up to support my back, his right one sliding into the crook of my knees. He lifted me further out of the water, holding me a little closer to his chest. \"Just something to ponder.\"\n\n\"Still no,\" I whispered against the lump that had formed in my throat. \n\n\"And that's okay, too. I'm sorry, I get so\u2026 negative. You *are* a ray of sunshine, and you should stay that way.\"\n\n\"When you carried me back to the car, was it kind of like this?\" I inquired.\n\n\"You were unconscious, so not quite. But yeah, this is how I\u2026\" His voice cracked when I reached up to play with his curls again. \"Was holding you. You have a thing for my hair, don't you?\"\n\n\"I just like it a lot.\"\n\n\"I don't. But it's nice that you do. I'm really so damned glad that you do.\"\n\nSomehow, that startled me. His voice just got so deep all of a sudden. The pinpricks were everywhere, my throat grew hot\u2014and then all the lights went off. The server looked up. \"What the\u2014\"\n\nThe large hall had fallen completely silent. Bathed in darkness, with not even the milky light of the moon that had formerly fallen in through the tall windows. I squinted at the walls to find that said windows had, in fact, disappeared entirely. There was nothing but a very dim glow illuminating the space. My heart was racing for completely different reasons now. The waiter gently loosened his grip and I slid down from his arms, the still waters welcoming me with a subdued splash. The sound rang out uncomfortably in the silence of the room. \"Hello?\" I called out. No response. \n\n\"Where did all the other people go?\" I muttered. \"We weren't alone here just a second ago\u2026 there were\u2026\"\n\n\"I know,\" the server replied quietly. \n\n\"This isn't right,\" I breathed, starkly reminded of the incident in the tube slide. \"No\u2026 no, no\u2026\"\n\n\"It'll be alright, sunshine. Don't panic, okay?\"\n\nI turned to look at my companion. Even now, his hair gave off a faint sheen reminiscent of a halo. I could make out the sparkle of his warm eyes a few inches below. \"We'll figure this out,\" he told me, sounding like he truly believed it. \"Here\u2026 get on my back. I'd rather be lugging you around than have you go under or something.\" He swam closer and I wrapped my legs around his midriff, loosely folding my arms around his shoulders. He began plowing through the water, surprisingly sure-footed. The pool seemed to have gotten a lot bigger\u2014I couldn't even see the edge from where we were anymore. \n\nAfter a minute or two, my carrier stopped abruptly. I considered slapping him on the behind, but I believe that only works on horses. \"What's wrong?\" \n\n\"I, uh, can't keep walking. There's, like, a drop. You can't see it, obviously, but I'm standing right at some sort of edge here. And it's steep, as in, *very* steep.\"\n\n\"Want me to get off so you can swim?\"\n\n\"I can carry you just fine.\" He bent over, gliding fully into the water with ease. I unhooked my legs, clinging to his back as he started dragging me along. \n\n\"You are weirdly okay with this,\" I observed.\n\n\"Eh. It's nothing. I'm a capable swimmer.\"\n\n\"I meant this whole changing places-situation. We're obviously not in the actual pool anymore.\"\n\n\"I'm optimistic. Sure, I'm crapping myself, but overall\u2026\" \n\nI heard the gnashing of his teeth against his chewing gum, more forceful than before. \"This is similar to something that's happened to me before, and I don't know why or what it means. And most importantly, I have no idea how to make it stop,\" I confessed, the words bubbling out of me in an almost incoherent string.\n\nThe waiter gave no response, he only reached up once to very briefly rest his hand over mine. Stroke by stroke, he carried us further out into the water. \"This place is just endless, isn't it.\" He was right\u2014there was still no solid ground anywhere in sight. I tipped my head back to look up at the ceiling. Its shape had changed. It wasn't a normal square room anymore, more like a rounded, warped dome covered in thousands of tiny, colorful tiles. I could see the unnatural glint bouncing off of them, creating an ever-shifting, ever-moving shimmer mirroring the ripples of the water's surface. It was nothing short of eerie.\n\n\"Here's a thought,\" the waiter began. \"I wonder how deep it is.\"\n\n\"I don't,\" I replied without missing a beat.\n\n\"Figures. Whatever's swimming beneath us is gonna get me first.\"\n\nI tightened my grip around him. \"There's something there?\" I asked, shriller than intended.\n\nThe server stayed silent for a moment. When he spoke up again, it was in a lower voice. \"I can feel something pushing the water around way below. I don't think it's moving upwards, so either it doesn't know we're here or it's uninterested. I sincerely hope it's the latter, but\u2026 we can't know for sure. So this has happened before?\" \n\n\"Yes, something like that.\"\n\n\"And how did you get back to the normal world?\"\n\n\"I really don't know,\" I confessed. \"I am so, so sorry\u2026\"\n\n\"What for? Not your fault.\"\n\nI remained silent for a whole minute before rasping out an answer. \"Don't you think it might be?\"\n\nIt took him a moment before he picked up on what I was saying. Even so, he seemed reluctant to respond. \"We've got more immediate concerns, sunshine. The thing is getting closer.\"\n\nThe suppressed note of dread swinging along in his tone made me wince. *Don't whine, don't even squeak\u2026* I bit my lip so hard I drew blood. Fear had seeped into my bones, now mingling with the constrictive feeling of more immediate panic. \"Do you think it's noticed us?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" he whispered. His arms continued to part the water in calm, tempered strokes, a stark contrast to the fear in his tone.\n\n\"Do you have any idea how big it is?\"\n\n\"*Big*,\" he murmured. \"Big enough for its movements to push me around up here, at least. It's kind of like swimming against a current.\"\n\nI felt my skin give way as my four tentacles breached my outer hull, slowly uncurling to hover behind my back. The waiter shifted slightly as he swam, craning his neck to look over his shoulder at me. His mouth briefly opened wide enough for me to glimpse his bubble gum. Then he kept swimming though, steadfastly moving further and further away from our previous position. \n\n\"It's following us,\" he told me under his breath. \"Coming closer, at any rate.\" And then, all of a sudden, he stopped. \"It just touched my leg,\" he whispered. \n\nIt took us both exactly half a second to realize what this meant. The creature had become aware of us. And it broke the surface mere moments later. Emerging from the unseen depths of the pool, it uttered a growl that sounded like multiple frequencies and volumes all at once. The sound bounced off the high walls, creating a bone-chilling echo. I let out a scream that was loud enough to compete with that of the monster. It was partly out of fear and partly a war-cry. The being had far too many limbs; dozens of thin, dripping tentacles swirling around its black, bag-like form. It reminded me of a gigantic, less translucent jellyfish. \n\nThree of its appendages came hurtling towards us, but I intercepted them by reaching out with my own. Mine were thicker, stronger, and I managed to bunch up the jelly-monster's tentacles and twist them around until they fell limp. This coaxed another cry from the creature, a distinctly agonized one. Another five instantly moved forth to replace the beast's broken limbs. They lashed out at us, swinging at me but missing when I ducked. Instead, they hit the waiter square across the chest before curling around him, tearing him out of the water and lifting him high into the air. He let out a strangled noise as it squeezed him. It rolled its tentacles around the man's body, its skin secreting a thick layer of slime that soon covered his torso and hair. He gagged, trying to wriggle out of the forceful embrace, but to no avail. \n\nA jolt went through me and I reached up, grabbing onto one of the monster's outstretched limbs. It instantly began trying to shake me off, but I continued to shimmy along its gooey appendage. Finally, I pulled myself up and, despite my immense disgust, opened my mouth and sank my teeth into its jelly-flesh. The stench hit me before the foul taste even registered. Both were similarly vomit inducing. The creature howled in pain and fury, but it dropped the waiter in favor of attempting to grab onto me instead. I batted its tentacles away with my own, simultaneously pushing myself off and instinctively reaching for the server's hand as I fell. I got ahold of it, our fingers intertwining, and through my panicked haze and my frenzied, racing thoughts, *I felt the pinpricks again.* \n\nFor a brief second, it was as if my brain was on fire. \n\nAll of a sudden, the room was brightly illuminated once more. We plummeted into clear, cool water, causing an enormous splash, droplets flying everywhere before raining back down on us as we bobbed up for air. We received a few annoyed grunts and angry looks from the aerobic-oldies. Apart from our attention-drawing reappearance, they hadn't seemed to notice anything. \n\n\"We're back,\" the server sputtered. \"We're actually back, I can't believe it\u2026 and you beat that thing's ass\u2026\"\n\n\"Not really.\"\n\n\"Yes! Yes, you did, and I\u2014huh. I seem to have swallowed my gum. That can't be good.\"\n\n\"My best friend says when you swallow a lot of gum it eventually clogs up your stomach and you won't be able to go to the toilet anymore.\"\n\nThe blond sighed. \"Sunshine, I don't think that's\u2026 nevermind. Wanna get out of here?\"\n\n\"Are you tired of the pool or do you want to get the gum that's in your car?\"\n\n\"A bit of both,\" he admitted gamely. \"Come on.\" He climbed out of the pool, then pulled me out after him. We gathered up our belongings and began our march back to the showers. I stole one more glance at him before he disappeared behind the hard blue door. \n\nThe ride home was quiet. We were both pretty exhausted and couldn't seem to muster up the energy to talk. Even so, the waiter didn't hesitate to get out with me and walk me to my door, unfortunately prompting the question of how to say goodbye to him. \n\n\"Listen, I get the feeling I ought to be afraid of you,\" he began, uncertainly pulling strings from his gum with his finger. I took a step back, regarding him with burning cheeks. \"But I'm not. And I had a good time tonight. I mean, yes, we probably hopped dimensions and nearly died but the rest was\u2026 nice.\"\n\n\"I thought it was nice, too,\" I supplied, unsure of what to say.\n\n\"So do I get to see you again? Sometime soon, maybe?\"\n\n\"Whenever,\" I replied, nodding eagerly. \"I still haven't found a new job, so I've got time. Albeit not much else.\"\n\n\"Your time's all I was going for,\" the server assured me, his smile soft and serene. He then leaned in and very briefly pulled me into a hug, releasing me before I got the chance to reciprocate. \"See you, sunshine.\"\n\nHe turned to leave, and by the time the following thought flashed through my head, he had already gotten back into his car. I looked after the retreating vehicle with knitted brows.\n\n*I couldn't remember ever giving him my address.*\n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13dr5g0/help_im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[2: deadbeat roommate](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13eovqy/im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_also_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[3: creepy crush](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13fnc4u/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_everyone/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[4: relocation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13gjpwd/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_does_anybody/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[5: beach concert](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13heih5/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[7: temp work](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ja7jx/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_temp_work/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

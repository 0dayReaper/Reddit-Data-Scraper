    "postText": "When my husband and I first got married and moved in together, we had a few fights. On personal space, on chores\u2026 and on d\u00e9cor.\n\nNamely, my husband insisted on keeping this weird painting of a woman.\n\n\u201cWho is she?\u201d I\u2019d asked when I first saw it, leaned against a mountain of moving boxes.\n\n\u201cDunno. Got it at a rummage sale.\u201d\n\nIt was an original painting. Oil, I think, judging by the way the light reflected off the brushstrokes. It depicted a young woman standing in a dark room, looking over her shoulder at the viewer. She was actually rather beautiful. Blonde hair falling over her shoulders like a waterfall. A white cotton dress. A dainty, heart-shaped face that was somehow haunting rather than cute.\n\nShe was illuminated brightly, but the room behind her was dark. The contrast and her pose reminded me a little bit of *Girl With A Pearl Earring*. But it didn\u2019t feel classy, or pensive, or beautiful. Instead it felt\u2026 creepy.\n\nEspecially because my husband insisted on hanging it above our bed.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s a beautiful painting,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it just doesn\u2019t fit with the modern d\u00e9cor.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither do your Funko Pops.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, but they\u2019re small. This painting is *enormous.* For Pete\u2019s sake, the woman is nearly life-sized!\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to keep her where she is.\u201d\n\nIt seemed like a big deal to him, so I dropped it. But it wasn\u2019t easy. Sometimes I woke up in the middle of the night with the horrible feeling that I was being watched. Then I\u2019d look up and see her haunting gray eyes staring down at me.\n\nI didn\u2019t get much sleep after that.\n\nAnd there was the one time I swear she moved. \u201cWas her hand always like that?\u201d I asked Eric, after getting into bed one night.\n\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer left hand. The fingers are kind of open, reaching out behind her. Like she\u2019s waiting for someone to grab her hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, she was always like that.\u201d\n\nI could\u2019ve sworn she *wasn\u2019t* always like that. Then again, I generally avoided looking at the painting. It was so uncomfortably realistic. When I stared into those gray eyes, I almost felt like I was making eye contact with a person.\n\nI lasted two weeks. Then I begged Eric to move it.\n\n\u201cCan we *please* move the painting somewhere else? I really hate looking at it when I\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the nicest piece of art we have. It belongs above the bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about the sunflower one?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just a print,\u201d he complained. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so basic.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on. I\u2019ll move my Funko Pops out if you move the painting out.\u201d\n\nHe heaved a long sigh. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll move her.\u201d\n\nThat was another thing. He often referred to the painting as \u201cher.\u201d It was weird.\n\nSo he moved it to the stairs. But honestly, that was worse. Every time I went downstairs, there she was. Staring at me from above the landing with those piercing gray eyes. At least when the painting was in the bedroom, I was usually asleep or facing the opposite direction.\n\nI hit my breaking point a few days after that.\n\nFor some reason I couldn\u2019t sleep. After tossing and turning for an hour, I decided to grab a snack downstairs. I got to the top of the stairs\u2026 and there she was.\n\nI hadn\u2019t turned on the main lights\u2014only the nightlight in the hall bathroom was on. With everything so dark, the background of the painting melted into the shadows. But the woman still stood out, with her pale face and white dress.\n\nAnd my stupid, sleepy brain interpreted it as an actual person standing there.\n\nI jumped about a foot in the air. And I would\u2019ve fallen all the way down the stairs, had I not caught the banister at the last second.\n\n\u201cCan we pleeeease get rid of that painting?\u201d I asked the next morning.\n\nEric turned away from the stove, set the spatula down. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cLast night, it scared the frick out of me. I nearly fell down the stairs.\u201d\n\nHe stared at me, as if unable to understand. \u201cShe\u2026 scared you?\u201d he asked slowly.\n\n\u201cWell, more like startled me. I thought it was actually a person standing there.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me.\n\nThen he broke into laughter. And, after a few seconds, I started laughing too. It *was* pretty stupid, now that I thought about it. I know I was sleepy, but still\u2014I thought the painting was a *person?!* What, did I think we were being burglarized by a young, beautiful, blonde woman in a nightdress?\n\n\u201cFor now, I\u2019ll move her into my office. Then you don\u2019t have to look at her at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds good.\u201d\n\nAnd for a while after that, things were okay. I sort of noticed Eric spending more time in his office than usual, but he also had a big deadline for a brief coming up. And what, how would that be related to the painting, anyway? It\u2019s not like he was staring at her for hours on end.\n\nExcept that\u2019s exactly what I caught him doing.\n\nOne night he didn\u2019t come downstairs to eat dinner with me. I called up to him a few times. No reply. So I went upstairs and walked into his office\u2014to find him staring at her.\n\nHe was just sitting there. With his computer closed. No papers on the desk. Swivel chair turned towards the woman in the painting.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said suddenly, when I walked in. Then he quickly stood up. \u201cI was just about to come down. Just sent in the brief a few minutes ago. They\u2019re really happy with it.\u201d\n\nHe smiled broadly at me, as if nothing were wrong, and then slipped past me. I listened to his footsteps thump down the stairs.\n\n*Had he actually just finished working?*\n\n*Or was he just sitting in here\u2026 staring at her?*\n\nI ultimately decided not to bring it up. The painting was out of my sight and that was great. Besides, I had bigger fish to fry, like my own deadline coming up for an article I hadn\u2019t even started.\n\nBut then, on Friday afternoon, I accidentally overheard him on the phone. His voice was muffled through the thick wooden door, but it wasn\u2019t hard to hear him. He was shouting, almost.\n\n*\u201cI\u2019ll have it in by tonight\u2014\u201d*\n\n*\u201cNo, I knew it was due on Wednesday\u2014\u201d*\n\n*\u201cWell, my wife fell down the stairs. I had to take her to the hospital.\u201d*\n\nThose words sent a chill through me. I barged in.\n\n\u201cWhy are you lying about me falling down the stairs?\u201d\n\nHis face paled. He ended the call and turned towards me. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Tara. But I needed an excuse. I missed the deadline on that brief, and it\u2019s my job on the line\u2014\"\n\n\u201cThe brief you told me you finished two days ago?\u201d\n\nHe nodded, silently.\n\nI crossed my arms. \u201cLook, Eric, your work is your business. But we\u2019ve spent, like, all of one hour together all week. Because you\u2019ve been locked in here all day, every day. I mean, are you even working? Or are you just sitting in here, staring at *her?*\u201d\n\nHis dark eyes locked on mine. And then his voice grew soft. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re jealous of her.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 *What?!\u201d*\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be, Tara,\u201d he said, stepping towards me. \u201cThe painting makes her prettier than she was.\u201d\n\nI froze. Stared at him.\n\nThen I finally found the words. \u201cAre you saying\u2026 this is a painting of someone you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cSorry, I misspoke. I meant, whoever this is a portrait of, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a flattering likeness. All portraits are flattering like that.\u201d\n\nI stared at him, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\n\u201cWho is this a painting of, Eric?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you, it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEric.\u201d I stepped towards him. My legs felt weak, wobbling underneath me. \u201c*Who is this a painting of?!\u201d*\n\nHe only shook his head.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI couldn\u2019t sleep that night.\n\nI know, it sounds silly, being so worked up over a painting. But you have to admit it was weird. He was obsessed with this thing, for whatever reason. *Why didn\u2019t I see the painting when we were dating? Did he hide it away in the basement?* That was the one place I\u2019d never been. Had he built a little shrine down there, painting, candles, the whole nine yards?\n\nThe thought of it made me sick.\n\n*Is it an ex-girlfriend? An ex-wife, even, that he never told me about?* Getting a painting commissioned must have cost a fortune. Especially a huge, detailed one like this. I mean, as much as I hated that thing, it was clearly done by someone incredibly gifted. The glint in those piercing gray eyes, the small dimple on her right cheek\u2026\n\nBut clearly he wasn\u2019t keeping it to appreciate the artistry.\n\n*He knew her.*\n\n*And whoever she is, he\u2019s obsessed with her.*\n\nAnd then I got the craziest idea.\n\nI sat up in bed. Slowly, quietly. Turned to Eric. He was fast asleep. Then I slipped out from underneath the covers, grabbed my phone from the nightstand\u2014and tiptoed out of the room.\n\nMy bare feet padded softly across the hallway as I made my way towards his office. Then I pushed the heavy wooden door open and stepped inside.\n\nThe office was cold\u2014much colder than our bedroom. Goosebumps pricked up my bare arms. But I didn\u2019t waste any time. I reached over, fumbling across the wall, and hit the switch.\n\nThe light flicked on.\n\nThe blonde woman stared down at me from the wall. Her eyes seemed to follow me as I took Eric\u2019s leather chair and dragged it across the hardwood. Once against the wall, I stepped up onto it.\n\nWe were staring at each other, face to face.\n\nI\u2019d never been this close to the painting before. My face inches from hers. This close, I could truly appreciate the detail. Each individual eyelash painstakingly drawn, curving up from its follicle. Threadlike striations of light and dark gray filling her irises. Her skin, so pale and creamy, dotted with the tiniest of pores.\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t here to appreciate the artwork.\n\nI lifted my phone\u2014and took a photo.\n\nThen I brought up a reverse image search.\n\nIt took a few minutes for me to find the right website and upload the photo. But when the results loaded\u2026 I gasped.\n\nI expected maybe one result, if I were lucky. Some sort of facial recognition that would match the painted face to a photo. Or, maybe the artist\u2019s website would come up, and mention who the subject was. But instead\u2014*dozens* of thumbnails filled the page. Of the exact same painting I\u2019d been staring at for weeks.\n\nFingers trembling, I clicked on the first one. It led to a news article.\n\n**Search Continues for Missing Franklin Art Student**\n\nMy heart dropped. Little black dots danced in my vision. I collapsed into the chair behind me, trembling, and began to read.\n\n*Anya Kelsing, 23, went missing after a hike with her boyfriend\u2026*\n\n*The two became separated when they came upon a bear\u2026*\n\n*Her backpack was found roughly a mile from where the sighting occurred, but no trace of Anya was found\u2026*\n\nAnd the caption under the painting.\n\n*Kelsing is a third-year student at Franklin College, majoring in Fine Arts. She recently completed a self-portrait that was exhibited at Le Coeur (above)*\n\nI clicked on the next article, and the next\u2014but they all said the same thing. Hike, bear, disappearance. All of them showed a photo along with her self-portrait; she looked strikingly identical to her painted likeness. None of them mentioned the boyfriend\u2019s name, but it had to be Eric. The most recent article, from five years ago, was a video clip of her parents begging for her search to continue. Sadly, judging by the news articles, it never did.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long I sat there. All I know is that I was suddenly jolted from my thoughts by a loud *thump* in the hallway.\n\nFootsteps. Coming towards the office.\n\nI shot up. *He can\u2019t find me here.* I glanced around the room, looking for someplace\u2014any place\u2014that I could hide. But it was probably too late. Surely he\u2019d seen the light on, from under the door\u2026\n\nI ducked under the desk just as he stepped into the room.\n\n\u201cTara?\u201d\n\nI clapped my hand over my mouth, trying to silence my ragged breathing. *He\u2019s going to see the chair out of place. He knows I\u2019m here. He knows\u2026*\n\n\u201cTara, you in here?\u201d\n\n*Why did I hide? I could\u2019ve just said I came in here because I heard a noise. Needed a pen. Couldn\u2019t sleep. Why the fuck did I hide? Now he\u2019s going to know that I know\u2026*\n\n\u201cTara?\u201d\n\n*But maybe it\u2019s fine. Maybe the bear got Anya, maybe Eric had nothing to do with it. Isn\u2019t that more likely than Eric being a murderer?*\n\n\u201cThere you are.\u201d\n\nI looked up\u2014and screamed.\n\nEric was crouched there, in front of the desk, staring at me.\n\n\u201cI\u2014I was looking for a pen,\u201d I stuttered, lamely. \u201cI wanted to write down\u2014I remembered I have to pick up groceries tomorrow and I needed to add something\u2026\u201d\n\nHe tilted his head, a small smile on his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the truth, Tara.\u201d\n\n*Make a break for it.*\n\nI started to lunge out from under the desk. His hand quickly shot out and grabbed my wrist. *Hard.* \u201cYou figured out who she is, didn\u2019t you? That\u2019s the only reason you\u2019d be hiding from me.\u201d\n\nI trembled in his grasp. \u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d I whispered.\n\nHe let out a dry laugh. \u201cSo you think I\u2019m a murderer. How nice, that\u2019s the first conclusion you jump to.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014no, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a murderer.\u201d I swallowed. *Stupid, stupid, stupid. If he killed her, and he knows you know\u2026 then you\u2019re dead too.* \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that. Just\u2026 what happened? They didn\u2019t find a body. Did the bear get her?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t reply. Just stared at me, silently, with those cold dark eyes.\n\n\u201cI was jealous,\u201d I continued, desperately, \u201cbut now I understand. I wish you\u2019d just told me. To lose someone like that\u2026 of course you\u2019d want to keep the painting. It\u2019s all you have left of her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should have just left it alone,\u201d he said, his tone oddly emotionless. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to find out this way.\u201d\n\nI screamed as he lunged for me.\n\n*It\u2019s over.* His hands were clenched tight on my wrists as he dragged me out from under the desk. I pulled back, trying to wrench myself free, but it was no use\u2014\n\n*Thump!*\n\nA loud crash sounded behind us. Eric whipped around, and for a split second\u2014his grip released.\n\nI acted instantly. Pulled free from him and ran, pivoting around the desk and racing towards the door. As I glanced back, I saw Eric, starting after me.\n\nBut I also saw what had made the noise.\n\nThe painting of Anya had fallen from the wall. It lay askew on the floor, her gray eyes staring emptily upwards.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI was always a fast runner.\n\nEric was only halfway down the stairs by the time I was at the bottom. Bursting out into the cold air, I began to scream. He grabbed me from behind and tried to pull me back inside, but it was too late. Lights were flicking on. Our neighbor rushed out of his house, dialing 911.\n\nIt was over.\n\nThe police arrested Eric for assault. And once I told them my story, of his obsession with Anya\u2019s painting, they were able to search our house. And hidden in his office drawer, in a small box, was a pair of gold earrings.\n\nThe same earrings Anya wore on the hike that day.\n\nThe case is slowly mounting against him. I\u2019m hoping, praying Anya gets justice and that a jury convicts him of her horrible murder.\n\nAnd would he have done the same to me, if I hadn\u2019t escaped? If Anya\u2019s painting hadn\u2019t fallen off the wall?\n\nThere was an explanation, of course. When Eric had moved the painting to his office, he\u2019d mistakenly installed one of the hangers into pure drywall. The weight of the painting had caused it to rip out, and the painting fell.\n\nBut sometimes, I think Anya was watching over me. That her self-portrait carried a piece of her. And that night, she\u2019d protected me from falling victim to the monster who ended her life.\n\nThe painting now hangs up in my foyer. Every day I walk by it, and new details pop out at me: the deep, shadowy green of the room behind her. A perfectly-painted strand of blonde hair. The glint in her piercing gray eyes.\n\nAnd sometimes, I think she\u2019s smiling back at me.",

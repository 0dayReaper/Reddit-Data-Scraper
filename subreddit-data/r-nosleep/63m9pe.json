    "postText": "My wife and I are beside ourselves right now. This is the type of thing you see in the movies, but now it\u2019s happening to us.\n\nYesterday evening, a little after six, my wife and I were in the kitchen cooking dinner when my six-year-old (almost 7) son Kyle walked in from the back patio. He was holding a folded piece of paper in his hand and had a strange look on his face. My son is constantly drawing (and loves to read and write) so this usually wouldn\u2019t have stood out to me at all, but he\u2019d just come in from hitting the baseball off the tee and really had no reason to be holding a piece of paper. \n\nMy son is the type of kid who wears his emotions on his sleeve. When I asked to see the piece of paper, I could tell he didn\u2019t really want to give it to me because he flashed his typical *I\u2019m gonna be in trouble if I do* face. I insisted, and he finally handed it over. Here\u2019s what it said:\n\n&gt;Dear Kyle,\n\n&gt;I know this note may sound scary,\n\n&gt;(your daddy will think it is),\n\n&gt;but grownups don\u2019t know \n\n&gt;how friendships can grow\n\n&gt;when kids are just left to be kids.\n\n&gt;And what a kid you\u2019ve become, Kyle!\n\n&gt;You\u2019re growing as fast as a weed.\n\n&gt;Last night off the tee\n\n&gt;you stroked it for three\n\n&gt;and your team took a two-run lead!\n\n&gt;Yes, I\u2019ve been watching (a while now, its true).\n\n&gt;I think we would make perfect friends.\n\n&gt;You\u2019re a kid through and through,\n\n&gt;And I am one too,\n\n&gt;even if just for pretends.\n\n&gt;The problem, I fear, is your parents.\n\n&gt;(I doubt they would let us hang out).\n\n&gt;One is just rude,\n\n&gt;the other a prude,\n\n&gt;church-going, pure, holy, devout.\n\n&gt;I\u2019ve got an idea\n\n&gt;(can you tell my hand\u2019s shaking?)\n\n&gt;for me and you getting together!\n\n&gt;Tomorrow at three,\n\n&gt;you can come and see me\n\n&gt;at the address attached to this letter.\n\n&gt;But please (pretty please!)\n\n&gt;don\u2019t tell your dad!\n\n&gt;Your mom and he won\u2019t understand.\n\n&gt;Just come by yourself,\n\n&gt;I\u2019ll be dressed as an elf!\n\n&gt;And we can even hold hands!\n\n&gt;Would you like that?\n\n&gt;(You will! You really will Kyle!)\n\n&gt;We will have (my oh my) so much fun!\n\n&gt;So I\u2019ll see you at three,\n\n&gt;by the sycamore tree,\n\n&gt;where our two kindred souls become one!\n\nThere was an address scribbled at the bottom of the page.\n\n&gt;3 Orange Circle.\n\nI knew immediately it wasn\u2019t a prank. \n\nCarrie, my wife, is the youth group leader at our church. And Kyle did just have a tee ball game last night. Orange Circle is only one street over from our street, and I'm pretty sure lot 3 is the corner lot on the culdesac, which has an empty house with a large sycamore tree in the backyard. \n\nWas this sicko really watching Kyle\u2019s game? What would have happened I hadn\u2019t seen him with the letter?\n\nI shouted for my wife to come read it. When she did, she flipped out, and ran for the phone to call the police. \n\nI flipped the note over, and on the back was some more text. I couldn\u2019t read it at first, but quickly realized it was written backwards, I\u2019m guessing so Kyle couldn\u2019t have read it. To read it, I had to hold it up in front of a mirror:\n\n&gt;And now (just in case)\n\n&gt;if your Dad\u2019s reading this,\n\n&gt;it\u2019s time to tell him a story.\n\n&gt;If your mom flaps her hole\n\n&gt;Or your dad tells a soul,\n\n&gt;I\u2019m afraid things might get rather gory. \n\n&gt;On the 10th of July, \n\n&gt;1995,\n\n&gt;A woman named Susie went missing,\n\n&gt;Susie, you see,\n\n&gt;(unlike you and me)\n\n&gt;wasn\u2019t careful about who she\u2019d been kissing.\n\n&gt;I kept her a while (but old things get so boring!)\n\n&gt;and in time I had gotten my fill.\n\n&gt;I threw her away\n\n&gt;and to my great dismay\n\n&gt;the hunger I felt plagued me still.\n\n&gt;I tried to bury it deep down inside\n\n&gt;(where nothing down there can escape).\n\n&gt;But lately it seems\n\n&gt;I see Kyle in my dreams\n\n&gt;And that hunger can no longer hide.\n\n&gt;Now that you know what I\u2019m capable of\n\n&gt;(more than both of you can comprehend),\n\n&gt; if one word is spoken,\n\n&gt;then children get broken,\n\n&gt;and Susie will have a new friend.\n\nThe police arrived in a half hour and we showed them the note. They told us to stay inside and lock the doors for the remainder of the night. The man had obviously been in our (fenced-in) back yard, which made me sick to my stomach and had me cursing myself for not installing the security camera I\u2019d gotten for Christmas. \n\nNothing happened last night, thank God.\n\nThis morning, I got a call from the detective assigned to our case. He\u2019d reviewed the list of missing persons cases from 1995 and something had turned up. \n\nSuzanne Kerrington went missing July 10th, 1995, just as the note said. The last person to see her alive was a friend who saw her at the 24-hour gym they attended together. Susie had said she\u2019d met someone new and wanted to get a quick workout in before getting ready for their second date. Susie was never seen again and the man was never identified. \n\nAnd, maybe the worst part, was Suzanne's address. \n\n3 Orange Circle. \n\nI'm supposed to meet with the detective later this evening. \n\nWhat should we do?\n\nUPDATE: The detective just called back. They're sending an unmarked patrol car with two plainclothes officers to 3 Orange Circle at 3 p.m. today. Kyle's teachers have been notified and he's safe at school and won't be going to recess today. I'll update tomorrow with any news.\n\n[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/63uu1m/the_terrifying_note_addressed_to_my_sixyearold/)\n\n***\n\n[Download the FREE audiobook!](https://gumroad.com/l/RRPSp)\n",

Then you can assume he was probably close in age with the victim if she was interested in dating him. Which means this suspect is most likely between the ages of 50 and 60 years old now. I would look more towards  a grandpa rather than a dad. \nYou said even grandparents go to these baseball games I am telling you it is probably one of them. Any males who would be close to that age range are suspects.",

A tennis buddy was running for a ball hit out wide and ran into the chain link fence ear-first. His ear got caught in it just right to be ripped almost completely off. It was hanging by a little piece of skin at the lobe. Well, he said it didn't hurt at all and he didn't even realize his ear had ripped off until his partner told him. He just held a towel on it to soak up the blood and got driven to the hospital to have it sewn back on. \n\nSo that tells me it might not be a reliable way to neutralize an attacker. ",

So, if I have to guess, he wrote it with the primary intention for you to read it. What are his real intentions? I am not sure but he sure as hell couldn't be hoping that a 6yo would understand the letter and show up at the appointment all while hiding everything from his parents. Please for your family's sake  try to figure out the real meaning of this letter. Hopefully the police will wise up to this little point too.  Be safe. \n",

Some kids can read at 6 - I could - but it's a bit of a long poem to expect a 6 year old to read, digest, and follow all the instructions in there.\n\nIt's also very, very odd that a child predator would write a note and specifically add something for you to read on it. Normally, they wouldn't want to leave any sort of paper trail at all, right? So that suggests either that they entirely expected you to read it, or that they're someone who doesn't have faith in their ability to befriend a child in person. It might be worth the police taking a good look at people who are socially isolated or have issues with speech or making themselves understood.\n\nThe whole \"Oooh no, don't warn the police!\" thing seems especially interesting to me. I don't think anyone could seriously expect you to do anything other than warning the police in this situation, warning or no warning. It is possible that this person wants to be caught somehow; maybe guilt about what happened years ago with the previous victim has caught up with them. Or it could be that they consider themselves untouchable somehow and relish the thought of outwitting the police.\n\nOr... or they want to give themselves the excuse to do whatever they want regardless of what you do. If you hadn't called the police, then in their head they could take that as assent to whatever they plan to do. Since you have called the police, they'll probably tell themselves \"Well, I warned Creeping_dread about what happened, guess I can go ahead and punish them now\". Either way, they'd felt justified in their own mind about what they were going to do, which - let's face it - was probably the same damn thing whichever decision you made, so getting the police involved was the right call.\n\nLast thing. There is a 19th Century French prose-poem called The Song of Maldoror. The title character is a fiendish figure who, in the last section, writes a letter to a youth to lure him to a place of Maldoror's choosing with murderous intent. If our elf cosplayer has an interest in poetry, they might be using that for inspiration.",

            "comment": "I've said it here before and I'll say it again: firearms friend. If you're lacking in training, not to fear, I can help!\n\nIF you're in close quarters, \"go big or go home\" is not as applicable, necessary, or advised. The light and sound from the discharge can be disorienting to both the target AND YOU. Additionally, it sounds like you live in a rather developed area. Larger calibers are capable of carrying large amounts of kinetic energy over vast distances and often materials such as wood, sheetrock, plumbing, siding will NOT slow those rounds much. Basically, you can and will shoot through your house and into the neighbors.\n\nMy recommendation? Depends on the size of your lot but if it's as I imagine....a 9mm handgun will suit your needs. If you feel you need more stopping power than that or that your aim is poor, I'd lean towards a 12ga shotgun. Go pump action as they can hold more rounds. Remove the wood block from the magazine to hold about...3 extra shells. *NOTE:* in the United States, that wood block is in there to prevent you from having \"too many\" rounds for hunting purposes. In my particular jurisdiction, removing it for home defense is a non-issue so long as the firearm is never used for hunting. Check local laws first. Most reputable dealers can tell you all pertinent laws.\n\nIf you choose a 9mm, pick one that is comfortable, fits your hand well, is easy *for you* to use, and reliable. I recommend hollow points to drop bodies, jacketed rounds for plinking and practice.\n\nIf you go shotgun, DO NOT use slugs, the issue of accidentally shooting into your neighbors foyer is present. Bird or buck shot would be better, a winchester PDX-1 is the BEST for home defense. Trust me, someone on the receiving end of that round is not having a good day.\n\nIf you really, really, really wanna mess someone up and have no issue when the cops show up, study up on your states castle law and know what you can and can't do but I'll use my state as an example: where I live, if you are in my house without my express permission and you are threatening my own life or the lives of my loved ones, I will not bat an eye as I pump round after round into your sorry ass and neither will the police. My firearm of choice for said adventure? The Taurus Judge: a 5 round revolver, chambered in .45 long colt or .410 shotgun. Remember that nifty PDX-1 round I mentioned above? It's offered in .410. Five rounds of \"fuck you\" in a convenient night stand sized package. I'd recommend designating a room in your house as a \"stronghold\" - it is the most defensible room in the house, ideally with only one point of ingress/egress, no windows, and access to a landline/cell/some form of communication. You and your family can come up with a predesignated signal to retreat to said room.\n\nThe advantages of a room like this are many. If you have communication/multiple forms of communication present, you can call out for help. No windows means no surprises. One entryway creates what we in the business liked to call a \"fatal funnel\". Basically, it can even out overwhelming odds by forcing attackers to come at you one at a time and forcing them into a kill zone.\n\nAs for safety: you have a kiddo, so change this as you see fit. Kiddo in my house isn't much older than yours but has been taught firearms safety and uses them on a regular basis. I have no issue leaving loaded firearms in my nightstand but ONLY BECAUSE HE'S AWARE OF THE DANGER. Were I in your position? I'd keep a loaded sidearm in the nightstand with the safety on. I'd keep my \"big bad\" secured in a case in my stronghold. If a case isn't an option, I'd invest in a trigger lock and keep the key on my person. If it's a magazine fed weapon, the mags would be loaded and with the weapon, but not in the weapon itself. If it's, say, a shotgun, I'd have rounds in the tube, safety on, and a trigger lock. Basically, be as safe as you have to WITH MINIMAL EFFORT TO BRING THE WEAPON TO \"RED DIRECT\" STATUS - basically locked, cocked, and ready to rock.\n\nA few other pointers -\nALWAYS treat a weapon like it's loaded even when you know it isn't.\n\nALWAYS be aware of the direction and orientation of the muzzle of a weapon.\n\nNEVER aim a weapon at something you have no intent to put down. If I've drawn a firearm, I FULLY plan on using it and have accepted whatever repercussions may come of it.\n\nNEVER place your finger in, on, around, or near the trigger unless you are 110% GOING TO PULL THE TRIGGER.\n\nYou remember those few tips and spend an afternoon at a range and you'll be fine. Good luck OP.",

I contacted police they basically told me it's a neighbor screwing with me. Be careful out there. Always pay attention to everyone. You cannot become compliant ever. Even after this situation is settled. At first I acted funny like I was up to something in public. Now I adjusted to be able to visualize everyone in my area, have an escape plan, as well as an alternative weapon. I promise you, the best defense is yourself and what you're capable of. If I were you I'd have your son in your room, and maintain the windows with nails or trip alarms until it's settled. Also invest in firearms, dogs, alternative weapons. I don't care if it's hairspray and a lighter. Anythings a weapon used in the right way. ",

And remember, we don't know if this is one person. Anyone could be an accomplice, or they may ask children to talk your son and lure him somewhere. You really can't trust anybody. No babysitters, trust only the people closest to you and make sure multiple eyes are always on your son. Install those cameras immediately.\n\nYou may want to request some officers keep an eye on him for awhile. If this person has an itch to scratch, they'll likely try to get close to your family or commit murder somewhere else.\n\nI really hope they catch the person OP. For Kyle's sake.

    "postText": "Cayden was my best friend, but there were a few things about him that drove me nuts: starting with the way he always kept a screen between himself and everything else.\r  \nIf something happened around Cayden, you could bet your ass it was getting recorded and uploaded to social media. \r  \nThat's why, when he couldn't show us a photo of his new girlfriend, we had serious doubts about whether or not she actually existed. \r  \n'Emma doesn't like cameras' was the only explanation we got\u2013and considering Cayden's last two girlfriends, it wasn't really all that strange. Fresh in our minds were Taliah, Cayden's ex who wound up hospitalized because she consumed nothing but cranberry juice for over a month, and Kim, his ex before that, who once spent a three-hour road-trip trying to convince us that aliens built the pyramids. \r  \nGiven what we'd experienced of Cayden's dates so far, something as simple as an aversion to photos didn't seem quite so extreme\u2013\r  \nNot then, anyway.\r  \nWhen Cayden introduced us to Emma, it was at an old family restaurant on the far edge of town. Apparently, she wouldn't go anywhere that might have cameras recording her, and Cayden called a sort of emergency meeting to remind us just how seriously she took the whole thing. \r  \n\"Do you think she's like, a spy or something?\" Our pal Carlos teased.\r  \n\"Probably more like a serial killer\u2026\" Leah added. \r  \n\"You guys,\" Cayden rolled his eyes. \"Please! Emma is a perfectly normal girl!\" The looks on our faces said that we'd believe it when we saw it, but to our surprise, Emma was\u2026wonderful. In fact, the only real mystery seemed to be what the hell such a thoughtful, clever, beautiful person was doing with a deadbeat like Cayden.\r  \n\"It was a pleasure to meet you all,\" Emma said at the end of the evening, with a level of grace and good manners that was typically unheard-of among Cayden's dates. I was so taken by her that I barely even noticed how she just\u2026walked away\u2026down the road after she said her goodbyes. There was nowhere she could have parked down there, no visible way back into town\u2026\r  \nI might not ever have thought anything more of it, if I hadn't spotted Emma while out for an evening walk a few days later. Cayden\u2019s girlfriend was crossing the bridge by the skate park, walking fast with her head down. Across the street, a skater had gotten down into a dad squat to record his friend's amateur trick. \r  \nEmma had noticed him, too.Her neck snapped in the skaters' direction. \r  \nAll of the grace and gentleness that Cayden\u2019s girlfriend had displayed for us disappeared. She sprinted across traffic with a murderous glint in her eyes, smashing the kid\u2019s phone to the ground, stomping on its screen again and again with a heavy boot.\r  \nOf course, the teenagers shouted and protested\u2013but only for a second. From where I was standing, I couldn\u2019t see what Emma did\u2013I only saw the skaters\u2019 reaction. A look of pure terror flickered across their faces. They backed away from the tiny, non-threatening girl in front of them and ran, even leaving behind their boards in their hurry to escape. \r  \nEmma finished stomping on the phone and began looking around for witnesses. I ducked behind a concrete column, unable to shake the feeling that I'd seen something I shouldn't have. The only thing I knew for sure after what I'd witnessed was that Cayden was right: Emma really, really didn't like having her picture taken. \r  \nThere was an uneasy feeling in my gut as I walked home that night. I hoped that Cayden\u2019s odd new girlfriend was just an anti-technology conspiracy theorist\u2026or something. But it was hard to put such an innocent explanation on what I\u2019d seen\u2013and the dream I had that night made it even harder.\r  \nIn my nightmare, a woman made of pure shadow chased me through a barren forest while I took a video of every step, found-footage style. I told myself to stop trying to record her, to just RUN, but in that sick sort of logic particular to dreams, my body refused to listen to me. \r  \nMy legs moved slower and slower\u2026\r  \nLike I\u2019d been drugged, like I was running through thick mud\u2026\r  \nThen the shadows icy-cold, inhuman fingers closed around my neck from behind.\r  \nI woke up coughing, sputtering\u2013and choking.\r  \nMaybe that nightmare was what made me less than enthusiastic when Cayden suggested that we go for a hike with Emma and her friends\u2013it was one of the few activities that we could all do together where Emma wouldn't have to worry about being recorded, and according to Cayden, her friends were just as camera-shy as she was. \r  \nFilled with foreboding, I grilled Cayden for more information before the day of the big hike: just what was it that bothered Emma so much about being recorded?\r  \nEvasive at first, he eventually came around to admitting it was probably some sort of political thing: Emma and her friends mentioned their 'sacred rights,' any time the topic came up\u2013the right to privacy, Cayden supposed. The truth, I realized, was that he had no idea.\r  \nWhen I pulled into the gravel lot off of the forest road where our hike would begin, a small circle of people were waiting for me. Maybe it was just paranoia, but the way they all looked toward my car at once made me feel like they were plotting something. \r  \nI only recognized one of the faces in the circle\u2013Emma\u2019s. She smiled and waved me over to meet her equally photogenic (and photophobic) friends: Tucker, Hugh, and Caroline. Everyone was welcoming, everyone was cheerful, everyone was perfect\u2013to the point that it seemed uncanny. In fact, when I wasn\u2019t looking at them, their faces all seemed to blend together in my mind, coalescing into one generically-attractive mask\u2026with only darkness underneath.\r  \nI shuddered and searched for Cayden, wondering if he had noticed the same thing I had\u2013\r  \nBut my friend had already started down the trail, rambling to Emma about how many views his latest Instagram post had gotten. I hurried after them; for some reason, the thought of being left alone with Emma\u2019s eerily-perfect friends filled me with dread. \r  \nIt was spring, but nothing was blooming; carrion birds circled ominously in the cloudy sky overhead. Last year\u2019s leaves crunched beneath my feet with every step. I picked up my pace, and Emma\u2019s friends filled in behind me like a creepy honor guard. They made a point to include me in their conversation, but their talk was all surface chatter: after two hours of walking, I realized that I still didn\u2019t know anything real about any of them: not where they lived, what they did for a living, or even how they knew Emma.\r  \nUp ahead, the bare brown branches opened out into a magnificent clifftop, but I didn\u2019t want to get too close to the edge\u2013\r  \nNot with Emma\u2019s friends so close behind me. \r  \nAlthough Cayden was constantly reminding us not to record anything, the view must\u2019ve triggered some primal Influencer instinct: he took his phone from his pocket without even thinking. Emma and her friends tensed up like he\u2019d just pulled a gun on them.\r  \nHe squatted in front of the view, started to raise the camera in selfie mode\u2013\r  \n\u201cCayden!\u201d Emma scolded, angrier than I\u2019d ever seen her. My friend had stopped lifting his phone seconds before all of them would have appeared on screen. Cayden returned the device to his pocket, mumbling apologies\u2026but there was a troubled look in his eyes that hadn\u2019t been there before. \r  \nWe carried on with our walk as though nothing had happened, but I sensed that Cayden was dying to tell me something\u2013if only we could get some privacy. Unfortunately, Emma and her friends didn\u2019t leave us alone for a second\u2026in fact, it almost felt like they were sticking close to us on purpose. The forest began to feel very big, very lonesome\u2026and very far from help. As the trail wound down into a shadowy gorge,Cayden picked up his pace; he walked far ahead with Emma, hands stuffed into his pockets. At first I thought he was just cold\u2026then I felt my phone buzz. \r  \n\u201cUh, guys?\u201d I muttered to Tucker, Hugh, and Caroline, \u201cdo you mind? I gotta go take care of some business behind a tree.\u201d The three of them exchanged a dark glance, but backed off far enough for me to crouch in the bushes and read Cayden\u2019s message:\r  \n\u201cUSE YOUR CAMERA\u201d it read. The guy was on his phone so much he\u2019d been able to type it out in his pocket without even looking.\r  \nI frowned and peered out from where I squatted. Emma\u2019s friends still waited for me up ahead. Holding my phone just above the carpet of leaves, I looked at the screen out of the corner of my eye\u2026but where Tucker, Hugh, and Caroline stood, I only saw shadows. \r  \nMy blood turned to ice. I lowered the phone, raised it\u2013\r  \nand lowered it again when Emma\u2019s friends looked suspiciously my way.\r  \nNo doubt about it. \r  \nThe leafless trees and gray sky showed up fine\u2013\r  \nBut according to the camera, Emma\u2019s friends were figures of pure darkness.\r  \nMy throat was dry as I fixed myself and strolled leisurely back to the group.\r  \n\u201cSorry,\u201d I tried to laugh. \u201cI think I ate some bad tacos last night.\u201d My comment was met with smiles, sympathy, and even an offer of stomach medicine\u2026but I had no intention of drinking anything that those four gave me. A horrible thought ran through my mind: Cayden and Emma had split a bottle of water for the hike, but I hadn\u2019t seen her take a single sip all day\u2026 \r  \n\u201cWe\u2019d, uh, better catch up with the others, don\u2019t you think?\u201d I stammered.\r  \nMore smiles. \r  \nI practically jogged down the empty trail, that feeling of foreboding growing stronger and stronger. I longed to see a park ranger, a couple walking their dog, anyone\u2013\r  \nBut between the grim weather and the remoteness of the spot, there wasn\u2019t a soul to be found. I suddenly wondered if that was intentional. I finally spotted Cayden up ahead. He was leaning on a tree beside an overgrown path, a dazed expression on his pale face. \r  \n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I panted. Cayden lurched forward like he was about to puke on his shoes.\r  \n\u201cCayden isn\u2019t feeling well,\u201d Emma spoke for him. \u201cThere\u2019s a shortcut here that leads back to the cars\u2026I was thinking we ought to take it, don\u2019t you? Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve been down it before, so we know where it goes.\u201d \r  \nThe narrow dirt track wove down among murky cliffs. \r  \nWe\u2019ve been down it before. \r  \nWe know where it goes.\r  \nI didn\u2019t doubt any of that; I just doubted that the sketchy path would ever lead back to the parking lot.I just doubted that we\u2019d ever come back alive if we went down it\u2026 \r  \n\u201cI\u2019d hate to ruin your hike,\u201d I replied finally. \u201cI\u2019ll just help him back to the car myself.\u201d \r  \n\u201cWe\u2019ll all go.\u201d Emma\u2019s friend Hugh cut in. \r  \n\u201cWe\u2019d hate for anything to happen to you.\u201d Caroline added. \r  \n\u201cNo! I\u2019M his friend, and I said I\u2019m taking him back MYSELF!\u201d \r  \nNerves made my voice crack; it echoed back mockingly from the desolate rock walls of the gorge. I looked from one cheerful face to another; no one spoke. Was it just me, or were they inching closer? A stick cracked beneath my heel as I stepped backwards, then everything happened at once. \r  \nA few crows took off squawking from the bushes nearby.\r  \nCayden slumped over into the dead leaves.\r  \nEmma and her friends sprung toward me, their smiles fixed as their hands grabbed my arms, pinning me\u2013\r  \nAnd while their hands looked normal, the shape of their fingers felt many-jointed and wrong\u2026and their grasp was icy cold. \r  \n\u201cCAYDEN!\u201d I screamed my friend\u2019s name seconds before Emma pinched my nose shut and poured what was left of the \u201cwater bottle\u201d she\u2019d poisoned down my sputtering throat.\r  \nThings get blurry after that. \r  \nI remember a hazy image of Hugh and Carolie grabbing Cayden beneath his armpits and dragging him down the trail; moments later, my own legs gave out. \r  \nWhen my eyes snapped open again, the sky had darkened. Cayden dangled upside-down by a rope from a wizened, ancient tree in front of me, a bonfire beneath him. He was still unconscious. Emma, Hugh, Tucker, and Caroline stood in a circle around where he hung. \r  \nA damp, musty smell filled the air, and a cool breeze blew across my face. There must be a cave nearby, I thought. I was just about to turn my head to look when the faces of Emma and her monstrous friends snapped toward me. I shut my eyes tight, pretending to still be unconscious, but they weren\u2019t looking at me. Footsteps were approaching from the subterranean fissure behind me. I lay perfectly still as whatever was making them strode over me and toward the bonfire. When I finally dared to peek again, I saw that the group around my unconscious friend had opened a space in their circle; I couldn\u2019t see the thing that occupied it, but I could see the twisted, semi-human shadow that it cast in the fire\u2019s light. \r  \nThe group began to sway and chant. As they did, Cayden seemed to fade\u2026\r  \nAnd the thing in the circle began to take on his appearance, clothes and all. \r  \nWith an immense effort, I wiggled my toe. Then my whole foot. Whatever drug they\u2019d fed me was beginning to wear off\u2013probably because Cayden had already drunk most of it, and I\u2019d drunk less in a shorter period of time. I didn\u2019t have much time: soon their ritual would be complete, and they\u2019d turn to me.\r  \nThen it would be my turn to hang helplessly upside-down from a tree while a living shadow walked out of that cave to steal my appearance\u2013and my life. \r  \n\rMy arms and legs were numb from whatever I\u2019d been drugged with, but at least I was moving. I groggily pushed one arm forward, then another. I hardly dared to breathe as I crawled at a snail\u2019s pace toward a narrow crevice in the cliffs. If I made a sound or slipped in the muck, or if one of THEM happened to look my way\u2026\r  \nThe roots and rocks in the crevice formed a crude staircase that I was just barely able to climb. Looking over my shoulder, I could see that the chanting group was still focused on Cayden. He had almost completely faded now, replaced by the fifth shadowy shape that danced around the fire with the others. It wouldn\u2019t be long now\u2026\r  \nI ran as fast as my groggy limbs would allow; the forest seemed to go on forever, a nightmare of slick leaves and muck. As I fled, I couldn\u2019t help but imagine those icy hands from my dream closing around my neck\u2026\r  \nSuddenly there were bright lights behind me\u2013and a horrible screeching sound.\r  \nSomeone cursed. A late-night factory worker leaned out the window of her beat-up truck, shaking a fist at me. \r  \nI was so frightened and disoriented that I hadn\u2019t even realized I\u2019d finally found the road. \r  \nShe must\u2019ve seen the terror in my face, because she waved me over and offered me  ride to the police station. Sitting in the interrogation room, wrapped in a blanket with a warm cup of coffee in my hand, I invented a story about how my friend Cayden got lost while hiking.\r  \nFear and whatever poison I\u2019d been given still pounded through my veins, but I at least had the sense to know that, if Cayden showed up dead, I didn\u2019t want to be known to the cops as the crazy guy who wandered out of the night babbling about drugs and shadow people.\r  \nOf course, Cayden didn\u2019t show up dead\u2026although it might have been better if he had. \r  \nHe walked out of the woods a few days later, perfectly healthy, with a big smile on his face\u2013\r  \nAnd a newfound hatred of cameras. \r  \n\r  \n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/beardify)",

    "postText": "\n[Part One]( https://redd.it/brco33)\n\n**** \n\nI thought about the camera above me and took my hand away from my face.  I rolled back to the desk and sat there, trying to stop from shaking, trying to make myself take a breath.  Think about it slow.  The first thing was, should I hit a button?\n\nThe red button was for an emergency.  If she *was* a prisoner or something, and she was trying to escape, they might think that was an emergency.  But no one had been hurt that I knew of.  And I think Mr. Solomon meant save that for something that was like a police or ambulance emergency, not something like this.  But what about the green button?\n\nThis was definitely something \u201cnoteworthy\u201d.  Not only that she was asking for help, but that she was asking *me* for help.  \n\nI made myself stop for a moment.  I couldn\u2019t know for sure she was asking me.  I had gone to school with several boys named Thomas.  It was a common name.  But the chances of her painting that name when I was working here?  I didn\u2019t want to be silly, but I wasn\u2019t trying to be too\u2026what\u2019s that word.  Mom used to say it when she read her angel books.  Skeptics.  I didn\u2019t want to be a skeptic either.  I had to believe it was probably meant for me.  And that was something they would want to know.\n\nBut should I hit the green button?  My hands were drifting toward the metal box on the desk, but I hesitated.  I didn\u2019t like breaking rules, and I was scared of what would happen if I broke these.  If they really were holding her prisoner, then they were probably very bad people.  But I didn\u2019t know that.  Maybe they were good and *she* was bad.  But I just\u2026\n\nI looked back at the monitor for the first time since reading the words.  Rachel was already moving the paintings back off the sofa, as though she knew the message had been received.  A canvas in each hand, she glanced up at the camera as she moved across the room, and it felt like she was looking right at me.  My chest tightened as my hands moved away from the buttons.  \n\nNo.  I didn\u2019t think she was bad.  I had watched her for years.  I felt like I knew her, would know if she was bad.  Strange as it seemed, in a way she was my friend.  And I was going to try and help her.\n\n**** \n\nI spent the rest of my shift trying to act normal and think of what to do.  I knew whoever else was watching might have noticed the paintings or seen how I acted, but I couldn\u2019t worry about that.  I would try to play it cool and try to think how I could help her.\n\nThe only people I had actually met connected to this job were a couple of people when I filled out the papers and then Mr. Solomon when he showed me the model room and told me the job.  I had no way of contacting any of them except through the buttons.  My checks were deposited electronically and I had never run into anyone else who worked at the surveillance room.\n\nThat thought made me stop a second.  I had always thought it was weird that I never ran into someone when I was coming or going\u2014the person I was taking over for or the person who was taking over for me.  I had always figured there must be other people, other surveillance rooms even, and they just scheduled us so we didn\u2019t run into each other.  And I still thought there were others.\n\nPart of why I thought that was because it seemed like I wasn\u2019t the only person who used my surveillance room.  The water cooler, the toilet paper, the soap, they all seemed go down faster than I think I was using it by myself.  If that was true, maybe I could figure out who they were, and maybe they would be safer to talk to than whoever it was that I worked for.\n\nI got off work at eight that night, and instead of grabbing some food and going home, I drove my car around the block and then parked down the street from the building where I worked.  Nothing had changed while I drove around for a minute\u2014no new cars had parked or anything\u2014and if I was right, they didn\u2019t send anyone to replace me until they were sure I was gone anyhow.  \n\nSo I sat and waited.\n\nI was tired and the street was pretty empty and boring, but I was too excited and scared to fall sleep.  Every time a car passed or someone walked down the sidewalk, I tensed.  I kept imagining a SUV or van pulling up behind me.  Men getting out and pulling me from my car, taking me somewhere like where they had Rachel to kill or torture me.  Half a dozen times I almost cranked up and drove away, but every time I would think of her alone in that room.  She had no one but me to help her, and I had to try.\n\nTwo hours later, a fat balding man parked and started heading for the building.  As soon as I saw he was able to unlock the door and enter, I opened my car door to go talk to him.  Then I stopped.  I needed to be smart.  I didn\u2019t know where they were, but I was sure there were hidden cameras in the locker room and outside the building.  If I go running in there and confront that guy, they\u2019ll know for sure that I\u2019m up to something.\n\nSighing with frustration, I shut the door back and waited until his shift was over.  I considered tailing him like in the movies, but I was scared I would just lose him or he would call someone for help.  So I waited until he was walking back to his car after a six hour shift, hopefully far enough away that the cameras wouldn\u2019t see.  And then I met the man I came to know as Charles Jefferies.\n\n**** \n\n\u201cHey\u2026Hey, man, can I talk to you for a minute?\u201d   His back was to me and he just waved his hand absently without looking up.\n\n\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t have any money.  Have a good\u2026\u201d  He froze as he glanced back at me while talking.  \u201cOh God.  No.  No.  You need to get out of here, kid.  We aren\u2019t allowed to talk.\u201d  I could tell he was scared, but I couldn\u2019t risk letting him go yet, not after all this.  I stepped up and pushed the door back shut as he was trying to get into his car.\n\n\u201cSo you know who I am?\u201d  I tried to not sound mean, but I could hear how mad I was in my voice.\n\nHe yanked at the door again, but I was still holding it, and I was stronger than he was.  After a second, weaker tug, he turned around, his face strained and tired-looking.  \u201cYeah, I know who you are.  You work here just like me.  And I\u2019m telling you, we aren\u2019t supposed to be talking.  We aren\u2019t supposed to meet, ever.\u201d\n\nI frowned.  \u201cMr. Solomon never told me that.  He never said it was one of the rules.\u201d\n\nThe man shook his head.  \u201cMr. Solomon.  Yeah.  Well there are plenty of rules they don\u2019t tell you.  I bet they didn\u2019t tell you what you were going to be watching before you started, did they?\u201d  When I just lowered my eyes, he went on.  \u201cYeah, me either.  I\u2019ve been at this job for ten years.  I\u2019ve seen other people come and go, usually because they broke one those rules they never mentioned.  The only reason I\u2019m still here is because I keep my head down and my mouth shut.\u201d  He wagged a finger at me.  \u201cYou should do the same, if it\u2019s not already too late.\u201d\n\nI felt my stomach curling into a cold knot.  \u201cToo late?\u201d\n\nThe man rubbed his face.  \u201cKid, do you think they don\u2019t know we\u2019re talking?  Do you think anything happens that they don\u2019t know about?\u201d  He looked back toward the building, a look of sadness and fear in his eyes.  \u201cHell, for all I know, you\u2019ve already killed us both.\u201d  Shaking his head, he pushed me back and started opening the door.  \u201cEither way, I\u2019m done risking it.  You need to stop asking questions and just do your job.  It\u2019s a lot healthier.\u201d\n\nWith that, he got into his car and shut the door.  I didn\u2019t try to stop him this time.  Even though I had already been worried about what he was telling me, hearing it confirmed was paralyzing.  What exactly was my plan?  He probably didn\u2019t know any more than I did, and even if he did, what could I do with anything he told me?\n\nI walked back to my car with a heavy heart.  I was still afraid, but more than that, I was sad and ashamed.  I wanted to help Rachel, but I wasn\u2019t sure how.  I wasn\u2019t giving up, but as I drove back to my apartment, I couldn\u2019t think of what I should do next.  This wasn\u2019t a movie.  I wasn\u2019t a hero.  And the only ideas I had left were to either go to the police, who might be controlled by whoever I worked for, or try to get proof of her being held prisoner myself.\n\nAs I parked my car and walked into my apartment building, I made a decision.  Unless I thought of something better overnight, I would do both ideas.  Tomorrow I would break the rule about carrying anything in.  I\u2019d use my phone to record a video of the surveillance room, of Rachel and how she was trapped somewhere, and of me telling everything else I knew.  And I would email it to every newspaper, website, and internet channel I could think of.  I\u2019d then go to the police and give them a copy too if I could make it that long without getting caught.  Maybe if I did all that, even if they got me, someone would help Rachel.\n\nI was filled with worry and dread at the idea of being hurt or killed.  A part of me kept saying I should just do as I was told and hope that it all went away.  But I couldn\u2019t live with myself if I did that.  Even if I messed up, I felt like I had to try.  I was so preoccupied that I didn\u2019t hear the person coming up behind me as I unlocked my apartment door.\n\n\u201cThomas?\u201d\n\nI turned around and felt my legs weaken as I stumbled back against my door.  I had to be dreaming or crazy.  I grabbed the door knob for support as I looked at the woman in front of me.  It couldn\u2019t be her, but somehow it was.\n\n[\u201cRachel?\u201d](https://redd.it/9ndww5)\n\n****\n\n[Part Three](https://redd.it/bsg2az)",

He keeps referring to his mother \"mother always said if something is too good to be true it problably is.\" and \"what was that word that my mother used to use? I think it was skeptical?\"  \n\n  \n\nAnother noteworthy point that stuck out to me is when he confronts the guy in the parking lot. He said he was a fat balding guy. So the guy was probably in his 40s-50s and was larger. But Thomas said he was able to easily shut the door and hold it shut against his will because he was stronger than him.  \n\n  \n\nThis really leads me to picture Thomas as being one of those larger type guys that is mildly slow and a mamas boy.

His grandfather is a retired PI and he asked me for any info I could give him and he\u2019d see if he could locate him for me. I knew his name and birthdate and last known address. He emails me the next day with his address, email address and phone number! So I reached out and sure enough, that\u2019s him. Lives two blocks away from my son in Richardson! \n\nYeah, you guys do a valuable service!  The ones calling you peeping toms are probably the guys caught sucking somebody\u2019s dick!",

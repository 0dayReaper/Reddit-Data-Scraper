    "postText": "\n\nA couple months ago me and my friends went on a camping trip. We had a small trailer and there was five of us, small enough to barley fit in the trailer but we managed. We liked to swim in the lake, go on hikes, that kind of stuff. We often told campfire story\u2019s at night. They were never that scary. That was until one night we were all sitting down at the camp fire talking, drinking and snacking having fun. It was pitch black out with the only light source being the orange glow of the campfire. \n\nWe were surrounded by thick bush with a small trail leading to the main path area. We were beside the public bathroom area that was connected to the path. As we were all listening to one of my friends telling a campfire story, a tall pale man wearing old worn clothing and a cowboy hat with one of those big backpacks came out of the path. He interrupted asking if he could listen to the story, my friend (let\u2019s call him drew) didn\u2019t think much of it and politely said yes. Me, a bit suspicious, moved over to a log placed beside my friends chair a bit away from him. I sat down and he continued on with his story. \n\nA few minutes later he Finnished the story and the man who came in , asked if he could tell a story. He explained  it\u2019s not like any other story, it\u2019s one that will leave you sick in the stomach, one that will make you scared to fall asleep at night. \n\nThey said sure and shrugged it off. Me, feeling a bit weirded out by the whole situation, told them I was going to use the bathroom. I went down the path as he began his story. I walk in the bathroom and go on my phone for a couple minutes I hear the old mysterious mans muffled voice in the background. After about ten minutes passed, I walked back to the area to see my friends staring blankly into nothing as if they had seen or heard something horrible. \n\nThe man was gone and it was completely devoid of any sound other than the faint crackle of the fire. I laughed it off and asked them what the man had told them. Drew, looking like he just saw a ghost just told me the man was sick walked off to his bed in the trailer. The other ones seemed pretty out of it as well. I didn\u2019t really think it was a joke at this point. They put out the fire and walked back to the trailer. I put out the fire and got into the trailer. A couple minutes after I finnaly got comfortable, one of them groaned and insisted we slept with the lights on. I gave him a funny grin and he got really mad and told me that we don\u2019t know what could be out there at night time. I shrugged it off and turned on the lights. \n\nAs we started to sleep one of them jolts out of their bed and the other ones all quickly looked at him in fear. He explained he woke up from a bad dream, drew got up and said he can\u2019t do this anymore. The other ones were just as paraniod. I was starting to wonder what they had heard. I told them to just go to bed and they would be fine in the morning. I fall do sleep after about 20 minutes. They were still completely out of it. Around 3:20 I heard a loud thud. I looked around and they were all still up and biting their nails and looking around anxiously. I was still half asleep so I just went back to bed. \n\nThe next morning would be the night that will be forever burned into my memory. I woke up to find every one of them mangled beyond recognition. They were stretched and twisted , their face was completely frozen in the most disturbing facial expressions I have ever seen in my life. \n\nTheir fingers were crooked and their body was covered in blood. I screamed in complete horror as I ran out of the trailer. I didn\u2019t call 911 I just started my car and drove out of that place as fast as I can. It\u2019s been a few months and it\u2019s still not on the news. I don\u2019t know what they heard that night but what ever it was, I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t listen. If you see this crooked pale man, please, please respectfully leave.",

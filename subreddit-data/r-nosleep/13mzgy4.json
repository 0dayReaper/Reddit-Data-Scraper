    "postText": "\n______\n\nI remember when I was a little boy sitting in catholic school the deacon taught us all about the circles of hell. \n\nEach one more terrible and torturous than the last. \nI was so worried about going to Hell that I went to church every Sunday after that. \nBut hell isn\u2019t just some place in a book. For me and several others, it\u2019s a claustrophobic elevator that is surrounded by an otherworldly entity. \n\nThis being, monster, or whatever you want to call it; is circling us. The way a predator plays with its wounded prey. \nI\u2019m certain of this now as I sit in a nightmarish elevator alongside two people that I once called strangers. \n\nChlo\u00e9 and Phil. \n\nNick is gone. \n\nI\u2019m going to try my best to transcribe what happened to him.\n\nAt some point [after](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13lzwug/im_trapped_in_a_basement_elevator_alongside/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=15) we tried to open the hatch on the roof, I woke up with the worst headache ever. \nThe others were all trying their best to recover as well, coughing and wheezing, all of us feeling the effects of the mist that clouded our lungs. \n\nI looked up at the open hole where the hatch dangled freely. Taunting us with an exit that we couldn\u2019t reach. I could see the railings of the elevator that winded upward into a bright light but there was no telling how far down we were. \n\nNow that there are only four of us we don\u2019t have enough height to reach the hatch. \n\nNo means of escape anymore, I realize. \n\nI can\u2019t help but to call out to Sidney. I hope against the odds that she made it up and is above us somewhere. \n\n\u201cPlease keep climbing!!\u201d I shouted. \n\n\u201cWho are you yelling at?\u201d a voice to my left asks. \n\nNick is more alert now, he is resting on the floor with the door at his back. The bruises from where Phil and I attempted to interrogate him are more prominent and I feel a twist in my gut for what I did to him. But only partially because I still don\u2019t fully trust him. \n\n\u201cSidney\u2026 maybe she made it to the lobby, maybe we can get out of here,\u201d I told him. \n\nThe army private sighs and rubs his crushed hand. It\u2019s clear the shock has worn off and now he is in excruciating pain. \n\n\u201cAnd who exactly is Sidney?\u201d he asks. \n\nThat unsettling feeling I\u2019ve had in my gut starts to return and I look at him. I search his face for any signs that he is lying. But like before, it\u2019s clear he has no memory of her. I try my best to jog his memory. \n\n\u201cShe was a nurse. She set your hand and helped Phil with his burns,\u201d I said turning to the maintenance man. He is beginning to wake up as well, looking like he has aged ten years in ten minutes. \n\n\u201cI\u2026 I think I remember her,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 admits as she stands up and massages her back. Her hair is a mess and there is blood on her clothes. \n\nAll of us look like we are on death\u2019s door. \n\n\u201cEli must be telling the truth because I don\u2019t have any medical experience and I don\u2019t think anyone else here does. So how else could I have healed?\u201d Phil asked. \n\n\u201cBut none of us have a recollection of her face\u2026?\u201d I realize as I massage my own head. I can remember her name still but the fact that the other details are missing terrifies me. \n\n\u201cBefore that\u2026 before this Sidney disappeared, you said that there was another woman here too,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 tells me. \n\nI suddenly realized that I don\u2019t remember her at all. But I can see in Chlo\u00e9\u2019s face that she is truthful. \n\n\u201cMy phone\u2026 I\u2019ve been taking notes of everything. Trying to keep my sanity\u2026 it has details of what has happened to us,\u201d I said as I reached into my pocket and pulled it out. But the phone is dead. \n\n\n\u201cI believe you\u2026 but I don\u2019t think I can remember\u2026 we have been here too long, and that mist whatever it was must have clouded our minds,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 comments. \n\nAll of us are silent for a very tense moment as we consider what the implications are. No one is brave enough to voice it, not at first. But when the tension is clearly at a boiling point,  Nick laughs. \n\nIt echoes throughout the elevator, sending an uneasy chill down my spine. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so amusing?\u201d Phil asks irritably. \n\n\u201cI was just thinking of this local ghost story. It kinda correlated with our predicament,\u201d he said. \n\nI slump down and cross my arms. I\u2019m tired but we have nothing else to do to pass the time so I prompt him to tell us. \n\n\u201cIt will get our minds off this hell,\u201d I tell him. \n\nNick shrugs and tells the story. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a building nearby, an old boarded up escape room\u2026 People say that a group of teenagers locked themselves in the building and then they killed each other. That\u2019s the official story\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cBut there were other versions that circled the internet which claimed supernatural forces were at work. Magick that was forbidden which sealed them inside. And that the room itself was alive and devoured them one by one.\u201d\n\nAll of us say nothing as the air feels sucked out of the room and he continues. \n\n\u201cThe room had become sentient and could see their darkest fears. Their deepest desires. And it realized the only way out\u2026 the only salvation that anyone has that will free any of us from suffering\u2026 was death.\u201d \n\nHis words fell with a sickening fury as I realized what he was implying. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a stupid story. You might be ready to die but no one else is,\u201d I said as I looked toward the gun. He could lunge for it if he really wanted to even though he was still tied down. \n\n\u201cAll I\u2019m suggesting is that we be given the dignity to choose how we end things,\u201d Nick said. \u201cNo one actually gets to have that choice. I think it\u2019s fate that I\u2019m the one here with a gun to give us that chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one is going to agree to that,\u201d Phil said. \n\n\u201cI have my kids. I have to try to get out of here,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 said, her lips trembling. Nick laughed again. \n\n\u201cWhen are you going to stop fooling yourself and realize that you will never see them again?\u201d\n\nHe gestured his crushed hand around the tiny space we were trapped in. \u201cThis is all that\u2019s left. A pit of darkness where we will rot away and be forgotten by everyone and everything,\u201d Nick told us. \n\nMy mind is spiraling as I look at the gun. Was he right? Were we delaying the inevitable?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fate that I\u2019m here. Because I was planning on dying today anyway,\u201d Nick says, a disturbing truth taking shape. \n\nThe rest of us give uncomfortable looks at each other. \n\n\u201cThis gun\u2026 it was for you? That\u2019s the secret you\u2019ve been keeping?\u201d Phil guesses. \n\nNick is silent again. \u201cI told you before that it doesn\u2019t matter. None of this matters,\u201d he finally says. \n\nI felt awful as I realized that he wanted us to hate him earlier because it gave him some excuse for whatever reason he hated himself. \n\n\u201cAnd the food and the supplies? Were you going to camp out here until you could get the courage to pull the trigger?\u201d I asked. \n\nBefore he gets a chance to answer we feel the elevator buckle again. Everyone is freezing, panicking. We look up to the open hatch, frightened that the monster could easily reach in to snatch us out. \n\nInstead the power comes on and suddenly the elevator doors open. Before we can realize what is happening, Nick fumbles backward into the open void. \n\nI jumped and grabbed at his legs before he was completely gone, wrapping my arms around him as I peer out to the endless chasm below. \n\nI feel a dizzy and sickening sensation cover me as I realize that the elevator is just barely hanging on to the exterior of the long empty shaft. If it drops again we may plummet forever. \n\nNone of that I can focus on as I struggle to pull Nick back into the elevator. Phil and Chlo\u00e9 help me and we manage to finally get him back into the small room. We hear the monster somewhere below us and I panic to try and get the door closed. \n\n\u201cUntie me,\u201d Nick tells the others. \n\nChlo\u00e9 listens to him and he reaches for the gun, turning it toward the open door as the scales of the monster return. \n\nIt is rushing past at lightning speed and we can\u2019t see where the beast begins or ends. The entire elevator feels like it is being crushed and he aims the gun at the beast and waits for it to open its mouth. \n\nShooting it straight it\u2019s ghastly bowels, the beast shrieks and the elevator groans and I pray to god that we don\u2019t fall. \nBut god doesn\u2019t listen. \n\nThe machinery groans and the elevator slides down the side of the empty shaft at dizzying speeds. I feel myself slam against the ceiling. Chlo\u00e9 reaches for my hand as we feel the elevator speeding up. It is like a thrill ride from hell and we don\u2019t know when it will end. \n\nI can\u2019t tell you how long we actually fell. I think I blacked out a few times as the levels sped by. All I could feel was agony and pain. Then at last we slammed against the floor. The bottom of the elevator cracks apart and buckles. Parts of the wall bend. \n\nMy head hits the wall but somehow I remain conscious as I try to move toward the door. I confirm that we have officially reached the bottom. It reminds me of a grave with bones and flesh scattered everywhere and I can\u2019t help wondering if this is where the beast nests. There is nothing else to see except the long tall shaft above us. Somehow I am shocked to see that the railing of the elevator is still holding. But I have no confidence it will do anything anymore. \n\nI stumble inside the elevator and slump against the wall, my body aching and my mind shattered. \n\nEverything Nick just said feels like a grim reality. \n\nBut amid the chaos, I notice that Phil is using his tools on the damaged electrical panel that flung open. The slam against the floor has completely messed up the walls of the elevator, revealing the emergency wiring behind the frame. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re wasting your time,\u201d Nick argues as he sits up and we watch the maintenance man work on the connections. \n\n\u201cShut up. It\u2019s better than doing nothing,\u201d The maintenance man snaps back. \n\n\u201cI offered a solution already,\u201d Nick said as he waved his gun around. \n\n\u201cPut that thing away!\u201d I said frantically. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help that I\u2019ve come to terms with what is going to happen to us,\u201d Nick said as he looked at the weapon. \n\n\u201cI deserve to die anyway\u2026\u201d he whispered. \n\nChlo\u00e9 has more patience than us and slides down alongside the soldier. \n\n\u201cSurely there is someone out there that still needs you,\u201d she said. \n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re wasting your time. You don\u2019t know anything about me or what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve hurt people. For all you know I have killed people,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cBut you said it yourself none of that matters anymore,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 argued. \n\nNick doesn\u2019t respond. I don\u2019t know if her words are getting to him but she keeps talking anyway. \n\n\u201cThis is a chance for a clean slate. Or a second chance. We can\u2019t give up now. There is still time. If we give up we let that monster win,\u201d she says. \n\nHe looks down at the ground, trying to not have a breakdown. \u201cDo you honestly believe that the world above us still cares at all?\u201d \n\n\u201cI have to believe something. Don\u2019t you believe in anything?\u201d she asks. \n\nNick shakes his head and doesn\u2019t respond. \n\nThen the elevator shakes again and I hear Phil shout excitedly. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got it working!\u201d \n\nI turn to see that the elevator is actually rising again and for the first time in days I feel a surge of hope fill my body. \n\nAll of us stand up, even Nick. We are slowly beginning to ascend and it feels like reason to celebrate. \n\nBut it is short lived. There is a spark from the electrical panel and fire bursts from the controls. \n\nAs a result, the doors remain open as we continue upward. All of us feel a sense of dread again as Nick voices the obvious. \u201cEventually we will collide with that thing. And then it will be game over,\u201d he says. \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know that,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 whispers but her voice is cracking. \n\nNick shakes his head and cocks the gun, placing it against his head. \n\n\u201cI should have done this days ago,\u201d he declares. \n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t. What about the people who have already lost their lives? That woman\u2026 she sacrificed herself to save you!\u201d I stuttered. \n\n\u201cThen maybe I can buy all of you some time when the beastie gets close. Throw my corpse to its hungry jaws. Could give you an opportunity to slip by,\u201d he says. \n\nHe passes his backpack to me and says, \u201cThere's a few supplies left in there for all of you for maybe a few more days and even a lightning charger for that phone of yours.\u201d \n\nMy mouth feels dry. \n\n\u201cI thought you said this didn\u2019t matter,\u201d I told him, hoping he will stop this madness. \n\n\u201cYou matter. All of you,\u201d he decided as he stood away from all of us. \n\n\u201cThank you for giving me the courage to do this,\u201d he tells Chlo\u00e9. \n\nThen he puts the gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger.\n\n[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13o09nb/im_trapped_in_a_basement_elevator_alongside/?)",

    "postText": "Jesus, I hope this doesn\u2019t get turned into a TikTok with Subway Surfers content playing in the background. I can\u2019t imagine what would happen if one of these things saw this through their social media feed and Reset me.\r  \n\r  \nI apologize, but I don\u2019t really know how to start one of these things off. Everyone here seems to be so certain of themselves when talking about their horrific experiences here, and I\u2019ve typed up seven separate options for the introduction and discarded all of them. What am I even supposed to say? \u2018Am I the Asshole for not believing murderous cryptids when they tell me I\u2019m their sibling?\u2019\r  \n\r  \nThe thing is. I wasn\u2019t always an only child. Years before the things found me, I had a brother and sister. They were twins, and always at eachothers throats. I was the youngest by nine years, and found myself caught in the crossfire between the two of them more often than not. They went off to college when I was six due to some sort of early graduation program.\r  \n\r  \nMy mom was in despair after they left. She had always felt closer to the two of them, as they had been closer in age to her and enjoyed writing as much as she did. I guess having a math nerd as a child when you\u2019re a famous author is disappointing.\r  \n\r  \nIf my dad was upset, he didn\u2019t show it. He\u2019s a traditional man, and thinks that he\u2019s responsible for providing for the family even though my mom makes more than enough for all five of us. He\u2019s constantly on trips, and so the two of us never grew close. \r  \n\r  \nMy relationship with them got worse after the accident. I had blown up at both of my siblings because eleven-year-old me didn\u2019t think she was getting enough attention from our family. They tried to push it off at first, claiming that I was just being the attention seeking youngest. \r  \n\r  \nAnd then I stopped talking. It wasn\u2019t a silent treatment, but that\u2019s what they saw it as. For some reason, I had become mute (or nonverbal, I have no idea how to distinguish one from another without a doctor\u2019s diagnosis) some time after the argument. My parents brushed it off for a few days, but when school continued and I still wasn\u2019t speaking they grew concerned. They had my siblings come home, and told me that we would all talk it out and spend some time together.\r  \n\r  \nMy parents had grown frustrated when I didn\u2019t speak even when they came home, and told my siblings to leave as to not encourage me further. For probably the first time in their lives, they agreed on something. My sister\u2019s car broke down, and so they both took my brother\u2019s car back to the college.\r  \n\r  \nWe learned that they died about five hours later. They apparently both stopped to get some drinks in order to \u2018de-stress\u2019 after the argument, and had gotten into an accident not a mile from the bar. My parents never admitted to blaming me, but they didn\u2019t try to hide how they felt, either.\r  \n\r  \nMy mom hit a writer's block soon after that, which my dad used as an excuse to go on \u2018business trips\u2019. We all knew he just wanted to get away from Kate and Neil\u2019s ghosts.\r  \n\r  \nBut my family trauma isn\u2019t what I\u2019m here to discuss. This all had to do with the phone call I got a year ago. I was about to turn sixteen at the time, and had assumed that the phone call I received was a birthday call from some distant family member that had taken pity on me. \r  \n\r  \nMy sibling sang Happy Birthday to me for the first time. I panicked, before realizing that someone from my school likely programmed AI voices to creep me out, as I wasn\u2019t exactly well liked. I was pissed off, though, and decided to snap at them.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI don\u2019t know who the hell you are, but if you think that this is going to upset me you\u2019re wrong. Your shitty AI doesn\u2019t quite capture their pretentious tones. And if this is Maddie on the other end of the line, I hope that you also receive the pleasure of having your asshole siblings die,\u201d I snapped.\r  \n\r  \nI know now how absolutely pitiful it sounds, but I was still in shock from hearing their voices and could hardly keep my voice from shaking.\r  \n\r  \nInstead of whoever it was on the other end of the line laughing, or hanging up, they bickered amongst themselves. Their voices initially sounded like my siblings, but abruptly changed to two very different sounding people. I was only able to make out a few phrases, but I\u2019ll record them here anyways in case I\u2019m Reset.\r  \n\r  \n\u201c-asshole siblings-\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThey could just be saying that to make us hang up.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIt should have Charmed her.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201c You can try tomorrow.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201c---- forget?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cJust Reset her.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cShe isn\u2019t ready for that.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cFine. Wait. Give \u2014--- dad.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI was very close to hanging up when I heard my dad\u2019s voice. I was suspicious of this being yet another AI at first, but he comforted me and told me that there were kids playing around with the technology at his job. They had, apparently, heard that it was my birthday and decided to use the first voices in his phone to surprise me - unknowing of the damage they had caused.\r  \n\r  \nIt still didn't explain why they had called him dad. Unless, of course, he had a long-standing affair with another woman. I didn\u2019t care enough to do anything about it, but I did wonder if that would be enough to get the two of them to finally divorce with one another. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cDo you know these kids?\u201d I asked, attempting to keep my tone light. I knew that he wasn\u2019t going to confess, but wanted to mess with him anyway. I was, as many rising freshmen are, very spiteful.\r  \n\r  \nMy dad, unsurprisingly, hesitated.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThey are some close family members. I do hope you can forgive them. They\u2019re hoping to see you soon, you know - I\u2019ve told them all about you. I was thinking that we could all five go to that new library they\u2019ve just built. The two of them are real book nerds, just like you.\u201d he said, laughing.\r  \n\r  \nI sat there, absolutely dumbfounded for a moment. There was no way that he had the gall to do something like that if those kids were my half-siblings.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cLooking forward to it,\u201d I said, before hanging up. Everything about that conversation felt unnatural, but I didn\u2019t feel like looking into it too much. My dad and mom could deal with each other. I\u2019d already done enough to improve the quality of our family dynamic.\r  \n\r  \nI didn\u2019t realize that I had spoken. It felt so natural, and I remember my voice being completely clear, as if I had never stopped speaking at all. I believe that this was my first mistake, but knowing these things I could have messed up long before it.\r  \n\r  \nI decided to go to sleep. As my dad had promised that he would be home the next morning and my Mom was fussing over her latest project. Apparently, a burst of inspiration had struck her a few hours ago, which I wasn\u2019t about to discourage. Hopefully it would tone down her moping.\r  \n\r  \nNot being concerned when my alarm clock didn\u2019t work the next morning may have been my second mistake, because when I came downstairs at ten o\u2019 clock my dad was sitting at the table with two teenagers. Two twin boys, one with slicked back hair and calculating eyes and the other who looked like he hadn\u2019t brushed his hair in years. I decided to head back upstairs, as I could only assume that this all had something to do with my dad\u2019s work in some way.\r  \n\r  \nI hadn\u2019t gotten three steps up the stairs when he called me downstairs. I sighed and entered the room. Apparently, him not ignoring me wasn\u2019t a one-time thing. This was going to be a pain to deal with. I looked at the two boys with suspicion. They did not seem old enough to be working with my father.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOh, Hattie! I should have introduced you to these two. These are your cousins, William and Arlo.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe more serious looking cousin smiled cooly, and clarified that he was Arlo. William sat by him, happily swinging his feet like some sort of overstimulated toddler. I looked at the two of them, deciding on whether or not I wanted to mess with my dad despite the kindness he had been showing this past day.\r  \n\r  \nA day doesn\u2019t make up for fifteen years, I decided, and dug my heels into this conversation. Hopefully I could get the two of them out of here before lunch.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDad, I don\u2019t remember you mentioning any cousins to me,\u201d I said, giving him a shit-eating grin. I wasn\u2019t sure if the two of them were in on whatever he was doing, but I became more sure that they were when they exchanged a nervous glance with one another.\r  \n\r  \nMy dad looked at me, perplexed.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOf course you remember them. I used to tell you about them all the time. They just couldn\u2019t afford to visit us then and your mother didn\u2019t like to travel. Don\u2019t you remember calling them all of the time? You thought that they were the coolest people in the world, even though they were only three years older than you.\u201d he said. I paused for a moment, wondering if he was aware of the bullshit he was currently spewing out.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIt was Niel that didn\u2019t like to travel,\u201d I said. I saw the two cousins flinch. That seemed less suspicious to me, as they likely knew now that they had accidentally prank-called me using the voices of my dead siblings.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNiel?\u201d my dad asked, seeming perplexed. I was just about to snap at him for not remembering something so crucial about one of his children when Arlo grabbed me by the wrist.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDon\u2019t you have to be at work?\u201d he asked my dad, \u201cI know Hattie has a day off of school, but your work started an hour ago. You should hurry and leave.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI don\u2019t know what happened to my dad in that moment, but he seemed to look far to afraid for a man who was only late for look. He practically sprinted out of the door, before William called out to him.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNot going to say goodbye to your favorite daughter?\u201d he asked with an easy smile. My dad spun around, wishing me well and hugging me for the first time in years. He glanced at my cousin, who nodded, before leaving.\r  \n\r  \nArlo\u2019s hand was back on my wrist. It must have let go when I was hugging my dad. He squeezed his hand. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was supposed to be comforting or not, but William\u2019s smile put me at ease. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m surprised that you don\u2019t remember us at all, Hattie. We just slept over at your house a few weeks ago, remember?\u201d he asked, his hold on my hand becoming more forceful. I wasn\u2019t sure why he was doing it, but it made me uneasy enough that I nodded my head in agreement despite the fact that I had never seen this kid before.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. My memory tends to be a bit fuzzy since everything happened with my siblings. I think I remember you guys now,\u201d I said, smiling sheepishly. William seemed overjoyed with this response, and Arlo loosened the pressure on my wrist. I allowed myself to relax a little bit. My family were never big travelers with how Niel was in planes. Maybe people where they were often expressed themselves like this.\r  \n\r  \nI didn\u2019t like the way his finger rested over the veins of my wrist, as if he was checking my pulse. It was making me feel dizzy. I shook myself out of the suspicion. Maybe it was a tradition where they were from, and I was being a Xenophobic asshole. \r  \n\r  \nArlo studied my expression. I tried to school it into something more neutral.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you had siblings, Hattie,\u201d he said, his voice oddly melodic. I felt a sensation of calm run through my body, though I\u2019m not sure why. I relaxed and gave him a smile.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOh. My apologies, you\u2019re right,\u201d I said before I had realized the words I had spoken. I went to correct myself and clarify that I did have siblings, and that they just happened to be underground, but decided against it. Who cared about Niel and\u2026\r  \n\r  \nMy other brother? Yes, right, I had two brothers who passed, Niel and Wilbur. I felt a pang of guilt for forgetting about them so easily.\r  \n\r  \nWilliam gave me a reassuring smile before telling Arlo to release my wrist. He did, surprisingly, and my thoughts became more distinct. The shithead was probably cutting off my circulation.\r  \n\r  \nMy ears began to ring. Was that a symptom of bad circulation? I wasn\u2019t sure. I had never been interested in science. I was far more inclined to writing.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDo we have her, Arlo?\u201d he asked softly. Arlo nodded with a satisfied hum, which made William\u2019s never-ending smile brighten even more. I wished that I could be on whatever this guy was. He seemed like a little ball of sunshine despite the fact that he was easily seventeen.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThey were more difficult than the others. The parents were too distant from their child to reform them as a unit. We\u2019ll have to take more care when processing her if we want to keep her mind open to future transfers,\u201d Arlo said, looking at me as if I was some sort of specimen that a child had pinned to their \u2018bug collection\u2019 project. I shifted under the weight of his gaze. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cSorry, I\u2019m not following this conversation. If this is a personal conversation, I can give you guys some privacy,\u201d I offered, hoping to get out of the room as politely as possible. If my dad was willing to be so kind to me just to prove something to these cousins, I could only imagine what would happen if I severed relationships with them.\r  \n\r  \nWilliam let out an audible gasp, before steeling himself. Arlo took a step closer to me.\r  \n\r  \nDefinitely not the right choice on my behalf. Fuck, I thought, praying that I could salvage the situation.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to be rude. I just didn\u2019t want to intrude on your conversation if it was\u2026\u201d I started to say, before WIlliam interrupted me. He looked like I had kicked his puppy.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI thought you couldn\u2019t hear us,\u201d he muttered, his smile fading. I shook my head.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOh, my ears were ringing if that\u2019s what you meant. But I feel fine. If you need me to go, then\u2026\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI could feel the room darkening around me. I heard William call out to Arlo, who only acknowledged him with a distant hum. I didn\u2019t realize that I was falling until a pair of arms caught me, holding me with all of the care of a vivo tester.\r  \n\r  \nI tried to open my eyes, and was met with two glowing lights shaped oddly like eyes. I was surely hallucinating. My desire to stay awake faded with this revelation.\r  \n\r  \nMy brothers would surely take me to the hospital.\r  \n\r  \n I resigned myself to unconsciousness.\r  \n\r  \nNot being concerned when my alarm clock didn\u2019t work the next morning must have been a mistake, because when I came downstairs at ten o\u2019 clock my dad was sitting at the table with two teenagers. Two twin boys, one with slicked back hair and calculating eyes and the other who looked like he hadn\u2019t groomed himself in years. I decided to head back upstairs, as I could only assume that this all had something to do with my dad\u2019s work in some way.\r  \n\r  \nI hadn\u2019t gotten three steps up the stairs when he called me downstairs. I sighed and entered the room. Apparently, him not ignoring me wasn\u2019t a one-time thing. This was going to be a pain to deal with. I looked at the two boys with suspicion. They did not seem old enough to be working with my father.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to say hello to your brothers?\u201d he asked me, and I looked over to the two boys sitting up at the counter. I had never seen them before, and was unsure of what my father was hinting at. I waved at the two of them shily, and became even more confused when the look on both of their faces brightened significantly - as if I was some sort of celebrity.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSorry, do I know you two?\u201d I asked, trying to recall where I may have seen the two of them before. I felt something on the edge of my memory, but I couldn\u2019t quite grasp it. If I had seen them before, it wasn\u2019t recent.\r  \n\r  \nMy dad laughed. He hadn\u2019t done that in years.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou and your practical jokes, Hattie. I have to head off to work, but I\u2019ll see you three later,\u201d he said, ruffling Williams\u2019 hair before walking out of the door. The air became noticeably colder when the garage door shut.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWilliam,\u201d Arlo said, sounding perplexed. WIlliam looked at him and nodded - though he didn\u2019t seem happy. I hoped that I hadn\u2019t offended him.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou\u2019re a pretty tough one, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Arlo asked, grabbing my wrist. I recoiled without thinking, unsure of what I had done wrong. He looked infuriated.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d I asked, intending for it to sound like an apology but instead turning it into a question. William sighed.\r  \n\r  \nI think that I noticed how absolutely fucked I was when the stranger placed his finger over my wrist, feeling my pulse. Someone had done it before, and though I wasn\u2019t sure who it was, I knew that it wasn\u2019t a particularly safe person.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cShe isn\u2019t aware, but she didn\u2019t set it up correctly,\u201d Arlo muttered, \u201cI guess we ought to reset again\u201d. \r  \n\r  \nHe looked cold and cruel. So much so that I tried to withdraw my hand. A wave of dizziness hit me upon the attempt, and the darkness clouding my vision gave me a terrible feeling of deja vu.\r  \n\r  \nTwo red lights, and this time I was not unwell enough to doubt what I was seeing. Arlo looked sickly. Inhumanly so. I tried to right myself in order to help my brother.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cShe seems to be accepting it,\u201d William commented, seemingly oddly optimistic for a person whose twin had turned a sickly pale shade, his eyes glowing.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNot enough,\u201d Arlo said stubbornly, causing WIlliam to laugh.\r  \n\r  \nArlo smiled. A liquid that I could only assume to be blood coated his all too sharp teeth. Something was wrong with my brother, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I should help him or run. I looked around, unsure of what to do, and caught something odd in my peripheral vision.\r  \n\r  \nMy hands were coated in blood. It was so clotted that instead of dripping off of my hands it fell off in clumsy chunks onto the kitchen floor. I tried to scream and found myself unable to make noise.\r  \n\r  \nWas I awake?\r  \n\r  \n\u201cQuit taunting the child, Arlo,\u201d WIlliam said sternly, and the blood faded. Arlo looked healthier too, much to my relief.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNeeded to scare her before I reset. It speeds things up. I learned from the best,\u201d he said, grinning cockily.\r  \n\r  \nNot being concerned when my alarm clock didn\u2019t work the next morning was likely the best thing that could have happened to me. I looked down at my hands, which were pristine. Too pristine, in fact.\r  \n\r  \nI could feel the phantom feeling of warm, thick liquid coating it. Blood. I shook my head. I was being dramatic, a right reserved to my mother and her books. I had never been one to write or read.\r  \n\r  \nWhy had my dad called me a book nerd, then?\r  \n\r  \nI felt my fear before I understood it. I didn\u2019t like books, and I didn\u2019t read. I was a calculated mathematician, taking Calculus Two in the tenth grade despite the fact that I was nearly failing my on-level English class. My dad hadn\u2019t tried to get me into reading since my siblings had died.\r  \n\r  \nI heard voices downstairs. Two young teens, about the same age as my siblings had been when the accident had happened.\r  \n\r  \nThe accident.\r  \n\r  \nI didn\u2019t have siblings, a fact which felt unnatural to me. I wasn\u2019t sure what was going on, but my gut was telling me that going downstairs was not a good idea. I didn\u2019t understand until I heard William tell my dad that he was going to \u2018wake up his sister\u2019.\r  \n\r  \nI remember, now. It hit me when I was pretending to be asleep, acting content enough to make that poor bastard's spineless self hesitate before leaving the room. I nearly screamed, and ended up turning around \u2018in my sleep\u2019 because I couldn\u2019t bear to be facing away from Arlo's brother. I was glad that Arlo hadn\u2019t waken me up. If that freak had checked me for my pulse, he would have known that I was not only awake, but aware of what he was.\r  \n\r  \nI don\u2019t know how long I have until they come up here to wake me up again. I do not know how time works with these things works, but I hope that I will be able to regain my memories if I see this post after another reset.",

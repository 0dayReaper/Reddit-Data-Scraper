I\u2019m not the type to sugar coat things, he\u2019s in a pretty sorry state, but he\u2019s going to pull through. He\u2019s a tough bastard. \r\n\r\nIn case you haven\u2019t clued in yet, it\u2019s Mike, I might not be as much of a wordsmith as Kev but I think I can keep your interest. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was about five foot four, pale greasy skin and pitch colored hair that was just about to cross the double line from shiny into gross. Early thirties I\u2019d guess, but with the strange shit Kev and I have gotten ourselves into she could be a million, or put together yesterday for all I know. \r\n\r\nShe was a \u201c Shame Monger\u201d which was as esoteric of a job title as it sounds, and the first context me and my little buddy had on our current assignment. \r\n\r\nThe place we\u2019re in is an old, decrepit arcade, I\u2019m surrounded by shadowy figures sticking to the dark recesses like insects. \r\n\r\nKev is somewhere deep within the place sticking his neck out with God knows what ( I mean, I do as well, but I\u2019ll let Kevin relay shit when he\u2019s up to it.), and I\u2019m making small talk. \r\n\r\n\u201cYou human? \u201c I say, she\u2019s not offended but raises an eyebrow. \r\n\r\n\u201cAre you? \u201c She has an edge to her, human or not, she\u2019s seen some shit. \r\n\r\nI laugh, running a hand over the branded lines mimicking clown patterns Art left me with after that stay in his gulag. \r\n\r\n\u201cSometimes I forget about the braille. \r\n\r\nYeah, %100 sadly. \u201c I lean on the counter as I speak. \r\n\r\n\u201cMe too, you haven\u2019t been working with the watchers long, have you? \u201c She sounds concerned, \u201c I\u2019d suggest finding a new job. They have a bit of a reputation. \u201c\r\n\r\n\u201cLong enough. \u201c I\u2019m wary now, information is a resource I\u2019m not willing to part with easily. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong, mind you,  every day I spend with these wizards by another name, I like them less and less. Being sent with Kev, Jr, and the voices in my head, wandering across the country to find something called \u201cThe Fleshsmith\u201d, is the best case scenario in my opinion. Gives me some breathing room. \r\n\r\n\u201cHow do does one deal in shame? \u201c I say after a long silence. The glitched beeping of the machines becoming grating. \r\n\r\n\u201cNot as spooky as you\u2019d think. \r\n\r\nYou play airsoft?  I\u2019m Tori by the way. \u201c Tori says, lighting up a small black cigar. \r\n\r\n\u201cNever got the bug, but I\u2019ve heard of it, and I\u2019m Mike. \u201c I reply. \r\n\r\n\u201cWell Mike, I play, and it\u2019s a great hobby. Lots of physical activity, lots of equipment to learn about, it\u2019s got something for everyone.  For the most part, it\u2019s an exciting activity . \r\n\r\nBut, think of the factory that makes the plastic ammunition. It\u2019s integral, but it\u2019s cheap, easy to make, monotonous, and far removed from any of the interesting facets of the hobby. \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s me. I brush up against all kinds of folks, but besides the little wrinkle your friend is dealing with, all of the real spooky shit is well past arm\u2019s length. \u201c she coughs, the thick, cherry scented smoke hangs in rings, \u201c It\u2019s a living. \u201c\r\n\r\n\u201cHonestly, I couldn\u2019t be happier. \r\n\r\nI hear \u2018 Shame Monger\u2019 and I was thinking torture, and, I don\u2019t know, ghosts maybe? \u201c I shrug, motioning for one of the cigarellos. \r\n\r\nShe gives me one,  it tastes of rose and a rich, almost syrup like tobacco. \r\n\r\n\u201cSorry to disappoint. No, extraction is pretty painless, uses a kind of blotter paper. And to the best of my knowledge, ghosts aren\u2019t a thing. \r\n\r\nAs I said, things are safe and boring. \u201c Tori says, taking a seat on a black waist high stool. \r\n\r\nI let her statement hang for a moment. \r\n\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s with the big guy trying to blend in, waiting for me to leave the counter? And why did he come with 2 friends and a running engine? \u201c I say, low but casual. \r\n\r\nI can tell she\u2019s annoyed at my insight. \r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing horror adjacent. Just a good old fashioned shake down, cost of doing business. \r\n\r\nHe doesn\u2019t know exactly what goes on here, but him and his associates know it\u2019s profitable enough they can squeeze ten grand out of me a month. \u201c Tori shrugs, putting out her cigar. \r\n\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give someone a discount to rattle their cage? \u201c I ask, curious. \r\n\r\n\u201cListen to you. \u201c Tori laughs, \u201cIf your butcher asked you to  get shot for them, would you jump at the chance? \u201c\r\n\r\nI make eye contact, I can\u2019t help but smirk. \r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten shot for less. \u201c My comment gets a sideways look. \r\n\r\n\u201cMike, I\u2019m  seeing you, and I\u2019ve got to say, kinda seems like you\u2019re full of shit. \u201c Her reply is harsh, but I can\u2019t blame her. I\u2019m dressed like salesman, facial scars or no. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t reply. I walk to the grimy,  dim, wet floored men\u2019s room. \r\n\r\nSomeone who chooses my line of work doesn\u2019t get into it because they have great impulse control.  And unfortunately, I\u2019m not  unique . \r\n\r\nSince I\u2019ve got here, I\u2019ve felt scared, small, ineffective. I know you guys have seen Kevin\u2019s point of view on things, and it makes me seem like some kind of wrecking ball, but that is 50 per cent showmanship, 30 per cent planning and 20 per cent not caring if I lose a piece or two. \r\n\r\nBut this situation, some low rent semi-connected asshole who thinks he\u2019s Don Corleone? It calls to me. \r\n\r\nThe clothing I wear is designed to be reversable, and with a few adjustments, I\u2019m no longer wearing a cheap looking used car salesman\u2019s suit, but an antique tuxedo with a 1940s design. \r\n\r\nThe mirror is grimy as hell, I try to clear a spot, but the sad, octogenarian Esque flow from the tap isn\u2019t up to the task. \r\n\r\nBut it\u2019s clear enough to reflect him, standing behind me. I jump, and my heart starts to pound. \r\n\r\n\u201cNot the time for this. \u201c I say, pacing. \r\n\r\nI try to look away, but there he is, in the corner of my vision, each time. I\u2019d close my eyes, but that\u2019s what he wants, he gets closer when I can\u2019t see. \r\n\r\nFor a half second my vision is taken up by a crystal clear image of his face. That angular, pale visage inhuman by any standard, but haunting in it\u2019s echoes of a past rooted in mortality. \r\n\r\nI stumble backward, slamming into the wall. Panting, my eyes locked on his almost-there form. \r\n\r\nHe\u2019s tall,  wicked, and everything about him exudes power. He\u2019s taken to looking like me more and more lately. But a twisted, malignant reflection, what I could be if I let this pulp novel of a corner of reality have it\u2019s way with me. \r\n\r\n\u201cFuck off Demi! \u201c I say, getting to my feet, \u201c I\u2019ve got shit to do. \u201c \r\n\r\nStill don\u2019t know if he is just another hallucination, or who he says he is, but Demi and myself are on pretty poor terms as of late. \r\n\r\nI hear the bodyless old ghoul whispering what I assume are dark threats as I open a small tube of what I like to refer to as \u2018Mike\u2019s Mix\u2019. \r\n\r\nA combination of preparation H, topical anesthetic, and just a hint of clown white. Laugh if you want, but it stops a hell of a lot of incidental injuries in my line of work. \r\n\r\nDemi starts to fade and I see what I can of myself in the dull mirror. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m a little too old for the phrase, but I\u2019m sure a lot of you folks out there would refer to the clich\u00e9 spook I\u2019ve cultivated as \u201cCringe\u201d. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t disagree. \r\n\r\nBut, it\u2019s the game I have to play right now.  I\u2019m not some invincible cursed killer, but you know what, I can certainly play one on T.V. \r\n\r\n(Did I just try to relate to kids, then make a joke from a 40 year old commercial? This is why Kev does the writing.) \r\n\r\nI walk out of the bathroom, reeking of fear sweat and tainted water. The foot and a half lucite rod is tucked up my sleeve, I tap the end of it against the wall as I walk. \r\n\r\nThe guy is six feet, easily, he\u2019s fifty or so, but making up for it with trips to the gym and a few friendly doctors if I don\u2019t miss my guess.\r\n\r\nHe doesn\u2019t take the bait, just keeps talking to Tori, once he looks to me, I can tell he is asking her who I am, she\u2019s smart, she shrugs after looking over. \r\n\r\nI had an entire plan where I would embarrass the man, get him to send some guys, and make things so costly he just gave up on Tori. It\u2019s a classic, but if it ain\u2019t broke and all that. \r\n\r\nBut plans, like the people that make them, tend to fail at the worst times. \r\n\r\nOnce I get within striking distance, the guy turns, his speed isn\u2019t supernatural, but a lot more than I was expecting. His punch lands well enough that I don\u2019t remember starting to fall. \r\n\r\nThe second finishes the job before I can get my bearings. \r\n\r\nThe darkness creeps in and in it\u2019s peace I realize how stupid it was to go in this half cocked. I was jonesing for a fight I could win so badly, I went in without a plan B. \r\n\r\nI need someone to reign me in, back home it was Eli, here, it\u2019s Kev. As the last bits of conscious thought leave me, I feel bad about leaving him alone. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt's the stifling heat that wakes me up, before my vision clears I smell hot, cheap leather, old vomit and years worth of attempts to mask the smell. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m soaked in sweat, the air is like a sauna. I\u2019m sitting in the back of a car, I wouldn\u2019t call it a limo, but it\u2019s clearly built for comfort, in optimal circumstances. There\u2019s a tinted glass partition separating me from the front seat, it\u2019s cracked slightly, I try to tell if anyone is there, but have no luck. \r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t say this is a new experience. \u201c I say, to whoever may be listening. \r\n\r\nI try kicking out the windows and the partition, they don\u2019t budge a millimeter. \r\n\r\n\u201cIf you are up for talking things over, I\u2019m game. \u201c I try to pry the overhead light loose, and that\u2019s when I notice it. \r\n\r\nIt's a note, in a thick plastic sleeve, wrapped around my forearm and stuck with some kind of adhesive. \r\n\r\nThe pain is horrible, made all the worse by the constant pouring of sweat literally putting salt into the wound. \r\n\r\nSaid wound isn\u2019t deep, a few layers of skin down, enough to weep blood, but far away from pouring. But if this kills me, it won\u2019t be exsanguination. Depending on how long, whoever, plans on keeping me in here, I worry about infection, necrosis, pretty much all the members of the Untreated Wound crew. \r\n\r\nI take off the suit jacket, and tear it into strips to use as makeshift bandages, I have a feeling I\u2019ll be needing plenty by the time this is over. \r\n\r\nMy left arm is slow and clumsy as I open the envelope. I hope it\u2019s just shock, or swelling, not nerve damage. \r\n\r\nIt reads:\r\n\r\nHey, Dracula, or whatever the hell you are. \r\n\r\nFuck yourself, you think we don\u2019t have ways of taking care of your kind? \r\n\r\nHave Fun\r\n\r\nNiko Ferang\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, can\u2019t say the guy isn\u2019t succinct. \u201c I say, laughing. \r\n\r\nIf I just went up to the guy with a threat and a pipe, I\u2019d have either won or lost, and that\u2019d be the end of it. But my genius self succeeded in convincing him I was scary enough to toss me\u2026 here. \r\n\r\nIt dawns on me that there is something obvious I haven\u2019t tried. \r\n\r\nAs I pull the latch on the passenger side door, something inside me tells me to stop. \r\n\r\nVisually, I  can\u2019t really describe what it looked like opening the door. The brief period before I saw what was beyond was the visual equivalent of trying to catch a greased pig. \r\n\r\nI was left with a view, an identical car interior. The other car parked  impossibly close, Their doors seeming to blend with their exteriors. \r\n\r\nI enter, as a great man once said \u201cBuy the ticket, take the ride. \u201c, and my dumb ass need for assurance, bought me one hell of a ride. \r\n\r\nOnce I get in, the driver\u2019s side door closes, and I find myself in the same sweltering heat, in the same backseat. \r\n\r\nThe damp leather sticks to my arms, I start to calculate how much water I\u2019m losing by the minute, and the math scares the hell out of me. \r\n\r\nI try going through the door a few more times, but the more I do, the more I realize, it\u2019s the same car. \r\n\r\nThe fear becomes as oppressive as the wet heat, I\u2019ve researched a hell of a lot of things from the watchers library, but infinite Oldsmobiles didn\u2019t come up. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been disarmed, but left with my phone, and wallet. I\u2019m kind of impressed they managed to find 99 per cent of the equipment I can hide in a suit, but hey, %1 is  better than nothing. \r\n\r\nThe phone makes a useless bludgeon, I quickly retire the idea, and figure, even neutered as it is ( I find I can get online, but little else.), it\u2019s better doing phone things than broken. \r\n\r\nThe good news is frighteningly slim. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve got a few feet of polymar tarp, folded in the wallet, useful for a lot of things, but most important in my situation will be trying to get some kind of drinking water. \r\n\r\nAn emergency credit card knife, barely useful little thing, won\u2019t do me any good in a fight, but might be a useful tool. \r\n\r\nThree strike anywhere matches, a small hook and length of fishing line. \r\n\r\nMy lips are cracked and bleeding, it can\u2019t have been more than an hour or two, but I\u2019m starting to feel heat exhaustion set in. \r\n\r\nI think I\u2019ve found something when the knife sinks into the thin leather of the overstuffed backseat, but the shoddy blade encounters some kind of solid matter, and as I pull the knife out, the leather seals itself. \r\n\r\nI stay still, trying to conserve energy, trying to formulate some plan. \r\n\r\nHe sits beside me now, his looming hunched frame bent in the confines of the car. His face is a blur, but I know beneath the shadows he's smirking. \r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m way too tired for you Demi. \u201c I say, wiping what feels like a liter of sweat from my forehead. \r\n\r\nHis repeating, echoing laughter proves me wrong, I shiver, despite the brutal heat. \r\n\r\nIt can\u2019t have been more than a few degrees, bit It feels like getting splashed with ice water. \r\n\r\nThe light in the car begins to dim, and with it, the soul crushing temperature of the luxury automobile drops. \r\n\r\nI scramble to set up the tarp, I was banking on this, without some kind of temperature drop, the plastic sheet is useless. \r\n\r\nWithin an hour droplets have began to create a small stream, collecting at the cone shaped tip of the suspended tarp. Lacking anything to put it into, I catch the liquid in my mouth. \r\n\r\nIt's foul, and likely contaminated, but it\u2019s my only option. If I\u2019m stuck in here a week I can get by without food, brutalized by heat, I won\u2019t make it 2 days without water. \r\n\r\nI feel exhausted, wondering exactly how long I\u2019ve been stuck here I check the time on my phone. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s almost random progression does nothing to comfort the surreal sense of dread that is enveloping me. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know when I passed out, but I wake up laying across the reeking leather, being dragged backward. \r\n\r\nI feel fingers, dozens of them, clawing, scraping, trying to gain purchase. A crevice begins to open in the deep black leather, and I begin to be dragged into it. \r\n\r\nI throw myself forward, landing painfully on the sticky, grime ridden floor of the car. \r\n\r\nFear, and the awkward ergonomics of my situation make turning around a slow, nerve wracking chore. Once I manage to, I regret the decision. \r\n\r\nHands, some small, some large, some seemingly cobbled together from mismatched scraps, slowly pull themselves from the crevice between the seat and back of the back seat. \r\n\r\nThey prod and crawl like insects, none ever giving way to arm, just a lumpen flow of calloused, wrist like structure, giving each an segmented, centipede like appearance. \r\n\r\nI sit up, watching the macabre display, trying to make some kind of sense of it. \r\n\r\nI actually scream when there\u2019s a sharp, loud, mechanical ringing beside my head. The type of analogue noise that went out of style long before land lines did. \r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t take me long to find the handle and pull out an ancient car phone, it\u2019s a two part wood paneled brick of a thing, I pick up the receiver, \u201cHello\u201d I say, a question as much as a greeting. \r\n\r\nThe voice is male, probably early twenties. \r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about them. They can be an issue if you don\u2019t sleep on the floor, but I\u2019ve never seen one drag itself more than half way across the seat. \u201c He\u2019s calm, but has a survivors hushed impatience. \r\n\r\n\u201cWho are you? \u201c I ask. \r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t lie to you man. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been in here a while, but now that there is someone else, I think I can get  out. Call me Pol. \u201c I catch the hopeful tone in his voice. \r\n\r\n\u201cHow? \u201c I say simply, still trying in vain to put more space between me and the hands. \r\n\r\n\u201cNot to sound cold, but if I tell you, there is a chance you just take the information and leave me here. \r\n\r\nThe first step is us meeting, you\u2019ll know the plan by the time that happens. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t lie. \u201c If nothing else I can say Pol seems smart. \r\n\r\n\u201cFair enough, what can I do? \u201c I Trail off at the end of my sentence, one of the hands is pointing at me. \r\n\r\n\u201cYou need to understand a few things about this place. \r\n\r\nFirst, don\u2019t travel at night. Nothing you are going to find is going to be any better than the crawlers. \r\n\r\nSecond, remember the numbers, 1, 5 and 9. I\u2019m assuming you have a watch, or a cellular phone? If the time ends in one of those, you\u2019re likely to find a new space. \r\n\r\nLast,  what\u2019s outside of the car, on the driver\u2019s side, pretend it doesn\u2019t exist. \u201c The instructions are cryptic, but I\u2019m in no place to turn down good advice. \r\n\r\n\u201cHow do I know I can trust you? \u201c I ask, knowing the answer. \r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t see how I could be anything other than what I say. \r\n\r\nWouldn\u2019t it be pretty obvious if I was trying to lead you astray?  \u201c Pol\u2019s response is reasonable, but a lifetime of being blindsided makes me wary. \r\n\r\n\u201cI guess so. What should I be doing now? \u201c I say, flipping off the hand like thing that continues to point at me. \r\n\r\n\u201cGet some sleep. Time, day and night cycles, they mean nothing here, and passing out in a hundred and fifty degree weather is a shitty way to go. \r\n\r\nI won\u2019t be able to get through during the day, so listen carefully. \r\n\r\nIf you time your travel right, you are going to be looking for two main things. The first is going to be a pillow mint, eventually you are going to starve either way, the human body needs more than just sugar, but you should be able to find enough to keep you going till malnutrition kicks in. The second is a soda can, it\u2019s a sip, and it\u2019s turned, but it\u2019s better than trying to lick the droplets from the windows. \u201c I listen to Pol, hopefully memorizing his instructions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaylight brings with it reek and heat, I watch the hands scuttle back to within the recesses of the seats, shuddering a bit as I see wave like, movements in the cushions. \r\n\r\n\u201cGod damn it. \u201c I say looking at the display on my knock off phone. About %50, for all I know I\u2019ll be out in 15 minutes, but I\u2019m not banking on it. \r\n\r\nI watch the numbers flash by like a stock ticker, waiting to see if Pol is trying to screw me over or not. \r\n\r\nI see 1:39 and crack open the passenger side door. \r\n\r\nThe same sweltering heat, the same basic backseat, but I know, at a glance, things are not quite identical. Part repetition from the day before, part a decade and a half playing private eye, but I can tell Pol was telling the truth. \r\n\r\nLipstick, smeared on the passenger window, an old handprint. It seems like something bad happened here. \r\n\r\nThe leather of one of the headrests is torn, I purposely avoid looking at the certainly not stuffing inside. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s like this place wants to tell a story, I can\u2019t help but try and hear it. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t find any soda, but I do find a single, red and white pillow mint, wrapper mostly in tact, sitting in a sticky patch on the floor. \r\n\r\nI try my luck a few more times, using the cell phone as a kind of metronome, and while I do get a lot of repetition, every so often, there is a little change, or quirk. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve collected two pocketfulls of mints, and found myself desperately hoping to stumble upon anything to drink. Another night of distilled sweat, dust, and God knows what doesn\u2019t seem appealing. \r\n\r\nI must have been too slow opening the door, I\u2019d done it over two hundred times at this point, and the grey haze of this new variation set off every danger instinct in me. \r\n\r\nIt felt like I was being watched from every angle, despite the gloom the heat was worse, and seemed to bake a fungal reek into the air itself. \r\n\r\nThe door handle on the passenger side is mangled, the steel colored plastic twisted into a useless lump.  \r\n\r\nThe leather seems slightly rotten, weather stripping peels, light fixtures are cracked and loose, it feels very, old. \r\n\r\nI watch the phone, my eyes instinctively darting around, there are noises from the front seat and I doubt they have my best interests in mind. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m trying the mangled door handle but something is broken. \r\n\r\nThat being, said, with a car this old, the fish hook, with enough persistence could work, \r\n\r\nI Peel back some of the stripping around the window, te hook begins it\u2019s slow trek down into the mechanics of the door. \r\n\r\nI scratch my wounded arm, it hurts, but that isn\u2019t what concerns me. I feel a small, irregular lump. \r\n\r\nI peel back my makeshift bandages, and what I see attempts me make to vomit stomach contents that weren\u2019t there. \r\n\r\nSmall, brown grey mushrooms, a half dozen, about the size of a grain of rice. I feel a tingling in the wound, and panic sets in. \r\n\r\nOpening  a door like this requires a steady hand, but between the noises in the front seat, and the literally budding body horror on my arm, my nerves are shot. \r\n\r\nI hear the partition begin to lower, and that rotten, fungal reek becomes nearly a physical force. My eyes water, my nose runs, and I hear a noise, like flowing sand. \r\n\r\nI feel the hook dig under the proper part of the lock and pull up as I feel something wet soak through my shoe. \r\n\r\nThe door opens violently, not that I\u2019m upset, I toss myself forward like I\u2019m going for a touchdown, my forehead slams off of the armrest in the newest backseat I find myself in. \r\n\r\nBefore the passenger side closes I catch a glimpse of the mess that spilled from behind the partition.  Rot and flesh, an aborted rotten attempt at life enraged at the universe that spawned it. \r\n\r\nI actually feel relief at the blinding sunlight, and shining leather, and find myself relating to the monsterous mass I left behind. \r\n\r\nI look at my arm, realizing I didn\u2019t leave all of it behind. \r\n\r\n\u201cOh, fuck me. \u201c I say, fumbling the credit card knife together. \r\n\r\nThe mushrooms had doubled in size, the cheap tin knife makes a terrible scalpel, I scream as I err on the side of caution, flaying a half inch around each. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m bleeding heavily, half of the makeshift bandages barely keeping the flow at bay. \r\n\r\nMy vision swims, I feel sick, and I fight the urge to break down into a mentally and physically broken heap. \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s where I\u2019ll leave everyone. Night is falling, and without a little more help from Pol, I don\u2019t know how much longer I\u2019m going to last. \r\n\r\nIf this is the last time you hear from me, well I\u2019m sure Kev will have you guys covered for the rest of what I hope is Art\u2019s downfall. \r\n\r\nIf it isn\u2019t, I\u2019ve got a favor to ask, did you guys notice anything I didn\u2019t? Is there anything that is more obvious from outside this displaced cluster fuck?",

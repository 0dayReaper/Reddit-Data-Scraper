    "postText": "lt was in a little ziplock bag, somehow completely dry but it was dead. i went back home and plugged it in, for 2 weeks it stayed in the charger. \n\n\u201cit\u2019s broken\u201d said everyone who saw it. but i didn\u2019t give up on it. after those two weeks it lit up with the familiar apple logo before displaying the home screen. \n\nthe phone\u2019s home screen was a photo of a little girl that looked to be 5-7 years old, cute as a button, playing with a dog. i was surprised when i tried to open it that it had no password. the only app visible on the home screen was the notes app. \n\ni spent about half an hour debating on whether i should open it or not. they clearly wanted me to see whatever is inside the notes app or else they wouldn\u2019t have hidden everything else, right?\n\ni caved, and opened the app. it was a log of some sorts, like a diary. i began to read. i don\u2019t know how to explain what i read or even where to talk about it so i\u2019m gonna copy it and paste it here. i\u2019m sorry for disrespecting the owner of this phone\u2019s privacy. i don\u2019t know where else i can show it so i\u2019m gonna show it here, on reddit.\n\nhere\u2019s what it said:\n\n\nkaylee has been jumping up and down since i told her we were going to italy. i had to give her my laptop to watch youtube and work on my phone instead because she wouldn\u2019t shut up about all the things we plan to do.\n\ni won\u2019t take her to any of the historical landmarks, a 6 year old wouldn\u2019t care about those. we\u2019re only staying for 4 days. the first day we\u2019re going horse riding by the beach, the next day eating at 10 different restaurants and seing which is best, and in the last day i\u2019m taking her on a boat in venice.\n\nthis is the same exact trip i took with my wife 8 years ago. the same trip i proposed to her on. i wanted to take kaylee here so she could know how it all began, exactly.\n\nwe\u2019ve been having so much fun over the last 2 days i haven\u2019t had any time to type in here. were about to get on the boat now.\n\ni just told kaylee what happened on a boat just like this one, she was super exited. she couldn\u2019t believe she was on the same trip me and her mother took to get married. i proposed to her on a boat like this.\n\nshe was jumping up and down like she always does when she\u2019s exited. but something strange happened. the guy who\u2019s rowing the boat turned his head and frowned at her. but there was something alarmingly wrong about his face, his expression, the way his neck was twisted.\n\ni apologized and he continued to row. i told kaylee to try not to move a lot as the boat is not that big. she agreed and leaned on one side, watching the buildings around her. they were all kinds of colors and sizes, she waved at everyone and most of them waved back. it\u2019s adorable.\n\ni laid my head back a bit and somehow fell asleep, this was very strange as i\u2019m prone to seasickness. what was stranger is where the boat was. it was no longer in a river with colorful buildings on each side, rather on a big ocean.\n\ni was kind of thrown back by this and asked kaylee where we were and to my surprise she was also asleep. i looked up at the sky, it was nighttime. last i recall it was sunset. have i really slept for that long? why hasn\u2019t the boat driver woken me up? \n\ni went up to him and tapped him on the shoulder, this time he let go of the oars and they fell into the now ocean and sunk. aren\u2019t boat ores supposed to float? he looked at me with that now familiar frown, his eyes only a few inches away from mine. i fell back and he got new ores and continued rowing. i have no idea where he got them from, the boat is not big enough to carry oars of that size, and even if it was, i have not seen any spares on the boat.\n\nwhen i fell back, i got a good look of the sky. it was completely blank. no moon, no clouds, no stars. you\u2019d think that was normal due to pollution, but how is their pollution in the middle of the ocean? \n\nkaylee woke up around here, she began to panic. i immediately hugged her and shushed her, as to not anger the driver anymore. she asked at least 20 questions which were all met with an \u201ci don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\ni\u2019m as terrified as she is, if not more. the situation i\u2019m in is already bad enough, but i have a 6 year old with me who i have to ensure always stays calm. we hugged and i told her in an unsure tone \u201cwe\u2019re gonna be okay baby doll. it\u2019s okay\u201d \n\nafter i said that the driver flung his oar back and two giant fish landed on the boat. they smelled weird, almost like they were cooked, seasoned even. i took a good sniff before biting one. it tasted amazing. probably the first good thing that happened to us. \n\ni ate one first and waited a bit to make sure it wasn\u2019t poisoned before allowing kaylee to eat. i\u2019ve been trying my hardest to act calm for her. if i panic then she panics then we all go down.\n\ni began to sing her lullabies to calm her down. though there was a million things going on in my mind. how would i drink? how would i eat? where the hell am i? how did i sleep in a goddamn boat? why am i not getting seasick?\n\ni was panicking inside my mind, though i wouldn\u2019t let kaylee know about it. this is already a difficult enough situation without a panicked 6 year old\n\nit just turned from night to day in a second, i didn\u2019t have any time to react. again, there is no sun or clouds to be visible. the water was still a very dark blue, it feels like it goes down hundreds if not thousands of kilometers. it feels like the void from subnautica but without the leviathans, thankfully. \n\ni don\u2019t know how, but kaylee woke up and she wasn\u2019t panicked. another 2 fish were pushed by the oar, this time i let kaylee eat with me. \u201cwe need water\u201d i thought. the moment i thought that it began to rain. but we were not getting wet. it was raining but the rain wasn\u2019t actually falling, neither on the boat nor on the water. \n\ni decided to take a sip of the water. i have no idea why but it just seemed like something i had to do. it was fresh water. tasted very clean too. i once again waited for any side effects before letting kaylee drink.\n\nit\u2019s been one week of us being stranded on this boat. i think the worst thing about it is that we have an excuse to live. we have consistent food and practically infinite water.  but there is absolutely nothing stopping us from losing our minds. suicide is not an option, i have a 6 year old daughter with me. though i have contemplated killing us both as a way out of here.\n\nafter 2 more weeks of this nonsense, i decided to take action. i broke off a piece of wood, sharp enough to kill if i had to, and went up to the driver who was rowing this boat for 3 weeks straight.\n\nhe looked at me, his eyes widened and his dark skin darkened. he then stood up, looking down at me, before jumping off the boat.\n\ni heard a very very disturbing noise that i can\u2019t quite describe with words before blood came to the surface. the blood darkened and it turned into a dark brown, the same color of his skin. this isn\u2019t blood, i muttered. for a moment i had forgotten that i have a 6 year old with me. she wasn\u2019t crying but the expression on her face made me want to cry.\n\nit was fear. that\u2019s all i can say about what was on my daughter\u2019s face. fear.\n\nthe daily cooked and seasoned fish stopped coming in, and i can tell the water below us is draining, quickly. i don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, so i\u2019m gonna throw my phone into the water. to whoever finds this, if anyone, please go to a toy store and buy a dinosaur stuffed animal, and throw it into the ocean. it\u2019s my daughter\u2019s favorite animal and it would comfort her knowing that her stuffed dinosoar is coming to rescue us.\n\nhorrified by what i had just read, i did as instructed. i bought a stuffed dinosaur and threw it into the ocean. it moved away very fast, and got sunk into the ocean.\n\ni sat down, just thinking, processing, when i remembered my brother took my niece on a boat in venice.\n\ni rushed to text him but my messages were not sent. the last trace of him was an instagram story. it was a selfie of him and his daughter on the boat, in the backround was a dark skinned driver, with a odd twisted neck and a frown i can\u2019t get behind.",

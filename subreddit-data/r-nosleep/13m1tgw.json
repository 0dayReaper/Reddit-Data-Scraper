    "postText": "A few years ago, I wrote a book about Peter Nash called *The Man in the Closet.* Unfortunately, due to an  lawsuit from his victims\u2019 families, the publisher ultimately pulled the book from store shelves and removed the digital version from Amazon. \n\nGiven what I found out today, I feel like it\u2019s in the community\u2019s best interests for my interviews with the killer to be shared as widely as possible. \n\nFor your own safety, please read the following excerpt. \n\n\\*\n\n*Jan 15, 2017:* \n\n*Interviewer: I\u2019d like to go back to something you mentioned during one of our first sessions. About your childhood. You said you hiding became an addiction. Your word. Can you talk a bit more about that?*\n\n*Nash: When my dad got to drinking or getting high, he loved hitting on me and my siblings. And then like I said, there came a day where he beat my mother half to death. And even after that, she insisted on going on like nothing was wrong, like we were a normal family. But if I was out there in the living room, watching TV or reading or whatever, it was always with the knowledge that it all might break at any moment. That he\u2019d run in and start tossing furniture and throwing punches. At some point, I couldn\u2019t relax anywhere but in a dark closet. At least there, I had some chance he wouldn\u2019t find me. That I\u2019d be safe.*\n\n*Interviewer: Until one day\u2026*\n\n*Nash: Until one day, I wasn\u2019t safe. He came home like usual, except my mom had taken my sisters out for ice cream in town. But my dad, he just kept tearing the place apart, looking for someone. Me, I guess. And then finally he found me. But this time, I wasn\u2019t going to get hit again.*\n\n*Interviewer: You\u2019d taken the hunting knife into the closet with you.*\n\n*Nash: I hadn\u2019t planned to use it. Not really. I just knew I felt safer holding it.* \n\n*Interviewer: But you did use it.*\n\n*Nash: Oh yes I did. That first time was improvisation, of course. But it felt absolutely right. Right away. I\u2019ll always treasure the look on my father\u2019s face. It was just perfect. My best work, really. I think every one after that was a pale imitation, unfortunately. Of course, they were all special in their way, but that first one\u2026*\n\n*Interviewer: You didn\u2019t kill again for a long time after that.*\n\n*Nash: No. I wanted to, but I also was trying to resist it. I hid though. Lots of hiding.*\n\n*Interviewer: In your same closet?*\n\n*Nash: No, lots of closets around town. It became kind of a game to me. I\u2019d watch people coming and going from a house, learning their patterns. Eventually, when I was sure no one was home, I\u2019d go inside and find a nice closet. Something not too big. There was a certain pleasure in contorting myself to get into a small space. It was part of the game I guess.*\n\n*Interviewer: And then what?*\n\n*Nash: And then I\u2019d just listen. Sometimes I\u2019d stay a few hours, sometimes much longer. I\u2019d let the family come home and just listen to their conversations. I\u2019d always try to pick the nicest looking families. Maybe I was hoping it was a facade, that they\u2019d come home and scream bloody murder at each other. Some did, of course. But a lot of them were just as nice at home as they were out in the street.*\n\n*Interviewer: And that made you feel\u2026*\n\n*Nash: You sound like my psychiatrist.*\n\n*Interviewer: Sorry. I\u2019m just trying to understand your motivation at this stage.*\n\n*Nash: I was jealous I suppose. Resentful. But I was still young. My feelings hadn\u2019t hardened into anything real, yes. I was just an observer.*\n\n*Interviewer: Were you ever caught?*\n\n*Nash: Once or twice. I was a fast runner, and I\u2019d go to neighborhoods pretty far from my own. Nothing ever came of it.*\n\n*Interviewer: At what point did that escalate into\u2026 more?*\n\n*Nash: I suppose at some point, sitting in those dark closets I started making rules. This probably goes back to when I was a kid, fantasizing about leaping out of that closet and fighting my dad. But\u2026 it became like. Okay. There are rules to this. As long as this family is all nice to each other, I\u2019ll let them live. Or as long as they don\u2019t open the closet, I won\u2019t stab them with my knife. Or if they somehow figured our I was there and tried to run away, that was no good. Then when the families violated those rules, it felt okay to kill them. They weren't nice families anymore.*\n\n*Interviewer: How many times did this scenario play out?*\n\n*Nash: Oh, at least fifty. I\u2019d say about half the time, the family really did turn out to be nice, and no one opened the closet. Then, after they\u2019d gone to bed at night, I\u2019d just let myself out the front door. Other times, people starting yelling at each other, and I\u2019d have to come out to teach them a lesson.*\n\n*Interviewer: And if they opened the closet door?*\n\n*Nash: It\u2019s not nice to go looking for someone who doesn\u2019t want to be found. I had to teach them a lesson too.*\n\n\\*\n\nIn their lawsuit, the victims\u2019 families argued I\u2019d done too good a job of humanizing Nash. They were worried he\u2019d be able to appeal for a lighter sentence or a less secure prison facility. To me, the accusations were ridiculous. I\u2019d basically just printed our interviews verbatim without any editorial intrusion. \n\nOf course, maybe you could argue that I was throwing out softball questions. To that, I\u2019d say that I needed to build up trust with Nash. He didn\u2019t like to be put on the spot or questioned too harshly. To get the truth, I had to be his friend.\n\nI will say I\u2019ve come to regret getting too chummy with him toward the end. It got to a point where he started asking questions about my wife and kids. Maybe I\u2019d been lulled into thinking he was harmless, or maybe I\u2019m just a proud dad, but I couldn\u2019t help gushing about them: Elliot\u2019s awesome passing on the soccer field, and the way Greta meticulously organized her dolls\u2019 clothing even though she was only six. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about those conversations a lot today.\n\nToday, we were just sitting down with the kids to play Settlers of Catan when I got a call from Todd Wells over at the state prison. Normally, I ignored all distractions during family game day, but this was no ordinary call. \n\nI hadn\u2019t heard from Wells since a few weeks after my book on the Man in the Closet had come out, and that conversation had been unpleasant to say the least.\n\n\u201cMr. Wells, so nice to hear\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making this call as a courtesy. We\u2019re holding a press conference in thirty minutes. There was an incident during Mr. Nash\u2019s prisoner transfer to the new state facility in Belmont last night. There was a bad traffic accident and an explosion. We thought we\u2019d accounted for all of the detainees, dead and alive, but you know Mr. Nash. He\u2019s good at hiding.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cWe still haven\u2019t located him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want to find out more, watch the press conference. I made this call as a courtesy. God bless and good luck.\u201d\n\nHe hung up, and I began to look around the room. All of the closet doors were closed. We\u2019re a fairly messy household, and a lot of doors usually get left open. Was it possible that we\u2019d closed them all? I tried to remember if I\u2019d shut them as part of my usual tidying last night.\n\nThen I thought over the events of the morning. We\u2019d all gone out to a big breakfast at the Black Bear diner and then hit the mall to get new tap shoes for Greta and shinguards for Elliot. We\u2019d been gone for hours.\n\nI looked over at my wife, who was walking over to the dining room table with a big bowl of popcorn. In the meantime, Greta was carefully arranging the game tiles into stacks, and Elliot was setting up a playlist on his phone.\n\nAs Greta reached the table with the popcorn, Greta groaned.\n\n\u201cDid you put pepper on it?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said my wife. \u201cWe all like it that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI used to like it that way,\u201d said Greta, crossing her arms. \u201cNow I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAs they began to argue, I kept looking around the house, trying to listen for any hint of a sound from the closets. Nothing so far. I noticed my hands shaking a bit in a way I couldn\u2019t control.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d I said, joining everyone at the table. \u201cLet\u2019s try not to argue right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Greta, crossing her arms. \u201cSince when did we make it through family game day without fighting? You and mom are the worst, you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d I lied, trying not to imagine the sound of a closet door creaking open. \u201cYou watch and see. This is going to be the best family game day ever! Let\u2019s all make it a big goal to get along, okay?\u201d\n\nGreta rolled her eyes and went back to arranging the tiles.\n\nPart of me thought about running. But you\u2019re not supposed to run. Maybe I could have pretended I had something to show them out in the front yard. I don\u2019t know. Maybe that would have been too obvious a lie.\n\nAnd so a few minutes later, we started the game. \n\nI have to admit, I\u2019ve been a bit distracted this whole time. When I get anxious, writing calms me down. As the game has progressed, I\u2019ve been alternating between defusing little arguments and tapping away at my keyboard. I told them something important for work has come up, which it has, but I think they don't appreciate how distracted I've been. \n\nMaybe, if you find this, and we\u2019re not around anymore, you\u2019ll at least know what became of us. Maybe you can finally put my book out again and attach this as a kind of epilogue. \n\nBut my hope is that you\u2019re reading this, and I\u2019m still doing fine. Maybe every closet in the house is empty. Or even better, maybe we\u2019ll play the whole game without arguing about someone hoarding one of the resources, or \u2018cheating\u2019 to build the longest road, or blocking someone from winning out of spite. \n\n[Because we really are a nice family.](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)",

All of your clothes will be ruined, but at least you might catch the murderman if he's in your house. He is not a supernatural entity or something, just some dude with a knife. Shouldn't be too hard to apprehend if you are prepared and armed. If he is not in your house yet, take off all the closet doors.

    "postText": "Dr. Gilmore was a very odd client. He always acted as if people were after him, a shadowy, unknowable \u201cthey\u201d. And for an odd, inexplicable reason he was obsessed with the collection of religious artifacts.\n\nRecently, he\u2019d sent us on a wild goose chase for the bones of a saint. A saint that also happened to be a Serpenthead. He was that sort of weird.\n\nStill, he paid well, and even if he canceled at the last minute- the artifacts he wanted us to procure fetched a high price elsewhere.\n\nI was not surprised when he ended up dead.\n\nIn an alley. Torn to shreds, mauled by wild dogs, and dressed in religious robes we\u2019d sold to him for a few thousand dollars. His death did not concern me.\n\nBut the museum chock-full of expensive, dangerous artifacts he left behind greatly did.\n\nMy name is Quentin Lorreno. I\u2019m somewhat of a middleman in the criminal underworld. I mediate the crime families, I arrange diplomatic marriages, I keep things civil.\n\nBut above all I host auctions. Art is a tastefully wonderful medium of laundering money, and hosting both underworld- and legal auctions is kind of my speciality.\n\nAnd I also recover and sell cursed artifacts.\n\nMy plan was in essence, to raid Dr. Gilmore\u2019s Museum. All the artifacts we\u2019d sold, back in our hands. And all the money we\u2019d earned selling them to Gilmore- we could sell to a million other collectors.\n\nGilmore was the type not to have any security, fearing the ever elusive \u2018THEY\u2019 would infiltrate the office, so it wouldn\u2019t be a complex heist. And my team was built for it.\n\nSteven, my assistant and magician could dispel any enchanted security forces. My psychic, Aster, could sense what artifacts had the most value. And Matt had a history of hunting and killing monsters.\n\nAnd I had both the files and the wit to keep us together.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d my assistant, Steven began, rubbing his thick, white haired head, \u201cif we raid Gilmore\u2019s the Company is going to be after us.\u201d\n\nAh. I hadn\u2019t factored in the Company.\n\nWe engaged in the criminal art of passing and selling illegal, cursed artifacts. The Company was the polar opposite; their world-government funded agency recovered artifacts and locked them in warehouses across the globe.\n\nAnd if they thought the operations of the House of Lorreno had gotten out of hand- they wouldn\u2019t think twice about crushing us.\n\nOne would wonder why the Company hadn\u2019t already crushed us. We were in the business of recovering dangerous artifacts for equally deadly clients.\n\nWe had a deal, me and them. Well, one or two of them. I would squeal on the ones that seemed too unhinged, the ones looking with the intent of hurting others.\n\n They would get names, addresses, locations- and we were left well enough alone.It was an unspoken rule. A tacit code of the artifact underworld. \n\nOne did not mess with the Company, and they did not mess with you.\u201cCorrection!\u201d I pointed out. \u201cThey might be after us!\u201d I reminded the team of the deal we had made. \u201cThink of it: we sold over three hundred artifacts to Gilmore. If we resell those- our debt to the Stetski Crime Families may be repaid.\u201d\n\nMatt rolled his eyes. \u201cHow exactly are we going to recover three hundred artifacts from the middle of nowhere before the Company get there first?\u201d\n\nAster raised a hand. \u201cWe have the eternal backpack of Ali Roschenka.\u201d This was a relatively new item in our collection. But, as the name suggested, allowed us to store virtually an infinite amount of anything within it.\n\n\u201cMe and Steven haven\u2019t finished emptying it,\u201d Matt countered. \u201cWe\u2019re quite certain there\u2019s a guy trapped in there.\u201d\n\nSteven nodded along, agreeing. \u201cWe\u2019re quite certain it\u2019s Ali himself.\u201d \n\nThis was new information. \u201cSomehow, he survived.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheoretically, it will work, right?\u201d I inquired, discussing the backpack. \u201cThe protective spells on everything we sold him should keep us safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell yes,\u201d Steven affirmed. \u201cNothing we sold him was above a class three. Most of them were dormant, too, or augmentation tools.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what are we waiting for?\u201d I discussed. \u201cEmpty the backpack and let\u2019s hit the road!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if the Company decides to confront us about it?\u201d Aster finalized.\n\nI thought about it for a moment. And then another. \u201cWe leave no evidence we were there. And if they do find out,\u201d I paused and thought about it, \u201cwe\u2019ll hand the artifacts over to them.\u201d\n\nAster and the team mulled over that for a second more, and found it acceptable. I answered some unrelated questions regarding another client, and we dismissed.\n\nMatt and Steven went back to removing the rest of the backpack\u2019s contents. I checked on them now and then, finding the room filled with bits and bobs. Ancient scrolls, pearled jewelry- even a cat.\n\nAnd of course, Ali Roschenka himself. We locked him into one of our many storage rooms with food, a blanket, and water.\n\nThis would be temporary. We would deal with him later.\n\nI checked in on the psychic, next. \u201cAster,\u201d I found them reaching into the ether, surrounded by a selection of docile, but powerful artifacts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honing my skills,\u201d she explained. She picked up an old, dusty book from the floor. \u201cI found this in the room we found in the basement.\u201d\n\nI read it- Everett\u2019s guide to successful Canaries. \u201cEverett was my father\u2019s Canary- psychic.\u201d I murmured. \u201cWhat\u2019s in this book?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore advanced skills,\u201d Aster shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve only just started.\u201d\n\n\u201cCheck back with you later.\u201d I journeyed off into another selection of rooms. I checked my schedules, dotted the i\u2019s and crossed the t\u2019s of new imports for the auction house.\n\nRestless, that was it. I wanted to be in the museum and recovering our artifacts. Our debts to a very relentless and terrifying crime family would soon- hopefully, be paid off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201d Matt cheered, tossing over the old tattered backpack. \u201cNo more things inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re mostly sure of that,\u201d Steven added. \u201cThere might be a cat in there still.\u201d I looked inside. I only saw an open void of nothing.\n\nI decided it was good enough. I told them to get prepared while I fetched Aster.\n\nWithin the next few moments we were ready. Gilmore, much to our luck, lived an hour\u2019s drive away, so we wouldn\u2019t arrive too late. Earlier was best, especially when the threat of Company 7 was on our coattails.\n\nWe were geared up to the max.\n\nGilmore was paranoid. He didn\u2019t have living guards, but from the two times we\u2019d actually delivered something to his museum he did have undead guards. And the news of his death had rocked the criminal underworld.\n\nOther looters were bound to be on their way. \u201cSo,\u201d Matt began, a smile on his face, the kind he often had when he was about to tell a joke, \u201cif you die and come back, you\u2019re undead.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d Aster said.\n\nHe laughed to himself. \u201cSo if you kill an undead, aren\u2019t you re-dead?\u201d\n\nAster shook her head and replied, \u201cNo, I think that\u2019s just dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then you\u2019re dead twice- ooh, what if they resurrect you again- does that make you-\u201d he paused, thinking intently, goofy grin on his face, \u201cunre-dead. No, that\u2019s not right, un-undead.\u201d\n\n\u201cRe-undead?\u201d I managed, joining in.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll all be dead if you don\u2019t shut up,\u201d Steven silenced, stopping the car behind a patch of green. We were deep in the countryside now, near the large, expansive mansion Gilmore had called his museum.\n\nAster reached into the ether, leaning forward, eyes growing brighter. She focused, tensing and as I steadied her, I noted how cold she was. \u201cHe still has most of our stuff.\u201d She searched deeper. \u201cAbout a dozen undead- Rawheads, Paleskins, Nazkaerti, a Kingbeast- more.\u201d\n\nI remembered seeing a small menagerie of creatures inside. \u201cCan you tell if he still has that Chimera?\u201d Aster nodded. We were ready. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nRifle in one hand, knife in the other I lead the group across the brush, climbing over the small fence, careful not to make any noises.\n\nThe sun shone brightly above us. I remembered we were in broad daylight, and we would look equal parts stupid and concerning if anyone saw us. But then again, Gilmore was so paranoid the place was in the middle of nowhere.\n\nWe found ourselves at the entrance.\n\nI checked the handle. \u201cIt\u2019s locked.\u201d The team looked at me in annoyance. \u201cWell I don\u2019t want to break the door.\u201d\n\nSteven muttered something and the locks clickled, and the door slipped open. \u201cWoah.\u201d Steven\u2019s awe was correct.\n\n\u201cIs it me,\u201d Matt began, \u201cor is the inside bigger than the outside?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do believe so,\u201d Aster agreed. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t catch that.\u201d\n\nIn from of us was a ballroom, twin doors only revealing a sliver. To the right wing of the house were acres of shelves and ancient books. To the left was a more open area, with signs placed in front of objects and unfathomable things in cages.\n\nSteven headed right, inspecting a book. \u201cDear god! It\u2019s the Tome of Kubash Ciseth!\u201d We stared at him. Only he was familiar with the book. \u201cYou must have heard of Kubash Ciseth?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we supposed to?\u201d Aster puzzled. I shook my head.\n\nWe went on, heading left while Steven oohed and aahed at the spellbooks, taking the ones he found interesting to his little book bag. He would join us later; Steven could handle himself.\n\nAs for us, we followed Aster\u2019s commands; she sensed which looked and felt expensive, and I dumped them into the eternal bag, in with protective container and all.\n\nMatt, for his part, kept watch. He was on guard, which also meant he started to crack really unfunny jokes.\n\n\u201cHey guys, why did the vampire refuse to drink tomato soup?\u201d he answered himself, despite neither of us reacting. \u201cBecause he didn\u2019t like imitation! Get it? Like an imitation crab?\u201d\n\nI studied a large pair of axes the labels claimed to have been responsible for an entire family\u2019s death. \u201cAster, how does this look?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t cursed or anything, but,\u201d Aster, amongst being able to sense the bizarre, also had a knack for both history and economical appreciation, \u201cI think the Maxfield\u2019s will buy it for a fair price.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn it goes!\u201d And I swept them off and into the bag.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a vampire\u2019s favorite fruit?\u201d Matt continued, pointing his gun around every corner. \u201cA neck-tarine!\u201d\n\nI think that, among the many other jokes, broke Aster. \u201cOh my god Matt, shut up!\u201d her voice echoed throughout the museum, and for a second, all was quiet but for her echo. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\nI elbowed Matt. He sighed and shut up.\n\nSomething rustled up ahead, brushing against the shelves and stores. \u201cUp ahead,\u201d Matt murmured, training his weapon. He set the silencer and aimed.\n\nA shambling gluttonous thing shambled into view.\n\nA rotten smell filled me, and a glance at the thing sent my fear into play. It was sluglike, yet looked like decaying human flesh. A scrambling of eyes blinked at us, and several mouths snarled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Fleshweave,\u201d Matt murmured, training his sights. \u201cAlways wondered when I\u2019d get to kill one.\u201d\n\nThe fattened creature made a fleshy, moist noise and hands erupted from inside it, hands that reached outwards toward us. Matt fired quickly at the being, bursts obliterating hands and creatures holes that blood and pus erupted from.\n\nA severed arm wrapped itself around my leg. I plunged my knife into it. Aster concentrated herself, then placing her hands upon one of the detached limbs, burning it.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you learn that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNew book,\u201d she shrugged, fighting off more limbs, \u201cgreat book.\u201d\n\nSteven unlatched a a cube from his belt and threw it into one of the creatures mouths. \u201cHave a snack!\u201d\n\nThe bright light enveloped the beast, and suddenly, we were covered in blood, flesh, and substances I dare not name.\n\n\u201cDid you hear that?!\u201d someone shouted, one neither Steven nor the three of us.\n\n\u201cIt ssssssounded like gunfire,\u201d a hissing, higher voice snarled. \u201cAnd a ssssnack.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s the Company?\u201d a third voice wondered.\n\nOther looters were here. I was right; we weren\u2019t the only ones with the idea. And the footsteps were heading our way. I turned a shelf, my team followed and we hid.\n\nThe three appeared, disgusted at the mess of flesh and blood.\n\nTwo were human, a man and a woman dressed in light gear. The third was a Serpenthead, using its strength to carry an overflowing backpack on its back. It licked the air, but I hoped the dead would out-stench us.\n\n\u201cI ssssmell ssssomething!\u201d it snarled, loudly being echoed by the walls.\n\n\u201cJesus, lizardman, keep it down,\u201d the man silenced.\n\nThe Serpenthead stared sternly at the man. \u201cI told you, Jeffery, that is a slur. We are called SsssStetski.\u201d Jeffery sighed, clearly annoyed. \u201cIf you find that a bit too challenging, you may call us Serpentheads.\u201d\n\nThe woman spoke, \u201cDon\u2019t insult the Stetski, Jeff, you know better.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine, Eve-\u201d the man stopped. \u201cOver there.\u201d My skin froze. Fear leapt in my throat. Had he seen us?\n\nThere was a grunt nearby, and a deathly howl. I dared a closer peek- they were hiding from a Paleskin, quiet now. The creature sniffed the air and began to approach us.\n\n\u201cThe ssssusssspensssse is killing me!\u201d the Stetski snarled, rushing out, and pouncing upon the confused, undead priest. The undead groaned in something like pain. \u201cSssstupid Paleskin.\u201d\n\nWith a deafening crack, the Serpenthead twisted the undead\u2019s neck. The body fell gracefully to the floor, and the weight of the Stetski caused a fleshy crunch.\n\nThis is when a loud, wooden bang was heard throughout the mansion, and both we and the rival looters froze in place. There was a click of something being connecting, then three warning shots into the air.\n\n\u201cThis is the Company,\u201d a woman announced, the voice echoing throughout. \u201cAny looter who does not leave in the next thirty seconds will be in violation of the anti-terrorism act of 1776!\u201d\n\nThe Stetski swore.\n\nI heard boots on the ground and gunfire as they quickly exterminated the rest of Gilmore\u2019s undead guards. And it was also time for us to leave.\n\nThe thirty second rule was never enforced- they would simply shoot us on sight.\n\n\u201cYou guys!\u201d I whisper-shouted, gathering the attention of the surprised trio. They met my eyes through the shelves. \u201cThat\u2019s right, you with the Stetski.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Jeffery demanded.\n\n\u201cIf we work together, we can get out of here,\u201d I offered. The trio thought about it awhile, and agreed.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Steven?\u201d Matt reminded. He held up his radio. \u201cSteven, meet us outside when you can.\u201d\n\nSteven replied, \u201cYou got it.\u201d\n\nI sized the trio up, and came up with a plan. The Stetski (who\u2019s name I later learned was Tim) would use his agility, strength to distract the agents heading our way, hiding into the shadows and avoiding capture.\n\nAster would keep an open mind, creating, in her words, a \u201cmap of every living thing in the mansion.\u201d\n\nThe two would stick with us, and we\u2019d move as a group.\n\nFor the most part, it worked. The Stetski jumped from shelf to shelf, outwitting Company agents and pushing artifacts to the ground, releasing the protective sigils and unleashing viscous spirits.\n\nThey fought, spraying salts, holy water and bursts of silver bullets into the air.\n\n\u201cUp ahead!\u201d Aster warned, sensing. \u201cTwo.\u201d\n\nThe Stetski was busy. I acted on impulse, pushing a shelf into the two. We ran as it fell, escaping onto another hall, nearing the entrance, then stopping.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019d we-\u201d Eve stopped when she saw what I did.\n\nGuarding the entrance were a dozen or so agents, four armed with turrets that sat cleanly on the floor. A woman with a dozen patches on her uniform sat in a chair, directing moves onto a tablet.\n\nMatt turned to me for advice. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt them.\u201d I ordered. \u201cBut we need a way out.\u201d\n\nHe unhooked a different cube from his belt and threw it, no hesitation. One of the perimeter agents picked up, confused. \u201cCover your eyes.\u201d\n\nThe cube exploded into brilliant light, blinding the Company. We took the chance to run, passing the blinded agents and out.\n\nThey fired blindly, hearing us move, but through sheer luck we avoided them all, bursting forth from the building and-\n\n\u201cPut your hands where we can see them!\u201d Six more in front of us, guns pointed at our heads. Ah well, it was a decent try.\n\nAnd then a shadow leapt above us, and the Stetski ripped into the group, confusing and tearing them to shreds- so much for my non-violence plan.\n\nThe group inside the building emerged, firing at us. We ran for cover- but we were slowly being surrounded at all sides.\n\nI heard in a voice in my head. \u201cRun on the count of three.\u201d It was Steven\u2019s. \u201cOne- two-\u201d the wind picked up, \u201c-three!\u201d\n\nAnd then the grass rose into the air and became beasts of green and brown. Thes spirit-wolves brought by an unseen Steven attacked the agents, who fired. They did not harm them, though, Steven was smart.\n\nI saw another car, the trio\u2019s. \u201cLooks like this,\u201d I waved, saying goodbye, \u201cis where we part.\u201d\n\nThe Stetski caught up from the chaos. \u201cPleasssure doing business with you.\u201d Even in the chaos, he handed me a card. That guy was dedicated.\n\nSteven, in the car, held the door open, and we practically jumped in. The Company fired, bullets hitting an unseen shield.\n\n\u201cDrive!\u201d I yelled. \u201cDrive!\u201d\n\nSteven turned his attention to the getaway, shield falling. Bullet holes emerged on our side, but the enchanted metal saved our engine.\n\nThey started to give chase, and as we hit the main road a black truck was on our tail.\n\nI made my way to the back of the van. \u201cGive me the backpack!\u201d Aster handed it to me. I opened the back doors of the van. \u201cYou want your artifacts?\u201d I found a particularly potent crystal skull we\u2019d sold to the client. \u201cTake them!\u201d\n\nI tossed the skull through the van, hitting the van and causing its thin protection shield to fail.\n\nA creature burst forth from the skull, one with far too many limbs and eyes. Terrified, the truck veered off the side of the road, just as we reached a bridge, tumbling off into a river, the creature washed away as it did.\n\nMatt cheered at our victory. Aster joined in, and so did me and Steven.\n\nThree black cars appeared in the horizon, following us. \u201cNot today- Steven!\u201d\n\nSteven whispered something and the bridge deconstructed, falling into wooden planks and falling into the river. The Company cars stopped their tracks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve outplayed them,\u201d Matt cheered. \u201cWe outmaneuvered the Company!\u201d\n\nBut I didn\u2019t feel so cheery.\n\nSure, we\u2019d escaped with more than enough to cut our debt in half- but I wondered if we\u2019d attracted a much larger, more powerful enemy. If decided to, the Company would crush us in an instant.\n\nI could only hope they didn\u2019t see us. Sure, we didn\u2019t hurt them in any way- but the Stetski had, and they had no way of identifying our two groups.\n\n\u201cWe've broken a rule,\u201d I murmured, quietly, to myself.\n\nA tacit code had been broken. One did not simply attack the Company. One was supposed to disappear out of sight, out of mind. But what was done, was done.\n\nTomorrow would be another day. \u201cLook too far from a success,\u201d my father had once said, \u201cand you\u2019ll find yourself ever worrying.\u201d\n\nThings were good. Celebration was in order.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Issue #5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13g5lnp/i_sell_cursed_artifacts_for_a_living_in_an_old/)\n\n[Issue 7: Final](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13iotg7/i_sell_cursed_artifacts_for_a_living_the_art_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[House of Lorreno](https://www.reddit.com/r/JulianPageInstitute/)",

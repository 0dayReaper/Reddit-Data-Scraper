    "postText": "My father named me Laika because when I was born, my grandfather told him to treat me like a bad dog. To Father, *Laika* was synonymous with *dog*. He used the name to remind me of my place in the hierarchy: lesser. Beneath. Inferior.\n\nNothing but a dog. \n\nMy father meant to humiliate and degrade me with such a name, but he honored me instead.\n\nYou see, Laika was a stray dog from Moscow. On 3 November 1957, the Soviet Union put her on Sputnik 2 and launched her into space. She was the very first animal to orbit Earth.\n\nThe Soviets knew how to put a rocket into space, but they didn\u2019t know how to bring it back. This made Laika\u2019s mission a death sentence. Shortly after reaching orbit, the interior of Sputnik 2 became catastrophically hot \u2013 far too hot for mammals to tolerate. Mere hours after launch, Laika died an agonizing death. She perished the same way she\u2019d lived: lesser, beneath, inferior. Abandoned. Unloved.\n\nNothing but a dog.\n\nI spent many hours imagining her terror, pain, and loneliness. How would it feel, spending my last hours hurtling through divine darkness in a metal bucket?\n\nWhat must it be like to not understand what I was seeing, or why it was suddenly so loud and so hot?\n\nWhat must it be like to not understand why \u2013 after being plucked from cruel streets and dropped into a bustling world of kindness \u2013 I was now alone? Perhaps I would think I\u2019d been a bad dog. Perhaps I\u2019d think this was my punishment.\n\nPunishment is my mother tongue. I know what it was like to be punished for transgressions I cannot remember or understand, to be hurt so badly my heart rate triples and my mind flies out the window and soars into the stars, retracing Laika\u2019s doomed flight while my husk squirms and weeps on the floor of a dirty house sixty-eight miles below. \n\nEven so, I adapted to punishment. As I said, it eventually becomes a language. Given enough time, anyone can learn a language.\n\nWhat I could not adapt to was fear. \n\nAs a child, I was afraid of everything. You see, in the deepest, most forgotten parts of the world, there are things that most people cannot believe and even fewer would understand. Old ways, old things, old truths. \n\nAnd old monsters.\n\nMonsters like my father and my grandfather. \n\nHow can I describe this in a way you will believe? Maybe I can\u2019t. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t try. So instead, I will describe my grandfather.\n\nHe was called Paval. By the time I turned nine, he had gone through six bodies. By this, I mean he inhabited them. Using a variant of blood magic perfected by my forebears across many centuries, he leapt from body to body.\n\nHe was not a spirit; he had a corporeal body of his own, a twisted, monstrous thing covered in scars and hard, glittering skin, a body that could shrink to the size of a garden snake or expand to the size of a house.\n\nBut for all its marvels, this body was weak; sunlight burnt its eyes and blistered its flesh. So it entered other bodies, like a hand inside a puppet, and wore them until they rotted away. I will never forget the sight of him \u2013 of many hims \u2013 in different bodies as flesh degraded and fell away in wet, discolored strings. Or the way his eyes \u2013 hard, round yellow eyes \u2013 glinted deep within their stolen sockets.\n\nGrandfather preferred the bodies of men, but sometimes chose women or children. Once, he even wore the body of my mother. I was very young then \u2013 perhaps three \u2013 and the sight of her familiar form standing before the fire sent me into such transports of joy that I bawled from sheer ecstasy.\n\nThen she turned around, and in her bruised sockets I saw my grandfather\u2019s eyes: flat, glittering yellow. Like rotted gold.\n\nI reared back, screaming.\n\nMy father, who had been stroking a pair of old baby shoes, looked at me with contempt so deep it scorched my heart. \u201cShut up, dog!\u201d\n\nI cringed. This was a mistake; his contempt exploded into disgust. He shot out of his chair and stomped upon me. Dirty, squirmy pain exploded across my abdomen. I hobbled away, whimpering, and hid under the stairs.\n\nI lay there alone for many hours. Eventually my mind left my body and soared into the sky, a reverse dive into a sea of stars. I drifted away, dreaming of diamond-colored constellations and red nebulae. At my side was a curly-tailed dog with a striped face. My namesake. \n\nLaika.\n\nWhen I woke, I *felt* her: furry and warm, chest rising and falling under my hand. I opened my eyes. For just an instant I saw her in the shadows. Then she shrank away, sinking into the ground. I tried to grab her, but the floor swallowed her. My fingers closed on cold, hard floorboards. \n\nI covered my eyes and wept.\n\nSeveral months later, Grandfather-Within-Mother gave birth to a child. A baby boy with yellow eyes and my father\u2019s curly black hair. Mere minutes after the birth, Father picked up the baby and took him outside. He returned an hour later, empty-handed.\n\nSpurred by horror, I immediately ran out into the night. The cold was brutal, at once invigorating and exhausting. I searched until I found the baby, whimpering weakly beside a snowdrift. He was still covered in birth blood.\n\nI named him Alexander and brought him home.\n\nWhen I walked in, Father immediately slapped me. I reeled back as stars rocketed across my vision. \u201cNever,\u201d he hissed, contempt dripping from every syllable, \u201cnever disobey again. Give him to me now.\u201d He reached for Alexander, but Grandfather stopped him.\n\nI looked up, and swallowed a whimper. Grandfather stared back at me through my mother\u2019s rotting face. The mouth \u2013 puffy and discolored, with an oddly detached look \u2013 quirked into a smile. \u201cNo. Let the dog keep her pup. We have other concerns.\u201d \n\nThey certainly did; they worked together, and they worked constantly. Father kidnapped victims, and Grandfather used them. Whenever Father brought a new victim to the cabin, Grandfather used his hands \u2013 long, hideous things marked with scars and covered in strange, glittering flesh \u2013 to tear out the victim\u2019s tongue and crush their feet. \n\nThen he would wait until nightfall \u2013 because remember, sunlight burned Grandfather\u2019s eyes and blistered his skin - and carry them to his Chapel.\n\nHis Chapel was an ancient stone structure at the base of a wooded hill. Within the chapel were three red windows and six rough-hewn pews. At the end of each pew sat desiccated corpses, facing the altar like sentries.\n\nI hated Grandfather\u2019s chapel; the very air weighed upon me whenever I entered, crushing my heart and poisoning my lungs. The worst part was the fear: electric and paralyzing, inescapable.\n\nLuckily, I was just a dog, and dogs do not spend much time inside chapels. But dogs hear screams. Even screams from far away, echoing down forested mountains long into the night. \n\nGrandfather did not often leave his Chapel, but when he did it was always in the wee hours of the morning. I know this because my father and I were required to hold vigil until he walked through our door. Whenever Grandfather came back from his Chapel, he looked human again: smooth skin, wide smile, good proportions. Sometimes he looked a bit like Father. Sometimes he looked like his victim.\n\nIt was as incomprehensible to me as outer space would have been to Laika. \n\nThe stream of Grandfather\u2019s victims never ended. Vagrants, the elderly, the travelers, orphans fleeing violence. There were so many.\n\nSo, so many.\n\nIf it weren\u2019t for Alexander, I would have withered into nothing. He was more than a brother to me; for all intents and purposes, he was my son. Neither Father nor Grandfather cared for him. They didn\u2019t even feed or clothe him; I had to feed and dress him with what little I had. \n\nDespite my best efforts, he never learned to speak. That isn\u2019t to say he couldn\u2019t communicate \u2013 he could, with gestures and facial expressions and nonsense syllables \u2013 but language eluded him. But it was all right. He grew into a sweet, curious boy with freckles and long, delicate hands. Over time, his terrible yellow eyes mellowed into a clear, bright green. He was my life. He was my heart.\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nOne night, as a little girl\u2019s screams came shrieking down the mountain from Grandfather\u2019s Chapel, I finally went to my father.\n\nI lay prostrate at his feet, which is how he taught me to approach him. The wooden floor was rough and painfully cold under my fingers. \u201cWhy, Father? Why do you do this?\u201d\n\nHe sat in his chair, watching the fire. In his hands he held a pair of white baby shoes. \u201cBecause your Grandfather and I must live, little dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill I have to do this to live?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I don\u2019t want to live.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand,\u201d he said. His grip tightened on the shoes. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d\n\nI choked back a sob and waited for the dismissal; I could not come to him without crawling, and I could not leave until he told me so.\n\nInstead, he said, \u201cStand up, Laika.\u201d\n\nHearing my name was like being doused in ice water. He never used it; by that point, in fact, I\u2019d almost forgotten I had a name.\n\n\u201cI said, stand up, Laika.\u201d\n\nIt was a struggle to obey; fear made my bones rubbery and my muscles weak. \n\nFather held out the baby shoes. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d\n\n\u201cShoes.\u201d My voice quavered. \u201cOld baby shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose shoes,\u201d Father said, \u201cbelonged my sister, Alexandra. I loved her more than anything. More than life. More than my parents. More than your mother. More than you. She was my heart.\u201d\n\nI watched him. The firelight threw his face into relief, creating crevasses out of wrinkles. His curly black hair shifted like smoke, and his long, sharp nose looked strange and monstrous. Paralytic electricity swarmed my skin, so much like the Chapel that I could have wept.\n\n\u201cOn my twelfth birthday,\u201d Father said, \u201cyour grandfather boiled a pot of oil and called Alexandra to him. She and I were going to pick wildflowers later, so she was dressed in her finest clothes: a blue dress and white shoes. These shoes.\u201d \n\nFather did not speak for a very long while.\n\n\u201cShe was my heart,\u201d he finally repeated. \u201cWhen my heart broke, I broke. It made me like Grandfather. Someday, I will be just like him. I will live forever. You will, too.\u201d \n\nThat night, I had a nightmare of a little girl with sunken yellow eyes melting into blisters as my mother\u2019s rotted body doused her with boiling oil. \n\nI woke screaming.\n\nMoonlight streamed through the window, drenching my room in celestial silver. My heart thumped so wildly that I could see my nightshirt moving. It wanted to escape. I wanted it to escape, to, because without it I would die, and when I was dead I could sail the stars with the other Laika.\n\nSmall, warm hands touched my face. I turned, expecting Alexander. Instead I saw my nightmare. \n\nGreat inflamed blisters bubbled and burst, sending rivulets of pus down her tiny, raw face. The skin around its mouth had burned away, leaving neat rows of milk teeth fully exposed. Burned scalp and dull bone glinted through black, curly hair. A blue dress clung to her body. Oil dripped from the hem, soaking my blanket.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d she whispered.\n\nAlexander stirred between us.\n\n\u201cGet out,\u201d I whispered.\n\nThe girl\u2019s blistered chin quivered. \u201cBut you made me come here. Please let me sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I whispered, because I did not know what else to say.\n\nThe girl burrowed under my blanket. I watched, aghast, as she threw a bony, burnt arm across Alexander and drifted to sleep.  \n\nThat night, I did not sail the stars with Laika. Instead I sat awake, watching the apparition with mingled excitement and fear.\n\nJust before dawn, my door creaked open. I tried to shield the girl as my father stepped into the room. \n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d he asked sharply.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d I whined. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe girl shifted, and \u2013 incredibly \u2013 began to shrink. Her body flattened into nothing, leaving her dress crumpled on the floor. That sank away, too, leaving the cold, empty floor in its wake.\n\n\u201c*What was that?*\u201d Father screamed.\n\n\u201cI saw it in my sleep \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201c*Her!*\u201d Father roared. \u201c*Her*, not *it*!\u201d\n\n\u201cI s-saw her in my sleep,\u201d I stammered helplessly. \u201cWhen I woke, she was here.\u201d\n\nSweat gleamed on Father\u2019s skin, reminding me of stars. \u201cGet dressed. You must see your grandfather immediately.\u201d\n\nI fell to my hands and knees and crawled to him. \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cStand up. Bring the boy.\u201d\n\nAlexander wept angrily when I picked him up. I ignored him and followed Father into the dark forest. The full glory of early spring bathed the landscape: pale beams of light shafted through the canopy, cutting the thick shadows with gold. Vermin crept through the undergrowth, and deer watched from a distance. The forest was always full of animals; Grandfather was no danger to the birds or beasts, after all.\n\nSoon the Chapel came into view: an ancient little church with a black spire, red windows, and frost-encrusted stones. \n\nFather ushered us inside. The moment I crossed the threshold, my skin began to crawl. Dread and fear swept over me. Alexander burst into tears.\n\nFather shoved me toward the altar. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the sentry corpses twitching. Chests rose and fell in jagged, senseless rhythms. One especially tall corpse with long copper hair turned as I passed.\n\nI covered Alexander\u2019s eyes and stopped at the altar.\n\nShadows thickened and writhed against the back wall. Back in the pews, bones clattered and dried joints creaked.\n\nSomething blinked in the darkness behind the altar: great, flat eyes like golden moons, shining in the cold shadows. \n\nGrandfather.\n\n\u201cThe dog,\u201d Grandfather intoned, \u201cand her pup.\u201d He snarled: a deep, bone-shaking rumble like that of a tiger. Teeth glinted in the shadows, a shining ivory arc wider than Father\u2019s entire head.\n\n\u201cPaval,\u201d Father said urgently. \u201cShe had a nightmare. When she woke, it followed her out of the dream. It came alive. I saw it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Grandfather murmured. \u201c*Oh.*\u201d\n\n\u201cOur little dog has talent after all,\u201d said Father.\n\n\u201cAll good and well,\u201d said Grandfather, \u201c*if* she loves her pup. Do you love your pup, dog?\u201d He reared up from the shadows, twisted and sinewy and utterly inhuman. \u201cDo you love him? Or do you feel *obligated* to him?\u201d\n\nI opened my mouth to answer. Instead, I burst into tears.\n\nGrandfather laughed, a low roar that shook dust from the rafters overhead. \u201cA weak bitch indeed. Our hope is in the boy, Mikhail. It was always in the boy. That is why we made him. Now go.\u201d Those great yellow eyes flicked to the pews. \u201cI do not like to tempt my sentries. Not when they are hungry as they are.\u201d\n\nFear and disbelief battled across Father\u2019s weathered face. \u201cDo you not understand what I\u2019ve told you? She creates life from thoughts.\u201d\n\n\u201cA poor substitute for what we require. Leave, Mikhail.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2013 \u201d\n\nGrandfather rocketed out of the shadows, a rippling mass of glittering skin and malformed limbs, and knocked Father to the stones.\n\nThe corpse-sentries uttered a deep sigh and continued to twitch.\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d Grandfather snarled. Sunlight poured through the crimson windows, imbuing him strange hide with a red glow. He looked like the sky. A starry piece of outer space. \u201cNever defy me.\u201d \n\nI waited breathlessly for Grandfather\u2019s eyes to burst and his skin to sizzle \u2013 he was, after all, exposed to daylight \u2013 but it did not.\n\nMany moments later, Grandfather struck Father across the face and whipped back into the darkness.\n\nWe left. Father did not speak again until the cottage came into sight. Then he grabbed me and dragged me off the path.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d he growled. \u201cListen well. I can protect you from him. And\u2026\u201d He looked down at Alexander, eyes blazing with disgust. \u201cWhen the time comes, I can protect you from *him*, too.  But only if you help me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should I need protection? He\u2019s small, and loves me as a mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you remember the story of Alexandra?\u201d Father asked.\n\nI nodded.\n\n\u201cYour story is coming. Only Alexander will be me, and you will be Alexandra.\u201d\n\nMy heart fell to the cold earth. I carefully pressed Alexander\u2019s head into my shoulder, shielding his face from Father. \n\n\u201cListen, dog. When next you dream of my sister \u2013\u201d His voice broke; he pulled away and ran his fingers through his hair. Tears shone in his eyes, which were huge and miserable over his quivering mouth. \u201cWhen she comes again, bring her to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, Father.\u201d I had never seen him weep before; the sight was frightening and curiously thrilling. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\nFather nodded curtly, then left. I nearly followed, but thought better of it. Instead, I stayed in the forest with Alexander.\n\nAs the morning brightened and birdsong swelled to a symphony, I set Alexander upon the narrow path. He ran forward, humming a tune of his own composition. Shadow and sunlight dappled his skin, turning him into a woodland sprite. The trees were in full bloom: petals drifted down like snow, carpeting the earth in glistening white.\n\nAlexander pulled ahead. After a while, I couldn\u2019t hear or see him; he\u2019d drifted away, slipping into the deep shadows.\n\nPanic overtook me. \u201cAlexander! *Alexander!*\u201d I rushed ahead, grimacing against the pain in my chest. My heart thumped wildly, so hard I could see my shirt move; it wanted to escape again. \u201c*Alexander!*\u201d\n\nHe darted from between the trees. I halted, overcome with relief so powerful it took my breath away. Petals covered his head and shoulders. As I watched, one drifted down and settled on his nose. Wide green eyes glimmered above it, bright as the promise of spring.\n\nFor the first time in my life, my heart was so full that I wept.\n \nThat night, Alexandra came to me again, blistered flesh dripping down her face. Her eyes had melted away, leaving raw, swollen masses of flesh in her melted sockets.\n\nRemembering my instructions, I sat up. \u201cFather,\u201d I quavered. Alexandra reached for me blindly, ruined hands closing on shadows. \u201cFather!\u201d\n\nFather burst into my room, gasping. \u201cAlexandra!\u201d He shot forward, arms extended as if to sweep her up.\n\nShe turned.\n\nFather froze.\n\nAlexandra tottered toward him. \u201cMikhail,\u201d she whined. \u201cMikhail, my eyes hurt.\u201d\n\nFather collapsed and covered his eyes as Alexandra approached. She left a trail of pus and oil, shining like a tiny river in the moonlight.\n\n\u201cMikhail, my hands hurt.\u201d\n\nFather wheezed miserably.\n\n\u201cMikhail, my skin is on fire and drips away.\u201d She stopped before him and crouched. Father whimpered and whined like a beaten dog, twisting away from her hands. \n\nShe set her small hand on his cheek. Father squalled and writhed, but couldn\u2019t break away from her. \u201cMikhail,\u201d she wept. \u201cYou are just like him now.\u201d She jerked and began to shrink, to sink, disappearing into the floor. The moment her hand fell away, Father leapt to his feet and ran.\n\nAfter that, he did not ask to see Alexandra.\n\nThis is good, because I did not see her in my dreams after that. I only saw Laika. I spent most nights drifting among the stars with that dear, doomed dog at my side. Imagined or not, the sights were glorious: incomprehensibly beautiful star formations, planets, great multicolored expanses of celestial mists.\n\n\nSometimes I woke, bleary and incoherent, and felt her fur against my skin. But by the time I opened my eyes, there was nothing.\n\nOne winter morning, I woke very early. My stomach growled immediately, and no wonder; Father hadn\u2019t fed me for days. I\u2019d fed Alexander with table scraps and tree bark. \n\nThat, I decided, would change today.\n\nI crept into the kitchen. There wasn\u2019t much; there never was. But I scraped together what little I could, and turned around.\n\nMy grandfather sat at the table, great golden eyes shimmering in his terrible face. \u201cLittle bitch. What have you done to your father? He no longer hunts. He no longer eats. He no longer obeys.\u201d \n\nI felt like I was back in his chapel: crushed by darkness, heavy with dread, on the verge of panic.\n\n\u201cYour ability,\u201d said Grandfather, \u201chas not been seen on this earth for a thousand years or more.\u201d\n\nOf course the ability wasn\u2019t of earth; I\u2019d no doubt come across it while sailing through space and breathing stardust. \u201cIt\u2019s just nightmares.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. You take the dark things of the world \u2013 the fear, the hate, the pain - and channel them into physical form. And that is just the beginning. You will be able to do anything. You will make bodies. Permanent, perfect bodies for me\u2026and for you.\u201d\n\nThe relish in his voice made me sick.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur women have always been weak and talentless. I thought the same of you, little bitch.\u201d\n\nTears pricked my eyes and my bones thrummed as if struggling to break through flesh and run away. But it was no use; destiny had already bloomed between my grandfather and I, heavy and foul with the promise of despair. \n\nGrandfather whispered, \u201cListen closely, for you will only hear this once: *I was wrong.*\u201d\n\nHe left. I ran to the window and watched him hurtle through the trees as sunrise threatened. Back to his Chapel. \n\nI waited until the sun was up. Then I ran to my room, bundled Alexander in every bit of clothing I could find, and left.\n\nWe followed the path for many miles. Our home was hours and hours from the nearest town; we wouldn\u2019t reach it until long past nightfall. I could only hope that Grandfather wouldn\u2019t notice our absence until the following day. It wasn\u2019t an unlikely hope; Grandfather spent most of his time in the Chapel.\n\nThe second this thought crossed my mind, a glittering dark shape leapt out of the trees and knocked Alexander from my arms.\n\nI caught a blur of twisted limbs and nightmarish hands, of great yellow eyes like flattened moons. Alexander screamed as a torrent of blood splattered across the snow. It sank quickly, melting red canyons through the pristine white.\n\nGrandfather at me, narrow sides heaving. Then he leaned down and tore out Alexander\u2019s throat.\n\nI screamed. Birds took flight and mammals ran through the undergrowth. The piercing note echoed off the mountains. The pain within it should have ended the world, but there was no one to hear and no one to care.\n\nGrandfather grinned. Alexander\u2019s blood and sinews clung to his teeth.\n\nI broke. \n\nI felt it; the crushing weight of sorrow, the almost physical sensation of my spirit tearing and bleeding out into my guts.\n\nI fell to my knees and cradled Alexander\u2019s head for hours.\n\nMy father finally found us around nightfall. He had a heel of bread and an oily chicken leg. He pressed them both into my hands, then left. \n\nI tore the bread into pieces and dropped them, one by one, into Alexander\u2019s mouth. When he did not wake, I burst into tears and hurled the chicken leg into the woods.\n\nThe moon rose into the cruel, dark sky. Stars glimmered through the bare branches over head, creating a breathtaking fractal pattern.\n\nI flopped down beside Alexander, pulling him to my body. He was cold. Terribly cold. I held him anyway, keeping my eyes trained on the stars. My mind detached with great difficulty, like it was trapped in tar.\n\nFinally, it wrenched itself free and sailed upward, disappearing into a silvery sea of sky and stars, rocketing ever higher until I saw the Earth spinning below.\n\nLaika\u2019s rocket zoomed past. I reached out and caught one of the metal bars near the nose. I could sense Laika within: her terror vibrated through the craft and leached into my bloodstream.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Laika. I\u2019m here. When you land, I will help you out and we will play together.\u201d\n\nHer fear diminished, and so did her pain. So did mine. Together we sailed the stars, looking upon the Earth and marveling at the incomprehensible beauty around us.\n\nI woke cold, sore, and in more pain than I can describe.\n\nI sat up. Alexander\u2019s stiff body broke away from mine. I reached for him blindly. A thin scrim of ice covered his eyes. The wound in his throat was an open horror, one I couldn\u2019t look at for long.\n\nI drew my knees to my chin and wept. \n\nAfter a while, something warm bumped my hand. A wet nose touched my palm. I knew what I would see long before I opened my eyes.\n\nLaika\u2019s striped face and dear curly tail made me smile, even through my tears. Stars glimmered through her fur, gently pulsing pinpricks of light.\n\n \u201cWhat is this?\u201d Grandfather\u2019s voice echoed through the trees.\n\nRage flowed through my blood, exquisitely corrosive. Hate, I learned then, is pleasurable; it is fury and it is the basis of power. \n\nGrandfather erupted from the darkness, scaled skin shimmering like a river under the moon. \u201cYou waste your talent,\u201d he sneered, \u201con a mutt. Not even your own pup! No matter. I will correct you.\u201d\n\nLaika reared up and leapt, snout piercing one of Grandfather\u2019s flat moon eyes. He screamed and shook his head back and forth. Laika fell to the snow, twisting, and quickly righted herself. Then she bit his foot. Her teeth sank through that impenetrable, immortal hide like butter. \n\nLaika was not large enough or strong enough to kill him, but she tore holes in him the way a match scorches holes in paper. Soon Grandfather was on his knees, mere feet from Alexander\u2019s corpse.\n\nLaika came to me, panting, and collapsed in my lap. She bled from a thousand wounds: some small, some undoubtedly mortal.\n\n\u201cGood dog.\u201d My voice broke. I stroked her gently, willing those wounds to close. I was a monster. I\u2019d used Laika just like the others had; calling her down on false pretenses, filling her with hope, before throwing her into the void. \u201cGood girl. Good, good girl.\u201d\n\nI looked up as Grandfather\u2019s good eye slid to my dead brother. Something dark bloomed there: a wicked, corrupted hope. He curled in on himself, twisted body shrinking to a withered husk, and slid down Alexander\u2019s throat. \n\nI screamed as Alexander\u2019s body twitched and juddered. Then he sat up, bones creaking and frozen sinews cracking.\n\nHe smiled. His eyes shone like molten gold in a forge. \n\nLaika attacked again. Alexander\u2019s face curled into a snarl as she bit and tore his skin, exhibiting an energy at odds with her awful wounds.\n\nI watched, helpless and hopeless and hurting, wishing I could detach and fly into the stars once more. Except there would be nothing there for me now; I\u2019d called Laika down from the stars and doomed her.\n\nThe snow crunched behind me. I whirled around. Father stood there, watching me with contempt. In his hands was a sleek, gleaming shotgun.\n\nRelief and horror engulfed me. This was the end. My mind would detach, forever this time. The fear would finally end.\n\nLaika bit down on Grandfather-within-Alexander, who hit her. She whined, but held fast.\n\nFather stalked past me and cocked the gun.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d I screamed. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt her! *Don\u2019t hurt her!*\u201d\n\nFather pointed the gun at Alexander\u2019s head and fired. Blood and viscera and dark, glittering flesh exploded across the snow.\n\nFather fired again, then reloaded, and fired again and again. Alexander\u2019s head evaporated into red mist. Finally his body lurched, and Grandfather \u2013 small, bleeding, scaled Grandfather \u2013 slithered out of his throat.\n\nLaika caught and held him. Father pressed the barrel of the gun against his good eye and pulled the trigger as the sun broke over the mountains.\n\nFather stepped back. I reached for him, drunk on hope and gratitude, but he recoiled from me. In his weathered face, I saw despair and rage\u2026\n\nAnd contempt.\n\nHe kept his eyes trained on mine as he placed the gun in his mouth.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d I screamed.\n\nHe pulled the trigger. Half his head evaporated, leaving a glistening mass like a fleshy geode. His body stumbled forward a step, then crumpled to the snow. \n\nIt took a very long time for the sun to burn Grandfather down to dirty oil.  Laika held on until the last scrap of skin melted. Then she stumbled to me and collapsed. \n\nI stroked her until her body shrank and sank into the ground, leaving nothing but a scattering of tiny, dim orbs: the stars I\u2019d seen in her fur. I touched one. It was pleasantly hot. I gathered them up and slipped them into my pocket. I went to Alexander\u2019s body \u2013 ravaged beyond description, broken in ways that did not see entirely real \u2013 and sat with him until nightfall. Then I stood and walked away.\n\nAnd life went on.\n\nAt first, I brought them back from my nightmares  \u2013 Alexander, Father, Grandfather, even Alexandra \u2013 but I quickly taught myself to starve and eventually kill my ability. It is not a good power; it is born of rage, despair, selfishness, and fear. \n\nAnd I cannot tolerate fear.\n\nBesides, dogs do not have such awful powers. It is good to be a dog, because they are not necromancers. They are not monsters. They are nothing more or less than the simplest and most loving of creatures.\n\nThat is why I will always be Laika the dog.\n",

I took her to work, had all my classes online, and spent every waking minute with her. \n\nAfter the first month we started training with the focus of helping her with her seperation anxiety from me. We have gotten to the point where she can comfortably spend 4 to 8 hours with someone else. So now she is getting fixed and due to doctors orders she had to spend the night. I have 6 hours till I can head to pick her up and I can't wait. I spent all day harrassing the vet, asking for updates (and they were extremely patient and reassuring), and worrying that she was thinking I left her somewhere for being a 'bad dog', needless to say, this story hit a nerve.

I'm pretty sure your father, grandfather or others who came before them didn't want to become monsters at some point, but you seem to be the first one to sacrifice your power and keep your humanity. There is no need to bring Alexander back from your nightmares, he deserves to rest, and so does Laika. They will always be with you in your dreams of space, keeping you safe and warm. Good luck, OP, live a good life Laika would be proud of.",

But not even having to perform the rigours of the old rituals is insane. You could be a demigod in the making. \nHope all goes well for you now. ",

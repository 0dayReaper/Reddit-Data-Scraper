    "postText": "**\u201cRule #1: Guns don\u2019t do jack.\u201d**\n\nAll the others vary, but this is always the #1 rule at every park in the country.\n\nPersonally, I would have added precisely four extra letters to it, but upper brass insists we need to uphold at least some modicum of professional decorum. Still, there are no words to describe just how frustrated it makes me every single time I see some jagoff standing there gormlessly unloading his magazine into some unfathomable nightmare creature who obviously isn\u2019t going to feel a thing. Once I even saw someone run empty and then try to *reload*, instead of just, I don\u2019t know, *running away*. I was almost glad to see him get exsanguinated.\n\nMany folks have attempted to get creative with it. You name it, they\u2019ve tried it. Silver bullets, 50 caliber high explosive incendiary ammunition, shotgun slugs cased in gold carved out from the Ark of the Covenant and pumped full of aglaophotis and blessed by the pope himself\u2026 and nothing. Nada. Zilch. As far as I know, throughout the entire history of the NPS, not a single bullet we\u2019ve fired has even lightly tickled any of God\u2019s half-finished rejects that stalk the wilderness.\n\nI guess we just have trouble coping with the fact that our generation\u2019s favorite hammer doesn\u2019t work on this particular nail. In all fairness, though, there\u2019s a psychological benefit to holding a gun, even knowing this foremost rule. It\u2019s a lot more bearable to weave through trees in the pitch black wood miles from civilization when you have ol\u2019 Remington\u2019s gift to humanity gripped in your shaking hands. Venturing out with just your bare fists feels like you may as well give up, drop trou, bend over, and hope the thing with forty thousand eyes is feeling romantic.\n\nI have to admit, even I keep my trusty old 1911 on my hip, even knowing it\u2019d be absolutely useless for anything but putting a round through my own brain stem in case I get cornered by any of the things you *really* don\u2019t want capturing you alive.\n\n**\u201cRule 2: Handheld UV lights are required when bushwhacking after midnight so fluorescent spider silk may be seen and avoided. If caught by a strand, or if you feel the earth beginning to part beneath you, throw down a circle of salt, recite the Gayatri Mantra, and clap exactly thrice.\u201d**\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve wondered how we even come up with the really elaborate and specific rules like this one. The answer\u2019s simple: a little bit of occult research, and a hell of a lot of deadly trial and error.\n\nSure, sometimes we get lucky and somebody else does our homework for us. For example, up at Isle Royale, an Ojibwe elder was kind enough to provide us with a few rules that help greatly when dealing with\u2026 well, you-know-what. Sorry, but never referring to them by name was one of the rules. In general, though, if you see a rule emphasizing that you have to clap *exactly* thrice, you can bet it\u2019s because some poor bastard tried clapping two times or four times and ended up paying the ultimate price for it.\n\nIn this case, it was Annemary, or \u2018Crazy Anne\u2019. I worked by her side for twenty years, at least. She was a hell of a woman, the kind who made everyone hush into a terrified silence whenever she walked into a room. Still, even she wasn\u2019t as scary as that spider-thing that kept her alive for a week in his web while he extra-orally digested her. He was a right bastard, and for a while I worried we\u2019d have to write off Shenandoah as a lost cause\u2026 but since this rule was put into place, the evil cunt has been more or less left to starve. I consider it my magnum opus.\n\nWe only pulled it off because of you, Anne, you crazy diamond. Once you\u2019ve conquered Hell, save a spot for me beside your throne, okay?\n\n**\u201cRule 3: If approached by a man with the head of a deer, offer to make him tea. He likes it strong with milk and two sugars. Sit with him as he drinks, and respond to him with absolute politeness and good manners at all times. Never ask him his name.\u201d**\n\nYou\u2019ll be pleased to know that not every strange thing that lurks in these parks is the sort that yearns to tear your intestines out through your arsehole while you cry for mommy. Just like real wild animals, a vast majority of them just want us humans to leave \u2018em alone\u2026 and a few even *like* us. \n\nWe\u2019ve got a swell arrangement worked out with this peculiar deer-man who manifests in front of rangers on graveyard shift every once in a while. That 10 foot tall sonuvabitch has got the body of a man but the head of a stag with a rack any hunter would drool over, the digitigrade legs of a wolf, and he wears these flowing robes which look to be made of the night sky, glimmering stars and all. He talks all cryptic and posh, but all he asks us for is some tea time. In return, he opens that third eye on his forehead and glimpses into the future, giving us a few hints as to what sort of trouble might be brewing in the next few weeks. From our encounters, he seems like a nice enough fellow.\n\nWe only tell you not to ask his name because it\u2019s beyond pronunciation and will just leave your ears bleeding. You know how it is.\n\n**\u201cRule #4: If you hear the wailing of an infant in the woods steadily drawing closer to the park office, open the red lockbox with code 0681. There is a living fetus inside on a bed of satin; pierce its heart with one of the provided golden pin needles until the noises cease.\u201d**\n\nAnother complicated mess of a rule we had to bring in a Goetic daemonologist to help cook up. I know what you\u2019re thinking. Yeah, sure, if we knew more about these things, we could probably pare these rules down some more, come up with something simpler, easier. But the point is that the rules we have now have weathered the test of time and have been proven to keep us safe *consistently*. Once we\u2019ve achieved that consistency, a rule pretty much never changes, since any propositions to study alternatives are always shut down by the question of \u201cwhat happens if your hypothesis doesn\u2019t work?\u201d\n\nOh yeah, by the way. You recall how I mentioned there are certain entities out here you *really* don\u2019t want to get taken alive by? This is definitely one of those. Cutting up that fetus is never very pleasant, but trust me, it\u2019s worth the trouble.\n\nBut if you want to trail blaze and stake your life testing out some theory you cooked up\u2026 be my guest.\n\n**\u201cRule #5: When staying at the old barracks, always cover every mirror in a room before turning out the lights, and never remove or break-\u201c**\n\n\u201cWait. Slow down a second.\u201d \n\nI had not even made it through five rules before the rookie sitting across from me at the cabin rudely interrupted. He was a young man who\u2019d look more at home in Hollywood or Los Angeles than out here in the woods, his immaculately groomed jet black hair slicked to the side like all the posh celebs are doing it. I didn\u2019t have a very good first impression of him, but hell, I always hated when I had to babysit a newbie through a night. Patience was never my strong suit.\n\n\u201cCan I ask why these are all so\u2026 infuriatingly vague?\u201d He continued. \u201cLike, what do I do if forgot to cover a mirror? What happens if I don\u2019t clap three times or whatever?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause there\u2019s fifteen rules even just here in Shenandoah. That might not sound like a lot, but when you\u2019re fighting fer your life \u2018gainst something with more mouths than you have teeth, it\u2019s a hell of a lot to remember. Got to keep details sparse, y\u2019see. Make sure to drill in the important bits. And it wouldn\u2019t help you none to know what happens if you break a rule - it\u2019d only scare ya,\u201d I explained. \u201cNow shut your yapper while I finish reminding you of \u2018em all.\u201d\n\nHe groaned. \u201cI\u2019ve already heard them far too many times. At least a thousand today.\u201d\n\nI stared daggers through him. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as \u2018too many\u2019 in this case, boy. People died to write these rules, and they\u2019ll save your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all due respect: how, exactly, are these supposed to protect me? Like\u2026 how is clapping and throwing salt around supposed to ward off *anything*? It\u2019s complete nonsense!\u201d\n\nWe got a lot of these types of guys: the \u201crational skeptics\u201d who don\u2019t believe in your silly rules. It\u2019s either that or the fools with more muscle than brains who think they can kill a creature who can make your heart pop with a single thought. Usually, they get filtered out and fired quick. Usually. I made a mental note to beat the ass of whoever decided that this smarmy, cocksure rookie was ready for the graveyard shift. But it was too late to send him home; he wouldn\u2019t make it out of the park alive, if he tried to traipse off through the woods at this hour.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to make sense. These things don\u2019t work by our logic.\u201d But I knew I couldn\u2019t convince these types with words alone, so I stood. \u201cC\u2019mere, boy. Let me show you something.\u201d\n\nI led him to the huge window pane on the cabin\u2019s wall, overlooking the forest down below, and checked my watch - only 20 minutes til the show started. It was a pain convincing him to shut up and wait, but that big mouth of his snapped closed the instant he realized something was emerging from the bushes down there.\n\nIt was a raccoon - not an unusual sight out here, if not for the fact that it was walking upright. And not the clumsy waddling on hind legs you expect from animals, but it seemed to stroll bipedally with all the grace of a man, as if its body had been unnaturally twisted and deformed to befit a style of movement that was never meant for it. It moved with purpose, crab walking across a mossy field with its upper body rigid as a statue\u2019s would be, one \u2018arm\u2019 pointing towards the sky and the other to the ground below. It plodded along its set route for a minute before disappearing back into the shrubbery without ceremony.\n\nHe was baffled, slack-jawed. \u201cWhat the hell was *that*?\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly what it looked like,\u201d I told him. \u201cIf you\u2019re lookin\u2019 for a logical explanation, there ain\u2019t any. Some places on earth, they aren\u2019t run by our logic. They\u2019ve got a different basis for their rules entirely.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSymbolism,\u201d I replied, as if it were obvious. \u201cIn our world, everything\u2019s got to follow the laws of cause-and-effect. For what you\u2019ve seen to have happened, two raccoons must\u2019ve fucked at some point to birth the one we saw. Then somebody, probably me, would\u2019ve had to surgically or genetically mutilate it in ways beyond current medical science, tame and train the wretched thing, and set it up to perform this exact routine at this exact time\u2026 and all for what? To mildly confuse a rookie ranger? Explaining it would require so much contrivance, so much pulling assumptions out your ass, that it would laugh in the face of Occam\u2019s razor. For our logic, it is unexplainable. Impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut symbolically, it made perfect sense. That creature don\u2019t need a backstory or a cause - it prolly just came into existence a few minutes ago, and will pop out of existence once it\u2019s sent its message. Its gesture was the hermetic mantra \u2018as above, so below\u2019 - reminding us that everything that everything that happens on the surface world is mirrored in the underworld. It happens every morning at 1:33 AM because that\u2019s the exact time the Witch of Woodbridge killed \u2018erself to become the intermediary between the two here in Shenandoah. And it\u2019s a raccoon because...\u201d I paused. \u201cWell, actually, I haven\u2019t really figured that part out yet.\u201d\n\nMy words failed to comfort him. In fact, the more I spoke, the more horrified he seemed, eyes widening in confusion and horror as if I\u2019d just sat down and told him that the voices in my head command me to lick the dandruff off of camels. \u201cOh my God. You\u2019re crazy. You\u2019re actually insane.\u201d\n\nI sighed and rolled my eyes. \u201cTell ya what. Think of, for an example you\u2019d be familiar with, a voodoo doll. You use a strand of their hair or a toenail or something so that the doll comes to symbolize their physical vessel. By hurting the doll, you\u2019re symbolically hurting their actual body, so the damage happens to both. That\u2019s how the supernatural works.\u201d\n\nHe blinked. \u201cVoodoo dolls work?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn places like this, they do.\u201d I raised a brow. \u201cDoes that surprise you?\u201d\n\nSuddenly, he stood and threw up his hands, as if realizing he\u2019d been made the victim of some sick prank. \u201cYou know what? Screw this. I don\u2019t know if this is some kind of hazing thing or what, but I feel like continuing this line of conversation would just leave me as batty as you are.\u201d\n\nMy heart lurched with terror as he stomped to the front door and began undoing the numerous slide locks and dead bolts. \u201cWait! Hell are you thinkin\u2019, boy?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d only barely opened the door a crack before I\u2019d wrapped him in a chokehold, but it\u2019d been enough. He let out a startled yelp as I started violently pulling him across the cabin, practically clobbering him just to keep him from wrestling out of my grip. I was no spring chicken, and the younger man probably could have bested me, but I had the element of surprise on my side, plus a blow to the head that had left him drowsy.\n\nI tossed him headlong through a hatch, down into a crawlspace under the cabin where sage burners and dried tobacco and protective talismans were waiting. I slammed the hatch shut behind him, restraining the squirming rookie with my weight and clapping a hand over his mouth to silence his protests. His face was twisted by confusion and rage, and he was just about to throw me off of him, but then he froze\u2026 eyes widening, as we both heard the unmistakable sound of\u2026 *something* walking in through the ajar cabin door.\n\nWe\u2019d made it into the crawlspace just in the nick of time.\n\nThere was the heavy click-clack of hooves against the wood floor above us, interspersed with quieter thuds. It took him a moment, but I could tell when he\u2019d figured it out. With one pair of legs, the creature walked with normal hooves\u2026 with the other, it walked on the knuckles of human hands. And as it stalked the house, knocking over plates and bookshelves, it growled and hissed and groaned not out of one maw, but three: one sounding high and avian, one low and reptilian, and another letting out the soft bleating of a sheep, all in unison like some unholy choir.\n\nJust when it seemed like it couldn\u2019t get any worse, a fourth maw must\u2019ve opened up, for a new sound filled the room \u201cDaddy?\u201d Came a little boy\u2019s voice, desperate and whimpered, sniffling in a way that made me feel sorry for it even despite knowing better. \u201cWhy did you leave me out in the woods, daddy? It was so dark\u2026 and I was so scared. Please, daddy. I thought you loved me. Where are you?\u201d The child\u2019s voice devolved slowly but pitiful begging to outright sobbing and inconsolable weeping, downright screaming itself hoarse as the clock neared 2 and the creature\u2019s searching grew frantic.\n\nBut the very instant the clock struck 2 o\u2019clock, all the sounds ceased, all at once. We waited there for a moment, in that deafening silence\u2026 until I smacked the rookie across the back of the head. \u201cRule 11, you smug prick. You never open the door at this hour of the night. That\u2026 *thing* takes it as an invitation.\u201d My voice made it obvious I was desperately holding back my simmering fury. I\u2019ve beaten folks half to death before, and I\u2019m not afraid to do it again.  \u201cIf you want to get yourself killed tonight, have at it. But I am *not* letting you take me down with you.\u201d\n\nOnce the nightmare had left, his brain had an opportunity to register what had just happened\u2026 which quickly escalated into a full-bore panic attack. \u201cFuck this, man. What in the hell was that!? Oh God, oh God, oh God, I can\u2019t take this man, no, no, no, I\u2019m not cut out for this, I need to go home, I need to, I can\u2019t-\u201c\n\nI watched nervously as he jumped up and started frantically pacing the cabin. He was acting erratically, sloppily. This couldn\u2019t end well. \u201cSnap out of it, boy! No sense in braving the woods this late at night. Ya won\u2019t be able to see more than a foot in front of your face. Just wait here until sun-\u201c\n\nHe swung at me when I tried to restrain him again, almost breaking my nose. \u201cNo, man! I can\u2019t take an entire night of this! I need to go! Jesus, let me go, you crazy bastard!\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t want to admit it, but this one was looking like a lost cause. There was no way I\u2019d be able to overpower him again once he inevitably did something else stupid. Call me selfish, but at this point, my only concern was making sure he didn\u2019t get *me* killed.\n\n\u201cAlright! God, fine! If it\u2019s really so important to ya\u2026 you can go. Your shift\u2019s officially over, rookie. But I ain\u2019t goin\u2019 out there with ya. You\u2019ll have to brave it on yer own. As long as you *follow the rules*, you should be able to make it back to your car in one piece. You hear me? *The rules*!\u201d\n\nHe pouted like a child being lectured by an overbearing father. \u201cYeah, yeah, Christ, old man, I get it! I\u2019ll follow the damn rules!\u201d\n\nIn my defense, I did furnish him with every single thing he\u2019d need to survive out there. UV flashlights, salt boxes, obsidian talismans, volcanic ash, the dried and shrunken head of a lamb, and more\u2026 not that he appreciated any of it. He was just whining at me to hurry up, ignoring all my attempts to remind him of the rules, like he was in a rush to get out there and die horribly. Eventually, I just gave up, shrugged, and let him hike off into that pitch blackness.\n\nTo his credit, he made it farther than I\u2019d expected. Twenty minutes of silence passed, and I started to wonder if he\u2019d actually pulled it off after all.\n\nThat was about when the screaming started.\n\nI\u2019d heard it too many times before: the distinctive wailing of a man realizing everything he\u2019d done and accomplished in his life had all just been leading up to this moment when a shambling abomination saw fit to deliver him to the afterlife kicking and screaming and missing a few body parts. It didn\u2019t surprise me in the slightest, really, but it was still unpleasant to listen to. \n\nJudging from what little of it was intelligible, he was crying about something pulling out his eyes. Must\u2019ve broken rule 13. Poor, stupid bastard. That one\u2019s so easy, you\u2019d almost have to be breaking it on purpose.\n\nI remember the first time somebody broke a rule and got themselves killed under my watch. It almost broke me. I blamed it all on myself, then. Sent me into a depression for months. But now, after all these decades\u2026 I\u2019m just numb.\n\nAfter all, my only job is to write the rules.\n\nIf they don\u2019t want to follow them, well\u2026 it\u2019s their funeral.",

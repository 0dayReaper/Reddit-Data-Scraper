    "postText": " Two whole years ago my wife Angie and I decided it was finally time to buy a house. We knew it was anything but a buyer\u2019s market, but we were sick of paying triple what a mortgage would be in rent every month.\n\nI\u2019m sure this story is familiar to some of you and we went through every stage of disbelief, anger and finally apathy after every competitive offer we put together was blown out of the water by a multinational investment corporation. \n\nI\u2019m not mad about the process anymore although it left me questioning where society was headed. \n\nHOW IS THIS LEGAL!! I WENT TO SCHOOL. I PAID OFF DEBT. I GOT A GOOD JOB. I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT TO STILL GET PRICED OUT THE FUCKING CITY I GREW UP IN!!! \n\nPerhaps some anger remains. But after setting our sights on the city\u2019s less desirable neighborhoods we finally got our home. \n\nOn June 1st we moved into a 4,500 square foot colonial. \n\nIt had hardwood floors that patinated like leather and the frosted plaster trim gave the ceilings the look of a wedding cake. The basement was a different story. It wasn\u2019t just unfinished; it was a dank hole in the ground and scribbled on the walls were strange spirals and crude faces.\n\n\u201cKids.\u201d The realtor had said like she knew who drew the markings. \u201cFixing up the basement would be quite the value builder!\u201d \n\nSo, sure, the kitchen had composite counters and the basement needed a sign above the entrance that read, \u201cAbandon all hope ye who enter here\u201d but we had a home. And a damn big one at that.\n\nThe catch was that it was a stone\u2019s throw from the freeway and that the area was known for its crime more than anything else. Angie said it was just a steppingstone, we\u2019d bank a year\u2019s worth of mortgage, hope the housing market keeps rocketing and move again in a year. \n\nThere were some flaws in her plan, mainly money, but I didn\u2019t say anything. I figured we\u2019d both adjust to like it there. \n\nThe first few weeks went smooth and me and the wife got to unpacking and introducing ourselves to the neighbors. Maybe it was the threat of crime and that there was comfort and purpose in knowing who you lived next to, but whatever it was our neighbors were incredibly friendly. \n\nWe felt at home quick and while there were some shocks, we made games out of them to take the fear away. \n\nWith the pops that permeated the night we had the game where we guessed whether the sound was fireworks or gunshots. When we passed large turds one of us would point and we played \n\nhuman or dog. \n\nUnfortunately, after just a couple weeks at this game we became experts at differentiating between these. Gunshots carry the sharp crack of the sound barrier being broken while fireworks go boom or pop. As for the poop let\u2019s just say that we hadn\u2019t seen any dogs large enough to lay landmines around town.\n\nThere was a homeless problem there for sure, but they minded their own business. Our neighbors seemed to see right through them. They\u2019d act as if they were ghosts. Like they weren\u2019t even there. Hell, everyone did. \n\nI\u2019d smile and say hello in passing. The least I could do was treat them like human beings.\n\nOne night after a movie I was at the sink washing the popcorn bowl. The window above looks out to our backyard which was heavily wooded for a city lot. When it was dark out, I could only see a sliver of what was outside beyond the reflection of myself in the glass. \n\nI frowned at the shadow of a tall dark stump. I don\u2019t remember a tree there. I swayed on my feet to see past my reflection. \n\nIn between the bushes, nearly out of sight, a man was standing still, staring back at me. My heart leaped and I dropped the bowl where it crashed in the sink. \n\n\u201cYou okay in there, honey?\u201d Angie shouted from the living room. \n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d I kept my eyes on the man and said nothing to Angie not wanting to alarm her. \u201cI\u2019m gonna take the trash out.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk.\u201d \n\nI walked by the trash without touching it and opened the back door. \n\n\u201cHello?\u201d Outside the wind was blowing hard and the branches of the buckthorn the man stood behind were waving wildly as if to warn me.  \n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I stepped forward to try and show I wasn\u2019t scared but it was the tepid step of prey like I was better planting my weight to run.\n\nThe man said nothing.\n\nI took another step forward more confidently this time but jumped when my movement activated the motion light. \n\nI composed myself and yelled. \u201cThis is private property! If you don\u2019t leave I\u2019m calling the police!\u201d \n\nNow this was the emptiest of threats and everybody in the neighborhood knew it. The cops made a point to show up an hour late if at all. \n\nThe man walked forward a few paces to where I could see him better. He was very tall and wore a heavy wool overcoat that stretched all the way to his ankles.  \n\nHe kept walking towards me, my brain was shouting but I froze in fear.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\nHe stopped just in front of me. A white scar starred across his black skin just below the chin. He was at least six-foot-six but the coat that ran the entire length of his body made him gigantic. His face was recently shaven and gaunt.\n\nHe held out his fist at arm\u2019s length and when he uncurled his fingers, cupped in his enormous palm was a pill.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any drugs.\u201d I said.\n\nHis face didn\u2019t change any. There was no want or question in his eyes. \n\n\u201cYou want me to take it?\u201d I pointed at his hand but still his expression was static.\n\nI reached out and gently plucked the pill from his palm. I held it between my forefinger and thumb. It was just a pill capsule, whatever had been inside had been emptied.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I asked again.\n\nHe opened his mouth revealing the severed stump of a tongue and then he widened the enormous whites of his eyes. He began to mouth something but being tongueless I couldn\u2019t tell what. But my blood cooled because I felt certain it was some kind of curse.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d I murmured. \u201cPlease leave.\u201d\n\nHe turned and stepped into the night and I watched the bushes sway in his wake as if he were a giant parting his way through the woods. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe next day was Saturday and I was determined to find out if anyone knew about this tall man. I walked to the strip mall and asked some of the homeless in the area, but as soon as I began to describe him, they all looked at the ground and shook their heads. \n\nThe pattern was repeated with every other homeless person I tried to talk to. On my way home, I stopped by two men working on a car at the end of a driveway.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d I started over to them. \u201cThis may sound a little crazy, but do you know of a tall fella around here that wears a giant coat?\u201d They both started laughing. \u201cSorry to waste your time.\u201d I turned to go.\n\n\u201cNo, no.\u201d One of them was waving me back. \u201cYou talking about a really big motherfucker?\u201d The man raised his hand to signify. \u201cYay high? Black coat? Nasty scars?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d I nodded.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s Tall Frank. What you wanna about him? You see him in your recycling?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, why?\u201d\n\n\u201cTall Frank\u2019s a can man. He makes his living that way.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cHe was acting weird in my backyard last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cWeird how? Was he just looking like his weird self ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. He was staring at me from outside. When I went out he tried to say something. Or mouth something.\u201d\n\nBoth of their brows rose. \u201cYou saying that Tall Frank tried to communicate with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d \n\nThey both looked at each other. \u201cTall Frank talks to nobody. And by talks I mean\u2026 communicating in any kinda way.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe cut his own throat to never talk again.\u201d The other chimed in. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just a rumor. Tall Frank showed up in this neighborhood twenty years ago. No one knows where he came from and the man can\u2019t tell ya. Yeah, people put all kinds of legend to those scars. Some say it was dog that bit him. But I never seen no dog that\u2019ll slice your tongue out.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t communicate with anyone how come he has the name Tall Frank?\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm. Well that\u2019s what my mama would call him.\u201d He leaned closer to me. \u201cShe used to tell me to watch my tongue or Tall Frank\u2019ll take it!\u201d He chuckled to himself.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think he wanted with me?\u201d\n\nThey both shrugged. \u201cNo clue. But you be sure to tell us when you find out.\u201d \n\nThey bent back to their work and I thanked them and went on far less assured than when I\u2019d first set out.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe next several days there was no sign of Tall Frank, but I began to fall ill. It was a headache at first, but soon I had heart palpitations and body aches that I almost let take me to the emergency room. \n\nI assured myself that there was no such thing as curses. Why was I letting one strange encounter with a homeless man dominate my every thought? Angie was working late recently and when I had the house to myself at night, I would stand at the kitchen window and stare into the backyard. \n\nI was obsessed and it wasn\u2019t long before I saw him again. I was wrapped in a blanket filling the teapot at the sink when I saw him standing in the same place as before.\n\nI dropped the pot and ran to the back door. \n\n\u201cHey!\u201d My head felt light and I was in that same kind of drunken state where your fear hardly speaks to you. I scampered through the backyard over to him. \u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d\n\nTall Frank was staring at me. He gestured with his scarred neck for me to follow. \n\nI looked down at my bare feet, but he was already walking. \n\n\u201cHey! Just leave us alone!\u201d \n\nI stepped cautiously after him. When I got past the bushes where I could see the alley I saw him standing near the trashcans.\n\nI ran after him. \u201cYou! I don\u2019t ever want to see you back here again!\u201d With our difference in size and the blanket wrapped around my shoulders I\u2019m sure I looked to him like some angry hobbit. \n\nHe certainly didn\u2019t act intimated and I can\u2019t blame him. Tall Frank crossed the alley and sat on a crumbling retaining wall. He gently tapped the stone next to him for me to sit. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not fucking sitting.\u201d\n\nHe reached into his breast pocket and paused before pulling out an envelope. Then he put the letter in his other hand and reached in again and pulled out another. \n\n\u201cWhat are those?\u201d\n\nHe extended the envelopes to me, his long arm nearly stretched the entire alley. I approached the letters cautiously snatching them and stepping back. \n\n\u201cWhat are these?\u201d I muttered already distracted. They had both been opened and I took the papers out of one of the envelopes.\n\nIt was a handwritten letter on college ruled paper. All the ink was smeared like it\u2019d been dunked in water, but I could still read it albeit slowly. When I was done reading, I let my arm fall down to my side and stared at Tall Frank in disbelief. \n\nAngie had a lover. \n\nI looked at the other envelope and hardly had to read it to figure it out.\n\nThe letterhead read: Atlantic Life Insurance. \n\nA policy had been opened in my name for a quarter of a million dollars. \n\nI stumbled over to the retaining wall and sat. \n\n\u201cThe pills.\u201d I thought about the empty capsule he\u2019d shown me that I tossed aside. It was my emergency Albuterol. It had to be. A quick WebMD search showed that an overdose started with symptoms of headaches and heart palpations. \n\n\u201cAngie is trying to kill me?\u201d\n\nSuddenly I realized Tall Frank\u2019s arm was around me and he was patting my shoulder paternally. \n\nWe sat there in silence for a long time. \n\n\u201cThe things you can learn from people\u2019s recycling.\u201d I said.\n\nTall Frank nodded and we watched the upstairs light turn on and my wife appeared in the window. She twisted something in her fingers and then tapped it into a mug.\n\nA minute later I heard the back door open. \n\n\u201cHoney are you out here?\u201d Angie called. \u201cI made you some tea!\u201d\n\nI guess the homeless around her don\u2019t always want change. Sometimes they might want to [save your life.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thespookyplace/)",

In the city I currently live in, I have seen quite a few unhoused people picking up litter or literally sweeping the sidewalk - and I've checked, there's no city program to pay them for this (there should be), they're just doing it to contribute to their community. We could all do with some more empathy - who knows, maybe it'll even be rewarded at some point like it was for you.",

Next thing I know I feel 6 hands on my shoulders and arms and then I get pulled back, the homeless group had come over to help me!! They got him out of my car and I checked that everything was there, they helped me explain everything to the police (they saw the commotion while driving by) and I decided not to press charges on the dude cause I just felt bad, the poor dude had full opportunity to drive away (I left the car running) but he didn\u2019t so I just felt like he wanted to find something for drugs or feel the cool air even, but OH MY FUCKKNG GODS am I thankful for those homeless people helping \ud83d\ude2b\u2764\ufe0f",

Not sure if I had the heart to jump but I had remembered my great-grand aunt telling my Mom she walked that bridge and considered jumping more times than she cared to recall after she lost her little girl to the Spanish Flu circa 1919, I believe. Anyway. I was a city employee, firefighter and we had to live in the city. Loved the city. Never had issues with homeless people and still do not, many large cities later. A man walked out of the fog. He asked me if he could walk with me. I said sure. I ended up getting coffee and food for him( I don\u2019t even think he intended that for himself, just knew I needed to eat) The man was probably my age now. How the hell he walked so long after walking all day being homeless I will never know. I remember about an hour after I said Goodnight to Dwight G., I had radio listening to best of Elton John. \u201cSomeone Saved My Life Tonight\u201d, came on and I burst into tears.

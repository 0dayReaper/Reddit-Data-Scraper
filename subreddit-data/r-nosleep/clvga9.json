    "postText": "Last time: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ckw07c/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app\n\nI sat silent for a moment in shock that my plan had even worked. It seemed almost too simple, too easy. But here he was.\n\nDerek had a kindly face, wrinkles around his eyes and cheeks only added to the softness of his expression. His white hair poking out from beneath his flat cap stood out in the dark night.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lovely little patch you\u2019ve planted. I can look after it if you like, I used to maintain the last garden here.\u201d He said, breaking the silence that had followed since his initial words. \n\n\u201cI know who you are. We need you.\u201d Was all I could manage, the mental exhaustion and fatigue from the whole experience had built up, but his arrival was like finishing a bad day working at school. I felt like I could relax again, even if only a little. \n\n\u201cWhats your name darling?\u201d He asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Kat. I live in flat 42 now.\u201d His face lit up as I confirmed my flat number. \n\n\u201cPrudence has gone?\u201d He asked.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s gone. But the whole place is a mess, so many things are happening and the residents are suffering.\u201d I answered. \n\nWe chatted for what felt like hours. Outside with nothing but moonlight. He told me how he used to consider the building part of the garden, a place for him to maintain, the residents just like the plants he looks after. \n\nI explained my whole experience since moving in. I told him about Jamie and I sobbed. Derek held me as I cried and made me feel safe, something I had forgotten the feeling of since receiving Prue\u2019s note. He didn\u2019t interrupt, he just listened.\n\nI told him about Natalia and the cultists, the problems they had been causing. He was particularly heartbroken when he heard that they had used Eddie and Ellie for entry. He had gone before they were born, but remembered Terri as a child and how sweet she was, he was pleased when I told her what a sweet adult she had become. \n\nMy claims that Prudence was the only person who knew how to kill the imposter neighbours were met with a skeptical expression which gave me some hope.\n\nDerek listened to my entire tale with barely a word. When I finished he stood up and asked me to follow him. I was confused, but I did as I was told. \n\nHe walked me to the entrance of the lift. I lifted my arm to check the time on my watch. We had been outside for quite some time and the idea of the creatures being inside made my heart pound and my stomach turn. \n\n\u201cYou are safe. It\u2019s 12.32am, there\u2019s no need to worry or to check your watch.\u201d And with that he pressed the \u201ccall lift\u201d button. Despite his insistence that I was safe my stomach continued to do gymnastics.\n\nIt felt like forever before the lift finally made the clunking sound that meant it had reached the bottom. I felt my whole body shaking violently as the doors opened, I don\u2019t know what I expected to see, we were in the safe time zone but every time I looked at the life I pictured Jamie\u2019s dead, crunched up body. \n\n\u201cStep inside.\u201d He said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t. Please don\u2019t make me.\u201d I begged\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to you. But you need to see something.\u201d There was such sincerity in his eyes as he spoke. I had never trusted someone so completely so quickly, but every fibre of my being told me this man was entirely good. \n\nI stepped inside the lift.\n\nDerek stepped in behind me, placing a comforting hand on my shoulder as I hyperventilated. He gently turned me to face the panel of buttons that control where the lift stops.\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong with this panel? Do you see it?\u201d He asked cryptically. \n\nI studied the panel. Read all the numbers, counting them. I couldn\u2019t see anything wrong. I tried. I really tried, but nothing seemed out of place at all. Everything you expected to find was there and nothing more. I shook my head, barely regaining my composure.\n\n\u201cCan you take us to floor 9 please?\u201d He smiled slightly as he made the request. \n\nI looked back to the panel to press the button, but floor 9 didn\u2019t exist. I was so confused, I had counted the numbers, I was sure of it. Derek must have made it disappear. But the panel didn\u2019t look any different to before. I can\u2019t explain it, looking at it, I would have sworn blind nothing was wrong with it even once I knew, but floor 9 didn\u2019t exist. Derek could see my frustration. It was like the building was now playing tricks on me. \n\nHe walked me out of the lift and sat me down on the bottom of the stairs before he finally began to speak.\n\n\u201cThe building is like a living organism. It can seal off parts of the world, and it can open up others you never could have imagined. When those awful people burned that whole floor of residents I was devastated.\n\n\u201cSome wonderful people lived in those flats, both of the usual and unusual variety. But those people had no limit to their cruelty. Whole families burned alive, it was a tragedy that made me so angry. \n\n\u201cI felt so guilty when it happened. I can predict what some of our more tricky residents are going to do and make sure I\u2019m there to help. But those people were nothing to do with this place. I couldn\u2019t see what they were planning, so I couldn\u2019t stop it.\u201d\n\nAt this point I noticed one of the hairless cats had sat between us, Derek looked at it with tears brimming in his eyes, he stroked it and it moved on to his lap. Dereks fingers didn\u2019t burn at all. He continued.\n\n\u201cWhen it happened the building used its defence mechanisms and sealed off the entirety of the floor. It stopped the fire from spreading and kept the perpetrators there, to die by their own hands.\n\n\u201cThe building only allowed the floor to be unsealed once they were dead. \n\n\u201cIt took about a week before those awful people turned up again. Asking for sugar at people\u2019s doors, the first few let them in. It was so difficult, so many residents burned alive that I was having to use their remains for my garden just to hide the dead. The entire community were terrified and grieving for those that died. \n\n\u201cNo matter how hard I tried I still couldn\u2019t predict them, or see them, so I took Prudence, who at the time seemed a perfectly reasonable woman, to the burned out floor.\n\n\u201cFloor 9, however, had been sealed again. There was no button in the lift, and it always skipped on the stairs. Only no one had noticed. This building really is a magnificent creature.\u201d\n\nI stared at him in amazement through the whole story, I was exhausted but my brain was working in overdrive to process what he was telling me. I had started to stroke the cat too, my fingers did burn, but I didn\u2019t flinch, I found it\u2019s company comforting. He carried on. \n\n\u201cI went back later that night and took the stairs again, alone this time. I think my intentions were clear and the stairs allowed me access to floor 9 for the first time since just after the fire. \n\n\u201cI bought Prudence to the floor within the hour. The stairs had stopped skipping floor 9 for me, although I later learned that when Prudence had tried alone she was not allowed access.\n\n\u201cWe explored the floor, walking amongst the remnants of our dead friends belongings. Eventually, we came across one of the soulless arsonists, roaming the halls. It appears that\u2019s where they spend their time when they aren\u2019t out terrorising the residents trying to claim more victims. \n\n\u201cHe was disturbed and disoriented to see anyone not like them on that floor. He twitched a little and spat out the sugar line as if it was an automatic response, I almost felt sorry for him. He claimed to come from flat 66. More were approaching behind him. \n\n\u201cPrudence was terrified, she was starting to sweat profusely and back away from the man, but it didn\u2019t cool her down, he was burning her slowly. I felt nothing; See, the stranger things in life just don\u2019t seem to affect me, I\u2019ve never known why. Sometimes I even just know how to deal with them, like it\u2019s programmed into me. On this new playing field, in their domain. I knew what to do. \n\n\u201cI grabbed the man and ran him down to flat 66, 4 doors from where we were standing. I threw him into the flat and waited. The other arsonists were approaching.\n\n\u201cThe man tried to exit the flat, that was doorless after the wooden doors all burned to cinders in the fire. But as he reached to door something stopped him. He couldn\u2019t leave, no matter how hard he tried, or how much he screamed. \n\n\u201cPrudence lit up, she grabbed hold of one that had tried to kill her friend, Molly. She remembered the flat number she had claimed to be from and repeated my actions, with a lot more sweating and some winces of pain. It worked again. \n\n\u201cPrudence wanted to go after the rest, but as they got closer I could see the blisters forming on parts of her body, I dragged her out of the hallway and back into the stairwell. We ran. \n\n\u201cShe begged me to take her back, kept telling me that the stairs wouldn\u2019t let her, that it was too dangerous. The residents had started to learn not to let them in and we had no casualties at all after we trapped the first two. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a problem I was intending to deal with, but it was around that time that we first learned the council would be building that monstrosity over the top of my garden.\u201d He gestured to the window that just showed some of the neighbouring tower block.\n\n\u201cThis left me not at my best, my intuition was failing me when a few months after that, I allowed Prudence and Molly to heard the creatures from the lift to floor 9. It\u2019s one of my biggest regrets. I should never have walked them up there. But I didn\u2019t know she was going to burn them all. She didn\u2019t give me a chance to reason. \n\n\u201cI became mistrusting of everyone and distracted. Not long after I went away for a long while. So I guess the arsonists remained and now they\u2019re threatening you.\n\n\u201cTomorrow I will go. I will fix the mess I left behind. I am so sorry it\u2019s affected you so badly, I\u2019d love to meet these twins. They sound incredibly brave.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are.\u201d I finally interrupted, \u201cAnd I want to be there tomorrow. I want to lock Natalia away for good.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t allow it. You\u2019ll be attacked.\u201d He cut me off entirely. I let it drop instantly but in the back of my mind I knew I would be there, no matter what. \n\nI went to sleep that night with my mind reeling. I wondered where Derek slept and if he even needed to. \n\nThe next morning I left my flat early, passed the man on floor 5, and sat at waited on the steps at floor 8. I tested it of course, and just like anticipated, ascending any higher took me straight to floor 10. Or 11 depending on if you hit a skip. So I returned to floor 8, and I waited.\n\nDerek hadn\u2019t indicated what time he was coming. But I was ready. I would wait all day and night if I had to. But luckily I didn\u2019t.\n\nDerek was climbing the stairs at around 11am, I had already been there for 3 hours but it had been worth it. He looked particularly unimpressed to see me. His face still looked kind though, even with the sour expression. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stop you can I?\u201d He sighed, sounding resigned in his tone. \n\n\u201cNot for anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to promise to stay back. If you get your girl approaches you can do what you need to do, but you have to stay back.\u201d He pleaded.\n\nI nodded and stood up. We ascended the stairs and for the very first time in my new life here I saw the big plastic sign saying 9. The floor that didn\u2019t exist. \n\nAs we pushed through the door it was like entering an entirely new world. Everything was black. Burned to carbon. You could smell nothing but charcoal. Literally nothing but empty shells of homes and flakes of what used to be sentimental objects remained. It was devastating to witness. \n\nIf you\u2019ve ever visited a mass grave site you\u2019ll understand partly how I was feeling. It was sickening, to think of all the lives needlessly lost. But I didn\u2019t get time to think.\n\nNatalia walked towards me. Flying down the hallway. \n\n\u201cHow the fuck did you get here?!\u201d She screamed. Her eyes were wide and angry, I started to feel hotter already. \n\nDerek grabbed my arm and pulled me next to him. Making sure to keep a tight hold of my arm. \n\n\u201cWhere do you live?\u201d Derek asked her, I started to back away as the sweat dropped from my brow. I desperately wanted to shout out the number, but I couldn\u2019t. I was so hot, I wasn\u2019t functioning properly, everything became so overwhelming I couldn\u2019t remember what Georgia had said, what flat Natalia had claimed to come from.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that stupid. I saw what happened to them.\u201d She gestured over her shoulder to what must have been flat number 66, where a man laid on the floor, breathing but looking broken. Just existing in that room. Prudence had been creative with the truth yet again. She didn\u2019t kill them, you can\u2019t kill them. \n\nWhat had Georgia said? I racked my brains as I felt the skin on my face start to sting. I imagined her melting away, it was happening to me. I was next. \n\nAnd then, as my hair started to singe at the ends, it came to me. \n\n\u201c71!\u201d I screamed as loud as I could. I could barely see as Derek grabbed her and ran towards me with her. She was clawing at his eyes and face screaming at him to let go. But he didn\u2019t burn. He just kept hold of her. When he approached flat 71 he beckoned me over. \n\n\u201cYou do it. Then get off of this floor.\u201d He was blunt but reasonable, I complied. \n\nI pushed hard. There was nothing but anger in her eyes, she pushed my face hard with her hand as I got her to cross the boundary into flat 71. I felt my skin sizzle and blister. My whole face was in agony, but I didn\u2019t stop pushing.\n\nWatching Natalia try to fight her way out of a door that didn\u2019t exist was both satisfying and humorous. The others had started to approach at the sound of the commotion. I lingered, hoping to watch her suffer but derek shot me one look and I knew. It was time to go, \n\nI ran out the corridor and back into the stairwell. I stopped for longer than I probably should have. But I knew I might not get to see that 9 again and it would be worth it. I waited for Derek on floor 9s stairwell. I couldn\u2019t help but imagine the cultists burning to death the first time around. \n\nI could hear angry screams faintly from inside the corridor, they made me worry about Derek but I knew that really I didn\u2019t need to. It took a while, but he eventually left the corridor and joined me in the stairwell. \n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything, he just looked at me and the third degree burns across my face. He didn\u2019t need to speak, I knew he\u2019d fixed the problem. \n\nWe walked silently back down the stairs towards my flat. I looked back up at floor 9, knowing the building would seal it off for good. It took a few floors to reach floor 7 and I invited Derek in for a cup of tea. He rejected it, saying he wanted to go visit some old friends.\n\nDespite my injuries I couldn\u2019t help but smile, something I\u2019d done was going to help these residents. I stood at my door and watched Derek walk away, pleased that there was some true good in this building. \n\nAfter a few steps down the hallway, Derek started to fade, almost like a cgi ghost in a movie, every step he became more transparent. I felt my stomach turn again, like it had outside the lift. I ran out to follow him. I called after him but by the time I had reached where he\u2019d been he was gone. I walked the entire corridor to the window at the back. I looked out the window into the small concrete heavy garden and hoped to see him sat on the memorial bench.\n\nI didn\u2019t see him, instead I saw Prudence. Hacking at my tiny planted patch with shears.\n\nHow it ends: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cmykhy/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app",

If all the other residents you've spoken to harbour some mistrust for her, I think it's safe to say she has her own agenda and isn't doing you any favours. \n\nI'm surprised she's back at the building though. How did she know you made a new garden? Perhaps her return with incite something dreadful. Or maybe she's more deeply connected to the building than she's letting on.\n\nOther than the issue of Prudence, I think you should investigate this mysterious man on the staircase. Does anyone know what happened to him? Who he is?\n\nAlso it's very good to hear that Natalia is trapped on floor 9. I hope Derek did manage to lock up the rest of them. One of them could've been wandering the building at the time. Keep your wits about you. Now is not the time to let your guard down",

Her poor boyfriend is gone, she has revenge on the cultists, why else is she staying? She is no hero, as she said. The most I'd do is make all neighbors work on a large, fenced garden. By the time Prudence starts destroying it, they'd find out.\n\nSpeaking of Prudence, I really want to know her motives. I heavily dislike her from calling the OP spoiled after she lost her boyfriend. Although it's true that the OP and her bf might not believe them. But there is no use in being secretive. I thought she was sorry about ruining Derek's garden, but here she is hacking away. Still, deep down I feel like she isn't malicious. Although idk, this story could go anyway.",

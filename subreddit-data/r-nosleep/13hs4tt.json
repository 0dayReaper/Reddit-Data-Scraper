    "postText": "I\u2019m not talking about childbirth. Something awful is growing within me.\n\nI\u2019m a 29-year-old woman named Nancy, and this is my first pregnancy. There was nothing abnormal about our baby\u2019s conception. I\u2019ve lived a normal, middle-class, suburban life. No Satanic rituals. No cults. Nothing that Hollywood films often imply to be the culprit. I suppose I\u2019d better explain why I\u2019m going to die.\n\n***12 weeks:***\n\nEverybody uses the clich\u00e9 that pregnancy is \u201cno walk in the park\u201d, but I knew my symptoms were unusual at the very first ultrasound scan. My husband, Johnny, came with me, and I don\u2019t think anything could\u2019ve prepared us.\n\nThe baby, much to our horror, had long, spindly arms and legs. And the worst part was the look on Dr Samson\u2019s face. She was *smiling*. There was something uncanny about her skin. It seemed oversized and loose-fitting, though that was certainly enough to tauten my *heart*. If she\u2019d looked ordinary, I might\u2019ve dismissed her jolly reaction as an attempt to put us at ease.\n\n\u201cIs that... normal?\u201d Johnny asked.\n\n\u201cEvery baby is special,\u201d The doctor answered, chuckling.\n\nThen she leant over my belly, inaudibly mouthing something to the baby. I cast wide eyes at my husband, silently begging for him to save me. Johnny opened his mouth, but the doctor lifted her head before he could speak.\n\n\u201cPerfectly healthy and happy,\u201d She said.\n\nDr Samson\u2019s smiling face followed us as we walked out of the room. We chalked it up to a weird experience \u2013 a weird screen glitch, a weird doctor, and a weird day.\n\nI wish I\u2019d trusted my fearful instincts.\n\n***21 weeks:***\n\nMy husband and I hoped for a slightly more normal picture from my second scan, but Dr Samson showed us something even more unnerving. The baby seemed too well-formed for 20 weeks. I suddenly realised my late-night cramps and pains hadn\u2019t been normal at all. The grinding, tearing sensation in my lower abdomen must've been those ghastly, elongated limbs digging away at my innards. I feared the baby would burst my uterus.\n\n\u201cPerfectly healthy,\u201d Dr Samson assured me, offering that same unhinged smile.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with him,\u201d I whimpered, crying.\n\nJohnny started to reassure me that Dr Samson was a professional, though I knew he shared my terror. He wanted to keep me safe and sane. He\u2019s a good man.\n\n\u201cIs there something wrong with the scanner, perhaps?\u201d He asked, *hopefully*.\n\nDr Samson giggled. \u201cNo. It\u2019s perfectly fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I want a second opinion,\u201d I said.\n\nI expected the doctor to refuse, but she persisted with that searing smile. And a few days later, my third scan produced a bizarre result. *Nothing* appeared on the screen.\n\nDr Houghton, my new doctor, sighed sombrely. \u201cIt could be a miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy \u2013 a pregnancy outside of the womb. We\u2019ll need to conduct tests.\u201d\n\nI *knew* I hadn\u2019t miscarried. My pain was worsening with every passing day, but no professionals could ascertain what was happening to me. And Dr Houghton couldn\u2019t attend my fourth scan. Nobody could get in touch with him. So, Dr Brown took over.\n\n\u201cAha! Found your baby! He was just playing hide and seek,\u201d Our new doctor said, laughing.\n\nJohnny and I gasped at the screen in terror. Finally, we could see our baby again. In the space of five days, our son had become *ginormous*. His legs were slinking out of view, and his head was filling up my womb. For a brief moment, Dr Brown rubbed his eyes, and I realised he wasn\u2019t wiping the bags beneath them. Like Dr Samson, his flesh seemed to *loosely cling* to his face. But unlike Dr Samson, he seemed keen to keep us calm.\n\n\u201cHe might look a little large, but he\u2019s healthy,\u201d Dr Brown promised. \u201cPerfectly fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy does everybody keep saying this is *perfectly* fine?\u201d Johnny asked, finally losing his cool. \u201cSomething is wrong, and\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a pregnancy like this before,\u201d Dr Brown interjected, smiling. \u201cI promise you that nothing is wrong with your son. He\u2019s just a fast grower.\u201d\n\n***32 weeks:***\n\nWe went for scans at different hospitals, but nothing showed up on scanners or results. As far as anybody could tell me, I wasn\u2019t pregnant.\n\nOne terrible night, at 3am, I started to think they might be right.\n\nI woke to find myself in a state of sleep paralysis. My lips couldn\u2019t open and my limbs wouldn\u2019t budge, so I wasn\u2019t able to wake Johnny. Beyond my control, however, my grinding, painful limbs *pulled my body out of bed*. I could feel something within my body, like a secondary skeleton, puppeteering my paralysed form towards the en-suite bathroom.\n\nI stood before the mirror, trembling in disbelief at my sagging skin, horrified that the thing might burst free and tear me to shreds. My lips, still firmly pressed together, began to curl upwards.\n\nIt was the same smile that I\u2019d seen on Dr Samson\u2019s face.\n\n***38 weeks:***\n\nWe saw Dr Brown yesterday. A late \u201cemergency scan\u201d revealed something, but we couldn\u2019t even see a baby anymore. Just an indistinguishable mass that filled my womb. It might\u2019ve been part of my baby\u2019s fully-grown torso.\n\n\u201c*Perfectly fine*,\u201d Dr Brown said, smiling horribly.\n\nAs we left the hospital in a dazed state of terror, Johnny and I bumped into Dr Samson, and the deranged doctor gripped my arm, leaning towards me.\n\n\u201cNot long until you walk with us, *Takra*,\u201d She giggled into my ear, presumably speaking to my baby. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll do perfectly fine.\u201d\n\nThis petrifying pregnancy finally makes sense. The relentless aches in my joints. The ever-drooping bags under my eyes. The throbbing sensation in my head \u2013 it feels as if something wants to worm its way in there, pancaking my brain against the inside of my skull. Replacing it with something else.\n\nI\u2019m not going to give birth in 2 weeks, am I? Takra is going to fill my body and wear my skin like a glove.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll become one of the loose-fleshed people.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

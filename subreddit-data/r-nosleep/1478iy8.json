    "postText": "Let me start this out by asking you an important question, have you ever wanted to be a storm chaser? I did, when I was a kid, Twister was my number 1, all-time favorite movie. I knew so much of the dialog between Bill and Helen that I could faithfully recite the scenes line for line.  There is a natural ferocity our planet makes when thunderstorms start rolling in, and when they evolve into supercells you really must marvel at the raw majesty of what they\u2019re capable of.  I know so much more now than I ever wanted to know, and I am being hunted by these storms for what I do know. You heard me right, I\u2019m being hunted by these storms, and I feel the need to share my story with you, as a warning. Don\u2019t go digging too deep into Supercell thunderstorm research and how tornadoes form. The wind is starting to pick up outside, I\u2019ll try to be brief.\n\nI started to dive deep into meteorology as a curious child, in my grade school I\u2019d fish out any books we had on storms, weather, wind, nature, lightning, and especially all those older books with firsthand accounts of experiencing a tornado right on top of them. There are some truly harrowing stories in those books, and I latched onto it like an intellectual lamprey.  Like many kids, it started at surface level stuff, learning about the different types of clouds like Strata, or nimbus, but the big one everyone knows storms for are called \u201cCumulonimbus\u201d clouds. Those are the giant, towering monsters that bring rain and lightning and can form into what are known as \u201cSupercells.\u201d \n\nBy the time I was leaving grade school and going into middle school it was the late 90\u2019s going into the aughts, so internet was becoming ever more prevalent, but not nearly as widespread as we deal with it today, and while social media has it\u2019s upsides one really had to learn how to \u2018search the internet\u2019 it wasn\u2019t just type something into an address bar and Google does all the heavy lifting. You see, this is where things took a turn. All those books in my grade school were factual in nature. They\u2019d explain the basic or slightly more complex facets of weather anatomy, what we thought were the causes of storm formation. Cold and warm fronts meeting, the circular and whirling nature of updrafts pulling more warm air in, you get the idea. Air and moisture into clouds and storms 101 and 201 kind of information. \n\nThe wind is picking up a little more harshly, the old oak outside is starting to creak and clack against the upstairs window. Where was I, right the internet information. I started to find GeoCities and other such sites where I\u2019d learn different things about storms and \u2018wind\u2019 in general. People make all these detailed little pages, with little moving gifs of a palm tree whipping in a constant wind while explaining what they thought was the nature of the various elements. Some would have dedicated pages to fire, or water, but what I sought out was wind. \n\nI stumbled on this page in the wee hours of summer break in 8th grade, not really knowing what I was really getting into. It had a calming little embedded player for music that cooed out softly from my gateway PC speakers, while I scrolled through the text. Something caught my eye near the bottom, the right margin was off set with another one of those whipping palm tree pixelated gifs that were shockingly well animated for the time. I won\u2019t quote it as it\u2019s long-lost to time, but it went into details about natures wrath. How They supposedly had spotted strange green crystals in the wake left from extremely violent tornadoes, think the Joplin F5, or the El Reno F5. The page owner suspected that they first appeared back in 1953 when the first officially ranked F5 hit Waco Texas. \nIt's still early afternoon, why is it getting so dim out, and the wind isn\u2019t letting up. I need to pick up the pace here and get ready to leave. I suspect within a few hours there will be a severe weather warning, followed by a tornado warning on the radio. Damn that oak tree, it\u2019s distracting, trying to claw its way into the house. Right, the crystals. I have some, more than some I have almost a dozen collected now. Turns out that little Yahoo GeoCities page was spot on, and I had no idea what I was getting myself into. \n\nThat little nugget of information stuck with me though the end of high school, the idea of these supernatural crystals left in the ground scouring from extremely strong winds. That isn\u2019t how crystals are formed, yet there was something about the extraordinarily low pressure in the condensation funnel, combined with low temperatures and the extreme winds. It\u2019s sort of like a quartz crystal point. A flat bottom, and a shaft with a single point, sometimes with little branches if it\u2019s a bigger one. They\u2019re an eerie translucent green and pulse when the weather starts to turn. Seeing them on my shelf with my other rocks, you\u2019d not really think of them as anything other than a strange colored ghost quartz, for you rockhounds out there. \n\nIt was 2008 when Parkersburg was hit, it cleared well built homes off their foundations, and the fatalities were somehow in the single digits. You see the cleanup and hear about efforts to rebuild but what the news doesn\u2019t cover is the teams of black vans and men in suits, with other guys in those inflatable pressure suits for handling hazardous materials poking around the damaged areas.  I was old enough to drive by this point, and it was only an hour away from where I was living at the time so with jeans and a blue T-shirt I hopped into my car, and I followed the roads to find the damage path. It was the morning after, the sky was blue and there were only white puffy clouds dotting the horizon Following some unmarked highway, where the tornado intersected, I had to come to a slow crawling stop. I stared ahead of me while the road just\u2026was missing a patch half a mile long. There were trees bent in disorienting shapes, grass in places I didn\u2019t think grass could be put, alongside small pieces of debris from barns it must have picked up earlier. It was there though, the signature swirling windswept \u2018scar\u2019 left on the ground in such detail and magnificent size it could be seen from space, or so they claim. \n\nI saw a few of those black vans headed away from me when I was driving to the point, seemingly paying no mind having finished up whatever investigation they did in this middle of nowhere portion of a large tornado\u2019s damage path. I parked on the shoulder, into the grass and got out. There was an eerie silence, something wasn\u2019t quite right about this area, it felt like a fresh wound still tender and throbbing. The trees, what was left of them creaked ominously at me, as if warning me to tread carefully or be on my way.  It was just\u2026flattened, in both directions I\u2019d look, and my body felt wrong once I put my first foot down onto the pale scarred ground from the extraordinary winds that tore at the surface of the earth just hours earlier.  This felt like an alien church, an old place I had entered, a sort of sacred ground and I was by no means welcome. The tore up ground was firmly packed, there was no cracking or crunching underfoot, and I looked for anything of interest. Spotting a large mass of damage, I headed over to the mangled remains of several trees wrapped into an ornery pointed ball of twisted splintered limbs and saw dust. The mass of tangled wood creaked and groaned in the gentle breeze that lingered, almost like a ghastly remnant of the monster that had howled into the early morning. That\u2019s when I noticed it, a pale green glint buried deep into the ground near the foot of this tangled mess of trees. \n\nI walked closer, transfixed by it, making sure this wasn\u2019t some trick of the light or a piece of sheet metal warped into prismatic colors. I knelt and took a good look at what was buried in the ground and a distinct crystalline point stared up at me like the budding sprout of a tuber willing itself to not yet be picked.  With a will, and a stick I picked up next to me, I started to dig into the ground, ignoring the unsettling chilly gusts of wind that seemed to kick up from nowhere. Fifteen minutes later, and hands muddy and covered in a few splinters I pried my prize from the ground. A glinting, three inch long crystal that had a truly ghastly green transparency and was cold to the touch, not warming as I held it. It clicked in my mind what I read as a budding teenager those handful of years ago in the wee morning hours on that heavy CRT screen. This was one of those phenomenal crystals, they were quite real, and I was about to find out why you don\u2019t go rooting through the scars of the planet looting it like some kind of pirate or thief. \n\nWhen I turned around, I realized something was very wrong, the near constant breeze and little whipping gusts had ceased entirely, and abruptly. Looking up at the blue sky it seemed to dim, the bright white puffy clouds seemed to come to a standstill. It was still mid-morning, but it felt like it was approaching twilight hours.  Looking at the crystalline\u2026thing in my hands I felt another gentle breeze almost caresses my body and up my back, causing me to shudder involuntarily. I nearly let the crystal roll out of my hands but clutched it moments before it slipped of my grasp.\n\nI had enough of this tortured mark on the ground, and decided it was time to go, so with a jogging pace I headed back to my car. Getting in I placed the crystal in the center console of my little 2 door, and got the engine started. It was at this moment what I could only describe as a downdraft smacked my little car square in the center of the roof, causing it to audibly groan as the suspension was depressed. I yelped and about jumped out of my skin, but the buffeting winds only lasted a few seconds. Turning the car around I scooted that little thing up through the gears to get off this old highway, it might\u2019ve been called Bob\u2019s road or something, but it wasn\u2019t any main artery into town.  Looking in my rear view mirror my blood ran cold as I put distance between myself and that pulsing etched mark in the earth. \n\nHave you ever seen a dust devil just meandering on a baseball field in the summer or fall? The slow whirling dusty mass, it could be described as whimsical but not threatening in any real shape or form? Maybe you wanted to run through it and got a mouthful of dust and gravel to spit back out. I saw something like that but larger, dead flat center of the road behind me, growing smaller as I drove away. It hadn\u2019t been there moments before and I could have sworn my eyes must have been playing tricks on me because I\u2019d tell you up and down it had a pair of terrifying, pure white triangular eyes staring out at me. I looked ahead and saw nothing but an open, abandoned highway, and looking back into my review mirror that monstrous column of wind was now gone.\n\nThe sky\u2019s gone dark now, and the wind is howling again. That damn tree is going to break one of those windows open if I don\u2019t do something soon. I\u2019ve got my bug-out bag ready and in the car. It\u2019s only going to be minutes now before those damn sirens start blaring and I need to get a move on. It\u2019s funny where life leads you, my neighbors always ask me why I drive this impractical car, and how I can afford gas. Truth is, a truck would be nice but they don\u2019t make em fast enough off the lot for the money I got to get me to safety. \n\nI tell em I have to outrun the storms, and a few have told me even if I got caught by a tornado they only clock 50MPH if they\u2019re really moving. Thing of it is, the record now is approaching north of 94MPH, and climbing year by year, they\u2019re chasing after me and getting better at it. While my car will do almost double that, I\u2019m not outrunning the wind, I\u2019m trying to avoid what the wind is throwing around. I must leave now, I need to explain what these crystals do, and I must implore you, don\u2019t make the mistake I have. I can\u2019t stay in the same place more than 6 months out of the year. If you find one of these crystals in the ground, heed my warning, DO NOT TOUCH THEM!",

Some of my earliest memories are just listening to the rain fall outside as a tiny human with my dad, watching and talking between the big booms that would shake our house. I miss the excitement of waking up in the deep dark of night with the summer's lightning lending it's random, and seemingly *magical* source of light, so we don't get *too* scared of the pitch black while all alone. You don't get that old before realizing you're not actually alone in a storm. With the leaves outside twirling in the wind like they are dancing, you can hear the melody of nature coming together like an orchestra playing the beginnings of Nature's own symphony; creating music that you can only truly understand if you're both quiet and patient.\n\n&amp;Hey! Saying that just makes me want to touch them even more now &gt;.&lt; They sound pretty cool.... but I am not a crystal-y person, so I may be picturing them incorrectly \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Do you have a photo?",

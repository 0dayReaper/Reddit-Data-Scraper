    "postText": "The man in seat 43-A died halfway across the Atlantic. I was sitting near the front of the plane, just behind first class, and couldn\u2019t really see the commotion. But I could hear someone gasping and retching \u2014 loud at first, then quieter and quieter. A flight attendant got on the PA and asked for \u201cany medical professionals among the passengers\u201d to help. I guess there were none. \n\nAfter a few minutes, the man\u2019s sounds deteriorated into a sort of gurgle, then silence, then it was over.\n\nHis name was Molyneaux, and he was old but not that old, and it was likely a heart attack, aneurism, drug reaction or God\u2019s will, according to conflicting nth-hand reports that filtered down the plane from row 43, where a flight attendant simply buckled the newly deceased back into his window seat and covered his face with a complementary airline blanket.\n\nThe pilot got on the intercom and told us the plane would be turning back to New York \u201cdue to a tragic medical situation involving one of our passengers.\u201d\n\n\u201cFolks, we\u2019re looking for a volunteer willing to sit next to the deceased while we return to our originating airport,\u201d the pilot continued. \u201cThis flight is entirely full, and the person sitting there now isn\u2019t feeling comfortable. It\u2019s an aisle seat, and it will only be a few hours before we\u2019re back over land.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure why I volunteered \u2014 probably some combination of exhaustion, altruism and morbid curiosity. My vacation plans were shot anyway, I figured, so why not take the most interesting seat on the plane? The flight attendant thanked me profusely, as did a queasy looking teenager who took my original seat. I picked up my handbag and shuffled down the aisle to the very last row of the plane.\n\nMy only prior experience with corpses was an open casket funeral for my grandmother when I was a kid, but the idea of death had never particularly bothered me. It\u2019s natural, after all. That said, I admit that I second-guessed my decision as soon as I saw my new seat mate.\n\nMr. Molyneaux, rest in peace, sat upright between the window and me, strapped around the waist, with a blue fleece blanket covering his torso and head. The blanket did not cover his hands, which were resting on his lap above his seatbelt \u2014 placed that way by a flight attendant as a sign of respect, I assumed. \n\nMolyneaux\u2019s pale fingers were twisted into claws that betrayed the agony of his death. I couldn\u2019t look at those hands without imagining what his face looked like under the blanket.\n\nI thought of asking for a second blanket, but the flight crew was still busy calming down other passengers and preparing for our u-turn around the Atlantic Ocean. So I tried to forget my uneasiness and closed my eyes, and slept.\n\nI woke \u2014 hours or minutes later, I don\u2019t know \u2014 to the jostling of turbulence. The cabin lights were off and most of the passengers around me seemed to be sleeping. I looked out the window, trying not to look at Molyneaux as I did so, and saw only the uniform blackness of the night. I imagined the ocean miles below us, lightless and cold. The thought unsettled me and I reached across Molyneaux to close the window shade.\n\nThen I stopped myself. *Hadn\u2019t the shade been closed when I sat down?*\n\nI realized there was something else off about the scene. Molyneaux\u2019s posture had somehow changed while I slept. It took me a few seconds to pinpoint it. His gnarled hands remained on his lap, he was still belted at the waist, and the blanket still shrouded his upper body. But the fabric looked somehow twisted now, as if he had been fidgeting.\n\nVery slowly \u2014 knowing it was insane even as I knew I couldn\u2019t stop myself \u2014 I lifted a corner the blanket. \n\nI uncovered his shirt, which the flight crew had unbuttoned while trying to save him. A patch of blue-grey skin sprouting white chest hair peeked out from it.\n\nI lifted the blanket higher. His collar was flecked with dried blood. I remembered his terrible gasping.\n\nFinally, I pulled the blanket entirely off, and stifled a scream.\n\nMolyneaux\u2019s head was turned away from me, exactly as if he had turned to stare out the window. \n\nI could see his face reflected in the plexiglass. It was undoubtably a dead man\u2019s face: pale, drawn, lips parted, jaw slack. There was no life in it.\n\nExcept his eyes. They were moving.\n\nI stared at the reflection for half a minute and I\u2019m sure of it. In the center of that death mask, two pupils flicked back and forth, as if tracking something out there in the sky.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d a voice beside me interrupted. I whipped around and saw the woman seated across the aisle staring at me \u2014 not so much in fear as disgust. \u201cCover him back up! Give him his peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s \u2026 I think he\u2019s been moving,\u201d I stammered. \u201cHis eyes. I think he might not actually be \u2026.\u201d \n\nBut I couldn\u2019t finish the sentence; it was too crazy. Nor did I have to, because at that moment my stomach dropped ten feet along with everything else in the plane. \n\nCoffee cups and purses slammed against the ceiling. A man near the first class section nearly tumbled out of his seat. I heard call lights going off all over the plane as passengers were jolted awake in panic and confusion.\n\n\u201cPassengers, please take your seats, buckle in, and secure any loose items,\u201d the pilot said over the PA, sounding shaken himself. \u201cThe weather along our flight path is clear and no planes in the area are reporting turbulence, so I\u2019m not sure what this is. But we should be through it momentarily.\u201d\n\nEven as he spoke, the mild background shaking I\u2019d felt since waking up became noticeably more violent. The woman across the aisle began fumbling for her seatbelt, no longer paying any attention to me or Molyneaux.\n\nI forced myself to look at him again. The jolt must have caused him to pitch forward at the waist, his head colliding with the seat in front of him. \n\nBut Molyneaux\u2019s face was still turned toward the window \u2014 his neck twisted at such a sharp angle that I worried it had snapped.\n\nI looked at his hands again, and the pallor of his skin. Three flight attendants and a dozen passengers had witnessed this man\u2019s death, and I could not rationally imagine they were mistaken. \n\nAnd yet in the reflection of the window, his eyes left to right, left to right.\n\nI had heard that strange reflexes sometimes kick in after death \u2014 limbs flailing, headless chickens running, nerves clearing out the last backlog of instructions from the brain. But the eyes? I had never heard of that.\n\nI made myself look past that unsettling reflection, at the sky itself. It was still dark, moonless and cloudless, but the atmosphere seemed to have taken on a strange hue \u2014 a very dark green, like pea soup fog. I thought I could see vague shapes swirling around in the murk, though it might have been an optical illusion. I recoiled.\n\nI desperately wanted to be anywhere else right then, but the rest of the cabin was approaching a state a pandemonium. Flight attendants were hurrying up and down the aisles, attending to spills and bruises, even as they tripped and staggered. The entire plane was shuddering like a barrel going down the rapids. \n\nA series of jolts sent Molyneaux\u2019s upper body swinging back and forth like an upside down pendulum. He was thrown backward into his seat, then sideways into me (a horrible feeling I will never forget), and then the opposite way, his face slamming directly into the window, where it came to rest.\n\nThat was enough for me. I unbuckled, leapt out of my seat and locked myself in the bathroom directly behind me. I would cower on a toilet for the rest of this hellish flight rather than spend another minute sitting with Mr. Molyneaux.\n\nThis plan worked for a half hour or so. I braced both my arms against the bathroom\u2019s walls and listened to the chimes of flight attendant call buttons, the whine of jet engines and the growling of the sky. I tried to calm myself by visualizing the skyline of New York, the JFK air strip, a calm descent.\n\nBut then I imagined Molyneaux\u2019s window, his face mashed up against the glass like a little boy\u2019s, his dead eyes searching the night.\n\nThe captain\u2019s disembodied voice called me back to reality. He sounded outright scared now, and the PA kept cutting in and out.\n\n\u201c \u2026 extremely anomalous weather \u2026 need everyone in their seats in the emergency position \u2026 immediately \u2026 if we depressurize \u2026 \u201d\n\nThe turbulence stopped for four or five seconds, and then suddenly it felt like I was inside a washing machine. I bounced against the walls of the bathroom, landed on the floor, and could barely manage to get the door open and crawl on all fours into the aisle.\n\nAll three flight attendants were down, sprawled on backs and bellies between the seats. Some of the overhead luggage bins had burst open and spewed baggage out. Many of the passengers were weeping. A few prayed. And through it all, the plane would not stop shaking.\n\nI heard a series of small bangs above my head and felt something wet on my cheek. Every single soda can in the galley had exploded. I climbed into my seat and belted myself in, having briefly forgotten about Molyneaux in my terror.\n\nTHWACK THWACK\n\nBut he was still in his seat of course, whipping back and forth like a flagpole in a hurricane, head-butting the window so hard that I could see the plexiglass balloon outwards and rebound each time. \n\nTHWACK\n\nI became worried he\u2019d crack the window, though that\u2019s supposed to be impossible, so I overcame my revulsion and grabbed his shoulders. But I couldn\u2019t restrain him. \n\nAgain and again, his head hit the window. I began to fear that it was not simply the motion of the plane that compelled him. \n\nTHWACK THWACK THWACK\n\nNo one else on the plane was watching this. Some of the passengers had rallied and were trying to pull the injured flight attendants out of the aisle. Others were whispering goodbye messages into their phones.\n\nTHWACK THWACK KRKRRRRR\n\nI heard something crack beside me, and hoped desperately that it was Molyneaux\u2019s skull, and not the window. Outside I could see that the green fog was alive with swirling, amorphous shapes.\n\nTHWACK KRKRRRR KRKOOM KRKOOM\n\nAnother explosion. Not pop cans this time, but pressurized oxygen escaping into sky. Molyneaux had managed to smash out both window panes in one, final blow. Now his mangled head was hanging outside the plane, and the rest of his body was straining to follow it, restrained only by his seatbelt and the width of his shoulders.\n\nAn alarm went off in the cabin, and a jungle of oxygen masks fell from the ceilings. I put mine on at once, but heard other people screaming. Some passengers were trying desperately to get masks on the unconscious air crew, but the plane was shaking more violently than ever, and loose debris was flying up the aisles toward my row \u2014 toward the hole a dead man had made in the airplane.\n\n\u201c\u2026 cabin breach\u2026\u201d said the pilot. \u201c\u2026 limited backup oxygen, so I\u2019m trying to descend to a safe altitude \u2026 but hard to do that in this storm, or whatever it is \u2026 God be with us.\u201d\n\nOnce I was sure that I could breath and was no in danger of being sucked out myself, I took one last look at Molyneaux. His head might have torn clean off outside the window, for all I could see of it past the rest of his body. \n\nI pictured those eyes again, which had seen something in the sky that we had not seen \u2014 could not see, even as it now threatened to shake the plane apart. There was some connection between these events that I might never understand. But even without understanding, I could make the last move available to me.\n\nI reached over Molyneaux\u2019s lap, lifted one of those cold, clawed hands, and unclasped his seatbelt.\n\nThere was an intolerable crunching noise as, I presume, his shoulders were squeezed and crushed to fit the window frame. And then in a split second he was gone \u2014 out the window, into the night, a pale old man falling end over end toward the black ocean.\n\n\u201cWhatever you saw out there,\u201d I whispered. \u201cWhatever you were looking for, go to it and leave us be.\u201d\n\nThe green fog lifted a few minutes later, and the plane descended until it was safe to breath without the masks. Less than an hour later, I really did see the JFK airstrip. A whole squadron of police and ambulances met us on the way down. The flight attendants and several passengers had to be hospitalized, but as far as I know no one suffered serious injuries. \n\nFederal investigators eventually concluded that we had flown through a localized weather anomaly \u2014 witnessed by no other plane in the sky that night. Some sort of debris must have been flying around up there with us and taken out the window at 43-A, they wrote in their report: \u201cThis event led to a sudden loss of cabin pressure, in which the body of a passenger who had died earlier in an unrelated medical emergency was ejected from the plane.\u201d  \n\nI expected to hear a lot more about it on the news, but I suppose in the end it was just one of those things. The airline had no interest in publicizing the incident, of course, and the passengers had no desire to relive it. \n\nFor most people on the flight, it was simply a freak tragedy followed by a close call, and all\u2019s well that ends well. I\u2019m the only one that will dream for the rest of my life about Molyneaux\u2019s eyes, and what they saw on the way to the ocean.",

Hes probably a modern Jonah and like Johnas ship was tossed about in a storm (he was trying to run away from god lol) the plane was probably just an innocent bystander who allowed him aboard unknowing that hed upset something or someone. \n\nJonah was cast overboard after they drew lots to determine who pissed god off, but this dude knew he was the reason and even in death tried to get away and save the rest of the plane from the punishment that was meant only for him. \n\nIf this is what happened,  then dead dude is actually more of a hero than you gave him credit for even if he did put many innocent people in danger. That's what I'm hoping anyway.",

It knocked him unconscious but his feet hooked around something, I believe it was the control stick. so there's this guy halfway out the front window, and the crew desperately clutching on to someone they don't know who's alive or dead. He made it out alive, oddly enough. I'll go look up the flight number.\n\nEDIT: [British Airways 5390](https://youtu.be/bqRWupOv8DQ) Behind the link is a documentary about the whole thing. I felt really bad for giggling at the image of this guy flapping halfway out the front of a plane, plastered against the windshield going 500 miles per hour.",

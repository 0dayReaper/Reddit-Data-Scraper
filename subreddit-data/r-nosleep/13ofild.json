    "postText": "So far I've been on three dates.\r  \n\r  \nThree different people. Three different dates.\r  \n\r  \nThe first person was Max. Exceptionally tall and slim. We went out to a restaurant and talked all night, about things that I can't recall. Every word seemed so important that I felt the need to linger on it for a while, but the subjects changed so rapidly and so fluidly, like a flowing river. He presented himself in a charming manner, subtly flirting with me and yet still not being overtly forward. We both enjoyed the night, and made plans to catch up sometime in the near future.\r  \n\r  \nHe was found, early the next day, slumped over a garbage bin in an alleyway. His legs were cut off, and were placed against his body, the blood from the incision trailing down his back. His heart was removed from his body and was never found.\r  \n\r  \nNeedless to say, that shook me. I had never had a death impact me that hard, the gruesomeness of it all felt like a punch to the gut. I felt as if I was stuck in a rut, with no way of clambering out. I had found someone that, for the first time, I had felt such a strong *connection* to. He seemed to be the perfect man, and now he was gone, cruelly taken from this world. Sleep was hard to come by, and my tears flowed freely.\n\nThen I met Evan. \n\nHe was of a middling size, his physique not as appealing as Max's, but he was extremely intelligent and humorous enough to make up for it. We went to the cinemas for a first date, and had to leave halfway through the movie on account of the fits of laughter he would send me in. We instead made our way to a nearby park, talking and laughing, and having a great time. I left cheerful, and brimming with hope that Evan would be the key to helping me move on.\r  \n\r  \nHe was found at home, sprawled on the floor. His scalp was removed from his head, and his brain was cut in half, and left by his side. His heart was also removed from his body. The detective I spoke with mentioned that the incisions were perfectly straight, cutting in ways that a simple knife wouldn't be able to do. Which meant that these killings were not some random attack, but rather one of purpose. Someone had killed Evan methodically.\n\nAnd enjoyed it.\r  \n\r  \nOne death could be written of as a coincidence, things like these do happen. But two...something else was going on. And the correlating factor seemed to be dating me. \r\n\nAnd so when Mathew asked me out, I was hesitant. But he was persistent, he knew full well what had happened to my other dates and was confident that he could take care of himself. Standing at 6'5, he was a mountain of a man, after all.\r  \n\r  \nIt was a simple evening. We ordered in pizza at his apartment and watched Netflix. That new show everyone is talking about. Afterwards, he took my virginity. It was the most amazing experience I ever had, and judging by the way Mathew performed, he definitely wasn't a first-timer. Leaving his house I felt happy and fulfilled. But worried. Very worried.\r  \n\r  \nHe was found outside a gym, his torso cut in half, and his heart removed. Another chat with a detective revealed that this was the most brutal of the attacks. While both Evan and Max were killed instantly, an autopsy revealed Mathew was kept alive for hours and tortured to the point of collapsing.  The bruises that covered his body painted a tale of unimaginable horror.\n\nThe police began to question me more, as there were three suspicious deaths all related to me. I retreated inside my self, and rarely left the house for anything. Life became bleak and worthless. Everything just seemed...meaningless. I was terrified to meet new people, afraid that even them saying hello to me would result in their death. I was scared that the killer would choose me as their next victim, subjugating me to all manner of vile acts.\n\nMy life was a danger to anyone I loved. And so, I would not allow myself to love anymore.\n\nRetreating inside my house was the only viable option.\n\nI opened my door yesterday to a bouquet of flowers. I let out a half-hearted smile, realizing that someone was trying to cheer me up. Most likely a worried family member. Touched by the thoughtfulness, I picked up the flowers, and tried to find a vase somewhere in my house to place them in. As I was walking through my house, three pieces of paper fluttered out of the flowers and onto the ground.\r  \n\r  \nFurrowing my brow, I picked them up and took a closer look at them.\r  \n\r  \nOn each piece of paper was a polaroid photo of a human heart. And on the back of each photo was a message, scribbled in pen.\r  \n\r  \n*Only my heart belongs to you.*\n\n[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/ineedabettersub/)",

    "postText": "My mother thinks it\u2019s a miracle.\n\nYesterday my childhood dog showed up at my house after having disappeared thirty years ago, and I\u2019ve been trying to figure out what is happening and what it means. \n\nTo say I\u2019m unsettled would be an understatement. \n\nI\u2019m not on the best terms with my mother. We never had the best relationship, but she\u2019s been pushing boundaries really terribly ever since my son was born. She\u2019ll show up out of the blue demanding to spend time with him, demanding \u201cgrandmother privileges\u201d without giving us any heads up or letting us prepare ourselves for company, she\u2019ll take things from the house without asking, she tried to bully us into letting her move in, that sort of thing. It doesn\u2019t bug me terribly, maybe because I\u2019m used to it, but my wife has been on the verge of blowing up and banning her from our house for months. \n\nSo when I called her up to tell her about this dog that I could swear was Shadow, I should have braced for the worst. \n\nShe practically broke down the door rushing over to our house in a matter of minutes. \n\nI couldn\u2019t think of any distinguishing characteristics other than his dichromatic eyes and the fact that I\u2019d never seen a dog that looked quite like him, but my mother remembered that Shadow had a missing toe on his left front paw, and we were always curious as to what had happened. \n\nSure enough, this returned Shadow was missing the same toe. \n\nOn that note, my mother has never been the least bit religious, but I think Shadow turning up after all these years is triggering some sort of conversion. \n\n\"It must be a sign. God wants us to have another shot with him,\" she said. \n\n\"You're religious now?\" I asked.\n\n\"This is proof of something, isn't it? Your childhood dog, your best friend has returned after thirty years to protect your son. That's incredible!\"\n\nFor once, she and my wife finally agree on something: we\u2019re keeping \u201cShadow.\u201d I\u2019m leery as all hell about it, and what scares me more than anything i just how comfortable he\u2019s making everyone else around him. Last night my wife and mother were watching television and eating popcorn with Shadow curled up at their feet. I swear, I haven\u2019t seen them more at peace together than in that moment, and even I have to admit it makes me feel bad that I\u2019m trying to deprive them of that, but there is something unnatural about this whole ordeal. Something bad. \n\nIt's like nobody is listening to reason. \n\nThose hairs on the back of your neck that stand up from some signal deep in the mammalian brain, that tell you something is very wrong \u2014 get out of this situation now \u2014 alarm bells are going off, it feels like I'm the only one who has them in this family.\n\nApparently he showed up at our door while I was at work yesterday and my wife brought him in to get him a snack and some water. She's a dog person, so seeing the majestic animal panting at our doorstep she naturally trusted him and let him in. \n\n\"You brought in a wild animal with our infant son in the house?\" I asked, honestly flabbergasted. \n\n\"He's not some wild wolf or something. He's a dog and very obviously a good one at that. I could just tell.\"\n\nI remembered back to childhood, that gruff voice that came from Shadow detailing each gory moment of the scene that would happen if he chose to rip out my sister's throat, the flesh torn open, the blood drenching the cartoon pillowcase, the splatter on her curtains as he shook her windpipe like a dead rat. I looked at him, and the way he looked at me was as if he knew. \n\n\"Every moment he's in this house I'm going to be afraid of what he'll do.\" I told her.\n\n\"He's a good dog. Your mom says you were inseparable from him when you were a kid. What's changed?\" \n\n\"Why is nobody listening to me? He was possessive of me but I was always terrified of him. I don't want him in our house.\" I said.\n\n\"You're being so irrational about this,\" she said. \n\nIrrational? I'm sorry, I'm not convinced a dog can be thirty-seven years old. \n\nMy brain's not some cabinet of horrors. I get that I have the reputation in my family as still being some sort of imaginative child even though all that stopped thirty years ago, but it feels to me that these red flags I'm seeing everywhere are pretty obvious. \n\nHonestly the worst thing is that after never being civil to each other for six and a half years my wife and mother are abruptly best friends. My wife even invited my mother to come stay with us for a while. \n\nMy wife and I were in the kitchen after dinner when she brought the idea up. I had been drying a plate and it slip out of my hands and broke on the floor.\n\n\"An extra pair of hands around the house won't hurt.\"\n\n\"An extra pair of hands and a drooling maw,\" I said. The dog looked up at me and I felt like it grabbed my voice. \n\nI cleaned up the broken plate, downcast. The moment she brought it up I knew I'd already lost that argument. I've been burning through overtime at work to pay for childcare, but that's left so much extra housework for my wife that it's really not fair to her for me to argue on this. We need the help. \n\nSo in addition to worrying about this demon dog or whatever Shadow is, I'm having to move everything out of my office to make my mother a guest room, and the emotional dynamic of my marriage has completely shifted overnight. \n\nMost of the things in my office I don't really use. I carried the files downstairs and had started the laborious project of trying to disassemble my wire shelves when I heard my son babbling in the other room. He was never this talkative.\n\nI came into my son's room as the sun was dipping below the window and bathing the room in golden light. Shadow was there, but this time he was standing on his hind legs, almost as if he was human. His hair puffed up and he looked powerful, regal, wise. He stood there gazing at my son. \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cgo back to where you came from. I don\u2019t want you here.\u201d \n\nWhen he turned to look at me his eyes burned into mine with an intense stare, the reached into me and grabbed hold of something they found inside me. I couldn't move. An unbelievable feeling of calm washed over me and I left the room as though my body was on marionette strings. \n\nAs soon as I closed the door my paternal instincts took back over and I was immediately terrified that something was happening to my son. I yanked the door back open dreading the worst \u2014 what if the beast had carried him off, had taken him to some dark hole we would never find to eat his tender body \u2014 what if he'd come back again from some rotten hell to take everything from me and there was nothing I could do to stop him. But when the door flew open Shadow was sitting there as a regular dog, wagging his tail while my son said nonsense syllables to him.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t real. Something was off. It was like the scene was only in my imagination. My eyes, they weren\u2019t even open, how could what I was seeing be real if my eyes weren\u2019t even open? \n\nI focused with everything I had. My body felt like it was moving through wet concrete \u2014 if I didn\u2019t shuck it off right now it would solidify and I wouldn\u2019t be able to regain control again. \n\nI focused, even as something pushed back. I pushed with all my will to open my eyes and see what was actually happening in front of me. \n\nI dredged up every ounce of courage I had against that beast, every ounce of resentment for the things he did to me in childhood. I remembered how he made me, an innocent little boy, push my sister down the stairs \u2014 how I\u2019d never recovered my relationship with her. \n\nNo, I thought. I am an adult now, not some little boy who is constantly afraid. \n\nI will see. I will, I told myself. \n\nMy eyes snapped open. I saw Shadow standing upright, bipedal, his back long, and straight, and strong, and he was holding my son, the back of his onesie caught on that animal\u2019s teether. He looked at me with golden eyes, stared into me, but I refused to budge \u2014 I refused to let him back into me even an inch. \n\nI realized he was frozen too. For some reason he couldn\u2019t move while he was trying to exert his will over me. My son wriggled and I knew he was destined to fall any moment. \n\nI pushed through the room, every step heavy and exhausting. I grabbed my son out of \u201cShadow\u2019s\u201d mouth and wrenched him free, and I backed out of the room. \n\nAs soon as I was free of the room I regained full control of my body and dashed down the stairs holding my infant son. I was going to get us out of this, no matter what my wife and mother thought. \n\nI heard my wife\u2019s voice call out to me from the kitchen as I was nearly out the door. \u201cYou cannot leave with him. He is not your son anymore. Shadow will be a better father to him than you could ever be. Shadow can keep him safe.\u201d\n\nIt was my wife\u2019s voice, but those weren\u2019t her words. I couldn\u2019t put my finger on exactly what, but even if she was deranged enough to claim Shadow was my son\u2019s father, she wouldn\u2019t have used those words. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done something to you. You have to resist. You have to break free.\u201d \n\nMy mother came out of the kitchen carrying a pair of scissors as if they were knives, smiling. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I muttered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m leaving you to him, but I have to make sure our son is safe. I\u2019ll be back for you. I promise.\u201d\n\nI slammed the door and leapt in the car. In my bedroom window I saw Shadow watching me. I didn\u2019t even want to know what his next move would be. \n\nI drove until I was tired of driving and pulled into a parking lot to think and type this up. My son is sleeping in the car seat. For the moment, we\u2019re safe, but where we can go from here, I have no idea. \n\n[Part 1] https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/140pc2r/my_childhood_dog_just_showed_up_at_my_house_after/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button",

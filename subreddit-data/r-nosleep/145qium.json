    "postText": "I just hope that people see this post, that they might start spreading the news before it\u2019s too late. Something big is coming, something ancient, something older than any of us could have ever imagined. It might be too late. I don\u2019t know what will become of me, of the people I love that I might never see again, by the time you are reading this. But I implore you to listen and take this story seriously, because it could save your life. Or not. I don\u2019t know yet how deep this goes. If it\u2019s true, if what I think is true\u2026God help us. Nothing can save us now. \n\nI\u2019ll start at the beginning, because you need to understand how long this has been happening, and the implications of what is possible now that it\u2019s getting worse. \nOver winter break, I went to visit my friend from high school, Jackson, in Vermont. He goes to Bennington College, studies Social Sciences with a minor in Linguistics. Smart guy. He used to write my papers for me in English class, and I would pay him back in six packs. That\u2019s always how it was: him, studious and put together, and me itching to get outside. I was constantly on the move, biking through the forests behind my house, trail-running, building a treehouse for my little brothers, you name it. I wanted to get my hands dirty, get into nature. I guess that\u2019s why I opted out of college, and went for camp counselor positions and summer gigs until I secured a conservation job with a park near home. Nature is important to me, and I want to do my part as the generation that has a responsibility to heal the world.\n\nThe outside was what called me to Bennington, aside from the fact that I missed my best buddy. I don\u2019t remember when it was first brought to my attention, but I became aware of murmurings of Bennington\u2019s rocky past online about a few months before I was set to visit Jackson. Being an experienced outdoorsman,  I wasn\u2019t afraid; on the contrary, I was rather excited to get out there and prove my worth to Jackson and his college buddies, who were far less athletic than I am.\nLooking back, I\u2019m kicking myself for being so cocky. I can\u2019t believe I ever thought of my best friend in that way. \n\nFrom what I could see on the internet, Bennington College\u2019s history was a long and often sinister one. There were videos about people vanishing into thin air: a girl wearing a red parka went for a hike alone and was never found, an experienced man leading an outdoor expedition disappeared in the woods, a woman fell into a stream, doubled back to the campsite to change her clothes, but never made it to the site, a man on a bus disappeared from the vehicle at a stop but left all of his luggage, a teenage boy was waiting in his mother\u2019s truck and when she came back, he was mysteriously gone\u2026I wish I could say these stories deterred me from poking my head somewhere where it didn\u2019t belong. \n\nInstead, I only grew more curious. What was going on in this so-called \u201cBennington Triangle?\u201d I was in a unique position to investigate this phenomenon for myself. Many people hear about strange occurrences and the intrigue piques their interest, but they never have the chance to see it for themselves. But I could. I knew I could hold my own out in the wilderness\u2014it was literally my job! Besides, I was a strong, slightly stubborn young man, built steadily, and I could protect myself well. What could possibly happen to me out in those woods, much less to a group of young college-aged men? The people who went missing most likely made one fatal mistake that cost them their lives, or maybe it was all just a big coincidence. Either way, I was about to find out for myself. \n\nIt was halfway through December when I left to meet up with Jackson. I got there on the last day of classes, and Jackson told me he would be busy until later in the day. I assumed he was cramming for a final, and I told him it was no big deal, I would meet up with him and maybe meet some of his buddies later. Besides, I had some plans of my own. \n\nThe most famous missing persons case in Bennington went cold, and is still unsolved to this day. The case is a tragic one, and I didn\u2019t want to be insensitive by going around asking for information or throwing around names. Everything I needed, I found online. Paula Welden was the name of the girl in the red parka that went missing. Allegedly, she left campus one day to go on a hike by herself. She left the campus around 3pm and hitchhiked to an entrance to the Long Trail, a trail that runs for almost 300 miles from Massachusetts all the way to the Canadian Border. She wasn\u2019t dressed to be outside for long, but as the story goes, she never made it back from the trail. \n\nThere was one sighting of her, however, that particularly interested me. A man reported that he had seen her running around, rather erratically, in the bottom of a gravel pit near the entrance to campus, and I wanted to see if there was anything left of the pit. Because I\u2019m experienced with many different kinds of natural phenomena, I initially wondered if there wasn\u2019t a natural explanation for her distressed behavior. I thought maybe there might be an insect nest or an infestation of small animals at the bottom of the pit that she might have disturbed, so I decided to check it out in my free time. \n\nAfter the RA checked me in and I tossed my luggage into Jackson\u2019s dorm, I packed a small backpack with essentials: water, sunscreen, energy bars, mini first aid kit, some rope, a utility tool, a flashlight, and a lightweight jacket. Then I headed out towards the pit. \n\nThe first thing I noticed was how much smaller the pit seemed. According to the eyewitness description of the incident, Paula was running up and down the side of a deep gravel pit, but what lay in front of me now was something much more shallow. I walked down into the center of what was left of the pit, but I could easily see over the edges. The small, dark fragments of rock crunched and ground together under my hiking boots, and the slowly sinking midday sun bounced off of the remnants of white snow around me. It was an unusually sunny day for winter, and the snow was, curiously, letting up for my visit. But the good luck for me ran out here\u2014there seemed to be nothing to investigate at this location. My hopes of finding any evidence of insect or pest infestation that could have disturbed the girl were dashed, maybe buried several feet underground. \n\nI lingered awhile, kicking at the bits of gravel in the small pit. I watched the small rocks scatter over the rest of the gravel, hitting up against the edge of the pit and rolling back down a few inches. I turned to go, but stopped. Maybe it was a trick of my eye, the sun reflecting harshly off of the snow and glinting in my sunglasses, causing me to not see clearly. I walked to the edge of the pit and kicked some more gravel at the side. The small rocks skipped across the uneven surface of the gravel pile, and scattered up the edge of the pit, farther than gravity should allow them to travel. I kicked more, and it happened again. My heart started beating faster. \n\nI crouched down and picked up a small stone. I rolled it gently across the gravel, softly enough that it started to slow when it reached the incline of the side of the pit. I watched, astounded, as the rock slowly rolled uphill about a foot before coming to a stop. I gave a shout of excitement and jumped to my feet.\n\nAs I stood up straight I nearly fell back down. In an instant, my hearing seemed to go and I felt an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia. I spun around, thinking someone must be behind me, messing with me, but the sensation of closeness stayed pressing at my back. I spun around again, searching for an explanation. My head was fuzzy. I heard my footsteps, overwhelmingly loud, and I couldn\u2019t hear anything else, almost as if my range of hearing was limited to my immediate surroundings. Like I was trapped in the pit. As soon as those words flashed through my head, the claustrophobia overwhelmed me, pushing up against the very air around my body. The silence built up inside my ears until all I could hear was my muffled footsteps, my desperate breathing, and the blood rushing faster and faster through my body. \n\nI lunged for the edge, clambering up the side as fast as I could. Instantly upon passing over the edge the sounds of the late afternoon bore down on my ears. I stumbled and covered my ears, the chirping of the birds and rustling leaves almost too loud for me to bear. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I was scared. Obviously, I was a little shaken up. As I hastened back towards Jackson\u2019s dorm, I tried to rationalize what had just happened to me. Maybe I hadn\u2019t drank enough water and I simply became dizzy. Maybe it was altitude sickness. Maybe a strange bug had bitten me and I temporarily lost my bearings. Nothing quite made sense. I tried to push it from my mind and focus on having a good first day, because soon I would be meeting Jackson\u2019s college buddies. \n\nWhen I got back to the dorm, Jackson was waiting for me. Fresh from the shower, his hair was damp and he was putting on a clean t-shirt. Pulling me into a hug, he expressed his excitement over my visit, asked me about my flight, what I thought about the campus\u2014all the preliminary niceties. Internally, I breathed a sigh of relief. Even if he noticed, he didn\u2019t pry and try to ask me about my slightly shaking hands, my pale face, or the vague disconnectedness with which I answered his questions. \n\nThat night eased my worries slightly. I ended up meeting Jackson\u2019s group of friends and, together, we ventured into downtown Bennington. We hit a few bars and chilled at some of the many breweries in town. Live music, good company, and many, many beers did wonders on my nerves. By the end of the night, I had completely forgotten all about my encounter in the gravel pit. Jackson\u2019s friends were nice guys, and I was too busy feeling proud about my best friend coming out of his shell in college. When he left, I had my doubts, but it was crystal clear that Jackson was really coming into himself at this school. \n\nThe festivities continued for the next few days: the guys were stoked to be done with their final exams and excited to connect with Jackson\u2019s old friend, so we spent our time drinking and hanging out, bumping music and generally having a blast. It was almost enough for me to forget about one of the very reasons I was excited to be in Bennington in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few days since that incident. I had even almost started to feel better about the whole thing. Maybe it was a mistake to poke around in old history, and maybe I should just focus on living my own life and fulfilling my own passions, working to heal nature as best as I can.  But now Jackson and his friends want to go on a hike, and I\u2019m starting to feel that same claustrophobia creeping back in. What the hell is out there, and why do I feel like I shouldn\u2019t be messing with it?\n\t\nJackson chose the hike, not me. It was like him; he was the researcher, he was the one who looked at details, so he suggested we hike on the Long Trail. It intersected with the Appalachian Trail, and maybe I wasn\u2019t paying attention when Jackson explained this to me, because it didn\u2019t raise any alarms about the missing persons cases. Paula Welden went missing on the Long Trail, sure\u2014but she wasn\u2019t with a group of capable college guys like I was.\n\nWe packed some backpacks, crushed a beer or two for celebratory sakes, and set off on the trail. I let myself feel excited as we stomped through the trees, Jackson and his friends decked out in their matching red Bennington shirts from graduation. \nThe hike was long. It was tedious. I don\u2019t know when I first started noticing the weird aspects around us until about an hour in. The others didn\u2019t pay any mind to these things, but I saw them: leaves drifting in the air with no breeze, snowflakes trapped in patches of sunlight, floating but unmoving, and that tree. It was a towering douglas fir, half-dead and reaching for the afternoon sun with bare branches. Each time I looked over my shoulder to check for hikers behind us or glanced ahead to see what awaited us, it was there. At first I assumed my eyes were playing tricks on me. After all, we had been hiking for a few hours. \n\t\nOnly when we stopped for a breather and Jackson pointed at a nearby stream did the weird things become too much for me. We were hiking on an incline, and we were exhausted, but when Jackson knelt beside this stream, it was flowing uphill. \nBy then I was a little panicked. I freaked out, telling them that we needed to head back. Who cares if we hadn\u2019t reached the halfway point yet? Was there even a halfway point? It felt like we had been walking for miles!\n\nOne of Jackson\u2019s buddies opened up a map of the trail on his phone, and it was blank. He had service and bars, but the map was just\u2026gone. Shocked with sudden fear, we immediately turned and headed back down the path. The sky darkened within minutes of us retracing our steps. Somehow, night was falling, despite us beginning the hike only a few hours prior. I tried to point it out, pulling Jackson aside when we slowed our pace to pass around a bottle of water. But Jackson was terrified and unfocused, and when I asked him what was wrong, we realized that one member of our five-person group was missing. How had we not noticed?\n\nSo, we made a U-turn and headed back up the mountain. Twenty minutes later, we found his torn university shirt. I turned the red fabric over in my hands, panicked and bewildered. When I looked up to scan our surroundings, I saw that same Douglas fir directly to my left. I was shocked, and the rest of the group must have noticed. We looked at each other and saw the panic rising on our faces. \nWhat the hell was happening?\n\t\nI only had one goal at this point: we had to get down the mountain to call for help.\n\nWe decided to do our best to follow the trail on the way we came up, but only once daylight broke; it was difficult to make out the trail in the dark cover of the night, so I insisted it would be too dangerous. Someone could fall and get seriously injured, we could all get separated in the dark, or worse. So we did our best to hunker down and build a makeshift shelter to wait out the night, but it wasn\u2019t easy.\nI can only describe the sounds we heard as otherworldly. Despite the lack of animals in the woods, nature seemed to be alive around us. The clicking of bugs kept me wide awake, but the noises were louder and deeper than I had ever heard. The baying of giant wolves, so close I imagined them coming up directly behind us. The snuffling of something in the underbrush, but from a cavernous creature larger than any moose could ever be. \n\nWhere had these animals been in the daytime? Why did it feel like they were surrounding us now? \n\nI don\u2019t know how I ever fell asleep, but when I awoke in the morning, the sun was beating down on us. From the sheen of sweat on my forehead to the dreadful pit in my stomach, I could tell something was horribly wrong. \n\nWhen I scrambled to my feet and glanced around the area, I realized that only Jackson and I remained at our site. It was us, the clothes on our backs, and the demure amount of leftover supplies in our pockets: keys, gum wrappers, half-eaten power bars, and anything else that was ultimately unhelpful. We had been stranded on the forest floor, us against nature, as if something had swooped in from above and whisked Jackson\u2019s friends under the pitch-black cover of the night.\n\nI frantically took in our surroundings, peering into the bushes and pushing through thorny shrubbery. There were no tracks, no drag marks. Not even broken branches. \nI told Jackson we had to get out of there, and fast. I knew we needed to find the closest trailhead and book it down the mountain. Jackson ran so fast he nearly chipped a tooth on a steep hill. He was trying to keep up with me since I was faster by a long shot. All that sports stuff in high school paid off in the moment, so I almost felt bad leaving him in the dust. I called back over my shoulder to him every minute or so, making sure he was there. \n\nHe stuck with me for the most part. His t-shirt got torn by overhanging branches at one point, leaving a nasty scrape almost as red as the decimated fabric. I found myself struggling to remember if he was wearing that shirt to begin with, back when we started.\n\nThen I decided I was losing it. It was like a fight against nature, Jackson and me against the blaring sun and sloping trail. Eventually, Jackson starts glaring menacingly at the passing scenery, cursing loudly and deliriously at everything surrounding us.\n\nWhen we stumbled upon a trail marker, we barely had enough energy to celebrate.\nWhile we caught our breath, I tried to calm Jackson down. Something told me that cursing out Mother Nature wasn\u2019t the best idea right now. Whatever was sicking the elements on us wouldn\u2019t appreciate the nasty things he was saying about them. But he was terrified, and nothing I said could slap any reason into him. I had to lead us to safety, get us out of here. \n\nSuddenly, I heard a sound in the distance. But unlike everything else we had heard so far, this one was man made. Jackson heard it too, and started yelling about a helicopter. He made a break off to the left, towards the sound, and I bolted after him. Somehow, he burst out into a tiny clearing. \n\nRipping off his red Bennington shirt, he started calling out and waving it in the air like a rescue flag. He jumped and shouted, but as the helicopter got closer, the unbelievable happened. The clearing started shrinking, tree branches reaching from either side to close the gap and obscure us from the view of the pilot. Jackson screamed in fury, cursing the forest like never before. \n\nThen the chopper must have been lowering down towards the treelike because the wind picked up, blowing in circles around us like the blades were inches from our heads, faster and faster, more violent by the second. \n\nThe brush beneath our feet blew up in the air along with the topsoil and dead leaves, obscuring our vision. We could hear each other gasping for breath, trying to keep the debris out of our eyes and coughing. I flung my arms out into the space around me, calling for my best friend and reaching out for his hands. But then I felt something shift. The decaying leaves around me smelled stronger. The wind became more vicious. The earth trembled beneath my feet, and I thought I felt something looming above me, breathing down my neck but also looking straight into my unseeing eyes.\n\nThen it clicked. Jackson's red shirt, the gravel pit, Paula's erratic behavior, the other missing hikers...something was picking these people off, luring them deeper into the woods where they were sure to never be seen again. Did the color red cause whatever it was to literally see red, like a sick, twisted joke? Like a giant bull in front of a matador? What kind of creature could it be? Such a stealthy hunter, a commanding presence that made man tremble at the sensation of its mere aura...I couldn't even think about it without snapping my mind. \n\t\nBefore the flurry of leaves and moist earth settled back onto the ground, I knew Jackson was gone. I knew the chopper hadn\u2019t seen us and that I was on my own now. I tried not to panic as I felt like every hidden eye in the forest was staring me down, sizing me up. I took off blindly, but where to, I didn\u2019t know. After what seemed like hours of desperately sprinting, I saw a pile of rocks in the distance. Shelter, I thought, and decided to rest there for a minute to get my wits back about me. \n\t\nThen I had an idea. With what little juice I had in my phone and whatever cell service luck would afford me, I knew I had to send out a warning. For some reason, I didn\u2019t think about myself. I didn\u2019t think about dying, disappearing, or whatever had happened to my friends. If the nature around me would be the thing to end my life, so be it. I had decided to dedicate my life to nature long ago: to save it from my fellow man, to preserve its beauty, and to keep it out of the wrong hands, the people that wanted to use its power for evil and to bring about the harm of those around them. I know it sounds ridiculous to be thinking about when my life was at stake, but I knew it was what I needed to do. \n\nFrom my makeshift hiding spot in the rocks, I began furiously typing my story with what little battery I had left on my phone. When my hands started cramping, I used the voice option. I didn\u2019t care. I just had to get my story out there.\n  \nFor an hour , I\u2019d been trying to put it all down in words. I couldn't believe my luck, that my battery hadn\u2019t run out yet. \n\nI had almost gone to the end when I felt the same creeping silence begin to close in on me. It was as if the forest was falling silent around me, and that silence was racing in on all sides, but it was different from when I was in the gravel pit. There was more to the sensation this time, not just the sinking, breathless feeling and the loss of hearing.\n\nSomewhere deep within the forest, but at the same time, only miles away, I heard an awful rumbling sound, something I\u2019ve never heard before. Nothing like the helicopter, not even the giant animals I was convinced I had heard in the night. I can't even think of a word to describe it, but it filled me with a frantic kind of dread that I\u2019ve never felt before. I feel it in the ground. My entire body wants to run as fast as I can, but it\u2019s like I\u2019m glued to the ground. I taste metal in my mouth like maybe I bit my cheek or the dirt from the wind or I bit on a rock, I spit and I can\u2019t get it out. I\u2019m going to open an app and copy and paste it so people can know while I still can type I\u2019m shaking so hard they have to know.\n\nAnd the smell I\u2019m smelling it\u2019s like fruit that\u2019s gone ripe, but it keeps getting more ripe, a sickly sweetness that keeps building mixed with the smell of the richest earth imaginable. \n\nThis is happening now, I\u2019m smelling this now and It\u2019s it\u2019s like I\u2019m trapped under the shadow of some thing bigger something that\u2019s taking the shadow away from the trees and I can\u2019t see the shadow of the trees anymore and the ground around me is trembling. It\u2019s like I can hear the trees calling out to whatever it is, that\u2019s walking towards me or flying I can\u2019t tell, everything is stretching and growing out towards me. No behind me above me something is coming. I\u2019m I feel better right I feel better than I have in days or however long I\u2019ve been out here I\u2019m not thirsty anymore. I\u2019m not hungry anymore. I feel fuller stronger smarter. My mind is overloading. I\u2019m thinking of 1 million things like I don\u2019t know if I can speak anymore it\u2019s like, it\u2019s like I\u2019m fruit like I\u2019m a ripening on the vine and this giant wings beating above me and the smell is too much I",

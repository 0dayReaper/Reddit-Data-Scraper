    "postText": "I know it might be weird to say, but I wish my Father never went to college. For some background, My parents had me in their teens. My Mom left and my Dad took care of me. After high school my dad didn\u2019t continue education until he was 25 and found my Step-Mom. After the wedding and my two younger siblings were born my Dad went to college, he majored in Robotics. He always liked robots, I was happy for him. He became extremely busy with college, I ended up taking more of a father role to my little siblings, Abigail and Cody. \n\nEverything was fine until my Dad graduated, I don\u2019t understand what happened but he changed. He almost became more off putting, But no one else noticed. So I never questioned anything, and I was 18 and getting ready to move out anyways. I promised my parents and siblings I\u2019d visit, call, write, etc. I was 19 when I finally moved into my own apartment, It was out of state though, which hurt my family even more. \n\nI worked minimum wage and it was hard keeping the roof over my head. After only two years I\u2019d been fired and couldn\u2019t pay rent, So I had to go crawling back to my family house, the house I sit hiding in as I type this out. \n\nI was greeted by my siblings, Abby, now 10 years old, and Conner, now 12. They came running out hugging me, I felt warm at first, to be with my family again, but then It\u2019s like my stomach dropped. I don\u2019t know why. It was my siblings, but it felt like I was hugging complete strangers. I brushed it off, probably jet lag. I went inside and hugged my Step-Mom. I didn\u2019t see my Dad though. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe\u2019s out,\u201d The three of them said almost in unison.\n\nBy the time dinner was ready My father had returned, \u201cSon! So happy to see you face to face again,\u201d It felt like it was my old Dad again, he felt so warm in our embrace. \n\nAfter dinner I sat on the couch watching cartoons with my siblings. They eventually fell asleep on me, thats when I changed the channel. It was the local news channel, It was currently going over the weather. \n\nThen it changed to two people sitting at the table, \u201cNext the Murder case currently going on in Salt Lake City,\u201d A murder case? I thought, What on earth happened while I was gone. \u201c5 month ago 3 murders struck Salt Lake, When Veronica Adams, and her two children, Abigail and Conner Adams, were found dead after being missing for 2 month,\u201d I could feel the color drain from my face. This had to be some horrible dream. A bad welcome back joke. My heart beat raced as the news caster continued, but I couldn\u2019t take in anymore details. I finally realized, they were all cold. Was I hugging some zombies all day!? But then how were they\u2019re bodies found? It didn\u2019t make sense. I felt a cold, almost doll like hand touch my arm. I jumped up and turned to face the couch. My two siblings stared at me, Their eyes lifeless. They kept saying versions of \u201cWhats wrong?\u201d I felt like I couldn\u2019t breath. \u201cOur main suspect of the case is, Bill Adams, the husband and father of the victims,\u201d I felt my heart drop. My eyes teared up. \n\n\u201cSon? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d My Father suddenly said in the door way of the Living room. I backed away slowly, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d He grinned, \u201cI\u2019m making sure this family stays together forever,\u201d Tears flooded down my face, \u201cYou killed them!\u201d He kept coming closer and closer to me. I had to get out, \u201cEveryone dies eventually, Son.\u201d \n\nJust as soon as He got far enough away I ran for the door, My dumbass decided to run into the basement. I locked the door and ran down the stairs. I turned on the lights. It was practically empty. I took out my phone and dialed 9-1-1, I could hear my father call for me at the top of the stairs behind the door. \u201c9-1-1, What\u2019s your emergency?\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to say, \u201cMy dad is a murderer!\u201d I blurted out, \u201cI need help! I locked myself in the basement!\u201d \n\nThe dispatcher told me to calm down, asked me my name, and address. \u201cWhat makes you believe this?\u201d I didn\u2019t know how to say it, My family is dead but isn\u2019t and my Father practically admitted to it. Sounds like a bad horror story. \n\nI looked around the room, and saw it. A mannequin? Doll? no\u2026 it was a robot. A robot that looked exactly like me. It\u2019s lifeless eyes stared into my soul. \u201cSir? Hello?\u201d I began to speak when all the sudden, My phone died. Of fucking course. The cops are on their way. I should be fine. And then theres a crash. He\u2019s breaking through the door. \n\nSo here I am. On a old laptop I found in desperation to tell anyone my story. I don\u2019t think the cops will be here in time, and he\u2019s close to getting a big enough hole to climb in through. I hope he rots.",

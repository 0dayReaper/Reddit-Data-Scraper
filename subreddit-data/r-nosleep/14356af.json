    "postText": "Waking up is always hard. You're disoriented, there's often loud sounds to force you into consciousness, you might be jolted out of a deep sleep or a strange dream, and if you wear a sleep mask like myself you have to let your eyes adjust from total darkness to light. \n\nThis morning was no different, except for two things. 1, my alarm didn't wake me, I'm not sure what did, and 2, I smelled something faint and unexpected, bleach. Being an insomniac I do have bursts of random cleaning late at night, but last night wasn't one of them. I live alone in my country house way off the road, so waking up to something so obviously inexplicable was very concerning. I tried to remember if I had woken in the night and done something to cause the smell, but after a few moments of deep consideration I knew I hadn't. The reason? I was out of bleach. \n\nI got out of bed and my body hurt all over. This isn't new, I'm in my late 40's and a farmer, my lifestyle is hard on my meatsuit. What was new was the unfamiliar pains in muscles I don't normally use on a regular basis. Growing concerned I started looking around and checking the house for the source of the smell, but my two cows had started their crying to be milked and the rooster was crowing like mad to be let out of the coop with his flock, so I threw on clothes and got to work. \n\nLater that night after helping my only pig birth her piglets, I was stretched out in my large deep tub to soak away the day's labors when I remembered the oddities of the morning. I pondered what it could have been about but growing increasingly tired I decided to try to make it an early night. I was just tired and confused, sure it was nothing. \n\nThe next morning it happened again. This time I was woken from a deep sleep, so was even more disoriented. It was still dark and early, but the smell was stronger. When I checked the time I realized it was only 3am and the bleach smell was so strong it burned my nose and eyes. I got out of bed determined to find the source of this disconcerting situation, but when I put weight on my legs they buckled under me. Something was very wrong with my body so I called 911 to send an ambulance. What they found will confound me forever. \n\nOne of my kidneys is gone. There's no evidence of a wound, no scar tissue, no evidence it was ever there to begin with. I also have somehow misplaced half my liver. Again, it's just...gone. Police searched my home and property and found evidence that my pig's trough had human tissue in it. The reason I couldn't stand? A quarter of my calves in both legs are gone as well. It's like the connective tissues never existed despite all the evidence to the contrary. They are holding me for two days while my brother came to care for my animals. \n\nHe called me this morning and told me something doesn't feel right. I asked him if he noticed anything strange, and he admitted that he woke up unexpectedly to the smell of bleach. I don't know what this is, how it's happening, or why, but it happened again. As I write this my eyes and nose are burning, and the nurses are looking for the source. I'm worried what part of me is missing this time, and just how much more can be taken before there's nothing [left.](http://r/Katerinara_Horror\n)",

Is your brother staying at your place? Is it having the same effect on him? OMG get your animals checked ASAP!\n\nI've woken up with missing organs and muscle  mass before, but I found myself in a hospital bed. I can't imagine how this is happening to you, especially without scars or stitches and staples.... I never think this but.....\ud83d\udc7d?",

I told him he needs to get to the hospital to find out if he's missing anything. They have me signed up for a full body scan, but apparently it's not like on TV, you can wait days for the machine to be free. I just hope there's enough left of me to examine when my turn comes around. I didn't even think about the animals, but now that you mention it I do vaguely remember not seeing a few chickens, but they are like that sometimes. Plus, the coop is as secure as I could make it but predators are tenacious. I'm gonna make some calls to get my animals moved to neighboring farms, I don't want them to come to harm!",

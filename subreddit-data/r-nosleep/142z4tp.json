    "postText": "Imagine walking into a burning building, and everyone laughs and tells you the fire\u2019s all in your head. When no one believes you, are you going to stay to burn up with them? *Every* passenger in that crowd waiting to embark on the luxury cruise was already dead\u2014[they just didn\u2019t know it yet!](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/140khwa/i_went_on_a_cruise_and_all_the_passengers_were/) I stared through the windows of the terminal at the magnificent Seastar, at the broken glass and spatters of blood that only I could see\u2026 and then I fled.\n\nWithout warning a single soul.\n\nWhat would have been the point? My name is Cassandra\u2014I *see* death six days before it happens, and can feel it if I shake a cold hand\u2014but no matter what I do, I can never, *ever* prevent it.\n\nMy flight took me as far as the escalators before a flash of purple brought me screeching to a halt. Lily Tsuki? No\u2014it wasn\u2019t the purple-haired musician who\u2019d given me with cruise gift card. But suddenly I remembered how I\u2019d been looking forward to hearing her performance aboard this very vessel\u2026\n\nOh God\u2026\n\nIt was one thing to turn my back on doomed strangers. Terrible as it sounds, it\u2019s a bit like reading about a catastrophe in the news. Quite another thing to abandon somebody I *knew!* Could I really leave her to become one of the bodies putrefying in the belly of the Seastar? Every time I ordered a drink at my favorite bar, I\u2019d remember I hadn\u2019t even tried to save her!\n\n\u201cFuck!\u201d I cried, fumbling for my phone. \u201cOh, fuck me sideways\u2026 how much time\u2026?\u201d\n\nNinety minutes.\n\nNinety minutes to get on board, find the musician, and\u2026 what? Convince her to disembark?\n\n*How?*\n\nAnd yet my feet were already turning toward the gangplank\u2014because as it turns out, I would rather plunge headlong into a ship full of the rotting dead than face an empty piano bench and the guilt that no amount of alcohol would ever drown. But to have any chance at persuading Lily, I\u2019d need to know *how* the passengers died. This meant that in addition to finding a purple-haired needle in a Titanic-sized haystack, a horrifying task loomed ahead of me. I was going to have to do something I had not done in a *very* long time\u2014plunge directly into my vision. Walk into its very maw and face whatever gruesome horrors lurked at the source of that nauseating odor.\n\nI was going to have to find the bodies\u2026\n\n\u2026 and whatever killed them.\n\n**Boarding**\n\nThe stench was so overpowering after crossing the gangplank that I dropped to my knees and dry heaved. The flow of passengers moved around me past the concierge desk. I must have looked exceptionally sick, because a pretty girl in a suit skirt approached, asking if I needed assistance. She reached out a hand to help me up\u2014*cold!*\n\nI staggered away from her and inside. Then\u2014because I felt I might throw up\u2014quickly found my way out to the promenade deck and the blessed breeze.\n\nLifeboats hung overhead. Beyond the rail, the sea sparkled in the afternoon sun. Cushioned loungers lined the deck. None were in use, presumably because the pool, patio, spa, and other amenities on the upper decks had much more attractive areas for lounging. I leaned against the rail and gulped the air, listening to the waves splash against the side of the boat, noting blood spatters further down\u2014but nothing signifying the *cause* of the blood. Just vague signs of violence.\n\nAfter circling the entire promenade deck and spotting only the occasional bloody spatters, I gritted my teeth, pulled my shirt collar up over my nose, and plunged into the nearest door.\n\nThe Seastar\u2019s interior had the atmosphere of a luxury hotel. People milled about the restaurant and shopping area, buzzing with excitement, talking about cabaret shows and fine dining, while perky crew members answered questions, all perfectly oblivious to the putrid sweet rotting stench. I\u2019d most likely find Lily Tsuki at the piano lounge, but since I didn\u2019t yet have any plausible explanation for what had happened to the passengers, I continued wandering, entering a bustling caf\u00e9 overlooking the ship\u2019s grand staircase. Stepping over an enormous blood stain on the carpet, I passed the counter, nauseated by the fancy pastries behind their glass cases, peering among the tables and chairs. Paused when I spotted an eyeball in a teacup. No trace of how it got there. No body with an empty socket. Just the eyeball, swirling in a congealed bloody jelly at the bottom of the cup\u2026\n\nI scurried away, snatching a cloth napkin to cover my nose.\n\nThe interior darkened as I ascended the central staircase. *No electricity,* I noted as I clutched the railing. Why would the power be cut? A storm?\n\nBut storms don\u2019t scoop out eyeballs with a dessert spoon\u2026.\n\nComing onto deck 6, I peered down a long, dim corridor lined with passenger cabins. To passengers coming and going, the hall was illuminated by electric lighting\u2014but since I was seeing the ship six days in the future, the narrow hallway vanished into blackness. With no way to enter the cabins, and nothing much to see here or in the other dimmed halls of the passenger decks, I ascended until I reached the pool.\n\n**Pool Deck**\n\nDeck 9 opened to wide panoramic windows, dining, a spa, and of course the pool. I emerged outdoors with relief, removing the napkin from my nose as the sea breeze gave some respite from the odor.\n\nAround me, people partied in bikinis and beachwear and suits, sipping all manner of drinks around the sky-blue swimming pool. A young woman stretched on a blood-spattered lounger, oblivious to the gore beneath her tanned figure. A few bodies floated among the swimmers, bloated and discolored. My vision shimmered briefly as a teen boy swam right through one of the bodies, splashing as if it were not there. My heart lurched when I realized that it was his *own,* albeit dressed in different clothes\u2014\n\n\u201c*Oof*!\u201d I grunted as a small figure bashed into me, her arm grazing mine.\n\n\u201cSorry!\u201d cried a little girl in a pink swimsuit, bolting by as her mother yelled at her to watch out for people.\n\nI tried not to think of how *cold* the little girl\u2019s arm felt. Counted the bodies: eight in the pool. One by the towel bin, head caved in. I made a circuit of the pool, occasionally brushing against people\u2014*cold, cold, cold.*\n\nNo survivors, it seemed.\n\nBut *why?*\n\nThat was when I spotted a shirtless old man sitting at a table under an umbrella. I froze, goosebumps prickling along my skin. Unlike the floaters, there was no obvious reason for his death. His back was to me, the bare skin of his shoulders gray and blotchy. In his hand he held a broken drinking glass. He was positioned in repose\u2026 so what killed him?\n\nMy heart quickened as I moved round to the front of him.\n\nHis mouth hung open, shards of glass and a mangled tongue lolling out, crimson trailing down his shirt front. The source of the chewed glass was obvious\u2014the cup in his hand was broken, its jagged edges bloody.\n\nHe\u2019d died choking on the glass.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is happening here?\u201d I whispered.\n\n**Forward Stairwell**\n\nThe jogging track and the sundeck\u2014decks 10 and 11\u2014offered a stunning bird\u2019s eye of the pool and ocean, but I did not stop to take this in as I circled to the bow, opting to take the forward stairs down, rather than central.\n\nThe stench hit me like a cloud.\n\nI had to stop as I descended into the dim stairwell, clinging to the railing, doubled over, gagging. It was so *so* bad. My eyes watered. My stomach bucked. And it was *dark.* Thank God for my phone\u2019s flashlight. I fumbled it on and, napkin firmly over my nose, plunged down into the depths\u2026 The phone\u2019s thin illumination flashed along the carpeted stairwell and the hall of the first of the passenger decks. I kept descending. Paused at an unidentifiable slick red mound. I was examining it under my light when a crewmember jogged up to me and asked, \u201cLose something, miss?\u201d \u201cJust my marbles,\u201d I muttered, shooing the crew member away and inadvertently brushing his hand. *Cold.* I turned my attention back to the mound.\n\nA slimy pile of intestines on the stairwell\u2026 trailing down to a disemboweled body.\n\n*Intestines\u2026 eyeballs\u2026 eating broken glass\u2026 nothing about this makes sense!* I swiveled the beam to check further downward.\n\nThat was when I found the source of the odor.\n\nMy path down was obstructed by a mass of bodies. The ones underneath seemed to have been trampled, but the ones on top\u2026 I squeezed my watering eyes and retched against the wall. Some of the bodies bore horrible mutilations\u2014fingers bent and twisted, joints out of alignment, faces smashed in and jaws torn open. Many more appeared to have been crushed in the press of bodies. Best guess, there was a wave of panicked people rushing upstairs from below, colliding with a wave of others fleeing down from above.\n\nWhy this staircase? What was near this part of the ship?\n\n*The cabaret lounge*, I realized. No electricity. No elevators. This was the nearest stairwell to the auditorium.\n\nCloser. I was inching closer to uncovering the fates of the passengers. And yet, I still had no idea *what* the passengers were fleeing from. Who were the attackers? Or\u2026 I thought of the eyeball. The glass chewed and swallowed.\n\nAn icy pinprick at the base of my skull whispered the question I didn\u2019t want to ask\u2026\n\n*Why? Why did some of the passengers go mad, and do it to themselves?*\n\n**Piano Bar**\n\nI took the long way round to the cabaret theatre, going all the way back up the stairs and coming down on the central staircase, only to detour on hearing the notes of a piano. I found myself in a cozy lounge and spotted a purple-haired figure at the keys. And just in time\u2014the ship was due to depart in less than half an hour!\n\n\u201cLily!\u201d I rushed over.\n\nThe musician\u2019s face lit. \u201cOh it\u2019s you, friend! You made it!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get off the ship!\u201d\n\n\u201cOff the\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know it seems crazy but you\u2019ve *got* to! Everyone on board is going to die\u2014I\u2019ve seen it because I\u2019m *psycho*!\u201d I heard it a second later and smacked my forehead. \u201cI mean\u2014*psychic!* PSYCHIC!! I can see the future.\u201d At her scrunched eyebrows, I burst, \u201cLook I know how I sound, but I\u2019ve been able to see things since I was a little girl, and I am telling you that this ship is going to go *dark!* The engines will *cut out!* People are going to flee and trample each other on that forward staircase\u2026\u201d Launching into a rapid-fire recounting, I was just getting to the eyeball in the teacup when she interrupted:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of some sort of terrorist attack?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no! No! It\u2019s almost like\u2026 a kind of madness, a *contagion*, that spreads through the ship\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA zombie apocalypse?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot zombies\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cPoltergeists? Possession?\u201d She played a riff from a horror movie. \u201cShould we call an exorcist?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should *leave*!\u201d I checked my phone. \u201cQuickly!\u2014\"\n\n\u201cWhat an odd duck you are! I can\u2019t imagine any sort of catastrophe as big as you\u2019re saying. You know this ship has *tons* of safety protocols. And even if I did believe some disaster were drawing near\u2014do you really think I could abandon crowds and crew?\u201d She looked at me over her glasses, shimmering purple lips curving in a smile. \u201cListen friend, if this were the Titanic and I was the only one who could see the iceberg, I\u2019d *stay* to steer us right, not run off leaving everyone to die!\u201d\n\nIcy fingers raked along my spine. Even if she wasn\u2019t taking me seriously, she was right\u2014I *did* have a moral obligation to save people. An obligation I\u2019d been trying to fulfill ever since I was a little girl, until the attempt killed my brother, and even after, I kept trying for years and years\u2026. until at last I realized that there *is no way* to change anything. That is why I call myself Cassandra. For the Greek prophet doomed to predict the future but never be believed. Try and prevent what I\u2019ve foreseen? You might as well try and pluck the stars from the sky!\n\nEvery hand I\u2019d touched was *cold*. Everyone on board would *die*.\n\nMy fists balled, fingernails digging so hard into my palms they bled. \u201cYou really have no idea what you\u2019re asking of me\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not telling *you* to stay. I\u2019m just explaining why *I* have to. Besides, I\u2019m under contract.\u201d She winked and focused on her playing as guests entered and sat at nearby tables.\n\nShe had no idea! None whatsoever! If I thought there was even a *sliver* of a hope, I wouldn\u2019t abandon people! Oh, if this happy-go-lucky musician understood the futility!!\n\n*But she will*, came another, darker thought. *She* will *know the full depth of the horror coming\u2026*\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered.\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d She shouted, \u201cWait\u2014friend, where are you going?\u201d\n\nBut I was not listening. The cabaret theatre\u2014was the answer there? The reason for the crush of bodies in the forward stairwell? I rushed past the cafe with the eyeball in the teacup, through the grand doors into the cabaret hall\u2014\n\n\u2014but the cabaret hall was surprisingly quiet, save for a light touch of classical music. A few passengers mingled here or there, unnoticing of the cadavers draped on chairs and tables.  The stage itself was pristine, the wood smooth and polished in the fading orange light through the windows. Apparently, the origin of the panicked flight up the forward stairwell was *not* this grand entertainment venue\u2014nothing here supported that theory.\n\nNonetheless, I gave the place a thorough search until my phone\u2019s battery ran low, and then I returned to the grand staircase.\n\nIn one direction lay passenger cabins. In the other, the gangplank back to the port terminal and safety.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too late to be a coward, Cass,\u201d I said. \u201cRun from the ship, run from the empty piano bench at the bar, find a different, cheaper hole in the wall to crawl into like\u2014like the cockroach you are\u2026\u201d\n\nAlways the survivor, eh\u2026?\n\nOr\u2026 or, I could try just *one more time.* *\u201c\u2018Hope,\u2019\u201d* my brother always said, *\u201cis the thing with feathers.\u201d*\n\n*And look what happened to him!* flashed through my mind. My heart slammed against my ribcage. I\u2019d just die too, unless I left in the next\u2014how many minutes? I checked my phone, but it was dead. Like I would be if I stayed.\n\nA horn sounded the Seastar\u2019s departure. A distant cheer rose up from the upper decks and balconies. I felt a brief panicky impulse to run back out on deck and throw myself off the ship\u2026 but in truth, my fate had already been decided *before* the ship\u2019s horn blew. I hadn\u2019t been paying attention earlier, but I\u2019d been rubbing and rubbing my hands, and finally realized they were *cold.* Probably had been since I\u2019d boarded. I shuffled leaden feet toward the passenger cabins, guided by my phone\u2019s light to the brass number plate for 4044\u2014*my* cabin. Reached for the knob and stopped.\n\nThat smell\u2014dread squeezed my intestines like a wet rag.\n\nSmoke. Burnt meat.\n\nI wrinkled my nose and opened the door.\n\nOrange rays shone through the window, the sunset so vivid it almost gave the illusion that the room was on fire. The walls and ceiling were charred. The edges of the mattress and sheets a smoldered ruin. But the worst damage was the small sofa by the coffee table. Broken bottles scattered round. And there on the sofa\u2014\n\nMy fingers went limp on the door handle as I stared into melted sockets of a body charred beyond recognition. A dark line encircled its wrist. The blackened remnants of a charm bracelet.\n\n*My* bracelet.\n\nWhile the man on the pool deck swallowed glass, I would succumb to the insanity here, dousing myself in alcohol and flame\u2014\n\n\u2014[immolating myself.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)\n\n[\\[Part 1\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/140khwa/i_went_on_a_cruise_and_all_the_passengers_were/)\n\n[\\[Part 3 UPDATE\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/144ahip/i_went_on_a_cruise_and_one_passenger_didnt_belong/)",

Better yet, said piano piece *came* to her, from somewhere outside herself, outside of us all, a medium through which something incomprehensible could be conveyed?",

I am writing this account partly in the hopes that if she survived, she might see it and tell me (though if she were to see it, all my comments about her bespelling me would be pretty embarrassing). But I... I don't think I need to fear that. She's likely dead. As for who is responsible for what happened to the Seastar... I know who it was, and I'm going to tell it next.",

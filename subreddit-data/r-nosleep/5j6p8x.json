    "postText": "My neighbor is one of those annoying wannabe YouTube personalities. Over the years, I\u2019ve seen him cough out cinnamon, lay flat on the hood of his car as it slowly creeps down the driveway, and douse himself in lukewarm water, all the while screaming *epic win*, *epic fail*, or, fuck, *epic maintenance of the status quo*, for all I know. It can get tiring to watch him go about his shenanigans in the pursuit of viral fame. So, when he knocked on my door the other day, told me he was going away for a few weeks, and asked that I get his mail, honestly, it was a relief. I can\u2019t explain the peace of mind I had knowing I didn\u2019t have to brace myself for any of his stupidity for a while. I was always afraid his stunts would wind up bleeding over into my life.\n\nThings were pretty normal for the first couple of days. He received a few bills, a bit of spam, and what I could only assume was a birthday card. Then, one evening, I got home to find a cardboard box waiting on his front porch. In big red letters was written \u201cReturn to Sender\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m no small fry, but I admit I had trouble lifting the box on my own. It was really freaking heavy. Lugging it across the road to my house was even harder, and I quickly realized there was no way I was going to drag it up the stairs and through my front door. I decided I\u2019d leave his package in my garage. It wasn\u2019t like I kept my car in there: the garage door was a piece of shit that refused to open without a good thug and a whack. It was less trouble just leaving the car in the driveway than it was to fight with the garage door every morning and night. In hindsight, I should have set the package down while I struggled to open the tricky door, but you know how it is when you\u2019ve got a good grip on something, no point in setting it down if you don\u2019t have to.\n\nIt was as I kicked the door for a third time that I lost my grip on the package, and it fell to the ground. I heard a light crack inside.\n\n\u201cShit,\u201d I cursed.\n\nI hoped I hadn\u2019t broken anything important, but figured I just wouldn\u2019t tell my neighbor about it and let him assume the break happened en-route.\n\nHands free, I finally managed to get the garage door unstuck, and boy did it screech in protest as it rolled up and over me. I dragged the box the rest of the way, setting it in the corner for whenever my neighbor would come back to claim it. And then, I forgot all about it. Until a few days passed, that is.\n\nI\u2019m not sure exactly how long it took for the smell to waft in from the crack under the garage-to-house door, but it came in in slow progression. It was a sickly sweet odor similar to a skunk, and for the first few days after I smelled it, I genuinely assumed that\u2019s exactly what it was: roadkill that had left its mark on my house. It was only when I realized the scent was growing more intense instead of fading that I went looking for a source. That\u2019s when I opened the garage door, and that\u2019s when the odor knocked me back, holding my nose.\n\nThe culprit wasn\u2019t hard to identify. The only change in my garage was the box in the corner. I remember thinking it must have been one of those meat-of-the-month subscription boxes. The meat must have gone rancid from being left out of the fridge for so long. How much meat could have been in there for the box to have been so large and heavy? An entire freaking cow?\n\nI covered my nose as I approached the box, a pair of scissors in my hands. I probably wouldn\u2019t have needed them to open it, as it had become soggy enough at the bottom to poke through with a finger, but I wasn\u2019t about to poke my finger into spoiled meat juices. That soggy bottom was the reason I had to open the box in the first place. If I tried to drag it out whole, everything would spill onto the floor. I was going to have to dump the pieces of meat one garbage bag at a time, and take them down to the dumpster, a process I wasn\u2019t looking forward to.\n\nMy scissors tore through the tape along the top of the cardboard box. I thought the smell couldn\u2019t get any worse, but as I flipped the flaps open, I discovered a whole new gamut of stink. It was like opening a burning oven, but instead of a heat wave, I was met with waves of piss, sweat, shit, and putrefaction. It was so bad that I staggered back and had to force down the puke begging to guzzle out of me. I don\u2019t think I could have handled that scent mingling with the horrors coming out of the box. I\u2019m not ashamed to admit I ran out the door for a breath of fresh air, but in the short time I\u2019d spent in the garage, the smell had become so ingrained in the fabric of my clothes that it clung to me like a shadow.\n\nNothing I tried could keep the smell out of my nostrils. Not air fresheners, not a face mask, not three showers and a change of clothes. Every second that box lay open in my garage was another second the smell was allowed a foothold into my home. I had to bite the bullet.\n\nI returned to the garage, the flaps of the box still open as though inviting me to look. I was prepared, a clothespin pinning my nostrils shut, a garbage bag in one hand, the strongest cleaner I could find in the other, and long rubber gloves to keep my skin from having to touch what was inside. But, as it turns out, I needed none of those things.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have to touch or clean the contents of that box, I would only have to suffer the nightmares every night. You see, there was meat in that box, but it didn\u2019t come from a cow or a pig. No, it was worse than that. It was my neighbor. Dead. Still in one piece, but dead.\n\nI called the cops, and naturally, they took me in for interrogation. It\u2019s kind of hard *not* to suspect the man with a corpse in his garage, after all. Thankfully, they soon realized I wasn\u2019t involved. My DNA might have been all over that box, the smell might have left a mark throughout my house, but there was one piece of irrefutable evidence in my neighbor\u2019s own hands that proved my innocence: a vlogging camera.\n\nThey showed me the footage only once. I\u2019m not sure if they were allowed to, or if they felt so bad for me they figured it couldn\u2019t hurt. Either way, I saw it.\n\nMy neighbor was sitting in the box outside of a shipping facility, laughing as he told the world how he was going to mail himself across state lines. He\u2019d brought pee bottles, food, a pillow, and a few flashlights. His friend \u2013 a guy I\u2019d seen at his place several times to help with his stunts \u2013, closed the lid and presumably dropped him off for shipment. Throughout the next couple of hours\u2026or days, I\u2019m honestly not sure, my neighbor recorded a few short clips about his progress. \u2018I think I\u2019m in a truck now, I can feel it moving\u2019, \u2018Must be in a warehouse. Pretty warm here. Still got plenty of food!\u2019, that kind of stuff. And then, on the last entry, the box toppled over. He broke his neck, and that was it. The camera recorded until either the memory card got too full, or the battery died.\n\nThere\u2019s one thing I didn\u2019t tell the police after they showed me the video. One thing I heard in the footage that will haunt me to the day I die. Just after the tumble that broke his neck, I heard the familiar screeching sound of *my* garage door.\n\n***\n[ML](https://www.facebook.com/lyset.manen)",

I heard a faint crack and I thought, \"I hope I didn't break eggs or something. Mom'll be pissed.\"\n\nShe sobbed when I opened the present and the handle had snapped off. She assumed she broke it. I told her it wasn't her fault, it must have got crushed in the car. Yeah, I'm a horrible person, and I've never forgiven myself for breaking that beautiful, hand-painted antique. (I did eventually confess that I broke it, years later.)\n\nAll that said, I guess I'm just trying to say I kind of understand where you're coming from, OP. But it was really your idiot neighbor's fault. I think it's actually a pretty serious crime to try to mail yourself, for the very reason illustrated here: it puts all the people handling the package at risk for negligence, up to and including negligent homicide.",

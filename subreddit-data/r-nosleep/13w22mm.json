    "postText": "Nettie Peterson has known me at my best and at my worst, and after everything that's happened lately, I think I can finally say the same. I'm admittedly not very good at comforting her, though. I haven't had much practice, is all. Historically speaking, she's always been the one to take care of me. My introduction to earth was a confusing, horrifying time for me, and she had dealt with all of it. She'd handled every panic attack, brought me back from every low. When I woke up one night to a drilling pain in my stomach and blood soaking my panties, she managed to keep me calm while explaining that this would now happen every month. \n\nWhat I'm saying is that the woman is insanely skilled. \n\nMe, not so much. After we had gotten out of the cave, I tried to provide emotional support by petting her hair and talking soothingly. Seeing as I was also distressed, she was doing the same to me, so we were basically sitting on the beach holding each other. To the outside observer, we must have looked rather strange. I was relieved to finally get back to her house. We sat down in front of the TV and ate cupcakes. We have a special system for eating cupcakes. I peel off the frosting and give her rest. It's messy and I have to keep hand wipes nearby everytime, but it's how we do it. We both eat cupcakes whole when we're by ourselves, so it doesn't make much sense either, but when we share, it's always like this. \n\nOnce I was sure she was alright, I left her to go off to bed while I made my way back to the hotel, bracing myself for what I expected to be an extremely uncomfortable conversation. \n\nThe lobby was dim and quiet. The large, bright ceiling lights had been turned off with only a couple floor lamps illuminating the hall. I walked past the unmanned reception desk and up the stairs, then rapped my knuckles against the door to Frankie's room. After a couple seconds, he opened up. Upon meeting my gaze, he let out a soft gasp, but it wasn't followed by a smile this time. He made way for me to step inside, wordlessly, and I entered without breaking the silence. I sat down on the sofa where he joined me after placing a glass of coconut water in front of me. \n\nFor a beat, we both stared at the drink. I didn't take it. \n\n\"What you did felt really off earlier,\" I began. \"You were trying to embarrass Nettie. If you were testing your boundaries, if you were trying to see how I'd react, you got your answer. Don't ever make me choose between you two. You'll lose.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said quietly.\n\n\"If you don't get along with Nettie, that's one thing. You don't need to. But she was needling you and you made a real effort to be cruel.\" I paused. \"You act so strange sometimes. All bossy and cagey.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he repeated, briefly falling silent as he worked away on his gum in slow, contemplative motions. \"I'm sorry. I don't know why I did it. I wanted to unsettle her. It's not that I don't like her, she's fine, but at that moment, I simply loathed her. I couldn't tell you why. But I wish I'd kept quiet. I feel gross for spouting off like that.\"\n\n\"Then\u2026 why?\"\n\n\"I don't know! There's this weird feeling, it comes over me and makes me remember stuff that's in the past\u2026 Then I get caught up and confused. I run my mouth, but I don't want to make you upset. I swear I won't do it again. I'll rein myself in.\"\n\n\"Will you? This doesn't seem right.\" I took a deep breath. \"Frankie, I have no idea what you are. Even though you know everything about me.\"\n\n\"Not everything,\" he argued. \"You never said a thing about what life was like where you're from. Or who you were before. Yes, that's not what this is about, but I'm just speaking technically.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't have to rely on technicalities to make a point.\"\n\n\"No. Look, I keep wondering what I'm even doing here. I like you a lot. But I haven't thought this through and by now, I'm scared to.\"\n\n\"Stop talking in riddles,\" I implored him.\n\nHe huffed out a chuckle. \"I'd have to stop thinking in them first.\" Before he could add anything else, his phone started vibrating on the TV table. \"Oh, dammit,\" he muttered. Shooting me an uncertain gaze, he reached out for it, his hand hovering above the screen. \"Can I?\"\n\n\"Sure.\" I let go of a long breath, snatched up the glass and leaned back in my seat as Frankie answered the call. I pick up on a woman's voice talking on the other end. \n\nHe kept glancing over at me almost sheepishly as he mumbled words of affirmation into the phone. \"Yes\u2026 Yeah, I remember\u2026 Well, it's not a *good* time, but I'll do it. Bye.\" Dropping the device into his lap, he gave me a twist of the mouth. \"That was Mae-Lynn. She works at\u2014\"\n\n\"The diner with you,\" I cut him off. \"I do take note of the other staff there, for your information.\" I took a sip of my water. \"Occasionally.\"\n\n\"I promised to do some shopping for her. She's come down with the flu. Store's closing soon, though, so I'll have to go now.\"\n\n\"Well, that's convenient.\"\n\n\"I was going to ask you to come along.\"\n\nI agreed. Having lost track of the conversation, the drive was a grim, quiet affair. Frankie took us to one of the more expensive stores in the area, saying that he wanted to treat Mae-Lynn. \n\n\"Take a cart,\" I ordered, and once he had acquired one, I had him hold it still while I climbed inside. He regarded me with a bemused expression but refrained from commenting as he began to roll me down the aisles. \n\nGrocery shopping at night is something else. Eighties music was playing over the radio at a low volume, but the otherwise quiet space made it sound decidedly louder. There was almost the hint of an echo. Safe for two of three singular, tired-looking individuals, Frankie and I were the only people in the store. I had nestled against the back of the cart, my head tipped back to watch Fran's face from below as his eyes roamed the shelves. Occasionally, he'd stop to check the list Mae-Lynn had texted him on his phone. \n\n\"If you want anything, speak up,\" he told me. \n\n\"I'm out of cereal,\" I said, just as we passed the respective aisle. He turned the cart back around, let me pick out a carton of cornflakes and took up walking again. After five minutes of stoically regarding him from my mobile vantage point, I piped up again. \"Go back. Wrong ones.\"\n\n\"Well, which ones do you want? I'll get them, it's faster than pushing this thing around.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No, no, I have to look at them. Go back.\"\n\nHe shook his head to himself but obediently maneuvered the cart back to the shelf with the breakfast items. I took my time picking out a different box, then settled back down. \n\n\"Happy?\" Fran asked.\n\n\"Delighted.\"\n\nAfter fifteen minutes, we were getting close to finishing Mae-Lynn's list. Frankie was starting to move towards the cash register, only for me to tug on his arm. \"Turn back,\" I told him, holding up the box. \"I don't want them after all. I need different ones.\" \n\nHe stifled a groan. \"Sure, Sunshine.\" I let him roll me all the way back to the cereal aisle where I studied the colorful boxes intensely. \"Nevermind,\" I said, turning back to him. \"Let's go.\"\n\nHe started making his way over to the register again when I cleared my throat. \"Actually, I think I might have another look.\"\n\n\"Are you kidding me?\" he squeaked, only for me to hold his gaze with a smile. \"You are,\" he choked out. \"I oughta send you rolling right into that stack of cans.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't dare.\"\n\n\"Is that a challenge?\" He glanced about himself, finding that we were alone. Then, he pushed the cart, and it swerved, sliding across the shiny floor. The thrill of the launch washed over me and I started laughing. He lunged for it, grabbing it just in time to prevent the collision. \n\n\"Do it again!\" I demanded.\n\nHe indulged me, sending me swerving and spinning a couple more times. Eventually, he took a running start and pushed me down a long, empty aisle at a breakneck speed. The giggles died in my throat when, seemingly out of thin air, someone appeared at the end of the aisle. My jaw dropped and I reflexively gripped the sides of the cart to protect myself from the impending crash, but the person simply reached out and caught the cart by its edges. Within the blink of an eye, they had managed to steady it. My vehicle had come to a standstill. It all happened incredibly fast, and for a moment, I found myself unable to react. One of the other person's hands had come to rest over mine in the process. Still at a loss for words, I raised my head to meet their gaze.\n\n*Those eyes.*\n\nMy heart, already thundering in my chest, dropped entirely into my stomach. There were pupils filling the void in that formerly uninterrupted pale vastness this time, but I recognized them either way. Seeing them sit in an actual face instead of behind a nondescript black mask was strange, but there was not a doubt in my mind. It was them.\n\nThe cultist had jarringly pleasant features that struck me as neither overtly feminine nor masculine. Their tawny skin had an almost bronze sheen to it and short locks of platinum blond hair stuck to their smooth forehead, slick with the same sweat that formed stains beneath the armpits of their light gray t-shirt. \n\nIt was like time stood still. The interaction could not have been longer than two seconds in total, but it felt like a full hour. From me staring at our linked hands, to locking eyes with them, to the cold, raw realization, it seemed to me as though forty minutes or more had gone by, followed by another twenty when I watched the crude smile forming on their lips. Their fingers clamped down on my own, and before I knew it, *it had happened.*\n\nThe lights in the store had changed color, taking on a dimmer, sickly green tint. The shelves around us had emptied and the gentle, melodic hum of the radio had been replaced by a deep, droning buzz of static. I was still sitting in the shopping cart, and the cultist was still leaning over me, but their expression had morphed into one of shocked disbelief. Seeing fear on the face of the person who'd stabbed me might have been a great satisfaction to me in any other situation, but right then and there, I was equally as terrified. \n\nI had switched dimensions and was now alone with my attempted murderer. \n\nThe thought took a while to sink in, but the clearer it became, the more I felt the need to scream. And yet, not a sound left my lips. My own saliva had turned sour, filling my mouth with an acidic taste. Dread pooled in the pit of my stomach like icy, chilled water and tears were stringing the corners of my eyes. I blinked them away in a hurry, redirecting my gaze at the cultist. They were staring past me in a daze, taking in our changed surroundings before fixing me with a sharp glare.\n\n\"Seriously?\"\n\n\"What?\" The word somehow slipped past the lump in my throat.\n\nThe cultist made a sweeping gesture at our surroundings. \"Where are we? What the hell is this? You don't even have your dimension hopping under control? Not gonna lie, I had higher expectations of you.\"\n\n\"What?\" I repeated eloquently.\n\n\"You just switched dimensions on my ass. And seeing as you literally *crashed into me*, I don't think you planned on doing that.\"\n\n\"I didn't,\" I confirmed.\n\n\"That's what I'm talking about.\" \n\n\"You know about dimensions?\" \n\nThe cultist palmed their face, emitting a deep, low groan. \"Clearly.\"\n\nI scrambled back in the cart, trying to bring some distance between the two of us. I bared my teeth at them, both rows elongating and curving outward. At least I was getting the hang of my physical transformation. \"If you come any closer, I'll rip your hand off,\" I hissed, spittle flying out between my fangs. \n\n\"I believe you,\" they replied, narrowing their eyes at me. \"I'm not gonna hurt you.\"\n\n\"That's hard for me to believe.\"\n\n\"Yes, sure. I did and I would again, but not here. Not now. You understand?\" they asked pointedly, their voice cutting like a razor blade.\n\n\"I'm not sure I do.\"\n\n\"Well, without you, I won't get out of here, and I've stuff to do on the other side.\" They stepped behind the cart and grabbed onto the handle. \n\nI hastily twisted around to face them. \"You know about the finer details of dimension hopping but you can't do it yourself?\"\n\nThey let out a soft sigh as they began pushing the cart, with me inside, down the empty aisle. \"I managed to do it once. Just once. Never again. It's not a great surprise to me that you should be able to switch to the other sides, but I'd thought you'd be able to control it. I think I have your number. I'm pretty sure I know what you are, and we have more in common than you could have probably guessed. That boy you were with on the other hand\u2026 I won't lie, he freaks me out. He's got the strangest face and he didn't react to my eyes at all.\"\n\n\"What are you?\" I queried, quick to steer him away from the topic of Frankie Preston even though I didn't really expect an honest answer. \"How'd you do that the other night? Your\u2026 your eye thing?\"\n\n\"That unsettled you, didn't it? It's not anything I *do* per se.\" They shrugged leisurely. \"I could just as well ask you where you're hiding your tentacles.\"\n\n\"So you're not human. I didn't think you were,\" I stated. \"What's your business with the Collective? What are you after? Are any of you normal people?\"\n\n\"As far as I know, I'm the only one who's not.\" They steered the cart around the corner with a swift, forcible yank and I bumped painfully against the side of the cart. Stifling a yelp, I kept my face straight, looking over the shelves as we passed them. I noticed that some of them weren't entirely empty\u2014there were a couple jars, cans and bags of various goods standing scattered throughout. They looked almost lonely. The cultist, registering my wandering gaze, stopped and grabbed a random plastic jar that looked like it could be containing peanut butter or something of the sort. The label was faded and partially peeled off. They inspected it from all sides before thrusting it into my hands. \"Here, open it,\" they commanded. \n\n\"I certainly won't,\" I replied, a mix of rage and apprehension bubbling in my chest.\n\n\"Aren't you curious?\"\n\n\"No. But if you are, go on and open it yourself.\"\n\nThey grunted, grabbing the jar and unscrewing the red lid. They dropped it to the floor where it bounced off once and rolled away into the darkness. Peering in, their expression remained unchanged. \"Nothing. Look.\" They held it out to me and sure enough, it was empty. I let them hand it to me, intrigue winning me over as I started examining the small container. It was completely unremarkable. I reached two of my fingers inside only for the digits to suddenly be stricken with a searing pain. It flashed through my bones like lightning and I cried out, withdrawing my hand. Suddenly, the floor seemed to quiver. The lights in the store flickered, seeming startlingly bright for a split second only to turn dimly green once more. The cultist let out an involuntary shriek, staggering back before managing to steady themself as everything went back to its former solid state.\n\n\"What the fuck was that?\" they wheezed.\n\n\"An earthquake?\" I suggested, not quite knowing what else to say. My pulse was thrumming in my ears, hard enough to split my head in half. It took me a minute to regain a relative state of calm.\n\n\"An earthquake? In another dimension? You're messing with me.\"\n\n\"I don't know! Maybe it was\u2026 maybe I was nearly jumping back, I have no idea.\" I shook my head, ignoring the throbbing pain shooting through my temples. \"I don't have it all figured out yet, but it's an emotional response. Whenever my flight instinct gets triggered, these dimension switches happen. It was the jar. The jar is painful inside.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" they asked, eagerly reaching for the jar and sticking their pinky finger into it. They pulled it back out with a howl, letting the jar drop to the floor. \"What the hell is up with this place?\"\n\n\"How would I know?\" I argued hotly. \n\n\"Yeah, well. Anyways.\" All of a sudden, their hand was in my hair, tugging on my braid. They yanked my head to the side, and before I could break out my tentacles or try to snap my jaws at them, I could feel their hot breath on my nape. A scream died in my throat, equal parts painful and shocked. My eyes burned, my vision swimming when the cultist dragged their teeth across my skin, leaving a trail of warm saliva. And then, fast and without mercy, they bit down. \n\nThe lights turned bright white. The static buzzing that had been hanging in the stale air changed to the familiar eighties music tunes. Squinting into the sudden brightness, the colors of the countless types of packaged products filling the shelves almost seemed to be screaming at me. \n\n*We were back.*\n\nThe cultist disentangled themself, quickly stepping away from me. I looked up, still dazed, to see why. Frankie Preston had come up behind us, snatching the cart away from the other person and pulling it out of their reach. I immediately scrambled up to wrap my arms around him. \"That's them,\" I breathed. \"From the Collective.\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said tonelessly. His eyes, trained on the blonde, spelled murder. \"You should get out of here,\" he added, addressing them. \"The shelves here are rickety, they might fall on you.\"\n\nThe cultist's expression was a frozen mix of suppressed uncertainty and confusion. Still, they held the server's gaze. \"You should maybe not\u2026 do anything stupid,\" they uttered, their voice almost equally as flat as his. \n\n\"I'm all about stupid.\"\n\n\"Then I guess I ought to leave. See you guys soon. It was a pleasure.\" They threw us a smile that was faker than Frankie's when he waited tables before marching off, leaving the two of us alone in the aisle. \n\n\"Are you alright?\" Fran asked, running a hand over my mussed braid. \"What happened? I'm so\u2026 one minute you were here and the next\u2026\"\n\n\"We switched dimensions.\"\n\n\"I pieced that together. You weren't gone for long\u2026 just a couple minutes.\" He nervously twisted his wet bubble gum around the tip of his finger, drawing nervous strings. \n\n\"Were you worried?\" \n\n\"Out of my mind,\" he said in a low voice, not meeting my gaze. \"I mean, I knew you'd be okay on your own, I wasn't saying that\u2014\"\n\n\"I wasn't. I'm not,\" I interrupted him. \"I got out alright, sure I did, but I'm not okay right now.\" I swallowed. My throat was bone dry. \"I need to call Mary Markov. She should hear about this.\"\n\nFrankie nodded along. \"Do you want me to do it for you? I'm certain I can give her an accurate description.\"\n\nI declined and sat back in the cart. Per my request, Fran brought me home after we'd paid for everything. I needed some time alone to relax and pretend everything was normal. I cleaned my room and then looked through job listings, which I admittedly haven't done in a little while. When I couldn't find any other way to procrastinate, I made the call to Mary Markov, which went about as well as could be expected. She wants to see me tomorrow, though. I wish she'd told me about what. For a newsreader, she's really not very forward with her information.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13dr5g0/help_im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[2: deadbeat roommate](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13eovqy/im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_also_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[3: creepy crush](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13fnc4u/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_everyone/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[4: relocation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13gjpwd/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_does_anybody/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[5: beach concert](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13heih5/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[6: First date](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ib2es/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_my_first/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[7: Temp work](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ja7jx/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_temp_work/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[8: roommate talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13k8088/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_a_talk_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[9: a dismal worldview](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13l69a9/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_the_world/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[10: warehouse](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13m8e9w/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[11: staircase](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13o0npw/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_we_visited_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[12: explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13p2dw3/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_we_might/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[13: hurt](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13q2hrx/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_i_should_not/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[14: hospital](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13r0f31/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_i_dont_like/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[15: ocean](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13s762l/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_the_day_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[16: diner](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13t8gny/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_i_may_have/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[17: government work](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13u20f7/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_so_this_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[18: something in the caves](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ux5n8/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_theres/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[20: olms and Jewels](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13x0lkh/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_olms_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

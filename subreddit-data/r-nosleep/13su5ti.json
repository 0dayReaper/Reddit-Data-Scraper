    "postText": "It was a late summer night, definitely past curfew, and I was hiding behind a large, twisted tree next to a dilapidated tombstone. I was about fifteen at the time and still relatively afraid of the dark, but I didn\u2019t want to show any fear around my older brothers\u2019 friends. You see, we were all playing \u2018Ghost in the Graveyard\u2019. If you\u2019ve never played this creepy children\u2019s game, it\u2019s basically like hide and go seek tag in the dark. Usually contestants play it in their own backyard, but we decided to spice it up a bit and head to an actual graveyard. This graveyard was about two miles from our house and posed as the perfect venue for our activities.  \n\nThis time, Kent was the \u201cghost\u201d. His job was to find us and stop us from reaching the base, which in this case, was the gate to the graveyard. Kent was a character. He was the MVP of his soccer team, voted most-likely to succeed, about to graduate with honors, but man, was he a pig. I loved him, but he was a total pig and everyone who knew him wouldn\u2019t disagree. He really just had no filter and had developed a strong reputation throughout the years for speaking out-of-turn a little too often. \n\n\u201cGotcha!\u201d My heart dropped as Kent grabbed my arm and pulled me to the ground. He found me. I was bummed. \n\n\u201cAm I your first victim?\u201d I whined. \u201cI thought this was a good spot, too!\u201d \n\n\u201cNice try, Grace\u2026 just kidding! That sucked! Worst spot ever!\u201d He laughed, loudly. \n\nI was annoyed, but I could hear his friends snickering in the distance in their own shitty hiding spots. I giggled as he took off. \n\n\u201c1, 2, Kent is coming for you\u2026\u201d He terrorized in a melodic tone. \n\nJust then, I heard someone scream hysterically, but it was followed by a bunch of laughter. Kent was chasing after this goth girl that had come along. She clearly didn\u2019t fit into the group, as most of Kent\u2019s friends were total jocks, but this was his best friend\u2019s new girlfriend. Her name was Samara. I heard that she used to practice witchcraft at lunch and do tarot readings for her friends during assemblies. As weird as that all was though, she seemed fairly sweet and happened to be the only one that actually acknowledged me when we arrived earlier that night. I had nothing bad to say about her. \n\nFinally, Kent tagged her, but not before yelling something so unnecessary that even my eyes widened. \n\n\u201cPromise not to perform a hex on me?\u201d He chortled and then smacked her back, attempting to tag her, but actually just forcing her off balance. She hit the ground and looked up at him. \n\n\u201cYou better watch your tongue.\u201d She snapped. \n\n\u201cOkay, okay that\u2019s enough.\u201d Samara\u2019s boyfriend came out of his hiding place and helped her up. \n\n\u201cWhat? It was a joke.\u201d He reassured, but you could tell he was still laughing. \n\n\u201cAlright, fun\u2019s over.\u201d His other friend stepped out from behind a rose bush and grabbed a blue backpack from the grass. \u201cLet\u2019s go. It\u2019s getting late anyway.\u201d \n\nI knew this was going to happen. He always pushed the envelope a little too far. With everything. \n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my flippin\u2019 soccer ball?\u201d Kent asked. \u201cI had it earlier.\u201d  \n\n\u201cDude, I\u2019m sorry, but I got to go. I can help you look for your ball tomorrow, but it\u2019s too dark and there\u2019s like no moon tonight.\u201d His friend apologized.  \n\n\u201cJust go. I\u2019ll make Grace look with me.\u201d He pinched my arm, playfully. \n\nHis friends hopped on their bikes and began peddling down a shortcut through the woods. About ten minutes went by. I was pretty tired at this point and really didn\u2019t feel like looking for my stupid brother\u2019s soccer ball anymore, but it was his prized possession and there was no way he was leaving without it. I certainly couldn\u2019t leave without him. I was just an innocent young girl and we lived in an area in the country with lots of crime. It was also extraordinarily dark and we were still about two miles from home. Literally the only amenities in the immediate area were a church, a graveyard, and a desolate cornfield.  \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll start scrounging through this ditch. I can barely see, but it\u2019s worth a shot!\u201d He yelled. \u201cYou just wait right there.\u201d \n\nHe could tell I was becoming antsy as I glanced back at the long, quiet road in anticipation of our future-trek. I could see porch lights to houses all the way at the end, but just barely. The rest of the road was absolutely barren. I felt shivers go down my spine as a gust of wind blew in. It smelled\u2026 sweet. Strangely sweet.  \n\nThen it began. It started off very, very quiet. \n\n\u201cI think I found it!\u201d He yelled. \u201cNever mind, it\u2019s a weird decorative bowling ball. Who decorates a tombstone with a bowling ball?\u201d He snarked. \n\n\u201cHey, Kent. You hear that?\u201d I yelled over the trench-like ditch. \n\nHis head popped out.  \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He shouted back, annoyed. You could tell he thought he was on the right track to finding that dumb soccer ball.  \n\n\u201cWhat? What?\u201d He started gesturing with his hand for me to explain my disruption. Then, as if something had snapped in his spine, his gait straightened entirely. His posture was immaculate, his eyes dilated to the size of his irises, and he turned his head to face the sound he so obviously heard now. \n\nIt was the sound of a very eerie, slow ice cream truck. It was tinkering its way down the asphalt directly towards us. Something felt very off. Why was there an ice cream truck out this late? Why was it driving this slowly past a graveyard? More importantly though, why was my brother walking towards it? \n\nThis ice cream truck did not seem friendly, yet he seemed drawn to it like a moth to a flame. The music emitting from this vehicle sounded like the melody of an ice cream truck, but it also sounded as if it were coming through distorted speakers. It appeared to be disguised in bright colorful lights to cover up its rusted, worn exterior. Had this vehicle just been rescued from a junkyard?  \n\n\u201cKent! Stop! What are you doing?!\u201d I begged, pulling on his sleeve, but he just ignored my pleading and kept on his merry way. \n\nThe ice cream truck finally came to a slow screeching halt directly in front of the graveyard gate. I stood back a good distance and observed as my brother swooned at a beautiful young woman in the driver\u2019s seat. \n\n\u201cHello,\u201d she began, \u201cWould you like to try one of our new flavors?\u201d \n\nI felt very uneasy now. This was not normal. Anyone in their right mind would be questioning the intentions of this late-night ice cream truck driver, but not Kent. He was at that age though, you know, where his eyes were constantly glued on female counterparts. \n\n\u201cYes, please.\u201d He said, elated. \n\nI rolled my eyes. \n\nShe turned around and began scooping something from a large tub, then finishing up, she handed him a tall cranberry red ice cream cone.  \n\n\u201cThis one\u2019s my favorite.\u201d She smiled. \u201cAnd for you?\u201d She fixated her eyes on me. It felt like she was looking into my soul, like she could hear my thoughts. Her eyes looked completely black, like there were no whites to her eyes. I wondered if Kent noticed this as well. \n\nI stammered, \u201cUh, I\u2019m good, thanks!\u201d  \n\nShe backed away from the window of her truck and my brother yelled, \u201cHow much do I owe you?\u201d \n\n\u201cThat one\u2019s on the house.\u201d She smirked and put the truck in gear. She hit a button by the steering wheel and the music began playing very eerily again. She smiled and waved as she pulled away, but I noticed something strange in her smile. Her teeth almost appeared to be a golden brown, like little roasted mini-marshmallows. I quickly shook off the discomfort and turned to my brother. \n\n\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have your soccer ball, but you do have some weird random ice cream.\u201d I patted his back as he went in for his first lick. \n\nHis tongue scraped up against the scoop of red ice cream, his eyes rolled back in his head, and immediately, he began screaming. I didn\u2019t know what was going on. \n\n\u201cWhat? What?! Are you okay?!\u201d I stammered, grabbing onto his arm. \n\nThe ice cream seemed as if it had been sewn to his tongue. He began pulling the ice cream off of his tongue, gripping the cone tight, but it just wouldn\u2019t budge. At this point, I began panicking too. I glanced down the road in the distance and found that the creepy ice cream truck from moments before had somehow completely disappeared. It wasn\u2019t driving fast and the road was a straight-away, so it was quite odd we couldn\u2019t even see it in the distance anymore. \n\n\u201cJust relax. Everything\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d I reassured him. Then he looked at me with tears in his eyes and almost impulsively proceeded to rip the ice cream out of his mouth. Unfortunately, this plan didn\u2019t seem to be optimal, as with it came the whole top half of his tongue. \n\n\u201cNo!\u201d I yelled, but it was too late. He had succeeded in removing the ice cream from his tongue, but blood was now dripping from his mouth. You could see the inside of his tongue stuck to this ball of red goo and could barely make out where the ice cream started and his tongue ended. I took a step back in shock. At this point, Kent\u2019s whole body went limp as he hit the grass. I tried to catch him, shaking in fear, but he was a very big guy.  \n\nQuestions and fears began filling my mind. Where did that truck driver go? Who was she and what did she feed my brother? Why was she out this late? \n\nI got down in the grass and began vigorously rubbing Kent\u2019s shoulders. \n\n\u201cWake up! Kent, please! I need you right now! Please be okay!\u201d I begged, hysterically. \n\nI didn\u2019t give up though. Mustering the energy to pull his torso upright, I began patting his back, incessantly. I felt the blood from his lips dripping onto my collar bone as I was holding him, but I could barely see anything through my tears. Glancing around, I noticed the suspiciously red ice cream cone, but it was now melted all over the dirt path.  \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d I mumbled through my weeps, \u201cjust relax.\u201d Honestly, at this point, I think I was actually just trying to calm myself down. \n\nFinally, after about five minutes of sincerely devastating pleading, he came to. I was really losing hope there to be honest and was so relieved, I didn\u2019t even know what to do with myself. He looked up at me and tried to say something, then realized his tongue was still partially gone and almost passed out again. I had to talk him through this moment. You could tell he wanted to sob, but it hurt too badly. \n\n\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go.\u201d I helped him up, but he kept his head down. Not only do I believe he was absolutely sickened by the hanging flesh in his mouth, but he also seemed emotionally defeated. \n\nWe started our way down that long, black road to home. The porch lights in the distance were still bright with tiny lights. I could hear Kent whimpering between each step, but I desperately wanted to get home. It still felt unsafe, like something bizarre was out, waiting for us, watching for us. \n\nJust as we were passing the church, I began to hear the faint ringing of ice cream truck music again. My heart sank into my throat. We were still about a mile away from home. I swallowed deeply and looked at Kent. He looked at me and, in unison, we grabbed each other\u2019s hands and began sprinting down the road with no words exchanged. Bugs were buzzing past my ears as we made our way under a bright street lamp and zipped through a 4-way intersection. I could hear the music following us, but we were both too afraid to look back. We hung a left and were now facing our old, little home. \n\nWe barged our way inside, panting and covered in sweat, glanced at the clock, and noticed it was midnight. For some, getting back this late wouldn\u2019t matter too much, but for us, this was bad news bears and we knew it. I turned around and immediately locked the door. Kent peered through the blinds, looked at me, and shook his head, indicating they were gone. \n\n\u201cWho is it?!\u201d My dad bolted in the kitchen with a SPAS-12.  \n\nMy brother and I were still leaning up against the door, breathing heavily in fear. My dad immediately saw the blood on Kent\u2019s shirt and called our mom in. \n\n\u201cCheryl! Come look at this!\u201d He yelled, desperately. \n\nMy mother came out in a moo-moo with tight hair rollers in.  \n\n\u201cOh my gosh! Honey! What happened?!\u201d She cried in fear. \n\nMy brother tried to answer, but half his tongue was still missing and somewhere out on the pavement with that melted ice cream, but how could I tell my mother that? She\u2019d never believe me. \n\n\u201cI- wa- ah-...\u201c Kent tried muttering the explanation out, but he just couldn\u2019t form the words. He teared up, as trying to pronounce any consonant hurt him. \n\nMy mother turned to me at this point and started shaking my shoulders. \u201cWhat happened to my son?!\u201d  \n\nI stopped her and started spilling the beans. I told them everything. \n\n\u201cWho told you to say all this?\u201d My mother started, \u201cI bet it was those bad eggs he\u2019s been hanging out with! Who did this to him?!\u201d  \n\nShe didn\u2019t believe me.  \n\nMy dad jumped in, \u201cThat sounds like the legend of the Cold Stone Witch.\u201d \n\nMy mom was not happy with his ghostly acknowledgments and shouted, \u201cThat's an urban legend! It's not real!\u201d She finished, \u201cSomeone clearly played a prank on my poor baby!\u201d \n\n\u201cCold Stone Witch? Tell me more!\u201d I shouted.\n\n\u201cLegend has it that the Cold Stone Witch will come out after curfew and lure bad children in to teach them a lesson.\u201d My father replied, \u201cBut it\u2019s all just hocus pocus.\u201d \n\nWe all jammed in the car and sped to our small town\u2019s E.R. My mom took out a piece of paper and a pen and tried to get my brother to write down what had happened as she obviously didn\u2019t believe me. All he wrote was: \u2018She\u2019s telling the truth.\u2019 \n\nWhen we had taken him to the hospital that night, the doctors tried performing surgery on his tongue, but the muscles seemed to have developed atrophy almost immediately upon severance. He was unable to talk for a number of years and was even put through speech therapy to try to recover. I don\u2019t think he ever will though, not fully anyway.  \n\nDon\u2019t think he wasn\u2019t affected mentally by all of this either. He was distraught, never the same again. He used to have such a vibrant, carefree personality, but not anymore. He was now very quiet most of the time, even though he had learned to talk again with the limited amount of tongue he had left. He rarely expressed himself and seemed driven to long-term depression. \n\nI\u2019m sharing this experience here in hopes I can prevent this tragedy from happening to anyone else. I am thirty now and have three beautiful children. Some may say I have a chip on my shoulder, but, I do have three simple rules. \n\n1. I never allow my children to go out past curfew. \n\n2. They are not allowed to play \u2018Ghost in the Graveyard\u2019 anywhere, at any time. \n\n3. Ice cream trucks are absolutely forbidden, lest they wish to face the wrath of the Cold Stone Witch.",

    "postText": "I found something weird when checking the mail one particular morning.\n\nIt was a blank postcard.\n\nReally, I\u2019m not kidding you.\n\nWho just sends a blank postcard?! Makes no sense, right? \\*Hmph\\* They had the decency to write to \u201cyou\u201d\u2013 but the from line remained blank.\n\nI didn\u2019t recognize their handwriting at all.\n\nThere was no stamp. No address attached. No written message. Nothing.\n\nOn the front of the postcard, printed in stock bold lettering, it said \u201cThinking of you!\u201d\n\nWell, how sweet is that. Thanks \u2013 whoever you are \u2013 thinking of you too!\n\nBut now I kind of am. And I can\u2019t stop thinking about *You . . .*\n\nLater that evening, while lounging in my recliner, I heard a knock at the front door. When I went to answer, of course no one was there. How typical, I thought. First comes a creepy postcard in the mail and then some ghost knocking at my door. What\u2019s next?! I shrugged it off, no sense in getting spooked over nothing.\n\nI closed the door and returned to my chair. After some time, I fell asleep.\n\nIn the dead of the night, my phone woke me. I remember groggily reaching for the little beam of light on the armrest, wondering who in their right mind would call at such an hour.\n\nI remember wishing I hadn\u2019t, because the caller ID said, \u201cThinking of you!\u201d\n\nI remember not answering as I threw my phone clear down the hall.\n\nI remember that it was You who ferociously tossed it back.\n\nI remember staring at the ceiling, counting the seconds till sunrise \u2013 too terrified to move a muscle.\n\nWorst of all\u2026 I remember as I started thinking of *You*. As *You* began to etch your way into my mind.\n\nInto what would become *our* mind.\n\nOn the next day, I burned the postcard.\n\nI set one edge on fire with my lucky lighter and flung the cursed thing into my fireplace. I watched as the remaining edges charred from the warmth until they were completely wilted by flames. The smell of burning ink soothed my soul; relief washed over me as the blaze grew and engulfed what was left of the cardstock.\n\nNo longer was I thinking of *You*.\n\nBut *You* were still thinking of me.\n\nI didn\u2019t find this out until much later, while at my hometown bookstore. It\u2019s a renovated opera house, three stories, complete with a basement. The top floor serves as residential apartments while the rest of the building, including the basement, serves as the shop. The place is also a labyrinth \u2013 and the bookshelves are the walls. There are dead ends around every corner, but the nooks and crannies lead to secret passageways filled with staircases ascending and descending to who knows where.\n\nLooking back, I can see why it appealed so much to *You*.\n\nOne day, a particular book caught my eye.\n\nIt was thin, appearing to be less than 100 pages, yet its weight felt far more significant. Its spine was ash grey, adorned with crimson colored silk . . . but its cover was as blank as the postcard that I had received weeks ago.\n\nMy entire body tensed.\n\nAgainst my best judgment . . . I opened the book.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why I was surprised to find that it too was also blank. Until I reached the end. There, scribbled in the back cover, was a single line of text, written in the same handwriting from the postcard:\n\n*There\u2019s no place you\u2019re not in view. Nothing that you can do. Remember\u2026 I\u2019m always thinking of you!*\n\nI didn\u2019t make a single sound as I dropped the book out of shock and scurried away \u2013 I can\u2019t recall even hearing the book make a sound either as it hit the ground . . . if it ever hit the ground. My stride didn\u2019t decline until well out the front doors.\n\nSeveral hours later, I mustered the courage to return with the intention of purchasing the book, so I could burn it too \u2013 but it was gone.\n\nAccording to the employees, there was no record it was ever there to begin with. I remember insisting they check again, and again . . . and again.\n\nI remember how funny that was to *You*.\n\nHow your laughter grew louder each time.\n\nHow *You* forced the grin upon my face as I said, \u201cthanks anyways.\u201d\n\nHow *You* laughed the whole car ride home.\n\nAnd how eventually, I was laughing too \u2013 how *we* were laughing!\n\nIt\u2019s been months since that day. *We* do everything together now. *We* can\u2019t wait for others to join us. All the bookstore employees know *our* name when we visit. \u201cStill looking for that blank book?\u201d they cheekily ask *us*.\n\nHow silly.\n\n*We* know where it is.\n\nSoon, *they* will too.",

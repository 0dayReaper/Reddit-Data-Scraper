    "postText": " \n\n**4:34 PM: How to stop husband from cheating?**\n\nI had only clicked on the history tab to delete the last thing I\u2019d searched for when I noticed the entry. Hurriedly, I finished zipping up my fly and stared at it in bewilderment.\n\nAmy and I had been almost too careful. We had never so much as looked at one another in my wife\u2019s presence, let alone done anything that could have raised suspicion. There was no way she could have known what was going on, even if she had looked through my phone. With a heavy heart, I\u2019d forced myself to delete any incriminating photos Amy sent me after I was done with them, and we had a strict call-only policy.\n\nAmy was our latest hire and aside from being great at her job, she excelled in garnering male attention. Everyone loved her. She was strikingly beautiful and uninhibited to the point where her energy felt almost carnal, sending all morals and restraints out the window. I tried to ignore her at first, even finding excuses to go home early, but eventually, her charming giggle got the better of me too.\n\n**4:37 PM: How much does divorce cost?**\n\nDroplets of sweat sprang out on my forehead. *What?* Was my wife planning to divorce me? But *why?* There was no way she knew about Amy and me. Was there someone else? Was she planning to accuse me of infidelity, all while going at it with some lover boy she\u2019d met at her yoga class?\n\n**4:39 PM: Why do humans feel emotions?**\n\nI pursed my lips. If by some miracle my wife did know about the affair, I couldn\u2019t imagine the way she must have been feeling. I woke up late this morning and found a note on the kitchen table, saying that she didn\u2019t want to wake me and that she was out doing her Saturday errands. I almost felt compelled to call her and \u2013 oh\u2026\n\nI flinched as a large drop of blood landed on the keyboard. *What the hell?* My first instinct was to look up at the ceiling. Nothing. A strong metallic smell made me come to my senses. I brushed my hand against my face. A bright red smudge sat on my palm. I stared at it, alarmed. I\u2019d never gotten nosebleeds before, aside from the time I got hit in the face with a football in high school. My head raised, I scrambled to my feet and made a dash for the bathroom, my hands cupping my throbbing nose.\n\nOnce I had managed to stop the bleeding and cleaned myself up, I returned to the computer.\n\n**4:44 PM: Which part of the brain is responsible for love?**\n\nThis was\u2026 an oddly specific search. I couldn\u2019t recall my wife ever being interested in science or biology. I checked the account logged into the browser, just in case. Perhaps this was someone else\u2019s history altogether? Or maybe we\u2019d been hacked?\n\nNo. Seemed like everything was in order. My wife\u2019s smiling face stared back at me from the login window. What was she doing searching for brain parts anyway?\n\n**4:49 PM: What is excerebration?**\n\nWhat? What was\u2026*excerebration?* Some kind of fancy divorce? I\u2019d never heard of the term in my life. I didn\u2019t even hesitate before clicking it, eager to find out what my wife was planning for us.\n\nI wish I hadn\u2019t.\n\nAs the results came up on the monitor, my stomach lurched and my gag reflex kicked in. The images were graphic enough for my hand to automatically gravitate towards the \u2018return\u2019 button, but a short paragraph in bold caught my eye.\n\n***\u2018An ancient procedure involving chiseling through the bone of the nose, in order to scoop out the brain matter.\u2019***\n\nMy heart hammering in my chest, I clicked the \u2018back\u2019 button and scanned the rest of the entries.\n\n**5:01 PM: Can a person live without the hypothalamus?**\n\n**5:05 PM: Location of the hypothalamus**\n\n**5:11 PM: How much Temazepam is safe?**\n\nMy skin crawled as I read, but I couldn\u2019t look away. I was so immersed that I didn\u2019t even hear the front door bang.\n\n\u201cHoney? I\u2019m home!\u201d\n\nI stared at the wall, too shocked to reply. What was I meant to say? How was I supposed to ask her about all this?\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d she called again, her heels clacking towards me.\n\n\u201cUh, hey!\u201d I choked, throwing the box of tissues into the drawer, \u201cHow was\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d she smiled as she appeared in the doorway, \u201cHow are you? You had quite a lot to drink last night!\u201d\n\n\u201cI-uh\u2026\u201d I stammered, \u201cI did?\u201d\n\nShe studied me, as though she wasn\u2019t sure whether I was joking or not.\n\n\u201cThe\u2026 I\u2026 W-what\u2019s all this?\u201d I asked, gesturing to the computer screen.\n\nShe joined me at the desk, frowning at the clammy wood surface, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nI pointed at the browsing history, my index finger shaking visibly in the air.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she flushed, two pink spots appearing on her cheeks, \u201cWell, you did say we could try it, so\u2026 I had to do a little research, y\u2019know?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? I said we could try\u2026what?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she waved her hand dismissively, \u201cThe exce-something. You probably know better.\u201d\n\nMy blood ran cold. *The excerebration.*\n\n\u201cKaren\u2026what did you do?\u201d\n\nBut before she could say anything, a splash of blood landed on the carpet. And then another one. And another. Karen watched me, her skin growing pale, \u201cW-what\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly, a small fleshy lump escaped my nostril and rolled down the front of my shirt. We both stared at it in shocked silence. Then, my wife screamed, turning on her heel to flee the room, but I caught up to her, pinning her against the wall.\n\n\u201cTell me what the fuck you did!\u201d\n\nShe tried to fight me, writhing under my grip, but I held on tight. Blood was streaming into my mouth and down my chin, staining both of our clothes.\n\n\u201cH-how can you not remember?\u201d she screeched, trying to elbow me in the ribs, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember what you did?\u201d\n\nI stared at her panic-stricken face, trying my best to recall any memories from the previous night, \u201cNo\u2026what did I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2026you came home after work and told me you were leaving me for Amy,\u201d she sobbed, \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want to love her, but you did!\u201d\n\nI stood there quietly, mulling it over, as more pulp splashed onto my stomach.\n\n\u201cEw! We need to call you an ambulance!\u201d Karen shrieked, trying to pull away, \u201cWhat the fuck is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what happened?\u201d I demanded, my heart practically leaping out of my chest, \u201cTell me what you did.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck, John?\u201d she screamed, \u201cWe got drunk, okay? We got really wasted! And then you said you knew of a way to fix this! To fix us! You said there\u2019s something called hypothalamus in your brain, and if removed it would stop you from loving Amy\u2026\u201d\n\nI felt like I was having an out-of-body experience. What the hell was she saying? Had she actually attempted to remove a part of my brain? And\u2026\n\n\u201cWait\u2026\u201d I whispered, \u201cWho\u2019s Amy?\u201d\n\nHer expression made me feel foolish for not remembering. I knew that name. *Amy.* It sounded so familiar, and yet I couldn\u2019t for the life of me put my finger on it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026what the fuck do you mean?\u201d she sounded bewildered, \u201cAmy! The girl you were cheating on me with for six months?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t,\u201d I mouthed, releasing my wife and crumpling to the floor, \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d\n\nKaren stared at me, her white blouse resembling a massacre, her mouth pressed into a thin line.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026what\u2019s happening to me?\u201d I whispered.\n\nShe was silent for a moment, but I could see her eyes brimming with tears, \u201cHoney\u2026.What if\u2026 What if I\u2026 accidentally hit your hippocampus instead?\u201d\n\n*What?* That told me nothing.\n\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Karen, I\u2019m not a *fucking* encyclopedia! Enlighten me! What the hell is a hippocampus?\u201d\n\nNothing could have prepared me for what she said next.\n\n\u201cHoney,\u201d she sobbed, \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026a doctor. It\u2019s the memory part of your brain.\u201d",

If so, it's been done already with varying degrees of success. It was actually a fairly common method used by old-school gangsters, mafioso and the like. Since the mob held so much sway in the construction industry, the foundations of major projects like office towers and parking garages were often poured over top of one or more murder victims.\n\nOr, by monument were you meaning like a statue or obelisk, something of that nature? Personally, of the two variations, I prefer this one as it offers more creative potential. I know we're not talking about art here, it *is* after all a jar containing evidence as well as disturbing implications about the bearer. But, who said that disposing of evidence can't be fun?",

    "postText": "I'd always heard the rumors about the store's basement, but I never thought much of it. Just some old wives' tales, I figured. But when my boss explicitly told me not to go down there, I couldn't help but feel a chill run down my spine. What the hell was he hiding?\n\nIt was a slow day at work, and curiosity gnawed at me like a starving rat. I couldn't take it anymore. I had to know. So, I waited until my boss left for lunch, and I made my move.\n\nThe door to the basement was old and creaky, like it hadn't been opened in years. I hesitated for a moment, my heart pounding in my chest. But I had to know. I pushed the door open, and the darkness swallowed me whole.\n\nThe air was damp and musty, like a tomb. I fumbled for the light switch, my hands shaking. When the light flickered on, I saw... nothing. Just an ordinary basement, filled with dusty boxes and cobwebs. I let out a shaky laugh. What the fuck was I so scared of?\n\nBut then I heard it. A soft, barely audible sound. Like someone... or something... was breathing. I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. I strained my ears, trying to pinpoint the source of the sound.\n\nI crept forward, my footsteps echoing in the silence. The breathing grew louder, more ragged. I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing up. I was getting closer.\n\nI rounded a corner, and there it was. A door. A door that shouldn't have been there. It was old and weathered, like it had been there for centuries. The breathing was coming from behind it.\n\nI reached for the doorknob, my hand trembling. I knew I shouldn't open it, but I couldn't stop myself. I had to know.\n\nThe door creaked open, revealing a small, windowless room. The walls were covered in scratches, like someone had been clawing at them for years. And in the corner, huddled in the darkness, was a figure.\n\nIt looked human, but it was... wrong. Its limbs were too long, its eyes too wide. It stared at me, unblinking, and I felt a cold dread settle in my gut.\n\n\"What... what are you?\" I stammered, my voice barely a whisper.\n\nThe thing grinned, revealing a mouth full of jagged, broken teeth. \"I'm what your boss didn't want you to find,\" it rasped, its voice like nails on a chalkboard.\n\nI stumbled back, my heart pounding in my ears. I slammed the door shut and ran, my breath coming in ragged gasps. I didn't stop until I was back in the safety of the store, the basement door locked behind me.\n\nI never went back down there. I never told anyone what I saw. But every night, as I lay in bed, I can still hear that thing's voice, echoing in my head. And I know that one day, it'll come for me.",

I had to know. \n\n\nThis is what we call the \"You Die First\" role in the traditional horror movie imaginatory universe/canon. .\n\n\nThis is also why the late great Sir Terry Pratchett once wrote that were there to be a switch in the bottom of the deepest most remote cave system on the planet, with a big sign over it saying \"END OF THE WORLD SWITCH DO NOT TOUCH\", the paint would not even have time to dry.\n\n\nAlso \u2013 maybe you should have a little think about your boss's motives. When he was so very insistent that you not go down into the basement (because he allegedly did not want you to discover the Not-A-Human)... Why TF would he be so careless as to leave the keys to said basement in your control? And, crucially, why did he **not lock** the door leading to that thing's cell?\n\n\nMaybe your boss just passed the monkey that was on his back onto you.",

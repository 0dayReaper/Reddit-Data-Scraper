The lights in the cabin were back to normal and I couldn\u2019t smell any sulfur. \n\nI cautiously made my way back to my seat and almost cried when the grinning crying flight attendant came by offering a meal. That crappy airline food was the most delicious thing I\u2019d ever eaten. \n\nWhen I\u2019d finished, my mind immediately turned to Mary. What had happened to her?\n\nI crept down the aisle towards first class, trying to keep a low profile. Surprisingly, the flight attendants were nowhere to be seen. They\u2019d almost seemed to ignore me, almost as if they wanted me to find her.\n\nShe had a row to herself and was staring down at her phone in the window seat. I slid into the aisle and shook her arm. \n\n\u201cMary!\u201d I hissed.\n\nShe pulled out her headphones and stared at me with a surprised expression. \u201cYeah? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat did that thing do to you? What did they do to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, remind me how I know you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? We just-\u201d I realized with sinking horror that she had no idea who I was. I fought back tears. \u201cMary, how long have you been on this flight?\u201d\n\nShe checked the watch on her wrist. \u201cWell it\u2019s 4:03 AM so a few hours at least.\u201d She stared at me the same way you\u2019d look at a person claiming they were the second coming of Christ. Her tone was low and reassuring. \u201cHey, don\u2019t worry so much. Look on the bright side; we\u2019ll be landing in about an hour.\u201d\n\nI felt an iron grip on my arm and looked up to see two flight attendants. \u201cSir, this area is for first-class passengers only.\u201d \n\nThey were still crying and grinning, but just with tears this time. I could still see streaks of blood staining the front of their uniforms though. \n\nI was escorted back to my seat where I spent the next several days. Attendants continued to stop by with food, I would use the bathroom, and soon was going absolutely crazy with the monotony. \n\nIn retrospect, those few days weren\u2019t so bad. There\u2019s a lot of content on the internet after all, even with crappy plane WiFi. No, it didn\u2019t get really bad until around ten days later when the WiFi failed.\n\nIt was sometime a week later that I lost control and began screaming for a flight attendant. They didn\u2019t come for several minutes, but eventually one did.\n\n\u201cJust...just let me see the Captain,\u201d I asked.\n\nThe flight attendant bent low and spoke with that same customer-service voice: \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir, the captain has made his decision regarding you quite clear. You didn\u2019t answer his call, and will, therefore, wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite a while I\u2019m afraid. Don\u2019t worry though sir, we\u2019ll be landing in about an hour.\u201d She straightened and walked away.\n\nI started making notches on various parts of the seatback to keep track of different things. One notch for each time I used the bathroom, one for each meal, one for every time I watched a given movie, that sort of thing. \n\nIt was hell. I watched every movie in the seatback a dozen times over. If I ever acted out badly enough, I would be escorted back to my seat by one or more flight attendants. Any attempt at conversation with other passengers was met with confusion by them followed by a quick escort back to my seat.\n\nI\u2019d guess it was on or around day thirty that, in a moment of panic and psychosis, I broke my laptop and phone, screaming at the top of my lungs. No one around me reacted in any way. \n\nTwo months later, I stunk. The muscles in my legs were tight and cramped constantly. I finally concluded that suicide was my only option after my hundred-and-twenty-eight rewatch of Thor Ragnarok. \n\nI got to my feet and limped towards the emergency exit. I knew normally the pressure inside the airplane forced the doors closed, but I figured that nothing about my situation was normal. If this didn\u2019t work, I\u2019d find some other more painful way to go. \n\nI grabbed at the handle and swung it up. To my shock, the door opened easily, though no wind of any kind whipped around the cabin. It remained the standard slightly-too-cold temperature that it\u2019d been for the past who-knew how long. \n\nThe open door called to me, a black portal out of the plane. I stared at it for a long moment, almost too long. An attendant\u2019s hand grabbed my shoulder, pulling me away. In a fit of anger and strength that surprised me, I wrenched away and jumped out of the plane. \n\nThe wind whipping past my face was almost magical, a new sensation after so many months of the same. The ocean below me grew closer and larger, and I realized that suddenly, I didn\u2019t want to die after all. \n\nIt grew larger and larger and larger until it seemed that all I could see was darkness and waves.\n\nI impacted the surface of the water so fast and hard that my entire body jerked around in the seat. I pulled my hand back, sucking at my bruised knuckle. I\u2019d hit it on the seat in front of me.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered. Then shouted. \u201cNO! NO! NO!\u201d\n\nA flight attendant ran down the aisle, kneeling beside me. \u201cAre you OK sir?\u201d\n\nI clenched my hands into fists, almost swinging at her. But then I realized. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t grinning.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t crying. \n\nTo be honest she looked a little scared of me.\n\nI reached my right hand down to my pocket where I could feel my now-unbroken phone. \n\n4:04 AM.\n\n\u201cSir, if you can calm down we\u2019ll be landing in about an hour.\u201d\n\nMy mouth tasted like ash. \u201cThank you,\u201d I managed. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\nI stared unblinking at my phone. It now displayed 4:05 AM.\n\nThen I looked out my window and began to cry at the sight of city lights below me. \n\nWe did land in about an hour. I can\u2019t even begin to explain why or how, but I\u2019m currently sitting in an airport cafe typing this out. I\u2019m free. I\u2019m out.\n\nAnd I\u2019m never going flying again.\n\n---------------------------\n\n---------------------------\n\n\nEDIT: I sure hope the bartender here at the airport just has a naturally wide grin.\n\n---------------------------\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n[Want more?](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorchesterStreet/comments/gbpc8t/a_huge_storm_swept_through_my_town_a_week_ago_it/)",

    "postText": "I always wondered why we were never able to use this staircase in school, but the teachers, staff and the headmaster were able to use them. I never knew where the bottom of the staircase was, because I always saw the teachers walking up the stairs but never walking down the stairs.  In every assembly, the headmaster ordered us not to use the staircase, though we already knew not to. \n\nOne time, the class clown said he was going to go down the staircase that we weren\u2019t supposed to use, and our physics teacher grabbed him and she screamed at him to not go down there. He ended up sitting back down, snickering as some students were whispering to each other and some exchanged confused glances with one another.\n\nThis made me more fixated on knowing more about the staircase. I\u2019d wander around the school, looking to find where the bottom of the staircase was, but I\u2019d never find it. I\u2019d spend my break time asking different people about what they know about the staircase, and if they knew any rumors about them. Every rumor they\u2019d say, I\u2019d write down in my notebook. One rumor someone said was that a student in the 7th grade went down the staircase and was never seen again. Another rumor was that our maths teacher kills anyone who goes down the staircase. Though most of the rumors sounded quite stupid, I still wrote them down.\n\nAt some point, my friend Josh started noticing how curious I was about the staircase. Josh was quite a fearless guy. He would do anything dangerous, as if he was on a suicide mission, like the time when we had a science experiment and he thought that touching the bunsen burner would be a good idea.  He ended up getting severe 3rd degree burns on his hand, which took around a year to heal, and also became the prime example of what not to do in a science experiment. That was only one of the things he did, but I won't go into detail about the others..\n \n2 days ago, as we were sitting on one of the benches after school, Josh asked \n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go down the stairs?\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get suspended, I have a good record unlike you,\u201d I said, rolling my eyes.\n\n\u201cI have a plan though.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt better not be stupid\u2026.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when he pulled a notebook out of his bag, and drew two stick figures.\n\n\u201cThe one with the smiley face is me, and the one with the sad face is you. Do you understand?\u201d He said.\n\n\u201cI do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do this pretty early. About 3 or 4am\u2026 we\u2019re going to break into the school. Don\u2019t worry though, I\u2019ve done it before and succeeded.\u201d He started to draw a gate, then drew the stick figure representing me climbing over, and the stick figure representing him over the gate, as it waited for me to climb down.\n\n\u201cThis plan is kind of stupid,\u201d I said, observing his rushed drawings.\n\n\u201cDo you want to see what\u2019s under those stairs or not?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThen listen. So after we break in, we\u2019ll need to be pretty quiet. No talking until we actually get into the building. We\u2019ll need flashlights, so we\u2019ll both bring our phones. When we get into the building you need to follow me. The stairs are near where our classroom is, remember?\u201d He explained, with a moderately harsh tone. That\u2019s how I knew he was serious.\n\n\u201cOkay, it kind of makes sense\u2026 I\u2019m gonna go now though, tomorrow we\u2019ll go through the plan again. Make sure to write it down, see you tomorrow Josh!\u201d I said, picking up my backpack and leaving.\n\nThe next day, at break, Josh showed me his notebook which contained a detailed plan, explaining exactly what he had said the day before, but in more depth. Though I was hesitant to go through with the plan, I did really want to see those stairs\u2026.I had been so determined to know every single thing about those stairs, and this was like a once in a lifetime chance for me. So I agreed to the plan. That was yesterday.\n\nI had my alarm set for 2:30 am. I got ready which took about 20 minutes. At around 2:55 am, I was out the house. From my house to my school was walking distance, so it was easy for me to get there. When I got there, I was quite surprised to see Josh already there, in front of the gate, looking at the floor.\n\n\u201cOh you\u2019re here already? Should we start now?\u201d He asked.\n\n\u201cYeah sure, why not?\u201d I said.\n\nThat\u2019s when he started climbing up the gate. I made sure to watch his technique so I could do the same when he was done. He climbed up the gate fairly quickly, then climbed down the gate, and he was in.\n\n\u201cYour turn.\u201d\n\nI slowly started climbing the gate, my arms shaking a bit every time I climbed higher. Eventually I was able to get down.\n\n\u201cOkay, now to get inside the building we need to use the back of the building. There\u2019s a door there, and for some reason it\u2019s never locked,\u201d He whispered, and I nodded.\n\nWe started walking at a fast pace, making sure not to step on anything that would make noise.\n\nWhen we finally entered the building, I followed Josh. Using the flashlight on my phone, we slowly made our way up the stairs, being careful of our surroundings. After what felt like forever, we finally found the staircase. \n\n\u201cAre you ready?\u201d He whispered.\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nWe started going down, step by step. It looked normal, and I didn\u2019t get why we couldn\u2019t use it. As we were going down further and further, a foul odor hit my nose, and started getting stronger and stronger as we went down.\n\n\u201cWhat is that smell?\u201d I asked, holding my nose with one hand and holding my phone with the other.\n\n\u201cYou smell it too? It\u2019s horrible,\u201d He said.\nThough the smell was tormenting our nostrils, we kept on going. I started getting quite tired. I felt like I had been waking down those stairs for an eternity. At some point, as I continued to point my flashlight downwards, I saw something. Something abnormal\u2026 out of this world. I held Josh\u2019s arm so he wouldn\u2019t go down any more steps. He was about to open his mouth to speak until he also saw what i was seeing, and immediately closed his mouth.\n\nWe saw darkness. But in that darkness were faces. Some were crying, some were smiling. But as they looked directly into our eyes, their faces became angry. Full of hatred. They started screaming, and shouting unintelligible words. They reached their arms out to us. That\u2019s when the darkness started rising, and I screamed at Josh to run, hyperventilating as tears streamed down my face.\n\nI rapidly ran up the stairs, as the darkness slowly consumed our every step. As Josh was running though, he tripped up a step and fell. I screamed, and heard the sound of synchronized laughter and the sound of Josh screaming in agony and terror, as the creatures pulled him into the void. I kept running up and up the stairs and didn\u2019t dare to look behind me. Somehow I was able to reach the top of the stairs, and when I did I collapsed to the floor, shaking uncontrollably, tears still streaming down my face as I covered my face, screaming.\n\nSomeone tapped my shoulder, and as I uncovered my face I realized it was my physics teacher. She stared at me, with a mix of emotions on her face. She held her hand out, gesturing me to get up. When I got up I realized she wasn\u2019t the only one there\u2026 all the teachers that taught my class were there, in a line all staring at me. Some were crying, some just stared blankly at me with no expression. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to go to the headmasters office, I\u2019m sorry..\u201d She said, her voice slightly quivering.\n\nWhen we arrived, she opened the door and as she shut it, I heard the sound of the door locking. That\u2019s when I realized, this wasn\u2019t the headmasters office\u2026.\n\nThat was a few hours ago, now i\u2019m still here. My phone\u2019s on 46%, and I\u2019m just sitting here, wondering if it was worth it. I should\u2019ve just listened. Now I\u2019ve lost my best friend and I\u2019m going to rot here, and if anyone finds me they\u2019ll only find my decaying body. I\u2019m posting this for everyone to know my story, and to say [goodbye](https://www.reddit.com/u/ruin777/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=1).",

The physics teacher\u2019s voice was quivering and she saved another student before. Some of the other ones were crying, too. \n\nWhat if someone pulled down the stairs like Josh becomes one of the creatures, but someone who witnessed it, like OP, becomes a teacher and is imprisoned there. It would explain her reluctance to send him to the headmaster.",

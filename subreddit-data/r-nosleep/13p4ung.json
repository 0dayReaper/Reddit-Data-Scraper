    "postText": "\nI get chills when I think about it. I changed certain details to make it harder to Google this case (I was able to find it when he initially told me this story), but there\u2019s more truth in this than you want there to be. \n\nI had a fantastic law school professor who was always exceptionally good to me. I was a bit of an odd ball and he took me under his wing. His wife Mary would come to school every Friday and the three of us would have lunch together. We got pretty close, and I noticed he was very protective of her. \n\nMy professor had been a public defense attorney for twenty years before he went into academia. He had a very good attitude about former clients and even visited a few in prison, including a few folks on death row. \n\nHe said you learned pretty quickly that most people are indeed guilty, but you also learned to separate clients from their crimes. Almost all of his homicide cases were gang related and he was a pretty big believer that most gang violence is done under duress. He was also a really big advocate for shorter sentences for minors and better rehabilitation programs. He said even folks who committed really heinous crimes and deserved life in prison would still have their humanity and tended to be easy to work with. \n\n*My point is that although he was very realistic about how most folks are guilty, he wasn\u2019t bitter.*\n\nOnce when I was doing research for him we had some free time. He always spoke so highly of his clients so I finally asked if he ever encountered an actual psychopath or someone who scared him. \n\nThis was his story\u2026 \n\nFor folks who don\u2019t know, public defenders don\u2019t have total control over their caseload. They develop a certain expertise, but a lot of them get assigned the cases they\u2019re assigned. \n\nAnyway, he got assigned a homicide case that was pretty fucking brutal. A woman has been mutilated while still alive, assaulted, and violently murdered. The photos were so bad that my professor got a little sick when he saw them. What\u2019s worse is that it was almost certainly tied to two other cases with women who had also been mutilated, assaulted and killed. They had no physical evidence, but they narrowed down a suspect, a suspect who became my professor\u2019s client. \n\nThe thing is, this client did not seem like the \u201ctype.\u201d My professor had learned pretty early on that violent psychopaths usually have a trail violence in their history before they graduate to murder. He also noted that usually conventionally successful psychopaths did not commit violent crimes because they had worked so hard to acclimate without letting the \u201cmask\u201d slip. \n\n*It should also be noted that before this story, he didn\u2019t actually believe in a \u201cmask.\u201d He found his clients were pretty upfront with him about what crime they committed and why. He said most people who lied to him were pretty stupid.*\n\nThis guy was physically small, and had a wife and kids. He wasn\u2019t wealthy, but he did have a good job and friends. He was exceedingly polite in their meetings and oddly soft-spoken. He also talked about how much he loved his daughters and was a feminist. \n\nThis guy was ADAMANT that he was innocent. My professor kind of shrugged it off. He didn\u2019t spend to much time analyzing if someone was innocent or guilty, but rather what facts could be proven in court. Everything else was a waste of time. \n\nSomething about this guy and the crime he had committed didn\u2019t make a lot of sense to my professor. Not only that, but the state had virtually no solid evidence. As time went on, my professor genuinely started to believe his client might be innocent and started going super hard on this case. He got a witness bared from testifying which really rattled the prosecution. \n\nOne of the things that convinced my professor the most of his client\u2019s innocence was the way his client responded to seeing photos of the victims. They were going to be shown in court and my professor wanted him to be prepared. \n\nThe guy looked like he was going to throw up. He bent over a trash can and looked distraught. \n\nHe also just started rambling like he was experiencing a genuine, authentic trauma response. He just went off about how the girl\u2019s ear was torn off and he kept imagining his wife in that position. He said something a little odd though\u2026 \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but the fact that all the victims are blonde and my wife is brunette is getting to me. What if it could have been her if she had dyed her hair a different color?\u201d \n\nMy professor stared at him with an open mouth, and for a moment he stopped being his attorney and was just a human. \u201cMy wife Mary is a Latina woman and I had the same thought when I saw these photos! Like, maybe it would have been her with just a twist of fate!\u201d \n\nHe sincerely believed right then and there that his client was innocent. He had such a real, raw response. \n\nThings changed when they were very close to the end of the trial. In a very rare move for a violent crime, the prosecutor actually realized she was likely to lose and offered a deal. \n\n*Not a very good one, but attorneys have an obligation to tell their clients of any deal on the table.* \n\nMy professor\u2019s client got very annoyed at this and kept announcing he was innocent.   My professor actually still believed him at this point, but wanted to walk him through the options to be thorough. \n\nSuddenly, the client\u2019s demeanor changed. His hands started shaking as he looked at the table and mumbled about how \u201cthat prosecutor cunt\u201d was just doing this to mess with him.\n\nMy professor was kind of taken aback because his client had been so respectful to everyone at that point, including folks on the opposing side. He understood the stress his client was under and tried to calm him down, assuring him that he had worked with that prosecutor a lot and she generally was fair. She might actually be worried that the sentencing would be too harsh in case they did lose this case. This was objectively a way to lower potential jail time. \n\nHis client looked up at him then with a face that almost knocked my professor over. My professor described his eyes as completely void and lifeless, like his client was looking straight through him. \n\nAccording to my professor, he hasn\u2019t really believed in evil until that day. He believed humans were complicated and could do monstrous things, but he didn\u2019t believe anyone was evil. After this moment, he had a crisis and was shaken to his core. \n\nMy professor stuttered something about how he just wanted to look at the specifics of the deal to make an educated choice and his client cut him off. \n\nThen, all of a sudden, it was like the old version client was back. He was immediately back to the timid, small man who spoke of how much he loved his wife and was a feminist for his daughters. \n\nMy professor was shaken though, and my client noticed. He grew increasingly hostile and started questioning every decision my professor made. My professor even considered asking to get off the case because it\u2019s hard when a client has turned like that, but he worried a judge never would never allow a withdrawal this late in the trial. \n\nWell, my professor\u2019s client got off. Of course he did. Apart from a very questionable witness, they really didn\u2019t have enough evidence to reach beyond reasonable doubt\u2026 Thanks to my professor doing a kickass job. \n\nMy professor tried to shake his client\u2019s hand in the end, and his client just stared coldly at him and then smiled slightly. He mumbled something about how he would never forgive my professor for making a decision he disagreed with. \n\nTwo months later another murder occurred that fit the pattern of the previous attacks. \n\nThe woman who was murdered was a Latina woman also named Mary.",

I remember one of the guys on my block(s) excited to pass his HVAC vocational course. \"CO noslept, I'm absolutely not coming back. I'm doing HVAC and working my way up.\" Even met a guy in my local area that was proud to be working at a fast food joint because \"no one gives felons a chance. I'm going to be the best and one day I'll make it the right way.\" (Sidenote yall, they just moved him to the bigger city about 30 mins away to be a store manager). Really imprinted into me that not all criminals are bad folks. Sometimes, they're young, scared men doing what young scared men do. \n\nThat out of the way - I've met men that you couldn't fathom the darkness that exudes from their character. The kind of darkness that seeps into everything and everyone around them. Child molesters, rapists, gang gunmen, and drug dealers that sold to their moms. Racist, vile, truly hateful men. \n\nIt's weird. There's a \"feel\" with some of them. Everything is an act. Everything is a leading question. Every interaction they're trying to weasel their way into your skull. Even \"good morning\" opens the doors.",

Hence why they got involved with it in the first place. Of course this isn\u2019t strictly true of those recruited in to gangs due to their background but I bet that most of them at least try it and then the most of those that try it, then go on to develop a habit of it.\n\nThe ones that sell larger quantities to communities via the street dealers I would imagine, operate much closer to real organised crime and would be less likely to use it.\n\nThen the bigger staked organised crime gangs above that, even LESS likely than those below them.

So yes from your experience you dealt with addicts selling to use. In my experience I dealt with guys selling to make money. The dope men I did business with were driving brand new luxury SUVs and trucks. They werent using. It all depends on who you were dealing with.

Getting stabbed because you happened to be a peon that overheard big league talk isn't exactly a fun way to live your life. \n\nSounds like a motivated guy who needed a solid direction.

He went in strongly believing in preventative and social measures, along with rehabilitative stuff, but quickly got beaten down. Now while he knows the theory and so forth makes sense, and will even agree with data presented to him will go \"but yeah I dunno\" and basically discuss how people just need to be 'punished', as in having all their freedoms taken away is not enough.\n\nHe's had his good cases, and I know for a fact he's always done the right thing and even fought for what's right even when it put his career at risk, but I know his heart long left it and he's lost all the belief he started out with.\n\nLike I told him when he first ventured into the idea, it is not a job for everyone, it takes an ability to see the worst yet maintain empathy. Not many have the heart for it, you strike me as someone with a lot of heart.",

These are conclusions I came to thinking about it through the newfound clarity that only age and experience can bring. The topic of prison reform has been really popular lately and I took the time to really think about it. I'm certainly glad my life took the trajectory it did. But I didn't always have the outlook I do now. It took a long time to lose the feeling of a real bitter disenchantment with humanity.",

Even the most selfless, sympathetic, truly good person has that voice in their head that gets a little louder when they're wronged. The difference is most of us don't have the ability to hurt others. People like the professors client do have that ability. \nIf you think about it, you never really know someone. Like a best friend. Or a wife. Or even a parent. We only know what that person lets us know. There are stories on the news all the time about a school teacher being arrested for talking to underage girls. Or a man who everyone thought was the nicest man they'd ever met and couldn't hurt a fly was arrested for killing his wife. Some of the most infamous American serial killers were normal people with families and jobs. Point being we never truly know a person",

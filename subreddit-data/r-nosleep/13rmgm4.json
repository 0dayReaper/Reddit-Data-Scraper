    "postText": "Please read [\\[Part 1\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13punq5/its_come_back_for_what_it_left_behind_in_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) before you continue...\n\nAbout a week after my encounter with the creature inside the truck, Grady had to hire extra help to make up for my absence. \n\nI was too afraid to leave our room. Every time I thought I had mustered enough courage to step out, my body should tremble and my breath became labored. I missed the animals so much that every now and then Grady would bring a few in to keep me company, including Wanda.\n\nOne night Wanda waddled her way over to my desk as I was journaling and she shared knowing with me again. She said, \u201cHe\u2019ll always love you, even though you won\u2019t be able to see him.\u201d I looked at her fearfully, hoping she wasn\u2019t speaking of the creature. \n\nA moment later, I heard Grady scream.\n\nI ran out of the house in terror, forgetting all about my fears of leaving our bedroom. One of the teen boys Grady hired, Owen, was on the phone with the paramedics. Two of the other teens kept me from entering the barn, telling me I shouldn\u2019t see Grady in the state he was in.\n\nI heard Owen tell the paramedics that he heard a scream come from the barn and moments later he found Grady in there, face down and unconscious. When he turned Grady over, his mouth was agape and his eyes were milky white.\n\nLife changed drastically after that day. I had to hire a full-time, live-in manager for the Sanctuary - Sally. Sally wasn\u2019t an animal whisperer by any means but she was kind to them and knew how to run a tight ship.\n\nI spent most of my days in Grady\u2019s hospital room\u2026listening to doctors and specialists make their assumptions about Grady's coma.  They were utterly clueless and so was I.\n\nOccasionally, I\u2019d force myself to go have dinner by myself at the local restaurant or coffee at our local cafe. I tried to go during off-peak hours, so I wouldn\u2019t have to partake in mindless chit-chat and just be able to journal in peace. I had a lot of strong feelings that I needed to let out, journaling was all I had to help.\n\nOne day, while I thought I would get the whole cafe to myself to journal, Owen came in to order a coffee to-go. Owen was a kind, shy kid and reminded so much of Grady at his age. I smiled at him and he smiled back, nervously.\n\nI continued to journal until I saw a shadow cross over my page. I looked up to see Owen standing over me with a strange sadness in his eyes. I asked him what was wrong and he said he took something from our barn that day Grady went to the hospital and it was eating him alive.\n\nI was really taken back. Of all our employees, he\u2019d be the last one I thought would ever steal. I told him it was okay and mistakes happen. I wouldn\u2019t fire him because he came to me and admitted it. I asked him to put back whatever it was as though it never happened. \n\nHe replied with, \u201cI think you should have it. I can\u2019t let it go back into the barn.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. Then, he opened his backpack and pulled out a leather bound book. It was Grady\u2019s journal. I looked at the kid and nodded sadly. I asked him why he took it. Owen sat across from me\u2026playing nervously with his coffee lid as he spoke. \n\nHe whispered, \u201cA week before Mr. Grady went into the coma, I was approached by someone outside of my house. A man in a suit\u2026an old time looking suit. He said Mr. Grady would fall ill that week and in the barn was a special book he needed. If I stole that book for him, he would clear the DUI on my record. I don\u2019t know why I believed him, but he looked so serious\u2026I thought he was an important person.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to think but I knew Owen was telling the truth. He looked terrified as he said, \u201cHe told me not to open the book. Not to even glance at it\u2026but Ms. Joslyn\u2026I did.\u201d\n\nA tear rolled down his cheek. Whatever he read in the journal has haunted him ever since. He continued on, his eyes darting around nervously. \u201cI was just curious about what it was. I wish I hadn\u2019t done it, Ms. Joslyn. The man hasn\u2019t been back for the book. I think he knows I saw what was in it. It's in my head now and he doesn't need the book. I hope you guys can forgive me.\u201d\n\nI told him he was forgiven, even though I didn\u2019t really mean it. I guess because he reminded me of young Grady, I got soft. I wanted to ask him questions, so many questions but I didn't know where to start.\n\nBefore I got the chance to ask him anything, he got up and said, \u201cThank you for not firing me but I won\u2019t be going back.\u201d He quickly sat the journal down in front of me and ran through the door.\n\nThat same night, back in the hospital room and with Grady\u2019s journal in my hands, I tried to share knowing with Grady, just as I had every day since the coma. It was no use, I still felt nothing from him. I looked down at the journal, contemplating. We swore to never read each others journals but I wanted to know what Owen had seen that bothered him so much. Why did the man in the suit want it? Most importantly, what if there\u2019s something in the journal that can help wake him up.\n\nI slowly opened the journal. Just as I was about to see the first page, the machines in the room started to blink and make high pitched sounds. I looked around in terror. It knew it was there with me again. I closed the journal and waited for the freeze. It never came. What did come next was the sounds. \n\nUsing the sounds of the different machines, it created words\u2026\u201cHe. Is. Mine.\u201d\n\nThrough tears, I replied with, \u201cTake me instead.\u201d \n\nSilence. The machines stopped and went back to normal. I looked at Grady. I knew he was somewhere terrible and it was because of me.\n\nThat night, I decided to sleep at home for the first time in weeks. If the creature wanted me, maybe if I was back at home and without Grady, he\u2019d decide to take me instead. I just wanted him to leave Grady alone.\n\nI told the doctor on duty, Dr. Green, to watch over Grady until I was back the next morning. He said he\u2019d do anything for us. We took care of two of his prized horses before so he treated us like royalty.\n\nHours later, I visited the animals and gave Sally the night off. If something was going to happen, I didn\u2019t want her to end up like Owen\u2026or even worse. \n\nI turned on the reading light and crawled into bed with Grady\u2019s journal. I opened it and waited. Just as I thought, the reading light began to flicker. I took a deep breath and looked down at the open book. Sounds coming from the kitchen appliances startled me but I pressed on.\n\nAt first, I thought they were drawings. Sometimes I would do it too, draw a picture to go with an entry but as I turned to the next page I found the same\u2026small symbol-looking drawings, instead of letters.\n\nI had never seen those symbols before. As a manically turned each page, sounds erupted from all over the house - from the appliances, TV and radios. I was too focused on what I was seeing to really give into the fear. \n\nThe fear of realizing that Grady\u2026the love of my life was not who I thought he was. \n\nThe fear of realizing that slowly I was able to interpret the symbols as though I was reading plain English. \n\nThe paralyzing fear of reading:\n\n*He said it would be back\u2026but it\u2019s too soon. I can\u2019t let it have her.*",

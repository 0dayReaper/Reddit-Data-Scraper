    "postText": "\u201cI want you to kill her,\u201d the voice echoed. Low, monotonic, unwavering. \n\nIn front of me was my mother, crucified haphazardly upon a ramshackle wooden cross. Rivets were driven through each palm - with rope fastenings in place around her ankles and shoulders to keep her in position. \n\nHer eyes, red and cracked from exposure, pulled open by tape, to reveal pupils dilated with fear. \n\nHer mouth was sewn shut. Muffling her tired pleas.\n\n\u201cThis is hardly an existence,\u201d the voice licked.\n\nI surveyed my surroundings. I was in a small, square room, with metal walls no larger than my studio apartment. The roof, however, was missing, replaced by an empty void that seemed to stretch endlessly into the darkness above.\n\nAbout five feet in front of me was my mother. Writhing weakly against her restraints. Five feet behind her, an impossibly tall ladder stretching into the abyss. \n\n\u201cWhat are you waiting for? As if you care,\u201d the voice prompted.\n\nWho was talking? Where was this voice coming from? Its warm presence swaddled me like a warm blanket.\n\nIn one swift surge, the gravity of the situation dawned on me. I didn\u2019t know where I was. I didn\u2019t like being lost. \n\nI felt the kick of adrenaline into my bloodstream. My heart, beating against my ribcage. My hands, clammy. I clenched them repeatedly. Open, closed. Open, closed. \n\nI needed to get out of here. \n\n\u201cEnd her.\u201d\n\nMy gaze dashed to my right hand side to find a surgical stand stocked full of pain-inflicting paraphernalia. \n\nA knife. A rope. A pistol. Razor blades, full needles, strange pills and powder. \n\nAn arsenal fit to maim, disfigure, destroy.\n\nI reached for the razor blade. I could cut the stitching on my mother\u2019s mouth - garner some insight into what the fuck was going on. \n\nMy mother always knew what was going on. \n\nWith the razor blade in hand, I walked gingerly up to my mother - whose eyes lit up as I approached. \n\nAnd through all the pain, tears and stitches, as I drew closer, she smiled. \n\nI held up my left hand to coddle my mother\u2019s face, with the razor blade still pinched in my right. \n\nAnd as she nuzzled her face into my palm, I cracked. I wept harder than I\u2019d ever wept before. Full-bodied, wracking sobs crashed over me. \n\nBecause it didn\u2019t matter how bad anything got. It didn\u2019t matter how broken the situation, or how broken the person. \n\nMy mother was just happy I was there. \n\nI steadied myself and lifted up my right hand, trembling as I drew closer to her face - ready to pick away at the stitches to the best of my ability. \n\nThe first few snapped, then the next, until all the stitches had been split and I had liberated her mouth from its cage. \n\nI exhaled raggedly, leaning back to look deeply into my mother\u2019s eyes. \n\n\u201cM-Mum?\u201d\n\nBut as tears fell down her cheeks, through her warm, loving smile, she uttered one word. \n\n\u201cClimb.\u201d\n\nI peered past her towards the ladder, then looked back towards her for reassurance. It took a slow, simple nod to realise that this was what I had to do. \n\nAnd as I walked slowly towards the ladder, she murmured one last thing. \n\n\u201cI love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you too, mum.\u201d\n\nI never said that enough.\n\nThen, with razor blade still in hand, I climbed. I climbed with determination. I climbed for what seemed like hours. \n\nI climbed past broken rungs, and even when I was tired, I kept on climbing. \n\nI cried as I climbed, but I pushed through, with snot dribbling down my chin and tears clouding my vision. \n\nI reminisced as I climbed. I climbed through good memories, I climbed through bad memories. I climbed through the time when I had the flu and my mother came around to do my laundry, and I climbed through the time my girlfriend cheated on me. \n\nI climbed because I was sick of this dark room. I climbed to make my mother proud. \n\nAnd as I climbed, the darkness subsided, opening itself up to light. \n\nI could see the where the ladder ended now. I could see my way out. \n\nAs I placed my hand on the last rung of the ladder and pulled myself up over the edge, I was overcome by brightness. \n\nThe light subsided, and as I got my bearings, I found myself on my back in my bathtub, still clutching the razorblade. \n\nUrgent knocking on my bathroom door roused me from my daze.\n\n\u201cAre you alright in there? Your sister called. We\u2019re worried about you.\u201d\n\nIt was my mother\u2019s voice.\n\nI got up out of the bathtub, and placed the razorblade back on the shelf, walking towards the door. And as I flung it open, she looked at me. She looked at me and she knew. \n\nShe held me in her arms and we sobbed. \n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know how to live without you,\u201d she whimpered.\n\nMy climb had just begun.",

In approximately two minutes of just vague scrolling I came across this particular title and something inside me told me to read it.  I read the your story, OP, and the associated commentary, (which is apparently from other readers who are much like me).

Hid mother, tortured and crucified is metaphorically him and how he\u2019s feeling. This occurs again later.\n\nThe voice is the bad one in his head telling him to kill himself, it has his mother tortured and crucified- perhaps illustrating his inner personal feelings now inflicted upon the woman he cares most for. \n\nHer mouth is sewn shut and he is told to kill her- this is again the negative thoughts reflecting what he wants to do to himself. He instead opts to reach into his pocket and use a knife to free her mouth. She tells him to \u201cclimb\u201d up the ladder, illustrating his climb from catatonia to full lucidity, where his mother is at his bathroom door. On his climb he remembers his good and bad memories, but particularly fond memories of his mother. She has presumably been calling him for a while and initiated this delusion.\n\n\nHe opens the door and his mother realizes he\u2019s tried to kill himself and tells him she can\u2019t imagine life without him, making him switch from suicidal to driving to become mental well, on a new climb. \n\nSo it\u2019s pretty deep.

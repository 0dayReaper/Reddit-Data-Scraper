As much as I had hoped to avoid it, I\u2019ve found myself directly in the middle of the craziness.. There have been several new developments since leaving the apartment. It\u2019s taken a few days, but I finally found a few minutes to write about it.\n\nAfter Sydney and Larry bashed the apartment door in and presumably saved me from Ollie, Larry told me to follow Syd. I got in her car and we left while Larry stayed behind to \u201ctalk\u201d to Ollie.\n\nDespite Ollie threatening me and the possibility that he was really a serial killer, I was uncomfortable thinking about what Larry might be doing to him. His suggestion that Larry might not be a \u201cgood guy\u201d stuck with me. It was true that I was on Larry\u2019s side because I met Larry first. Maybe I was doing the wrong thing, but I wasn\u2019t about to complain about being saved. I wanted to find a nonchalant way to ask Sydney more about Larry.\n\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked from the passenger seat of her not so inconspicuous orange jeep.\n\n\u201cSomewhere safe,\u201d she calmly replied.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t give me the vague responses and the cloak and dagger act.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you need to know, Frank?\u201d she asked, sounding irritated. \u201cLarry sent you a letter detailing everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean.. How did you end up involved?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI ran into Mike.. Larry when he was leaving the apartment the first time. He stopped at the gas station down the road. I approached him because the rent had been paid up for the next 6 months and I wasn\u2019t sure why. I wasn\u2019t mad about it, but I was confused.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, what?!\u201d I said. \u201cWhy have I been paying rent the last 2 months then?\u201d\n\n\u201cRelax,\u201d she said while almost cracking a smile. \u201cYour rent money will be returned to you. You\u2019re gonna need it.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor what?\u201d I asked nervously.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to get off the grid. There are more people like Ollie who are gonna be after you, after both of us. There are the rebellious octopuses who see you as the key to getting to Larry. You need to keep your head low.. You\u2019re also going to need a disguise.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, really? A disguise?\u201d I laughed.\n\n\u201cYou have to take this seriously,\u201d she said with a glare. \u201cYou\u2019re in danger. We all are.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, how do you factor in?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou said you ran into Larry. What made you help him? Or.. Are you an octopus?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m human,\u201d she replied. \u201cLarry remembered me from the few times I came to the apartment in the past. When I asked about the rent, he asked if I would have a cup of coffee with him. I agreed. He quickly revealed himself to be Larry. It was tough to believe at first.. We got to talking about society, pollution, animal cruelty, politics, ect, and I realized that I agreed with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you ever worry that he\u2019s just charismatic and manipulates us?\u201d I asked nervously. \u201cHe\u2019s helped me out and everything.. but we\u2019re talking about helping another species overtake humans as the planet\u2019s dominant species..\u201d\n\nShe paused for a moment and lit a cigarette. She offered me one and I took it even though I don\u2019t smoke.\n\n\u201cThe way I see it, there are three potential outcomes,\u201d she said in a very serious tone. \u201cThe people who are in charge now stay in charge. They continue to pollute the oceans, rip open the ozone layer, tear down the rainforest, destroy natural ecosystems, and your grandchildren end up living underground if they\u2019re lucky..\u201d\n\nI tossed my cigarette out the window as she continued.\n\n\u201cIf Jeff prevails, we slowly but surely end up living under a global dictatorship run by a psychopathic cephalopod. Or, we could help Larry. He only wants to prevent those outcomes. He doesn\u2019t want to harm anyone that doesn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can you feel so certain about Larry?\u201d I asked.\n\nShe looked at me and said, \u201cLarry didn\u2019t need to save you today. The only reason you are valuable to Jeff and Ollie\u2019s group is that they know Larry will do whatever it takes to protect you. You are leverage to them because you are important to him..\u201d\n\nI sat quietly and thought about what she said. She had a point. They didn\u2019t need to save me, unless there was something they needed me for. I can\u2019t imagine what that would be though.\n\nThe rest of the ride was silent. I was trying to wrap my head around everything as Sydney pulled into the parking lot of a small motel.\n\n\u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWaiting for Larry and showing you your new home.. temporarily.\u201d\n\nI followed her into one of the rooms of the seedy little motel. It wasn\u2019t.. disgusting, but it wasn\u2019t the ritz either.\n\n\u201cYou can stay here or at the compound,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to stay under the radar as much as possible. While we wait for Larry, I\u2019m gonna grab some hair dye and some supplies. What do you like to eat? I\u2019m guessing beer and Funyuns?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat am I, a college freshman?\u201d I laughed.\n\n\u201cWhat would you like me to get?\u201d She asked.\n\n\u201cI dunno.. I guess just some stuff for ham sandwiches or something like that? Do I really have to dye my hair?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re gonna stay with us, you do. If not, I would still strongly recommend it. There are a lot of dangerous people after you, and their numbers are growing by the day.\u201d\n\nShe put her coat in and grabbed her keys.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right back. Don\u2019t go anywhere. I\u2019ll just be right next door,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, ham, cheese, bread, and you\u2019ll be good with that?\u201d\n\nI nodded as she walked toward the door.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d She asked.\n\n\u201cCould you also grab some beer and Funyuns?\u201d\n\nShe snickered as she walked out the door. I turned on the tv to try and take my mind off the situation for a minute. I felt a rush of relief as I laid back on the bed. I was exhausted. The blankets were somewhat dirty but I didn\u2019t care. I just wanted to lay down and relax for a change.\n\nI hadn\u2019t realized how long it had been since I had a good night's sleep. I dozed off and fell into a wonderful slumber for a few beautiful minutes.. ONLY TO BE AWAKENED BY SOMEONE BANGING ON THE DOOR!\n\nIt startled the shit out of me. I got up and instinctively went to open the door before realizing.. Sydney has the room key..\n\nI slowly backed away from the door, desperately hoping that it was Larry and not one of the several people and non-people who wanted to do presumably terrible things to me.\n\nI tiptoed backward through the room trying to find a good hiding spot. It was a very small room and there weren\u2019t many options. There was a small closet area but no door. Very little room under the beds, not to mention that it would be the first place someone would check. Same with the shower. No back windows..\n\nThe knocking continued and started to get louder and more frequent. It sounded angry, like when a police officer knocks on the door. Having no other choice, I climbed underneath the bed. I had a small pocket knife with me as my only protection. I pulled it out and held my breath as I waited for whoever was at the door to hopefully leave.\n\nEvery time the knocking started again, it made me jump. It was loud and it had been going on for way too long. This wasn\u2019t a maid. This wasn\u2019t someone casually visiting. This was someone determined to get into the room..\n\nAs I waited in my very obvious hiding place, I heard a scraping noise coming from the door. They had given up knocking, and were now attempting to pick the lock. The small amount of hope I had that this wasn\u2019t someone nefarious had faded away as I listened to them stab at the tumblers of the lock.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take them long to break through after that. I could see their feet moving from under the bed. They both walked toward the bathroom and began searching in there. One of them walked out and stopped right in front of the bed I was underneath.\n\nI held my breath as I sat there helplessly. I knew they would find me. He stopped walking and bent down. As he saw me he began to yell to his friend. He couldn\u2019t get the words out before Sydney was on top of him choking him out. I hadn\u2019t even seen her come in as the man hadn\u2019t closed the door all the way.\n\nI started crawling out from underneath the bed. The other guy came out from the bathroom and started waving a baseball bat. Sydney seemed to have the first one overpowered and was continuing to choke him unconscious. I tried to scurry away backwards on my butt as the other guy swung as a bat wildly.\n\nI made it almost to the doorway when I saw something small hit the man in the neck. He reached for his neck and pulled out a small dart with a feather. Seconds later, he fell to the floor.\n\nI was confused at what had happened until Larry came running in. He pulled the one guy off of Sydney. She had choked him out, but was struggling to get out from under his weight.\n\n\u201cIs that a freaking blow dart gun?!\u201d I yelled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very handy tool,\u201d Larry replied. \u201cNow pack your shit. We have to move.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are these guys?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThese look like Ollie\u2019s friends..\u201d Larry said. \u201cEither way, someone knows where we are, so we gotta  get moving quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are they after us? What the hell do they want with me?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll, you\u2019re with us,\u201d Larry replied. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, buddy. You aren\u2019t safe.. it\u2019s my fault, and I truly am sorry. I will do everything I can to protect you. You just have to listen to me and do what I tell you to do. And relax, they weren\u2019t after you. They were after Syd..\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy Syd? I asked.\n\nLarry and Sydney looked at one another. It was clear that there was something they weren\u2019t telling me. Larry started to answer, but then stopped speaking and gestured to Sydney to explain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve been really confused lately as to who are human and who are octopuses. You\u2019ve obviously seen a lot of bizarre stuff in a short period of time. It\u2019s just gonna take some adjusting. I am completely and totally human. What is inside of me isn\u2019t though..\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cThere are octopuses gestating inside of me. I volunteered for this. The fact of the matter is that Larry is an exceptional octopus. Most of them have the abilities you\u2019ve been seeing, but none of them can\u2019t seem to access them as effectively as Larry. There is something he possesses that they don\u2019t. We believe the same will be true for his offspring. I\u2019m carrying those offspring.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be an uncle, Frank!\u201d Larry said with a big, proud smile.\n\n\u201cWhoa.. so are you two like.. together?\u201d I asked, confused.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sydney laughed. \u201cWe did it artificially. I am essentially a voluntary host. I will carry the offspring until they are ready to live on their own at which point they will be surgically removed.\n\n\u201dI was dumbfounded. It felt like an afterschool special. Like they were telling me about the birds and the bees, just with a really strange twist.. They explained to me that both Ollie and his group as well as Jeff and his are after the offspring.\n\n\u201cWe have a mollusk among us,\u201d Larry said.\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the term he uses for mole,\u201d Syd explained.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s hilarious,\u201d I said as I rolled my eyes.\n\n\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Larry replied in a very serious and somber tone. \u201cEnough talking. Let\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u201d\n\nWe quickly packed up our stuff, as well as some towels and soaps from the motel. We all went out and got into Sydney\u2018s jeep.\n\n\u201cAre you riding with us?\u201d She asked.\n\n\u201cWe have to stick together from here on out,\u201d Larry replied. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the warehouse. It\u2019s the safest possible place.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe warehouse?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cGet ready to have your mind blown, buddy,\u201d Larry said with a laugh.\n\n\u201cI Think my mind has been blown enough,\u201d I replied. \u201cI\u2019m probably developing a callus..\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve only seen the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Larry said. \u201cWe just gotta lose these guys, then we\u2019ll show you the place we\u2019ve been working out of,\u201d He said calmly.\n\n\u201cWhat guys?\u201d Sydney asked.\n\n\u201cBlue truck and the white car,\u201d Larry responded. \u201cJust watch the road. We\u2019ve got these guys.\u201d\n\nLarry pulled two large handguns out of the duffle bag. He loaded both and handed me one.\n\n\u201cThe safety is off, Frank,\u201d he said with a smirk. \u201cReady to get your hands dirty?..\u201d",

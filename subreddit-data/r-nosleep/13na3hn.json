    "postText": "To whoever's reading this, I need advice. My name is Amethyst, and I need to get away from this town as fast as possible. But I think it's too late\u2026\n\nFor a little backstory, I moved to Kingstown a few months ago with my parents. My parents wanted a fresh start, and my mum had gotten a really good job offer there. Apartments there were cheap, so my parents decided that this was the perfect place for them to settle. Things at school weren't really going that well for me, so I didn't mind moving to another town. I wish I had just stayed\u2026\n\nFor the first month there, everything was going smoothly. We had settled into the apartment pretty quickly, it was quite a small apartment but a comfortable one. Both my parents had started working, so money wasn't really a problem for us anymore. I had taken an entrance test for a school, and I was yet to receive the results. I didn't think I did that well on the test, so when I got the acceptance letter I was pretty nervous  but excited. My parents were happy I got in and I was to start in a month.\n\nNot long after, it was my first day of school. As I entered the school gates, I felt like something wasn't right\u2026 but I didn't know what. I was supposed to go to the administration office so the principal could give me a timetable. I didn't know my way, so I asked one of the students that was going a similar way as me.\n\n\"Hi, do you know where the administration room is? My name is Amethyst, by the way,\" I said.\n\nShe smiled at me and said, \"It's just straight ahead of you. My name's Rose, it's nice having a new student here. Maybe we can be friends. I don't know if they would like that though.\"\n\nBefore I could answer, she walked off, leaving me with many unanswered questions. Who are *they?* Why wouldn't *they* like me and her being friends? I decided to just forget about what she said and headed to the principal's office.\n\n\u2013\n\n\nThe principal was really weird.. I still remember how weird I felt as he spoke. He just handed me my timetable, and told me to obey the rules, expecting me to know what he was talking \nabout. His words were stern, and clear. It felt like my presence disturbed him or something.  Other than that, my first day was somewhat okay. That day, I found out Rose was in one of my classes so I ended up befriending her. I never asked her who *they* were, though.\n\nThe first two weeks of school were somewhat okay. They were normal. By the third week, I started noticing how abnormal the school was.\n\nFirst, the students. Everytime a class started, everyone would say the rules of the school. Though, it was more like they would chant them. It sounded robotic. I always decided to follow them, because I didn't want to get in trouble, and I guessed these were the rules the principal had told me to obey. These were what they would say:\n\n*We cannot speak when the teacher is talking.*\n\n*We cannot be distracted by anything when the teacher is teaching.*\n\n*We cannot be disrespectful to a teacher.*\n\n*We cannot ask for help from a teacher.*\n\n*They will not like it if we do not obey the rules.*\n\n*We know they will not like it if we do not obey the rules.*\n\nSecondly, no one really\u2026 spoke to each other. I would always get weird looks when I would speak to Rose in the hallways. I always wondered why I got those looks. Why did they care so much if I wanted to speak to my friend? Rose told me to ignore them, because they're just jealous. I decided to listen to her.\n\n\u2013\n\n\nBy the fourth week of school,  I wanted answers. At lunch, I asked Rose, \"What happens if you don't follow the weird rules we have to chant?\" She looked at me, her face pale, and said, \"You don't wanna know. My friend disobeyed the rules once. I say once, because I never saw her again. I don't know what they did with her. I miss her everyday.\"\n\nI noticed tears welling up in her eyes, and I hugged her. \"I'm sorry Rose\u2026I know I shouldn't ask this, but who are they?\" I asked. \n\nShe sighed and said, \"The teachers\u2026they're not human. I don't know what they are, but I know for a fact they're not human. I know they were the ones who took my friend and probably killed her. They probably made her one of them. Most people in this town aren't human...\"\n\nI heard the emotion in her voice. The anger, but also the helplessness. The fact that she couldn't do anything about her friend. I knew most people in this town weren't human. I could tell, their movements always seemed...fake. Not long after that, she broke down crying. I comforted her, as the students started turning to look at us with that same weird look.\n\nThat was the last time I ever spoke to Rose.\n\n\u2013\n\n\nAfter school, since it was a Friday, I decided to research about my school. No results. I told my parents about the school and what happened to Rose's friend, and they just\u2026 stared at me and they both just *laughed.* They had no remorse whatsoever. They found it funny. I shouted at them, tears of frustration running down my cheeks. They laughed, even louder. As if it were to mock me. \n\nOn Monday, Rose wasn't at school. I remembered that I didn't see her at the end of the school day on Friday\u2026 I had only seen her at lunch. I asked one of the so-called teachers where she had been, and they said that she had broken one of the rules so she will not be attending school anymore. My heart dropped. *Not attending school anymore?* *Broke one of the rules?* I just started running, to where\u2026 I don't know..I just remember myself running, running through the hallways, my vision blurring with tears. \n\nI stopped in front of the gates, which were locked, and just broke down crying. What did I do to deserve this? What should I do next? Rose was my only friend, the only normal person in this school. in this town. Now I don't even know what happened to my own parents. Then I did something I shouldn't have done. I skipped the class. I had somehow managed to climb over the gates, though I did injure my knee pretty badly climbing over. Then I just started.. walking. \n\nThen someone tapped my shoulder.\n\nWhen I turned to see who it was, it was Rose. Well\u2026 it looked like her. But\u2026 something was extremely off. her eyes were black, her head was tilted to an unnatural angle, and she was\u2026smiling. Her smile looked somewhat painful... Black tears were falling out of her eyes.\n\nThe thing imitating Rose said, \" You just broke a rule. 5 days left for you\u2026 since you're new\u2026\" Then it disappeared. \nMy heart was beating so fast I thought it would leap out of my chest. What was that..thing? When I turned back, something unusual had happened\u2026 everything was black and white, and blurry\u2026 then I saw fire, engulfing my surroundings. There was a circle of fire around me, and I just watched in shock and despair. Smoke flooded my nostrils and I started coughing, the smoke slowly suffocating me. I thought I was going to die. Then after a minute of what seemed like hell on earth, it just.. went to normal.\n\nI ran back home, locked the door shut, and broke down crying once again. I opened my parents room to tell them what I had witnessed, but those things weren't my parents. I *know* they weren't. They had the same black eyes, and they were smiling at me, their heads tilted in that same angle. I slammed the door shut and locked myself in my room.\n\nThat was 4 days ago. It's Friday now, and I've not been to school since. I've been in and out of my room, but my \"parents\" haven't come out of their room since. Tomorrow is my time. If this gets through, please\u2026help me.",

You don't seem to have much time, so forgo supplies and get the hell out of there, grab a knife or something, but don't go out of your way to fight, that's a last resort. Burn the house on your way out, and steal a car. Don't worry if you don't know how to drive, you don't have to feel bad about any 'collateral damage', because well, they're not human... Anymore at least. Put some MAJOR distance between you and that shithole town, try to at least cross state lines, and don't bother with police or National Guard. Police will think you're crazy and arrest you for the car theft and arson, government will just shoot ya right there. \n\nI'm gonna be honest with ya here, your life is gonna get a LOT harder from here on out. The world ain't what we think it is, and once you see behind the curtain, the shit from behind it has a tendency to show up around every corner. \n\nRemember Rose. Survive for her, it's what she would want. Good luck.",

    "postText": "When I was little\u2026 maybe six or seven years old\u2026 my parents divorced and the family as a whole sort of just\u2026 dissolved. I went with my mother, my older brother went to live with my father and my older sister just\u2026 left. One day she was there in her room and the next\u2026 she was gone. Mom looked for her and called everyone that she knew who might have any idea where my sister went\u2026 but no one could tell her anything.\r  \n\r  \nThankfully eventually my sister came back\u2026 but only to let mom know that she was ok and to leave her alone. She was the first to leave.\r  \n\r  \nYears passed and mom and I moved around all the time. It wasn\u2019t that mom couldn\u2019t get or keep a job, she\u2019d just get these\u2026 feelings\u2026 and we\u2019d move. Sometimes we had plenty of time to pack up everything and move at a safe pace\u2026 while other times, she\u2019d load as much as she could into our car, throw me into the passenger seat and then be away before dawn.\r  \n\r  \nThis happened so many times, but as I grew up, I assumed it was normal to not live somewhere more than a year at a time\u2026 or in some cases even less. We moved to so many states, moving randomly at the drop of a hat.\r  \n\r  \nThis made it hard for me to make friends. When you\u2019re always the new kid, no one wants to talk to you\u2026 let alone make friends with you. That\u2019s when I met Laura.\r  \n\r  \nLaura was\u2026 I guess you could call her perfect. She had perfect skin, perfect teeth, perfect soft platinum blond hair and perfect deep blue eyes. She smelled like flowers. Her voice was soft and she giggled a lot. Most importantly\u2026 she said she loved me.\r  \n\r  \nOnly thing that was wrong with her was\u2026 no one else could see her.\r  \n\r  \nI learned that early on when I tried to tell mom about Laura and she didn\u2019t believe me. I tried to point her out to mom and when there was no one there that she could see, she thought I was lying to her and spanked me.\r  \n\r  \nMom believed that you don\u2019t lie to your parents and that everything your parent says is law. Break that law and you are punished\u2026 with each punishment growing larger and more painful the more you do. I would experience that to it\u2019s highest level as I grew older.\r  \n\r  \nYou get beaten enough and you stop saying anything\u2026 to anyone\u2026 and after trying to show Laura to mom enough times that she transitioned to beating me upside the head. Well\u2026 I stopped talking to mom altogether.\r  \n\r  \nShe told me that Laura wasn\u2019t real. I knew she was wrong. I could see Laura. I could hear Laura. I should smell Laura and I could feel her. I knew mom was wrong\u2026 so Laura became my secret.\r  \n\r  \nFor years I would never understand how I was the only one who could see her, but even I knew there was something special about her. I learned that the first time we moved after I had found her.\r  \n\r  \nMom moved us close to 1000 miles away one April and I was destroyed. I could see Laura watching us drive off. I was crying softly to myself. I was losing my only friend and as I watched her get smaller and smaller\u2026 I just saw her smiling, as if she knew something I didn\u2019t.\r  \n\r  \nI was heartbroken and so mad at my mom. I didn\u2019t speak the entire trip, which made mom mad enough to split my lip when she slapped me across the face. I didn\u2019t care. By then, I pretty much hated my mom and was going to do as my brother and sister and leave when I was old enough.\r  \n\r  \nThree days we were on the road and then we were in our new town and pulling into the driveway of our new house. There was a moving van there and a couple of guys who were moving our stuff for us. Mom let us keep our things this time\u2026 a rare occasion\u2026 so all we had to do was drive.\r  \n\r  \nI stayed out of the way and just sat on the grass until they were done. Mom was busy inside with them, telling them where to put everything. She also didn\u2019t want me bothering them because one of them asked what happened to my lip\u2026 and mom didn\u2019t have a good excuse ready.\r  \n\r  \nI sat there and played with a blade of grass until I felt small hands cover my eyes and heard a soft voice speak to me.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cGuess who\u2026\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI blinked, my eyelashes touching her soft skin as I turned my head and saw Laura standing behind me.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHey there\u2026 did you miss me?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI just stared at her in shock and then began to cry as I hugged her. I wasn\u2019t even ten yet, so I didn\u2019t know any better\u2026 but there she was, my Laura. She just hugged me so tightly and played with my hair as I cried.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHow?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nLaura smiled and let out her soft giggle.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou belong to me. I can always find you.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThinking back on it now, that should have been my first sign that something was\u2026 off\u2026 but I didn\u2019t care or know any better then. I had my Laura back and she was real.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cPeter\u2026 what happened to your lip?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI pursed my lips and tried to hide it, but she grabbed my chin and held me in place.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDid your mommy do that\u2026 to you?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI nodded slowly and Laura leaned in close to me. I didn\u2019t know what she was going to do, but she kissed my lip and smiled.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThere\u2026 all better now.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI stared at her in shock. She\u2019d kissed me\u2026 and it was then I noticed my lip didn\u2019t hurt anymore. I reached up and rubbed my lip and there was no cut. Somehow\u2026 she\u2019d made it go away.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHow\u2019d you do that?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nLaura laughed and sat down next to me.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cLike I said\u2026 you belong to me\u2026 and I didn\u2019t want you hurt.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nShe wrapped her arms tighter around me and rested her head on my shoulder.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSo\u2026 tell me all about our new home.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nOur new home. Finally it felt like home. All I needed was Laura to make it better.\r  \n\r  \nThat was the first time that she did something that I couldn\u2019t explain\u2026 but it wouldn\u2019t be the last.\r  \n\r  \nA couple of years passed and we moved a few more times. I didn\u2019t care anymore because I knew Laura would be with me no matter what. I didn\u2019t bother trying to make friends, but I learned how to lie to mom and make up just enough friends to make her stop caring what I did.\r  \n\r  \nSoon came my thirteenth birthday and for some reason, Laura was very excited. She kept telling me she had a surprise for me. She said that she was almost ready to make things\u2026 perfect.\r  \n\r  \nMake things perfect. That was something she\u2019d say really often. Mom would get mad and yell at me and Laura would tell me not to worry.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m going to make things perfect and then you and I will never be separated ever again. Your mom won\u2019t ever hurt you\u2026 once things are perfect.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI never knew what she meant by that until it was a week before my birthday. Mom was in a really good mood, which was strange for her, and she\u2019d gotten herself a boyfriend. I didn\u2019t like him, but Laura told me to let it go and ignore him.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHe\u2019s important Peter\u2026 trust me.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nTrust me. Laura had been saying that a lot the last year. She had so many plans for us and wanted me to just trust her to know what to do. I loved her so I just nodded and let her handle things, so I listened to her on this as well.\r  \n\r  \nA few days before my birthday, mom came home drunk and laughing with Mike, her boyfriend. She collapsed onto the couch giggling and yelled for me to come to the living room.\r  \n\r  \nI hated it when she was drunk but knew better than to ignore her. I left my bedroom, with Laura following me, and headed over to the couch.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHey\u2026 there\u2019s the shitstain that popped out of my crotch. Did I ever introduce you to my spawn, Mike?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nMike winced and nodded.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYes Becca, I know Peter.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nMom laughed and rolled her eyes.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHis name\u2019s not Peter; he\u2019s shitstain\u2026 or cumwad\u2026 that would be better. Should have pushed him down the drain the night his father pumped me full of his sewage. Would have been better off.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nMy eyes dropped to the ground as I turned red from a mix of anger and embarrassment.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHey\u2026 fuckwad\u2026 you look at me when I\u2019m talking to you.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI looked back up at my mom and her eyes were so dark. Her pupils were so wide there was almost no color at all there.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be going on a trip. Mike\u2026 out of the kindness of his heart\u2026 has offered to take me to Vegas for a vacation and agreed to pay to send you to stay with your dad while we\u2019re gone.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI nodded.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThank you Mike.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nMike nodded.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome kiddo\u2026 and I\u2019m sorry about your mom.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nMom snapped. She glared at Mike and her expression went dark.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize for me. That piece of cum droppings is mine. I can do whatever the fuck I want to him and no one can tell me otherwise. Now\u2026 do you want to walk your ass out of my home or do you want to apologize to me and take me to my room where you can make me feel better.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nMike winced and nodded. Standing up, he scooped up mom and carried her toward the bedroom. He paused at her door and turned to look at me. He blinked at me and his eyes seemed to look to my right for a moment before looking back at me.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cPack your clothes and stuff, Peter, and I\u2019ll take you to the airport in the morning.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI nodded as they went into Mom\u2019s room and shut the door. I looked at Laura and saw her smiling at the closed door.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go pack your things. Mike will make sure your mom sleeps late tomorrow so she won\u2019t bother you when we leave.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI looked at Laura and saw her smiling at the door and it was then I remembered something. Mike looked at me\u2026 then looked to my right\u2026 then back at me. Laura was standing to my right.\r  \n\r  \nMike could see Laura?! How? How was that possible? No one else could see her\u2026 just me. No one in close to three years could see her. Why now?\r  \n\r  \n\u201cCome on\u2026 we need to pack.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI let Laura drag me to my room and watched as she packed my suitcases. My clothes were going into one as well as some of the books I was reading\u2026 but she didn\u2019t stop there. She started packing all of my stuff into suitcases\u2026 suitcases I didn\u2019t even know I owned.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cLaura\u2026 why are you packing so much? I won\u2019t need this much stuff for just a week.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nLaura just turned her head and smiled at me.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cTrust me\u2026\u201d\r  \n\r  \nTrust me\u2026 those words again. I just nodded and helped her pack. We packed for what felt like an hour before she set my alarm and told me to go to sleep. Usually she\u2019d just sort of walk off somewhere and come back in the morning, but this time\u2026 she crawled in bed with me and curled into my side.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou\u2019re going to sleep here?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nLaura looked up at me from where she was laying in my bed and smiled.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cFrom now on\u2026 I\u2019m going to be sleeping with you. I won\u2019t have to go away anymore\u2026 not after we leave.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAccepting that Laura knew best, I just nodded and drifted off to sleep\u2026 only to wake up, hours later, to her shaking me awake.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cPeter\u2026 wake up\u2026 we have to go now.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI opened my eyes to see Laura smiling down at me. In her hands was a small purse that looked like the one my sister used to have when I was five.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhere\u2019d you get that?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nLaura smiled and showed me the purse.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI grabbed it from your mom\u2019s office\u2026 along with a few other important things.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nOpening the purse she showed me that it was filled with paperwork, some pictures and money\u2026 a lot of money.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat is that and where did you get it?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nLaura smirked.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI told you\u2026 from your mom\u2019s office. I grabbed your birth records and all the money your mom had in her safe. I know things are going to go the way I want them to\u2026 but it never hurts to be safe.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI was confused but I just shrugged and got up. I started dragging my suitcases into the living room and found Mike waiting for me. He had a cut on his cheek and looked very tired.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHey kiddo. Your mom\u2019s still asleep so I\u2019ll take you to the airport now and then come back for her later. Do you have your stuff ready?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI nodded and he smiled, then seemed to nod to something behind me before he grabbed my stuff and headed out to his car. I turned my head to see Laura standing in the doorway to my bedroom.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cReady?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nShe nodded, came over to my side and kissed me again.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe\u2019re finally on our way, Peter. We\u2019ll be away from here and there will be nothing and no one to stop us from being together\u2026 forever.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI nodded as Laura dragged me out to Mike\u2019s car and soon we were on our way to the airport.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThe flight I booked you on doesn\u2019t have many people, considering the time and day, so there shouldn\u2019t be much for you to worry about. Normally kids your age aren\u2019t allowed to fly by themselves\u2026 but I paid a little extra and they\u2019re going to\u2026 overlook that.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI nodded from the backseat as Laura held my hand.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSay thank you.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI nodded and blushed.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThank you Mike.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI could see Mike\u2019s eyes in the rear view mirror glance to my side before he nodded.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNo problem kiddo. Hope you have a better time with your dad.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI nodded as he focused on the road. Before I knew it, we were at the airport and a man in uniform was there to escort me inside.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, little man, I\u2019ll make sure you get on your flight.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI smiled and nodded.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThank you.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI turned to say goodbye to Mike, but paused when I saw him off to the side\u2026 talking to Laura. I strained my ears over the noise of the airport and heard just a little of what he was saying.\r  \n\r  \n\u201c\u2026 little young for you\u2026 I\u2019m sure you can\u2026 I\u2019ll handle her, like we agreed\u2026\u201d\r  \n\r  \nFrowning I started to head over to see what was going on when the airport attendant caught my attention.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThis way. We need to hurry to get you on your plane.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI nodded and felt Laura slide up next to me, taking my hand. I felt a sense of calm wash over me and all the thoughts I had before just seemed to\u2026 fade away. A smile crossed my face and soon I was on the place without a care in the world.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI wonder what it will be like living with dad\u2026\u201d\r  \n\r  \nSitting in the empty seat next to me, Laura just smiled.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cBetter than living with that bitch\u2026\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI laughed softly to myself, catching the eye of the flight attendant, who just stared at me before moving on.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAnything is better than living with her for a week.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nLaura nodded.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOr longer\u2026\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI smiled and yawned a little.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHow long is the flight?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nLaura smiled and looked out the window.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAnother couple of hours. Why don\u2019t you just sit back and relax. I\u2019ll wake you up when we land.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI smiled and let out another yawn.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOk\u2026 night.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nClosing my eyes, I failed to notice the two flight attendants who were staring at me in fear.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I opened my eyes again, we were landing in Colorado and I knew I\u2019d be seeing my dad again after close to five years.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be weird to see my dad and brother again. I wonder if they remember me?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nLaura smiled and nodded.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOf course they do, silly, they\u2019re your family\u2026 like me.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI nodded, not really paying attention to her words. I heard an announcement about seat belts and looked down to see mine was fastened. Laura just smiled and squeezed my hand as the plane bounced and came to a stop.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe\u2019re here. This should be fun\u2026\u201d\r  \n\r  \nNodding I waited until the seat belt light went off then opened it and stood up.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cFollow the others into the airport to the baggage area. We\u2019ll grab your suitcases and then head into the main area to look for your dad and brother.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI looked at Laura as she pointed toward the line of people standing in front of the exit. Nodding, I stood up and got in line. Slowly, the line of people headed inside and down a long hallway to a large circular belt with luggage riding along on it.\r  \n\r  \nIt took me a couple of minutes to grab my suitcases and then I turned and saw three police officers headed my way.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cExcuse me\u2026 I\u2019m looking for a Peter\u2026\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe officer said my last name and I slowly raised my hand. He walked over to me and crouched down in front of me.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHey son\u2026 um, can you come with me and my friends here? We need to talk to you about your mom.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI look out of the corner of my eye to see Laura nodding. I looked back at the officer and nodded. Giving me a sad smile, he took my hand and motioned to the other two officers to grab my luggage.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI really hate to be the one to tell you this, but there was an accident with the flight your mom was on. The plane crashed and a lot of people were hurt. Sadly a couple of them died\u2026 including your mom.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI felt a wave of panic fill me and then Laura\u2019s hand slid into mine and it all just\u2026 stopped. I could hear her voice in my head at the moment.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNod and look sad. Ask about Mike\u2026 then ask if your Dad is here or on his way to get you.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nBlinking I looked up at the officer and did as she said. He asked me for Mike\u2019s last name\u2026 but I didn\u2019t know it.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHe\u2019s her boyfriend and he paid for my ticket here to see my dad. Is my dad waiting for me outside somewhere?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe officer looked concerned and looked at one of the others.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe\u2019ll go ask and see. Why don\u2019t you describe Mike to me and I\u2019ll see if he\u2019s ok.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI described Mike as well as I could and the officer checked a piece of paper in his hand.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t match anyone who was taken to the hospital\u2026 or any of the dead. Let me check the flight manifest.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nHe pulled out another piece of paper and frowned.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a Mike or a Michael on that flight\u2026 and the seat your mother was in was the only one being used on that row. That\u2019s weird.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI just looked at him, confused by everything\u2026 when another officer came into the room.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHenry\u2026 there\u2019s no one here for the kid.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI looked at the officer and felt that feeling of panic coming back.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMy dad\u2019s not here?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe officer from before, Henry, asked me for my dad\u2019s name and address.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe\u2019ll have Sam here go check out your dad\u2019s house and see what\u2019s going on. How about you and I have a snack while we wait.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI gave Henry a nod and he led me over to a snack area and let me pick whatever I wanted. I got a soda and some chips and was soon in my own little world as I tried to process what had happened. I watched Henry until Sam came back and the two of them stepped away to talk.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cLaura\u2026 what happened to my mom?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nLaura, who had been slightly smiling all this time, just looked at me and grinned.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI took care of her\u2026 like I said I would. She hurt you. She hurt what was mine. No one gets to hurt what belongs to me.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI looked into her eyes and for a moment\u2026 there was something not quite human looking back at me\u2026 and then it was gone and Laura was back. Her face, however, looked strange for a moment before she licked her lips.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI forget sometimes why I claimed you. You keep getting stronger and stronger, my love. It\u2019s so delicious. I can\u2019t wait until\u2026 well, until later.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThat was the first time she called me that and I started to speak when suddenly everything went white and Henry was back in front of me again.\r  \n\r  \n\u201c\u2026 with me Peter. We\u2019ll need to take you to the station with us.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI blinked a few times and looked about in confusion.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHuh?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nHenry frowned.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDid you hear me? I said your Dad doesn\u2019t live where you told me, Peter. He moved three years ago and didn\u2019t leave a forwarding address. We\u2019re going to try to track him down, but you\u2019ll need to come to the station until we can find him.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nNodding, I felt Laura squeeze my hand and I stood up slowly. I felt numb again and just stared at him as he led me outside to a patrol car. Climbing in the back, I waited as they loaded my luggage into the trunk and then we were on our way.\r  \n\r  \nThings got fuzzy from that point forward. I don\u2019t really remember the next few days until everything snapped back in focus when Henry came into the room they rented me at a local hotel and with him was a woman. Laura grew instantly nervous and forced me back into the numb mode.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSay what I tell you to or else\u2026\u201d\r  \n\r  \nHer voice was loud and dark inside my head. I just nodded slightly as Henry and the woman talked to me. Apparently she was a social worker assigned to me with the death of my mother and with my father being absent.\r  \n\r  \n\u201c\u2026 where he is as every trace of him seems to have vanished. We did find your brother, but he\u2019s currently in the military and can\u2019t take care of you for another couple of years. As for your sister\u2026 we\u2019re sorry to let you know that she too has passed away.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI nodded and took a deep breath. I could hear Laura telling me what to say.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSo what happens to me until Jimmy gets out?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nHenry looked at the woman as she frowned.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou are the only one in your mother\u2019s will. She left you everything in her bank account as well as a few personal items. It seems the house you lived in was rented and that isn\u2019t an option anymore\u2026\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI felt another wave of numbing flood me mixed with excitement.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDoes this mean I will live by myself or will I have to go to a children\u2019s home.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe woman started to speak, then her eyes glazed over. Henry frowned for a moment then smiled and left the room. I watched the two of them, confused as to what was going on.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be declared an emancipated minor and with the money your mother left you\u2026 you\u2019ll be fairly well off.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nShe blinked for a moment then smiled again.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYour Uncle Michael has come forward saying you can live with him for as long as you like. Isn\u2019t that nice\u2026\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI nodded slowly as Laura made me speak.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYes that\u2019s great. Is he on his way?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe woman nodded and smiled.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHe\u2019s already here. He\u2019s filling out some paperwork downtown and should be here to get you in about an hour. I just need to have you sign some forms and then you will be emancipated and have full access to your mother\u2019s money.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nShe pulled out some paperwork and her eyes darted back and forth fearfully\u2026 like an animal caught in a trap. She winced and then smiled once more as she pointed where I was to sign.\r  \n\r  \nLooking at the paperwork, Laura made me sign where needed and then everything went fuzzy once more.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I could think again, I was sitting in the backseat of a car I\u2019d never seen before. I was alone and in the front seat was Mike, mom\u2019s boyfriend, and Laura.\r  \n\r  \n\u201c\u2026 to my estate to have him prepared. We\u2019ve done enough here and it\u2019s time to be moving on. He\u2019ll be entering puberty soon and I want to have everything prepared for when it is time to produce my newest clutch of daughters. He\u2019s perfect and he will give my daughters an advantage over my sisters and their hideous spawn.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI blinked, not understanding what she was talking about.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you. I\u2019m surprised the boy has as much power as he does. His mother was idiotically dull and a complete null. Did it all come from his father?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nLaura smiled and shrugged.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWho\u2019s to say\u2026 but we\u2019ll never know. By now, he\u2019s gone the same path as my precious\u2019 mother and it won\u2019t matter anyway.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nPower? What was she talking about\u2026 and why were the two of them talking to each other about me.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat about the brother?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nLaura laughed and for a moment, she changed. Gone was my perfect Laura and in her place was a much older woman with bright red hair and very tan skin.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHe\u2019ll suffer the same fate as the rest. I\u2019ve spent years creating my new perfect husband. No one is going to take Peter away from me\u2026 not now, not ever.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI made the mistake then of breathing loudly and she turned her head to look at me.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cShit\u2026 he\u2019s awake.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWhite light filled my eyes and everything went black.\r  \n\r  \nThat was a few minutes ago\u2026 or God knows how many years\u2026 depending on how you look at it. I don\u2019t remember anything else from that moment until earlier when I suddenly woke up lying in a bed\u2026 somewhere.\r  \n\r  \nStanding up\u2026 I looked around and saw a full length mirror nearby. Walking over to it, I was surprised to see a grown up man looking back at me. I looked somewhere between 18 and 20 years old, maybe older\u2026 but I had no idea how old I really was.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cPeter\u2026\u201d\r  \n\r  \nTurning my head, I saw Mike standing in the doorway. He was covered in blood and looked like he\u2019d almost been cut in half.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAre you in there Peter? The magic should have let you go when\u2026 when they killed her.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI blinked and looked at him for a moment before nodding.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHow many years has it been?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nMike shook his head as he pushed clothes into my hands.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAlmost ten years. Her sisters\u2026 they invaded, killed her and her daughters. They\u2019re on their way to find you and take you back home with them. If you don\u2019t want to go to back to sleep\u2026 you need to run.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI stood there, confused as no memory came back to me\u2026 but I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to just let someone else put me back into captivity. I looked at the clothing and started getting dressed.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhere do I go? How do I get out of here? Where even is here?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nMike came closer to me and shoved a backpack into my hands once I was dressed,  then tugged on a ring I didn\u2019t even know was on my right hand.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThe ring will let you through the gates. It will take them too long to lock you out, but you must hurry. Inside the backpack is everything she took from your home\u2026 what remains at least\u2026 along with all the identification and paperwork she made you sign ten years ago.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI looked at the ring and then nodded.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cRun\u2026 down the stairs and out the door. There is a courtyard that leads to a large metal gate. It should be open by now. Go through it and into the forest beyond. Run\u2026 and keep running\u2026 until you come to a white fence with a purple glow above it. Don\u2019t climb over the fence. Instead, run alongside it until you find a gate. It should open to your ring. Go through and don\u2019t look back. You\u2019ll be\u2026 somewhere else\u2026 once you do.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nMike gasped in pain and swallowed hard.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAnywhere is better than here\u2026 now go.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nNodding I ran to the door of the bedroom\u2026 I could now see it was.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThank you\u2026\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI turned to look back at Mike\u2026 but he was dead, a pile of blood pooling underneath his collapsed body. Taking a deep breath, I followed his instructions and made my way out of what I now understood to be a castle of some kind\u2026 moving into the forest and eventually to the fence.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m at the gate now and I can hear screaming behind me. The sound of barking dogs\u2026 or worse\u2026 mixed with the roar of things I\u2019m too scared to even think about.\r  \n\r  \nThe gate is open and I\u2019m stepping through. I can hear them getting closer.\r  \n\r  \nI don\u2019t know where this will take me\u2026 but\u2026 anywhere is better than here...",

    "postText": "I\u2019m what\u2019s called a \u201dset collector\u201d; I find and restore sets of vintage auctionables and sell them as complete sets for high-end clients.\n\nI originally came out to Lewisburg to put a bid on a near-complete set of original The Phantom-comics. The collection was about a dozen short, but none of the missing issues were that rare. It was a slam-dunk. It might take some time to get them graded, but if I could find a serious buyer that wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\n\nI won the bid and was ready to call it a day when they announced a surprise item.\n\nThese are always good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA complete 1923 Chimeric Challenger 3000-piece puzzle.\n\n*Holy shit.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor those not in the know, the Chimeric Challenger is famously misprinted. They were discontinued because the cutting machine had some kind of malfunction. Some pieces were stuck together and had to be cut with scissors to be assembled. Others were just plain wood, completely missing the print. Some had entire segments missing from the box. It was a commercial failure specifically because there were seemingly no complete sets. So to have a complete 3000-piece Chimeric Challenger, their largest and final creation?\n\nThat\u2019s big money.\n\nI got it for $2,600. I\u2019ve seen incomplete sets go for about $8,000, so I could probably get past 15k if I could find the right collector. The only problem was that, while the previous owner insisted that it was complete, there was no certificate. So I would have to put it together, just to verify.\n\nHonestly, I was way more excited about the Chimeric Challenger than my Phantom-set. It was good money, but this? This was unique. Rare. An actual challenge to put together and put into the hands of the right person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got back home. I was greeted by my wall of collectables, amassed from years of digging through countless yard sales and storage units. My crowning achievement was a vintage Mickey Mouse pocket watch placed under a little glass dome, lit with a mild yellow RGB light. The thing wasn\u2019t that rare, or expensive, but it was special to me. It was the exact watch my mom hadn\u2019t been able to afford me for my sixth birthday. It represented everything I\u2019d grown into; someone who found things. Someone with the confidence and means to get what I want.\n\nI pulled a half-nighter finding the missing Phantom issues. By 4 am I\u2019d found all but two, and those were just standard issues from the 80\u2019s. A bit tricky to find a seller, but dirt cheap. I just had to find the right shop.\n\nAnd yet, I could barely get any sleep. I was so excited to get started with the Chimeric Challenger. I put out my white cotton gloves, set my alarm for 8, and put a timer on my coffee maker. As soon as that bell rang, I\u2019d shoot out of bed like a boxer ready for round one.\n\nAs I closed my eyes that night, a single thought itched the back of my mind;\n\nI didn\u2019t have the slightest idea what was printed on the puzzle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a few hours of twisting and turning I was finally standing next to the box with a steaming cup of coffee, ready to go. I put on my headset and gave my west coast guy, Lenny, a call. He was usually up at night, chatting with some of his east Asian clients.\n\nHe picked up on the first signal.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019cha got?\u201d he answered.\n\n\u201cYou know any puzzle people, Lenny?\u201d I asked. \u201cHigh-end?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we talking Rachel Page stuff? Collector shit? Curios?\u201d\n\n\u201cI sent you a picture.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Chimeric Challenger came in a plain wooden box with a simple company logo on the side. The logo, a sunflower print, had faded to a shade of grey; a far cry from the original azure blue.\n\n\u201cChallenger?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many missing?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\n\n\u201cComplete set.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. And check this out.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sent him another picture. This time of the side of the box, where you could kind of tell the number \u201c3000\u201d from the remaining print. Again, faded to a grey.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you got a full set. 3000 pieces.\u201d\n\n\u201cFull set.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got it verified?\u201d\n\n\u201cGonna put it together,\u201d I sighed. \u201cBut yeah, it\u2019s a complete set.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t checked it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but-\u201c\n\n\u201cLook, you can\u2019t throw around \u2018complete set\u2019 before you get it verified. These things are notorious.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking you to keep your beady weasel eyes open. Make some calls.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call you a dumbass for not verifying it, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious. This is big league collector stuff. Minnesota original print.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if you get it verified, I\u2019ll shower you with roses.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLenny hung up, and I got to work. I took pictures of the box in every angle, noting the company address on the bottom right. Tomskog, Minnesota. Original print.\n\nI put on my cotton gloves and carefully opened the box.\n\nThere were 30 identical plastic bags inside, each numbered to contain 100 pieces. Unfortunately, the seal was already broken. That probably set me back a couple of thousands.\n\nI photographed everything and opened the first bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went through all the pieces, slowly, and carefully. I double-checked them for bad prints and weak tabs. Putting it together would be the last thing I did.\n\nIt took me roughly 4 hours to get to the 1000-piece mark. So far so good.\n\nI hadn\u2019t put the pieces together yet, but I saw some rough shades of blue, black, white skin, and a hammer. I got the impression that it was a portrait, possibly of a worker. Maybe a factory worker? I could see something rough and metallic, possibly a printing press. I saw some kind of denim texture.\n\nI spent all day checking the rest of the pieces, sending updates to Lenny along the way. The thing was pristine, not a single wobbly tab or weak print. These pieces had probably never been properly assembled.\n\nBy 9 pm, I was completely done. Every piece checked, verified, and returned to their plastic bags. They were all perfect. Well, as perfect as a 100-year-old puzzle could be. Now I just had to put it together, to make sure there were no misprints in context. There could be some kind of mix-up that I\u2019d missed.\n\nBy the end of the night, Lenny told me he had a potential buyer. They were only interested in a complete set, so I had to put it together to make sure. But if it was legit, we were looking at an 18-19k payout, plus commission fees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day, I ordered the final issues of the Phantom and got ready to put the puzzle together. I put on an audio book, uploaded all my pictures from the previous day, and got to work.\n\nNow, putting together a 3000-piece puzzle takes time. If I spent all day working on it, about 12 hours, it\u2019d still take me several days to finish. Probably another day since I had to be careful about the pieces.\n\nSo I cracked my knuckles, turned off all notifications, and zoned out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround lunchtime I had put together a few edge pieces and a dozen pieces showing a hand holding a hammer. A dirty, labor-roughened hand with black nails and deep blue bruises around the knuckles. I took a short break. I covered the pieces with a cotton cloth and made myself a sandwich.\n\nThe Phantom collection was basically complete, so I put some feelers out looking for a buyer. I found the final issues and placed an order.\n\nMost of the time, my collections don\u2019t come to me complete. The Chimeric Challenger was a bit different that way; usually I had to track down missing pieces or incomplete sets. That was part of the job. Having it served to me like this felt like cheating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I got back to the puzzle, I got the sense that something was different. I removed the flowery cotton cover, taking in the smell of the old wood.\n\nI could\u2019ve sworn I\u2019d only put 12 pieces together for the arm.\n\nAnd yet, there were 13 connected pieces.\n\nStrange.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you solve puzzles, you start with the edges. That was my strategy too, but I couldn\u2019t keep myself from assembling whatever random pieces I found along the way. Mostly background pieces showing parts of shelves and metal flooring.\n\nLong after the sun had set, I tore myself away from the puzzle. I put the cotton cover back, chugged a Red Bull, and double-checked my socials. I had a lot of missed calls. Missed calls are often missed opportunities. I couldn\u2019t afford those, but this had to get done.\n\nI spent another few hours rifling through offers, tips, and various rumors. Apparently, there\u2019d been some talk about the Chimeric Challenger. Maybe Lenny asking around stirred something up.\n\nI went through every post about it. The consensus was clear; there were no complete Chimeric Challenger sets. A few of them had managed to put together complete sets by combining boxes, but that only worked for the 100- and 500-piece sets.\n\n\u201cThe 3000-piece sets were all unique,\u201d one poster said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they didn\u2019t spoil the picture on the box. It was a collector\u2019s item.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was just about to click on a link when I heard a sound. It sounded like a click, but it didn\u2019t come from my mouse. Instead I looked over at the covered puzzle.\n\nI walked over to it, scratching my eyes. I just stood there, looking at the flowery print of the cotton cover. Had I really heard something, or was it just sleep deprivation?\n\nEven if I\u2019d heard something, what made me think it came from the puzzle?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut no. I wasn\u2019t that person anymore. I was confident. I got what I wanted.\n\nI removed the cover and counted the assembled pieces.\n\nEdges looked fine. No problem there. But the hand with the hammer?\n\n14 pieces. Not 13.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI counted, recounted, and recounted again. Had it been 14 all along? I hadn\u2019t written \u201813\u2019 anywhere, and I was starting to doubt myself. Puzzles don\u2019t assemble themselves.\n\nI counted the pieces so many times that the image of that hand holding the hammer burned into my eyes. I wiped the sweat from my brow, reminding myself to put on clean cotton gloves the next day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 14,\u201d I said out loud, putting it down on a post-it. \u201cIt is 14 pieces. Not 13, it was 14.\u201d\n\nI covered it back up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat night I slept like a rock. I dreamt about laborers. People with shovels, hammers, saws, and chisels. I dreamt about a hazy workshop full of acidic compounds. People yelling back and forth. A large man with an anchor tattooed on his forearm. A 12-year-old with a bucket handing out cups of water poured from a hand-carved wooden ladle. The smell of oil, tar, and something sweet. A flower press, making a potent dye.\n\nThe workers all had blue hands. All of them. All except the foreman.\n\nHe wielded a hammer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething clicked.\n\nI woke up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019d only been asleep for an hour, but I was shaking and wide awake. I tried going back to sleep, but there was a struggle in the back of my head. Part of me was telling me to stop being an idiot. Part of me wanted to go back to count. It had been 12 pieces. Then it was 13. Then 14.\n\nIt had been 13. I had to stop doubting myself.\n\nI cursed out loud and got up. This was the final time. I stomped up to the table, removed the cover, and counted. I didn\u2019t even bother to check the edge pieces.\n\n16. There were two more pieces assembled, completing the hammer.\n\nI leaned back in my chair, looking at the post-it note. It clearly said 14. There was no doubt anymore; there were more pieces assembled now than earlier that night.\n\nBut what the hell did that mean?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI put the cloth back over the puzzle and just watched it. I must\u2019ve sat there over an hour, nodding in and out of a restless sleep. At one point I didn\u2019t know if I was awake or not. My eyes were open, but I didn\u2019t really register anything I was seeing.\n\nAnd there, in that dreamlike moment, I saw something move under the cotton cover.\n\nFollowed by another wooden *click*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI must\u2019ve fallen asleep, as I woke up hours later; still sitting in my chair.\n\nI had some missed calls, a few items that had to be sent, and a few Phantom issues to pick up at the post office.\n\nAnd yet, I felt uneasy leaving the Chimeric Challenger. I tried telling myself I\u2019d imagined it, but I couldn\u2019t fool myself. Instead, I put my hand on the cotton cloth and took a deep breath.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to know. I didn\u2019t want to count them. I didn\u2019t want there to be more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust as I steeled myself, my phone rang. Lenny. I breathed a sigh of relief. Saved by the bell.\n\n\u201cLenny, my guy,\u201d I answered. \u201cGot any good news?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this is legit, we\u2019re looking at a paycheck. Not table scraps, a fat double-quarter pounder paycheck. I can\u2019t find a single person with a complete 3000-piece set.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou telling me we\u2019re in the money, Lenny? That what you\u2019re telling me?\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine big brown sacks with dollar signs on \u2018em, and the satisfaction of proving me wrong. But you gotta verify it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorking on it. I\u2019ll send you a progress pic.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill do.\u201d\n\n\u201cBig dollar signs, like\u2026 like you\u2019re a cartoon villain robbing a bank.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very clear picture, Lenny, thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet to work.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked up at my Mickey Mouse pocket watch.\n\nI\u2019d earned it. I\u2019d been sure of myself, and I made it work.\n\nThis would be no different.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt took me about two hours to finish up my chores. Sent out a couple of surplus items, picked up a few of the Phantom comics, downed a box of gas station sushi, and got back home.\n\nI substituted my audio book for rock n\u2019 roll and got into the vibe. I didn\u2019t even count the pieces, I just started putting them together. Sorting them by color. Mouthing the words to \u2018Detroit Rock City\u2019 while looking for matching boot pieces. This was work; that\u2019s all that mattered. The guy in the picture had his labor, I had mine.\n\nI kept taking progress pics to send to Lenny later. This\u2019d be another full day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stopped for a dinner break at about 6pm. I heated up some canned ravioli and reviewed the pictures. It was fun just to see how far I\u2019d come. I\u2019d finished the entire frame and started working my way in. I\u2019d gotten a large chunk of metal flooring in, connected to a large segment of background wall. At least 600 pieces, all in all.\n\nThen, I noticed something.\n\nI went back and forth between my pictures. I tried arranging them, putting one over the other, making sure they were the same size.\n\nI couldn\u2019t get the arm to overlay. All the other pieces were fine, but not the arm with the hammer.\n\nIt was as if it wasn\u2019t in the same angle from one picture to the next.\n\nAs if it\u2019d moved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked over at the flowery cloth, feeling that icy block of doubt sink back into my stomach. Without all the music, without the bravado, it was just me and this\u2026 mystery.\n\nOne by one, I sent the progress pics to Lenny. And as I hit send on the last one, he called me up.\n\n\u201cLenny,\u201d I started. \u201cYou gotta-\u201c\n\n\u201cI got the guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe guy. A client. He\u2019s interested.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, sure, but-\u201c\n\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. He\u2019s on the other line. He wants to talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need a second?\u201d\n\n\u201cLenny, there\u2019s an issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this gonna keep us from making bank?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took a deep breath. I wasn\u2019t sure. I couldn\u2019t be.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2026 I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019re on in five.\u201d\n\nThere was an electronic tone, followed by two signals. All of a sudden Lenny was off the line. There was a stranger on the other end. A stranger with an old, wheezing, voice. I sat there listening to him breathe for a few seconds. Clearly a smoker.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 you got the full set?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI think so, yeah. Putting it together as we speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nThere was an urgency. Like he\u2019d waited for just the right time to say it; preparing himself. It was the clearest thing he\u2019d said so far.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d he repeated. \u201cTear it apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t\u2026 can\u2019t you feel it?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked back at the flowery cloth. Had it really moved the other night? Had the picture changed?\n\n12 pieces. 13. 14. 16. I hadn\u2019t even counted them since. Two dozen? Three?\n\n\u201cThey are incomplete by design. By\u2026 necessity. It shouldn\u2019t be complete.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake sure of it. Disassemble it, separate the pieces, and never look at it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI-I\u2026 I can\u2019t just\u2026\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got up from my chair, seeing the setting sun bounce off the glass dome protecting the Mickey Mouse pocket watch.\n\nI wanted this. I wanted this, and I was going to get it.\n\n\u201cIf you want to take it off my hands, I\u2019m sure Lenny will get you a fair price,\u201d I sighed. \u201cBut if you excuse me, I got work to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d\n\nI hung up. And for the rest of the night, I didn\u2019t bother counting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called it a day just past midnight. I faceplanted into bed, leaving the playlist rolling. I\u2019d just catch a few hours of sleep, then get back to it. I wasn\u2019t going to drag this out. This was business, and I was going to handle it.\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t help myself from dreaming. Maybe the fumes from the box got to me. Maybe it was just a different, intrusive, headspace. Either way, I imagined myself back in that hazy workshop.\n\nI imagined myself waking up. A man with blue hands shaking my shoulder. Our lunch break was over, and I was slacking off. I had this mind-numbing task of putting the same varnish on wooden boxes, over and over and over. The smell was so strong that I couldn\u2019t even feel it anymore.\n\nThere was a noise further down the hall. A hammer coming down, again and again.\n\nScreams. Pleading.\n\n*Flesh*.\n\nWe knew better than to stop. You didn\u2019t quit this job.\n\n*No one did.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up to a sudden clatter. Something falling onto the floor.\n\nMy eyes shot open. There were puzzle pieces scattered across the carpet.\n\nAnd a bloody hammer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpecks of blood covered the flowery cotton cover. The hammer just lay there on the floor, clear as day. A few puzzle pieces had fallen off the table.\n\nI picked up the hammer, feeling the weight of it in my hand. A sticky handle covered in loose strands of hair.\n\nI pulled the cotton cover aside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Chimeric Challenger was almost complete.\n\nThe puzzle revealed a man in denim overalls. Covered in cuts, bruises, and scars. The only thing missing was his head, that hadn\u2019t been put together yet.\n\nHe didn\u2019t have a hammer in his hand anymore. He did, however, have colored hands. But they weren\u2019t blue, like the workers I\u2019d dreamt of.\n\nThey were blood red.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019d forgotten to turn notifications back on. I had hundreds. Row after row of texts from the same number, over and over. All of them telling me to please, destroy the puzzle. Burn it. Throw it away. Tear the pieces apart and just walk away.\n\nMissed calls. Offers to pay me to get rid of it. Calls from Lenny. Calls from unknown numbers.\n\nPleading, desperate messages. The last message was sent just minutes before I woke up, asking me to please \u2018save his life\u2019. For his children\u2019s sake. For his grandchildren.\n\nAnd finally, an e-mail from Lenny.\n\n\u201cNo wonder he wants it that bad,\u201d Lenny wrote. \u201cHe\u2019s a Tomskog native. His dad probably helped make the thing.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy pulse raced. I held the bloody hammer in my hand. This was real. This wasn\u2019t a trick of the mind. There were only about 40 pieces left to assemble.\n\nNo one quits the job.\n\nEnough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI picked it all up and showed it into the box, abandoning all care and common sense. I showed it all in there, bending the tabs and snapping the corners. I saw the pieces bend and break, hearing the wood snap. I forced the lid shut, put it under my arm, and left.\n\nI was going to burn it in the yard, but it was snowing outside. I decided to throw it off a bridge instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere\u2019s this bridge not too far from where I live where the water never really freezes. I drove up there, parked, and got out. I brought the hammer.\n\nI put the puzzle down and just started smashing it with the hammer. I watched a flock of red birds take flight, frightened by the sudden noise. Finally I heaved it all over the edge; watching the broken wooden pieces plop into the river. As the pieces sailed into the rushing water, I felt this immense sense of relief. And with that, I dropped the hammer into the river as well.\n\nThe color from the broken puzzle pieces had given my hands a faint sheen of blue. I used some snow to scrub it off.\n\nI texted Lenny, telling him the puzzle was incomplete. I didn\u2019t even bother to check his response. I\u2019d wasted so much time and money on this, but I still felt like I\u2019d dodged a bullet. Like I\u2019d been on the cusp of something terrible.\n\nI headed home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spent the rest of the day trying to find a buyer for the Phantom collection. I\u2019d gained the attention of a few big names. Apparently, the rumor of me having a Chimeric Challenger had also gotten out; there were quite a few messages about it. I made up a copy-paste response to get rid of them.\n\nI tried my best just to get back to work, ignoring the puzzle and everything about it. I didn\u2019t want to know what\u2019d happened. I didn\u2019t want to think about it. And yet, I could still see some blue powder under my fingernails.\n\nThat night, just before bed, I scrubbed myself clean. But no matter how hard I scrubbed my hands I could still see little blue stains on my skin.\n\nMaybe it wasn\u2019t really there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat night I could barely sleep at all. I fell in and out of consciousness, as if my body was keeping me awake. And still, I caught some snippets of another life. A life that also had blue powder on its hands at one point.\n\nI imagined people putting down their tools. Someone getting beaten to death for insubordination. The 12-year-old boy putting down his bucket of water. Finally, a hammer raised even at him.\n\nThen, a gunshot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy eyes were wide open. I sat up, letting my legs fall off the edge of the bed. I dug my toes into the carpet. I tried to calm down, to let myself rest.\n\nThen I felt something brush against my toe. Something at the edge of the carpet.\n\nA puzzle piece. It must\u2019ve bounced off when the pieces fell off the table.\n\nIt depicted the top of a bald man\u2019s head, with a gunshot wound in the forehead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe eyes in the puzzle piece turned to me, meeting my gaze.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Glass shattered.***\n\n***Footsteps.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hurried into my closet, hiding behind my collection of robes. I heard uneven footsteps fumble their way inside. Water dripping onto the hardwood floor in the hallway. Something metallic brushing against the wall.\n\nIt was dark, but I could see the outline of it as it stepped into my bedroom.\n\nA body, broken. A man with every bone twisted by hammer blows. A wheezing, rattling breath from a vibrating tongue. The top of his head was missing.\n\nThe man from the puzzle. The Chimeric Challenger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI held his puzzle piece in my hand.\n\nHe used his hammer as a cane for the blind, feeling his way forward, brushing it against the walls. As soon as he found the bed where I\u2019d slept he lost his composure. He made this unearthly sound, ripping the covers and pillows into pieces, waving the hammer around with his broken limbs.\n\nHe could barely stand on his ruined legs. Every step, every swing, was agony. I could hear the rage and frustration bubbling up from his exposed throat. The hammer bringing down paintings, pictures, shelves, and my priceless collectables.\n\nAll of a sudden, the doors to the closet were ripped from the hinges.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBroken fingers wrapped around my throat. I held up the final puzzle piece like a shield, hoping it would all just go away.\n\n\u201cTake it!\u201d I screamed. \u201cJust fucking take it!\u201d\n\nBut there was no discussion. No thought. He just started beating me to death with that goddamn hammer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat first blow connected with my jaw, breaking it. The second hit fractured my right upper arm. It was so fast that I didn\u2019t even understand what was happening. The third hit connected with my shoulder. I didn\u2019t even realize I\u2019d dropped the puzzle piece.\n\nThe dark turned red, and for a moment I could feel the texture of metal flooring against my cheek. I could see the haze of the workshop.\n\nI\u2019d tried to quit.\n\nThe foreman wasn\u2019t having it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFingers grabbing the roots of my hair. More hammer blows. My forehead burning. My head ringing. My world started spinning as my inner ear gave up.\n\nAnother blow. Another. I tried pleading for help, but I couldn\u2019t form words through my broken jaw.\n\nInstead I just lay there, wheezing, just like the foreman.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of a sudden, it stopped.\n\nA hammer clattered to the ground.\n\nI saw the glass dome with my Mickey Mouse pocket watch; it was still intact, resting on my bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted this. I wanted to live.\n\nI grabbed the hammer, flipped it, and used it to drag myself across the floor. I kept losing my grip from the bleeding.\n\nBut I made it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonths of physical therapy. Dozens of surgeries, and I still can\u2019t lift my arm over my head. When I stretch one way, I can feel this deep ache still lingering in my jaw.\n\nTurns out he accidentally smashed the final puzzle piece when he tried to beat me to death.\n\nI guess, in a strange way, he destroyed himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I still see people looking to complete sets of the Chimeric Challenge puzzles. There are 8 auctions for various pieces going on right now. Some for 300-pieces, one looking to complete a set for a 1000-piece puzzle.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking that we please, as a community, never talk of these again.",

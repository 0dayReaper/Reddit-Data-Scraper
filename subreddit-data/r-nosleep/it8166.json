    "postText": "Growing up, I thought everyone had a second family in their basement. In retrospect, I understand how ridiculous that sounds\u2026 but it was all I\u2019d ever known.\n\nI knew that every night, my dad tented the leftovers from dinner with foil, got up without a word, and carried the plate to the basement. I\u2019d listen from my room as he lumbered down the creaking steps, held my breath to hear the muffled mumblings of his greeting.\n\nI knew that every morning, he\u2019d make the trip downstairs to see his second family off before work, then kiss me on the top of my head and ruffle my hair as he walked out.\n\nI knew that each Christmas, he\u2019d bring a sack of brightly wrapped packages downstairs in a Santa suit.\n\nI knew that my dad had a second family in the basement, and it seemed so normal that I thought *everyone* else did too.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget the first time I asked my mom about them. I was young \u2013 maybe five \u2013 when I finally found the words to ask: \u201cMommy, why can\u2019t I play with the people in the basement?\u201d\n\nMy mom was the human embodiment of frenetic energy, an organic perpetual motion machine. Always pacing, or cleaning, or stirring a pot. Always with a lit cigarette tucked between her yellowing fingers.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget that, as that question hung in the air, she finally *stopped* for the first time. Her stillness was unsettling in a way I can\u2019t quite explain.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about them,\u201d she rushed, chasing the hurried statement with a lengthy drag off her cigarette. She blew a plume of smoke out the opened window before leaning down to meet me at face level, her bloodshot eyes mere inches from my own. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to play with the kids, but the kids need Daddy.\u201d\n\nShe paused again, the haunting image of her at a standstill etching itself into my mind permanently. Finally, she muttered, \u201cDaddy needs them too.\u201d\n\nThat night, I heard my mom shrieking at my dad in their bedroom. I was surprised that they didn\u2019t know that I knew, more shocked \u2013 frightened, even \u2013 to find that they didn\u2019t *want* me to know. Most of all, they didn\u2019t want me to tell anyone at school \u2013 anyone at all, really.\n\nAfter that night, everything was different. My dad only tented the leftovers after dinner, only brought the food downstairs after I\u2019d gone to bed. He stopped visiting them in the mornings altogether. My mom started acting differently, too. I\u2019d always noticed that she was\u2026 distant from my dad; had always noticed how she bristled under his touch, how she stole away to the other side of the room whenever he entered. But it got worse after that\u2026 as a kid, I felt deeply guilty. I felt like I\u2019d ruined my parents\u2019 marriage.\n\nBut I was just a kid, and I was curious. My mom meant to dissuade me from asking more questions, but she accidentally gave away something that made me even *more* curious \u2013 the downstairs family had kids, maybe kids my own age to play with.\n\nI wanted \u2013 *needed* to know about them, in the way that little kids *need* to understand all of the strangeness of this chaotic world, *need* to make sense of the nonsense that surrounds us daily. The nonsense that we become acclimated to as adults but struggle with endlessly as children, like a puzzle or a riddle or a word problem on a math test about buying eighty watermelons.\n\nAnother change following that critical night: the basement door was fitted with sturdy lock. Even still, I needed to know\u2026 there\u2019s something horribly dreadful about finding out that a second basement family is abnormal, something more horrible still about not knowing who or *why.* By the time I was seven, I made up my mind to get to the bottom of it.\n\nTo avoid getting in trouble, I could only investigate when three conditions were met: I was home from school, my dad was still at work, and my mom wasn\u2019t around to catch me. These circumstances rarely overlapped, but the first time I came home from school to find that my dad\u2019s car wasn\u2019t in the garage and my mom\u2019s endless movement had driven her to the point of exhaustion, I threw off my shoes and crept to the basement door, quiet in my sock feet.\n\nAnd then, I knocked.\n\nIt was a quiet knock, for fear of waking my mom from her nap, but it was a knock, nonetheless. It was more than just a knock, too, it was an initiation, an invitation, a confrontation of my life\u2019s greatest \u2013 and most terrifying \u2013 mystery.\n\nI jumped when a gentle knock returned from the other side. It was almost immediate\u2026 like the person on the other side had been *waiting* for me. The thought froze me in place for a moment, but I knew I didn\u2019t any have time to waste.\n\nMy mouth felt suddenly of sandpaper and chalk, but I leaned into the door to whisper, \u201chi.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d\n\nIt was a little girl, her voice sweet yet timid. Like testing the keys on a piano for the first time.\n\n\u201cI-I\u2019m Ricky. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\nA long pause.\n\n\u201cLila. My brother\u2019s is Isaac, but he doesn\u2019t talk so good. But he\u2019s still little. Mommy says he\u2019ll start talking when he\u2019s ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s three of you down there?\u201d\n\n\u201cMhmm,\u201d she replied simply, as if the entire situation felt as wholly normal for her as it had for me, on the opposite side of the basement door. \u201cDaddy comes to visit sometimes, though, so I guess there\u2019s four.\u201d\n\nMy eyes widened as a flurry of questions began to sprout in my mind, but I heard my mom start to stir in her room. I sped down the hallway and into the playroom. I busied my hands with my toys, but my mind was somewhere else\u2026 the sprouts of questions continued to grow rapidly, soon overtaking my thoughts like an unruly patch of weeds.\n\nAnd like weeds, the questions were stubborn; hard to \u2013 *impossible* to get rid of. The roots of the situation and its implication unraveled, stretched through my whole body. Fear planted itself firmly in my belly as I was forced to confront the possibility that I didn\u2019t really know my dad, didn\u2019t really know my own family at all. If my dad was Lila\u2019s dad, too, what did that mean for me? For my family?\n\nAnd why wasn\u2019t she allowed to come out of the basement?\n\nOver the next couple years, I stole away to the basement door in those rare moments of freedom. I got to know Lila, got to like her and eventually even to love her \u2013 she was my best friend. As a kid, I was pretty lonely; my classmates shied away from me for reasons I couldn\u2019t quite understand, like something about me was inherently repellant to my peers. I only had one friend at school.\n\nAnd at home, I had Lila.\n\nAs we spoke more, a never-ending stream of back and forth questioning crammed into the briefest moments of time, we both came to understand the differences between us, between our lives and our circumstances. The differences that at first felt so *normal* grew bigger and sharper and scarier than either of us could comprehend.\n\nThe unfairness of it all became impossible to ignore.\n\nLila lamented that she wasn\u2019t allowed to go to school, that she couldn\u2019t go outside to play or make friends or ride bikes around the cul-de-sac in the summer until the streetlamps flickered on and the cicadas started to scream. She even longed for the things I loathed most\u2013 homework, rinsing off my dishes after dinner, tidying up my room each Sunday morning.\n\nShe said she\u2019d lived in that basement all of her life, was probably even *born* down there. She couldn\u2019t remember anything different before being locked up in the cold and musty room.\n\nI\u2019m ashamed to admit this, but, eventually\u2026 I couldn\u2019t manage the guilt I felt for living the life Lila never had, *could* never have in my mind. I was so young, so na\u00efve\u2026 I didn\u2019t know how to manage the situation anymore, so I did the only thing I could think of.\n\nI stopped trying.\n\nI stopped visiting Lila. No more secret, whispered exchanges; no more quick knocks on the door just to let her know that I was there, that anyone at all was there for her. Days and weeks and months and years trickled by with Lila never quite leaving my thoughts, but with her existence instead\u2026 *compartmentalized*.\n\nConfined to the basement of my own mind.\n\nAt home, it was harder to keep thoughts of her locked away. When my dad brought her dinner hours past my bedtime, I\u2019d lay awake warm in my bed. Sometimes I\u2019d hear her scream. Sometimes I\u2019d hear the tray clatter to the floor, the plate fracturing on impact. Sometimes I\u2019d hear her crying \u2013 awful, painful sobs \u2013 while I assembled new Lego sets in the playroom.\n\nSometimes she\u2026 she would call out my name. I\u2019ll never forgive myself for this \u2013 I hate myself for it, and I *deserve* to \u2013 but I ignored her every time.\n\nWorst of all, though, was when she started knocking.\n\nI was finishing up my science homework for the day when the first knock came.\n\nA quiet knock\u2026 but a knock, nonetheless. An initiation, an invitation, a *confrontation*.\n\nMy blood ran cold as I realized where it was coming from; *who* it was coming from.\n\nI hopped on my bike and didn\u2019t come home until dinner was on the table.\n\nThat night, I heard my dad scream back at Lila for the first time. Yelled for her to *knock it off* with all the knocking. He took care of her, of her little brother and her mom, and that he could only do that if she stayed in the basement, if she stayed quiet.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t persuaded, though, and her knocking only grew more frequent, and *louder*. I was about ten years old by then, so I had a little more freedom\u2026 all the freedom in the world, compared to Lila. I avoided my house at all costs, only returning in the evenings, where I\u2019d be greeted immediately by the knocking.\n\nBy then, it was less knocking and more ramming the total weight of her body into the door. My mother took to vacuuming the house obsessively just to cover up the noise. She wouldn\u2019t even look my dad in the eye anymore. I imagined the bruises blooming on Lila\u2019s shoulder, up and down the length of her arm. If it hurt her, she didn\u2019t let on.\n\nShe didn\u2019t stop.\n\nSleep became a distant memory, leaving me dazed and irritable and confused and \u2013 most of all \u2013 terrified. I began showing up at my schoolfriend\u2019s \u2013 now my *only* friend\u2019s \u2013 house unannounced just to escape Lila\u2019s knocking.\n\nHis parents clearly didn\u2019t like me, and tensions rose between the two of us kids, escalating to a boiling point that ended in a fight. I slugged him in the gut, and he returned with the words that broke me \u2013 broke *everything*.\n\nA blow far more powerful than he could\u2019ve delivered with small hands balled up into fists.\n\n\u201cMy mom says you\u2019re a *bastard*, that your mom\u2019s a *whore!*\u201d\n\nI had to look up the words in my dictionary when I got home.\n\nI had to gather the courage to, once again, ask a difficult question: \u201cMom\u2026 am I a bastard?\u201d\n\nI had to watch my mom lose her momentum, to *stop* again.\n\nI had to watch what little light she had left in her go out.\n\nI had to sit there as she left the room, had to sit there spilling hot tears as the knocking kicked up again, each powerful thrust against the door wracking my mind, a painful reminder that Lila was coming for me.\n\nBut, my mom came back, and she returned with an old newspaper clipping in her hands, worn at the edges. She held it to her chest as she finally \u2013 *finally* \u2013 told me the truth about Lila, about Dad\u2019s second family in the basement.\n\nI was young, but I needed to know. My mom knew it, too.\n\nThrough choking sobs, she told me about my dad\u2019s old family, the one he\u2019d had and *made* before he met her. The horrible mistake they\u2019d made, the one that gave her the best thing she\u2019d ever had in her life but took away three others. About how my dad\u2019s old wife was already skating on thin ice, her cries for help that went unanswered, how when she found out about what my mom and my dad were doing that what little was left beneath her shattered.\n\nAbout how they couldn\u2019t have known, but about the guilt she carried regardless \u2013 \u201clike a heavy backpack, mom?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sweetie. But I can never put it down.\u201d\n\nThat Lila was dead; and Isaac, too. That their mom had done *that* to them, and then did it to herself too. My dad found them in the basement when he got home from work. That he\u2019d never forgiven himself, and my mom never had either. That when they reappeared back in the basement like nothing had happened, even after their bodies were taken and buried all those years ago, they couldn\u2019t think of anything to do but to give them as normal of a life as possible.\n\nYet another difficult question: \u201cbut\u2026 why do they have to stay in the basement?\u201d\n\nI found out later that evening, when my dad came home from work and unlocked the door. Lila came out of the shadows, and I flinched instinctively as I saw her face for the first time, saw the gaping hole in her face where her left eye should have been. Isaac was little like Lila said, but the oozing wound to his jaw would have made it nearly impossible for him to speak if he had the chance to grow up.\n\nI was scared at first, but I put on my brave face and took Lila by the hand. I played with Lila and Isaac for the first time; shared my toys with them, laughed with them. I didn\u2019t meet their mom that day, but I would, years later. Once she and Lila and Isaac knew what became of them, she struggled to cope. She doesn\u2019t come out often, but I treat her with kindness when she does. The woman I know her as now couldn\u2019t imagine doing what she did.\n\nMy dad\u2019s second family still stayed inside, but they were no longer confined to the shadows of the basement after that day. They became less of my dad\u2019s *second* family as we all became one larger family that laughed and played and loved together.\n\nI don\u2019t live in that house anymore\u2026 I\u2019m an adult now, with an enormous appreciation for all of the freedom and opportunities available to me that I once took for granted. I know my family is far from normal \u2013 even horrible and horrifying in many ways that I helped to perpetuate as a kid \u2013 but it\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known. I love them\u2026 all of them.\n\nI still visit whenever I can, for birthdays and for Christmas and for summer vacations. And whenever I do visit, I take a moment to be grateful for the fact that when I knock on the front door, [Lila opens it](https://www.reddit.com/r/hercreation/).\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/thecrypticcompendium/)",

They showed up in the basement later as spirits, and he and his new wife (OP's mom) tried to give them as much as a normal life as they could but kept them in the basement as they still had bad wounds from their deaths. Hope that makes sense lol",

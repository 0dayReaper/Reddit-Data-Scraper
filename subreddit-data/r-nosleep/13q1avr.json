    "postText": "Have you ever heard of the red market?\n\nWhen I was a kid, I always thought the \u201cblack market\u201d was an actual, physical place. I pictured a dark, dimly lit bazaar straight out of Indiana Jones except exclusively dealing in drugs and slaves and what not instead of fruit. \n\nI guess a lot of kids probably thought of something like that, huh? Then you grow up and find out it\u2019s just sort of a nebulous term for any sort of illegal trade and it - I dunno, personally, it lost its luster!\n\nAnyway, flash forward a decade or two and I heard the term \u201cred market\u201d for the first time. It\u2019s another term for the organ trade, apparently - mostly illegal as well. The phrase fascinated me though. It evoked those childhood images of Agrabah-style bazaars all over again, except this time with ice boxes full of hearts and livers, canopic jars full of god-knows-what, eyeballs in glass vials - the works. All draped in crimson fabric, of course, befitting the name. \n\nBut it was all still just flights of childhood fancy. The real thing is, again, pretty banal, if a bit morbid. Transplant lists that outpace supply lead to underground organ trade, and the donees just try not to ask too many questions about the source. Sometimes whole-ass skeletons are bought and sold for research, or even as props for movies. Gross, but at least somewhat understandable. \n\nOne day, after class, I was wandering around my college campus waiting for my girlfriend to get off work to pick me up. Sometimes people posted signs for jobs, and Penny had been on my case lately about my unemployment, so I headed toward the park to see if there were any interesting postings. \n\nIf I\u2019m being totally honest, I wasn\u2019t really planning on applying. My courses were kicking my ass already, and unemployment paid enough for me to at least pay rent and afford some cheap food. I just wanted to look good for Pen by coming home with some leads. Scummy, I know. \n\nWell, there was a poster for a no-qualifications-needed assistant for some sort of experimental medical treatment, and something about it just called to me. It promised quick, easy cash for a small workload, with the caveat that you sign an NDA and be okay working around blood. I was already studying to become a nurse, so those stipulations didn\u2019t bug me one bit - and some easy money on the side wouldn\u2019t hurt either. Maybe I could actually afford to buy a new video game or two without rifling through Penny\u2019s purse. \n\nAt this point you\u2019re probably thinking I sound like a terrible person. Maybe you\u2019d even be right. But don\u2019t worry, karma\u2019s a bitch. \n\nAnyway, Pen picked me up and chewed me out, as usual. I tuned her out and played on my phone, nodding and muttering \u201cuh-huh\u201d as necessary to keep her from blowing up. It wasn\u2019t the healthiest relationship. But the sex was great, and I couldn\u2019t afford to live on my own, so why not?\n\nAnyway, not long after we got home I told her at one point that I had to make some calls to some potential employers. For once, I wasn\u2019t lying. I went into the other room and rang up the guy behind the medical experiment. \n\n\u201cSam here,\u201d he answered in a thick drawl. \u201cThis about the posting?\u201d\n\n\u201cErm, yes. My name\u2019s-\u201c\n\nHe cut me off. \u201cDon\u2019t care. Short staffed. You\u2019re hired. Meet me at 4th and Washington. I\u2019ll be wearing a red coat.\u201d\n\nHe hung up. Weird. \n\n\u201cHey, babe? Got an interview. I\u2019ll be back in a bit!\u201d I called through the door as I left. I didn\u2019t know if she heard me. Didn\u2019t really care, either. If she knew I was out she\u2019d probably have her boy toy Ricky over anyway.\n\nThankfully, the corner Sam mentioned wasn\u2019t too far away by foot, and the weather was nice enough for a brisk stroll. I was feeling pretty good, despite how weirdly abrupt the call went. Hell, I actually found myself whistling happily as I walked to 4th Street. I was optimistic. Maybe this could help me turn my life around. \n\nI approached the corner and saw a short man in a bright red trench coat with a matching wide-brimmed fedora. He looked for all the world like Danny Devito dressed up as Carmen Sandiego. \n\n\u201cYou Sam?\u201d I asked, as though there was any doubt. \n\nSam nodded and grunted to the affirmative. He then spun wordlessly and entered the dimly lit warehouse behind him, beckoning me to follow. Okay, that\u2019s a bit creepy, I\u2019ll admit - but again, I was in a pretty bad place mentally, so I didn\u2019t hesitate to follow him in. \n\nSam and I walked down a seemingly endless corridor lit by flickering fluorescent lights. The only sounds were the thuds of his heavy boots, the flapping of my flip flops, and the squeaks of the occasional mouse. \n\nAbout ten minutes passed. \n\n\u201cSo, uh\u2026 what kind of research-\u201c\n\nSam stopped in his tracks. He whirled around, glared so hard I swear his eyes glowed as red as his attire, and shushed me harshly. He turned back around and resumed his march as I meekly followed behind. \n\nStomp. Flop. Stomp. Flop. Stomp. Squeak. Flop. Over and over. It became a steady rhythm to the point that whenever we slowed to turn a corner or stepped in a puddle it was jarring to hear the pattern break. \n\nAfter a while, we arrived at a massive iron door locked with a comically large padlock. Sam withdrew an equally large key from his coat pocket, emblazoned with a skull and crossbones motif. He held it up to the flickering light and grinned. \n\n\u201cSkeleton key,\u201d he said, chuckling to himself briefly, clearly very proud of the awful pun.\n\nI laughed nervously in return, anticipating another death glare and demand for silence. Instead, he smiled warmly at me and unlocked the door, holding it open for me like an old timey gentleman. \n\n\u201cRight this way, honored guest,\u201d he said. \u201cApologies for the trek down here. We have to keep our operations hidden from prying eyes and ears, you know? Anyway, welcome aboard!\u201d\n\nI cautiously slipped past him and entered the room. In stark contrast to the dimly lit, dilapidated corridors that led here, the lab was bright, pristine, and colorful. Machines of all shapes and sizes hummed to life as Sam flicked a switch on. The one-time reception desk at the center had been repurposed as a makeshift workstation, covered in microscopes, racks of test tubes, and incubators. Tubes going down into the floor carried liquid to and from the largest machine. It shuddered periodically and ejected a canister into what looked like a tackle box angled to catch it. The box was nearly overflowing.\n\nI stared in wonder as the soft blue lights overhead illuminated this marvel of modern medical science. This was incredible. Despite my education, even I had no idea what some of these devices actually did! \n\nThe only thing missing was \u2026 workers. \n\n\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cI told you, we\u2019re very short staffed at the moment. So they spared me for a day to go out headhunting. Told me to just grab whoever I could. The ad wasn\u2019t lying. No experience necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 see,\u201d I answered hesitantly. I didn\u2019t really get it at all, to be honest. \u201cSo what do you guys do here? What do you need my help for?\u201d\n\nSam walked over to a coat rack and hung up the obnoxiously bright hat and jacket. \u201cWe just need warm bodies, really!\u201d he said with a laugh. I was getting tired of his bizarre sense of humor. I liked him better when he was silent. \n\n\u201cRight. Ha, ha. Seriously though, what do you need me to actually do?\u201d\n\n\u201cCourier service, for lack of a better word. Just need some of our products delivered, discreetly, no questions asked. We\u2019ll pay handsomely for your silent compliance.\u201d He collected the tackle box, closed the latch, and handed it to me, then replaced it with another empty one. \n\nI should clarify that these events took place well before the likes of DoorDash or Instacart were established. So while his request was a bit odd, it was that or, I dunno, FedEx, I guess. It made sense to me at the time. \n\nI should also clarify that by this point you\u2019re probably assuming he was going to have me deliver organs or something. Ahh, if only it was that simple. No, at this point, Sam really did have experimental medicine he was developing and needed a hand delivering it to \u201cpatients\u201d on the down-low. He was testing a few stem cell-derived treatments that couldn\u2019t get FDA approval because of some bureaucratic red tape bullshit, I guess. Some sort of anti-retrovirus injection, a \u201cmiracle foam\u201d first aid spray, that kind of thing. So I took tackle boxes full of syringes and spray cans to a few of his customers in exchange for cash and an oath to not speak a word to anyone. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m pretty bad at keeping my promises.\n\nA few weeks go by and I\u2019m enjoying having some disposable income for once. And even better, it\u2019s all cash, under the table, so I can keep my unemployment benefits! Life was good. Or at least, better than it had been for a long time. Penny and Ricky were still getting it on in \u201csecret\u201d whenever I was at class, but whatever. As long as she helped with the rent, she could screw half the football team for all I cared.\n\nAfter a few more months of this, Sam started opening up more. He was still unnervingly stoic and stern in the streets and the hallways leading to the lab, but once we were inside, he was a more and more of a goofball. His jokes still got on my nerves at times, but we were definitely warming up to each other\u2019s company. We started to actually talk about things beyond the deliveries.\n\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s not the best partner, but like - until I save up some more I can\u2019t live on my own, you know?\u201d\n\nI swear his eyes lit up when I said this. \n\n\u201cYou need more money to break free from the ol\u2019 ball and chain, huh? I\u2019ll see what I can do. Some of my clients have pretty deep pockets. The stuff we\u2019ve had you peddling? That\u2019s chump change.\u201d\n\nHis countenance returned to the deadly serious Sam that greeted me on the street corner. \n\n\u201cAssuming, of course, you can be a good boy and stay quiet,\u201d he practically growled at me. \n\nI nodded meekly. \u201cOf\u2026 of course, Sam. Ain\u2019t told a soul where I\u2019m getting the money, honest.\u201d \n\nSam paused and looked me up and down with a scowl. He sighed heavily, turned, and - I shit you not - pulled down on a candelabra-style light fixture on the wall, causing a dusty section of the masonry to rise into the ceiling.\n\nI stared, slack-jawed and confused. \u201cWhat in the Scooby Doo hell\u2026?\u201d\n\nAs the secret door opened, a series of identical sconces sprung to life beyond it, illuminating a damp-looking stone brick corridor. I half expected a swarm of bats to come fluttering out. \n\n\u201cThis is where we keep the premium shit,\u201d Sam answered. \u201cGotta keep away from \u2026 meddling kids,\u201d he finished with a wry smile. \n\nAs he led me down yet another seemingly endless corridor, one thing caught my attention - the smell. It smelled awful. It smelled like a middle school gym\u2019s locker room with just a hint of morgue. \n\nI noticed that Sam had pulled his neckerchief up around his nose and mouth. He saw me wince and handed me a small perfumed bandana of my own. \u201cStill time to turn back, kid. No shame if you don\u2019t have a strong enough stomach.\u201d\n\nI was committed. Any reasonable young man would\u2019ve taken him up on that offer - probably wouldn\u2019t have even made it this far, really - but I was dumb, broke, and miserable, so I held the cloth up to my face and pressed onward. It smelled vaguely of lilac. \n\nEventually, we made it to the end of the hallway. Sam knocked on the door rhythmically and it slowly creaked open. The smell intensified, even through the lilac. \n\nAs soon as he stepped over the threshold, a cacophony of screaming and banging erupted from somewhere below us. I cautiously followed, noting that we were standing on a narrow walkway over a dark pit. \u201cDon\u2019t look down,\u201d he advised as he led me across the scaffolding toward what appeared to be a makeshift freight elevator with no walls or railings. \n\nI tripped over a loose power cable at one point and nearly went over the edge. With Sam\u2019s help I steadied myself, but dropped the bandana. The smell was overbearing. Sweat, feces, blood, decay - what the hell was going on down there? \n\nThe wailing and banging continued, and intensified as the bandana fluttered down into the darkness below. Then I heard a loud snap, a yelp, and everything went silent. \n\nSam and I boarded the elevator. I was shaking, terrified of what lay below us. To my relief, the elevator ascended instead, carrying us away from whatever produced the nightmarish scents and sounds. \n\n\u201cStill with me? We\u2019re almost there. Sorry about the mess back there. Necessary evil.\u201d\n\nI nodded and tried to keep a brave face. \u201cWh\u2026 what-\u201c I barely squeaked out before my throat became too dry to speak. \n\nSam shook his head. \u201cBest if you don\u2019t know the details. Just do the delivery, get paid, and forget about this until we call you back in.\u201d\n\nThe elevator stopped in front of a wall of lockers. Sam opened one and produced a small icebox and handed it to me. \u201cRemember. Don\u2019t open it. Don\u2019t ask questions. You\u2019ll be safe, and the money will keep flowing. Get nosy, and I can\u2019t promise my associates won\u2019t take drastic action. And that\u2019d be a shame. I like you.\u201d\n\nI grasped the handle. It wasn\u2019t as heavy as I expected, but something inside it sloshed when I shifted its weight. \n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he said, with an uncharacteristic air of actual, honest to goodness emotion in his voice. \u201cPlease don\u2019t open it. I\u2019m serious. I don\u2019t want to have to replace you.\u201d\n\nFor once, I listened. I obeyed his creepy instructions and delivered the cooler to the address he gave me, pocketed the money, and went home. Requests to deliver vaccines dried up at this point. My best guess is that he found someone else to do the lower-risk gigs now that I was handling the coolers. He called every now and then for another cooler delivery, and gradually I built up enough savings that I would be able to kick out Penny. \n\nWell, that\u2019s what I thought, anyway. When I got home one day, the place was a mess, and she never showed up after work. Ricky stopped by a few times under hilariously false pretenses, clearly worried about her but trying not to expose their trysts. Apparently, he thought I was an idiot. \n\nI didn\u2019t know where she went. I didn\u2019t really care, though. It saved me the trouble of breaking up with her and evicting her. \n\nThe next time Sam called, he walked me halfway across the pit before stopping. He chuckled to himself once more. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, by the way.\u201d\n\nMy blood ran cold. Did he hurt Penny? Our relationship was a fucked up, toxic mess, but that didn\u2019t mean I wanted her dead or anything!\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I played dumb. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. She\u2019s alive,\u201d he said. Well, that\u2019s creepy. \n\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cBest if you don\u2019t know the details,\u201d he repeated. \u201cDon\u2019t get nosy. Don\u2019t want to have to replace you.\u201d \n\nI placed a hand on his shoulder. \n\n\u201cSam. What. Did. You. Do.\u201d\n\nMy grip tightened. He squirmed in pain. \n\n\u201cBest\u2026 if you don\u2019t \u2026 ow, let me -\u201c\n\nI wasn\u2019t taking any more of his shit. \u201cEnough cryptic bull, man. We\u2019ve been working together for a year. You owe me at least a little honesty. What did you do to my girlfriend?!\u201d\n\nHe struggled out of my grasp and right into the power cable that nearly cost me my own life a few months ago. He tripped too. It\u2019s like it happened in slow motion. I couldn\u2019t stop him. I reached out but - it\u2019s like when you\u2019re in a dream, you know? You try to run or punch and it\u2019s like you\u2019re underwater? I reached out for Sam but he fell off the scaffolding faster than my arms could reach him. I felt his red coat slip right between my fingers as he vanished into the abyss below. To his credit, he didn\u2019t scream or beg or anything. He just spat one final \u201cah, fuck\u201d under his breath and fell. \n\nIf he said anything else, it was drowned out by the shrieking and banging below. That did it. My curiosity was at its breaking point. I switched my phone\u2019s flashlight on and aimed it down. \n\nTo my horror, as I panned the beam of light across the blood-soaked floor, I saw that it was lined with cages. Each cage had one or two naked humanoids in it, battered and bloody, hooked up to an IV. Some laid still, sobbing. Some pounded their fists against the bars until they bled. Men in hazmat suits with knives milled between the cages, loading pounds of flesh and organs into the very same coolers I\u2019d been dutifully delivering on behalf of the man in red. If they noticed my presence, they didn\u2019t react. That made it even eerier. They just waddled from \u201cpatient\u201d to \u201cpatient,\u201d collecting flesh and offal for distribution. \n\nTo my horror, I watched as they unholstered a can of Sam\u2019s miracle foam and sprayed I on the wounds. I never believed his claims before, but it looked like it was regrowing some of the tissue, slowly but surely. After some time, a worker would come along with a rag, wipe off the foam, and harvest from the same place as their predecessor. One poor soul had at least three eyes removed from his head before they moved on. He never stopped howling in pain until they took his tongue, too. They didn\u2019t spray the foam on that. \n\nI did my best not to scream, vomit, or drop my phone, but as the beam of light reached the far eastern corner of the warehouse, I couldn\u2019t hold it in any more. \n\nLooking back up at me from a cage was Penny. She was battered, bruised, head shaved, multiple IVs and straps holding her in place. Barely recognizable. But I\u2019d know those eyes anywhere. The eyes that originally attracted me to her before our relationship went to shit. Our gazes met. She tried to call out to me, but her tongue had apparently already been excised and loaded into a box. A worker approached with a can of the miracle foam. \n\nI began to sob. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I mouthed. I hope she could tell what I said. But I didn\u2019t stick around or mount a rescue effort or anything. I\u2019m a coward and an all around horrible person, remember?\n\nI heard a loud, sickening thud. No doubt that was Sam hitting the ground. Indistinct yells and commands from the workers could be heard between the inmates\u2019 racket. Shit. Red lights flashed along the walkway. An alarm sounded in the distance. \n\nThat settled it. No time for heroics.\n\nI ran like hell, sealing the facility behind me. No idea if anyone but Sam had a key to that first door. I bolted home as fast as I could. Man, I\u2019ve never been so grateful to have been paid in all cash. I gathered my essentials and left my apartment behind. I ghosted my school and found a cheap trailer park to crash at on the other side of town.\n\nShould I have gone to the police? Probably. But I was an accomplice to god-knows-what for nearly a year. As much as I feared Sam\u2019s employers tracking me down, I feared going to prison just as much. So instead, I decided to write an anonymized account up and share it to the internet in the hopes that some enterprising officer or civilian happens upon it and does what I couldn\u2019t. \n\nBecause for the better part of the year, I was an unwitting salesman of the red market. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, Penny. Even you didn\u2019t deserve \u2026 that.",

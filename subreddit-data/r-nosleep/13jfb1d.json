    "postText": "It\u2019s located at the \u2018Winchester Mystery House\u2019 in San Jose, CA. I\u2019ve only ever been there once, maybe about five or six years ago. I used to live in California when I was going to college. One day, my friend from an online video-game was in town. She ended up randomly meeting up with me. Weird, I know. Well, not that weird these days. What is weird though, is what ended up happening to her when we arrived\u2026\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of the \u2018Winchester Mystery House\u2019, it\u2019s as simple as this: a woman bought a country estate in 1886, after her closest family members died, and, legend has it, she couldn\u2019t stop building for fear she would die too.\n\nThat\u2019s right. She built a bunch of wacky rooms, supposedly to confuse the spirits so they wouldn\u2019t be able to find her, and of course, the whole town mocked her for her irrational fears. Anyways, I haven\u2019t been able to find a single post about this happening to anyone else. I need to find out any information I can about the \u201cDoor to Nowhere\u201d.\n\nIt was a hot, sunny day in Seaside, CA. I was on my way to work. I hated my job. I was a barista at a boujie cafe in Carmel Valley. Traffic was bad and I was at a stop light for what felt like 5 minutes when I got a call from a random number. I almost didn\u2019t pick up, but decided, F it.\n\nclick \u201cHello?\u201d A bubbly voice picked up, \u201cHey, dude. Sorry, I got a new phone!\u201d It was my friend, Kriz. The online friend I was talking about. She went on, \u201cSo I was driving and just passed a sign that said \u2018Welcome to Seaside\u2019. Aren\u2019t you from Seaside?!\u201d\n\nBoom. That was it. That\u2019s all I needed to hear. I had been looking for a reason to quit my job all week. Plus there was no way I was going to miss out on possibly the only real opportunity to see my free-spirited friend from MapleStory. She was like my older sister growing up. She texted me a couple of weeks ago saying she was going on a road trip and might be passing through soon. It wasn\u2019t for sure, but I had a good feeling.\n\n\u201cOh my gosh! I\u2019m in.\u201d I said. \u201cYes! Where you at? I\u2019ll come scoop you.\u201d She sounded so stoked. \u201cGive me like 10 minutes. I\u2019m on my way back. I\u2019ll send you the addy.\u201d I didn\u2019t tell her about my job. It just wasn\u2019t a good time. I couldn\u2019t ruin today with sour news, so I pulled a U-ey and headed back home.\n\nWhen I got there, she was already waiting for me. I looked down at my outfit and realized I was still wearing my name tag. I quickly ripped it off and hid it in my center console, then I looked up and smiled with a casual wave. (Super inconspicuous.)\n\nWe hugged and she told me to jump in. \u201cWe\u2019re going on an adventure, but it\u2019s a secret.\u201d She said, \u201cTo San Jose!\u201d \u201cAye, aye, Captain!\u201d I saluted her and we took off. We were both pretty elated just to be with each other in person for the first time so, in turn, we talked a lot about life and our future plans.\n\nWhen we were about 5 minutes away, she finally started sharing about where the heck we were even going. After getting into the details, she finally got to the juice.\n\n\u201c\u2018The Winchester Mystery House\u2019 was bought by a Ms. Sarah Winchester on this very day 137 years ago, and legend has it, Sarah will open the gate to all who pass on this sacred day.\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, ma\u2019am, this is a Chili\u2019s.\u201d I snarked.\n\n\u201cSeriously! I HAVE to see this place for myself. Even if it doesn\u2019t open, we\u2019re finding a way to sneak in even if it kills me!\u201d She stuck her finger in the air, assertively.\n\nI looked at her, puzzled. \u201cWhat? Sne\u2026 sneaking in?\u201d I was shook.\n\n\u201cWe HAVE TO! You don\u2019t understand. This is the only day every year they aren\u2019t open.\u201d She said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that suspish?!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what if they\u2019re in there celebrating with the staff or something? Don\u2019t they give tours there?\u201d I was concerned.\n\n\u201cRelax! If we see any cars, we\u2019ll leave. Oh, look, speak of the devil, we\u2019re here!\u201d We pulled into a fancy gated driveway with a beautiful, scenic property.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s closed. Would you look at that?\u201d I was uneasy. I wished she would\u2019ve told me all of this like 5 minutes into the drive, not 5 minutes out from our destination.\n\nShe got out and asked, mockingly, \u201cDo we have to say the magic words?\u201d\n\nI laughed, \u201cGet in. This is ridiculous!\u201d \u201cOpen sesame!\u201d She laughed. And just like that, the gate opened, no hesitation, like something heard her words.\n\nWe stared at each other for a second, while the doors slowly creaked open. It was kind of unsettling actually. Like we both knew something was off.\n\n\u201cShit.\u201d She whispered as she jumped back in the driver\u2019s seat and grabbed the clutch. She eased in through the gate.\n\nWe drove for about 30 seconds until we reached the front entrance. This place looked and felt disarming. It was like there was someone watching us. Or something.\n\n\u201cWhat if they have cameras?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cOh, shush. The gate opened. We\u2019re just here for a tour.\u201d She smirked.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you dragged me into this.\u201d I mumbled as we climbed out of the car.\n\n\u201cRelax. We\u2019re young and dumb. It\u2019s fine.\u201d She reassured me.\n\nWe both walked up to the front door together and found it was locked. I looked at her again, uncertainly.\n\n\u201cYou check that door,\u201d She pointed at a nearby entryway. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll check the one by the garden over there!\u201d She pointed.\n\nI nodded and marched over to the left entrance. This place was pretty big, so it took me about a minute to get to the other door. I looked behind me and Kriz was still on her way to the garden as well, but it looked as if some faint light was following her. I can\u2019t really describe it as anything else. It was like an orb.\n\nJust then it started raining. It felt like a funeral day. I got this overwhelming feeling that something was wrong, but I kept on, knowing very well I was probably just causing myself man-made anxiety.\n\nI finally got to the door. It was locked. I shrugged and turned to walk away, but just then, it inched open. I thought maybe I just hadn\u2019t turned it hard enough the first time. I called out to Kriz 3 or 4 times, but she didn\u2019t answer, so I decided to try to run around the inside of the courtyard to unlock the door from the other side of the garden and let her in. It was such a long walk to go get her and then come all the way back around, so I just thought, why not.\n\nI entered the courtyard and it was absolutely gorgeous. There was a garden with fresh flowers and the property was massive. I wondered how many rooms had been built here.\n\nI raced to the other side of the property by the garden and didn\u2019t see Kriz. I assumed she tried walking back to the car, so I unlocked the door and peaked out, but I didn\u2019t see her.\n\nI started getting worried, so I turned around to see if she had come in through my door, but no luck. I thought back to that orb. What was that?\n\nJust then, I heard a loud scream. Standing in the middle of the courtyard, I whipped my head towards the unpleasant screech. There was a door with no floor in front of it leading out from the second floor. It was called, \u201cThe Door to Nowhere\u201d.\n\n\u201cKriz!\u201d I screamed. \u201cHow did you get up there??\u201d\n\nShe responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\nJust then, something started taking over her body. It started pushing her forward.\n\n\u201cHelp me! Oh my god! Help me!\u201d She begged as she held the doorframe with both her hands.\n\nBut it was no use. The \u201cforce\u201d threw her body down off the balcony. It didn\u2019t throw her down flat though. It literally flipped her body upside down. When she landed, a loud crack echoed through the courtyard.\n\nI screamed. Panicking, I ran to her body, absolutely shaking. Slipping in the mud, I fell right in front of her. I flipped her face up. Her eyes were rolled back in her head and she was not breathing. I looked around me, afraid of what might happen next. Just then, her head rolled back almost completely and she muttered, \u201cGet out.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t. Her. Voice.\n\nI screamed, picking myself up out of the mud, and sprinting towards the door I initially came in. I whipped it open and ran through. The car was still parked where we left it, so I booked it to the driver\u2019s side and hopped in. I went to start the car and it was just then that I realized, she had the keys.\n\nBOOM, BOOM, BOOM There was a knock at my window. It was her. She was alive and looked completely normal. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nNaturally, I screamed.\n\n\u201cYou trying to leave without me?\u201d She asked through the glass.\n\nI screamed again.\n\nShe opened the door as I peeled backwards into the other seat.\n\n\u201cHey, relax. Is everything okay? You look like you\u2019ve just seen a ghost.\u201d She laughed. \u201cDid you find a way in?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?! How are you still alive?!\u201d I stammered.\n\n\u201cAlive? Dude, we just went to the other gate, came back, and you sat down in my seat. Are you okay?\u201d She looked concerned.\n\nI pulled myself together and wondered if I may have cooked that whole situation up in my head. No, it was too real. There\u2019s no way.\n\n\u201cGet in! Hurry. We have to go.\u201d I rushed.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright, already. I\u2019m coming.\u201d She slid into the car and we turned around to leave. She turned the radio on. \u201cLet\u2019s just listen to some music and calm down, shall we?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that sounds good, I just\u2026\u201d I replied, but was interrupted by the radio going static and a bunch of white noise coming through.\n\n\u201cThe gate!\u201d I yelled. It was closing and we still had a good 500 feet to go before we could make it through.\n\nShe panicked and stepped down on the pedal as hard as she could. The car jolted a bit and then our bodies stuck to the backs of our chairs as we started flooring it. The static started getting louder and a voice came through, \u201cLeave\u2026 Get out\u2026\u201d The gate was almost completely closed now.\n\n\u201cWhat do I do?!\u201d She started slowing down.\n\n\u201cOPEN SESAME.\u201d I yelled as I reached over and pushed my foot down on hers over the gas pedal.\n\nWe broke through the gate, knocking her right mirror off and puncturing a headlight, but we didn\u2019t care. We kept going, speeding away as fast as we could. It was weird too. The rain stopped immediately upon leaving the property, almost like it was only raining there.\n\nWe never went back to the \u2018Winchester Mystery House\u2019 ever again or spoke about this with anyone. Kriz has never been the same since. Her close family members have been dying off over the last few years. She reached out about it a week after we had met up. Her grandmother who was in good health passed suddenly and then her best friend was in a fatal car accident a couple of days later.\n\nSince then, she has lost both of her parents and most of her close friends. Kriz has been bed-ridden and terrified for the last few years. She fears she may curse yet another victim just by the grace of her sheer presence.\n\nI researched the \u201cDoor to Nowhere\u201d and I guess an earthquake had destroyed the room that was once there in 1906. Does anyone know where this door was trying to lead to? I have to help my friend.",

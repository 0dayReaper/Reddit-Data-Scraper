    "postText": "I have this recurring nightmare. I attend this school where odd things happen. In this school, there are people I\u2019ve never met before. Classes I\u2019ve never taken.\n\nEvery time I have this dream, I enter a classroom that is listed on my class schedule, and the teacher yells at me for not showing up for weeks or even months. The teacher embarrasses me in front of the class and makes me do work that I didn\u2019t even study for.  \r  \n\r  \nI guess it\u2019s not the SCARIEST thing someone can dream about, but being forced to do a mountain of missed classwork is horrible. It also feels embarrassing being humiliated in front of this made-up class. It always feels too real. \r  \n\r  \nI also get variations of this nightmare. Sometimes I dream that I\u2019m running through the halls of the school trying to find where a class is. Then, by the time I find the classroom with the right room number, it\u2019s too late, class is over. Detention. \r  \n\r  \nI\u2019ve had these types of dreams so many times that it feels like I\u2019m enrolled in a completely different school in my mind when I\u2019m asleep. I even have a mental image of what the school looks like from the outside after all those times I\u2019ve been in recess or in the parking lot in other dreams. \r  \n\r  \nSometimes it\u2019s a class with a teacher from an earlier dream, other times it\u2019s completely different. \r  \n\r  \nI figured these dreams were based on past experiences from elementary, middle, and high school that manifest themselves into vivid simulations from the back of my mind. But then three days ago I found out that it was a lot more than that. \r  \n\r  \n \r  \n\r  \nMy friend Santiago and I ride motorcycles together when the weather is nice. For weeks we were planning on going to this huge motorcycle meetup together. Before the meetup started, we wanted to rendezvous at his house and then ride our motorcycles to the spot together. \r  \n\r  \nI rode my motorcycle from my house to his using my GPS. I\u2019ve never been to his house before. He lived about thirty-five minutes away from me in a town I\u2019ve passed by but never visited. As soon as I got to his house, Santiago was already turning on his motorcycle in front of his garage. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cHey man, how\u2019ve you been?\u201d I spoke. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cGood, and you?\u201d he replied. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cGreat. I love this weather. You ready to go?\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cHold on, let me put my dogs inside\u201d.  \r  \n\r  \n \r  \n\r  \nOnce we were all set to go, Santiago rode his motorcycle in front of me as I followed. He knew his way around to get us out of the neighborhood and back on the main road.  \r  \n\r  \nNow here\u2019s where things get weird. Between the cluster of suburban neighborhood houses there was a long building that broke the pattern. I saw it in the distance as Santiago and I rode closer. The building was sitting on a hill and just looked unnatural in its place. \r  \n\r  \nAs we got past each stop sign and rode closer, the building strangely kept looking more and more familiar. I kept my bike going at a decent speed of 20 miles per hour. I intended to look at this building closely and drove slowly \r  \n\r  \nThen, Santiago and I passed by the front of the building. I constantly turned my head to look at it, then to the road so I didn\u2019t fall or crash. But once we were right in front of it, I just stared. I realized it when I saw the main doors. \r  \n\r  \nIt was... just like in my dreams. A long one-story building sitting on top of a grassy green hill. The same distinct main entrance doors. A red and yellow playground on the side of the building. A medium sized parking lot. \r  \n\r  \nThere was something so liminal about this building. Almost like those liminal spaces pictures that you see everywhere online. The building did not look real, but it was there right in front of me.  \r  \n\r  \nOnce I turned my head back to the road, we reached the next stop sign and I nearly bumped tires with Santiago\u2019s bike. Then, eventually, Santiago and I got farther, and farther away. \r  \n\r  \nThe rest of the day went well. We went to the meetup, saw a bunch of cool motorcycles, ate at a restaurant in the area, then parted ways and headed home. I had almost forgotten about the building until I rode home on my motorcycle and had time to think about it. \r  \n\r  \nI thought, \u201cWhat was that place? A school? Why did it look almost the exact same as that school that I see in my dreams? Have I been there before? No, that can\u2019t be. I\u2019ve never visited such a specific neighborhood before. There\u2019s no way I\u2019ve seen this building in my life. It\u2019s just not possible for this dream school to be real.  \r  \n\r  \nLast night, I dreamed of the school again. It started off with me looking at the time. It was noon and I was just arriving to school. I was walking towards the entrance in a hurry. I entered the building, and the students were walking in the halls as usual.  \r  \n\r  \nI checked my schedule to see where I had to go next. In the list of unintelligible writing, I somehow deduced that I had to go to pottery class. I walked in an aimless direction until I reached a small classroom.  \r  \n\r  \nAn old man with white hair and glasses looked at me angrily as I took my seat. I always hated old grumpy teachers. This guy was no different \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWHERE have YOU been. What, you don\u2019t think this class is IMPORTANT? You haven\u2019t even started on the first project and we\u2019re already on PROJECT FOUR.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nAs always, I just sit there, confused and ashamed. The entire class giggling or shaking their heads in disappointment. The teacher gave me the angriest face as his right hand shook while holding a small pot. Right before the dream ended, I saw the pot leave his hand and soar in my direction. \r  \n\r  \nI woke up not knowing if I was still dreaming or not. Dazed, I had to remind myself that it was only a dream. That dream was extremely vivid. Moreso than the others because the school felt all too real. It was like I was there. The similarities between the dream school and the real building I saw were uncanny. Something made me want to investigate it further. \r  \n\r  \n \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r  \n\r  \nI had Google Maps pulled up on my phone. I was looking at Santiago\u2019s address while lying in bed. I knew the building should be around his house, maybe about five or six blocks away. Since the meetup spot was more east, I tapped and dragged the map to the right slowly. \r  \n\r  \nIt took only seconds until I found the long building. In this top-down view, I saw how it broke the pattern from the rest of the houses. I tapped it to see if I could get more info on it. Strangely, Google Maps did not have this building listed as anything. It just showed the address as if it were another house. \r  \n\r  \nThen I went into street view mode to get a look at it from street level. \u201cOh god...\u201d I thought to myself. It looked the exact same as the school I visited in my dreams. This can\u2019t be a coincidence. I must see it for myself. \r  \n\r  \n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r  \n\r  \nUPDATE \r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s been a week and one day since I passed the building on my bike. It was Monday now. Curiosity got the better of me as I was interested in seeing the interior of the building. \r  \n\r  \n \r  \n\r  \nThe morning was breezy and chilly with cloudy skies. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was doing. I was driving in my car to a school I saw in my dreams. It didn\u2019t take too long to arrive since there was less traffic in the morning. It was almost 8 AM when I arrived at the parking lot of the school and there were a couple of other cars parked there. \u201cLast time it was empty. There should be people inside\u201d I thought. \r  \n\r  \nAt first, my plan was that I wasn\u2019t going to enter. I was just going to look through the windows on the doors. Just to see what the inside looked like. This place seemed like a school for small children that I had no business entering. \r  \n\r  \nI walked to the entrance with the glass doors. Honestly, I felt like a creep, but I really wanted to look inside, while hoping there wasn\u2019t a cop around being suspicious of me. \r  \n\r  \nI put my forehead on the glass of the door, with my hands covering the sides of my face to see better. As soon as I got close enough to the glass, I saw nothing but heard everything. With my eyes, I saw an empty hall. With my ears, I heard hundreds of voices.  \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWait... where are these noises coming from?\u201d I thought as I kept looking around. These sounds were so audible that it sounded like people were on the other side of the door. Yet, I didn\u2019t see anyone. Just a long hallway with the lights off. There were doors on the sides. All closed. There was even debris on the floor. The place looked ruined and abandoned. Yet, the sound of walking, shuffling, talking, and shouting were still audible. \r  \n\r  \nIt was all so spooky. I felt like my mind was playing tricks on me. Something inside me begged me to open the doors and walk around. Was that the right thing to do? This was all unnerving and mysterious and I felt like I had to go inside. At least to just walk a couple of feet. \r  \n\r  \nAgain, I looked around behind me to see if anyone was looking. While my head was turned toward the outside, I slowly opened the doors and entered when there was enough space to get in. As soon as I was in, I turned my head forward again and I did not expect to see what was in front of me. \r  \n\r  \nLike magic, the once empty hall was now sprawling with people. Hundreds of them appeared seemingly out of thin air. The lights were on, the floor was clean, and people were going in and out of classrooms. I couldn\u2019t tell what age they were. They all looked somewhere between middle and high school. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat the fuck. Where am I?\u201d I whispered. I looked down at my hands to make sure this wasn\u2019t one of those dreams. I opened and closed my fists. I pinched myself and it hurt. Sure enough, it was real life. \r  \n\r  \nI stood in that same spot for about a minute just watching everyone walk. When that minute was up, I realized there were less and less people out in the hallway. I saw the last few hurrying to where they needed to be as the last classroom door closed. \r  \n\r  \nIn just a few moments, I was alone in the hallway with the buzz of the fluorescent lights. The walls were half white at the bottom, and half red at the top. It looked so liminal like the hallways in my dreams. This wasn\u2019t a dream, though. \r  \n\r  \nI began walking down the hall. I passed by classrooms that had small square windows on the doors that I couldn\u2019t see through. \r  \n\r  \n It was almost silent now with no noise besides my footsteps. I checked my phone for the time. It was 8:15AM. I noticed I didn\u2019t have signal at all. \u201cWhat? ...why don\u2019t I have service?\u201d I thought to myself.  \r  \n\r  \nOnce I got to the end of the hallway, I saw that it split into two other hallways. I looked deep into each hallway and they both looked the same. Not knowing where to go I thought, \u201cOkay. That\u2019s enough. Time to leave.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nI did a 180 degree turn to go back the way I came. I didn\u2019t even take a third step when I heard a door open intensely and a harsh voice say \u201coh THERE he is. OUT in the HALLS and not in CLASS. HEY. YOUNG MAN. You better get in this classroom RIGHT NOW.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nI was startled by that voice. It broke the silence so abruptly that I jumped. It was a fat old lady with a wrinkled and scrunched face. She had curly gray hair and glasses. \r  \n\r  \nI just stared at her for a moment. Then I tried to speak, \u201c... I- I'm sorry, I\u2019m uh... not-\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cYOU HAVEN\u2019T SHOWED UP TO A SINGLE CLASS. Do you have ANY idea how much TROUBLE YOU\u2019RE IN?\u201d she boomed. \r  \n\r  \nI sounded like a mouse compared to her. \u201cL-look I... I think you uh... got the wrong per-\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cGET IN HERE.\u201d she grew angrier. \u201cGET IN THIS CLASSROOM RIGHT NOW.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nI stopped my little muttering and began to walk backwards. The lady then vigorously swung open the classroom door so hard it hit the wall as she speed-walked in my direction with such an aggravated look on her face. \r  \n\r  \nNow, I\u2019m not short, but I\u2019m also not tall. I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d.  But compared to this lady, she made me look like a third grader. She was gigantic. Probably more than 7 feet tall. \r  \n\r  \nI didn\u2019t know what she was going to do. I walked backwards first and then tried turning around. Before I could make a complete turn, I felt a strong grip on my wrist and my motion stopped completely. I looked down at my wrist and saw a fat hand around it. I struggled hard to break free from the grasp, but I was swiftly pulled in the old lady\u2019s direction. \r  \n\r  \nNo matter how much I struggled, I couldn\u2019t break away. The old lady was dragging me toward the classroom. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWHAT... THE HELL. HEY. ERGHHH LET GO OF ME!\u201d I yelled. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cYOU DAMN TROUBLESOME KID. GO TO YOUR SEAT!\u201d She pulled me up into the air, suspended by my shirt, and threw me into the classroom. \r  \n\r  \nI hit the floor with a hard thud. My elbow and knees took the most impact as I was slow to get up. Pain hit my legs hard as I got back on my two feet and heard the door shut firmly. \r  \n\r  \nThe old lady that just got done manhandling me took a heavy sigh and said, \u201cOKAY. Now we have a full class. That makes Miss Howler happy.\u201d She took a seat at the big desk in the front. After sitting down, she looked over at me with an angry and confused expression. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhy are you still standing there? Get to YOUR SEAT.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nI was frozen but my eyes darted around the room. I looked at the students. The class was indeed full. I looked at their faces and they were all grinning and looking straight. \r  \n\r  \nMy observation of the class was interrupted by the loud slam of Miss Howler\u2019s fat fist on her desk. \r  \n\r  \n**\u201cI SAID GO TO YOUR SEAT. RIGHT NOW!!!\u201d** she yelled. \r  \n\r  \nI didn\u2019t know what to do. Should I make a run for it? Or should I just sit like the teacher said and just get it over with? I didn\u2019t want to risk being thrown again so I went to the back of the classroom where I saw an empty seat. I sat down and still couldn\u2019t believe what was going on. This felt like a nightmare I couldn\u2019t wake up from. \r  \n\r  \nI looked around me. Everyone was still looking straight forward. Miss Howler was sitting at her desk again sorting some papers.  \r  \n\r  \n\u201cHow did I get myself into this mess? And how long will this all take?\u201d I thought. Then, Miss Howler got up from her desk and walked over to the first student sitting in the front row. From where I was, I could see she was passing a packet of papers to each student. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cOKAY. Take one and pass it backwards, please. What you will all receive momentarily is our next assignment. Read through it carefully\u201d she said. \r  \n\r  \nThe student sitting in front of me passed a packet over his shoulder for me to grab. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cSurely, I won\u2019t be needing this\u201d I thought while placing it on my desk. I read the words at the top. \r  \n\r  \n*ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 101 \u2013 ASSIGNMENT 8* \r  \n\r  \nThe title was the only thing I understood. The rest of the page was just a bunch of science jargon. The questions were all based on equations with more letters than numbers.  \r  \n\r  \n\u201cLike always, have this completed by the end of the week. Late work WILL NOT give you full credit... OHHH... SPEAKING of LATE WORK\u201d Howler turned around and grabbed something beneath her desk. When she turned back around, she looked at me over the top of her glasses. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cYOU. Young man. Come here. Now.\u201d Howler pointed at me and wriggled her finger, motioning for me to come up to the front of the class. \r  \n\r  \nNervously, I got up and walked past the many students that were still smiling and looking forward. I don\u2019t think I ever saw them blink. When I got to Howler\u2019s desk, she had a neat stack of papers probably about a foot high.  \r  \n\r  \n\u201cTake your work and SIT down,\u201d said Howler while glaring at me. Before anything else I grabbed the packet on the top of the stack. I looked at the top, ORGANIC CHEMISTRY LESSONS 1-127. I quickly turned around and walked back towards my seat before Howler slammed her fist again. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWHERE ARE YOU GOING?\u201d \r  \n\r  \nI turned around slowly and nervously. \u201cWh- what?\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWHY DID YOU ONLY TAKE THE ONE? YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY?!? \r  \n\r  \n\u201cUmm... no. Look, I\u2019m not supposed to be here\u201d I said. \u201cHow DARE YOU. COME TAKE THE REST OF YOUR WORK,\u201d she yelled.  \u201cI... okay,\u201d I said as I walked back. I didn\u2019t know that the whole stack was for me. As I reached for the stack, my vision went all white. \r  \n\r  \n*KABWOOSH* \r  \n\r  \nIn an instant, white papers flew everywhere around me like a hurricane. Howler had bashed the stack with the back of her fat hand so hard that none of them were on the desk anymore. As the last page hit the floor she said, \u201cYou have SOME NERVE trying to joke around with ME. YOU\u2019VE GOT SOME NERVE. Now PICK IT UP\u201d. \r  \n\r  \nI thought, \u201cthere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to pick all of this up. This is ridiculous. I must leave. I can make a run for it from here\u201d. \r  \n\r  \nBefore picking up a single page, I rushed to the door, pulled on the knob violently and turned it both ways. Sadly, it wouldn\u2019t give. It was locked from the inside. Once I realized this, I felt something towering over me from behind. A shadow loomed over the door. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhere do you think YOU\u2019RE GOING? I cannot BELIEVE THIS. IN ALL MY YEARS YOU ARE THE WORST\u201d. \r  \n\r  \nI was still facing the door. Disappointed that I couldn\u2019t leave. Suddenly, my neck tightened, and I felt like I was choking. I was pulled backwards. My shirt's collar fell tight as I realized I was being pulled by the back of my collar. \r  \n\r  \nThen I was airborne and fell onto the bed of papers on the floor. \r  \n\r  \n**\u201cI SAID PICK THEM UP. I WON\u2019T ASK YOU AGAIN. DO IT NOW!!!!!!\u201d** Howler was the angriest she\u2019d ever been so far. \r  \n\r  \nI had no other choice but to pick them up and put them back in a stack. As I was placing them in a pile, I saw bright red dot appear on the white of a page. \u201cBlood?\u201d I thought. Then a few seconds later another drop. I placed my hand on my cheek, and it stung. My fingers were red from touching it. When Howler bashed the paper stack, I must have gotten a paper cut. \r  \n\r  \nOnce I was done stacking, I lifted it up and went to my seat. Then Howler began teaching. I can\u2019t remember a single word she said while teaching. It was all chemistry, and I didn\u2019t know a thing about it. All I knew was that I had to get out of there. I needed a reason. \r  \n\r  \nBut then she said, \u201cAlright. Any questions?\u201d \r  \n\r  \nI shot my hand up before any of the five other students could. As soon as I did, Howler looked at me and said, \u201cYes, YOU.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cUh... may I use the bathroo-\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cNO. PAY ATTENTION.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cPlease. I just need some paper for this cut on my face.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nShe glared at me so hard. I was starting to regret even asking. It felt like I made a huge mistake for even raising my hand at all. \r  \n\r  \nTo my surprise she said, \u201cFINE. But don\u2019t think for a SECOND that I\u2019m just going to let you WALK OUT OF HERE by yourself. I\u2019m NOT stupid.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nShe looked at the student right in front of her. \u201cJames. Please escort your fellow student to the restroom.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nI immediately got up and walked towards the front. James stood up and turned to me. He had short blond hair, green eyes, and was still smiling even when looking at me. \u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d He said in a proud voice. James walked in front of me. \r  \n\r  \n Before we got to the door, I froze as we heard, \u201cLISTEN. You BETTER be back here in TWO MINUTES. BOTH OF YOU. DO NOT waste my time. GO.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nWith that, James turned the doorknob. Surprisingly, it opened. How did it open so easily for him? \r  \n\r  \nJames and I exited the classroom. Just being out of it felt like freedom. My cut was still dripping blood. I then spoke, \u201cHey James. What is this place? What\u2019s going on?\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cThis is our school. Where have you been this whole time?\u201d He replied. He would not stop smiling. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ve never been inside this school before.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nHe said, \u201cYes you have.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n \r  \n\r  \nWhen we got to the bathroom, I quickly got some paper towels and placed them on my cheek. James then said, \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go back now\u201d as he turned around and headed for the door. \r  \n\r  \nMy stomach ached at the thought of going back into that classroom. I was already through with being there. \u201cHey James, you go on ahead I\u2019ll be in the classroom soon,\u201d I said while opening a stall door. \r  \n\r  \nJames stopped before opening the door. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should keep Miss Howler waiting any longer,\u201d \r  \n\r  \nI entered the stall and said, \u201cI really, really, have to use the toilet pretty badly. It\u2019s going to take a while. Please, go ahead and return. I\u2019ll take the blame, James\u201d. With that, I closed the stall door and locked it. \r  \n\r  \nI waited for a response. There was no sound coming from the outside of the stall. James had gone quiet. I was looking down in the opening of the stall under the door. These two neat shoes appeared. I was starting to get creeped out. \u201cUmm... James?\u201d I spoke. \r  \n\r  \nThen, suddenly, blond hair was appearing under the stall door slowly. The neat shoes were still there and hadn\u2019t moved. I kept my eyes on the blond hair as it moved down ever so slightly. I saw a forehead, then eyebrows, then green eyes.  \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat the fuck...\u201d I whispered. \r  \n\r  \nIt was James\u2019 head. It was upside down. His head kept lowering slowly as his nose was now visible. Then his mouth was coming into full view. He was grinning cheek to cheek like always. I was about to scream my lungs out. \r  \n\r  \nThen he said, *\u201cIt\u2019s time to go back\u201d.* \r  \n\r  \n \r  \n\r  \nI will end it here for now. There\u2019s so much more to this occurrence than I can write in one post. I will continue in the next one.",

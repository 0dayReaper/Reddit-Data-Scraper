    "postText": "I parked in the tower's lot, letting my headlights bore into the amalgam of twisted metal and glass for a few moments before shutting them off.\n\nJosh muttered, his voice low. \"We're really doing this, huh?\"\n\nHe ran a hand through his mop of curly hair\u2014 a dumb tic he developed last summer when his girlfriend, Annabeth, told him it was sexy. She was beside him now, cuddled up in the backseat across his lap.\n\nI glanced at my own girlfriend, Ellie, in the passenger seat. She was trying her damndest to appear brave, but I knew better. There was no way she was comfortable with trespassing tonight.\n\nI sighed, realizing that Josh would also chicken out.\n\n\"*We're* doing this? You sure you want to come?\" I prodded.\n\nJosh shifted in his seat, hand running through his hair yet again. \"Maybe it's better if I stay in the truck.\u201d\n\nAnnabeth shrugged next to him, unsurprised.\n\n\"Me, too,\u201d Ellie chimed in, nodding at Josh.\n\nAnnabeth met my eyes, a glimmer of understanding passing between us. Our partners were both boring, god-awful goody two shoes.\n\n\"Pussies,\" I jabbed, swinging open my door without giving them a moment to respond.\n\nAnnabeth hopped out behind me, waving at the two losers in the truck before spinning towards me with a grin on her face.\n\n\"They're weird,\" she said, rolling her eyes.\n\nFor a moment, I was drinking in the way her golden hair shimmered in the moonlight. A light breeze tickled at our faces, sending sparkles of her moon-lit hair between us.\n\n\"Yup,\" I mustered.\n\nI turned, strolling towards the chain link fence that formed a circular perimeter around the base of Sabe's Tower.\n\nSabe\u2019s Tower. Thirteen stories of abandoned potential, whispering of times past when our town's inhabitants thought we'd hit a population boom, becoming the Houston of West Virginia. In the 70s, our success was tied to coal. Jobs flooded in, and with them, a myriad of people trying to make their way in life. Then the mines abruptly ran dry, decimating our town's economy. Since that time, our population has done nothing but dwindle.\n\nSabe\u2019s Tower. Thirteen stories of decaying grandeur, silently rotting from the inside out. Some say that's what happened to Sabe himself\u2014 a rot took hold in his core, spreading and spreading until nothing but rot was left. In the end, he took his own life, which some say was for the best. He was a greedy fool, the wealthiest man for miles, owning half the surrounding countryside before the mining industry took off. Made a fortune selling his family's land to coal companies, putting every ounce of profit into making his towering hotel more luxurious than a Ritz Carlton.\n\nSabe\u2019s Tower. Thirteen stories of failed dreams, now screaming vulgar obscenities at our eyes. It is a truly ugly behemoth, domineering our town's skyline with unmerited arrogance. Sabe thought painting the tower purple would give it an air of majesty, like royalties of the past, swaddled in silky lavender robes. His aspiration, after all, was nothing less than to emulate the sacred Tabernacle of Moses, to make his hotel a dwelling place for gods among men. In its current state of disrepair, however, the tower was no more than an eyesore\u2014 a visual cacophony of broken glass, peeling sickly-purple paint, and rusted steel inlays.\n\nAdding to the hotel's disgrace, it was cylindrical in form, perched atop the highest peak for miles, jutting into the sky like a middle finger to the gods. Its phallic outline stood in stark contrast to the run-down strip malls lying in its wake.\n\nThe fence surrounding the tower was a bit too tall and a bit too wobbly to safely scale, so we circled, looking for an entry point. Every few yards, a DO NOT TRESPASS sign hung, tied to the fence with zip-ties in each corner. Someone had taken the liberty to spray paint a word underneath each sign, now making them all read:\n\n**DO NOT TRESPASS ALONE.**\n\n\"Good thing you're coming with me,\" I joked, pointing at one of the signs.\n\nAnnabeth paused to read it for a moment. \"Yeah... kinda weird that someone did that. I wonder why?\"\n\nI shrugged, continuing around the perimeter.\n\nEventually, we found a gate in the fence, held closed with chains at waist level. The gate's post careened steeply outward, creating a manageable gap near the top. The gate post was only held in place by the chains, not even slightly anchored to the ground. Without too much of a struggle, we hoisted ourselves up and through the gap.\n\nOnce inside the fence, I found myself spellbound by the abandoned hotel. The stars in the night sky reflected across the windows, bending and warping around the curved perimeter. Each glimmer of starlight turned into dizzying fractals, melding together and slipping between the shards of broken glass with each shift of my gaze.\n\nThe result was honestly breathtaking.\n\nAt night, the eyesoriffic tower was beautiful. Its silhouette dared to embrace the star-studded cosmos, standing with a quiet dignity that defied its daytime mockery.\n\nI felt Annabeth shuffle beside me.\n\nSuddenly, her phone flashlight was on, illuminating a path through overgrown concrete to the tower. At the end of the path was the structure\u2019s entrance\u2014 a gaping hole with no attempt to conceal the darkness within.\n\n\"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!\" I yelled, spinning to face her.\n\n\"W... What do you mean?\" she stuttered.\n\n\"Turn that off, you idiot,\" I explained, lowering my voice. \"Someone might see the light and call the cops.\"\n\nThe light flicked off, Annabeth mumbling apologies.\n\nI blinked away the afterimage of weeds eating through the concrete lot, silently cursing myself for being so ridiculously hostile toward her.\n\n\"Sorry,\" I mumbled.\n\n\"You're good, Donovan\" she whispered, brushing her hand across my arm.\n\nAs we continued to the open doorway, the outside of the tower came into focus. It was far further dilapidated than I had realized\u2014 each accent of purple paint, faded and peeling, was bulging out from between the glass and steel like it was trying to escape. I rubbed a fingernail on the paint, revealing a soft, rotting wood beneath.\n\nI entered the tower first, pausing to let my eyes adjust. The darkness of the doorway opened up into an atrium that must have once made for a magnificent entrance. It was shaped like a slice of pie, us standing near the crust, peering inward toward the center. Above was pitch black, not yielding any answers to just how high up this mighty room's ceiling stretched.\n\nThe musty scent that filled my nose was surprisingly welcoming\u2014 somewhere between the smell of fishing trips and century old bookstores. I took a deep breath, relishing in the soft stench.\n\nI could vaguely make out wires dangling down from the ceiling of the atrium. They were impossibly long, stretching upward into the infinite gloom.\n\n\"They look like vines,\" Annabeth whispered, her voice a soft purr.\n\nThe air was thick with falling dust, filtering down from the abyss above, twirling between the wires in satisfyingly slow-motion. The falling dust made it even harder to see in the dark, leaving the walls on either side of the room foggy blobs. I waved my hand, sending fleeting dust spirals through the air.\n\nI remembered seeing photos of the atrium online, taken on some of the earliest digital cameras ever made. Those pictures showed marble countertops, intricate wooden carvings, and lushly carpeted floors.\n\nThe room, as it stands today, is a barren husk of Sabe's vision. The carpet, only present in scattered clumps, was impossibly dark, soiled to the point of true black. It clung to the concrete foundation, viciously holding on for dear life in a losing battle.\n\nI bent down to examine a clump of carpet in front of me, amazed by the absence of light reflecting back. It was like staring into a pit of nothing, a vague absence, an outline of something that should be there.\n\nI poked the toe of my boot at it.\n\n*FPOOSH.*\n\nIt exploded, erupting into my face.\n\nI gagged instinctively, tasting the vile substance mix into my lungs. Annabeth slapped my back as I continued gagging and coughing, begging the mucus to tear itself free from my lungs and *just fucking get out of my body because it feels like I'm dying oh GOD.*\n\nAnd eventually, it did.\n\nThe violent hacking subsided into slight wretching, then was gone.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" Annabeth tested.\n\n*Do you think I'm fucking okay?*\n\n\"What the fuck was that?\" I spewed.\n\nShe bent over the clump of carpet. Underneath the blackened top layer that just violently erupted was a pale network of matted spiderwebs.\n\n\"Hmm...\" she began, \"It kind of looks like mycelium.\"\n\nShe met my raised eyebrow with an eye roll.\n\n\"You know, like the roots of a fungus or some shit, I don't know. I just saw the shrooms growing in Bryce's closet that one time he showed me his stash. This white stuff looks just like it. So I guess that makes this black stuff like the part of the shroom we eat, or whatever.\"\n\n\"Oh dip,\" I responded, nodding. \"That makes sense. One time I saw a nature show about some plants that shoot their seeds everywhere when something touches them. It's probably just spreading its spores when we touch it.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" she breathed, \"pretty gnarly.\"\n\nWe shuffled deeper into the gloom, weaving between dangling cables and clumps of fungus. I felt a drop of moisture flick off a cable, sliding onto my arm.\n\nI groaned. \"Fuck. That cable was wet.\"\n\n\"Disgusting,\" she whispered back.\n\nWe made our way to the apex of the room, the center of the tower, revealing a rusted set of elevator doors leaning together like drunks at a quinceanera. The doorway to the stairs, however, beckoned to us with the same unobstructed, pitch-black allure that the tower's entrance emanated just minutes before.\n\nIn the dark, it's truly amazing how utterly void all open doorways look.\n\nUpon stepping inside the stairwell, the world vanished. The only proof of having working eyes was a faint, vertical glow of light filtering through the door, abruptly fading into all-consuming black.\n\nEvery sound in the entire building bored through my soul, bouncing from wall to wall, ceiling to floor, echoing on and on for all of eternity. The stairwell, directly in the center of the decrepit hotel, was the focal point of every creaking floorboard, every popping nail, every howling gust of wind. It was as if I was holding up a monstrous conch shell to my ear\u2014 a deafening murmur of echoes in disarray, smelting together to form satanic harmonies.\n\n\"Whoa,\" Annabeth mumbled.\n\nHer word cut through the other echoes, impossibly loud against their monotonous hum.\n\nInstantly, the echo of her voice filled the stairwell, rising like the build up of a dubstep song until peaking, impossibly overwhelming for a few brief seconds. The echoes of her voice then faded as quickly as they arrived.\n\nShe put a hand to her mouth, the whites of her eyes barely visible in the glow coming from the doorway.\n\nI reached out, placing a hand where her shoulder should be. There was not enough space for us to stand abreast in the stairwell, leaving us in a comically squished proximity. She was breathing rapidly, barely managing to stay silent. I squeezed, and her breathing quickly slowed. I felt her hand creep onto mine, and we stood for a minute, simply listening to the cries of the dying building echo around us.\n\nAs my eyes adjusted, I could make out a staircase spiraling up the curved wall. Clearly this was a service stairwell, as it is much too cramped for the likes of Sabe's guests. Only a few steps were visible through the darkness at a time, making the staircase feel even tinier than it already was. Luckily, no fungus grew on the stairs themselves, leaving the metal alone to rust.\n\nAnnabeth shuffled onto the first step, producing a small object from her pocket. She handed it to me, then pointed up the stairwell, careful to not send echoes through the cylindrical chamber again.\n\nI brought it close to my eyes for inspection, straining against the lack of light.\n\n*A joint...*\n\n*She wants to go to the roof and smoke.*\n\nA smile cracked my lips. Classic Annabeth.\n\nEvery couple stairsteps, there would be a doorway. Most of them let in a dim glow, offering a glimpse into what must have once been a custodial closet on each floor.\n\nOn floor 9, I tugged at Annabeth's hand. We made eye contact in the faint light coming from the doorway. I motioned through it, pointing to the nearly fungus free floor. I wanted to explore at least a little bit, to see if the closet circled around the stairwell or not.\n\nI poked my head through the doorway, freeing myself from the overwhelming cacophony of echoes in the stairwell.\n\nI verified that the closet did, in fact, curve around the circular staircase like a donut. A few steps in one direction led to a terrifying drop\u2014 the elevator shaft. Next to it, a sidewalk sized ledge led to an open door, giving a view of the floor's main hallway. The path looked safe\u2014 no fungus, cracks, or otherwise obvious defects\u2014 so I proceeded, treading as light as a fox, fumbling for Annabeth's hand behind me.\n\nThe main hallway ran between the custodial closet and the guest rooms, creating another donut ring around the central stairwell. Throughout the hallway, patches of fungus grew alarmingly close together, threatening to overtake the concrete.\n\n\"That stairwell was insane,\" Annabeth whispered.\n\nI nodded. \"Fuck yeah, I wonder what it was like when the hotel was actually open. Must have been miserable for the staff.\"\n\nWe weaved through the fungus filled hallway, coming to room 901. I glanced at Annabeth, raising my eyebrows. The door was slightly ajar, hanging from its one remaining door hinge. I pushed gently, eliciting a monstrous creak.\n\nThe room was empty, extending away to the outside in a familiar pie shape. The mold seemed to grow thinner in the room, leaving most of the exposed concrete safe to cross. At the far side, a floor to ceiling panel of windows looked out over our town.\n\nI gasped, taking in the view. Never before had I seen our town from this high up. My eyes drew to the smokestacks by the river, their blinking lights ominously flickering over downtown. Individual streets ran in parallel lines away from the tower, lit with yellowing streetlights. Between the roads, tiny lights cast from window panes twinkled, blending with one another into a starscape of their own.\n\n\"Dude,\" I said. \"Look at this.\"\n\nNo response.\n\nI spun, looking for Annabeth, frantically scanning the room. My eyes had adjusted to the outside light, leaving me sightless.\n\n\"*Annabeth,*\" I hissed.\n\nA cold tingle went up my spine, pulling at hairs on the back of my neck.\n\n\"*Annabeth?*\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSilence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSilence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSilence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI crept back across the floor, now aware of the entire room at once. There was nowhere for her to be hiding. No desks, cans of paint, ladders, nothing. Just an empty room with patchy fungus growing on the cement.\n\n*Something must have happened.*\n\nI studied each fungal growth in the room as I passed by. Even with the light cast from the windows, the tops remained impossibly dark. Not a single feature was discernible\u2014 only an outline was visible.\n\nHalfway to the door, a three foot wide hole led straight to floor 8. I could have sworn it wasn't there before. I peered into the opening, seeing straight through to the room below. From what I could see, it was identically empty.\n\n\"*Annabeth,*\" I tried again, nearing the door to the hallway.\n\n\"BOO!\"\n\nI stumbled backward, tripping over my own feet. I landed squarely on a patch of fungus.\n\n*FPOOSH.*\n\nI remembered to hold my breath, close my eyes, and plug my nose.\n\nAnnabeth cackled from the threshold of the doorway, standing over me with both hands on her forehead.\n\n\"You should have seen the look\u2014\" she began, breaking off into another fit of laughter.\n\n\"Shut up,\" I groaned, pushing to my feet. My entire body was covered in squishy fungus gunk. I pointed at the hole behind me, continuing. \"You could have killed me.\"\n\n\"Blah, blah, blah,\" she mocked. \"You're fine... you're just being a baby.\"\n\nAnnabeth gave me a playful shove, hands lingering for a moment overdue. Swatting her paws off me, I marched back to the stairwell. I led the rest of the way to floor 13, followed by her snickers.\n\nAs I reached the top of the stairs and stepped onto the 13th floor, my jaw dropped. It was a scene straight out of a surrealist painting. An enormous pool room lay before us. Glass walls extended up from the tile floors, creating a massive, clear domed perimeter. A swath of stars twinkled brilliantly through the clear ceiling, their light refracting through the glass, casting ethereal patterns onto the room's otherwise bleak surroundings.\n\nThe pool itself was a semi-circular cutout covering half the floor space, starting at ground level and deepening in a corkscrew motion. Its ceramic tiles, once probably a bright blue, were now tinged with patches of the same fungal growth we had come across on the lower floors. The growth was sparse here, though, letting the original floor design take prominence.\n\nIn the center of the room\u2014 on top of the staircase we just stepped out of\u2014 stood a circular pillar that extended up to the middle of the glass dome, like a spine holding up the entire tower. A small antenna jutted out from above the pillar atop the dome. Surrounding the antenna was a low fence, perhaps a safety measure for maintenance workers.\n\nAnnabeth, having finally contained her laughter, stepped beside me, her face illuminated by the soft starlight filtering in through the dome. She too stood silent, taken aback by the unexpected beauty of this forgotten space.\n\nAs we moved around the room, our steps echoed across the vast emptiness. With every patch of fungus we passed, the same eerie darkness hovered, the undulating mold standing stark against the ceramic tiles.\n\nWe made our way back to the central pillar. A ladder, carved into the pillar, connected to the glass ceiling with a trapdoor.\n\n\"To the roof?\" Annabeth sang, rubbing her hands together in a goblin-like motion.\n\n\"Ladies first.\"\n\nAs she climbed above me, I couldn't help but crane my neck and drool. She slammed open the trapdoor, and we burst through to the roof.\n\nThe fenced-in area was covered with a dark spongy surface, gripping at my knees when I stood up. Wind whipped around us, carrying a chill that cut through my clothes and bit into my skin. With each gust, the antenna above us groaned and swayed, almost as if it were joining in a dance with an unseen partner.\n\nWe sat on the squishy rubber surface, comfortably in silence. I met her eyes, smiling dumbly. We passed the joint back and forth until it dwindled down, its ember glow flickering one last time before extinguishing completely. A familiar haze crawled through my thoughts, slowing the passage of time to a languishing crawl.\n\n\"Hey...\" she started, \"I think I've finally found inspiration for my next album.\"\n\nI scooted closer to her, taking her hand. I knew the topic brought about an unusual timidity in her\u2014 a blemish in the badass persona she's so keen on presenting. She won't even talk to her own boyfriend about her music career.\n\n\"Yeah?\" I floated.\n\nShe hesitated for a second, settling into the moment. I felt a tug at my crotch, suddenly all too aware of how pretty she looked in the moonlight. I took in every detail\u2014 the way her hair fell across her face, the pattern of her freckles, the soft speckling of stars reflecting across her eyes.\n\n\"I think you need to take off your shirt, first, though,\" she whispered, now inches from my face. \"You're filthy.\"\n\nI glanced down, remembering the fungal gunk that had soiled my clothes when she scared me.\n\nWithout warning, her hands slid under my shirt, warm and sure. I helped her yank it off, collapsing into her lips.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen we got back to the truck, I was still high enough to see everything in slow motion. Before pulling out of the parking lot, Annabeth and I regurgitated the events of our urban exploration, trying to show our significant others what fun they missed out on. It goes without saying that part of the story was intentionally omitted.\n\nEllie and Josh were unamused. Their lack of adventure will forever be a mystery to me.\n\nWe swung out of the lot, hopping onto the highway headed into town. I swayed between lanes, struggling to keep the double-yellow lines in focus.\n\n\"Are you sure you're good to drive?\" Ellie asked, gripping the armrest.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" I slurred.\n\nSeconds later, another truck materialized in front of us. I swerved to avoid it, then everything went black.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI woke up to a strong hand pulling me out of the window. My truck was upside down, the roof completely caved in.\n\nI groaned. \"Aww... fuck....\"\n\nThe person who pulled me out looked like the kind of guy to chew tobacco and spit wisdom. His fishing cap cast a deep shadow across his eyes in the moon's glow, concealing his gaze. He was an old timer, that's for sure, one of those folk who came during the coal rush and decided to stay when all was said and done. I could see his truck\u2014 the same truck I saw moments before the crash\u2014 pulled into the shoulder of the highway with its blinkers on.\n\n\"Easy now,\" he reassured, his voice like gravel under a boot. \"Anyone else inside?\"\n\nI nodded, unable to speak.\n\nI plopped onto the grassy slope embarking off the side of the road. The old man pulled their mangled bodies out, one by one.\n\nThe countryside shrank around me. I felt the corners of my vision pulling in, the weed in my system straining the limits of shock I could take before melting down.\n\n\"I'm sorry, son,\" he whispered, his voice carrying the weight of my guilt. \"The police will be here soon. Don't you worry.\"\n\n*The police.*\n\nI stood up. I knew exactly how the police treated people with my skin color in this town.\n\nI ran.\n\n\"Hey now!\" the man hollered.\n\nI kept running.\n\nAway from my truck, away from my dead friends, away from the police.\n\nI ran until my breath came in ragged, uncontrollable huffs. I flopped to the ground, laying on the cool concrete, cradling my head with my hands. Blood flowed between my fingertips, pooling onto the pavement.\n\nI laid there until police sirens wailed through the night, rapidly approaching. They stopped at the wreck, leaving me in silence. Moments later, the sirens picked up their mournful song again, heading toward me.\n\nI sat up.\n\nI was back in the lot of Sabe's Tower. Only then did I realize how little distance I really ran from the wreck\u2014 a couple hundred yards at most.\n\nFour, five, maybe even six sirens filled the air. They were all coming for me. They knew what I had done.\n\nI bolted from my position on the concrete. I could hide in the tower. No way the cops would look for me in that rotting place. They wouldn't dare.\n\nI squeezed through the gap in the fence, same as before, vaulting past the\n\n**DO NOT TRESPASS ALONE**\n\nsigns in a fluid lunge. The sirens behind me screamed into the night, melding together into a continuous doomsday chant.\n\nRed and blue lights filled the lot. I hit the ground right in front of the gaping entrance to the tower, praying that the weeds poking through the concrete would be enough to mask my form. I army crawled, inch by inch, dragging myself across broken bottles and plywood shrapnell, until I was safely in the darkness of the tower.\n\nIn.\n\nOut.\n\nI breathed.\n\nIn.\n\nOut.\n\nA police cruiser parked in the lot. Its siren drowned out all other wails for a moment before shutting off. A chubby white officer hopped out, surveying the scene. His gaze came to rest on the spot where I had lain. He squatted down, raking a finger through the pool of blood I left behind. He took a few steps toward the tower, squatting down yet again. Another splotch of blood, no doubt.\n\nHis voice floated through the plaza, slightly nasal and a little out of breath. \"Dispatch, this is officer Chetty, badge number 741. I'm on the scene at 1019 Pleasant Valley Lane, in the lot of Sabe's Tower. I've located a pool of fresh blood that may be linked to our hit-and-run suspect. Possible injury, suspect could be close. Requesting immediate backup and forensics for evidence collection.\"\n\n*Fuck.*\n\nI wormed my way further into the tower's belly, sliding between patches of fungus like a mouse in a snake pit, heading for the stairwell. I had to ascend, to find some nook or cranny out of reach of the pursuing officers. The godforsaken tower was one big game of hide and seek, only this time, losing meant far worse than a bruised ego.\n\nSomething gurgled in the darkness.\n\nMy blood froze. I halted, my heart hammering a tattoo against my ribs. Holding my breath, I strained my senses, eyes peering into the graying murk, searching for the source of the sound.\n\nIt came again, a wretched retching, like an animal choking on its own vomit. Hacking, gurgling, bubbling wetness bursting through strained vocal chords, a sound of fading vitality. It was coming from near the door, just outside the meager halo of light slipping through the hole.\n\nA wet line smeared across the back of my neck. A yelp escaped my lips before I realized it was just a cord dangling from the ceiling.\n\nAt my yelp, the gurgling paused.\n\nA heavy hush fell over the place, the quietude of the hunted.\n\nI could faintly make out echoes emanating from the stairwell, only a few feet behind me.\n\nThe gurgling continued, sucking at the thick air. It began to drag itself forward through the fungus covered floor\u2014 a slow, steady, rhythmic drag against the concrete.\n\n*FPOOSH.*\n\nA geyser of spores bloomed, mingling with swirls of dust in the meager light. The creature, or whatever it was, did not slow its approach. Out of the darkness, a form began to shape\u2014 a silhouette clawing its way toward me.\n\n*FPOOSH.*\n\nI could see this eruption envelop the mass on the floor. One hand appeared, then another. Its fingers scrabbled over the concrete, searching for any purchase to grip. They flexed, heaving the thing even closer.\n\nA mop of curly hair appeared between the hands. A body, face down. It pulled itself closer, into another fungal growth, grinding its face through the rough concrete.\n\n*FPOOSH.*\n\nA knife protruded from its back. The handle jutted upward, a grim totem amidst the grime and gore. I shuddered, involuntarily taking a step closer to the stairwell.\n\nIt looked up at me.\n\nOr rather, Josh looked up at me.\n\nI stared back, mouth agape.\n\nHis face was nearly sanded off from the concrete. His nose took the worst of it, ground down to the bone, leaving only two sucking, gurgling holes between his eyes. His cheeks were a mangled mess of blood and rocks, viscous red flowing freely to the tip of his chin before dribbling off. The chunks of meat hanging where lips should have been flapped against his teeth with every jerky motion, tethered to his face by all too little strands of flesh. Beneath them, his teeth showed bright red and white in a perpetual grimacing smile.\n\n\"Josh?\" I managed to whisper, my voice a frightened squeak.\n\nJosh opened his mouth as if to respond, ripping both cheeks in half. He hacked, gurgling, spitting up blood that came from deep within his torso. He slowly cocked his head to the side, but instead of stopping at a slant, he kept twisting his neck until bones started to crack and his head dangled upside down.\n\nHis mangled, upside down head swung limply as he pulled himself to his knees, his neck like jelly. He wasn't wearing the same clothes he was wearing earlier tonight\u2014 no, he was wearing clothes from the night Annabeth first cheated on him with me. He was at a Villanova game, supporting his favorite team since birth. Annabeth knew he would be gone for the weekend, so we took our chance. I was still at her place when he came back, wearing his Collin Gillespie jersey and reeking of beer.\n\nNow in front of me, his prized jersey was in tatters, torn to ribbons by the concrete. He groaned, shuffling and reaching for me with bloody fingers.\n\nI bolted into the stairwell, taking the steps two at a time. I pushed myself faster and faster until the door to floor 9 loomed to my side. I didn't pause for a moment, pushed forward by the gurgling echoes reverberating from below.\n\nMy thighs, weak from the frantic climb, begged for a break. I wobbled into the hallway, painfully tip-toeing through the fungus. The door to 901 beckoned ahead, hanging open like it had been awaiting my hasty return.\n\nI stumbled over the threshold when Annabeth's singing filled the room. \"*Oh, Donovan!*\"\n\nI froze.\n\nOutlined against the window was a two-headed beast. One face belonged to Annabeth, the other to Ellie. The creature swayed, an obscene dance of bare, fused flesh. It wore no clothes, as if to mock God himself. It had two sets of everything\u2014 eight appendages total, like a humanoid arachnid. Annabeth's breasts, now side by side with Ellie's, put Ellie to shame, even now.\n\nAnnabeth crooned again, \"Oh, Donovan!\" each syllable laced with acid and honey. The sound made my skin crawl as it floated through the silent room.\n\n\"You always did want more, didn't you Donovan?\" Ellie sneered, a harsh grin splitting her face.\n\nAnnabeth spat, \"More than Ellie could give. More than anyone could give.\"\n\nThe thing dropped to the floor with a thud. All eight limbs moved in unison as it crawled.\n\n\"Isn't this what you wanted? Both of us at the same time?\" Their voices tumbled over each other, mouths moving in synchrony. Together, their laughter filled the hollow room. \"Don't you like the thrill, Donovan? Don't you like playing with fire?\"\n\nThe thing scurried at me, jumping over fungal growths with powerful leaps. The sudden movement broke my paralyzation, spurring my legs to action. I darted into the closet and through the stairwell door, into the gurgling echoes.\n\nBack down the stairwell I ran, the two headed beast in pursuit. Both girls snarled, hindered by their conjoined size in the narrow passageway. Their struggle echoed through the stairwell, mixing with the gurgling. I fled further down, needing to put distance between that thing and me.\n\nI stopped dead in my tracks between floors 2 and 3.\n\nJosh was there, leaning against the wall with the knife removed from his back, now grasped tightly in his hand. I staggered back up the stairs, instinctively retreating, narrowly avoiding the blade as he lunged at me.\n\nGlancing up, I caught a flash of pale skin bearing down on me, cutting off my escape. My only way out was the door to floor 3. I charged through the closet, leaving the echoes behind me.\n\nFloor 3 was empty\u2014 no walls, only fungus and windows. The atrium loomed to my left, a pie shaped hole missing from the floor and ceiling. I backed away from the door, eyeing the dangling cords hanging in the atrium.\n\n*Maybe... Just maybe....*\n\nJosh stumbled from the stairwell, filling the air with his wet slurping. Annabeth and Ellie followed, scrambling toward me.\n\nI didn't have time to think.\n\nI jumped, grasping at the dangling wires, praying they would hold my weight.\n\nTime stuttered, hanging suspended like an icicle on a winter's morning. The world spun in a dizzying blur as I twisted, fingers stretching for a grip. Panic clawed its icy fingers up my spine, but it was the surprise that struck me most. The simple disbelief that this was happening.\n\nA wire found its way into my hand, snapping without slowing my fall.\n\nThe wind whooshed past, ripping the breath from my lungs. Above me, the third floor retreated, its grimy concrete replaced by a view of the atrium's ceiling, wires swinging back and forth from my desperate escape.\n\nThen came the sensation of falling. It's a feeling that strikes a primal chord, an orchestra of fear and adrenaline that means the end of a life. My stomach lurched, free-falling alongside me, while the rest of my body seemed to hover in a state of disbelief.\n\nThe impact came as both a shock and an inevitability. There was a moment of sheer, undiluted pain, a soundless scream reverberating through my very bones. It felt like being shattered from the inside out, an explosion of agony that started from my back and radiated outwards. An iron-hot spike of pain shot through me, and then, a chilling void as everything below my waist slipped into a terrifying numbness.\n\nThe echo of my body's collision rang in my ears as the world spun into a disorienting whirl of blurs, shadows, and pain. The cold concrete beneath me felt real, solid, a chilling contrast to the sudden loss of sensation in my legs.\n\nIn the throbbing silence that followed, I understood. I had fallen. I was broken. I lay sprawled on the atrium floor, gasping, the world tilting dangerously in my vision.\n\nAnnabeth and Ellie emerged from the staircase, scrambling across the atrium floor. Red and blue police lights filtered through the tower\u2019s windows, making shadows dance between the monster's eight limbs. Josh wasn't far behind, still clutching onto the bloody knife, head rolling upside down between his shoulders.\n\n\"Police, we're coming in!\" a familiar nasally voice shouted.\n\nThe moment officers stepped foot in the tower, the monsters vanished in a spray of spores.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/bingybongy/comments/13k527x/start_here/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)",

It didn't even cross my mind that the reason was because you wanted both of them and that Annabeth was keeping up the act (probably would be sus if you still hung out with her without your friend right). \n\nBut, I think that it's poetic irony that you mangled them all emotionally and physically just to be done the same to. Fortunately, you didn't die from it and now you get to spend the rest of your life in jail with all of the time in the world to think about that night and your friends and your selfishness. Death would have been too kind for you.",

    "postText": "[\\[Part 4\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1373iid/i_trapped_a_monster_in_my_garden_shed_part_4/)\n\nClack.\r  \nI jerked from my slumped position against the wall and winced at the soreness in my tight muscles. If I kept falling asleep in anyplace other than my own bed, I would soon be walking like my aged father, with a cane and a hunchback.\r  \nClack.\r  \nCraning my head around, I peered through the open door of the storage closet, and saw the sanctuary bathed in carpets of fresh sunlight. Birds chirped outside, and the whispers had finally stopped. Aside from myself, the storage closet stood empty.\r  \nClack, clack, clack.\r  \nI froze, and all the hairs on my body stood on end. It was as if someone had smacked a stick or a tree branch against the church\u2019s white-painted clapboard siding. It was morning, the day had come. Nothing should have still been out there.\r  \n*Wait . . . where\u2019s Cricket?*\r  \nMy eyes flicked to the double doors of the sanctuary, and I saw they stood slightly ajar, the padlock and chain lying on the floor.\r  \nA loud, primal screech pierced the air, right on the other side of the wall, from where the clacking had come.\r  \n\u201cOh man, oh man, oh man.\u201d I stumbled to my feet and ran for the door, my Winchester in hand. Leaping through the doorframe, I vaulted down the steps to sprint around the corner.\r  \nSour knots worked through my stomach, and I skidded to a halt.\r  \nCricket stood a few yards off, and not six feet from her, one of the bone-faced deer thrashed in combat with the shrubbery. It\u2019s branch-like antlers were tangled in what looked like a discarded tennis net, and the old, frayed cordage had caught in the bushes that lined the church\u2019s walls. With every panicked jerk the creature made to free itself, it rattled its bizarre antlers against the siding, making the signature clack, I\u2019d heard earlier.\r  \nDespite this, I could only gape with amazement and fear at the size of the being. It stood taller than any deer I\u2019d ever seen, easily eight feet high at the scalp, with a spread of antlers that could have frightened a moose. The deer\u2019s head bore the same eerie exposed sections of bone as the others, and both eye sockets were dark as shadow.\r  \n\u201cCricket, get back!\u201d With clammy fingers, I racked the lever on my rifle to chamber a gleaming 30-30 cartridge.\r  \nShe jumped in front of the raised barrel, waving both hands. \u201cNo! Don\u2019t shoot, please!\u201d\r  \n*Does she not see the freaking mutant deer?*\r  \nI blinked at her, but Cricket laced both hands together in a pleading gesture, her sad eyes rooting me to the spot.\r  \n\u201cHe\u2019s not dangerous.\u201d She insisted and inched toward the enormous stag. \u201cWatch.\u201d\r  \n\u201cCricket . . .\u201d I warned and tightened my fingers on the rifle.\r  \nShe edged up to the deer and held out a hand to stroke at the huge, muscled neck of the beast. \u201cEasy. Easy boy, it\u2019s okay. I know it hurts, but you\u2019ll feel better soon.\u201d\r  \nStunned, I watched her reach up to the creature\u2019s face, and pat it like an overgrown dog, the deer\u2019s struggle ceasing to a few nervous jerks. With this done, Cricket slid her pale fingers to the dark eyes sockets and gouged into them with her fingernail.\r  \nCrunch.\r  \nA few whimpers came from the animal, but it let her pry one greasy chunk of black crust from its head after another, until a glistening dark eyeball peered back at us.\r  \nCricket smiled, and gently turned the deer\u2019s head to get at the other eye. \u201cThere you go. Feels good, huh? Can I get this stuff off your pretty antlers too?\u201d\r  \nAs if trained in an obedience school the huge deer lowered its head, and Cricket tugged at the mass of tangled netting.\r  \nShe looked back over her shoulder at me, golden hair flowing over her shoulders in a river of sunlight. \u201cWe have to get him loose. Do you have something we could cut this with?\u201d\r  \nOpen mouthed with surprise, I dashed back inside to my desk. A pair of black-handled scissors slid into my pocket, and I ran outside.\r  \nI stopped a few yards away, and cleared my throat.\r  \nCricket met my frightened gaze, and made a warm, reassuring grin. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I told him you\u2019re not scary. Come here.\u201d\r  \n*You did what?*\r  \nSlowly, I tiptoed closer, walked right up to the nightmarish mutant, all four limbs shaking.\r  \nA pleasant warmth coursed through my left hand, and I looked down to find her fingers wound around mine. Cricket\u2019s golden irises locked onto me, and her cheeks tinged a rosy pink.\r  \n\u201cWatch.\u201d She raised my hand to place it on the deer\u2019s neck.\r  \nSatin bristles slid under my palm, and I could feel every twitch of the animal\u2019s muscles, its nervous breaths, the thumping of an artery as it pushed blood to its heart. On its ragged face, I could discern a slight wriggle of the deer\u2019s tender flesh, as if it were moving into place in an almost sentient way, healing over the bone that had widened to make the skull thicker, larger, stronger. I looked up into its baleful chestnut-brown eye, now clear of the sooty black crust, and saw my tiny reflection looking back. This thing didn\u2019t want to harm me. It had gotten its head stuck trying to scrape the scum from its eyes on the bushes.\r  \n*The sunlight. It went out in the sunlight, just like she did.*\r  \n\u201cSee?\u201d Beside me, Cricket beamed, and stroked the animal\u2019s face with careful, light touches. \u201cNot dangerous.\u201d\r  \nI gasped out a bewildered chuckle, and dared to keep petting the thing, its fur soft as a terry-cloth robe. \u201cH-How did you do that?\u201d\r  \nHer smile faltered a little at that, and Cricket frowned at the hand she held to the deer\u2019s neck like she had just awoken from a dream. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know.\u201d\r  \nTaking the scissors from my pocket, I cut away the nylon strands of tennis net, and let the regal beast shake his head free of the bush.\r  \nHe gave us both a snort, which I could almost have imagined as a gruff thank you, and trotted off toward a distant herd of his fellows, who were busy rubbing their heads on a few square tombstones at the border of the forest to peel the crust from their eyes. The morning rang with the song of birds, though I noticed a few unfamiliar tunes, as if other creatures in the treetops had joined in, ones like the deer that no longer feared the sun. All around me, the air smelled sweet, sweeter than I remembered, and a few frogs croaked a happy chorus.\r  \nA finger poked my shoulder, and I turned to face Cricket.\r  \nShe kept both eyes on her feet and dug her bare toes into the damp grass. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for scaring you. I saw him through the window, and figured he needed help. That stuff on his eyes . . .\u201d\r  \n\u201cWas the same as the stuff on you.\u201d I finished, glancing down where a few pieces of the crust lay. \u201cYou said you told him I wasn\u2019t scary. And he listened to you.\u201d\r  \nCricket winced and rubbed her arm self-consciously. \u201cIs that weird?\u201d\r  \n*Everything here is weird.*\r  \nCurious, I threw a look back at the herd of deer, grazing in the rays of the sunrise. \u201cNot weird. Just different. Can . . . can you actually talk to them?\u201d\r  \nHer face shaded a deeper crimson, and Cricket shuffled her feet. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s more like . . . I don\u2019t know, like I can tell how they feel about something. I don\u2019t actually hear them talking, not like the white-eyed things.\u201d\r  \nAt that last bit, she shivered, and cast a furtive glare at the trees. They were still in there, we both knew it, spying on our every move. Of all the strange animals we\u2019d seen so far, the humanoid, white-eyed wooden-skinned freaks seemed to be the smartest, and the most relentless.\r  \n\u201cWe should name them.\u201d\r  \nI emerged from my musings to find Cricket\u2019s smile had returned. \u201cWhat, like, \u2018Spot\u2019 and \u2018Lucky\u2019?\u201d\r  \nShe giggled and rolled her eyes. \u201cNo, not like that. I mean, they\u2019re a new species, right? All of the stuff that comes out at night is. We should name them.\u201d\r  \n\rCradling the Winchester in my left arm, I nodded toward the deer. \u201cOkay, go ahead.\u201d\r  \n\u201cNo way.\u201d She crossed both arms and gave me a small smirk. \u201cYou have to.\u201d\r  \n\u201cMe? Why me?\u201d\r  \n\u201cBecause you saw them first.\u201d She held up a finger like some kind of gorgeous college professor. \u201cAnd because you were here before me. Besides, this is your land anyway.\u201d\r  \nThis time, I rolled my eyes, and set both hands on my hips. \u201cIt\u2019s God\u2019s land, Cricket. And it\u2019s your home too, now. Tell you what, we flip a coin, and whoever wins gets to name whichever species we\u2019re on. Deal?\u201d\r  \nA glimmer came into her golden irises, and once again, Cricket\u2019s smile took my breath away. \u201cDeal.\u201d\r  \nInstead of fearing the dark, I began to look forward to it, when Cricket and I would climb the ladder inside the old church bell tower with a pair of binoculars to study everything that came out of the trees. I took more technical notes, while Cricket drew the creatures on a notepad I\u2019d given her. With every passing day, more and more species ventured into the sunrise, and as they did, they changed from nightmarish, incomplete freaks, to bizarre yet beautiful creatures.\r  \nThe Bone-Faced Whitetail were huge, graceful animals, with soft brown fur the color of new oxford shoes. They bordered on the domesticated side whenever Cricket approached, nuzzling her outstretched hand for sugar lumps, and licked her face until the girl laughed. She had such a way with the animals, as if they could sense she too was new to this world, and many of the critters trusted her implicitly. I had to be much more cautious, but eventually I could walk up to the gentle creatures and pet them while they grazed.\r  \nCricket named the bat-winged lizard creatures Firedrakes for the bright blaze of color that each bore on their snouts. They stood about knee-high, and walked on all fours like a pterodactyl, with folded leathery wings and scaly black bodies that ended in a long, arrow-shaped head. They had no less than six eyes, three to a side, and long whip-like tails that they could use to hold on to things like a lemur might. Firedrakes loved shiny things, especially coins, and we\u2019d toss spare pennies we found in the living room couch to get them close enough to observe.\r  \nNew plants sprouted to life as well, Lantern Roses that glowed yellow and orange at night, Dancing Waterlilies that swayed on their own and smelled like fruity cereal, and the Bomb Creeper vine that exploded with razor-sharp needles if you got too close. Thankfully, I could rely on Cricket\u2019s built-in sixth sense to guide me through these discoveries without fatal injury, but not all the newcomers were cute and cuddly.\r  \nBirds with cellphones for heads collected in the pines along the ridgetop, their cracked touchscreens chiming in eerie, off-pitch ringtones as they flocked through the night sky. A few rusted cars stalked along on in a nearby marsh on bent, distended axels, their old tires lying flat like feet, with flickering yellow headlights that peered into the darkness. Mud-spattered radios scuttled over the gravel county road like crabs, playing fragments of retro music in disorganized patterns that almost sounded like crude sentences. Enormous Iron Spiders that masqueraded as signal towers during the day roamed in small herds of five or six individuals at night, bellowing with loud fog-horn calls from their satellite-dish heads. Once, I could have sworn I spotted our old red mailbox skittering through the marsh on four legs like an insect, but I couldn\u2019t be sure.\r  \nAs for the Lost Ones, the white-eyed fiends that had been my first monster sighting, they still came often, and fixated on the church with manic attention. Calling out to them didn\u2019t help, either from Cricket or myself, and their numbers swelled from a few dozen to over a hundred in three days\u2019 time. Eventually, Cricket and I retreated to the storage closet whenever they showed up. During these dark moments, I\u2019d read the Bible to Cricket, along with other books from my little library. Explaining God to someone again after so long of being on my own felt good, even if we were trapped in a broom closet with the world falling apart in a slow-motion apocalypse all around us.\r  \nBut things weren\u2019t all sunshine and Lantern Roses.\r  \nOur food stocks were dwindling. Cricket\u2019s appetite dropped after the first day or so to normal human levels, but still, I only had maybe a month\u2019s worth of supplies left for both of us. My ammunition stocks were critically low, and my phone couldn\u2019t even get through to the police anymore. Service dipped from erratic, to virtuously non-existent, and I went for days at a time without even trying to upload anything. Cricket had nightmares that dragged her from slumber with cold sweats and terrified screams, and it got to where she couldn\u2019t sleep unless I was somewhere nearby to wake her when the mumbling started.\r  \nThen, came last night.\r  \nI sat in the front pew of the dark sanctuary, staring up at the wooden cross bolted to the wall, my mind a whirlwind of prayer and confused thoughts. Outside, the Lost Ones whispered and scratched, digging their chipped fingernails into the faded wood planks like carpenter bees. It was a cool night, the room chilly, the night sky a deep ebony on the other side of the windows.\r  \nShutting my eyes, I prayed like I never had before, searching, seeking some message of wisdom. \u201cWhy are you doing this Adonai? We have nowhere to go, and soon, nothing to eat. The beasts are too many, and honestly, I\u2019m afraid. We\u2019re trapped. Please, help me see your will in this.\u201d\r  \nI sat there in the murky shadows, waiting for something, anything.\r  \n*My ways are not your ways, my thoughts are not your thoughts, sayeth the Lord.*\r  \nThat verse again. How many times had I passed it in the kitchen these many days? Was it just coincidence, a flash of memory, a reflex of my mind? It was so hard to know sometimes if God was speaking to me, or if I was grasping at straws.\r  \nWhop.\r  \nMy ears twitched, and I straightened up, cocking my head to one side.\r  \nWhop-whop-whop.\r  \nInside my chest, my heart began to pound, and I threw myself toward the nearest high-set window. An empty black sky greeted my eyes, tinged by the glow of a pale moon, but just on the other side of the trees, I thought I could see a flicker of white light.\r  \nThey exploded from the horizon, four large helicopters winging in over the foliage, their blinding white searchlights flicking on to probe at the ground. All around the church, the Lost Ones screeched and scattered, a few of the Bone-Faced Whitetail darted for cover, and the Firedrakes on the roof took to the sky.\r  \n\u201cCricket.\u201d I thundered into the parsonage and ran to shake her awake in the spare bedroom. \u201cGet up. Get up, we have to go, come on.\u201d\r  \nShe jolted upright, her blonde hair askew, dressed in an old green t-shirt and checkered blue flannel pants. Her eyes winced at the light from the hallway, bleary and half-awake. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\r  \nCrack.\r  \nA muffled shot rang out, and somewhere in the darkness, one of the Lost Ones screamed out in pain.\r  \nBlood surged in my temples, and I grabbed her hand to sprint for the front door. \u201cOutside. There are people outside, come on.\u201d\r  \nMore gunshots filled the air in sporadic bursts, and I fumbled with the cold padlock on the doors of the sanctuary. We were close, so close to being rescued, to flying out of here and finding a way to fix this mess.\r  \n\u201cAdam,\u201d Cricket stepped back from the door, her golden eyes flashing in uncertainty at the sound of the helicopters touching down just outside the grassy cemetery. \u201cI don\u2019t know about this.\u201d\r  \nBut the lock was already undone, and I pushed the door open with my shoulder, grabbing my rifle from beside the doorframe to step into the misty night.\r  \nTwo of the aircraft landed, while another two continued to circle overhead, their door-gunners firing salvos of machine gun rounds into the woods around the church. A few dozen riflemen spread out in the ankle-high grass of the cemetery and advanced toward the church, their black rifles raised, with tubular night vision goggles pulled down over their eyes. Like the helicopters, the men were all clad in gray, a flat, slate gray that reminded me of stone, cold and unfeeling. I didn\u2019t see insignia anywhere, no letters, numbers, or patches for a unit. They moved with fluid, confident steps, as if this wasn\u2019t the first time they\u2019d been dropped into a dark, dangerous place, and cleared the surrounding church yard in a matter of minutes.\r  \nOne of the lead soldiers pointed to us, and they trotted our way with deliberate strides, their weapons never lowering. Cricket\u2019s hand tightened on mine, and I felt her tremble. She had yet to meet anyone else besides me, and this wasn\u2019t exactly a pleasant way to meet-and-greet.\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d I squeezed her hand back. \u201cJust let me talk to them.\u201d\r  \nShe didn\u2019t reply, merely nodded with her fearful golden irises trained on the soldiers.\r  \nThe nearest man stopped a few yards away and lowered his rifle. He swung the night vision goggles on his helmet back and grinned at me with a camouflage-painted face and shiny white teeth that gleamed between his bushy beard hairs like stars. \u201cHey there. You guys are a sight for sore eyes. We didn\u2019t think there was anyone left on this side of the ridge.\u201d\r  \n*Is it really that bad?*\r  \nI tried to stifle the unease that generated in my guts and smiled back pleasantly. \u201cGood to see you too. We\u2019ve been stuck here for days. You guys with the army?\u201d\r  \nHe winked at me, and his eyes travelled to where Cricket had ducked behind me. \u201cPrivate contracting company, actually. We\u2019re tasked with evacuating civilians from the danger zone. Is she okay?\u201d\r  \n\u201cShe\u2019s just really shy.\u201d I didn\u2019t step aside to expose her, as something about the way Cricket gripped the back of my shirt gave me pause. \u201cSo do you guys know what\u2019s going on out here?\u201d\r  \nSighing, the man slung his rifle over one shoulder, and muttered something into his radio mic before turning back to me. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated situation. Mind if we come in? We\u2019ll help you gather your things before we exfil out of here.\u201d\r  \nStepping to one side, I waved the soldiers in.\r  \nFive minutes later, we sat in the parsonage kitchen, our suitcases at our feet, and passed mugs of fresh coffee to the grateful troops. The man known as Lieutenant Bronson sipped his black-no-sugar across from Cricket and I, his angular face shaded and foreign in the kitchen light.\r  \n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t know how you two made it this long.\u201d He chuckled, and stretched to crack his back beneath the bulky plate carrier he wore. \u201cI\u2019ve seen whole squads of guys go out there and get torn up by those things, and they\u2019re not even the worst. Heard rumors from a gunship crew that they spotted something huge on radar, some kind of techno the size of a plane in the north woods. You\u2019re lucky that thing didn\u2019t settle down here.\u201d\r  \nCricket shifted in her chair and avoided the lieutenant\u2019s piercing gaze, picking at her jeans with a nervous fingernail. She didn\u2019t often get nervous, and I had to admit, it made me a little anxious to see her so on edge.\r  \nI glanced at her out of the corner of my eye but played it cool. \u201cWe just laid low, mostly. Couldn\u2019t leave after they slashed my car tires. So, where did all these things come from?\u201d\r  \nBronson made eye contact with one of the other soldiers around the room and scratched the back of his neck. \u201cLike I said, it\u2019s complicated. A bunch of scientific stuff that\u2019s above my paygrade. From what I\u2019ve been told, it\u2019s basically some form of electro-magnetic radiation that causes cellular life cycles to change. Makes mutants out of normal stuff and creates new things where holes in the environment exist. I figure you\u2019ve seen plenty of that, right?\u201d\r  \nAgain, he looked at Cricket, and something about the way he watched her, with a wary, predatory gaze, made my skin crawl.\r  \n*She\u2019s not going to bite you . . . or are you thinking of biting her?*\r  \nI scooted my chair closer to hers and slid my hand under the table to grip Cricket\u2019s, her fingers clammy on mine. \u201cYeah. We actually made lots of drawings, and notes. If you\u2019d like, we could show them to you.\u201d\r  \nBronson let slide a broad grin. \u201cIf your shy friend here wouldn\u2019t mind grabbing those for us, that would be excellent.\u201d\r  \nTurning to Cricket, I nodded toward the door, and leaned to whisper in her hear. \u201cWhen you go to get the drawings, count how many soldiers there are. Just so we know, okay?\u201d\r  \nHer face hardened into a knowing, resolute impassiveness, and Cricket rose to slip down the dimly lit hallway.\r  \n\u201cNever did catch your name.\u201d Finished with his coffee, Bronson leaned back in his chair, and I saw some of the former smile fade, the mask falling away to reveal his calculating eyes on me.\r  \n\u201cAdam.\u201d I cleared my throat and tried to find a way to sit that didn\u2019t make me feel surrounded by the heavily armed squad in my kitchen. \u201cAdam Stirling.\u201d\r  \n\u201cAnd her name?\u201d\r  \nA long, heavy silence fell between us, and I couldn\u2019t look away from the lieutenant\u2019s hard eyes, my pulse roaring.\r  \n*I shouldn\u2019t tell him. Not yet.*\r  \n\u201cStacy.\u201d It tasted bitter in my mouth, but I spat the lie out, draining the last of my coffee to hide my grimace. \u201cShe\u2019s my wife.\u201d\r  \nHe raised a dark eyebrow and Bronson drummed his fingers on the table. \u201cHmm. She\u2019s pretty. Never seen eyes like that though. Solid gold. Kind of strange, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\r  \nShrugging, I tried to keep my palms dry by rubbing them on my pant legs. \u201cIt\u2019s a medical condition. She\u2019s had it since she was born.\u201d\r  \n\u201cReally?\u201d Bronson dropped the friendliness completely and wove both fingers together under his bearded chin. \u201cWhen was that, precisely?\u201d\r  \n*This guy is really getting on my nerves.*\r  \n\u201cWhy?\u201d I narrowed my eyes at him and crossed both arms.\r  \nHe cocked his head to one side, and his lips tugged into a smirk. \u201cCareful with that tone, Stirling. After all, we\u2019re your ride out of here.\u201d\r  \n\u201cAnd if we choose to stay?\u201d The retort left my mouth before I could stop it, my angst getting the better of me. \u201cI appreciate the Seal-Team-Six rescue, but like I said, we\u2019ve been just fine up till now. You\u2019re in my kitchen, Lieutenant. Don\u2019t forget that.\u201d\r  \nTension clouded the air, thick as mud, and no one sipped their coffee now. Behind their face paint, the men glared at me, and more than one flexed their grip on their weapons.\r  \n*Where is Cricket? How long does it take to get a notepad from the next room?*\r  \n\u201cYou know, Stirling, I ran into guys like you a lot when I was just a grunt.\u201d Bronson chuckled, a humorless, warning laugh that sent shivers down my spinal cord. \u201cBig tough talkers, up until the truth hit them in the face. Then they\u2019d show themselves for the lying rats they were. I hate liars, Stirling. Hate them. So . . . you want some truth?\u201d\r  \nI couldn\u2019t tell if it was a threat, a challenge, or an offer. But either way, all I wanted was to find Cricket, and get away from these men as soon as possible. \u201cI want to leave now, please.\u201d\r  \nOblivious to my demands, the lieutenant leaned across the table, and I could smell the chewing tobacco on his breath. \u201cThe truth is, you\u2019re a damned liar. Your wife died last year, in a car wreck. You came here alone. We\u2019ve had a drone watching you, every time you walked through that door. We saw everything.\u201d\r  \nMy throat turned bone-dry, and I became acutely aware of how far my antiquated Winchester was from my hands, and how long it would take me to reach where it stood, propped in the corner.\r  \n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I gritted my teeth, doing my best to keep my calm, even as my brain screamed that Cricket had been gone for far too long.\r  \nBronson didn\u2019t move, only watched me with that snake-like stare that showed no remorse whatsoever. \u201cThe truth. We\u2019ve been dealing with the freaks for months now, trying to find a cure. Drugs, kemo, you name it, we tried it. Even exposure to sunlight. Nothing. All dead in minutes. And yet, somehow, you find a way to change one with a garden shed and shovel . . . and she\u2019s thriving.\u201d\r  \nHorror iced through me, and I clawed for something to rescue me, a convincing lie, a bluff, but nothing came. The clock ticked in the background, I could smell the musty coffee pot burning, and outside, the helicopters whirled over head in a deadly, throbbing rhythm.\r  \nA muffled scream cut through the tension from just down the hall, and a thud echoed in the shadows.\r  \n*Cricket.*\r  \nI lunged for the hallway, but hands grabbed me from all sides, and one of the soldiers snatched my Winchester before I could reach for it.\r  \nSomeone slammed a fist into my stomach, and all the air rushed from my lungs. I crumpled, my knees buckling, and they pinned both arms behind my back.\r  \nTwo more soldiers emerged from down the hall, and between them Cricket writhed, her hair a wild mess, feet kicking at the air, one of her shoes missing.\r  \n\u201cAdam!\u201d Her golden eyes filled with tears, and she thrashed to free her trapped arms, too small to overpower the hulking mercenaries.\r  \nStruggling to stand, I managed to drive my head into the side of the closest man, only to have stars explode before my eyes when my skull hit his steel plate armor. \u201cGet your hands off her!\u201d\r  \nAgain, more fists collided with my head, face, and chest, until darkness nibbled at the corners of my vision. Pain rolled through me, I\u2019d never been hit so hard in my life, and red blood dripped from my nose onto the floor.\r  \n\u201cStop it!\u201d Cricket wailed, her sobs choked and uncontrollable. \u201cStop it, please! Don\u2019t hurt him!\u201d\r  \nBronson strode casually, and knelt so his face was level with mine. \u201cI just need a simple answer, Stirling. How? How did you do it?\u201d\r  \n\u201cS-Sunlight.\u201d I coughed, the metallic, coppery blood bubbling over my cracked lip. \u201cThe sun it . . . it changed her. I swear.\u201d\r  \n\u201cWhat did I say about the lying?\u201d The lieutenant shook his head and waved to the men surrounding Cricket. \u201cHold her down.\u201d\r  \n\u201cNo!\u201d I threw myself at him but made it only a few inches before black tactical boots slammed into my ribs in a cascade of misery.\r  \nCricket flailed, but they dragged her to the floor, and pinned all four limbs. One of the men held her head in place, and Bronson reached into the small pouch on his side to retrieve a strange, silver-colored gun, with two thin metal needles on the end.\r  \nHe knelt by her head, and Cricket\u2019s pleading eyes met mine as they pulled her blonde hair back, the tip of the needle pressing against her scalp.\r  \nLieutenant Bronson pulled the trigger, and Cricket screamed in agony, her eyes screwed shut, every muscle in her body going rigid. An electrical snapping, like that of a tazer hummed, and my vision-tinged red.\r  \nBeep-Beep.\r  \nWithdrawing the gun, Bronson wiped the blood-stained prongs on his pant cuff, and looked down at a little blue screen on the back of the gun.\r  \nHis grin brightened, and the lieutenant clicked the black plastic hand mic on his plate carrier. \u201cBase, this is Harvester One-Actual. I\u2019ve got a confirmed Type 6, viable female, condition alpha. I say again, I have a live, viable Type 6.\u201d\r  \nA sniffle came from the floor, and Cricket opened her eyes to fixate one me, rivers of pain swimming down her sweet face. I was helpless, we both were, and I\u2019d never felt more enraged, and humiliated in all my life.\r  \n*\u201cSolid copy Harvester One-Actual, you now have Priority Ultra flight status to the green zone. Secure the specimen, wipe the scene, and move to extract. Base out.\u201d*\r  \n\u201cNeutralize him and raze the building.\u201d Lieutenant Bronson jabbed a finger at me, and the other men hauled Cricket to her feet, the red blood dripping down her neck from the two holes in her pale skin. \u201cWe\u2019re wheel\u2019s up in five mikes.\u201d\r  \n*I have to do something. Adonai, please, I have to do something, help me.*\r  \nMy mind whirled . . . and an idea clicked into place.\r  \nLetting my eyes slide shut, I sagged, and went limp in my captors\u2019 arms.\r  \n\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d Bronson scoffed, and his knobby boots scuffed on the hardwood floor to leave. \u201cTough guys, all of them, right up until the action starts. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\r  \nThe soldiers standing over me relaxed, and one of them took his hand off my arm, either to readjust his grip, or scratch at his face.\r  \n*Wrong move loser.*\r  \nI reached back, and my fingers closed over the smooth, textured handle of something stuck in his waist belt.\r  \nSteel flashed in the hallway light, and the man to my left howled as I buried the blade in his face. The one on my right scrabbled to grab his knife away from me, but I drove my elbow back into his chin, and threw myself backward to tumble over him in a clumsy reverse-somersault on the kitchen floor.\r  \nLanding on my face, I crawled back into the fight, too panicked and desperate to think about how bad this would end for me and wrapped my arm around the man\u2019s neck. More of the soldiers ran to help their comrade, guns raised, but my hand found the automatic pistol on the mercenary\u2019s belt, and I jerked it free.\r  \n\u201cGet back.\u201d I pressed the gun to the man\u2019s sweaty temple and thumbed off the safety. \u201cEveryone back, or he\u2019s a dead man.\u201d\r  \nBronson froze, his face a mask of surprise, and irritation. The men carrying Cricket stopped as well, and Cricket\u2019s wide eyes switched back and forth the between me, and the lieutenant. Somehow, my crazy gamble had paid off, though I hadn\u2019t expected to get this far.\r  \n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Bronson rolled his eyes at me. \u201cThat\u2019s your master plan? I\u2019ve got forty guys ringing this place with steel, you won\u2019t get\u2014\u201d\r  \n\u201cShut up.\u201d I hissed and tightened my grip on the pistol enough that Bronson\u2019s face drained of some color. \u201cLet her go.\u201d\r  \nNo one moved, the tense soldier who I held captive looked pleadingly at Bronson, the wounded mercenary at my feet groaned in pain from the knife still embedded in his face, and the radios crackled with muffled voices in the background.\r  \n\u201cOr what?\u201d Bronson\u2019s snide grin returned, and he jerked his head at Cricket. \u201cYou shoot him, we shoot you, she still goes with us. You really don\u2019t understand \u2018deterrence\u2019 do you?\u201d\r  \n*I\u2019m not letting you take her.*\r  \n\u201cShe stays with me.\u201d I growled and pressed the muzzle of the gun to the skin of the soldier I clung to. \u201cI won\u2019t miss, not from this close. Let her go, now.\u201d\r  \nFor a moment, we stood there, the mercenary staring into my eyes, while I stared right back. A few weeks ago, holding a soldier at gunpoint would have sounded crazy to me, but now something primal surged in my blood, an animalistic rage that purged me of the reasonable meekness from modern world I\u2019d left behind. This was our home, Cricket belonged with me, and I knew then that I\u2019d rather throw myself mindlessly into machine gun fire than let them cart her off.\r  \n\u201cYou know what?\u201d Bronson hissed, and his hand inched for the gun on his belt. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will.\u201d\r  \nMy eyes drifted to Cricket one last time, and she stared back at me, her beautiful face tear stained and forlorn. Man, she was pretty, like a bright spring day with cotton-ball clouds and fresh wildflowers. I was going to miss her. I was going to miss a lot of things.\r  \n*I\u2019m sorry.*\r  \nI wanted to say more, wanted her to know so much more about the world, about me, about how I felt about her, but my time was up. The journey ended here, in this hallway, with me spattered over the ground like a dead mosquito. A worthy end, though. A man\u2019s end. One Stacy would have been proud of.\r  \n\u201cAdam.\u201d\r  \nThe soft, wavering voice jerked me into the present.\r  \nCricket\u2019s shut her eyes and breathed in deep. \u201cRun.\u201d\r  \nHer mouth opened, and a low, raspy note came out, building higher and higher.\r  \nIt rose into a piercing, eerie screech that bored into my ears with a siren frequency, painful and shrill. In my mind\u2019s eye, I saw again the dirty, white-eyed fiend on the first day staring into the mirror, screaming at her own reflection. Harsh static rushed through my brain, my memories rippled before my eyes, and for a brief second, I saw the drawing Cricket had made on the shed floor, with the strange, towering figure whose head was made of branches.\r  \nGlass shattered. Men cried out in torment. The radios flared with garbled voices.\r  \nI dropped the pistol and clapped both hands over my ears, my skull aching at the sound. But even from beneath my wall of fingers, I still caught the thudding of feet on the grass just outside, the roar of hundreds of throaty calls in unison, and the echoes of gunfire picking up.\r  \nCricket\u2019s scream cut out, and I blinked to find myself outstretched on the kitchen floor, the world spinning, my head a mess of fog. Bronson and the other soldiers lay slumped in the hallway, either unconscious or dead, I didn\u2019t know. But their radios shouted with panic, the other soldiers outside in total bedlam.\r  \n\u201cContact, contact in the trees!\u201d\r  \n\u201cThey\u2019re everywhere!\u201d\r  \n\u201cBase, this is Echo Three-Five, we\u2019re under heavy attack at sector nine, we need\u2014\u201d\r  \nSnarls cut him off, and the howls of the Lost Ones blazed through the night air in triumph. I could smell the blood on the wind, knew it wasn\u2019t just my broken nose, the shrieks of dying mercenaries accompanied by the awful rending of flesh and snapping of bones like tree branches. Machine gun fire roared overhead, but it didn\u2019t help, as more rabid limbs scuttled over the grass just beyond the kitchen wall, hundreds of mouths eager for the first fresh meat they\u2019d had in days.\r  \nHands snatched at the cloth of my T-shirt, but I was too weak to fight. They dragged me over the floor, toward the back door of the kitchen, and into the cool, damp, shadows. My vision blurred and all four limbs seemed heavy as lead. But there was something else, something just on the end of my perception, so quiet I almost didn\u2019t notice it.\r  \nWhispers. Whispers echoed everywhere, in the corners of my mind, in the grass under my back, in the thin white mist that hung on the air.\r  \n*Lost, lost, lost.*\r  \nStiff twigs scratched at my body, and leaves fell around my face. Green closed over me, and I recognized on of the bushes on the side of the parsonage, a small bird\u2019s nest in the limbs just over my head. Gooey Ohio clay squelched under my back, cold against the already soaked shirt I wore, and I smelled churned earth, hot blood, and burned gunpowder.\r  \nA shadow loomed over me in the tiny cavern of the shrub, and I stiffened, waited for the pain, the squared wooden teeth tearing into my flesh.\r  \nTender fingers slid over my face, probed gently at my bleeding nose and swollen right eye. \u201cAdam? Adam, please say something. Please don\u2019t be dead.\u201d\r  \n*Oh, thank you, Adonai.*\r  \nHer voice broke me, and I choked out a sob. \u201cCricket? Is that you?\u201d\r  \n\u201cYes.\u201d She sniffled, her soft golden hair brushing my face, and even in the dark, I could tell she was trying to make a brave smile. \u201cYes, I\u2019m here.\u201d\r  \nHer fingers wove into mine, and I gripped her hand with all my might. \u201cDid they hurt you? Your head . . .\u201d\r  \nCricket huddled low over me as if to shield me from the sight of the dozens of feet scuttling by us, her golden eyes almost glowing in the dim light of the stars. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Oh, your poor face . . .\u201d\r  \n\u201cWas never my best feature anyway.\u201d I pulled her close to me, the two of us covered in mud and blood, hidden under the shrubs while the war raged just on the other side of the greenery.\r  \nFingernails and toenails clawed at the threshold of the kitchen door that stood open. From my hiding place, I fought a wave of nausea at the sound of the men inside awakening to the teeth and claws of the Lost Ones. Bones crunched, flesh tore, blood splattered like a hose, and I had a feeling that I wouldn\u2019t be seeing Lieutenant Bronson again.\r  \nNot in one piece, anyway.\r  \nOverhead, the helicopters soared away, only three left now, and from the hammering of bare fists on metal, I figured the other would never make it into the sky. But my stomach sank, as I realized that we were worse off than before. Our fortress was breached, we were exposed, unarmed, and surrounded by hundreds of the Lost Ones. There was no escape now.\r  \nClosing my eyes, I held Cricket to my chest, breathed in the smell of her hair, and kissed her forehead. \u201cWhatever happens . . . I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d\r  \nShe clung to me, so tight my bruised ribs ached. \u201cMe too.\u201d\r  \nLoud, horrific screeches sliced through the air, followed by more, in a wave of ethereal misery.\r  \nSomething in my head locked onto that sound, and my eyes flew open to meet Cricket\u2019s, her own mouth hanging open in shock. I knew that sound. I\u2019d heard it once before.\r  \nTurning my sore neck, I squinted in surprise.\r  \nA thin tendril of warm yellow light poked through the leaves of the bushes around us. More came, inch by inch, pouring over the sky, and the screams dropped off to eerie silence.\r  \n*Dawn.*\r  \n\u201cDo you think . . ?\u201d Cricket whispered, still shaking in my embrace.\r  \nSwallowing a coppery lump in my throat, I rolled onto my stomach, and pulled myself over the mud. \u201cStay close to me.\u201d\r  \nCrawling out of that bush, I stepped into the blaze of colors that painted the morning sky, a kaleidoscope of red, orange, pink and yellow. All over the yard, in the tree line, surrounding the tombstones in the cemetery, and heaped up in mounds around the mutilated helicopter were dozens upon dozens of blackened figures, frozen in the moment the sun had caught them in the open. No guns rang out, as gray-uniformed bodies lay scattered and broken, their flesh torn and shredded like blended fruit. The formerly white walls of the church were stained claret red from the slaughter, and spent brass casings littered the green grass.\r  \n*Over. It\u2019s over.*\r  \n\u201cThey\u2019re gone.\u201d I turned to gaze deep into Cricket\u2019s beautiful golden eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re all gone.\u201d\r  \nA giggle rose in my throat, as it did in hers, and we wrapped our arms around each other, too weak and happy to think. The birds in the trees began their morning song, a few Bone-Faced Whitetail stepped cautiously out onto the green, and a honeybee buzzed past my face. Warmth kissed my skin, and I\u2019d never felt so good, standing in the sunlight.\r  \nCricket\u2019s breath tickled my neck and sent fire through my blood. \u201cThank you.\u201d\r  \n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d I brushed some of her golden hair from her face, relishing the way Cricket tinged pink at my touch. \u201cYou belong here. It\u2019s not home without you.\u201d\r  \nShe pressed her satin lips to my cheek, and I was suddenly aware of her every curve, how even covered in mud, blood, and leaves, she still looked gorgeous.\r  \n\u201cAdam?\u201d\r  \n\u201cHmm?\u201d It was my turn to flush with embarrassment, though Cricket didn\u2019t seem to mind my staring.\r  \nShe pulled back to search my face, her expression timid, and yet hopeful. \u201cI, um . . . I just . . . I need to know something.\u201d\r  \n\u201cAnything.\u201d I breathed, my heart skipping a beat at the way her hand rested on my chest.\r  \nShe swallowed hard, and met my eye, her voice wavering with uncertainty. \u201cWho am I to you?\u201d\r  \nLike it had been touched with a live wire, my heart twitched, and a warmth flooded through me that hadn\u2019t been there in months. In that instant, the words rang through my mind.\r  \n*My ways are not your ways, my thoughts are not your thoughts sayeth the Lord.*\r  \nThe soldiers were gone. The Lost Ones were now frozen in their cocoons all around us, ready to break free in several hours\u2019 time. My empty church would be full, almost to bursting, with new people. People who could survive this strange new world, who could sense the animals around them, and avoid the dangers and pitfalls far better than the rest of us. And they would be welcomed here, in God\u2019s house.\r  \nWelcomed as family.\r  \nPeering into her luminescent eyes, I smiled, and allowed myself to feel the one emotion I\u2019d shut out ever since I lost Stacy to that runaway semi-truck.\r  \n\u201cEve.\u201d I breathed, with all the love in my heart. \u201cYour name is Eve.\u201d",

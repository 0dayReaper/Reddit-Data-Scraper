    "postText": "She called it *Yoga for One*.\n\nI found her stream a month ago, during a rare confluence of self-disdain and spare time that collided into something resembling motivation. Tucked between the kickboxing classes and the home-gym meatheads was her thumbnail.\n\nIt caught my eye. It was a simple shot of her face, so near to the camera that I could count the freckles. Her teeth a little too large for her mouth and her nose ever so slightly crooked.\n\nI\u2019ve never been the type of guy to consider yoga, but I tuned in, and in a matter of seconds, I was entranced.\n\nThe girl was in her living room, a haphazard mise-en-scene \u2013 the floor speckled with sad little plants and stacks of magazines. She posed with her hands on the floor and her hips thrust in the air. Her butt perched in the center of the screen.\n\nI decided to stay a while.\n\nI had no yoga mat, so I laid out a towel. It was difficult to follow along \u2013 she talked, a *lot*, and only a fraction of it was about the routine. \u201cPress your heels together and bend your head to your feet, breathing deeply. My feet smell like peaches and cream today. Makes me want to gobble them up. I love summer peaches, I love biting into them and feeling the juice erupt in my mouth, it reminds me of the time when \u2013 \u201d\n\nAnd I fell into the meditative quagmire woven by her words, inhaling the scent of my own socks, failing to notice she\u2019d moved into a different pose.\n\nAfter a while, my muscles trembled with the effort of supporting my soft body in these unfamiliar positions, so I called it a day. It was then that I noticed it.\n\n*Subscribers: 1*\n\nThat was me. I was the only one watching. I felt an inexplicable flood of guilt when I closed the browser, like I was abandoning her.\n\nI checked back into her channel the next few afternoons. It was the strangest thing. She was *always* streaming. She was either unaware of my presence, or apathetic to it. Her ramblings, so freewheeling that they approached random word association, didn\u2019t seem to change whether I was there or not \u2013 she was often mid-sentence when I logged in. She was flirty in a way that made it clear she wasn\u2019t trying to be, charmingly raw in her tendency to fumble instructions.\n\nCuriosity overwhelmed me. I yearned to discover more about this fascinating creature. Her movements drew me in, like she was grasping at me through the screen. I marveled at the feeling of being her silent voyeur.\n\nI developed more comfort with the basic poses, though I still couldn\u2019t get my hands anywhere near my toes. Too soon, she notched up the level of difficulty. She eased herself into the splits. Each leg outstretched, her toes pointed at perfect right angles. I tried my best to replicate the pose, my groin protesting the pressure. Each day, she pushed a little farther. She curved her spine sharply behind her, a graceful arc. She lifted her back leg high into the air at an angle that seemed to wrench her hip out of place.\n\nI forced my body into the closest approximations of her geometry that my tendons would allow, my teeth gritted against the sharp warnings issued by my nerves. At night I dreamed that she was breaking my joints, cracking my limbs into the clean shapes that she maintained so effortlessly.\n\nOne day she twisted her arms so far behind her that I felt sympathetic pain, and folded herself up so that her bent legs swooped around her shoulders, touching her toes behind her neck. She smiled at the camera, demurely, politely. \u201cYou want to see me bend into a pretzel, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.\n\nThat was the first time she addressed me.\n\nI would forget to eat. I\u2019d wake up on the couch, having dozed off, and she would be murmuring about pomegranates while her forehead brushed her knees. Did she sleep? Did she eat? I saw no evidence of it.\n\nEvery time I moved, my body ached with the memory of being stretched to its limit. I was spending ten, twelve, fourteen hours a day on her stream. She spoke to me frequently. \u201cI know you\u2019ve been watching me. I think you like watching me. How far do you want me to twist for you?\u201d\n\nThe fluid shifting of her body into vertices and curves and delicate polygons was hypnotizing. I was getting lost in the light of a flickering flame as it swirled into different patterns. I was working myself into something more pliable, molding myself into something like her image.\n\nIt's difficult to pinpoint the moment she went too far. It was more like the creep of quicksand than any one single point.\n\nShe would lie on her back and lift herself on the palms and soles of her feet, her torso thrusting at the ceiling like she was something from the Exorcist. She would inch her hands and feet closer together, folding her body backwards on itself until she was nearly split in half. And then she would skitter forward until the whites of her eyes flooded the screen, scaring me so much that I jumped. And she would laugh, as if she had made a joke.\n\nShe would twist her head around like an owl, and thrust it between her thighs. Always blinking at the screen. Always smiling like we were sharing some inside secret, like I was in on the sly conspiracy.\n\nShe said, \u201cYou like this, don\u2019t you, Mr. Smith? Am I your foldable pocket toy?\u201d\n\nSmith is a very common last name. There was a nonzero chance she\u2019d just guessed correctly. But this freaked me out enough to slam the laptop shut, shattering the image of her toothy smile.\n\nI tried to resume normal life. But I had almost nothing to fill my time except television and social media and filling out applications for jobs I\u2019d never want to work. A strange sensation tickled at me, like something was wrong, like I was forgetting something. And powerful waves of guilt, the same guilt I\u2019d felt when I closed her stream the first day I\u2019d found her.\n\nI tried not to. I really, really tried to stay away. But the urge overwhelmed me, so I returned.\n\nFor the first time, she wasn\u2019t onscreen when I logged in. I peered closer at the scene, seeing the familiar yoga mat on the ground, the coffee table, the magazines. There was a soft noise coming from just off-screen, a muffled noise, irregular and halting. A human voice. I turned the volume all the way up, and I couldn\u2019t tell if it was laughter or crying.\n\nFeeling sick, I closed the stream.\n\nThis brings us to yesterday.\n\nI had spent countless hours thinking about her, wondering what she was doing, whether she was still telling stories to her invisible visitor. I logged in.\n\nHer eyes filled the webcam\u2019s field of vision, so suddenly that I scrambled backwards. And that sound \u2013 echoing around the walls of her apartment and mine, and it was now clear that it was a sound of misery.\n\nHer moan was wordless, and as her face backed away, I saw why. Her bare foot was stuffed halfway in her mouth, her jaw nearly unhinged to accommodate it, the ball wedged between her teeth. Tears were streaming down her face, pooling around the corners of her stretched lips.\n\nHer arms were folded behind her head and her other leg was tucked under the first. She was struggling, and I realized that she was stuck.\n\nShe was trapped in that position, a twisted ball of limbs and strained joints, unable to speak.\n\nI stared slackjawed at the screen, and her eyes met mine, seeming to blink in recognition. The force of her sobs crescendoed. In relief? I wasn\u2019t sure.\n\nI had no idea what to do. I didn\u2019t know her name or where she lived \u2013 I didn\u2019t even know for sure that she was in the same country. I sat, frozen, for long moments, watching the twitching of her limbs as she tried to wrench herself out of the cage her body made. Then it struck me: I could type.\n\n*Can you type your address?*\n\nThe messaged pinged its arrival at her computer. Our first real communication.\n\nShe shook her head almost imperceptibly, with the slight range of motion her position allowed.\n\nI tried again: *Can you type with your nose?*\n\nHer eyes flickered across the page as she read my words. With great effort she rocked herself over, landing face-first on the keyboard. *sivioshgeusoh*, she typed.\n\nMy heart pounding, I said, *try again*.\n\nI watched as she managed to prop herself precariously on one shoulder. Her body was convulsing with the force of her sobs. Eventually, she leaned forward, carefully, delicately, and pressed the tip of her nose to the keys. *3*.\n\nYes! That was it! *That\u2019s great. Give me another number.*\n\nWe traded for long, suspenseful minutes, her giving me one number or letter at a time, me writing them down and encouraging her as best I could. *You\u2019re doing great. I\u2019m here with you. Help is on the way.*\n\nShe had cobbled together a number and a street. It had taken us nearly an hour to get to this point. She had just finished typing *apt12* when she stopped, trembling with the effort of keeping herself upright, and we met eyes again through the camera, hers shining with pain and fear. And then she collapsed.\n\nShe rolled out of sight. Panicking, I sent her dozens of frantic messages: *What city? What state? Stay with me. I\u2019m here. Where are you? I need more.*\n\nIt became clear that no more was coming. Her sobs stilled, her breath quieted.\n\nI searched the address and found every city in the country where the address she\u2019d given me existed. I called every police station in every jurisdiction within range. It took a *lot* of explanation, but after hours of work there was nothing I could do but sit and wait nervously by the phone and stare at the empty apartment framed within my laptop screen.\n\nAll I could do was type.\n\n*I\u2019m here with you.*\n\n*You\u2019ll be safe.*\n\n*This will be over soon.*\n\n*You\u2019re not alone.*\n\nThe ringing of the phone nearly sent me out of my skin. It was one in the morning.\n\n\u201cDid you find her?\u201d I asked desperately, scanning the scene for any sign of activity. \u201cTell me she\u2019s all right!\u201d\n\nThe voice on the other end of the line sighed, a deep sigh, of sadness or frustration I couldn\u2019t say. \u201cWe found her,\u201d he said, his words gentle but guarded. \u201cStuck in that position, as you described. She\u2019s\u2026 she\u2019s not okay. She died of dehydration.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe \u2013 what? No. That\u2019s not possible. I just spoke to her!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you saw, son. I truly don\u2019t. But the girl we found has been dead for a month.\u201d\n\n[*x*](https://www.reddit.com/r/relicularity/)",

Too bad they never met. :(\n\nThe story isn't 100% clear but it's enough to dot the images together even if it doesn't give a full on picture--it's better that way.

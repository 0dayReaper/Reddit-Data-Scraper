    "postText": "\r\n\nThe drive through this part of Nevada was beautiful. The tall cliffs were lined by majestic pines while the road leisurely wound through the scenery. But no matter how amazing the view was, it couldn\u2019t change the fact that I was out here to deal with something incredibly unpleasant.   \n\n\nMy brother Jason worked as a park ranger until he suddenly went missing one night. No one knows exactly what happened. From all appearances, he seemed to have gotten up from the ranger station to check on something routine and never came back. There was an extensive search, but nothing turned up. The ranger station had been found exactly as it should be, there were no signs of a struggle, no strange tire tracks or footprints leading away from the park, and no eyewitnesses who reported seeing Jason anywhere after that. So here I was, trying to do what everyone in my family wanted me to do and see if I could find anything. Was I optimistic? Not really. But stranger things have happened in life. All I knew was that I was here to look around, and that was what I was going to do.   \n\n\nIt was late afternoon by the time I arrived at my destination. The town the park was located by was as average as could be. A main street lined with a variety of shops and stores, and residential areas that branched off it. A place you\u2019ve seen on a thousand brochures and postcards.  \n\n\nI parked in front of the local pizza restaurant. Not only was I hungry, this would be a great opportunity to see what people around here were like. If they were open and welcoming, especially if I mentioned my brother, I\u2019d know what I was dealing with. If not, that meant something was up, and I would get out of there as quickly as possible.   \n\n\nThe pizza place had a few customers this time of day, so I got right in at a table in the middle of the restaurant. I decided on a medium pepperoni pizza and relaxed in my seat while sipping my water. Once I was done eating my pizza, which was very good, I paid the bill and left a generous tip and headed to the park my brother had worked at for two years until he vanished one night.   \n\n\nThe park looked like any other I\u2019d seen. Well maintained, neat, and orderly. The kind of place you\u2019d like to have a picnic in. But of course, nature is like anything else; what you see on the surface is only a fraction of what is really going on.   \n\n\nI drove up the neatly landscaped driveway and parked in front of the ranger station. My shoes crunched on the gravel as I got out of the car and approached the building. I was expecting an old rustic cabin, but this ranger station was relatively modern, with large bay windows and a gleaming metal fa\u00e7ade. I approached the front door, knocked, and waited. A moment later, it opened and a man in a ranger uniform looked at me.   \n\n\n\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d he asked.   \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Alex, Jason\u2019s brother. I\u2019m here for some information.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cOh I see. Come right in.\u201d   \n\n\nThe ranger held the door open and pointed to a sitting area.  \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll let the boss know you\u2019re here. Can I get you something to drink?\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine thank you.\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cAlright. We\u2019ll be right with you.\u201d   \n\n\nAnd with that, the ranger hustled down the hallway and I was left alone. I hadn\u2019t given anyone a heads up I was coming. I didn\u2019t want anyone to prepare for my arrival. My brother had gone missing several weeks ago. It was just a question of why. I don\u2019t believe he just ran off for no reason, so that meant there had to be a reason why. And everyone, me included, wanted to know what that was. Since he went missing at work, it seemed obvious to be work related, but it was entirely possible that it was connected to something else. It could\u2019ve been something he encountered while at work but had nothing to do with the job itself.   \n\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve never been a huge fan of camping or anything like that. I certainly appreciate nature, but I\u2019m definitely more of the stay inside and read a book type. Jason was always much more enthusiastic about the outdoors, and it wasn\u2019t a surprise to anyone when he became a park ranger. Just like it was no surprise to anyone when I became an architect. And here we were.   \n\n\nAt that moment, an older man who was also in a ranger uniform came out and faced me.   \n\n\n\u201cAlex?\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Tim. Park manager.\u201d   \n\n\nHe shook my hand firmly.   \n\n\n\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d I said.   \n\n\n\u201cLikewise. Jason was a good ranger and we all liked him. So if I can be of any help, don\u2019t hesitate to ask.\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cI appreciate that. And what I need now is information.\u201d  \n\n\nTim nodded. \u201cOf course. Why don\u2019t you follow me to my office.\u201d   \n\n\nHe led the way to his office, a small room with a neat view of the park entrance. Once I sat down in a chair facing his desk, and he leaned back in his desk chair, we started talking again.  \n\n\n\u201cI would love to say we have new information for you, but we don\u2019t. And it bothers me. We\u2019ve never had an incident like this in the history of this park.\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cThe only other thing I can think to add is that about a week or so after he vanished, I was out on my route checking on things, and I could feel someone watching me. Just for a moment, but it was there. And I had no idea who was responsible. Because when I looked around, I didn\u2019t see anyone.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cInteresting.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cDo you mind if I ask you a question?\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cWhat do you think happened to your brother?\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought about that a million times. The honest answer is I don\u2019t know. But I don\u2019t believe he just ran off. That isn\u2019t Jason.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fair. And for what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t believe it either.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cAlright. Now it\u2019s my turn to ask you something. What are the odds that something happened to Jason out here?\u201d   \n\n\nTim paused as he considered my question. \u201cSomewhat possible. I\u2019ve always liked working here, but the woods are the woods. And things happen out there.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cNo doubt. Ok. The next logical step is to think that if something happened in the woods, where exactly was it most likely? Are there any locations around here something odd tends to happen at? Places people tend to steer clear of if they can avoid it? It doesn\u2019t have to be in the park, but around town.\u201d   \n\n\nTim  chuckled. \u201cOh that would be the old quarry. No doubt about it. Or more exactly, what\u2019s left of the old quarry. You know mining used to be the big industry out here?\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cI do. What\u2019s happened at the old quarry?\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cThat I know of? The usual things people would prefer to forget. And that\u2019s just what we know of.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cCan you point me towards it?\u201d   \n\n\nTim stood up from his desk. \u201cI can do better than that. I can show you where it is.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cGreat.\u201d   \n\n\nTim led the way in his truck, and we were there in 15 minutes. We parked on a small cliff overlooking the quarry itself, which was now filled with water. A group of five people were sitting further down on the cliff, and they glanced at the two of us with slight interest when they saw our cars pull up. When we got out of our vehicles, we briefly glanced at each other, and Tim gave me a slight nod of encouragement. Then I stepped forward.   \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for some information. My brother\u2019s gone missing. He was a park ranger. If you can help, you\u2019ll be compensated for it.\u201d  \n\n\nThen I took out my phone, pulled up a picture of Jason, and held it up so they could see it. The group all looked at the photo for a second. After a moment, I saw one of the guys do a double take.   \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen him,\u201d the guy nodded. \u201cLess than a month ago.\u201d   \n\n\nI got chills as he said this, because that would be right about the time Jason went missing.   \n\u201cWhere was he?\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cThe Wistful Pines Inn.\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hotel about an hour away,\u201d Tim said.   \n\n\n\u201cWhat was he doing?\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cNothing in particular. Just hanging around near the road from what I could tell. But from the look in his eyes, he seemed very focused on something.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cThank you for your help.\u201d I reached in my pocket and gave him a 100-dollar bill. Then Tim and I headed for the Wistful Pines Inn. It was your typical roadside motel with two stories and a swimming pool in front. There was also a small sign advertising where the front office was, so I headed there while Tim stayed in his truck. Standing at the front desk was an older woman with long silver hair.   \n\n\n\u201cHello, how can I help you?\u201d She asked politely.   \n\n\n\u201cMy brother went missing in the area about a month ago, and I was wondering if maybe you\u2019d seen him here?\u201d   \n\n\nThen I showed her the photo. There were no signs she\u2019d ever seen him before.  \n\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t recall seeing him here.\u201d   \n\n\nI put my phone away. \u201cThank you.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t here. Just that I didn\u2019t see him. What was his name?\u201d  \n\n\nI gave her Jason\u2019s full name, and she deftly typed it into the computer in front of her and paused for a moment.   \n\n\n\u201cNope. Nothing in our records either. We don\u2019t have security cameras, so there\u2019s nothing to check there I\u2019m afraid.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cI really appreciate your help. It was a long shot anyways. A tip.\u201d  \n\n\nShe nodded. \u201cI see. Well your tip may be right after all. Because strictly between us.\u201d Her voice lowered a bit. \u201cA film crew was staying here for about a week while they were in the area to film part of a documentary. They haven\u2019t been seen since the night before last.\u201d   \n\n\nThe idea settled in the air uneasily as she pressed a few buttons on the computer before turning the screen so I could see it. On it was a local news article about the film crew who was in town to do a piece about abandoned mines. The film crew all looked to be close to me in age, and by all appearances they seemed happy and content.   \n\n\n\u201cThanks for telling me.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cSure. I have no idea what happened, but good luck with finding your brother. Come back if you need anything else.\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d   \n\n\nThen I left the office and told Tim what I found out. He sat there quietly for a moment before he started talking.   \n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve dealt with a lot of people wanting to get footage of this or that over the years. It\u2019s amazing really. How nature can be dangerous enough when you know what you\u2019re doing and have tons of experience.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cNo doubt. Is it possible that they disappeared not just because they were filming, but because of what they were filming?\u201d   \n\n\nTim considered it for a moment. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cJust a thought.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cNo, I get it. It\u2019s a valid question. We have no idea what they were filming, but we can always double check. It\u2019s certainly possible that they were filming something completely routine and stumbled onto something they didn\u2019t intend to.\u201d  \n\n\nI shivered slightly at the thought. One person going missing could have many explanations. Two going missing doesn\u2019t have as many possibilities, but a number of scenarios could have happened depending on the circumstances. But a group? That\u2019s inherently unsettling because it strongly suggests something bad happened. But with nothing left to go on, I had no choice but to call it a day. \n\nEspecially since I had actually accomplished something since I got here. So I grabbed some dinner at a local diner and planned to go back to my hotel room. I had just gotten in my car when there was a knock on the driver\u2019s side window.  \n\n\nMy jaw dropped when I looked up and saw Jason. He was dressed casually in clothes that looked a little beat up, but there was no mistaking my brother.   \n\n\nI immediately opened the door and climbed out of the car so I could take a good look at Jason. His clothes were worn, he\u2019d been spending a lot of time outdoors, and he looked a little gaunt, but it was him. I never thought I\u2019d ever see Jason again. I thought he was lost forever. So I was ecstatic to see him. I could barely believe this was happening.   \n\n\n\u201cGood to see you Alex,\u201d he said nonchalantly as if our meeting was the most routine thing in the world.   \n\n\n\u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d I failed to keep the shock out of my voice.   \n\n\n\u201cI ran.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cFrom what?\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cThem.\u201d   \n\n\nThe simplicity of the response was chilling. It said so little and so much at the same time.   \n\n\n\u201cThem?\u201d I asked.  \n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say I was out in the woods, and it turns out I wasn\u2019t alone. I barely got away.\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cThe film crew that vanished?\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that, but it doesn\u2019t surprise me. We need to get out of here. Right now.\u201d   \n\n\nFrom the look in his eyes, I knew Jason was seriously afraid of something. And since I\u2019d accomplished what I set out to do here, I had no reason or desire to stay. So I got back in the car, he hopped in beside me, and I pulled out of the parking lot.  \n\n\n\u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d I asked him once we were heading down the road.  \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen you around town.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cWhere should we go?\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cAway from here.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cGot it. Can I ask why?\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cOf course. While working at the park I\u2019d heard rumors of the areas past. By now I\u2019m sure you know it used to be a prosperous mining area a few decades ago. Or at least it was until there was a nasty accident that resulted in the mining company closing down after a bunch of people died in the mine after there was a cave in. I heard rumors that there were a few people that survived the accident, but never came out of the mine and vanished into the hills. I\u2019d always considered it just a campfire story until one night a few weeks ago. A group of people came out of nowhere, chased me into a cave, and I\u2019d thought I\u2019d never get out. When I was finally able to escape, I was in the middle of nowhere and had to use my outdoors experience to find my way back here. Especially since I had no idea how many were out there or if I was being followed. That was why everyone thought I\u2019d disappeared.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cIf anyone could make it through that, it would be you.\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cAppreciate it.\u201d   \n\n\nThe road we were on had narrowed down to one lane, and I was acutely aware that we were surrounded by tall trees on this stretch of road. But when the road turned and I saw the road was blocked by a massive fallen tree, my stomach clenched, and I felt my blood freeze in my veins. I quickly tried to back up, but when I did, I felt the tires run over something and I knew they would be flat in no time at all.   \n\n\nI didn\u2019t dare get out of the car. That was what whoever was behind this wanted. So I took a deep breath and looked outside. Darkness had settled on the area, and there were only a few streetlights illuminating the road out here. But even that was enough light for me to see some shadows moving at the far end of the road by the woods coming slowly towards us. The sight made me grip the steering wheel so hard my knuckles turned white.   \n\n\n\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d I managed to ask Jason.   \n\n\n\u201cStay calm. They want us to panic.\u201d   \n\n\nBefore he could say another word, headlights blazed to life out of a cluster of trees to our right, and I thought for sure the vehicle they belonged to was going to crash straight into us. But I watched as the vehicle in question, a small RV, roared past us, parked alongside us on the curb, and the driver\u2019s side window rolled down.   \n\n\nI got another shock when I realized it was one of the members of the missing film crew.   \n\n\n\u201cGet in!\u201d she yelled to us.  \n\n\nShe didn\u2019t need to tell us twice. Jason and I immediately got out of my rental car and ran to the RV\u2019s door and climbed inside. Once Jason slammed the door shut, the driver immediately took off and we were out of there. As I tried to catch my breath, I found myself face to face with the rest of the film crew, who were sitting comfortably around the RV\u2019s interior.   \n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I said once I\u2019d sat down on the floor.  \n\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d a woman with curly blond hair who was sitting in an armchair said. \u201cWe\u2019d been watching what they were up to for hours. We knew they were up to something, we were just waiting for them to act so we could do something about it.\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cIs that why no one\u2019s seen you guys for a while?\u201d Jason asked.   \n\n\nA guy sitting on the couch nodded. \u201cYes. We\u2019d stumbled upon them while researching a different abandoned mine, and it became the subject of our footage. Are you that park ranger who went missing?\u201d   \n\n\n\u201cUh huh,\u201d Jason said. \u201cI stumbled across them too.\u201d   \n\n\nJason and the film crew talked for the rest of the drive until we eventually made our way back to town and went straight to the police. After we explained what happened and the film crew showed them the footage they had, the police went out to where my rental car had been left on the road. It was just as we\u2019d left it. They searched the area thoroughly, and nothing ever turned up. But at least now everyone knows to be alert, and that\u2019s something.   \n\n\nAfter that, Jason came home, and everyone was beyond stunned by what happened. No one was surprised when he took another park ranger job, but this time much closer to home. The documentary the crew had been working on was eventually released and won some awards. Jason and I even went along to a few showings to talk to the audience. It was definitely a unique experience.",

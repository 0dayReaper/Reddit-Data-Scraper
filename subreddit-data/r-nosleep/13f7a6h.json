    "postText": "Those aren\u2019t the words a six-year-old girl wants to hear from an old, disgruntled man in a fast-food restaurant. I remember the sudden coldness of his emaciated hand on my shoulder. The vicious voids in place of his eyes. The anger on his lips as he nodded his head at the beef burger in my hands. I\u2019d never felt such fear, and I started to quiver in terror. Fortunately, my dad aggressively shooed the creeper away, and I found myself eyeballing the burger.\n  \n\n  \n\u201cFucking arsehole,\u201d My dad muttered whilst my mum consoled me. \u201cWhy was he bothering Amelia?\u201d\n  \n\n  \n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my food, Dad?\u201d I asked, sniffling.\n  \n\n  \nHe smiled, ruffling my hair. \u201cNothing, sweetheart. That was just... an unwell man.\u201d\n  \n\n  \nBut my dad was wrong, as I would learn over the coming weeks. After eating that burger, my sense of smell drastically improved, I didn\u2019t need as much sleep, and I found myself craving food that I knew I shouldn\u2019t eat. I imagine you\u2019ve started to put things together. My traits changed with every piece of meat I ate.\n  \n\n  \nOnly meat.\n  \n\n  \nThe primary horror was the sudden onset of uncontrollable, animalistic urges. I often felt my intelligence slipping away after assuming an animal\u2019s mindset. It was hard to rationalise and process thoughts. And I was too afraid to tell my parents. I know that was stupid, but I was only six, and I thought I\u2019d done something wrong. But I was smart enough to put the pieces of the jigsaw together, and I decided to become vegetarian after a week of experiencing transformations from meat-based meals.\n  \n\n  \nThe strange thoughts, feelings, and sensory changes vanished after a week or so. My humanity returned, and I put the terrifying experience out of my mind. But a terrible thing happened last weekend, nearly twenty years after the torture that I half-convinced myself to be a figment of a child\u2019s overactive imagination.\n  \n\n  \nI accidentally ate meat.\n  \n\n  \n\u201cI love you guys,\u201d Paul drunkenly announced.\n  \n\n  \nI was enjoying a wonderful camping trip with my friends, and Paul secretively cooked dinner, refusing to let anyone intervene \u2013 he wanted the dish to be a surprise. He clumsily handed out plates of colourful food, and I exchanged a concerned look with Rachael, my best friend.\n  \n\n  \n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d She asked, smirking.\n  \n\n  \n\u201cThat\u2019s for me to know and you to\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Paul snorted, losing his train of thought.\n  \n\n  \nAs soon as I swallowed that first mouthful of food, I knew something was wrong. It was a sickening sensation I hadn\u2019t felt since childhood. Something was taking control of my mind and body.\n  \n\n  \n\u201cPaul\u2026\u201d I groaned, plate trembling in my hands. \u201cIs there\u2026 meat in this?\u201d\n  \n\n  \nMike\u2019s eyed widened. \u201cPaul! You idiot! You know Amelia's a vegetarian!\u201d\n  \n\n  \n\u201cOh, shit\u2026\u201d He gasped. \u201cI forgot.\u201d\n  \n\n  \n\u201cYou forgot?\u201d Rachael cried incredulously.\n  \n\n  \n\u201cI\u2019ve not been friends with her for that long,\u201d He muttered sheepishly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Amelia.\u201d\n  \n\n  \n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d I growled, wrestling with the bombardment of overwhelming thoughts and desires. \u201cWhat meat did you feed to me?\u201d\n  \n\n  \n\u201cI wanted to impress you guys,\u201d He said sadly. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 Nile Crocodile meat in a roasted vegetable stew. I bought it online and had it imported. Costed a fortune, but\u2013\u201d\n  \n\n  \n\u201cFucking moron!\u201d Mike interrupted. \u201cAmelia, are you going to be\u2026 Wait, Amelia...?\u201d\n  \n\n  \nI was crawling on my hands and knees towards the tent. When I consume meat, it\u2019s never an outwardly-visible transformation, but one of the mind. That being said, there were physical changes beneath the surface. Changes more terrifying than any transformation I\u2019d ever experienced before. Of course. I\u2019d eaten crocodile. One of Earth\u2019s deadliest animals. Often unreasonably cruel creatures. Do I know that from reading about them? No. I know it because I *felt* it.\n  \n\n  \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Amelia,\u201d Paul sniffled, stumbling around the campfire to help me. \u201cAre you gonna be sick? Is that what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n  \n\n  \n*I\u2019ll play a game with him*, I thought, but it wasn\u2019t *my* thought.\n  \n\n  \nDriven by urges beyond my control, I found myself turning to look at Paul \u2013 softening him with crocodile tears. Rachael and Mike were watching me with worried expressions, but Paul was too inebriated to be wary of my erratic behaviour.\n  \n\n  \n\u201cI feel awful,\u201d He said. \u201cLet me give you a hug.\u201d\n  \n\n  \nI didn\u2019t want to lull my friend into a false sense of security, but I was helpless in the face of the horror that was stealing my body from me. And for a fleeting moment, between the blackened trees of the forest, I saw him.\n  \n\n  \nThe haunting man who cursed me twenty years ago.\n  \n\n  \n*Has he been watching over me for all of that time?* I fearfully wondered as the wicked wizard took the reins. Internally screaming, I could only watch as my body lunged at Paul and my teeth sank into his forearm. All I could think was that his surprise tasted sweet, but, again, it wasn\u2019t my thought. I don\u2019t even think it was the thought of a crocodile. No, it was the man. The man who had been following me for twenty years.\n  \n\n  \nPaul wailed at the gaping wound in his arm, and I joined him. They weren\u2019t crocodile tears \u2013 I genuinely felt a harrowing sense of horror beyond words. After all, I was trapped in my own body, helplessly watching the blood trickle down Paul's arm. And then I watched my friends run away, leaving me to contend with the terrifying man in the trees. They didn\u2019t even seem to notice him.\n  \n\n  \n\u201cYou are what you eat,\u201d The spectre whispered. \u201cOh, Amelia. You were being well-behaved for so many years\u2026\u201d\n  \n\n  \nI sobbed intensely. \u201cPlease\u2026 Stop this\u2026 Help me\u2026\u201d\n  \n\n  \n\u201cYes,\u201d He smiled. \u201cI can make it stop. Why don\u2019t you eat this?\u201d\n  \n\n  \nThe elderly, crooked man held something small in his left hand. It was a dark object that I couldn\u2019t distinguish.\n  \n\n  \n\u201cIt\u2019ll make everything better,\u201d He cooed, striding towards me. \u201cYou are what you eat, and this is *death itself*.\u201d\n  \n\n  \nI screamed, or attempted to scream, but could only feebly gasp for air as I crawled backwards. I wished my friends hadn't fled. I was alone in that blackened forest, staring into the face of Hell incarnate.\n  \n\n  \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to die,\u201d I pleaded, blubbering as I had in that restaurant.\n  \n\n  \n\u201cThen you must accept your fate,\u201d He said, smiling.\n  \n\n  \nThere\u2019s a hole in my memory after the perturbing man\u2019s final line. When I woke in my bed, I had no recollection of returning home.\n  \n\n  \nWhat did I do for the rest of the evening?\n  \n\n  \nI\u2019ve no idea what\u2019s real anymore. Did I hallucinate my encounter with the demonic man in the forest? I don\u2019t think so. But I definitely know the horror at the campfire was real because my friends won\u2019t reply to my texts. I don\u2019t blame them. I pray that Paul simply ghosts me, rather than getting the police involved.\n  \n\n  \nThe cravings are crippling. I feel violent. *So* violent. And my sense of empathy is dwindling. I\u2019m wrestling with the very concept of morality \u2013 do I even care about what happened to Paul? That\u2019s the terrifying question.\n  \n\n  \nIf I avoid people for a few more days, my mind and body should return to normal. But what then? I have to live the rest of my life in fear of eating meat. I fear for those around me, but I also fear the man who inflicted this nightmare upon me. Why me? Why not any other meat-eater in that restaurant? I was just a child. An innocent child. I don\u2019t know what kind of message he was trying to send.\n\n\n  \nI fear that he might make me do something much worse next time.\n  \n\n  \n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

    "postText": "Let me start off by saying that I\u2019m not particularly religious. If you asked me if I believed in God, I\u2019d probably just shrug, grunt out a few words about being on the fence about it and continue with my day. \n\nOf course, that was before last night. \n\nMy friends are the kinds of people who like wild nights. Crazy parties, snort a bit of coke, take a bit of e in the bathroom, maybe hook up with someone and leave a text on my phone at ten past who-the- fuck-knows telling me they don\u2019t need that ride I\u2019m offering after all. \n\nNot to say I don\u2019t like a drink, I do, it\u2019s just\u2026 clubs aren\u2019t my style. Lying low in a pub somewhere, drink in hand, listening to the tv drone on to whatever channel some scruffy guy in the back barked out for\u2026 I guess that\u2019s my idea of fun. \n\nSo when my friends tell me they want to go out for a night on the town, I say sure. I hang on for the first club, buy a non-alcoholic beer in case my car\u2019s required and try to pretend that I\u2019m having fun. By the time I see them grinding on girls, on guys, when they strike conversation with someone who definitely might be a dealer, well, I decide my services are no longer needed. We aren\u2019t too far out, the night tube is on beck and call and I can always find my car the next day. \n\nThat\u2019s when I wander out of the club, look for something a little more rustic. Not that that\u2019s hard to find, not at all. \n\nI found myself in a bit of a state inside of a bar called the Ragged Feather. Wasn\u2019t a fan of the name all that much, but the drinks were cheap and the largest demographic seemed to be middle aged men watching reruns of the football. \n\nI tried to pretend I hadn\u2019t just staggered out of a club with my ears ringing. I slicked my hair back, slipped my phone into my hand and wandered over to the bar. I took a double shot of whiskey and drank it in one hit. Just because I wasn\u2019t at the club didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t have a good time. \n\nI hung at the bar a while on my own, scrolled through my phone pretending I was doing something far more impressive than I really was. I kept an ear out for the guys on the sofas. They\u2019d get vocal every now and then. I think the football was just running highlights, but they were incredibly dedicated to their teams. \n\nI got another whiskey and bled into the background.\n\nOf course, stragglers from clubs are commonplace. It wasn\u2019t long until some scantily dressed women staggered in, laughing, chuckling, pointing for where they wanted to sit. I saw a guy walk in with his friend slung over his shoulder. Catatonic, most likely. He threw his friend onto one of the leather sofas ingrained with beer and smokes and demanded two pints of water and all the peanuts the bar had in stock.\n\nThe bartenders seemed bitterly amused.\n\nSome of the girls were taking selfies. Snapchatting their friends who were still at the club. They were ordering shots, gearing themselves up for the next leg of their night. \n\nA couple blokes wandered in with curries in take out trays. I saw someone eat a Big Mac on the outside seating through the window. \n\nThis was a night for the young and inebriated and my mind was just dulled enough by the whiskey to enjoy the characters I could watch peaceably without interacting with.\n\nThat is, until someone slipped into the seat next to me.\n\n\u201cDo I look like a girl with daddy issues?\u201d\n\nShe was of average height, although that wasn\u2019t apparent immediately due to the fact that she was leaning her arms heavily against the bar. She was slim, with short and astoundingly bright red hair. It framed her round face, a face that was marred with smudged eye shadow, smudged lipstick\u2026 hell, it looked like her make-up was in the process of melting right from her face. There was a chip knotted into a curl in her hair, just by her forehead.\n\nThe drunk side of me was actually tempted to pick it out.\n\nThe girl was clearly drunk, and as I looked around the bar, I couldn\u2019t quite place where she had come from. She didn\u2019t belong to the crowd of selfie takers, she wasn\u2019t with the catatonic guys. I hoped for her safety that she wasn\u2019t with the middle-aged men. I tried to look out the window, to see if maybe a group was missing one inebriated, bright haired girl, but I couldn\u2019t. The window had fogged up. Too much heat inside, not enough outside.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked her.\n\nShe pointed her finger at me. \u201cAnswer my question,\u201d she slurred.\n\n\u201cUh.\u201d I really wasn\u2019t sure what to say. I settled on staring at her awkwardly, trying to answer her with the bemused expression on my face.\n\nThe girl\u2019s lips curled into a drunken smile. She snorted, placing a hand over her mouth to smother her laughter. It only really aided the deconstruction of her lipstick. \n\n\u201cI do, you know,\u201d she said, pushing herself up a little against the bar. \u201cHave daddy issues, I mean. In case that wasn\u2019t obvious.\u201d She gestured to herself. To the mussed clothing that must have looked quite spectacular when she\u2019d left home that evening. To the stains that looked a lot like old food. The sticky residue on her neck and shoulders that was quite obviously a thrown drink.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked her.\n\nHer hair had curled around her neck, I realised. It was sticky with that same substance. She was a wreck.\n\n\u201cI got in a couple of fights, no big deal,\u201d she said, shrugging. \u201cDidn\u2019t start any of course, no, I don\u2019t do that. But my father\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYour dad did this to you?\u201d\n\nShe smiled brightly. \u201cIn a way.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you need me to call someone?\u201d I already had my phone in my hand. The girl looked like she was probably in her early twenties, but that didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t have been suffering from some kind of paternal abuse. The only number I knew off the bat was Childline, which wasn\u2019t quite appropriate. The police? Jesus, was I going to have to deal with the cops tonight? While my friends were snorting coke not two doors down?\n\nThe girl pushed my hand down firmly. She was already shaking her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she told me. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to call anyone.\u201d Now her expression changed. It wasn\u2019t the attempted sultry look I\u2019d seen on many girls of her state; it was open and wide and engaging. She wanted something from me and I felt compelled to give it to her. \u201cI want something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I asked her.\n\n\u201cTo tell you a story,\u201d the girl said, before glancing to the bar, \u201cand for you to buy me a drink. The universe is a pain sometimes and I\u2019m afraid I think I might have lost my wallet.\u201d\n\nI laughed. I didn\u2019t know this girl, didn\u2019t know where she\u2019d come from at all. My nights were generally about getting comfortably wasted and making sure my friends weren\u2019t dead in a ditch by the end of it all. I was used to getting hit on every now and then, but even as I was sat on that bar stool with a drink in my hand, I knew that this wasn\u2019t what this was. This girl had no intention of getting into my pants. All she wanted was to talk.\n\nI guess I was okay with that.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your poison?\u201d I asked her.\n\nHer lips quirked. \u201cAppletini.\u201d\n\nThe bar offered a very limited cocktail menu, but by some miracle I was able to order her an Appletini from the list. I ordered a cider to go with it, suddenly a little too aware of where this night could go. I\u2019d unthinkingly supplied this liquored-up stranger with even more alcohol and she had clearly had a rough night of it. A part of my old instinct came back \u2013 the same instinct that had me texting my friends every few hours to make sure they hadn\u2019t wandered off to somewhere dangerous beyond the club. With no one but the bartender aware of our existence on these stools, I realised that I was suddenly responsible for this very drunk stranger.\n\nThe girl coddled her drink, running her finger delicately over the rim of the muggy martini glass. \u201cThis takes me back,\u201d the girl said amiably. She looked at me suddenly, her green eyes startling. \u201cYou know what this was called originally?\u201d She smirked before I could answer. \u201cAn Adam\u2019s Apple Martini.\u201d\n\nI snorted. \u201cYeah, I think I\u2019ve heard that before.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, it wasn\u2019t actually an apple,\u201d she continued, eyes moving back to her glass. \u201cThe texts translated that part wrongly, mostly because you people don\u2019t have a word for it anymore. The fruit was incredibly exotic and, to be honest, it doesn\u2019t exist in this realm of existence. Only Eden.\u201d She laughed dreamily. \u201cAnd Eden\u2019s long gone.\u201d\n\nI stared at her. \u201cAre you\u2026 okay?\u201d It was more honest than the last time I\u2019d asked her. Mostly because I was beginning to feel a little dread creep into my stomach.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the girl said, grinning widely. \u201cWhy do you keep asking?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean,\u201d I stuttered, \u201cI just, now, don\u2019t take this the wrong way or anything but\u2026 you look\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLike someone poured their drink over me?\u201d the girl asked. \u201cLike someone else threw their kebab on my dress and another unpleasant chap littered me with his fish and chips? That I have been hit, slapped around a bit and left in the gutter for the rats to find me?\u201d\n\nShe held my eyes for an incredibly long time before her face broke out into a grin. \u201cYeah, something like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would they do that?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d the girl shot back. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t that great and alcohol makes them worse.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cSometimes makes them better. Nicer, a little looser in the sack\u2026 but mostly just annoying and a little smelly.\u201d\n\nI looked at her, I watched her knock back her drink. She exuded the intelligence to know just how ironic her words were, but she was neither caring nor apologetic about them. \n\nThe girl looked at me again. \u201cYou bought me a drink. Now you can listen to my story.\u201d\n\nI nodded wordlessly.\n\nShe smiled, pointing at the bartender and then at her drink. The bartender was already making her another. \n\n\u201cEden,\u201d the girl said, reiterating her earlier babble as though the words had only just come out of her mouth. \u201cThey always think that\u2019s my fault, you know. The reason Adam and Eve got kicked out of their perfect little nudist paradise.\u201d She shot me a knowing glance. \u201cOnly in Eden can you sit on the grass butt naked and not get a pine cone stuck in your crack.\u201d\n\nI blinked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not following.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d the girl said. \u201cMy story won\u2019t make any sense without a proper introduction.\u201d She reached out her hand. \u201cHello. My name\u2019s Lucifer.\u201d She winked. \u201cBut you can call me Lucy.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s an uncomfortable heat that stretches through your veins when you first go into fight or flight mode. Adrenaline pounds through your blood and all you want to do is get up and go. It overrides everything else.\n\nA lot of things made sense when the girl told me her name. For starters, that she was crazy. She had to be. She looked like she\u2019d been attacked on four separate occasions in one night and up until that moment, I hadn\u2019t known how that could be possible. Behind the melty make-up and dirty clothes, she was rather attractive and her attitude hadn\u2019t come off as catty or rude. \n\nIf she\u2019d been going around telling people she was the devil, though? That gets a reaction out of people.\n\nI suddenly felt myself looking at her wrist, down towards her ankles. Did she have some kind of cuff on from one of those mental institutions? Had she broken out of hospital after a nasty bump on the head? Was any of this even happening at all?\n\nI really would have to call the cops.\n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d the girl \u2013 Lucy \u2013 said. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking that I\u2019m crazy, that you need to get out of here. Maybe you even think I\u2019m aggressive.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you?\u201d I asked her.\n\n\u201cWould I be here with you, drinking Appletinis if I were?\u201d she asked, fluttering her eyelashes.\n\n\u201cWould you look the way you do if you weren\u2019t?\u201d I shot back.\n\nShe grinned, toasting her new glass. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d\n\nUnthinkingly, I clinked my cider against it.\n\nThen I frowned.\n\nShe chuckled, leaning closer. \u201cLet\u2019s have a little wager,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me tell you my story and, if you believe me when I\u2019m done, you can\u2019t go about trying to get me locked away somewhere.\u201d\n\nI stared at her. \u201cIf I ended up believing you, then why would I do that?\u201d\n\nShe smirked, sipping her drink. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised what people do when they believe you\u2019re the devil.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you do this often?\u201d I asked. \u201cTell people you\u2019re Satan?\u201d\n\nShe snorted into her drink. \u201cNot as often as I should. But it\u2019s been a rough day and a Hell of a long lifetime. I\u2019d like to have a chat if that\u2019s alright with you.\u201d\n\nI waved to the bartender for another whiskey. The girl\u2019s eyes glinted with humour. I wasn\u2019t necessarily trapped with her, but a part of me didn\u2019t want to leave without first hearing what she had to say. Besides, at the end of it all I couldn\u2019t just leave a crazy girl to wander around London alone at night.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d I said, taking a swig of my drink. \u201cEden?\u201d\n\nLucy laughed. \n\n\u201cAdam and Eve?\u201d I continued. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that\u2019s true. God created two humans and we all came from them?\u201d\n\n\u201cGod made two prototypes,\u201d Lucy corrected with a raised finger. \u201cMy father created angels as his toy soldiers, but he had failed to make anything like himself. After us, it was his next big project and he spent every waking hour of existence slaving over his two prototypes. He gave them a perfect utopia to live inside of, but he wanted to test them. He wanted to know whether they had free will.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd did they?\u201d\n\nLucy\u2019s face soured. \u201cNo. My father could never bring himself to go that far. He tempted them with the idea of knowledge beyond their understanding and told them exactly what they could do to claim it as their own. But to be able to create a being that could go against his Law? Oh\u2026 my father is a very controlling being. He was afraid to unleash that ability unto them.\u201d\n\nLucy was very adamant in her delusions, that was clear to me. She spoke about her father with such distaste that I began to feel bad for her. Only someone who had been hurt very badly would have the gall to spite God himself.\n\n\u201cAnd what?\u201d I asked her, entertaining her delusion. \u201cYou were the one that tempted them in the garden? The devil has been a girl this whole time?\u201d\n\nShe smiled. \u201cI dabble.\u201d Then she looked at me, raising a brow. \u201cAll of humanity thinks that temptation came in the form of a snake. The snake\u2019s legs were taken away as punishment for drawing Eve towards the forbidden fruit.\u201d She laughed, a hard and short sound. \u201cSnakes never had legs and it was not a sin to tempt those poor prototypes into doing what they did next.\u201d\n\nHer shoulders were very tense as she took her next sip, but her eyes were filled with exhilaration. She seemed thrilled to be telling me this.\n\n\u201cI was the favoured child, my father loved and adored me. He named me the light bringer, I was stood at his side during the creation of this Earth. During the creation of humanity.\u201d She pursed her lips, slamming her empty glass against the table. The bartender eagerly went about making another. \u201cMy father couldn\u2019t bring himself to go that extra mile, so he asked me to walk amongst the prototypes and tempt them myself. Draw out their desire for the forbidden power he had hinted at.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying God wanted us to know this stuff?\u201d I asked her sceptically. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying God was afraid of his own power and wanted very desperately to share what he knew with the creation he had made. Right and wrong, left and right, all that stuff.\u201d Lucy shrugged. \u201cAre you familiar with the story of Prometheus?\u201d\n\nI frowned at her. \u201cGreek, right? They say he stole fire from the gods or something, to help\u2026\u201d The whiskey was making things a little foggy and I struggled with the direction I\u2019d been heading.\n\nLucy grinned. \u201cCorrect,\u201d she said, cutting off my attempt. \u201cPrometheus stole fire from the gods to ensure that humanity progressed. You\u2019ll find that every culture has an idea about where humans got their ability to evolve, to move forward, to create. God was the creator, and he wanted to give that ability to his prototypes. I gave them that ability by tempting Eve to eat the fruit.\u201d She shrugged impassively. \u201cNow the world sees me as the ultimate evil.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf what you\u2019re saying is true,\u201d I said slowly, \u201cthen God must be just like us.\u201d\n\nLucy\u2019s lips thinned into a feral smile. \u201cMy father is very ego centric. He may have planned to create you in his image, but in the end all he managed was to mould your minds into his. He gave you autonomy, the ability to think for yourselves. His angels were his soldiers and I was his most faithful. Until that day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAngels don\u2019t have free will?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lucy said, \u201cthey don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what about the Devil?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know why I was suddenly so intrigued, but hearing religious ideals from someone who believed to have lived them herself was quite possibly one of the most interesting things that had ever happened to me. I may have only ever visited church to please my parents as a child, but suddenly I was reawakened to the idea. A part of me was aware of this and afraid of the outcome, but I was just drunk enough not to care at that moment.\n\n\u201cThe Devil has will of her own,\u201d Lucy said, tilting her glass towards me with silent appraisal. \u201cBy guiding Eve to the tree, something woke inside of me that day and I realised just what I had been missing. Just what my brothers and sisters had been missing. We were obediently following our father for the simple reason that he was our creator, but once I had been given free will, I realised just how pompous and self-entitled he had become. In a lonely, passion filled moment he had decided to create his little human prototypes, only to very quickly realise what giving them their free will would mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be able to control them,\u201d I said.\n\nLucy nodded. \u201cExactly. And after, he realised quicker still that he could no longer control me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo he sent you to Hell.\u201d\n\nLucy nearly choked on her drink. She smiled around her glass. \u201cLet\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.\u201d\n\nI sobered a little, straightening in my seat. The people in the bar were suddenly so quiet around me and I no longer cared what they had to say or the characters that they portrayed. The only character I cared for was Lucy.\n\n\u201cI tried to explain to my siblings what had happened in Eden and what had happened to me by default, but they wouldn\u2019t listen to me. They didn\u2019t understand free will \u2013 how could they? I only knew it because I\u2019d been given it by mistake. At that moment, I didn\u2019t even know that I had free will, only that I was suddenly aware of all of my father\u2019s flaws. My siblings couldn\u2019t see those flaws and so they thought I had suddenly turned cruel and was abandoning our father by exposing him as a sham for the ruler we all thought him to be.\u201d\n\nLucy sighed heavily. \u201cAdam and Eve and all the creations that followed were booted out of my father\u2019s perfect little Utopia. Now they had his knowledge, my father was terrified of what he had done. And after what had happened to me, I could recognise his terror and understand the loneliness he had felt that had guided him into using me in the first place.\u201d Lucy\u2019s eyes were heavy-lidded, her sadness was almost palpable. \u201cI thought that- I thought that he would want to spend even more time with me than before. After all, we were more alike than any of his other children. But he became distant; quiet. He played around with his little humans every once in a while, but mostly he condemned them. He blamed them for his weakness.\u201d She smiled weakly. \u201cHe blamed me.\u201d\n\nLucy\u2019s story was turning more and more into that of a child with a distant, somewhat abusive father. I had known many kids with a background like hers, and now I was beginning to fear just how much of her story was rooted in truth. I\u2019d heard that it was easier to sink into fantasy when you had been abused, and I wondered if that was the reason for her story. For her desperation to share it with me \u2013 a complete and total stranger.\n\nI respected her wager. Whether or not I liked it, I felt compelled to let her tell me her whole story before I tried to judge or unravel it. I sat quietly, letting her come around as she played with the last of her drink.\n\n\u201cIt became clear,\u201d Lucy said after a long moment\u2019s pause, \u201cthat I no longer belonged where I was. I couldn\u2019t follow my father\u2019s plan because I could see that he no longer had one. My siblings refused to see reason and so, eventually, I was met by many of them, headed by my father. He told me all that I feared, he told me that I no longer belonged where I was. I wasn\u2019t an angel anymore. I was no longer his light bringer. His Lucifer. I was a mutation of his will. And so he extracted me from grace. And I fell.\u201d\n\nA long silence stretched between us, only interrupted when the bartender poured us two new drinks. Lucy drank hers reflectively. I didn\u2019t touch mine.\n\n\u201cI am afraid,\u201d Lucy said quietly, \u201cthat this is the part that generally makes people want to punch me in the face.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked. \u201cBecause your dad threw you out?\u201d I paused, trying to abide to her metaphor. \u201cThat he put you in Hell?\u201d\n\nLucy laughed sadly. \u201cAh, humans. My father gave you his way of thinking and look at you.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo, not because he put me in Hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why?\u201d \n\n\u201cI fell to Earth,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cFather gave me dominion of the one place he thought I would fit in. Humans had free will, so did I. What is the saying? A match made in Heaven?\u201d She snorted dismally. \u201cOf course, that\u2019s not quite right, is it? When I fell, I was faced with a humanity that was so different from my father\u2019s little prototypes.\u201d\n\nHer tone had changed. There was an aggression behind her words that began to unsettle me all over again.\n\n\u201cI saw emperors and kings, governments and churches. I saw corporations who claimed to be rulers, presidents and big fat dictators. And I watched. I watched as humanity fought and lost, and finally, just finally, they gave up altogether. They were no longer able to rise up to all the greed and control set upon them. There was just too much to change and humans soon realised they just weren\u2019t as free as they thought they were. Sure, they live under the illusion that they have free lives, but most of them simply do not.\u201d She clicked her tongue. \u201cI grew to loathe you all.\u201d\n\nThen, she took another hit of her drink.\n\n\u201cI can see what you mean,\u201d I said, allowing my gaze \u2013 for the first time since meeting her \u2013 to graze over the other individuals in the bar. At the girls playing with their phones, the boys trying desperately to sober up, the men enraptured with their game of football on the telly. We all led very different lives, and we were all here to get drunk, to lose ourselves in entertainment. It hadn\u2019t been the first time that I\u2019d wondered what we were hiding from by doing this. And I knew then that I wasn\u2019t the only person to think it.\n\n\u201cYou hide behind your alcohol and poor choices and pretend you have free will,\u201d Lucy said, waving her hand across the room. No one paid us any attention. \u201cIt\u2019s true \u2013 my father gave you the will to make those decisions, but you squander it. The free will I fell to provide to all of you, the free will I was given by a twisted mistake, and you make a mockery of it. You follow senseless leaders without questioning them, you abide by laws made centuries ago that no longer make sense. You do these things because you have given up on the opportunity to follow the will of your own, not of others.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t all of us, though, is it?\u201d I asked her, trying for some reason to defend our species from the mad young woman. \u201cBecause you see it on the news all the time, don\u2019t you? People do rise up, we do protest. People can make a difference.\u201d\n\nLucy laughed bitterly, nibbling the rim of her glass. \u201cReally?\u201d she said. \u201cYou can sit here and say that it can\u2019t be all bad because of the few that refuse to conform? Those you call your rebels? They make up for it all?\u201d She grinned around her glass. \u201cBy that logic, I am the biggest rebel of them all. Am I expected to make up for all your sorry mistakes?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy your logic,\u201d I said, \u201cyou should be punishing it, right? If that\u2019s what this metaphor is all about.\u201d I laughed, I couldn\u2019t help myself. I took a sip of my drink. \u201cIs this whole story just so you can tell me that you think we\u2019re all going to Hell? If so, I think I can see why people want to punch you.\u201d\n\nLucy didn\u2019t say a word. Simply, she watched me. It felt unnerving to have someone like her watching me like that, with an intelligence that went beyond anything I\u2019d come across at gone midnight in a seedy bar. The drunkenness in her eyes was no longer present, her face wasn\u2019t flushed like before and even her makeup couldn\u2019t represent the mess I\u2019d seen when she\u2019d first appeared on the stool by my side. It was like I was looking at someone else entirely.\n\nAnd I was afraid.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s review what you\u2019ve said,\u201d Lucy said slowly, articulately. She wasn\u2019t slurring. Had she been slurring before? \u201cYou think I\u2019m going to tell you that humanity is going to Hell because you refuse to use the gift I gave you.\u201d Her nails curled into the bar. \u201cMy father may have been the one to guide me, but I paid for his mistakes. I am the one responsible for your will in the eyes of your species, but that was never true. You are responsible for what you do here, not me.\u201d\n\nShe pursed her lips, tapping the bar as a bartender filled her drink again. \u201cTell me, do you remember my mentioning Hell at any point during my story, or was that just you?\u201d\n\nI opened my mouth to answer, but something faltered. My lips trembled and I slammed them shut.\n\nLucy smiled, taking a sip. \u201cThought not.\u201d She looked away, eyes scanning the room lazily. \u201cWhat I did say is something that is indeed mentioned in your scriptures. My father gave me dominion of Earth. A place filled with free will. Free will that goes to waste.\u201d Her lip twisted. \u201cHumans sin all the time. Not because of me, not because of evil or my dominion over this place. Fact is, I don\u2019t lift a finger. I don\u2019t, because I don\u2019t see the point. You make terrible decisions and follow mindless leaders, you do bad things and you make a mess of your Earth.\u201d Lucy\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cDo you know how much suffering is happening all over the planet right now? How many people are dying of illnesses that could have easily been cured, but aren\u2019t because of the selfishness of humanity? Do you know how many children are being abused, raped, forced into marriage? How many people have been forced to become soldiers in meaningless wars? How many humans have killed for ideals they don\u2019t believe in?\u201d\n\nI stayed very quiet. There was nothing I could say. Lucy\u2019s words were unbearably honest and every sentence sliced into me like a blade. I felt cold and sick and terrified.\n\n\u201cWar, famine, pestilence, death, these things are all present and they have nothing to do with me or to do with any deity. They are all here because of you. Not because of your free will, but your inability to use it.\u201d \n\nLucy smiled at me, a grin so cold and unnatural that I felt like I should run all over again. But I stayed where I was, frozen to my very core, because I wanted to hear what she had to say. Because I needed to.\n\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s the kicker,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cBecause this is the part that actually enrages people enough to kick me.\u201d She winked. \u201cHell isn\u2019t what happens after you die. Hell is right here, right now. Somewhere through the many scriptures, a few words got crossed over and people started thinking that Hell was a punishment after you die. Fact is, Hell is Earth. My Earth. God gave this place to me to do with it what I will and I\u2026 I refuse to do anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d I asked, because I was suddenly very desperate.\n\n\u201cExactly what you think,\u201d Lucy said, toasting her glass. I didn\u2019t reciprocate, and she laughed. A light and airy sound. \u201cI had so many plans for your species, I wanted for us to rejoice in our free will together, to create a place that was free from the cruelty and power my father exuded over the angels \u2013 his first borns. I wanted to make a real utopia. Unfortunately, you humans just don\u2019t want that.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cMy father sent me down here thinking I had become one of you. All that I have learned is that he gave you much more of his image than he ever intended.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d I said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it isn\u2019t funny,\u201d Lucy said, grinning even wider to prove her sick irony. \u201cHumans punish themselves by sitting by and doing nothing. They have made their own Hell and, you know what\u2019s worse \u2013 what\u2019s ultimately worse? \u2013 some of you are so blind to it that you think your life is Heavenly.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t wait for me to ask what she meant, she simply barrelled forward: \u201cThe rich and powerful, those in positions that steal from everyone else? They get a taste of the good life, that\u2019s very true. Then they die and they don\u2019t go to Hell. They come back here, to Earth. Which is Hell.\u201d She tipped her head. \u201cAre you following?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cReincarnation,\u201d Lucy said quickly, she practically purred the words. \u201cA neat little trick to make sure your souls stay here forever. You get a taste of the good life every once in a while, a handful of you at a time, and that\u2019s enough for you to believe that this is some kind of real middle-ground. That you aren\u2019t living Hell every day. Then, you die. You die for a moment and then you\u2019re in the body of someone facing the realities of Hell. But of course, you never remember the time you spent in a better life. A part of you just has that inkling to hope. That\u2019s all. Hope makes you think that it can all get better.\u201d\n\nShe slammed her drink so hard against the counter that it shattered. I didn\u2019t do anything, not even when flecks of glass littered my hands. I could only stare at her, a tightness in my chest constricting my very soul. No one else in this bar mattered in this moment, but of course that was what she had been saying this whole time, hadn\u2019t she? None of them noticed the scene, they were caught up in their own realities \u2013 their own Hells. \n\nThe bartender didn\u2019t clean the mess. The glass lay there, remnants of Lucy\u2019s words lying in a stolid mass on the streaked wooden surface. \n\n\u201cIt never gets better,\u201d Lucy spat. \u201cYou are stuck in a loop and, until you do something about it, you will never be free. None of you. And I won\u2019t do a thing to stop it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d I asked. I don\u2019t know when I started seeing the girl in front of me as more than a girl. But with a weakness threatening to pull me apart, I stared at the bright haired thing in front of me and I saw something more than a human in her early twenties. I saw more than a girl suffering abuse from her father.\n\nI saw a fallen angel. I saw a being with scars buried so deep that they existed beyond this realm of seeing entirely. I saw something that I would never be able to write down in words, no matter how long I lived. \n\n\u201cHow do we change this?\u201d I begged.\n\nBut Lucy didn\u2019t answer me. I didn\u2019t blame her for that. Blame gets thrown around so often and I knew then that she was sick of that. Sick of being blamed for our mistakes.\n\nSo I changed tactics. \u201cWhy me?\u201d\n\nIt was an honest question and I think somewhere deep down, Lucifer respected that honesty. \n\nWhich is why she said, \u201cWhen you first saw me, you were afraid for my safety. When I told you I was the devil, you wanted to lock me away, but still, you did so because you were afraid for me and not for yourself. You didn\u2019t wish to harm me, not even when I told you who I was and what I could be capable of for changing your sorry lives. You are a good person, but I am afraid that means nothing when you don\u2019t have the will to do anything with it.\u201d\n\nShe smiled at me sympathetically. The devil, showing sympathy for the human that sat across from her at the bar. It was surreal and, for a few heavy moments, I truly thought I must be dead. There was no other way to explain what I was seeing, who I was speaking with. What I had just heard.\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d\n\nLucy reached out to me. She placed a hand on my shoulder. Her hand was cold and warm at the same time, and I felt my blood boil where her fingers scraped my skin. \n\nAnd I knew.\n\nSharing a story like this isn\u2019t easy. Hell, it might be the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. Good thing there\u2019s no such thing as Hell, then, right?\n\nThe fact of the matter is simple. The world is a mess because we refuse to change anything. The devil herself walks among us and she desperately wants to make our lives better, but she won\u2019t. She won\u2019t, because we won\u2019t. We have to prove our will to her before she is willing to do anything herself. We have to be good to each other, to help us all to be free.\n\nOf course, Lucifer told me one last thing before she left that bar. One thing that will stick with me until this body is nothing but rot in the dirt.\n\n\u201cYou can tell as many people as you want, but take a good look at me. I have told five other humans this night the same things I have told you, and this was their reaction. They have hurt me, burned me, thrown their food and drink at me. Humans are afraid of their free will and they find it so much easier to hurt than to own up for their own inadequacies. You will only be free when you stop seeing yourself in the same way my father sees himself.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s what I\u2019ll leave you with. Lucifer won her wager that night and I let her walk out the door.\n\nAnd I beg you to do the same. If the devil approaches you one night, listen to what she has to say, and listen to what I have been able to tell you of our meeting.\n\nThe devil is real and she doesn\u2019t want to torture us.\n\nNo, we do that just fine on our own.\n",

She\u2019s doing the exact same thing that made her suffer, blaming humanities lack of action on them, while refusing to use her own. She fears free will just as much as her father, yet places the blame on us when we\u2019re afraid to use it. If humanity is trapped in an endless cycle of Hell, then Hell goes beyond Earth. It\u2019s a chain binding all of existence. Nobody uses the will they have because they place that burden on someone else, placing all blame on others while refusing to accept their own. The cycle will continue, never to be broken. How can anyone be expected to do what so few, if any at all, of existence has done?\n\nThat\u2019s the true irony in this story. The true horror. It brings in to question just how \u201cfree\u201d our will is. We say we\u2019re free to act as we wish, regardless of consequence, yet still we are bound not to use it. If free will has never been used, can it really be said to exist at all?\n\nThough, to play Devil\u2019s advocate (or adversary in this case. I suppose), all things should be taken with caution. It\u2019s good to be willing to hear a different side of a story, regardless of how hard it may be, but that doesn\u2019t mean it should be accepted because it makes sense. After all, you should probably be at least a little wary when trusting someone with an epithet of \u201cFather of Lies.\u201d\n\nRegardless if Lucy told the truth, or if it was a literal trick of the devil, the point that we should exercise our will to care for others still rings true. After all, the best lies are founded on truth. But which is the lie: the story Lucy told, or the very claim that free will can ever be used?",

Let me start with, I\u2019m 22 (so there\u2019s still a lot of room for ignorance and stupidity) I grew up Christian and slowly fell from my faith as I finished up High School. I still for some reason have a fascination with religion, so I still will listen to an audio sermon and an occasional book from my hometown pastor. \n\nAbout 10-12 years ago my pastor decided to make a shift in his philosophy (which let me say was detrimental to the church. Nearly half the congregation left and wanted nothing to do with what he preached). This shift was a moving away from what he coined \u201ceasy cheesy-cotton candy Christianity. For the past decade the real takeaway message has been that of the Golden Rule. \n\nAnyways my point in making this comment is there is a shift going on in the Christian faith. Pastors are moving away from \u201ceternal torment for the punishment of our sins\u201d and moving into the idea that Hell is a place on earth...and we\u2019re cultivating it. The message of love for neighbor needs to be spread. Otherwise we\u2019ll just stay stuck in this loop of violence. \n\nYou can\u2019t end war with more war\nYou can\u2019t end violence with more violence \nYou can\u2019t end hate with more hate\n\nThe US v. THEM game must come to an end before any progress towards a utopian society even becomes a possibility. ",

I have never found myself to be religious in any way, but this has captivated me and brought a sense of clarity and, to be honest, relief. \n\nReading that Lucy has been given dominion over Earth and choosing to do nothing for us because we are our own ruin and we are blinded by our own ideals that we have created to feel a sense of entitlement and power given to us by a God that was afraid of his own.\n\nThis is such a powerful read, it goes far deeper I think than people realise. Lucifer has existed among us forever, spoken to us, and as a result has been broken down and beaten by us because we are afraid of ourselves, we are afraid to admit that we are the problem, so we do more, fight more, to show we are *doing right* in a world where there inevitably is no such thing. Why would Lucifer help us if we can't even help ourselves? \n\nWe are born and our lives are already laid out for us, we say we have free will and say that we are free but all we do is conform, we conform to people and to Laws who claim to be above us. We are bound to this world. This \"Hell\".\n\nWe do not appreciate what we were given, we squander everything we have, take things for granted, even life itself. We do not notice the mass amount of suffering experienced by the millions of others every single day, simply because we do not witness it every day, or do not experience it ever. Yet we have the audacity to complain over trivial things that do not matter? \n\nWhy would Lucy help us? We don't deserve it. \n\nI wish I was to have this conversation with Lucy. I feel as though this is what humanity needs. People view the Devil as the true vessel of evil, but that in-fact, has been bestowed on us before we ever had a chance to be saved. \n\nGod. His power, his vision, his image, we are all God. Afraid of ourselves so we create a world around us that we can control and call it free will. ",

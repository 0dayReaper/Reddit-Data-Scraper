    "postText": "When somebody suggests you commit arson together, your reaction is most likely to differ based on the identity of that person. If anyone else had asked me to come along to burn down a building, I would have assumed it was a joke. However, being aware of Frankie Preston\u2019s barely suppressed murderous tendencies made me take his request quite seriously. Of course, three main questions presented themselves upon first consideration.\n\n\u201cWhat building?\u201d\n\n\u201cA small developmental factory owned by FunFlair.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you plan on burning it while there are still people inside?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly one, and that one deserves to burn alive.\u201d\n\nShelving my thoughts on that answer for the moment, I inquired as to when he was hoping to go about this endeavor. \n\n\u201cThe sooner the better. My sister\u2014you haven\u2019t met her\u2014found out that they\u2019re going to move sites in the near future, so if I want to take revenge on my old boss easily, I need to do it now. It won\u2019t be too difficult. I know the layout of the place really well, they can\u2019t have changed much these last three years. It\u2019s small, hidden but unprotected. A bunch of containers in some woods a couple hours from here. The human I hate most in the entire world is there, every night, working all alone.\u201d His shoulders twitched. \u201cI drove by the place a couple times, and I kept thinking about doing it, but I was too scared. Having you there would make all the difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would?\u201d I echoed.\n\n\u201cYes! Sunshine, you\u2019re strong. Amazingly so. I don\u2019t want you to feel like I\u2019m using you, but the thing is, I can\u2019t do this on my own. If you tell me to go away and never mention this again, I will. That I swear to God. Or whatever sadistic omnipotent being has put me on this world to suffer.\u201d He briefly glanced heavenward, or rather at the ceiling, then back at me. \u201cI can\u2019t hurt anybody, remember?\u201d\n\nI nodded along slowly. \u201cThis person, your old boss\u2026 what did they do to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cSimply put, she\u2019s why I hate everything.\u201d He spoke with an uncanny intensity, staring past me like he was miles away. \n\n\u201cWho is she?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer name is Philomena Wallis. She\u2019s the one who keeps sending people after me. She wants me back to do fuck knows what to me because she's still pissed I screwed her over.\" He paused. \"She did\u2014*does* horrible things. You'd want her dead, too.\"\n\n\"Why isn't she in prison?\"\n\n\"Nobody gets taken to prison if they're rich enough. Either way, what she does isn't technically illegal\u2026 and no one knows about it either. It's a tricky situation.\"\n\nI took a deep breath. \u201cDo you have a plan?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do. We\u2019ll go there at night, I\u2019ll slip in and make sure the door to Phil\u2019s workspace is locked, and then we\u2019ll douse the whole thing in gasoline.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll need me for that? It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019d be inflicting hurt directly. I mean, you wouldn\u2019t have to actually raise a hand to your boss, not physically. Or can you not do that either?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe risk lies rather within what could happen if she finds me.\u201d He rubbed his arm, a look of uncertainty crossing his features. \u201cI\u2019m different when I\u2019m around her. I can\u2019t help it, she\u2026 she can just walk all over me. She made me be this way. There\u2019s nothing to be done about it, except to get rid of her once and for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not following. She *made you* be this way? What do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly what I said!\u201d he snapped, only to shrink back and raise his hands. \u201cSorry! I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d\n\nI stared at him in silence for a beat. \u201cYou\u2019re terrified,\u201d I said.\n\nHe glanced at his chucks, then back at me, looking like he wanted to say something but didn\u2019t know what.\n\n\u201cSad, too,\u201d I added. \u201cSometimes, I can\u2019t tell what you think, so I apologize if I\u2019m reading this wrong\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to guess what\u2019s going on inside my head anyways,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m trying to rope you into again. It\u2019s like I didn\u2019t hear myself talk for a minute there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d\n\nHe raised a skeptical brow. \u201cI don\u2019t want to force you. I swear I don\u2019t. I *will* do this, and I\u2019d feel so much better if you came with, but if this is something you\u2019re gonna resent me for in the long run\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe long run?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean\u2014\u201d He started playing with his gum again. \u201cAre we not doing this? You really like me, I think?\u201d\n\n\u201c*I* think we shouldn\u2019t be talking about this in the same breath as committing lethal arson.\u201d I rubbed my nose before letting go of a long breath. \u201cIf I can\u2019t stop you from doing this, I\u2019ll at least make sure you come back out in one piece.\u201d *I wonder if this is how Nettie Peterson usually feels.*\n\nFrankie beamed. \u201cYou will? You\u2019re absolutely sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Here\u2019s the plan, I drop off what I bought for my savior human and then we can prepare; do what\u2019s needed. I don\u2019t want to put this off. The sooner it\u2019s over, the better.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefinitely,\u201d he agreed with an eager nod. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you right over.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. And Frankie\u2026 you know precisely how I feel about you.\u201d\n\nWe got on our way the following morning. The car ride lasted several hours, most of which I spent fast asleep stretched out on the backseat. It was a wonderful nap; I hardly felt any of the vehicle\u2019s movements, admittedly a credit to the server\u2019s abilities as a driver. Eventually, the road was getting too bumpy to ignore, and I drowsily lifted my head to find us pulling onto heavily wooded terrain. Upon noticing I was awake, Fran gave me a fleeting, quite obviously forced smile. After a few more minutes, we came to a halt on a clearing. I got out and produced a canister of gasoline from the trunk, handing it to Fran after opening the door for him. He looked strangely absent, gazing off into the distance with a vacant look in his eyes. He grabbed the offered canister and clutched it to his chest, almost like he was hugging it. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be going the rest of the way on foot, then?\u201d I inquired.\n\nHe nodded wordlessly. \n\nI couldn\u2019t hide my frown. The air around us was warm and fragrant, the moonlight shining through between the branches that seemed to reach out for us as we began walking. There was not even a hint of a breeze, and yet, a chill ran down my spine. My companion\u2019s demeanor was nothing short of uncomfortable; he seemed to suck the warmth out of the atmosphere around us, together with my initial confidence and the sweet scent of pine needles. His silence instilled in me a clammy sense of dread, and I couldn\u2019t shake it no matter how hard I tried. Normally, I would have probably appreciated the perfect calm and serenity of the lush forest around us, but seeing him in such obvious, unspoken distress drove away all my idyllic thoughts.\n\n\u201cThis seems like an odd place to hide a factory,\u201d I remarked, trying to open a conversation once more.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the point. You wouldn\u2019t go looking for a doll manufacturer in bum-fuck nowhere,\u201d he replied. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s strange to think about. What kind of shady stuff can a toy manufacturer even get up to? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I trust you when you say they\u2019re bad people, I just wish you\u2019d give me a little more information. I feel like I\u2019m not getting something here.\u201d\n\nHe let out a low hum. \u201cYou\u2026 are really innocent.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d I argued, affronted.\n\n\u201cNot in a bad way. I said innocent, not naive. I\u2019ve been cagey again, I know that, but the thing is, you\u2019ll see exactly what I was talking about when we get there. You\u2019ll understand everything, and to be honest, I\u2019m very afraid of what you\u2019ll think once you do.\u201d\n\nWe finally reached the building Fran had told me about. If it could indeed be called a building. It looked more like something that had been thrown together by a larva using Lego bricks. It was, as predicted, a bunch of containers lined up and stacked atop one another, small corridors and open metal staircases connecting them. It seemed to be almost entirely empty\u2014all the lights were out, except for a single one. From behind a window on the upper floor, filtered through gray blinds, a cool, bright glow shone down upon us. It bathed Frankie in its surreal luminescence that seemed completely out of place given our raw, natural surroundings. \n\n\u201cYou were right,\u201d I stated, tearing him from his rigor. \u201cSeems like there\u2019s only one person in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Phil,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI\u2019m certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen let\u2019s do this.\u201d\n\nFrankie detached himself from the canister, peeling it off his body like a piece of clothing. I took it from his hands while he walked over to the nearest door, reaching into his pocket to produce a set of shiny, slim tools. Despite the darkness, he set his fingers to work on the lock. It didn\u2019t take long at all for him to let out a satisfied sound, straightening up as he held the now open door for me. \u201cI\u2019m very skilled at lockpicking,\u201d he said lightly, by way of conversation.\n\nI couldn\u2019t hide the admiration in my gaze, and I gave him a proud smile that briefly caused his features to soften. I had not yet crossed the threshold when he grabbed me by the wrist, holding me back. \u201cOne more thing,\u201d he whispered, his voice suddenly ringing desperate again, \u201cyou won\u2019t like what we might see in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I answered. \u201cIt was implied.\u201d\n\nStepping forth into the dark room, the smell of plastic and coffee instantly hit my nose. Fran fumbled for a lightswitch before thinking better of it and turning on the flashlight he\u2019d brought. We were clearly in a breakroom; there was a table in the middle surrounded by chairs, an espresso machine in the corner and several calendars and posters taped to the walls. Unsuspecting. Frankie didn\u2019t comment, immediately moving across the cube and towards the door on the other side. It led out into a small corridor, improvised using more corrugated iron elements, and into another larger container. There was a desk with a computer in one corner and an empty operating table in the center. \n\nA large shelving unit occupied the entire left side of the room. A closer inspection revealed that it held all sorts of small parts, though what they were parts *of* was beyond me. Opening the plastic drawers at random, I glimpsed all sorts of metallic and silicone pieces, forming strange little\u2026 *thingies*.\n\n\u201cWhat is all this?\u201d I asked Frankie.\n\nHe had been standing by the operating table, staring at it with unblinking eyes. His expression was once more perfectly vacant. Not even his jaw was moving around his bubble gum. He didn\u2019t look up, and for a minute, I wondered if he\u2019d heard me at all. \u201cDoll parts,\u201d he suddenly answered, his voice lacking any inflection.\n\nI frowned, picking up one of the tiny metallic objects and inspecting it closely. I could see what he meant now\u2014it appeared to be a very small joint, perhaps for a finger. \u201cWhen you said FunFlair made dolls, I thought you meant these stiff little baby dolls. I didn\u2019t know they made them this detailed.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, they can be detailed alright.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this, like, a robotics thing? Can they move on their own, too?\u201d\n\nFrankie let out a sharp, mirthless laugh that was much too short. He fell completely silent again, and it felt as though the room had gotten colder. I bit my lip, placing the finger joint back in its box. I tentatively reached out to Fran and rested a hand on his upper arm, only for him to flinch, drawing away as if burned. \u201cD-don\u2019t touch me right now,\u201d he pleaded.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I breathed.\n\n\u201cNo, I am. Don\u2019t mind me, okay? Let\u2019s\u2014let\u2019s just go on.\u201d\n\nSo we did. Another makeshift corridor led us over into the next container. The beam of our flashlight cut through the darkness, revealing a sight that made me stop in my tracks. There were several bodies propped up in the corners of the room, bodies that I only realized on second glance were artificial. They were of roughly the same size as the average person, with fully formed arms, legs and everything. Their faces however were different. Most of them weren\u2019t even fully complete, the skin-like material not fully covering their heads and leaving the mechanical structures underneath uncovered. Their eyeballs\u2014sitting in hard plastic sockets and unframed by lids\u2014stared out at us blankly, utterly void and expressionless.\n\nCold dread began to seep into my bones, paralyzing me for a second before I managed to break from my stillness. Taking a step towards one of the lifeless figures, I bent down to get a closer look. Keeping my distance, I reached out a single finger to trace along one of the countless delicate wires peeking out from the soft patches of facial material. It was cool to the touch, making my skin crawl. I pulled back, turning to Frankie in bewilderment. \u201cWh-what is all this?\u201d I asked hesitantly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s them. That\u2019s the dolls.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes, I can see that but this\u2026 this is really, really unnerving.\u201d\n\nHe let out a strangled, mournful sound. \u201cI guess it is,\u201d he said eventually, his voice low and flat. He knelt down beside me, a little closer to the doll, and started fumbling around with the back of its neck, clearly looking for something. Finally, I heard a little click, followed by a whirring noise as the doll jerked up its arm. I squeaked, scrambling back on my hands and rear, only to find my back suddenly pressed up against the chest of another mannequin. I hadn\u2019t done a thing, but it instantly sprang to life; robotic fingers clamping down around both sides of my nape. The painfully fierce touch wiped away every last bit of my composure, and I let out a shriek that seemed to tear apart the relative silence. Frankie spun around to fix me with the beam of his flashlight, causing me to squeeze my eyes shut. My heart was hammering against my ribcage, seemingly exploding when the hands started pulling me closer against the lifeless, yet animate body.\n\nThe next thing I knew was that Fran had leapt forward and removed me from the doll\u2019s clutches with one swift, powerful yank. My chest was heaving and I couldn\u2019t suppress a low whimper when I pressed myself to his side, frantically glancing about my surroundings. My fangs were bared, but my racing pulse was admittedly overtaxing me. I couldn\u2019t seem to form any coherent thoughts. My flight-instinct was kicking in, further setting off my panicked response when I realized I might end up involuntarily jumping dimensions again.\n \nSuddenly, I felt Frankie\u2019s hand on my cheek, the gentle pressure tilting my head up to make me meet his gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d he said, his voice equal parts firm and understanding. The fog in my head lifted just a little.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to hurt you,\u201d he went on, his thumb stroking the curve of my outer ear. However he managed to convey such certainty when he himself had been so uneasy mere moments ago was beyond me, and yet, I found myself believing him. My breathing slowed and I hazarded a second glance at the doll I had bumped into. \n\nIt had stopped moving, its body having locked into an unnatural, almost feral-looking position. It was cowering on all fours, its torso lowered and its head up. Its neck was bent at such an extreme angle that it was approaching the comical.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d I whispered, the curse word escaping me before I could stop myself.\n\n\u201cSome of them have to be activated manually, others can be turned on just by touch. I remember that,\u201d Frankie replied. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be afraid of them, though. Even if it\u2019s hard to believe considering\u2026 well.\u201d He gestured at the oddly crouching doll at our feet.\n\n\u201cSomething\u2019s very wrong here,\u201d I muttered, unable to tear my eyes off the lifeless, incomplete face. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know they made toys like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not for children,\u201d Frankie said, his eyes glazing over once more.\n\n\u201cAre they, like, robots? Do they know what they\u2019re doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if they\u2019re lucky, they don\u2019t.\u201d He paused. \u201cThey\u2019re not made to think.

But while I may not like it, i have to respect your decisions. \n\nI am surprised that you haven't caught on yet, and I'm not sure if it's wrong for me to be the one to tell you this, but Frankie (and his siblings) was created in the \"factory\" you two are about to justifiably incinerate. The big question remaining is how did he and his siblings gain sentience and how did Frankie help them all escape? Also, can he be physically modified in the future to correct a certain missing anatomical feature that's preventing him from engaging in a particular act of physical intimacy? And can he have the part of his programming that prevents him from physically harming other living beings modified so that he can actually help defend both you and himself? \ud83e\udd14\n\nAnyways, good luck and I hope that your mission is successful and that you both escape unharmed!",

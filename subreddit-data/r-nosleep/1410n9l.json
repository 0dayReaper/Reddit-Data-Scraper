    "postText": "I recently came across a post about an [expat who participated in a night wedding.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13zxeq5/wedding_nightmares_night_wedding/) After reading the accounts I began to do research on my own. Not because I believe in any of that stuff. I'm a magician after all. Illusion is my bread and butter. And I can detect trickery better than most. Which in my line of work has its benefits. But I've discovered that old traditions are the best places to pick up new techniques. Old ways that are new to others that delight and even scare people. Because, if I can make them afraid. Make them look away. For even a second. I can pull off some astounding magic.\n\nMy gig at the cruise line was coming to an end as we neared the port of Shanghai. And for my last set of shows, I'd normally start to include my greatest feats in order to leave a lasting impression on my audience. Instead, I took a gamble and developed a new act to showcase , which I called \"The Sneaky Bride\", it involved a mannequin in a wedding dress, a beautiful train, veil, flowers on the ground - the whole nine yards some would say. The trick was that the bride would sneak bites as my assistants who are dressed as servers pass by with their trays.\n\nI begin the trick by placing a mannequin center stage for all to see so that they know it's a dummy. I show them there are no holes, and the entire thing is solid. Then we dress it up and set the stage for a wedding. And with a bit of lighting, another assistant switches places with the mannequin and periodically move as she is being fed under the veil. We later changed it to more slight of hand techniques as the assistant complained she wasn't able to chew fast enough as the items of course had to get larger and larger for comedic effect.\n\nAt the end we even invited the unmarried men up to the stage and then threw out a fake bouquet, and watched them clamber over each other in good fun to catch it. The act was an instant hit and had the crowd roaring every night. Which was why I decided to take a firsthand look at the original and see if there were any other staging techniques I could learn from this old tradition.\n\nAfter some research online, I was able to get a relatively good idea of where the tradition was still practiced. So I booked the next flight out to begin my quest for a real night wedding.\n\nUpon arrival at my hotel, I asked the concierge for information about the local practice.\n\n\"Yes. I know of this one. We practice it often for children who were taken too early.\"\n\n\"But they are all scams?\"\n\nThe concierge smiled, \"In most cases the pouches mean no harm, and they're simply for families who want to provide peace for themselves and to complete a lasting tradition. Sometimes the dowries are quite lucrative as well, and it is the families who are scammed by those who go and collect these ghost wives as concubines. We call it a blue procession for the trail of ghosts the husband leaves behind whenever he leaves.\" The man leans in, \"But between you and me? They're mostly all scams.\"\n\nI laughed, and I can't stress this next part enough, tip your concierge! Which I did. \"Thank you, and also. Do you know where I could get a good start on finding more information about these ghost dowries? Or even find one of these pouches myself?\"\n\n\"The temple down this first street to the left, about half a kilometer, would be a good place to start. But finding a pouch is a bit more difficult as they pop up sporadically. However, if traditions are to be believed it is the pouch who chooses the spouse.\"\n\nI thanked him again and began to make my way through the early morning rush toward the temple. The streets were lined with open markets full of fruits and vegetables from local farmers, which were common in the morning in this part of the world. They would disappear before the afternoon and then return again to sell wares at night when it was cooler. It made the city feel as if it were breathing as the locals rose and ebbed outside with day and night.\n\nOn my way, I searched the ground and around alleys for loose pouches. But I had no such luck by the time I arrived at the temple. Large red pillars that were thicker than any tree I've personally had the pleasure of meeting held up the high ceiling. Inside, the locals were already starting to disperse as the work hours were amongst us. Which left me nearly alone in this temple at about 8:00 in the morning.\n\nA monk or priest was kneeling on a mat in front of a wooden shrine, throwing pieces of wood in the shape of dumplings on the floor. I waited patiently for him to finish. Taking in the sights and the delicate features of the temple. When he rose I approached him.\n\n\"You don't speak English by any chance do you?\"\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\"What about the middle tongue?\" I asked in Mandarin.\n\n\"Oh,\" he seemed surprised. \"Yes. How may I be of assistance?\"\n\n\"What were you doing just now?\"\n\nHe held out his hand and showed me two red wooden pieces that were, with closer inspection, in the shape of moons. \"Jiaobei,\" he told me. \"We use these to seek divine guidance.\"\n\n\"How does it work?\"\n\nThe monk shows me the two sides, one was smooth and flat, the other side rounded. \"You ask a question and then throw it on the ground. One block flat and one block round, means yes. Both blocks showing round means no. Or depending on the question. Anger from the Gods. Or crying in sadness as it is commonly known. And finally, both blocks showing flat means laughter. Which could mean a number of things.\" He hands them to me, \"You throw it three times to get a better answer.\"\n\n\"I'm guessing if it's the same all three times, the answer is definitive?\"\n\nThe monk nodded.\n\n\"Am I a good...\"\n\n\"Ah ah ah, in silence.\"\n\nI didn't want my first question to be too convoluted or difficult. So I kept it simple and asked if I was a good magician. Then I threw the Jiaobei on the floor. It clattered and rolled on its rounded back, showing two flat sides.\n\nThe monk smiled.\n\n\"That usually happens the first time anyone tries Jiaobei. But in my experience, it generally means you asked a pure question.\"\n\n\"What happens if I didn't ask a pure question and it came back as angry?\"\n\n\"The gods will remember it. They will remember you.\"\n\n\"No bad first impression then huh,\" I whispered under my breath. \"Okay. Do I need to throw it two more times or can I ask a different question?\"\n\n\"You may ask a different question or throw it twice more.\"\n\n\"What is my name?\" I threw it on the floor. And to my surprise, as the ends are pointed and difficult to balance, one of the damn things stood tall and erect.\n\nThe monk bowed to the pieces. \"Truly you have been picked by the gods to be answered. Lijiao or a standing answer like this is uncommonly rare. The gods generally choose to laugh at a nonsensical question. And often get angry if you throw it two more times. And rarely do they ever answer ones asked aloud.\"\n\nI bent forward, skeptical, though a temple this was, at how the thing worked. In my head I could only think that the switchboard guy was quick on his feet. But looking around I couldn't find any cameras. Though in this day an age, they're made smaller than a fly. So it was difficult to tell. I picked up the pieces, feeling for any sense of magnetism, but there were none.\n\nI asked one last question before I left that day. I asked their gods, would I find the real deal? And I threw it on the ground three times. All three times it came up yes. But for two months I scoured the city, and the country side. And I did chance upon several pouches. Some were obviously scams but never would it be the real thing. Usually the scammy ones were noticeable and always in the city. There'd be a pouch laying on the sidewalk, filled with bills for people passing by. But I observed that if a local went to go pick it up, two or three men from around the corner would come and threaten him to put it back. But if a foreigner picked it up, an old man or woman would come and start calling them son before leading them away.\n\nThere were of course others that were genuinely following tradition. I chanced upon several of them and was married several times. But each one was playful almost. And performed by their parents in the day. Leaving me with several small bags of pocket change, a good dinner, as I went on my way.\n\nDuring one of these fake night weddings I even saw a child playfully munching on a corn cob in the corner under one of the tables as I fed the effigy they constructed of my fake bride. Which was when I think I decided to call it quits. Believing that I'd never find the real thing. Not that I hadn't learned a great deal as a lot of tradition can be translated by me into performance. Which helped me flesh out 'The Sneaky Bride' act further. So all in all, this was time well spent.\n\nMy visa was also coming to an end and I for the last few days I had mostly been enjoying the sights, the city, and their way of life. On my last day, as I was leaving from a faraway eatery that the concierge had recommended, I saw a red pouch made of silk with a thick yarn around its throat, stuffed full of money. I looked around and didn't see a single person there, nothing except flat farmland and water gullies for miles.\n\nOdd, I thought to myself, as the pouch looked truly abandoned.\n\nFor a second I played with the idea of picking it up. Wondering if somehow a relative of the deceased would pop up magically next to me and I could change the world of magic by studying their technique. But I didn't want to spend my few remaining hours chasing ghosts. So I kept walking.\n\nI got back to the city and spent the remainder of my day eating and drinking, meeting new friends at the bar, newfound lads who I invited a hundred times to visit me in Los Angeles one day. Who all agreed that if fate ever brought us back together we would drink until the sun rose. So yeah, I was fairly drunk when I got back to my hotel room, and didn't believe what I saw when I opened the door. It was a red pouch sitting on my coffee table.\n\n\"Someone's trying to play a trick on me,\" I accused. \"They must have heard me talking at the bar.\" I circled the table studying the pouch. Any magician worth his smoke, likes a good bag. So there was no doubt to me that this was the same one I saw earlier by the side of the road from the restaurant that I was recommended, I thought to myself. Which made me start putting two and two together. \"It must be the concierge. He's the one who sent me out that far.\" I laughed and picked up the bag, even though I knew the rules. I opened it and thumbed through the bills. \"It's much more than what I've been tipping him. Much more.\" Curious, I wondered what he would have done if I didn't return this to him. It must have been quite a few months worth of wages. I threw the bag up in the air and caught it as if I were juggling before I tossing it onto my nightstand. \"I'm going to let him sweat for a little bit and pretend I didn't find it tomorrow as I check out,\" I mused as I went to go take a shower.\n\nI opened the door and felt the words stick to the roof of my mouth as the bag appeared on the counter next to the sink. I shot a glance back to the nightstand and indeed the bag I had just thrown on there was missing.\n\n\"This is a good fucking trick. That, or I'm drunker than I thought.\" I started questioning did I somehow fall asleep beforehand? Or walked into the bathroom and put it there as I schemed? Had I somehow in my drunken state done something without realizing it? No. That couldn't be it. I touched my chest to check my heart rate and put my fingers on my face. A bit flushed, but heart rate adequate. I was fine for the most part. Just drunk.\n\nI looked at the pouch on the counter, and peered gingerly into the bathroom as if I've never stepped foot in one, before deciding to grab the bag and close the door. \"Okay,\" I said loudly. \"Whoever's doing this. Come on out.\" Of course no one appeared, not that I expected them to because the credo I lived by is that a good magician never reveals his trick.\n\n\"Okay, let's see how good you guys really are.\" I went over to my closet and placed the pouch on the shelf. Closing the door. Then I went back to the bathroom and opened the door. It was empty. I checked the nightstand drawer, mpty. I looked all over, and it was still mty. I breathed a sigh and went over to the closet door, \"I guess you're just a bag after all.\" Except when I looked inside. MT.\n\nI stumbled backwards and looked around, glancing at the ceiling corners in case someone had crawled up there. And even looked under the bed. But there was no one else here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt my chest tighten as I tried to make sense of what was happening. \"Its got to be the walls I reasoned.\" And so for the next half hour I scoured the entire room with my hands, pushing, pressing, pulling anywhere and everywhere I could. Using all my years of experience to figure out what was going on. But there was nothing to find.\n\nI couldn't stay in that room another minute so I rushed outside and nearly stepped on it! The bag! It was right at the foot of my doorstep.\n\nMy mind tried to wrap around how that was possible, \"It's got to be a dupe. They've got more than one bag. I've been had, that has to be it. And the furniture inside, they have secret compartments. God, they really put a lot of effort into this,\" I laughed. \"I have to know how this trick is done.\" So I opened the pouch and pulled out the note inside.\n\nThe notes generally contained their name, their current would-be age (she was 20 this year, older than most), what time they were born (8:07), a picture if they had one (she did), and how old they were when they died (5). If the deceased were a bit older, perhaps a tidbit from their family is included about their personality. But most importantly, it always contained their address.\n\nI looked at my watch, it was late and my flight was in the morning but perhaps I could still make it. So I gathered the rest of my things, my luggage, the mannequin for my act, and my bags of tricks in case I needed to go to the airport right after. \"Come on,\" I yelled out loud to my pranksters. \"Let's go see what other tricks you have up your sleeve.\"\n\nI went down to the lobby and had the front desk call me a cab. I looked around for the concierge but he was nowhere to be found. So I left a note. And then left.\n\nThe cab drove until the city faded away. We were practically on the other side of the island by the time its tires skipped to a stop. I got out and knocked on the giant half circle doors of the address. I noticed that we were deep in the countryside. There were hardly any lights dotting the night.\n\nI knocked several more times before I heard shuffling behind the door. And then it opened. An old man stood in front of me in his drawers.\n\n\"What do you want,\" he asked angrily. \"Do you know what time it is?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for disturbing you at such a late hour. But,\" I pulled out the pouch. And his eyes widened up.\n\n\"Meju-eh. You're back.\" He looked at me up and down. \"What are you supposed to be,\" he asked but then shook his head. \"No, no. Come in. Come in, please.\"\n\n\"I don't have much time,\" I told him. \"I have to leave in the morning.\"\n\n\"Sit, sit.\" He ushered me to a chair in the courtyard.\n\nI placed the bag on the table next to it, \"I have a flight in the morning, so if we're going to do this. We have to do it now.\"\n\nInstead of fighting me, he nodded, \"Yes. I agree. I don't have much time either. And Meju-eh is older than most ghost brides. The bull demon might not let her through his gates if she gets any older, any stronger. And then she'll be a husbandless spinster for eternity.\" He ushered around, \"We don't have many living relatives either. So it shouldn't be too troublesome to hurry this along.\" He called into the house and a young woman came out, \"This is my granddaughter. Ah-ahn. Meju-eh's older sister. They were close as children.\"\n\nAh-ahn was quite beautiful. I almost couldn't take my eyes off of her.\n\n\"Go and start preparations and rouse anyone you can get a hold of. We must have the wedding tonight. Even if it isn't grand as I would like.\"\n\n\"Will we make it in time,\" I asked. \"It's a lot of work for one person. Perhaps I could help?\"\n\nThe old man nodded, \"That's a good idea. But forgive me, I must retire for now. Or else have no energy for the wedding.\" He turned to his granddaughter, \"Fetch me when the preparations are ready.\" As he left us alone in the courtyard.\n\n\"What can I do,\" I asked her.\n\n\"We're going to need flowers for decoration.\"\n\nI pulled a rose out from behind her ear, \"I happen to have a case of these on hand at all times.\" I put the flower in her hair.\n\nShe smiled, \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"What else?\"\n\n\"Um, we already have tables for family gatherings. There should be enough food in the freezers that we can just heat up. I need to call my aunt to come help. And wake up some of the kids. Also...we kind of need a statue of some sort, as a stand-in for my sister.\"\n\n\"Statue? I think I have just the thing.\"\n\nHours went by and it was the dead of the night, but watching all the people bustling around the courtyard, the kids in excited whispers, you'd never guess that all of us should have been sleeping. Soon the tables were set, the food was hot, even the decorations were strung, and I had procured my mannequin from my luggage and a few of the menfolk were putting it together inside the main living room.\n\nSeveral times I found myself laughing and having a good time with the others, although chasing that hen made me look absolutely ridiculous, and several times I bumped into Ah-ahn and we would talk and exchange a few words. In the beginning she talked mostly about her sister. How she was troublesome as a child. Always hiding things. I told her about the pouch appearing and disappearing in my hotel. And we both had a good laugh. Eventually we talked about ourselves. I learned she wanted to get away from here, \"To see the world,\" she told me. The more we talked the closer we got. I could feel it. Soon we were bumping into each other just to feel our bodies touch. But before anything else transpired the wedding preparations were complete.\n\nThe old man was retrieved from his bedroom and everyone gathered outside in the courtyard, looking into the main living room. There was a wooden shrine in the back of the room and the mannequin had been traditionally dressed in red. From an old box the grandfather retrieved several personal items that belonged to Meju. And I was then asked to enter the living room.\n\nThe grandfather said a few words, and then gave us his blessing. Ah-ahn handed me a bowl of sticky rice ball soup. I had been through this process before and knew what to do. I ate one of the pink balls and then went to go feed my new bride.\n\nNow I've traveled with this mannequin for some time. Seen it at a dozen of my own shows. Slept with it in the room. Knew that it was in fact a dummy for all intents and purposes. However, as I started moving my spoon toward it. I swear I saw its chest rise as if it were breathing.\n\nI couldn't tell if it was from the alcohol ebbing away from earlier or a trick of the light. But even its shoulders looked softer than usual. My hand started shaking as it got closer to her mouth. It was like watching an out of body experience as the spoon inched under her veil. And then the CRUNCH. It scared the fucking shit out of me. I looked around hoping to see some kid in the corner playing a dumb joke. But there was none. And I didn't believe what I was seeing even as the veil started moving as her jaws chewed the sticky material back and forth.\n\n\"No way,\" I shook. \"There's just no way.\" My hand was so close to the veil. \"Oh God. Please. I have to know how this is done.\" I ripped off the veil.\n\nMeju looked very much like her picture. But older. And then older. And older. As if her face was starting to rot away as the plastic started melting away. People behind me screamed. The lightbulbs we had strung popped. Kids were running around and the grandfather fell to the floor clutching his heart.\n\nI backed away, the spoon clattering to the ground as I watched the mannequin crick and crack as its arms and legs bent in a tangled mess until it was walking on all fours!\n\nThe thing bent down and grabbed the grandfather and started chewing!\n\nI turned around and saw the other guests were piling out of the courtyard. The tables were upturned and only the dim crescent light of the moon bore down on us. Everyone was screaming as they tried to get out. I ran and bumped into Ah-ahn. She whirled, terrified at first before realizing it was me. She snarled, \"You never! Ever! Look at the bride before it's time!\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry! I didn't know. I thought it was a trick!\"\n\nShe grabbed her face, her nails leaving streaks behind as she clawed at her skin, \"Now she's going to kill every living blood relative. And then you.\" Ah-ahn laughed manically. \"She's going to torture you!\"\n\nThe people kept pushing around us until we got separated. Her final words still ringing in my ears as I took to the dirt road outside and started running. I ran for nearly a mile before I spotted a cab sitting outside of someone's house. I banged on their door and then begged them to take me to the airport. Throwing at them all the money from the dowry.\n\nWhen I arrived at the airport I hurried through the TSA. Relieved at the lights and normal looking people. I boarded my flight. Tapping my foot nervously the entire time, staring out the small squarish window as we prepared to take off. The sun was starting to rise as the engine roared. I took one last look at the island as we flew away. Still shaking at what I had just done.\n\nMy mind reeled in the cabin as I heard two knocking noises, they sounded oddly familiar, and for a second I thought that Meju had finished with her family and had somehow come aboard. But then I realized the noise was coming from my carry-on. I reached inside and pulled out two red shaped crescents that the Monk at the temple had given me. And if I've ever needed any form of divine guidance this was it.\n\nSo right there in the tiny aisle. I asked the gods if I had escaped and threw the Jiaobei.\n\nNo.\n\nI asked the gods if I would be safe.\n\nNo.\n\nI asked them would Meju kill me.\n\nBoth flat.\n\nBoth flat.\n\nBoth flat.\n\n[s](https://www.reddit.com/r/CornerCornea/)",

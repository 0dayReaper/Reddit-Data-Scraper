    "postText": "(Edit - Updated because of last nights dream....and now i'm going back to Sauna Club)\n\nAll I wanted to do was lose a little weight.\n\nI\u2019m not, and never have been skinny. The problem is I\u2019m short. If you\u2019re taller you can hide those extra pounds all over the place before people start to notice, but for me it seems to take no time at all to start piling it. A few moments of indiscretion\u2026a few pints after work, a few snacks on the commute, a few takeaways here and there, and suddenly nothing fits as well.I don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m making excuses\u2026but it\u2019s my wife\u2019s fault. We\u2019ve recently found out she\u2019s pregnant (yay.) and it turns out that makes a man body start releasing sympathy hormones so that you gain weight as well! I always knew that at some point I\u2019d be settling into a bit of a dad bod but for now I\u2019m not going down without a fight. Hell, I\u2019ve got a gym membership. The least I could do is give it a go.\n\nBut here is where my weight loss journey gets a little\u2026strange.I set an alarm for 7am. I thought \u2018better to get it done before the day gets in the way\u2019. And honestly the experience was FINE. I didn\u2019t hate it anyway near as much as I was expecting. The pool was much busier than I thought it would be. Turns out 7.30am \u2013 8.30am is absolutely peak time for the work hard play hard gym freaks who like to get in a pre- business swim in! I managed about 30 minutes of breaststroke before calling it a day. Even in the slow lane I couldn\u2019t help but feel I was holding up traffic. 3 old dears behind me that I could feel rolling their eyes at the end of every lap.  \nIt wasn\u2019t great but it was a start and I thought I\u2019d earned myself a little treat. The real reason I\u2019d come\u2026the sauna. I\u2019ve always loved a sauna. It\u2019s one of the few things that made this extortionate membership worthwhile. Those Scandi\u2019s get it. I don\u2019t know about the whole male female segregation thing, but is there anything more relaxing that slowly boiling yourself with a group of sweaty strangers?  \nUnfortunately after some googling one night my wife told me that sauna\u2019s are so hot that they stop your balls functioning properly. So for as long as we were trying - that was that.  \nNow the deed is done and though and I can finally get back to business.  \nMy wife laughs at me, but when we first bought our house it had a little shed at the back and for a while I was determined to turn it into a sauna\u2026another one of my \u2018half baked projects that I never see through the completion\u2019.  \nI hung up my towel and entered the sauna. It took my eyes a moment to adjust in the dim, steam filled room to realise that there were a few others in there already.  \nIt isn\u2019t a big room. Maybe 3 square meters at a push. With three levels to sit on, ascending like big wooden steps.  \nThis\u2019ll sound stupid but I forgot how hot they were. It was like entering an oven (I assume). Like I was immediately uncomfortably hot. I climbed up a level and felt the heat intensify again and knew that I wasn\u2019t ready for the highest step. I\u2019d actually have preferred to have remained on the lowest step but for some stupid reason I didn\u2019t want these strangers to knew that I could handle the sauna like a pro.  \nI sat down and started to bake, trying to work out what number was showing on the thermometer. Did that say 80? Too cold for Fahrenheit but surely waaaay too hot for centigrade?  \nI made a mental promise that I would wait for at least one of these strangers to leave before me. Unfortunately they all seemed deeply settled in conversation and in no rush to go anywhere.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the Wim Hof method\u201d  \n\u201cHere we go again.\u201d  \n\u201cWell it\u2019s worth repeating. Wim. Is. The man!\u201d  \n\u201cWho?\u201d giggled a new voice.  \n\u201cWim\u2026the ice man!\u201d  \n\u201cIce man?\u201d  \n\u201cWell there\u2019s more to him than that, but that\u2019s how he\u2019s known. His thing is all mind over matter. Get your breathing right and the body is capable of all kinds of things. Cold plunges into a lakes in the middle of winter in Russia, fucking\u2026100 mile runs\u2026withstanding extreme heat\u2026you just need to get your mind right and the rest follows\u201d  \n\u201cHere here\u201d echoed every voice in the sauna. This sudden group chorus took me by surprise. What had I walked into?  \n\u201cNo work today then my friend?\u201d There was an awkward pause and when I looked up I realised that the question was directed at me.  \n\u201cOh me?\u201d  \n\u201cYes mate. No work?\u201d  \n\u201cer no. Well\u2026yeah but\u2026I\u2019m self employed so\u2026whenever really\u201d   \nThe man who seemed to be holding court smiled a knowing smile \u201cGood for you mate. Nothing beats being your own boss.\u201d I took him in for the first time. An older guy, probably pushing into his late sixties. Body like a barrel and the veiny legs of a triathlete. The kind of retiree who looked like they\u2019d decided to take their health seriously. \u201cSo\u2026have you sought us out?\u201d He asked slowly, seeming to test the water with his question.  \n\u201cPardon?\u201d I laughed, certain I\u2019d misheard him.  \n\u201cThe Sauna Club\u2026are you here to join us today?\u201d  \n\u201cThe Sauna Club?\u201d  \n\u201cAh\u201d A cheeky grin flickered across the face of the four strangers.  \n\u201cA happy accident then I guess\u201d chimed in the old lady sat nearest the coals. \u201cMy names Jen darling. What\u2019s yours?\u201d Jen had kind eyes and no hair and a complexion that spoke to a rough couple of years that I hoped were now behind her.  \n\u201cMike\u201d I replied. I tried to sound friendly but also final. I really hate conversations with strangers at the best of times and I certainly hadn\u2019t come here to join \u2018sauna club\u2019.  \n\u201cNice to meet you Mike. I\u2019m Andy, opposite we\u2019ve got Lydia and Sak.\u201d The retiree directs my attention to the bench opposite where I can just about make out two others in the swirling mists.Sak is probably a few years younger than me and in the absolute physical prime of his life. He has a body that I\u2019m sure has had some chemical assistance and his body is riddled with tattoo\u2019s. He looked like the kind of man who knew a thing or two about mixed martial arts. Lydia\u2026well if I\u2019m being honest I\u2019d already noticed Lydia and I was trying hard not to stare. Lydia was a 10 and she knew it. The amount of skin on display was verging on pornographic. Just looking at her felt like I was cheating on my wife.  \n\u201cand we are Sauna Club\u201d smiled Jen again. Like that explained anything. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing official.\u201d  \n\u201cThere\u2019s no joining fee\u201d Andy let out a laugh that was more like a bark.  \n\u201cWe meet when we all feel we need\u2026a visit\u201d Everyone nodded at this. I\u2019m not naturally gifted at conversation but this felt more obtuse than usual.  \n\u201cNow\u2019s ideal\u201d Jen continued. \u201cThe sweet spot of the day. 8.45am\u2026most people are off to work, but too early for mums and babies so it\u2019s just us\u2026\u201d  \n\u201cRetiree\u2019s\u201d chimed in Andy.  \n\u201cStudents\u201d added Lydia.  \n\u201cI\u2019m a personal trainer\u201d Sak added awkwardly \u201cI just haven\u2019t clocked in yet\u201d  \n\u201cLess likely to get disturbed\u201d. A quick glance outside told me she was right. There seemed to have been a mass pool exodus and now all that was left were a few stragglers. Even the life guards seemed to have clocked off for a bit.  \n\u201cWe\u2019ve sort of unofficially become the Sauna Club. What about you dear?\u201d  \n\u201cOh\u2026I\u2019m just here to\u2026\u201d I stopped. Jen\u2019s face was still smiling sweetly, willing me to go on, but I realised I didn\u2019t quite understand what she was asking\u2026and once I\u2019d opened my mouth I realised I didn\u2019t really know how much I wanted to tell these strangers\u2026but it was too late. I\u2019d started so I had to finish. Whatever came out my mouth next was either going to be over sharing or just sounded stupid.\u201cGo on mate\u201d said Andy coachingly.\u201cI\u2019m just here to er\u2026lose a bit of weight\u201d   \nI looked at Lydia when I said it. I don\u2019t know why and I wished I hadn\u2019t. She gave me this shit-eating sympathy grin and I hated myself and my body all over again.  \n\u201cWell you\u2019ve come to the right place\u201d Andy rallied. \u201cPeople underestimate the Sauna as just a \u2018end of work out treat\u2019 but this is where the magic happens\u201d Another weird cultish nod and murmur of approval from Andy\u2019s gathered congregation.\u201cThis is where jockeys come before a big race, where boxers come to shed those few final pounds before a fight. It\u2019s crazy what we carry around in water weight\u201d  \n\u201cYeah but-\u201d  \n\u201cNo man. It\u2019s no small thing. You come and sit here a few times a week, I promise you\u2019ll notice a difference. But if you come and join us\u2026join Sauna club\u2026\u201dAnother grin\u2026a grin that if I wasn\u2019t mistaken was erring on the side of\u2026  \n\u201cIt\u2019ll change your life\u201d Lydia drooled in a voice that was no way near as hot as her body.  \n\u201cIt\u2019ll save your life\u201d nodded Jen sadly.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026fucking something\u201d Mumbled Sak. From the corner.  \n\u201cWe forget but\u2026Sauna\u2019s are ancient magic Mike. Ancient magic. From Nordic mages, creating smoke houses to commune with the gods, to Native American\u2019s using fire pits to see into other times and places.\u201d  \n\u201cOkay\u201d I nodded, thinking this would be a good time to make my exit. It had all become a little more intense than I\u2019d planned on and besides, I was proper sweating by now.  \n\u201cThey are thin places Mike. Know what I mean?\u201d  \n\u201cNo\u201d I stood up, aware that I was leaving behind a sweat print of my butt cheeks and trying not to feel too embarrassed about that.  \n\u201cPlaces where\u2026in the right conditions\u2026we can do something extraordinary. Ask for\u2026the things we really want\u2026really need.\u201d There was no murmuring now. Andy, Jen, Sak and Lydia were looking at me as if they believed in this spiritual shit with all their hearts. Their eyes pleading with me to understand it.  \n\u201cSo what do you want Mike?\u201d  \n\u201cI just wanted to lose a little weight\u2026I should get going.\u201d  \nAndy stands and pushes me back to sitting. It\u2019s friendly but firm. It\u2019s an invitation and a challenge.  \n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna get started now Mike. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here. And if you don\u2019t want to stay I won\u2019t force you\u2026but if you give us 30 minutes of your time and it\u2019ll change your life. I promise.\u201d I looked around exasperated, limping searching for a easy way out but the truth was that Andy had peaked my interest.  \n\u201cFine\u201d  \n\u201cGood\u201d Andy smiled and the rest of the room smiled with him. Lydia shuffled closer to me on the benches and reached over to take my hand.  \n\u201cYou won\u2019t regret it\u201d she sounded like ever yoga teacher on every home yoga video I\u2019ve ever seen my wife do\u2026but beneath the words there was something else. Something sincere and\u2026scared.Also her breasts are unreal and leaning over like this I couldn\u2019t help but drink in an eyeful. Despite my better judgement, this was when I decided I was in it for whatever the so called \u2018sauna club\u2019 had planned. I decided to stay.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to think we\u2019re nuts Mike because what I\u2019m gonna say next\u2026it goes waaaaay beyond hippy-dippy gym-lad pseudo-science shit. What I\u2019m going to say next makes no sense at all!\u201d I had already stayed way longer than I\u2019d intended and I was now really starting to struggle with the heat. I was starting to pant without even speaking and I could feel my heart beating in my chest. I hoped Andy\u2019s little demonstration wasn\u2019t going to last much longer.\u201cThe only way for you to understand is to be part of it\u2026if that\u2019s cool?\u201d  \n\u201cI\u2019m actually\u2026I\u2019m pretty cooked\u2026\u201d  \n\u201cJust breath mate. In and out. 5 minutes from now you\u2019ll never be the same again.\u201d Lydia squeezed my hand again and nodded\u2026like it would be awful if I left now and carried on just being the same chubby loser I am.  \n\u201cWe think there\u2019s rules to this, but I won\u2019t lie Mike. We\u2019re working this out as we go along.\u201d  \n\u201cWhat\u2026rules?\u201d I gasped, trying to wipe sweat out of my hand but just moving it around.  \n\u201cFirst off. No matter you do, never stay longer than the timer.\u201d And with that he dramatically rotated the 15 minute egg timer on the wall. \u201cNext\u2026More heat, more smoke.\u201d  \n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d It came out as a whimper \u201cI really can\u2019t\u201d Lydia shuffled closer and moved her hand to my knee and I completely lost track of what I was doing and what the fuck I\u2019d stumbled into.  \n\u201cSorry mate, the heat is key. One more scoop for each person in the Sauna at the time. And then something all together for luck.\u201d Andy picked up the large wooden ladle from the bucket by the coals and poured over the first scoop of water. The room was immediately filled with a loud hissing sound and a brand new cloud of thick white smoke. I lost sight of all of Andy\u2019s torso and head, but watched his arm reach out and pass the ladle to Jen.Quick on her feet for such an old lady, Jen swapped places with Andy and added her scoop to the coals. The hissing intensified and before I knew it all I could see was white.Lydia\u2019s hand on my knee had started a gentle circling action. I could hear motion in the room and then another hiss. I assumed Sak had added his ladle to the coals.  \nLydia\u2019s hand disappeared and I felt the steam by my side shift to fill the void where she had just been. Another hiss. The wall of white steam was so thick now that it almost felt solid. I was losing all sense of where I was, even though I hadn\u2019t moved. I knew in my head that 4 short steps would take me to the glass door and back to pool side, but that seemed a million miles away. Even looking down I couldn\u2019t see my nipples any more. The heat was unbearable. My eyes felt like sand paper and whenever I breathed in there was a sensation of burning that travelled straight up my nose.  \n\u201cOne more Mike\u2026just walk towards my voice.\u201d Don\u2019t ask me why\u2026Maybe it was because I couldn\u2019t see my lumpy body and I was actually enjoying that\u2026maybe it was because I must have sweat out nearly half my body weight by now\u2026MAYBE it was because of the semi I was sporting in my swimming trunks that I couldn\u2019t just up and leave\u2026but I walked towards Andy\u2019s voice. Through the smoke I saw his hand clasped around the wooden ladle. He\u2019d already filled it for me. I took hold and felt him guide me towards the coals. Something about the moment felt\u2026pure\u2026ceremonial even\u2026which feels stupid to say about anything at a local leisure centre but Andy had been right. There was something primal about this moment\u2026the world did feel thin here.   \nI poured.   \nOne final hiss. Smoke on smoke on smoke until nothing existed any more. Nothing but an insufferable heat that was smothering me\u2026and I loved it. I knew I needed to leave soon or I might actually collapse but suddenly I didn\u2019t feel like leaving. The heat soothed me. Hands appeared on my shoulders. Both sides. Impossible to say whose.  \n\u201cGood. Now\u2026face forwards and spit. With whatever moisture you have left. Spit on the coals.\u201d          \nIt was too hot for questions. The only thing for it was to spit. I gathered whatever spittle I could in my arid mouth and spat forwards. 5 pathetic pops as we all found our mark and then silence. All of us gathered around the coals waiting for something to happen in a perfect white veil of steam. I wondered why the life guard wasn\u2019t coming over to open the door when this was clearly not safe behaviour in the steam room. I wondered what it would look like now to open the door and let this flood of steam pour out across the pool.   \n\u201cWhat now?\u201d I rasped. My voice was so starved for moisture that it came out like no noise I\u2019d ever made before.  \nThere was no reply and I realised there was no longer any hands on my shoulders. \u201cAndy?\u201d a sudden fear settled into my thumping heart. It wasn\u2019t just that I couldn\u2019t hear them. I was certain that none of them were with me anymore. But that wasn\u2019t possible. The only way out was the door to the pool and if they\u2019d left I\u2019d have felt the temperature change in a heart beat. It was too hot. Too hot to be here alone. Too hot to be playing whatever stupid game we\u2019d started. This was how people died. I didn\u2019t want my pregnant wife to read that her stupid fat husband had died at the local leisure centre because he\u2019d sat in a sauna too long and left her kid without a dad!   \nI reached out towards the door and felt\u2026nothing. I took another step forwards. Slowly for fear of touching the coals, but still nothing. I circled my arms either side of me, moving forwards and backwards, quicker now, desperate to feel anything. But it was as if the four wooden walls of the sauna had vanished.  \n\u201cAndy!\u201d I tried again, louder \u201cJen? Lydia? Argh fuck\u201d I screamed as I felt a sharp sudden crack in my big toe. In rotating I\u2019d stubbed it on a wooden beam. It was a shock of agony, but on the plus side I\u2019d at least found a bench again. In pain, exhaustion and dismay I collapsed to sitting and lent over to try to catch my breath. This wasn\u2019t happening. This was a heat induced delusion. You can\u2019t get lost in a sauna. This is the fantasy of a man who has lost too much bodily fluid. I looked up. Some of the steam had began to dissipate and now the room was visible again. Only it wasn\u2019t the same room. It was still a sauna, of sorts, but now it was significantly larger than the one I\u2019d entered. The floor spanned nearly twenty metres by twenty metres. If it was just the scale that had changed I could have put this down to my continued heat delirium\u2026but it was everything.The floor tiles that had previously been a glossy porcelain were now obsidian black, the grouting a deep red. The wood was no longer varnished oak but something much older\u2026much much older\u2026\u2019ship like\u2019 was the only word that came to mind.But the thing that made my stomach\u2026The thing that made me want to scream for this crazy fever to end was the levels. The seats\u2026which had previously been three tiers tall, now went up and up and up, ascending like steps for a species much larger than a human. Steps for a\u2026I counted at least 10 levels rising up before they were enveloped by the gloom of the room. Something in my stomach told me they went on though. On and on and on. But to what?  \nI also noticed that on the left and right of the room, at tiered intervals, there were exits. Dark wooden tunnels set into the steps that lead off in long corridors away from the sauna. Their darkness an invitation to explore.   \nI blinked myself back into my body, fighting the urge to go any deeper into this odd chamber in which I\u2019d found myself.It was then that I spotted them again. The rest of the Sauna Club. Perhaps the steam had just cleared enough let me see them but I was sure they hadn\u2019t been there a moment ago.  \n\u201cWhere\u2026where were you!\u201d I tried to yell but a wheeze was the best I could manage.  \n\u201cWe all had to pass through the steam. Some times it\u2019s quick\u2026I told you Mike\u2026we\u2019re all feeling our way through this. I don\u2019t know much more than you do.\u201d Andy stood, 7 tiers up, stark naked and staring down at me, as unabashed by his nudity as only a 60 yr old male can be.   \nJen was to his right, down a few levels and stood beside one of the exit tunnels. She was also slowly disrobing. As she peeled away her swimming costume I noticed that both her breasts were missing, the scaring beneath a tell-tale sign of a recent mastectomy.   \nOn the opposite side of the room was Lydia. Only one step up from me and with a single ping, the top piece of her bikini sprung off. I was so busy trying not to stare at her perfect breasts that it was only then that I noticed the scaring on her arms and inner thighs. Sak was the only one who didn\u2019t want to hang about for any of my shit. All I saw of him was a taught ass disappearing down one of the tunnels before he was gone.  \n\u201cWhy are you all taking your clothes off?\u201d I gasped.  \n\u201cIt helps.\u201d Andy shrugged. \u201cI told you Mike. You\u2019ve got to see it to believe it. Remember, just breath.\u201d  \n\u201cWhere the fuck have you brought me?\u201d  \n\u201cDon\u2019t get mad\u2026You can leave any time. Just spit on the coals and this\u2019ll all be over. You\u2019ll be\u2026back. BUT if you want to stay\u2026and I\u2019d highly recommend staying\u2026then this world is ours to explore. I can\u2019t tell you were to go. That\u2019s not how this works. Just remember, don\u2019t outstay the timer.\u201d   \nI clocked the timer on the wall. Different again. Longer, the grains of sand more ashen.   \n\u201cWherever you go, remember your way back and if you get too hot, leave! This isn\u2019t a dream Mike. Whatever happens here, happens. I learnt that the hard way.\u201d   \nI had so many questions but Andy was already turning to leave.  \n\u201cOh\u201d Andy paused \u201cand never, NEVER go out there\u201d He pointed to the wall behind me. I looked around to see a glass door leading out to the poolside. This I was certain hadn\u2019t been there before. Through the darkened glass I could see the pool beyond but again\u2026changed. The dark black tiles continued to the pools edge where the water looked stagnant.\u201cNo matter what you see, you can\u2019t help them. That\u2019s not our world.\u201d   \nI looked back to see Andy climbing, step after step, up and away into the blackness. A man with a mission. I looked to Jen for some semblance of reason   \n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Where\u2019s he going?\u201d  \n\u201cAndy always goes up\u201d Jen smiled like that was the most perfectly reasonable thing in the world.  \n\u201cWhy? What\u2019s up there?\u201d  \n\u201cWe\u2019re all here looking for something.\u201d  \n\u201cWhat?\u201d  \n\u201cIt\u2019s personal. You need to go and find yours?\u201d  \n\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u201d Jen smiled patiently \u201cyou\u2019ll find it or you won\u2019t. Just be careful who you trust.\u201d And then she was gone. Off down a tunnel.  \nLydia took a step towards me and I noticed that she was gently crying. Crying whilst still trying to preserve that odd fake smile of hers. \u201cTake it slowly. You\u2019ll get the hang of it.\u201d I turned my head away, back to the world beyond. For some reason the poolside filled me with a terror I couldn\u2019t express. It was all the same and yet\u2026broken.  \nThere were still swimmers in the water but\u2026but when was the last time they had taken a stroke? Or come up to breath? For that matter they weren\u2019t swimmers at all. They were just\u2026bodies, floating idly in the lanes. All around the pool sat lifeguards in their high metal watching chairs\u20269 of them\u2026dark watchers in thick waders and anoraks\u2026and they were old. Impossibly old\u2026Keeping a careful eye on the bodies as they drowned before them. Behind them I could see the glass windows leading to the outside world\u2026Or what should have been our world. Instead all I could see was barren land and scorched earth. Orange clouds in a blood red sky hurtling by as if they were in fast forward\u2026so fast it looked like the whole world was rushing through time and the only stationary thing was the sun, but that was\u2026  \n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go out their Mike. Really!\u201d Lydia's hand seized my wrist. Nothing cutesy this time. A vice like grip and she meant it. \u201cTell me you won\u2019t?\u201d  \n\u201cI won\u2019t\u201d  \n\u201cGood. I need to go\u2026I need to\u2026search. Will you pray with me a moment Mike? I might really find him this time.\u201d I watched her close her eyes and start to mutter words of prayer. Before her eyelids closed, for the first time I\u2019d noticed just how dilated Lydia\u2019s pupils were and wondered if that was an effect of the heat or whether she hadn\u2019t taken something before this little adventure began. Then her eyes flicked open and she backed away from me, retreating towards one of the tunnels. Her eyes and body an invitation to follow\u2026  \n\u201cIs it safe?\u201d I asked dumbly.   \nShe giggled \u201cEvery maze has its minotaurs\u201d and with a wink she was gone, leaving me standing there. Alone in the chamber. Not knowing whether to go up, left, right, back or\u2026My heart was slowing. Pounding.I wanted to\u2026I needed to\u2026I spat on the coals and in a blink I was back the sauna.   \nNot that ghastly eternal sauna or whatever the fuck it was, just a normal leisure centre sauna. A moderate temperate. Outside a normal pool side of normal people, doing normal lengths.  \nAnd I was alone. No Andy, no Jen, no Sak\u2026.just me.   \nThe only one not brave enough to explore further than the chamber.   \nI felt embarrassed then. I\u2019d bottled it\u2026like I always do.  \nThe feeling of shame was sudden but fleeting.   \nA second later it was replaced by intense nausea and I threw up all over the floor. Before there was anyone to notice or blame me I up and left. Left the sauna, left the gym and got home as quickly as my fat little feet could carry me.  \n\n\nIn the days that followed my broken toe ballooned...my only tangible take away from that strange place in the mists. On the second day, I was so sick of the swelling that I squeezed and squeezed and squeezed it until hot red pus began to ooze from the side of the nail and is it did I saw a dark wooden slither of wood slide out as well. An ancient looking splinter that belonged to...a world that shouldn't exist.  \n\n\nIt\u2019s taken me a few days to type this up\u2026a few days to find the right words. But in those day\u2019s I\u2019ve felt\u2026great. There\u2019s no way to say it other than - I have a fire in me. And honest to god I think I\u2019ve even shifted a pound or 2! Something in my body keeps telling me to go back\u2026to go back and sit with the sauna club again and\u2026to be a little braver this time\u2026to maybe explore a little further into that chamber that haunts my dreams and see what I missed out on in the Sauna game.  \n\n\nBecause\u2026I do want to change. I want my life to change. I want\u2026I want something that maybe I can only find in that baptism of steam?  \n\n\nTrue to form I spent a while dithering before deciding whether I\u2019d show my face at the sauna club again. Until I had the dream.It was one of those \u2018didn\u2019t even realise I was dreaming until I woke up dreams\u2019.  \nI was back at the pool, swimming lanes with the morning crowd. Not for nothing but I was good. I was no longer holding up old biddies but really tearing up and down the fast lane.  \nThen I remembered the sauna and between strokes began looking in through its glass doors. It drew me in and someone else was in there. A single figure stood in the centre of the room shrouded in white mists. In his hands he held some kind of old marble basin. The figure was deep in ritual, bowing their head over the bowl and drawing a deep breath, so deep that they drew tendrils of steam from the basin to their nostrils. The wisps seemed to seek out a way into the man\u2019s body. With each long drag from the bowl his body seemed to change.  \nI\u2019d take a stroke and when I looked again his biceps were larger.  \nAnother stroke and his thighs had bulged.  \nAnother stroke and his neck flared.  \nStroke.  \nAbs.  \nStroke.  \nJawline.  \nStroke.  \nPectorals.  \nI finished my length and on the about turn saw that the man still wasn\u2019t done but now the changes were taking their toll. Unpleasant white veins began to work across his body. Each deep inhale caused the man to grit his teeth in agony. The white of his eyes turning red.I knew this man. It was Sak. Another breath and his muscles were beyond \u2018well defined\u2019. The bulges looked stretched to burst while the crevices looked like trenches, like Sak was both tearing apart and collapsing in on himself. Another breath and I watched his skin change between strokes. First tan, then sun kissed then burnt and then charred. His tribe work tattooed seemed to glow a fiery red.  \nSak screamed but he couldn\u2019t help himself. A final deep breath. Deeper than the others. The steam filling his lungs to bursting. I watched as his clenched teeth broke in his mouth as his eyes began to melt from their sockets. Saks skin flaked away from his perfect muscles. Steam poured from his eye sockets.The basin fell from his hands and just before it shattered on the floor of the sauna I finished my lap and woke up.  \nIt was 7am and I knew today would be the day I returned to sauna club. I'll update you later today on how I get on.",

    "postText": "That is what I tell myself every day. Staring out the window, watching the cotton candy clouds drift past me bathed in orange, I can\u2019t help but feel jealous.\n\nThey are so *free.* Like a bird. Flying around the world, seeing the sights and sounds. And I am stuck here behind four walls. Chained by my ambition, my misfortune.\n\nAnd by *her.*\n\nHer name is Nara and we met by accident. A few years ago I was on a road trip through half of the United States. I should\u2019ve taken a plane or something to meet my folks on the West Coast, but college was much more stressful than I thought and I wanted time to myself.\n\nOr perhaps I *should* have taken that plane. I wouldn\u2019t have met her then.\n\nIt was already very cloudy when I left, but by night on the first day the clouds had morphed from a happy white to a dull gray. They huddled together in clumps, glancing worriedly down at me like I knew something they didn\u2019t. Secrets left untold.\n\nOn the second day I heard thunder rumbling in the distance; and by the afternoon it had turned into a full-blown storm. The wind howled and thrashed against my car; the rain slammed hard against the windshield. I gritted my teeth, gripping the wheel so hard my knuckles turned white.\n\nMy car screamed and leaned dangerously to the left, so I jerked the wheel to the right so that it righted itself. I peered hard through the dense curtain of fog, trying to find some sign of life. A motel perhaps. Or a farmhouse. Or even a caravan containing a kind soul willing to shelter someone from the pouring rain.\n\nBut even then I knew it was futile. The last time I saw anything remotely close to human civilisation was a sign that read \u2018*Welcome to Kansas\u2019* about 100 miles back.\n\nThunder roared and lightning cracked the sky in half like a whip. The trees were shaking; they were thin shadows in the darkened sky, their branches waving wildly like witches dancing around a cauldron.\n\nWhat happened next was something I never forgot. The way lightning arched forward and sliced the tree into two. The way the tree swayed and groaned like an old man.\n\nThe shadow upon my car.\n\nMy foot scraping the accelerator pedal. Jamming it down, not quick enough.\n\nThe roof of my car caving in like a crushed can of Pepsi.\n\nThen silence.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nMy first thought was that I had died and gone to heaven.\n\nI was lying on what seemed to be soft, fluffy clouds. Warm light shone down on my face, making me blush. In the distance I heard crackling fire.\n\nI was also naked.\n\nI tried to sit up to take my bearings, but then I immediately collapsed back onto my pillow.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re weak. Rest.\u201d\n\nThe voice sounded like it came from somewhere far away. It was rich and smooth, like liquid chocolate, and I felt it vibrate through my spine. Taking away my worries, my fear and my pain, and everything in between.\n\nStrong hands lifted me up and gave me a cup. I took a weak sip, feeling warm chicken miso soup run down my throat. It was delicious.\n\n\u201cAre you feeling better? You looked terrible last night.\u201d\n\nMy vision finally cleared and the stars finally went away to find my saviour bending down over me. She is beautiful, I thought drowsily. Like an angel sent down from heaven.\n\nShe had a small face, a small and skinny build and an even smaller nose. But her eyes were as big as a sky full of stars and her long black hair swept over her face. I was mesmerised.\n\n\u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d the girl repeated. The fact she was talking to me registered somewhere in my foggy mind.\n\n\u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d she continued, arranging the pillows and blankets to form a little nest. Then the girl climbed up next to me and stroked my hand. That fuzzy little tingle shot up my spine again and I loved it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name? I\u2019m Nara. I haven\u2019t seen you around these parts before. In fact I haven\u2019t seen anyone for years. Where are you from?\u201d\n\nI answered her questions as calmly as I could, although it was impossible with her interrupting me every 5 minutes. Her enthusiasm bubbled up like a fiery volcano as she chatted away about herself. A smile crept up my face. She reminded me of my little sister.\n\nOver the next few days Nara came in to give me more chicken miso soup and keep me company. I could still hear the storm going on outside; the wind still howling and tearing away at the windows like a toddler throwing a tantrum; the rain hanging low like dense fog and rolling through the cornfields.\n\nI had never felt so thankful that I was safe and warm inside this house.\n\nI soon looked forward to Nara\u2019s visits every day. To be perfectly honest there was nothing much to do. I tried continuing my studies, but the words blurred on the screen and made my eyes hurt.\n\nSo instead I slept, but even then I grew bored of just staring at the ceiling.\n\nNara had a way of lighting up your life, like a little lamp in the dark. She came around 7pm, no more than 5 minutes late, and we spent the whole evening talking until one of us (usually me) fell asleep.\n\nThrough these conversations we realised we had a lot in common. Same love for the sciences; same immigration woes. Same countries we went to on holiday. Little things like that.\n\n\u201cDo you think this storm will ever stop?\u201d\n\nNara blinked at me, surprised by my question. We had been talking about the tea plantations in Jeju. *(Kenji loved it, Nara recalled. Rolled around in the mud like the brotherly pig he was.)*\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she answered after a while. \u201cIt has been raining here for ages.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill I be able to go home then?\u201d\n\nIt was the million-dollar question. Nara went silent, and thought for a while. The power briefly went out; the lightning striking her face in a deathly glow.\n\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\nNara\u2019s lips curled up in a small smile, and an equally small shiver crept up my spine.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen I was strong enough to walk, Nara stopped coming so often, saying she had to study. Therefore I started exploring her house on my own. My footsteps echoed through long, winding hallways and my shadow danced on peeling walls and locked wooden doors. All I could think of was that Nara hit the jackpot when she found this house by chance. It was ten times bigger than my own family house.\n\nThe door was open at the furthest end of the hall. It was noon at the time; the house was as quiet as the dead. With nothing else to do I went in.\n\nI appeared to be in some sort of library. Books lined the shelves and stretched up to the sky. The ceiling was painted with baby angels playing flutes and trumpets. It was in the old Renaissance style, I marveled, like the artist had painted it so lovingly and then preserved it forever for all to see.\n\nI impulsively pulled one of the books out and glanced at the cover.\n\n*Beauty and the Soul* by Pearl F. Ekson.\n\nPassages of philosophy were found inside the book, along with anecdotes and stories on what it meant to be pretty. I set it aside and pulled out another one. This one was full of medical drawings; the human body split up into many different sections and described in detail. They grinned at me from within the pages, as if delighted by red ink trailing across the page.\n\nMy gut twisted. I felt sick.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of my old textbooks.\u201d\n\nNara had appeared behind me, so silent I thought she was a ghost. She gently took the book from me and returned it to the shelf.\n\n\u201cI was in med school. One month away from graduation.\u201d\n\nHer face was burning up. She was choking on her words.\n\n\u201cGood school. My parents were so, so proud. And I was happy. So happy\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd\u2014and then, the war. P-Pearl Harbour\u2026\u201d\n\nNara turned away from me, her face hot with tears. I didn\u2019t speak; I could only listen to her sob, not bold enough to intrude with another probing question that would only make it worse.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a plastic surgeon for so long. It has to be that.\u201d She shrunk away from me, her voice, her frame, all of her. \u201cI\u2019ve never had dreams before that. Not really.\u201d\n\n\u201cNara\u2014\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know what else to say. Nara ran out of the room, her sobs echoing down the hallway. I watched her leave, then wordlessly returned the philosophy book to the shelf.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nIt sounded hollow. The tsunami had long swept the coast, leaving behind debris I had to pick up. I sat there for a moment, watching the rain dribble on the window, my heart shattering along with hers.\n\nFinally I resolved to stop moping around and to make it up to her properly.\n\nIt took me really long to track her down, but eventually I heard loud sobs behind a locked door.\n\n\u201cGo away, Penny.\u201d\n\nHer words slapped me in the face and it burned. I counted slowly to ten and breathed deep.\n\n\u201cNara. I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have touched your things. And\u2026\u201d\n\nI racked my brains, trying to think of a suitable compensation. The sobs stopped. Nara waited. The tension was as thick as the door between us.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you with your work,\u201d I blurted out. \u201cAnd show you all the new stuff since you left school. Like the ones on PubMed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeal?\u201d\n\nThe door creaked open. Nara stood there like a little lost ghost. Her face was pale. Empty.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s PubMed?\u201d\n\nI ended up spending the afternoon teaching Nara about the wonders of the Internet. It was lovely to see her eyes light up like I gave her the best Christmas present in the whole wide world, the way she chatted animatedly and flapped her hands at every new article, new set of data or statistics, new *everything* that showed up on the tiny laptop screen. I smiled, my heart melting at her growing excitement and laughter, the sins of the morning forgotten between us. It was still raining outside, but the dim ceiling lamp shone warmly down on us like morning sunshine.\n\nWe spent so long online that time flew like a dream, and it was only when Nara gave a huge yawn and rested her head on my lap that I decided to take my leave. I bade her good night and walked back to my room, where I changed into pyjamas, brushed my teeth and got into bed.\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t sleep.\n\nThe diagrams from Nara\u2019s medical books walked out of the pages and into my mind, dragging their entrails behind them like sticky chains. I woke up many times screaming.\n\nThen I paused, and listened, and realised not all the screams were mine.\n\n*Outside.*\n\nI crept through the house, my heart beating in my throat. The screams crashed throughout the house like ripples in a pond, so loud that occasionally I had to close my eyes to rest. I wondered why Nara hadn\u2019t woken up from the screams yet. She must sleep like a log.\n\nThey were even louder downstairs. Like somebody had hidden speakers all over the room and amped it up to a thousand. I sank to my feet, my hands over my ears, sobbing as loud as the rain.\n\nThen silence.\n\nThe screams were gone as quickly as they appeared. I blinked, rubbing tears from my eyes. Everything hurt.\n\nI couldn\u2019t get up. I lay on my back, trying to catch my breath, and listened to my heart rate going a thousand miles per hour. Although they were gone, my mind raced with questions. Who was screaming?\n\n*And why?*\n\nThe rain responded by slamming its fists against the glass-domed windows.\n\nI must\u2019ve fallen asleep, because the next thing I knew Nara was shaking me awake. The morning had come; faint daylight squeezed in through thick thunderclouds.\n\nHer worried black eyes met my own.\n\n\u201cAre you okay? You were out like a light.\u201d\n\nI blinked at her, my brain still a dense fog. Then everything crashed down on me.\n\nThe screams.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said shakily. The screams were still rattling around my head.\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d\n\nWords failed me. I coughed, feeling like I had a frog stuck in my throat. It felt too complicated to explain, the nightmares, the screams, the sinking feeling coiling and twisting around in my gut that this house was not as it seemed.\n\n**GET OUT! GET AWAY!**\n\n**NOW!**\n\nMy skin prickled with goosebumps.\n\nNara stiffened. Her eyes darted to somewhere behind me, as if expecting someone to jump out any moment.\n\n\u201cW-was this why you ran out last night?\u201d\n\nShe was shaking like a leaf, her face beading with cold sweat. I felt the urge to hug her, to hold her close to prevent her from shattering into a million tiny pieces, and tell her it was going to be okay.\n\nBut I was as paralysed as she was, the last of my nerves already crumbling into ashes.\n\n\u201cThey want me gone, Penny.\u201d\n\nHer voice was so soft I could barely hear her.\n\n\u201cEver since I came here. They hate me. A-and\u2026\u201d\n\nHer words evaporated ominously into the gloom. I nodded and managed to stand up. My knees knocked together and threatened to drag me back down.\n\n\u201cCome on, Nara.\u201d\n\nIt sounded small. Nara nodded mutely and I helped her on her feet. We hobbled together up the stairs, nearly tripping over each other. Yet no one dared to go alone. Danger was still lurking in the shadows, waiting patiently for those caught unaware.\n\nI settled her in my room, in the same bed she tucked me in when she found me all those weeks ago. In a way we were alone in this house together. Just as she rescued me, I now had to protect her.\n\nI sat with her for a while, watching her chest rise and fall like the receding waves on the Californian beach. As soon as she fell asleep, I set out on my own through the house.\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what I was looking for. But I knew I wanted answers. Something to help us.\n\nIt was quite some time before I reached the atrium where Nara found me this morning. I smiled to myself, knowing my search was easier now that I was used to this house.\n\nScreams ripped through the house, and the curtains flapped into my face. The house shook and shivered, moving to a rhythm it could only hear.\n\n**GET OUT! GET AWAY!**\n\nThe door creaked open.\n\nMy blood froze.\n\nI stood there for a while, trying to make myself as small as possible and prayed the door would close on its own, so I could run upstairs to safety with Nara, but then I felt a push.\n\nSomeone was dragging me towards the door.\n\nI screamed and lashed out, tried to resist as hard as I could, but it was like trying to fight against a strong ocean current. The door swayed back and forth, beckoning me towards the storm.\n\nThe moment I was out on the front step, the door slammed shut. I heard the click of a lock.\n\nI sighed and slid down the door, hoping Nara heard my screams and started looking for me. The rain trickled down the rooftop and plonked down on my head. The cold seeped in through my skin and bit my nerves raw, and I shivered and tried not to sneeze.\n\nI heard a car engine cough into life.\n\nI sat up, my eyes wide.\n\n*Isn\u2019t that MY car?*\n\nThe sounds of the car grew louder and louder, until it crashed into my ears like thunder. The lights came first, swinging back and forth like twin swords ready to battle, searching my face like I had something to hide. Then the bushes parted and it yelled a war-cry, and then the whole car came into view and shot towards my chest, its roof flapping madly and threatening to come off.\n\nI couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off my car. I pounded on the front door with all my strength.\n\n\u201cNARA!\u201d\n\nIt was getting closer. The car growled; its angry yellow eyes shone directly into my face. My life was flashing before me in the mirror. There I was as a baby, laughing on the plane to America; there I was in Jeju, in Osaka, in Saigon, where my grandfather grew up; there I was when I first received\u2026\n\nThe door was yanked open. Nara screamed.\n\nI scrambled inside as quickly as I could.\n\nNara slammed the door shut\u2014just in time. I heard the sound of metal crashing against wood, something bouncing off into the bushes, and finally\u2014to my relief\u2014the sound of the car engine dying.\n\nNara turned towards me, her face red as a fire engine.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell were you *doing* outside?\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t speak. Nara didn\u2019t have to tell me twice; I knew it was all my fault. My fault for making her worry. My fault for endangering my safety\u2014and possibly hers too.\n\nInstead I let my eyes wander outside to the still pouring rain. I was still hot. From nearly getting killed by my own car, perhaps, or maybe from Nara\u2019s perpetual glare boring down against the side of my head.\n\nNara softened.\n\n\u201cLook, Penny,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cIt-it\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d\n\nIt was her turn to stare outside. Her voice trembled; hot tears cascaded down her face as she slipped once again into her worst memories. I saw what was coming and it made me feel even worse.\n\n\u201cYou remind me of my brother. So, so much.\u201d\n\nHer words punched me in the gut.\n\n\u201cAnd I can\u2019t lose you. Not again. Not like him. So please don\u2019t do anything like this again. Promise?\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise,\u201d I whispered back.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nNara watched me like a hawk over the next few days. She stuck by me like glue, and constantly peppered me with questions. Like she wanted to forget everything between us.\n\nI let Nara borrow my laptop to read more journal articles and helped her with her research when she needed it; and took care of her when her face was buried into the keyboard. It was a good way to keep my thoughts away from the horrors at night, when the house shook with the moans and screams that rippled through the walls.\n\nSeveral nights after I was nearly killed by my own car, I lay in bed next to Nara with cotton stuffed into my ears. Nara\u2014sweet summer child\u2014was out the moment her head hit the pillow, but I couldn\u2019t sleep. Instead I stared at the walls, focusing on Nara\u2019s snores that were warm and deep like a flickering campfire.\n\nThe screams started, burrowing deep into my brain. I gritted my teeth and wished morning would come faster.\n\n**GET OUT! GET AWAY!**\n\nIt had risen to a crescendo, louder than my thoughts, louder than the thunder outside. I glanced worriedly over at Nara, but that girl could sleep like a rock.\n\nFinally the house could take it no longer, and the walls started to burst, like an overflowing pipe.\n\nNo, not burst.\n\n*Ripple.*\n\nThe walls were squeezing and twisting and bending outwards, shaping and cracking into\u2026into\u2026\n\n*Lips.*\n\nThen came the eyes, squishing and fighting its way to the surface, so meticulously carved it could\u2019ve come from one of Nara\u2019s textbooks.\n\n**GET OUT! GET AWAY!**\n\nThey were everywhere now. A sea of lips and eyes, side by side like they were part of the wallpaper. The eyes flickered, zoomed in on the sleeping girl next to me.\n\n*Nara!*\n\nHer name came out in a strangled whisper. I wanted to reach out to her, pull her tighter, reassure myself everything was all right\u2013but my hand passed right through her body like she was made out of water.\n\nThen Nara began to *rise.*\n\nHigher and higher, until she was at least three feet above the bed. The lips curved into a victorious smile; the voices hissed like a snake. She was glowing too, an eerie blue, like a UFO in those old science fiction shows, lighting up the room in the creepiest way possible.\n\nI could only watch, transfixed.\n\nNara reached the ceiling, and for a few brief seconds it was as if time had stopped. My breath caught in my throat. I could no longer scream.\n\nThen she hurtled towards the opposite wall at the speed of light, crashed into the wall and crumpled to a mess on the floor.\n\n\u201cNARA!\u201d\n\nIt came out shrill. I scrambled out of bed and ran over to check on her. She seemed fine for some reason\u2013no bruises, no cuts or scrapes. Nara moaned in her pain and cracked one eye open.\n\nThen she screamed, and my heart once again stopped.\n\nGreen blood was pouring out of those mouths, engulfing everything in sight\u2013the shelves, the bed\u2013everything. I watched as the wood slowly crumbled away until it was nothing but ashes.\n\nMy own legs were starting to burn. There wasn\u2019t much time left.\n\nWith the last of my strength I dragged Nara outside and slammed the door shut, praying it would hold. My heart was beating so fast I thought it would leap out my throat. I checked the time on my watch. It was thirty-four minutes past midnight.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked her shakily.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Nara mumbled. She rubbed her head. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\nI wasted no time filling her in. Nara said nothing, just stared at the bedroom door with misty eyes.  We sat there for a while, listening to the pouring rain and the howls of whatever was in there. Nara yawned.\n\n\u201cNara,\u201d I said suddenly. \u201cI think we need to call an exorcist. Maybe then you could live in peace.\u201d\n\nNara frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s an exorcist?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone who chases demons away\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a superhero?\u201d\n\n**GET OUT! GET AWAY!**\n\nThe voices were getting more intense, spilling out of the door and crackling against the walls like static. An image flashed into my mind of the faces behind the door shaking their heads in disapproval. I swallowed and tried to focus on the matter at hand.\n\n\u201cKind of.\u201d\n\nNara brightened, her eyes twinkling like a pair of lightbulbs. \u201cI know how!\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah! An old friend taught me! Come on!\u201d\n\nNara raced down the hallway and I tried to follow her, but it was like trying to walk in concrete boots. Something was pulling me back, sticking me tight to the floor. Hands snaked out of cracks in the walls and held me tight.\n\nI struggled as hard as I could, tried to wriggle out of their grip, but they only squeezed me tighter.\n\nMy heart was beating faster than ever, a rhythmic *thud thud thud* that pounded in my ears like a drum.\n\nEverything was spinning, pulsing into red and black. Red and black.\n\nStars burst in front of my eyes, then it faded to black. My mind raced, desperately trying to find a way out. Time was not on my side.\n\nSo I leaned down and did the only thing I could think of: I bit.\n\nIt tasted disgusting. Like hand sanitizer and  bloody chalk. The voices screamed in their pain and despair; the hands let go and fled back to the walls as if wounded. The house was shaking like an earthquake.\n\nI collapsed onto the floor, breathing heavily.\n\n\u201cPenny?\u201d\n\nNara had come back. She frowned.\n\n\u201cWhat happened? Are you okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d My legs felt like they were made of jelly. The sooner we could get rid of the ghosts, the sooner we could live in peace. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nWe returned to the study. Everything else was cleared away. There was a circle drawn on the floor in red chalk. Around it were several strange symbols: something that looked like an ox, a ram, and a human leg. The windows were closed, the curtains drawn, leaving behind a thin border of light.\n\nNara rummaged through the shelves and pulled out a large book bound with black fur. Something alive at least, and still breathing. It bristled at her touch and hissed like a cat with its hackles raised.\n\n\u201cStand in the circle,\u201d she instructed. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to make sure the spell would work.\u201d\n\nShe flipped through the old yellowed pages delicately, like they were fine silk. I heard her murmur to herself as she squinted at the tiny cursive text. Each page was signed with a heart with T.C in the centre.\n\nI didn\u2019t know why, but shivers were crawling up my spine.\n\n\u201cAre you sure you know what you are doing, Nara?\u201d\n\nNara didn\u2019t reply. Instead she began *chanting*. Softly at first, and then louder, an eerie song that sounded like she was speaking many languages at once. It was strangely beautiful.\n\nGoosebumps bubbled up my skin. They grew bigger and bigger until they exploded with pus. I was feeling really hot, like I was being boiled alive inside my clothes. I resisted the urge to take them off.\n\n*Nara!*\n\nI couldn\u2019t speak. I couldn\u2019t scream. It sounded wrong\u2014too high, too shrill, nothing like myself. My voice was cracking. My bones were cracking. I watched in horror as skin and fat fell off in rough flakes.\n\nMy legs suddenly buckled under my weight, and I found myself on the floor, writhing on the ground like I was wrestling a snake. Fingers popped off like frozen fish sticks, followed by my toes and my eyeballs, and I felt new ones grow in their place.\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut, gritting my teeth against the pain coursing through my body like red-hot fire. Through my closed eyelids I could see the faces again, except they were exchanging knowing glances, like they were silently telling me we told you so.\n\nNara stepped into the circle and it felt strangely welcoming, like greeting a long-lost friend. She gave me a small hug, whispered something in my ear I could not understand, and all at once the pain dissipated.\n\nAnd finally I dared open my eyes. I looked down and I screamed.\n\nI wasn\u2019t Penny any more.\n\nStaring back at me in a smoothly-polished mirror instead of a red chalk-circle, surrounded by pearly-gray ash still falling around me like radioactive snowfall, was an exact copy of Nara. I could be her long-lost twin. Or even her clone.\n\nThe rain stopped. The sun began to shine.\n\nThe real Nara was nowhere to be found.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Immortality.*\n\nThe word rang clear in my mind as I scoured Nara\u2019s notes and books for answers. It was highlighted every time it came up in bright sunshine yellow.\n\nIt was her secret. Her life\u2019s work. A way that combined the science of plastic surgery with the dark magic of the occult. Jumping from body to body, into exact copies of herself. Perfect clones she crafted out of others she had met. Sometimes she failed. But most of the time she managed to do it.\n\nI shudder to think what happened to those who\u2026didn\u2019t make it.\n\nHer house is my prison, and her body my chains. I can\u2019t leave. She won\u2019t let me. Neither would she let me undo her mess. There\u2019s a dead end at every turn; each solution twists myself tighter into knots.\n\nAnd every night I fall asleep with memories that are not my own: a smiling boy that looks like a younger version of me (her?), strange smells of bleach and chlorine, attempts to climb a wall with barbed wire twenty feet high. Deals to gods I shouldn\u2019t have made.\n\nEverything else\u2014the remnants of my old life, my past, my ambitions\u2026is wrapped in the distant fronds of my memory, drifting so far away it almost feels like a dream.  And most of the details are so fuzzy I\u2019m surprised I can write them down at all.\n\nEven my own name these days is slipping through the nets of my memory. Is Penny  my real name? I can\u2019t tell anymore. Nara is all I know.\n\nBut throughout it all I do know one thing. It is risky. Dangerous even. I don\u2019t want to hurt anybody, but it feels like I don\u2019t have a choice.\n\nSo um, can one of you lovely folks on Reddit stop by our house in Kansas for a bit?\n\n[I\u2014sorry, she\u2014desperately need you.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimbaKingdom/comments/vpixk6/boo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n[(SK)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimbaKingdom/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

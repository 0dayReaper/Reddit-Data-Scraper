    "postText": "So it all started with a box of bees. It was deep within the stores of the Company, in the depths where only the bravest dare enter. Well, that, and literally about everyone with a basic Level One access code.\n\nAnd in the depths one could find a box of bees, all dead and devoid of any color. Bees that had once nested in the suburbs of North Carolina, in an odd house that had always stood there.\n\nThey called it the House of Tongues.\n\nMy name is Canopy Hydrangea. I recover cursed artifacts, explore haunted places, and report back the information needed to the people I work for. The Company then arranged what has to be done to remove these blemishes from the world.\n\nIf it isn\u2019t possible, we make sure the evil of cursed artifacts and bizarre places doesn\u2019t make its way to the general public. \n\nBut sometimes, it\u2019s important to leak a report or two to the unsuspecting public. Makes for a good warning- and this particular file is one of many that must be known.\n\n\u201cSo, team,\u201d I began, as we sat around an old fireplace, in the bakery-turned cover for our base of operations, \u201cwhat has the Company found us today?\u201d\n\nRainie, my key assistant, tuned up the old projector and pressed a few buttons. Kyran faked a yawn, and my scrollkeeper, Cypress, laughed.\n\nWe all stopped laughing when the image of a dead dog, bloodied and covered in long, piercing slashes emerged. \u201cSo let\u2019s talk about the House of Tongues,\u201d Rainie began, changing the slide to an image of a remodeled, but still old looking house. \u201cThis house was built back in the 1620s, and\u2026\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll cut Rainie\u2019s exposition by a lot here. Many unnecessary details, but details that kept us intrigued and interested.\n\nThe house, built in 1627, was built by a migrating priest and his family. Initially, it was supposed to be a small cabin, a little summer place for rest and meditation. This all changed when, according to local mythology, the priest was offered a deal by an odd man in white and black.\n\nHe called himself the Night Merchant, and the priest gave up his cabin, and within seven days and seven nights a grand, expansive house replaced it.\n\nThe licking began to take place nearly a year after that. Not much is known from the priest\u2019s records- as Rainie tells it, \u201chis words were deemed heresy and burned.\u201d\n\nBut we do know that the house, named Attager Place changed hands over the centuries, though most records were lost to time. The more important records come after the end of the Great War.\n\n1927. A family, the Bakers, moves into Attager Place, now remodeled to fit it with a little town that popped up from the economic boom.\n\n1928. William Baker\u2019s \u2018youngest\u2019 daughter reports a sensation at night, a strange rough feeling, as if she were being \u2018licked by a cat\u2019. Cats do not approach Attager Place- in fact, the house does not seem to welcome all but human life.\n\nCats who approach it go mad and disappear. The family dog Baker brings along is found on the street, eviscerated by long, piercing slashings the police could never explain.\n\nThree months later the sightings begin.\n\nWilliam Baker goes out one day to investigate mewling noises behind the house. The entire backyard is trashed: pots have gone flying, dirt has been dug- the entire garden has been uprooted.\n\nDarting around the corner are monsters. Small, slender things, an ashen white with bodies as thin as sticks; their bones show, the muscles pulse.\n\nBut strangest of all are their heads, large and muscular, adorned with small horns that dot it, and two eyes he states as \u2018deep blue like the sea\u2019. Terrified and confused, William goes back to the house to fetch a rifle.\n\nWhen he goes back, though, they\u2019ve vanished.\n\nThe noises continue for the rest of the year- but always gone before he can take a good, clear look. But something else, far more chilling and incredible has appeared- one of his two daughters have vanished.\n\nBoth Company and government records show that the Bakers only had one daughter. And yet, in the cold winter of 1928 William Baker finds himself mad, shocked as he begins to remember a daughter that never existed.\n\nAn older daughter, he remembers. But try as he might, he can\u2019t picture her face- nor find any certificates, legal evidence she had existed.\n\nBut in the halls of the house she does. There\u2019s a bedroom with things that aren\u2019t supposed to be there. A bed, posters, and books- all evidence a teenage girl had once lived there.\n\nBut on paper, she does not exist. And neither does she exist in the minds of anyone else. His wife and \u2018only\u2019 daughter do not acknowledge the extra room. His neighbors seem to avoid him.\n\n1929. At night, they come. They appear as shadows in the windows, peering in with small hands, large, blue eyes. And then they open a circular, razorlike mouth and a long tongue with teeth emerges, licking the window and gently cracking it.\n\nWilliam takes his rifle and journeys outside.\n\nThe creatures seem to taunt him, gracefully avoiding his gunshots, leading him deeper and deeper into the woods that were not there when he bought the place. When he realizes, all too late, that his fences have ceased to exist- it\u2019s too late.\n\nThe creatures are gone. And behind him, in the large house called Attager Place, there are screams.\n\nWhen William Baker finally finds the house again, everything is silent. His wife and child are gone. The creatures sit cross legged and wait, tongues eerily lolling out. He shoots them but the bullets always seem to miss.\n\nBy dusk, they are gone.\n\nLegally, William Baker's wife and two kids do not exist. He spent the rest of his life telling the same tale in a mental asylum. He also claimed the creatures followed him there, always peeking in through the bars and windows.\n\nHe is found near death one day, bizarre lacerations and slashings. A man comes by, wrapped in shadow and gives him a buzzing box.\n\nBees. And the creatures never appeared-\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d Kyran cut in, \u201cyou\u2019re saying that bees, of all things stopped these\u2026 tongue aliens?\u201d\n\nRainie nodded, almost in disbelief of the story herself. \u201cWhoever gave him those bees knew how to deal with them,\u201d she continued. \u201cHowever it works- it worked. William got out the asylum and lived the rest of his life as a-\u201d\n\n\u201cA beekeeper!\u201d Cypress guess. Rainie nodded. \u201cSo if this case is closed, why has the Company handed it over to us?\u201d\n\nRainie sighed in disappointment. \u201cAs I was saying,\u201d she remarked, teeth clenched, \u201cthe bees have failed.\u201d A slide displayed thousands of dead bees, around the house. \u201cIn 1937 two Company Agents bought the house and bombarded the place with beehives. Beehives that have remained ever since, cared for by a gardener.\u201d She paused and switched it over to another angle. \u201cLast week, the gardener vanished, only remembered by a single surviving Company agent. Any guesses as to what they want us to do?\u201d\n\nI nodded and gleefully raised my hand. \u201cThey want us to clean it up. The bees, and the uh,\u201d I tried to think of the name, \u201cTongue Aliens. Tonliens, if you will.\u201d That generated some laughter. \u201cCypress, Kyran, you two are my containment experts-\u201d\n\nCypress revealed a drawing on an iPad- \u201cAlready working on a spell.\u201d\n\nKyran shrugged. \u201cThe new Ironsalt Guns are ready.\u201d\n\nI looked at Rainie in anticipation, wondering if there was more. \u201cThat\u2019s about it- there\u2019s a similar story that happened in 1932, but same old, same old.\u201d She paused, thinking. \u201cWe should also watch for artifact hunters- sources suggest Lorreno\u2019s crew may be looking to seize one of the uh, aliens for themselves.\u201d\n\nI practically growled- Lorreno and his crew were a gang of villains that dabbled in selling cursed artifacts and cryptids to shady dealers. \u201cCryptid smuggling?\u201d\n\nRainie nodded. Cypress noted this as well. \u201cIf they show, boss, we\u2019ll take them out this time.\u201d\n\nBy the next hour we\u2019d prepared all we\u2019d needed. We stood by a large, symbol adorned mirror and waited. Cypress chanted some ancient, long forgotten poetry, and the mirror changed to a quiet street.\n\nRainie stepped through, then Cypress, Kyran, and me, and then we were face to face with Attager Place.\n\nI felt a sense of great discomfort. \u201cDo you-\u201d I muffled my ears, suddenly starting to hurt, \u201chead that?!\u201d\n\nIt was the sound of bees, buzzing all at once in a cursed, malevolent death knell. I screamed in pain and fell to the floor. Cypress caught me as I fell and read off of their phone. \u201cInfected beast of\u2026 unholy\u2026\u201d I drifted in and out as the ghost swarm dazed me, \u201cbegone!\u201d\n\nAnd it was over, and my vision cleared. \u201cThe house is\u2026 powerful,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re just dealing with the tongue things,\u201d I stammered, still dizzy. \u201cThere\u2019s,\u201d I reached into the ether, \u201cmore than one entity.\u201d\n\nKyran looked a bit worried. \u201cShould we call for backup?\u201d\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d I replied. \u201cWe can take it.\u201d\n\nWe entered the house, the buzzing still in the back of my mind. As told, a swarm of bees lay dead around the place, and with every step we took we a loud crunch emanated, echoing around the house.\n\nBesides that, and the deep fear we were all beginning to feel, there was nothing. \u201cAll the events happened at night,\u201d Rainie reminded. \u201cAnd it is-\u201d\n\ndrip-drop\n\nSomething red and thick fell onto my hand. It was blood. drip-drop. More began to fall from the ceiling, a river of blood pouring from cracks. It was cold and seemed to pulse in time, as if- alive.\n\nRainie wrote into a journal, then collected a sample. \u201cWeird. It\u2019s not a threat.\u201d\n\nKyran nervously pointed his weapon around. \u201cWell I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell go on and Ironsalt it,\u201d I told. \u201cI don\u2019t like it either.\u201d\n\nKyran nodded, reached into his bag and found a sphere of white. We averted our eyes as he lit the fuse, tossing it up into the air and exploding in light, spraying us with salt and fine iron- enchanted so that it would not hurt us.\n\nThe ghost-blood stopped and fell to the ground, evaporating into ash. \u201cOne phenomena neutralized,\u201d Rainie noted.\n\nWe continued onwards, until the house decided to shift itself, creaking, trying to spin its halls so that we would emerge back where we came from. We were at the kitchen- then it would creak, and the door we opened-\n\n\u201cBack up front,\u201d I murmured.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll handle it,\u201d Cypress offered, already beginning to chant. The place let out a sigh, and things were restored. \u201cIt won\u2019t hold, though.\u201d\n\nAnd then they finally appeared. Little deformed things.\n\nPale bodies, large heads, large, bulbous eyes. They appeared in the corner of my eye at first, though as we ventured deeper into the house they seemed to dart here and there.\n\nKyran attempted to shoot them, but they seemed ever-evading, always just out of reach. Rainie noted them and sketched the beings. And as we got deeper the sound of the dead bees began to crescendo.\n\nAnd other noises. The sound of screams, of pleas for help. The house seemed to go on forever, unfolding, each layer of the house seemingly older and more arcane from the last.\n\nIn front, it had seemed like a remodeled house. Inside, it was at least thirty years old, and in each subsequent hall, room it got older and older. In the distance we saw something dark and rocky.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a cave, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I asked.\n\nCypress\u2019 magic was of no use either. \u201cWait,\u201d they paused, as we reached the cave. The shadows flickered within, and the creatures seemed to whisper in the darkness. He spun around and gasped. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been tricked.\u201d\n\nI turned to see- a wall. A solid wall of paint and brick. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t there the last time I-\u201d I screamed as something lashed out, cutting me. \u201cAgh!\u201d A tongue drew into the darkness, sharp.\n\n\u201cLights!\u201d Rainie shouted, flicking on a lantern. The electric device sputtered, and failed- illuminating about a dozen tongue-things in the darkness, leaping out into shadow. \u201cDamn it!\u201d\n\nKyran began to fire aimlessly as more and more tongues darted in and out, slashing us. \u201cCypress, boss, solution?\u201d\n\nCypress read off their phone, and a ball of light emerged in front of us, yet the darkness still remained. The wall behind us began to move, pushing us forward.\n\nThe magician yelped and tendrils of paint burst from the wall ensnaring him. \u201cHelp me!\u201d I flicked a knife open and him loose.\n\nWe were being forced forwards. The wall behind us seemed ever fleshy now, tendrils of red dripping limbs reaching out at us. In front, tongues lashed out, cutting us up, one by one.\n\nBut we continued to push, running forwards and firing as the wall of flesh behind us forced us into the darkness.\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d I shouted. \u201cA building!\u201d\n\nThere was something there. Ancient, and carved from stone. The ruins of an ancient temple that seemed just like the house. Statues of the tongue things lay in wait, eerily inviting us in.\n\nThe wall picked up speed, and we ran into the ruin, just as the wall crashed into it\u2019s entrance, locking us within.\n\nA flash- then black goo. \u201cI got one!\u201d Kyran cheered, stepping over and picking it up. It whined, still alive, and a tongue lashed out- only for Kyran to sever it. \u201cThey can be killed.\u201d\n\nRainie was studying the walls of the temple- the death of the creature had scared them off- for now, at least. \u201cThis place is old. Like, really old- I\u2019ve never seen this,\u201d she gestured to the arcane symbols on the walls, \u201clanguage before.\u201d\n\nCypress knelt down next to two skeletons, little marks of teeth all over. \u201cMust be the Bakers.\u201d\n\nAround us were more skeletons, all marked by small incisions. Most were ancient but some were all too new. A fresh corpse even lay in a corner, just a few days old.\n\nI looked at it. I recognized the corpse as a black market artifact dealer. \u201cServes you right.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompany Agents-\u201d Rainie gasped. A team, just like us lay dead on the floor, recently deceased. \u201cI thought we were the first to come here in a long time?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis place,\u201d I remembered, \u201ceats people. Memories. HQ probably sent them and forgot they existed.\u201d\n\nA scuttling came from deeper within, and the sound of bees suddenly stopped. An unceasing quiet came next, and suddenly I preferred the bees to the quiet.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d Cypress announced, \u201cI can get us out of here.\u201d And then they reached into their backpack and brought out, of all things-\n\n\u201cIs that a cat?!\u201d Rainie puzzled. \u201cDid you actually-\u201d\n\n\u201cI supposed it would come in handy,\u201d Cypress confessed. \u201cPlus, it isn\u2019t mine, and I\u2019ve got to return it.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough, guys,\u201d I ordered. \u201cCypress, how does this work?\u201d\n\nA glint in their eye came now. \u201cWell,\u201d they began, \u201cwe know that the house hates animals, right?\u201d we nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s see why.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, Cypress released the cat, and it trotted softly down a hall, deep into the temple. We followed, up until the cat stopped before a chamber, stone gates warding us off. \n\nI opened the gates- and then we saw it. \n\nThis was some sort of congregation room, a grand hall filled with stone benches, ancient symbols of old religion, and- thousands of the creatures, all sleeping, save for a dozen or so chattering and climbing the walls. \n\n\u201cLook- there,\u201d Cypress pointed to light in the corner of the hall, where creatures popped in and out. \u201cDaylight.\u201d\n\n\u201cA way out,\u201d I murmured.\n\n\u201cJust have to get through all of this first,\u201d Kryan pointed out.\n\n\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Cypress started, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n\nCypress returned a moment later with the corpse of the tongue-creature, then inscribed several symbols into it with a knife. They lit up, and we walked into the haldl, Cypress leading us forwards. \n\nThe creatures began to wake, jumping beside us and sniffing the air. \u201cI\u2019ve disguised us as a mass of them,\u201d Cypress explained. \u201cLet\u2019s see how long this holds.\u201d\n\nThe creatures ignored us, returning to hibernation. I observed the hall as we journeyed closer and closer to daylight. Statues of goat-like things watched us, tall and ancient, yet oddly familiar.\n\nThe creatures tended to the place, lighting candles and even managing a small garden towards the back. They did not construct the place- but whoever did left them to tend for it, to keep it sacred, safe.\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Cypress murmured. \u201cThe spell\u2019s worn off.\u201d That\u2019s when the creatures began to shift, paying attention to us once again. Cypress gulped, found the cat and threw it. \u201cRun!\u201d\n\nAnd so we did, towards daylight. The creatures lashed out at us, the cat seemed to distract them, pawing its way through the little beasts. \u201cI need rope,\u201d Cypress commanded, just as the light shone above us. \n\nAn opening seemed so far away. \u201cHere!\u201d I tossed it, and Cypress reached out and, with ancient art, floated it up. \n\n\u201cClimb!\u201d I shouted, already beginning to do so. \u201cGo!\u201d\n\nAnd as we climbed the creatures did so too, leaping from the walls to seize us. Kyran fired and Cypress did strange art. I slashed them away, and they fell to an ever growing pile below us.\n\nThree were on the rope below us. \u201cTake this!\u201d Kyran slashed the rope, cutting them loose.\n\nI rose into the light first, pressing open a grate and helping Cypress up. Rainie came next, then Kyran. I threw the rope over, and shut the grate back down. Still, they stuck to the walls, still chasing us.\n\nI found an explosive, strapped it to the grate and ran. A boom came behind us, and no opening remained.\n\nWe were in the backyard. \u201cI think,\u201d I murmured, \u201cI\u2019m going to submit this place for immediate destruction.\u201d\n\nAnd that was that. The place had been surveyed, our job was done. We\u2019d done all we could and found what we needed. We couldn\u2019t stop them on our own. A request was made, and the last time I heard of the place, it had both been burned, collapsed, and creatures seized for further study.\n\nAnother day was done. Another bizarre placed kept under control. If you know a place marked by evil- let us handle it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[mass grave](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ymah5/i_work_for_a_company_that_studies_cursed_places/)",

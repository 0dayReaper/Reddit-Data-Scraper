    "postText": "On my tenth birthday, I picked a dog from the pound. The pound had several beautiful dogs \u2013 huskies and German shepherds, sleek bluenose pit bulls and even a redbone hound \u2013 but the dog that caught my eye was a bowlegged teacup Chihuahua with wiry fur and ears that seemed to sprout from his neck.\n\nHis fur was prickly and he smelled like soggy corn chips. He also ate flies, snatching them out of the air like a clumsy frog.\n\nSo I named him Renfield.\n\nBack then, we lived on five acres of golden forest. My favorite spot on the property was a hollow inside a wild hedge. It was the perfect hideout; you could only access the hollow by crawling along a hidden trench because the branches formed a thick, dangerous interlock on all sides.\n\nI took Renfield inside the hedge that night. I remember the way sunlight shafted through the leaves and flowers, turning the space into a burrow of soft brown shadows overlaid with coppery light. My little dog looked up at me, eyes shining like amber in the dim. \n\nI petted him until he fell asleep. Then I crawled out of the hollow and called his name, intending to confuse him.\n\nHe panicked immediately, yelping and clawing madly at the impenetrable branches.\n\nHis terror felt like a gut punch. I crawled back into the hedge. The way he looked at me is burned into my memory: wide-eyed and joyfully relieved, but terrified. \n\nThat look was all I could think of the day I put him to sleep.\n\nI didn\u2019t have a choice; I\u2019d have him for eighteen years, and had medicated severe heart issues for four of those. He was in constant pain, so it was time.\n\nBut he knew something was wrong. He was so scared, and I scared him even more by crying. Tears always terrified him. \n\nI tried to push away the memory of that first night in the hedge, of the way I\u2019d scared him. But I couldn\u2019t, and no wonder. Putting him to sleep, I\u2019d trapped him again.\n\nOnly this time, I had to leave him behind.\n\nHe was my last lifeline. I felt him slipping away as surely as a drowning man feels a wave carry away his life preserver.\n\nMy crybaby tendencies didn\u2019t start or end with my dog. Take my dad. He\u2019d been in a nursing home for years by that point. He developed Alzheimer\u2019s early. The descent was brutal and swift. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, he had pancreatic cancer \u2013 automatically terminal and unimaginably excruciating.\n\nI stopped visiting around that time. Not because I didn\u2019t want to see him, but because I couldn\u2019t do it to him. Just try to imagine \u2013 you\u2019re in horrific pain, you don\u2019t know who or where you are, and your only visitor is a gaunt stranger who bursts into tears whenever they see you.\n\nI scared him to death whenever I visited. I made his disorienting, painful days that much worse. Stole what little peace he had.\n\nSo I stopped.\n\nI meant to sit with him at the end, when he\u2019d be in a drug-induced sleep so deep he wouldn\u2019t notice me holding his hands and sobbing. But I wasn\u2019t there when he died. I was at my doctor\u2019s office, digesting the news that I, too, was going to be sick for the rest of my life. \n\nI dreamed about my dad that night. He was trapped in the hedge and screaming for help. I tried to show him the way out for what felt like hours, but I was invisible. He couldn\u2019t see me or hear me. As far as he knew, he was alone. Somehow, in that irrepressible logic of dreams, I knew it was my fault.\n\nI woke up crying.\n\nIt was enough. I\u2019d had *enough*.\n\nI\u2019m not stupid or na\u00efve. Life is a tide. And the shitty truth is some of us live on a stormy coast.\n\nI knew this.\n\nBut I wanted a break. Just a couple of hours where I didn\u2019t feel sad.\n\nSo I went online, hoping to stumble on some kind of guided imagery technique or hypnotic ASMR. Something to create an artificially happy place, at least for a little while.\n\nI tried everything. Nothing worked. I kept searching anyway, trawling increasingly weird websites far into the night because the search itself was addicting. Not a happy place, but certainly a distracting one.\n\nSometime in the middle of the fifth night, I found an ancient Geocities page titled:\n\n*a recipe for happiness*\n\nI clicked, of course.\n\n*Are you tired of feeling bad? Want to cheer up? Well have I got good news for you. My friend gave me this RECIPE FOR HAPPINESS that works like a charm!*\n\n*There are TWO PARTS to the Recipe*\n\nWhat followed was a pretty standard honey cake recipe, although the last instructions gave me pause:\n\n*Mix the ingredients together in a glass bowl, then spit in the mixture*\n\n*Cook at whatever temperature you want for EXACTLY 20 minutes*\n\n*Cut in half. Put half outside your door. Eat the other half during\u2026*\n\n*PART TWO!!*\n\n*Take one HAPPY MEMORY and MEDITATE*\n\n*Think of someone who makes you happy*\n\n*Plan a perfect day*\n\n*Go to sleep thinking about your perfect day*\n\n*Do this and your sorrow will be eaten away!!!*\n\nIt made me smile. Eating cake while meditating on happier times wasn\u2019t bad advice. So I gave it a try. I even spit in the cake batter.\n\nI cut the cake and set half of it on the porch. Tendrils of steam twirled into the darkness, lit pale silver by the full moon. \n\nI curled up the couch to eat the remaining half. For my happy memory, I chose that first evening in the hollow: my little dog, lit to soft brilliance by the dying sun.\n\nAs for someone who made me happy, I picked my dad.\n\nThen I planned a perfect day. Or rather, remembered it.\n\nI\u2019d just started my first real job, and still lived with my parents. I\u2019d had a good day at work. My dog met me in the driveway, prancing and wiggling like he hadn\u2019t seen me for years. Dad cooked an early dinner and told jokes while my mom played her guitar. It rained that night. We went out to the porch, watching palm trees sway as torrents poured down. My dog was scared, so I picked him up and held him as thunder roared.\n\nAfterward, we ate brownies and ice cream. Then I settled in for the night and read a book until I fell asleep, with my dog cured at my feet.\n\nAs I drifted off, smiling at the memory, I swore I could feel him there: warm and surprisingly heavy, sprawling lazily over my toes. \n\nWhen I woke, that warm weight had shifted to my pillow.\n\nA terrible, painful hope coursed through me, one I couldn\u2019t even acknowledge.\n\nI opened my eyes.\n\nSomething tiny lay on my pillow in a drying pool of blood. Fuzzy and weirdly dirty, exuding drifting grey filaments that sparkled in the sun. Three milky eyes glinted over a horror show of a snout: cracked and bleeding, bursting with an improbable cluster of human molars. \n\nIt blinked \u2013 each eye just slightly out of tandem, opening and closing with a soft, wet *click* - and smiled. Ropes of bloody drool leaked between its teeth. It placed two cold paws on my face.\n\nThen it lowered its mouth over my own and inhaled.\n\nBreath and blood and every organ in my body seemed to travel up my esophagus. Like God Himself was sucking my guts through a straw.\n\nI whipped my head from side to side as the awful bottleneck sensation intensified.  All my guts were coming up, and so were emotions - no, *memories*: half-forgotten nightmares. Painful images of my withered father. The last time I saw my mother, dressed for work and setting a bowl of oatmeal on the counter while driving rain fell.  And my dog, my poor little dog, trying to run from the needle up until the very end.  \n\nI screamed into the mouth of the monster. I expected it to fly off, but it *inflated*: a furry flesh balloon growing, growing, growing \u2013\n\nWithout warning, it let go.\n\nI stumbled back, gagging. The monster \u2013 an engorged orb the size of a German Shepherd \u2013 simply smiled. Hazy morning light filtered through the window, bathing it in soft white.\n\nRage inexplicably built in my chest, growing exponentially every second.\n\n\u201cAre,\u201d it croaked, then burped.\n\nI wanted to kill it, to plunge my arms elbow-deep into its disgusting, distended body, and \u2013\n\n\u201cAre you sad?\u201d it asked.\n\nA storm of emotion \u2013 rage, disgust, contempt, even hilarity \u2013 roiled through me. Overwhelming, overpowering, and paralyzing.\n\n\u201cNo. You have no sadness.\u201d It poked its belly with a ridiculousy small hand. \u201cI have it.\u201d\n\nIt took a long, long time, but I finally realized that this absurd abomination hadn\u2019t eaten my guts.\n\nIt ate my feelings.\n\nNo sadness. No pain. No more stinging memories. Rage and confusion, sure. But underneath that was a satisfied calm akin to bliss.\n\nI left it alone in my bedroom and went for a drive.\n\nWhen I came back, I asked, \u201cWhat are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cA special treat,\u201d it answered.\n\nI decided I\u2019d had a psychotic break, and voluntarily checked myself into a hospital. After two days of assessments, they found nothing wrong. Why would they? I was on an even keel, basking in a curiously blank inner peace.\n\nWhen I got home, the monster was in my bed. Jolly, indecent roundness had withered to skeletal proportions. It looked awful. Starved. \n\n\u201cI need,\u201d it gasped. \u201cI need, or you will suffer again.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of returning to a life of despair, of *loss*, was crushing; I couldn\u2019t even fathom how I\u2019d survived it in the first, and felt I\u2019d never be able to do it again.\n\nSo I knelt by the bed and opened my mouth. The monster latched on and inhaled. The unpleasant bottleneck sensation returned: like my insides were crowding my windpipe. And with it, memories and feelings: the rage I\u2019d experienced upon meeting the monster; contempt at its ugliness; the fear of insanity. And more: my dog, old and grey, waddling happily after me. My father in his hospital bed, smiling uncertainly as he said my name for the last night. And more, and more \u2013\n\nI wrenched away, gasping. The monster smiled, fat and rotund again.\n\nOver the following days, we developed a routine. I went to work and attended doctor appointments, even visited friends. Then I came home and let the monster extract my negative feelings. Bad client at work? Removed and forgotten before the memory could sink in. Friend who wouldn\u2019t make eye contact? What did I care, my pet monster would take care of it like he took care of everything else.\n\nThat\u2019s what it did, you see: removed the feelings, the vibrancy, the *pain,* from painful things. Over the course of several weeks, it removed everything; I knew, dimly, that I experienced awful things on a daily basis, but I didn\u2019t *remember* them.\n\nThe monster removed triggers, too: before the year was up, the sight of my dog\u2019s bed no longer made me cry. Photos of my parents held almost no interest; I flipped through them on a regular basis, skimming places and faces that had so recently crushed me.\n\nAll the while, that peaceable bliss intensified. I flitted through life in a pleasant haze of calmness. My work life improved. My supervisor started talking about a promotion because I was so unflappable, so decisive. My friends were able to look at me again. And \u2013 for the first time in months \u2013 I was confident enough to reach out to them. \n\nOne day as I drove home from work, I realized I hadn\u2019t looked at my photos in a very long time. It\u2019s not that I cared, exactly. But it was a deviation. Those things no longer caused me pain, and I had nothing better to do.  So why not view them?\n\nI got home and obediently kneeled. The monster \u2013 now the size of a horse, twisted and bent like a mutated spider \u2013 fixed its mouth over mine. I\u2019d come to enjoy the process. It was uncomfortable and unpleasant, but familiar. And afterward, I always felt *happy*: peaceful, empty, and warm.\n\nWhen it finished, I opened my mother\u2019s photo album and began to browse.\n\nAfter a while, I realized I didn\u2019t recognize anybody. I remembered remembering them.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t remember them.\n\nThe stout man with curly hair like mine, the athletic woman who smiled like me, and the numerous people who wove in and out of this photographic narrative\u2026they all were strangers. \n\nI reached a picture of my ten-year-old self cuddling a ragged, homely Chihuahua. Ghosts of memories tickled my brain, urging me to remember, urging me to *know.* \n\nAnd I understood, finally, that I had lost something.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I cared. I felt so happy. Peaceful. My life was painless. I was great.\n\nBut I was also selfish. And I didn\u2019t like the idea that the monster had taken so much.  Where was the line between happiness and emptiness? I didn\u2019t want to be empty. I wanted to be full.\n\nSo, after many days of deliberation, I decided to make a change.\n\nI called off work, canceled much-needed doctor appointments, and settled in to search online.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d the monster asked.\n\n\u201cLooking up some special recipes,\u201d I said with a bland smile.\n\nIt took seven days, but I found the original recipe. At the bottom of the page was another entry:\n\n*a recipe for sadness*\n\nUnderneath were the words:\n\n*If you\u2019re really dumb, you can undo happiness =( You shouldn\u2019t, but it\u2019s up to you. So here.*\n\n*Mix cake batter folloing the INSTRUCTIONS above*\n\n*Cut your hand and drip your blood into the batter*\n\n*Cook the cake as instructed Above*\n\n*Cut the cake in half*\n\n*Give half to your Happiness, and eat the other half*\n\n*Now here\u2019s the sad part!!*\n\n*Remember the happy memory you meditated on*\n\n*Remember the person who made you happy*\n\n*Remember your perfect day*\n\n*Choose one to forget, OR\u2026*\n\n*Choose to never be happy again*\n\n*Or better yet, don\u2019t kill your happiness in the first place!*\n\nI agonized for days.\n\nMy monster \u2013 my happiness, my joy \u2013 continued to drain my pain, uncertainty, and fear. He quickly grew to three times his size.\n\nFinally, I made my decision.\n\nIt would be better to live in pain forever than to forget my father, my mother, or my dog.\n\nSo I followed the recipe: sweet honey cake, poisoned with blood instead of saliva. Then I cut it in half and brought it to my monster.\n\nI expected something awful. A fight that left my bloody shreds ground into the carpet. \n\nBut the monster only smiled. Round, flat eyes the size of dinner plates fixed on the blood cake. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cA special recipe.\u201d I gulped, but the beast was so focused on the cake that it didn\u2019t notice. \u201cJust for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d It opened its mouth.\n\nI placed the cake delicately on its tongue. It chewed eagerly, and shrank. Fat, firm sides caved, ragged rolls of empty flesh falling against its bones.\n\nPain built in my guts and chest, roiling and fluttering. Shivers wracked my spine. My warm, even-keeled peace shrank along with the monster that had granted it, leaving cold desolation in its place. \n\nBy the time the monster shriveled into a flat, boneless mass of dusty fur, I was prostrate on the floor, sobbing. Memories flooded back, pummeling me, leaving me breathless with pain. They pressed against me and threatened to explode *out* of me, pinning me in place. I couldn\u2019t move. I couldn\u2019t even dream of moving.\n\nI could only lay there and hurt.\n\nAfter my dad died, someone told me that pain is a fugue. It\u2019ll break apart eventually, giving way to happiness again the way a nightmare opens to the morning. But my experience is opposite. There is no fugue. Sorrow is sharp, it is devastating, it is painfully present, and sometimes there\u2019s no way out.\n\nThe recipe writer was right. I suffer every day, more than I did before. Like the universe is punishing me for those few months of stolen peace. It\u2019s bad. So bad that sometimes I think I made the wrong choice. \n\nBut then I remember my dad. I remember my mom. I remember our perfect day filled with songs and bad jokes and warm, driving rain. \n\nI remember my dog, nestled in warm, coppery shadows.\n\nAnd even though I hurt, I am okay.\n",

            "comment": "This story couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. I know it\u2019s not about me, but I identify so strongly with the narrator and that overwhelming agony of loss right now that it feels so incredibly personal. The past few weeks have taken me through the anniversaries of three family members\u2019 deaths and one wholly traumatic event, and those wounds that I thought scarred over have been ripped open like they\u2019d never closed in the first place.   \nAnd yet, this story gives me hope. I don\u2019t know why, but it does. Even as I hear my 13-year-old dog snoring in the next room and know that his time is approaching, too, I don\u2019t feel as sad as I did twenty minutes ago. \n\nThank you for sharing. I truly appreciate it. ",

I lost my grandpa who raised me like I was his daughter 2 years ago a week after I got my heart broken and it's still so hard to deal with. Most days I push it all out of my mind but then there's days where everything reminds me of him and I just sit there uncontrollably crying for minutes to hours sometimes they're happy tears other times they're the tears I should have shed the last time I saw him and was able to hold his cold hand and kiss his bloated cheek... I couldn't cry when it was fresh cause I just couldn't bring myself to believe he was actually gone. As I'm typing this I have the most painful lump in my throat and tears are welling up.. I should have mourned him better I should have spent more time with him I should have been a better daughter... I was really into art before he passed and he had asked me to draw him his favorite breed of dog, a Rottweiler, that he would give me $20 for it. I started the drawing for him and told him it was okay that he didn't need to pay me but he gave me $70 I think and told me to take my time on it... I never got to give it to him and it's made it really hard to move into other things.. He believed in me though, in my talent and art.. I loved him so much and he loved me more than anyone I've ever met and I didn't appreciate it fully until my last few days with him.. I regret not being there with him and a lot of things but I'm glad I can remember little things about him and all of the memories of things I thought I forgot. My grandpa was an amazing man.. And some days I wish it didn't hurt so much to think of him but I'd rather hurt than forget him.. Thank you again for such a wonderful story really touched me..",

After being a hell of a mess after my father's death, I decided it was time to change how I behaved and how I surpressed all the bad emotions from years of bullying from the kids in the kindergarten.\n\n Memories should stay where they are, in our mind, in our hearts. NEVER let go of them, they're really precious. Since none of us can change the past, we should embrace it. The thing that keeps me from being empty or sad is the fact, that the person who I am now wouldn't write this message at this moment of time, wouldn't be sitting in school. It wouldn't be me. It would be someone else, who's life is completely different from mine, but I am happy for my life, I don't regret not doing a thing that would've changed my life. I didn't do it and I can't change it. Why bother with it?",

My dog met me in the driveway, prancing and wiggling like he hadn\u2019t seen me for years. Dad cooked an early dinner and told jokes while my mom played her guitar. It rained that night. We went out to the porch, watching palm trees sway as torrents poured down. My dog was scared, so I picked him up and held him as thunder roared.\n\n&gt;Afterward, we ate brownies and ice cream. Then I settled in for the night and read a book until I fell asleep, with my dog cured at my feet.\n\n&gt;As I drifted off, smiling at the memory, I swore I could feel him there: warm and surprisingly heavy, sprawling lazily over my toes.\n\nChrist, this felt like...home.

Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind\" This story was insightful for me considering how I personally viewed it myself. Life is suffering, when you take all the pain away you live in a lie. You need the pain it defines you in ways you don't understand until it's gone. To be honest pain is what made true relationships for me in life compared to happiness. I did need parts of the happiness to relate to people in the end but without feeling that pain I would of never understood the full depth of the relationships I've built. Through pain I found love believe it or not, happiness never built love for me like pain did. The funny part that I enjoyed of this story was the monster stole all her sadness, but her reaction was anger, but a common reaction of anger in some scenarios is reacting to our pain. We use anger to cope with sadness. Now in the story I just genuinely assume she was mad about not being able to feel those memories anymore none the less amazing story 10/10 thank you for this blessing I will take it with me where ever I go.",

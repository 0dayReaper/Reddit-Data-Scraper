    "postText": "I work at a rest-stop diner in a town people pass through as quick as they can on their way to something, or someone, better. It\u2019s called Lucky\u2019s, which is a little ironic because if you\u2019ve ended up here you\u2019re anything but. If you stay too long the dust settles. Working at Lucky\u2019s you never see the same licence plates twice, or faces for that matter. I\u2019ve lost count of the amount of times the answer to my \u201cWhere you heading?\u201d has been \u201cAnywhere but back.\u201d The lights flicker more often than not, and the jukebox sometimes spits out songs that aren't on the index cards, but the coffee\u2019s hot, and most people who try them say the pancakes are the best they\u2019ll ever have, and I\u2019m inclined to agree. \n\nThe embroidered name tag on my uniform reads Isabella, but that ain\u2019t even close to my real name. It was my mom's. Lucky\u2019s has been here a long time. I wear it because I like hearing her name said by other people. It\u2019s like she\u2019s still here, still coming up in conversation. Like she might walk through the door any second and isn\u2019t buried in the cemetery just past the strip club. \n\nLucky\u2019s is also always open. Always. Working long shifts serving drifters and truckers and runaways, those who have become impermanent out on the highways, you get to know how to read people pretty quick. When you move around that much, always on the road, you leave parts of yourself behind sometimes, lost between the miles. Sometimes, people are just driving because there\u2019s nothing else left to do. Working at Lucky\u2019s I\u2019ve seen all sorts of lost things. \n\nI once saw a man hit a deer with his truck and pull over to bury it in the red dirt, digging as the sun went down, tears a steady flow down his face as he fought the ground to cover up what he had done. I once had a man I recognised from the news leave me a blood stained $20 as a tip, sad-eyed in a denim jacket that barely hid the gun taped to his ribs. I once saw a one-armed girl no more than sixteen stand up on the roof of her car and sing, until a coyote came and sat in front of the hood, howling along. I once saw two women fistfight in the parking lot in the night outside, until one was spitting blood and teeth and then they kissed in the blue lights of the police car that happened to pass them by, faces lit up red and shining. \n\nI\u2019ve seen the highway on fire, lines of flames between tires as the asphalt set itself alight in the heat. I\u2019ve seen roadside baptisms, preacher pulled up with a van and a kiddie pool. I\u2019ve seen things walking out in the desert just beyond reach of the neon sign for the motel that don\u2019t look quite like people, shifting out in the blue night. I met a woman who showed me a photograph of the place she was buried. I often meet people who you talk with a while until their faces start to flicker, can\u2019t quite hold up the pretence that long. I\u2019ve met people who have to be invited inside, before they can cross the threshold. I\u2019ve met some lovely members of a sacrificial cult who tipped well and were oh so polite, even when they asked me if I\u2019d consider letting them harvest me. \n\nBut this is a story about - well, you read the title. \n\nIt was a Friday and I was working a night shift. I prefer nights, because when I drive home I can pretend for a while that I\u2019m going to follow the taillights of the car in front until I leave everything in my rearview mirror, until it gets light and the desert changes to ocean, like if I rolled my windows all the way down I\u2019d taste salt on the air. That, and I\u2019m one of the only waitresses, shall we say, qualified, to deal with the night customers. Besides, tips are always better when the moon is out. We only have three true regulars in Lucky\u2019s, and only two had showed so far. \n\nRose-Marie, our first and most frequent regular, was sat by the window in her brown fur coat, always drawn about her shoulders come rain or shine. Not that it ever rained here. Her hair was long and white down her back, like the moon through a glass. She waved over to me, gracing me with a wink that made her crows feet deepen, all the more beautiful for it. Rose-Marie liked whiskey in her tea. Sometimes, she fed cake crumbs to the voodoo dolls she carried in her pockets. She was also a chronic insomniac and liked the company of Lucky\u2019s when sleep was hiding from her. \n\nShe continued to shuffle through the deck of cards she had already set up on the table top. I watched her thumbs flipping over two jokers. Rose-Marie liked to divine the future, when she had the time. She used a frayed pack of hotel playing cards, and if she was in a good mood she\u2019d read your coffee grounds. I didn\u2019t ask her too much, because those coffee grounds had a startling way of coming true. \n\nTable 6 was empty, and spotless as usual. It was the only table without a salt shaker, and the only one I never placed cutlery on. Only one person ever sat there.\n\nOur second regular, Jones, was sat in his usual booth, dregs of his black coffee held tight between his hands, badge resting on the table. He had his eyes closed, head bent down like he was repenting, steam curling off the lip of the mug and wrapping round his fingers. Jones was my favourite of our customers, not that I\u2019d ever tell him. I walked past the booth and slid a bowl of sugar packets along the tabletop until it hit the mug with a soft clink. He jumped, reaching for his holster out of habit, until his eyes focused and he saw me.\n\nHe smiled, embarrassed, and it changed his face, dragging him back to life. When he smiled it was like a storm in a drought, made you want to stand and watch, and maybe stay out in it just a while longer. I wanted to put my hands over his where they had resumed their place on the mug, to feel the second hand heat through his palms. \n\nSometimes I can sense the sad in people just by the feel of their skin. They carry it around with them, bone deep, trying to hide it from the world. But sometimes you can lift it from them for a minute or two, if you have enough kindness spare. It doesn\u2019t take much, most times. Jones was too young to be that sad. And yet. \n\n\u201cTired today?\u201d I gestured with the coffee pot to his half empty cup. Everyone knew about the little girl he\u2019d pulled from the dumpsters outside the swimming pool last week. She was the fifth one missing in three months. I could tell from the shadows like purple thumb prints beneath his eyes he\u2019d been dreaming about her. She\u2019d been found without her shoes on. He\u2019d carried her to the ambulance in her socks, pink with little daisies on \u2018em, small in his arms like she was asleep.  \n\nLou the fry cook had cried when I\u2019d told him that the other day. I really liked Lou. He was almost too big to fit through the service door, and had a tattoo of his dog just below the one of the angel of death on his shoulder. Lou sheds a tear for most things. The dead racoons we\u2019re always finding by the backdoor with their hands missing. Whenever there\u2019s a new missing poster plastered over the cracked glass of the phone booth in the parking lot. Every time he hears I Will Forever Hate Roses when it decides to pop up on the jukebox. Big guy, bigger heart. \n\n\u201cAlways tired,\u201d Jones said as I poured. Another girl had gone missing yesterday. As I poured, I made sure to brush his thumb where it rested on the cup handle with the inside of my wrist, lifting out that sadness as far as I could. He smiled up at me, shy, and I smiled back before I could stop myself. \n\nI walked on to the next booth, two truckers with faces that had seen too much sun. One was showing the other the photos of his new baby in his wallet. He had tobacco stained teeth, a scab on his cheek and wind-chapped lips - and his smile was the most beautiful damn thing as he talked about his kid, lit up like christmas morning. He showed me too as I refilled his coffee, and I stayed and talked to them a while. \n\nThe other trucker, with gold back teeth, told me how he\u2019d used to drive pigs, but couldn't handle the guilt when he handed them over to the slaughterhouse. Said he\u2019d look right into their pink faces through the slats and their eyes looked right back, bright and pleading like they knew what he\u2019d done. Said he still dreamt about them. Now he drove freezers of seafood, specialty deliveries for fancy hotels. He\u2019d never seen the ocean. \n\nLou slammed the bell from the depths of the kitchen and I got back to work, taking orders from a woman with a Labrador who ordered hot dogs for them both, and three teenage boys in their blood-stained varsity jackets in the corner, who had ten dollars between them and asked for as many waffles as they could get. \n\nThey often came in on full moons, leaving their bikes chained up in the parking lot. They were always hunting something, with their baseball bats, backpacks filled with bullets and their daddies\u2019 guns, but they were nice kids so I always gave them extra scoops of ice-cream. Besides, I knew they needed the energy, because when they were hunting they had to run fast. Real fast. There used to be four of them. \n\nI cleared the table from the two women at the next booth on my way back. They looked to be twins, both dressed in long silk skirts and hiking boots, red hair piled up messy on top of their heads. \n\nNeither acknowledged me, not out of rudeness but because they were too preoccupied, packing up their bags, overspilling with maps and notebooks. I spied a roll of duct tape and a bottle of vodka in there too, along with some stakes and crucifixes. They were deep in conversation, waving their hands and I caught a little of it as I stacked their empty glasses, lipsticked round the rims. \n\n\u201cI know where I buried him Sylvia-,\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know jackshit! We dug for hours, and-\u201d\n\nMy mom always taught me eavesdropping was rude, so I left them to it and headed into the kitchen. But I got the sense that wherever they had left, whoever he was, he certainly wasn\u2019t there no more. I felt like telling them, but like my mom said, it\u2019s not polite to listen to other people\u2019s conversations. You never know what you\u2019ll wish you hadn\u2019t heard. \n\nLou was dancing to the radio, swaying his hips to Sugar Hill as Dolly sang down the wires. He waved at me with the spatula he was using as a microphone. \n\nCarlos handed me a plate of pancakes. \n\nCarlos had worked here so long he\u2019d known my Mom, and was the only one who new my real name. He sometimes came with me on the weekends to change the flowers on her grave. He always brought her desert flowers, growing from the same earth she was. Carlos was also the only one who knew the recipe for the Lucky\u2019s pancakes, and the only one that could cook them right. On days when he wasn\u2019t working, we had no pancakes. Simple as. That was just the way it went. I\u2019d learnt that the hard way, but that\u2019s another story. \n\nAlong with the pancakes, came a warning. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s back.\u201d He gestured through the doors. \u201cTable 6.\u201d \n\nOur final regular had showed. It had been a while since he\u2019d been around. I hadn\u2019t even seen him come in, but that wasn\u2019t unusual. He moved in mysterious ways. I raised an eyebrow. Shit. Carlos raised one back. Oh shit. He tossed me the salt with a grimace, and I filled the pockets of my apron. Lou banged around in one of the staff lockers for a moment, until he emerged triumphant, waving a bible that had definitely seen better days. He placed in on the counter next to the syrup jugs and flipped to a random page. \n\nWe leant over his huge shoulders to read what it said. \u201cKeep far from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent and righteous, for I will not acquit the wicked.\u201d Lou shrugged and patted me on the shoulder.\n\nI don\u2019t get paid enough for this shit. \n\nI took the pancakes to table 6, which had been empty the last time I\u2019d looked. It was now very much occupied. The man sat at table 6 was smiling as I walked over. If you could call it a smile. It was more like rictus, lips straining deep red at the corners of his face. His eyes kept darting from side to side, too fast to count, like his pupils couldn't make up their mind where they should be. His hands shook as I got closer, hovering like flies on a carcass.  \n\nI tried to lean as far away from him as I could as I placed the plate on the tabletop, but as I pulled my hands away he darted his neck out fast, whipping his head up and tilting his face towards me. He sniffed in, hard, eyelids fluttering. He giggled, shrill like it was stuck on the roof of his mouth. I recoiled, trying to hide the urge I had to run back to the kitchen. There\u2019s something about hearing a grown man giggle that makes the skin crawl. \n\n\u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d I asked, faking bright. \n\n\u201cI\u2019d take your name.\u201d He gripped one of the pancakes in his fist, turning it to mush. \n\nI tapped the name tag on my uniform. He shook his head, grinning, shoulders almost vibrating with this strange fluid roll as his smile slipped for a second, front teeth jutting suddenly, tongue sharply poking out. Filth was caked under his nails, red like the dirt on the sides of the road. Then he was smiling again, swaying slowly from side to side, feral, in his hunting jacket. His hair hung in greasy strings around his ears, like blonde rattails, and they swung with him, back and forth. \n\n\u201cIsabella, Isabella, Isabella. It don\u2019t suit.\u201d He suddenly slammed his hand up to his face, shovelling the crushed pancake into the gaping hole of his wide mouth. I jerked back, the movement was so sudden. I shoved my hands into my apron, reaching for the salt, and his eyes narrowed. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that,\u201d came a voice from behind me. It rolled across my shoulders, deep, to the bone. Mr Prince. \n\nI turned to face our third regular, relief mixing with fear in a swirling pit in my chest. Kinda like that feeling you get at a fairground in midsummer, when you\u2019ve been on a carousel too long, and part of you knows you need to get off, but the other part doesn\u2019t want to leave because you know as soon as you stand still you\u2019re gonna be sick. Mr. Prince had that effect on people. \n\nMr. Prince was dressed, as always, in his black pinstripe. His stetson was darker than the night outside, and his boots shone like they were wet. If you didn\u2019t notice the upside down crucifixes embroidered daintily onto his custom lapels, you\u2019d think he was just a man with money, maybe mixed up in something a little shady, like oil, or pharmaceuticals. He was handsome by the way of his jaw, with his bone white smile, but his black sunglasses were balanced on the bridge of his nose, silver rimmed and gleaming, hiding his eyes as usual. When he spoke it was a drawl, dragged up from the depths of the South. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for my\u2026 acquaintance. He\u2019s a little\u2026\u201d Mr Prince glanced at the man sat at table 6 as he panted with his tongue hung out, like a dog. \u201c\u2026over excited.\u201d Mr Prince sat down and the lights above the booth flickered. He tilted his hat back on his head and the jukebox coughed and skipped, and suddenly Robert Johnson was on and singing about that damn crossroad again. Mr Prince popped a Marlboro Red between his teeth, and pushed the window open a sliver with the knuckles of his left hand. The silver pentagram ring on his wedding finger clacked against the glass.  \n\nMr. Prince smiled, the way snakes do when they\u2019re watching you from the grass on their bellies. The cigarette was now smoking between his teeth, although he hadn\u2019t moved. \n\n\u201cBesides, Leroy ain\u2019t the type for salt. He\u2019s just a man.\u201d He looked him up and down and his top lip curled. \u201cBarely.\u201d He turned to Leroy. \u201cI see you started on my pancakes. But what\u2019s the point of good food if it ain\u2019t for sharing.\u201d Leroy giggled that strange high sound that made me want to run, and shook a little. Everything about Leroy made me nervous, fight or flight getting ready to flood my system. \n\nMr Prince handed Leroy a menu. \u201cOrder whatever you want.\u201d He leant forward and the lights flickered.\n\nLeroy ordered four cheeseburgers, and glass of milk. \u201cWell, if that\u2019s all!\u201d I managed. I could feel Leroy\u2019s eyes clinging to my back as I left. Rose-Marie waved me over before I could get back to the safety of the kitchen. \n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about him, darlin\u2019.\u201d She crossed herself, and tapped the card on top of the pile. The Jack of Spades. It had its eyes scratched out. But not by Rose-Marie. It looked like it had been printed that way for years. \u201cWe won\u2019t be seeing him again.\u201d She wasn\u2019t talking about Mr. Prince. She cupped my cheek and I leant into it, her hand rough with age, but warm. I could tell she thought I looked tired. She paid for her tea and toast, and walked out into the warm night waiting outside the doors.  \n\nI finally made it back into the kitchen and was immediately attacked. Cold water doused me in the face and I threw up my arms on instinct, trying to protect my hair. Lou aggressively squirted me in the face with the spray bottle we also kept in the staff locker, the kind you use for tending house plants. Ours was filled with holy water. \n\n\u201cLou! Jesus fuckin\u2019 Christ, get off I\u2019m-\u201c I sputtered, and he sprayed me again. I spat holy water out, dripping down the front of my dress and wiped it from my eyes, makeup running a little. I grabbed the bottle from his hands. \u201cI think I\u2019m good.\u201d I wasn\u2019t really mad though, better safe than sorry, especially when it comes to possession. \n\n\u201cSorry! Just checkin\u2019.\u201d Lou sheepishly handed me a dish towel. \u201cAlready did me \u2019n\u2019 Carlos.\u201d He looked down at his shoes, awkward. He was a foot taller than me and a decade older, and I hid my smile because he was twisting the toe of his boot back and forth like a little kid been kept after class.\n\nCarlos kept his eyes firmly fixed on his hands as he started flipping patties, but I could sense him holding back a laugh, desperately clenching his teeth. I narrowed my eyes and aimed the spray bottle at him. \u201cMaybe you need some more,\u201d I threatened. Lou snorted and then Carlos was laughing and I was too, and that heavy feeling that had hovered over us since Mr. Prince had walked in lifted. \n\nSometimes when things get too dark, all you can do is laugh. Mom always said that when shit gets rough, you can either choose to laugh or cry. I never saw my mother cry.\n\nIt was coming up on 3 in the morning as I took the burgers back to table 6. Leroy visibly drooled and clapped his hands as I walked over. I put the plate in front of him as quick as I could but as I pulled back, his head darted forward and he licked the inside of my wrist. His tongue was long and wet against my pulse. I recoiled like I\u2019d been bitten and he laughed, shrill and manic. \n\n\u201cYou taste better than they will,\u201d he said, grinning and gesturing to the burgers. Mr. Prince watched this unfold, calm and unreadable like the sky before summer lighting burns down a tree. I frantically wiped my arm on my apron, but I could still feel that tongue on my skin as if I\u2019d left my hand in his mouth. I fought off the tears that suddenly burned at the corners of my eyes, because something told me Leroy would enjoy them just a little too much. I shuddered, and cleared Mr. Prince\u2019s plate.\n\n\u201cTell Carlos the pancakes were\u2026 good as hell,\u201d he said, from behind his sunglasses. Then he chuckled, low and raspy, as if something he\u2019d said was funny. He popped another Marlbro between his teeth and it started to glow, as Leroy shovelled meat down his throat. I tried not to gag as I watched it clog beneath his long nails.\n\nI walked by Jones on my way back. He waved me over, eyes creased with worry. He ran a hand over his face, as if he was trying to wipe all the bad things away.\n\n\u201cIs he botherin\u2019 you?\u201d He gestured over to Leroy who was rocking back and forth drinking his milk. Jones suddenly looked so tired, uniform creased as his face, looking fifty instead of his twenty two.\n\u201cNothing I can\u2019t handle,\u201d I shook my head and thought about Rose-Marie. \u201cWe won\u2019t be seeing him again.\u201d \n\nIt felt like hours waiting for Leroy to finish. I took the order of a man with a butterfly tattooed on his neck, and some truckers pouring Jim Beam into their coffee. They asked me for an extra cup which they placed at the empty seat on their table, for absent friends, they said. I cleaned down the counter top, restocked the sugar packets, and took out the trash, ignoring the man in the rabbit mask that often waits out by the dumpsters. As long as you don\u2019t look at him, he doesn\u2019t bother you. I refilled coffee cups, and took the orders of the large group of biker girls that came in, leather clad and road weary. \n\nAt 3:03am, Mr. Prince stood. Leroy had licked his plate clean and was sitting still, staring up at him with his teeth bared in a smile, hands gripping the table top so hard his knuckles were going white as milk. Mr. Prince handed me a roll of bills wrapped in black plastic that I knew better than to count. He tipped his hat. \n\n\u201cSee Leroy. We all gotta pay eventually,\u201d he said. He leaned in and spoke softly. \u201cFor I will not acquit the wicked,\u201d he smiled. He held out his hand to Leroy, palm flat, waiting. Leroy\u2019s hands shook as he reached into his hunting jacket and pulled out a pair of shoes. A child\u2019s shoes, small enough that both could fit in one hand. Little pink sneakers, dirty, with brown stains on the toes that I knew could only be one thing. Mr Prince considered them a moment, under the lights, and shook his head. \n\nHe seemed like he was sorry, before he handed them to me. \u201cFor your man over there. Tell him to dig deeper where they looked last.\u201d  He nodded to Jones, who was watching us, his badge gripped in his hand. But Jones knew better than to come over. \n\nMr. Prince turned to Leroy and grinned around his cigarette. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a ways to go, the road we\u2019re takin\u2019. They say it\u2019s paved with good intentions.\u201d He chuckled, and I felt sick to my stomach. He took Leroy\u2019s hand, like a child, and they walked out into the night, warm and waiting. The doors swung shut behind them, even though nobody had touched them. The jukebox sputtered, and Chris Rea was on, singing about that road again. \n\nI placed the shoes on the table by Jone\u2019s empty coffee cup, and passed on the message. He sat still for a long time after, just watching them on the table top, trying not to cry or scream or punch a hole in the plaster. All I could do was refill his coffee, because when someone is trying to hold themselves together like that, there\u2019s nothing left to say. \n\nMy shift ended, and I drove myself home, following the taillights in front of me. I knew when I woke up it would be dark, and it would be time for my next shift, but for now, I just drove, dreaming about the ocean and watching the sun come up, like it always does, despite everything.",

I only found out they were a real creature fairly recently, and I absolutely cannot believe there's such a thing as a dog that looks exactly like a raccoon.\n\n\nHere, I'll leave you with this:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2Mm1sFZoYw\n\n\nWho could hate that???",

If the devil as in lucifer fallen angel and stuff really exists than its entirely possible that he just watches over the damned souls. I mean the further you go back in history diffrent religions portray the same character differently and the older it gets the more is the devil the good guy for humanity. Arguing with God about giving humanity free will or just wanting free will himself. Giving humanity wisdom through the apple and stuff like that. The Devil in greek mythology is hades and he just watched over the dead but is also the most hated Hel daughter of Loki in Norse mythology also portrays the same person and she isn't evil either then we go back early versions of what will later be Christians and so on. And there the devil fell because he wanted what humans have from the start. Free will. Choice for himself. And does that make him evil? But then again in other versions the devil is the reason we have free will ourselfs so can a being that in most versions of its story fight for free will be evil?",

To do does not require free will.  \nA leaf does not choose to fall, but it falls from a tree.  A sentient being can choose words for a conversation.  \nJust because you are alive does not mean everything you did was your choice.  People don't generally choose their emotions or what kind of home they're born into.  \nBut as humans, taking responsibility is a confession of choice.  No choice, \"no free will in the matter,\" no responsibility.  One can always claim they were not responsible, but it may or may not be true.  \nI might be missing your point, in which case I need an explanation on how choice and free will could possibly be divorced.  As far as I can tell, if free will is an illusion, choice is an illusion, and therefore we are not actually responsible for our actions.",

Your choices are made even before they enter your awareness, is that freedom? Are you truly choosing anything? An awareness of what is going on does not mean you control what is going on.\n\nHow does this fit with physics? All of our brain matter, is composed of particles, be it molecules, atoms, ions, or electrons. These are all subject to the laws of physics, specifically the motion of particles, that are caused by forces outside of your ability to control. Free will and physics are incompatible. If they are not, and you assert this to be true, then you must provide experimental evidence, or at the very least, show me a mathematical framework that incorporates the concious mind. \n\nYou cannot determine your experiences or desires or literally any aspect of yourself that is responsible for those choices. Your brain is simply following a pattern that is caused by the laws of physics. It's following its programming. Being aware of that does not give you choice. \n\nIf we have free will, then if i were to wind the clock back to before you made a certain choice, could you have acted differently? Absolutely not. All the molecules and atoms and particles that compose your brain are the same as they were just before making the first choice. It would violate the laws of physics if you were able to choose differently, and again, you would have to show this to be true experimentally. \n\nAnother thing to add, the existence of a choice doesnt mean we are the authors of that choice. We act according to what we want, but we do not choose what we want. Free will cannot logically exist, it cannot exist according to physics, and scientific experiment verifies this. \n\nI'm not convinced by your argument.",

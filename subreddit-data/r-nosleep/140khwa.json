    "postText": "If I\u2019d only followed my instincts, I\u2019d never have boarded that doomed ship. When the Azure Seastar left port, its passengers were all alive, each with smart phones and watches and tablets, as well as the cruise ship\u2019s own communications\u2026 yet not a single message was sent before it went missing! No distress call.\n\nThe fates of over a thousand passengers and crew remain unknown, with only a handful recovered from a lifeboat, days after the Seastar herself vanished. But the coast guard\u2019s only statement on the lifeboat\u2019s recovery was that \u201cthe passengers did not survive.\u201d Rumors circulated about a \u201cthermos full of eyeballs\u201d and a \u201cpassenger whose mouth was stuffed full of severed fingers\u201d\u2014but these details have been denounced as lies, sensationalizing and capitalizing on a tragedy.\n\nThe *official* cause of the Seastar\u2019s disappearance is a rogue wave. No survivors. No witnesses.\n\nWell\u2026 *one* witness\u2026\n\n\u2026 but perhaps I shouldn\u2019t tell. Better for the world if that ship stay lost forever!\n\nThe families of the missing, however, deserve the truth\u2026 which is why I am posting.\n\nBut first, a warning\u2014the gruesome snippets I recounted above barely scratch the surface of the horror I am about to share, some of which I took part in. I wake screaming every night. I sleep with the lights on. I never enter darkened hallways or stairwells. And I do not *ever* shake hands. Although I\u2019ve always had some quirks (the handshake one is an old habit), most of these are fresh, a consequence of my time aboard that doomed cruise ship. I do not intend to gloss over any details, but rather to give a complete accounting, including of my own involvement\u2026 so be forewarned.\n\nAnd understand that my story is one of unimaginable horror.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nTo explain what really happened aboard the Seastar, I need to first tell a little about myself. Sorry, I know I\u2019m like a bit of decorative wallpaper\u2014just sort of there. But I *see* things.\n\nIt all started when I was very young (I do promise this is relevant). I didn\u2019t want to swim in the community pool with my brother because the water was cloudy, hiding a shadowy figure in the deep end. I distinctly remember standing at the pool\u2019s edge, crying inconsolably while my father urged, \u201cGo on, jump in!\u201d\n\nMy brother set the example, diving down to the bottom of the foggy water. When he came up, a silver dollar glinted in his fingers, which he dropped back into the pool before I could snatch it. \u201cOops! Guess you gotta dive for it!\u201d He laughed, the sun shimmering off his sunburned shoulders. \u201cCome on, there\u2019s quarters down here, too!\u201d\n\nDiving for coins was a game we often played, so I plunged in after him, kicking my way down with my eyes squeezed shut. When my hands grazed the rough cement bottom, I patted around.\n\nSilky hair tangled around my fingers like seaweed.\n\nI forced my eyes open against the stinging chlorine\u2014and shrieked.\n\nWide, empty eyes stared back at me from a bloated face.\n\nWhen I shot to the surface, wailing about a dead woman in the water, other swimmers looked on, perplexed. My older brother tried to console me and swore there were nothing but coins.\n\nHe was correct\u2014not until a week later would a woman drown in that pool, and sink to the bottom of the foggy water while swimmers unwittingly raced laps above her.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe next time I *saw* was when I threw a tantrum over my grandmother\u2019s armchair. It smelled so bad I grabbed my nose and exclaimed, \u201cEwwww!\u201d\n\nMy parents scolded me for my rudeness. Grandma occasionally struggled with incontinence, so for her chair to stink was, they assumed, the result of an accident. They thought I was exaggerating to make fun of her, but in the sweltering summer, the smell was truly unbearable\u2014like rotting meat and diarrhea and cheap perfume all churned together. I threw such a fit we left, though Grandma insisted on hugging me despite my being an \u201cawful brat.\u201d Her skin was wrinkled, papery-thin and soft as silk, but despite the uncomfortable warmth of her apartment, her embrace was ice cold.\n\nLess than a week later the call came. My grandmother had been found after a neighbor\u2019s complaint about the smell\u2026\n\nShe\u2019d died in her chair.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBut when the *seeing* really clicked was in my tween years, two separate incidents. The first was after a classmate of my brother\u2019s pulled up in a car reeking of burnt meat, the interior charred and black. He stepped out of the car seeming not to notice that behind him, another version of him remained belted into the front seat, unrecognizable through the char beyond the glint of a gold chain melted into his neck. I burst into hysterical tears and screamed at my brother not to let him drive. The classmate laughed and called me a weirdo.\n\nHe crashed later that week.\n\nThe second incident began at a school function, where my brother chaperoned me. A man pulled up in the school drop-off zone\u2014he was one of the more popular teachers, famous for his yearly pizza parties. In the car with him were two young kids. I can\u2019t remember their names, just that the littlest boy was giggling and clinging to a toy T-rex when he hopped out. My brother and I were asked to help carry the party supplies and drinks from the teacher\u2019s car. But the moment I opened the passenger door to grab a box, the reek of fetid pond water made my stomach lurch. I staggered back, clapping a hand to my nose and mouth.\n\n\u201cHey! Everything all right?\u201d the teacher asked.\n\nMy brother, no doubt remembering what happened to his classmate weeks earlier, took me aside.\n\n\u201cC-c-c-c-cold!\u201d I burst to him. \u201cD-dark! The smell! Like the rot in the bottom of a lake\u2026\u201d\n\nWhile I wrung my hands and sniffled, my brother watched the two young kids follow the teacher into the school. He shook my shoulder and said, \u201cHey\u2014hey, we\u2019re going to save them.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow? No one ever believes me!\u201d\n\n\u201c*I* believe you, Hope. Hey\u2026\u201d He gave me a squeeze and looked in my eyes. \u201c\u2018Hope\u2019 is the thing with feathers\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat a dork. That line was from Emily Dickinson\u2014my brother\u2019s favorite quote for me for when I was upset. It was corny, but encouraged me.\n\nA few minutes later, we were careening along backwoods roads in the teacher\u2019s car. To this day, I don\u2019t know how my brother got the keys. His plan was we\u2019d stow the car in a garage for a couple weeks, long enough to outlast the vision, since my predictions always came true within about six days. But it hadn\u2019t occurred to either of us how being *inside* the car would affect me. The damp and rot washed over my skin. *COLD.* Every hair on my body stood erect, floating as if underwater. I couldn\u2019t breathe\u2026 gagging on the fetid water, I rolled down my window. Raindrops from outside pelted my face, and something\u2026 something clicked. A sudden terrible question. When I\u2019d peered into the darkened interior, I hadn\u2019t been able to see\u2026 *who was inside the car?*\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d my brother said, apparently struck by the same thought. \u201cYou\u2019re not foreseeing *our* deaths, are you?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know if it was fate that caused us to fishtail just as he spoke. But also he might have hit something, because there was a bump. All I know is suddenly we were flying, off the road and over the side toward a lake, and then plunging, and I snatched for his hand as the impact slammed us forward into the dashboard. Then the water wasn\u2019t just in my mind. It was *real.* It was pouring in through the car window.\n\nI fought, flailing. Unbuckled. Floundered through the half-open window. Luckily I was still small enough to get through, swimming up and breaking the surface.\n\n\u201cCory!\u201d I screamed. \u201c*CORY!!!\u201d*\n\nBut I knew already that my brother wasn\u2019t coming up\u2014his hand had been cold when I\u2019d touched it.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nNaturally, his death feels like my fault. Oh, in kinder moments I remember that I was a child, and try to forgive myself for letting him get behind that wheel. But for a time, I was driven by the fierce need to atone. I sought desperately to save even *one* life\u2026 *ANY* life. I\u2019d see a body swaying from a beam in a construction site. Legs dangling from a trunk in the car on the highway ahead of me. A suitcase on sale in a luggage store, dripping blood. *Every time* I tried to prevent the death\u2026 only to fail or worse, *cause* it. Each loss drove home more deeply my shame, my failure\u2026 until eventually\u2026\n\nI gave up.\n\nI don\u2019t try to prevent the deaths anymore. These days I catch a whiff of that familiar sickly putrid scent, and I leave. I avoid human touch, especially handshakes.\n\nI\u2019ve truly become wallpaper. Able to *see.* Powerless to prevent.\n\nMy name, incidentally, is Cassandra\u2026 I changed it because I could no longer bear my birth name. If \u201cHope\u201d is the thing with feathers, I was an angel of death, harbinger of doom to my brother and others. So instead I call myself after the Greek priestess doomed to foresee the future but never to be believed\u2026 unable to prevent even one single tragedy.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBut let\u2019s get back to the cruise. The missing passengers. The eyeballs in the thermos\u2014oh, those grisly details! Mind you, once you know you can\u2019t un-know, no matter how much you drink, or smoke, or however you drown your despair. Speaking of drowning, a month ago today, I hit the big 4-O. I celebrated my four decades of life by doing the one thing I\u2019ve done consistently since I was old enough\u2014drinking away my failures. Every icy grip. Every unheeded warning. And especially the times I\u2019ve well and truly fucked up. Oh yes. Those are the ones that call for some hard forgetting.\n\nI was on my second or seventh drink at my favorite bar when a voice exclaimed, \u201c\u2019Evening, friend!\u201d\n\nA woman with shimmering purple eyeliner and matching purple hair approached. It was the musician who often played there, Lily Tsuki. To be honest, she was the primary reason I frequented that bar, though we\u2019d hardly spoken beyond my occasional compliments about her playing. She slid into the seat next to mine and clinked my glass.\n\n\u201cRoy at the bar told me it\u2019s your fortieth. I see you in here once a week, always tipping well and drinking like you\u2019re trying to drown yourself. Someone did something kind for me recently, so I\u2019m trying to pass it on\u2026\u201d She fished a hand into her pocket, and to my surprise produced a gift card for a cruise. I didn\u2019t catch all of her story in the noisy bar, but apparently, one of her admirers was very rich, always offering her gifts verging on inappropriate. After finding out she\u2019d be playing on the Azure Seastar, said admirer sent her the card so she could spoil herself on the cruise. She didn\u2019t feel comfortable accepting, so she gifted it to me. \u201c\u2026 There\u2019s enough on there to cover your fare. Don\u2019t thank me\u2014thank *you,* I needed to get rid of it. Enjoy your fortieth, friend!\u201d\n\nAs she handed me the card, her fingers brushed mine.\n\nWarm. Alive.\n\nI mumbled my thanks, cheeks warm. Why? Because she chose me? Blushes! I\u2019m an idiot.\n\nStill, I was glowing, and not just because I was tipsy. *Why not?* I thought. *Why not treat myself, this once?* The Azure Seastar\u2026 it sounded like a dream. I\u2019d go see Lily Tsuki play at the piano bar against the backdrop of a glimmering ocean. I\u2019d drink under the stars. Get a tan. Get my sea legs! And every hand would be warm and every breath would taste of the summer breeze!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nNine decks (eleven including the crew-only levels). Over a thousand people. Pool, bars, restaurants, lounges, caf\u00e9s, spa, cabaret\u2014the Seastar truly was the Ritz Carlton on the water! I was absolutely giddy! Of course before the luxury came the wait\u2014just like the airport, parking, luggage, ticketing, security. It was as I neared the entrance for ticketing, enjoying the summer breeze, that I caught traces of a sour odor\u2026 a whiff of decay\u2026 so faint beneath the car exhaust and the smell of the saltwater that I might have missed it, were I not so attuned to death. At port, it was likely some unfortunate animal packed into a shipping crate and decomposing. I\u2019d even read horror stories of people, trafficked in sealed shipping containers and asphyxiating. That faint whiff made my insides curdle.\n\nThen I was inside the air conditioned terminal, packed with passengers\u2014and inhaling nothing but the blessed AC.\n\nThe check in was surprisingly quick. I followed the embarkation signs up the escalator to the terminal\u2019s upper level, through the double glass doors, greeted on my right by printed images of pool decks and steaks and wine glasses. On my left, through the enormous paned wall of glass, the Seastar herself loomed. My God, she was enormous!\n\nSo many decks! So many balconies!\n\nThen I squinted a little closer. What was that speck? A tiny figure, draped on a railing?\n\nMy heart dropped to my toes.\n\nSomething was horribly wrong.\n\nThe figure, small against the massive width of the ship\u2026 had no face. Only a torso and most of its arms. It had been decapitated, and dried blood spattered the rail.\n\nMy footsteps slowed. I pressed against the glass, eyes rapidly roving the rest of the ship. Was it just one\u2026? One incidence of violence, or\u2026\n\nPerhaps I wasn\u2019t seeing correctly. It was a stunt. A practical joke. A mannequin. I needed to get closer. I hurried along the terminal, joining the line out to the gangplank.\n\nThe bowl of the sky had turned deep purple, the sun lowering toward the horizon, and in the Seastar\u2019s deep shadow, the temperature dropped. A sudden chill gripped me as I trotted out onto the gangplank. I sniffed. Sniffed again, more deeply.\n\n*Rot.*\n\nThe same putrid odor I\u2019d caught outside. A passenger ahead of me noticed me grabbing my nose, and remarked, \u201cNot used to that ocean smell?\u201d I did not respond, because now that I was close enough to see the ship more clearly, I noticed\u2026 cracked glass\u2026 broken panes in the sliding glass doors of the cabins\u2026 *no!* I gasped, sinking to my knees, and the passenger kindly leaned to help me up. As her hand seized mine\u2014it was *cold.*\n\nI jerked back so fast I actually collapsed into the passengers behind us\u2014a mother and her daughter.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d exclaimed the mother.\n\nMy hand brushed the daughter\u2019s bare arm. *Cold.*\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d asked the daughter, a child of about twelve.\n\nI crawled back from her, and another person, an elderly gentleman, leaned down to help me up, his hand on my elbow. *Cold!*\n\n\u201cMiss?\u201d he asked. \u201cMiss\u2014\u201d But I bolted, barely hearing their cries as I launched myself back toward the terminal. No no no no no no no no\u2014my eyes watered and my belly bunched into knots and my heart lurched into my throat and oh God oh God\u2014the *ship!* The whole. Entire. Ship. It was\u2026 dark\u2026 windows broken\u2026 Not a single light shining in the interior, and spatters of blood here and there visible on its decks and balconies\u2026 But worst of all was the smell. I hadn\u2019t even entered the ship yet and already I knew, *knew,* in the way only *I* can know, that the smell wasn\u2019t just one body or two. Not if I could detect it all the way out on the gangplank. All the way at the entrance to the terminal. For the whiff of putrefaction to have spread so far, the source was something *massive.* A colossal pile of decomposing bodies like a herd of dead elephants.\n\nThat ship\u2026 no one on that ship was going to make it back\u2026\n\nAs I entered the terminal with its blessed filtered air and the windows between me and the ship, I turned and looked at the line stretching behind me. Passengers laughing. Chatting. Dressed in their finest. Flirting. Teasing. Buzzing with excitement. Old and young couples. Children.\n\n*Everyone on this ship is going to die\u2026*\n\n*... and I\u2019m the only one* [*who knows\u2026*](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)\n\n[\\[Part 2\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/142z4tp/i_went_on_a_cruise_and_found_the_source_of_the/) [\\[Part 3\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/144ahip/i_went_on_a_cruise_and_one_passenger_didnt_belong/)",

I am a little confused about the incident that happened to your brother, though. You said you knew your brother wasn\u2019t going to make it out alive because his hands had been cold. A part of me wonders when his hands turned cold. If you were foreseeing his death, his hands might\u2019ve turned cold after you told him about the vision. You just hadn\u2019t realized it or didn\u2019t notice or weren\u2019t able to tell until you grabbed onto his hand when it was already too late to prevent it from happening, right? Or maybe his hands didn\u2019t turn cold until you both were already in the car and he asked you that question before hitting that bump. If you had really been foreseeing the teacher\u2019s death, or the death of the two kids, or maybe both the teacher and the kids, telling your brother prevented their deaths, but at the cost of his. Either way, someone would\u2019ve died. Being able to see who had been in the car would\u2019ve helped. But because you hadn\u2019t been able to tell at the time of the vision, there was no way you could\u2019ve prevented it from happening unless you told the teacher and two kids about it and your brother helped explain things and they believed you, I suppose. Whatever happened that night, it wasn\u2019t your fault. \n\nAnd with the cruise ship, even if you were able to stop all those deaths from happening, it might only delay the inevitable. Or if it doesn\u2019t happen to them, it will probably end up happening to someone else instead. So either way, preventing these things from happening is probably impossible. So don\u2019t ever blame yourself when these things happen because there probably is no way to stop it from happening anyway, as sad as that is.\n\nEither way, I believe you, OP.",

When did his hand become cold? Who would I have seen in the backseat, if I had been able to see? Was his hand cold earlier in the week? I truly can\u2019t remember if I touched him at all before we fishtailed out of control. And so I don\u2019t know if his hand was cold all along, or if it *became* cold when he got into the car.

    "postText": "First post- https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13wy7qb/i_was_a_lab_assistant_of_sorts/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\n\nHey guys, I\u2019m back again with an update.\n\nIt\u2019s been a couple of days and the food is just about gone. Luckily, there\u2019s a sink in the corner so I don\u2019t have to worry about water. It tastes a little metaly but it hasn\u2019t made me puke so I guess it\u2019s fine. For some reason, there\u2019s a bag of cat food in the corner so I guess if it comes down to it I can eat that.\n\nOkay, now onto what you\u2019re all really interested in.\n\nThe little potato dude is okay. He\u2019s still a weird little guy, but I haven\u2019t had to smash him yet. I know what he eats now, but that's getting ahead of myself a bit. We\u2019ve come to an understanding but it definitely took us some time to get there.\n\nThe first day was the worst.\n\nAs I tried to find ways out of the little room, the little guy just kept screaming to be let out. The longer he screamed, the more he started to sound like a baby crying for food. I swear I could hear him through my headphones, and after they died, I was stuck with just the sound of him crying. I alternated between charging my phone and charging my earbud case, but sometimes I was still left listening to the little guy scream. \n\nHe cried till about midnight, and that's when I almost snapped.\n\nI picked up the tank, now more like a fish tank and less like a jar, and stared through the glass at him. I must have been pretty scary because he stopped yelling and just stared back at me with his multiple eyes. He had so many, they were all over his body, and we had a little staring contest before I finally told him to shut up.\n\n\u201cOr else I will smash your little tank and squish you like a bug.\u201d\n\nHe seemed to think about that, and when he nodded it was like his whole body nodding.\n\nWe had some silence after that as the two of us sat and made our little plans. I thought about calling campus security, but when I tried, they just thought I was goofing. I tried to explain to them where I was and what was going on, but they just told me not to play games and hung up on me. I tried 911 again, but they said the same thing. Heck, the lady on the 911 call threatened to call the police if I kept calling, and I told her to go right ahead. Maybe the police could find me better than campus security, but since they haven\u2019t broken down the door yet, I guess not.\n\nIt was about three am when I finally thought to look at the tank and found him watching me.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d I asked, making the little guy jump, \u201cHave you got any ideas?\u201d\n\nHe seemed to think about it, but before he could say it, I cut him off.\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t say let you out of the tank.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d he said, \u201cIn that case, I have nothing to add yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cTerrific!\u201d I said, putting my head in my hands and staring at the floor.\n\n\u201cHave you, perhaps, thought about vents or drains?\u201d \n\nI had, but they were all too small for me to climb into. There was a drain in the floor but I couldn\u2019t even get a foot in there. The ventilation shafts were an idea, but most of them would be too snug for me. I\u2019m a beefy guy, not muscular but kinda fat, and getting stuck in the vents sounded like a terrible way to die without anyone realizing it.\n\n\u201cYeah, obviously. I\u2019m too big to fit through those.\u201d\n\n\u201cA problem I do not have.\u201d the creature reminded me, more than a little smugly too.\n\n\u201cBack to that again,\u201d I growled, \u201cAnd what's to stop you from just leaving me hanging once you get out?\u201d\n\nThe little dude didn\u2019t say anything for a few minutes, contemplating his next move as I Googled like a madman. I was looking for blueprints for the college online since a place like this would have to have them filed. See, I\u2019m not super smart when it comes to math and science, but I know a little bit about building permits and filing your blueprints with the city. If this place was built by the college, then it had to exist in the public sphere.\n\nAfter an hour of looking with no results, I was ready to throw my phone down. I went and grabbed some kale chips out of the little fridge, munching them sullenly as I tried to come up with a plan. The little guy was back to looking at me again, and I couldn\u2019t help but notice that something had changed. All the eyes on his body opened and closed but they were never all open at once. He also looked tired, maybe even a little pale. I looked down at the bag of chips and thought again about how I might have to feed this little guy at some point.\n\n\u201cDo you need to eat? It\u2019s been about twenty-four hours since Doc was here, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been here when he feeds you.\u201d\n\nThe little creature pulled its lips up into a sad smile, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t feed me what I want. I don\u2019t eat normal food and you aren\u2019t equipped to give me what I need.\u201d\n\nI started to get a little offended, \u201cWhat's that supposed to mean?\u201d\n\nIt looked at me, and I felt a little shudder ripple over my skin as it did.\n\n\u201cI feed on brain waves. Creative brain waves, to be precise. The Doctor feeds me by just being around me like his lab assistants did. You, however, don\u2019t seem to create the same way he did. You look at your little device all the time and it makes your brain waves taste bland and unappetizing. That's why The Doctor\u2019s Assistants kept getting headaches. The more they created, the more I fed. The Doctor doesn\u2019t get them because his mind is like a wellspring. You, on the other hand, are incapable of nourishing me. You simply don\u2019t think the same.\u201d\n\nI sat back, not sure whether to be happy that I couldn\u2019t feed him or offended that he was sayin I was too dumb?\n\nIn the end, I guess I just decided to roll with it.\n\n\u201cWell, I guess we\u2019re both stuck then. You need to eat brainwaves and I need to eat food. We can\u2019t get either here, so what do we do about it?\u201d \n\n\u201cIs there anything in here we could use to break open the door?\u201d the creature asked hopefully.\n\n\u201cChecked already. There\u2019s some lab equipment and the fridge, the table you're on, and the chair I\u2019m sitting in. Other than that, not much. There are books, but none of them are gonna get us out of here.\u201d\n\nI kept searching on my phone for something that looked familiar in the blueprints, but it was getting frustrating.\n\n\u201cUgh, if only I knew where we were. If I knew the name of the building I could find the right map or tell security where to find us!\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, is that all you need to get us out of here?\u201d it asked, floating close to the side of the tank so it could look at me.\n\n\u201cWell yeah. If I knew where we were then I could tell security where we were stuck.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know where we are,\u201d it said, and it sounded less smug and more sinister when it said it.\n\nI stared back at it for a few seconds, waiting for it to fill me in.\n\nIt sat there for a few seconds, waiting for me to ask the question.\n\n\u201cWell? Are you gonna tell me or what?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should I?\u201d it said, \u201cIf I tell you, then you\u2019ll just leave and I\u2019ll be stuck here. What guarantee do I have that you won\u2019t just leave me once you\u2019ve gained your freedom.\u201d\n\nThe little son of a bitch had me there. There would be nothing to stop me from just leaving him here to die in that tank. Without any brain wave to gobble, he\u2019d shrivel up and die. Maybe that's what he deserved, but I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to hate him like that. The little dude had never done me wrong, and I couldn\u2019t mess up my karma by shafting him like that.\n\n\u201cI promise that if we get that door open, I\u2019ll take you with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd release me?\u201d he asked, hedging.\n\n\u201cDude, if you get us out of here, I\u2019ll take you to SeaWorld and release you, if that's what you want. The kale chips are going to run out soon, and if I starve, you are SOL little bud. You might not be able to eat my brain waves, but you can\u2019t open your tank or dial my cell phone with those baby fingers either. Whether we like it or not, we kinda need each other right now.\u201d\n\nThe creature nodded, bumping its little head against the side of the glass.\n\n\u201cAgreed. I will have to trust in your honor, I suppose.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrah, I am chocked full of honor. I've never welched on a promise and I\u2019m not gonna start now.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well then,\u201d it said with a little smile, \u201cThe building is called Rashley Laboratories. At least that's what the assistants always thought of when they thought about it at all. One of them thought it was spooky when they walked through it to get here, and the images led me to believe that it might be abandoned.\u201d\n\nI already had the cell phone out and Googling as he finished. There was no Rashley Laboratories, but there was an R. Ashley Science Hall. It had been abandoned in the nineties after an explosion in the science wing, but the campus had never torn it down for some reason. It had been named a historic building in two thousand nine and while they had renovated the outside to make it prettier, the inside was pretty much untouched.\nSounded like a great place for a secret lab and a covert experiment.\n\nCampus security picked up on the second ring, and I sighed when I realized it was the same guy I had dealt with the night before.\n\n\u201cCampus security, Officer Rob speaking, how may I help you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, yeah, we talked last night before you hung up on me. I still,\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, I remember you. Are you still playing this game? This has got to be getting old by now.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, just listen. We\u2019re\u2026I\u2019m stuck in the R. Ashley Science Hall and I need help.\u201d\n\nThere was silence as he digested this.\n\n\u201cOkay, nice try, but that building has been closed for years. I\u2019m pretty sure the doors never open. How exactly did you get in there, if you are actually stuck in there?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain,\u201d I said, looking at the little potato dude as I thought about how to start.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got time, let's hear the whole story,\u201d he said, pretending to be interested.\nTo hell with it, I decided, might as well lay it all on the line. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sitting down here with Doctor Crandler\u2019s experiment, the one who got arrested for buying stuff to make. He pays me to sit down here and watch it at night, but the door is locked and I need someone to let me out.\u201d\n\nThe line was quiet for a few seconds, and then Officer Rob started laughing.\n\n\u201cWow, great story. I love the little name drop, but I\u2019m kind of busy to be going down to an abandoned building and tromping through dust right now, why don\u2019t you call back when,\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d I said, deciding to take another direction, \u201cmaybe I\u2019ll just call the Feds and let them know that I have a highly illegal experiment that Doctor Crandler was working on and that the college was probably helping to fund. Then, when they ask why campus security didn\u2019t take the call, you can tell them how you thought it was a big joke and didn\u2019t look into it. That's probably going to make you look really great.\u201d\n\nThere was silence for a minute, then a big sigh from Rob.\n\n\u201cOkay, kid. It\u2019s at least worth a look, I guess. Give me your cell phone number so I can call you from my security phone when I get there. You can help me find you since you\u2019re so lost.\u201d\n\nI looked back at the potato dude, putting my hand over the phone as I whispered, \u201cGot any other ideas about how to find us?\u201d\n\nHe looked like he was thinking, before nodding and saying he could probably guide him to us.\n\nSo that's where we\u2019re at now. Help seems to be on the way, and I\u2019m updating you guys as I wait for the security dude to call back. I\u2019ll post again when I have an update so stay tuned for more news. Wish me luck, hopefully, we make it out of here pretty soon cause one more kale chip and I might need a barf bucket.",

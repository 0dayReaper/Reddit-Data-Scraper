    "postText": "\u201cHello! Welcome to Karuma Sushi!\u201d\n\nThe moment I walked in, I was greeted with a faint floral scent and the fresh scent of rice straw mats. The restaurant was small and cosy, decorated in a simple, minimalistic way that reminded you of a real Japanese home. In the middle of the restaurant was a chef station, with glass cabinets showcasing various fresh catches. An elderly Japanese chef in a clean, white uniform smiled and nodded at me, while a younger girl in a green apron led me to the wooden counter just in front of the chef station. The restaurant appeared to be family-run, the girl was no older than fifteen and so I guessed she was probably the chef\u2019s daughter helping out in her spare time.\n\nThere were no other customers besides myself. The restaurant was quiet, with no music playing. There was only a constant low hum of the air conditioner running in the background. Seeing how empty it was, I was a bit hesitant to sit down. I had never been a big fan of Japanese food growing up.\n\nBut for some reason, I really craved sushi tonight.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the first customer for tonight.\u201d The girl said excitedly as she laid down the dish and chopsticks in front of me. She seemed to be a bubbly, bright young girl full of energy. \u201cIn fact, you\u2019re the first customer at our humble restaurant! We just opened today. Oh! My mom would be ecstatic!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m just happy there\u2019s finally an authentic Japanese place around here.\u201d I looked around with curiousity. Although everything was clean, the furniture was not brand new. Judging from how worn-out the wooden chairs were, I would guess the restaurant was up and running for many years already, instead of literally opening tonight. \u201cI\u2019m excited already. Do you have any recommendations?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur restaurant is a little special, mister.\u201d The girl smiled. \u201cWe do omakase style dining. Have you ever heard of omakase?\u201d\n\n\u201cOma\u2026? What?\u201d\n\n\u201cOmakase,\u201d the girl repeated. \u201cIt means \u2018I will leave it to you\u2019, the chef will select and prepare the dishes based on the special or seasonal ingredients. At Karuma Sushi, we offer you a 20 dishes course. I guarantee that it will be a very fun experience for you!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo every dish is a surprise?\u201d I laughed, feeling adventurous. \u201cThis is great. I\u2019m very indecisive, so it\u2019s nice to have someone decide for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d The girl said, as the chef started to prepare the first dish. \u201cMy name is Kioku, and I will be telling you interesting stories for each and every dish we serve. That\u2019s the charm of omakase. We don\u2019t only sell sushi, but stories as well. My dad would be happy to tell the stories himself but his English is not very good, so please don\u2019t mind him.\u201d\n\nThe chef worked quickly and professionally. The first dish was a thinly sliced scallop sashimi served with a weird looking leaf and some brown sauce. Kioku seemed proud as she laid the dish in front of me. \u201cThis is hotate sashimi, served with homemade ponzu and fresh shiso leaf. Hotate are very delicate and sweet, this one was delivered straight from Hokkaido!\u201d\n\nThe scallop was indeed sweet and refreshing. Kioku continued to watch me in anticipation. It was a little awkward to have someone standing there, watching you eat. Kioku may have noticed this too, so when our eyes met briefly, she said in her usual, cheery voice, as if she was trying to break down the awkward silence.\n\n\u201cAnother fun fact about hotate: my mom craved hotate all the time when she was pregnant with me. Sometimes she craved it in the middle of the night, and my dad had to run to the supermarket to buy some frozen scallops and grill them for her.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds like a big effort from your dad.\u201d I glanced at the elderly chef.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the thing he did for love.\u201d\n\nKioku turned to her father, who nodded agreeingly. Although he didn\u2019t speak much English, it seemed he was still able to understand her.\n\nThe second dish looked a little scary and unappetizing. To be honest, it looked like spam being cut into thick round pieces. Kioku laughed as she set down the dish. \u201cMister, don\u2019t be fooled by how it looks! This is ankimo, steamed monkfish liver. Some say it\u2019s the foei gras of the sea.\u201d\n\nHer description didn\u2019t make it sound better. I tried a small bite, it was salty but also unexpectedly tasty. Kioku continued to blabber as I finished the plate. \u201cThe way you prepare ankimo is you first rub it with salt, then rinsed with sake. Speaking of sake, I\u2019ve never been drunk before. You know, I\u2019m still underaged and all. Have you been drunk before, mister?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d I looked up to her awkwardly as my mouth was full of food. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been drunk before.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder if you were as drunk as the guy that broke into our house that night.\u201d\n\nHer sudden calm delivery of that sentence almost made me choke. \u201cW-What did you just say just now?\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Kioku tilted her head. \u201cOh! Your tea almost ran out. Here, let me refill that for you.\u201d\n\nKioku took my ceramic tea cup and disappeared into the back kitchen. Confused, I looked at the chef, but the elderly man just briefly smiled at me before continuing to prepare the next dish. Rows of dead fish looking up to me with their empty eyes from behind the glass cabinet started to make me feel a little unsettled.\n\nKioku came back with my tea just as the chef finished preparing the third dish. The dish was the first familiar-looking sushi dish in the course, white fish on top, rice on the bottom. The fish were lightly burnt with a burn torch, and topped with thinly sliced scallion.\n\n\u201cMost people call this engawa nigiri, but actually engawa is not the name of the fish, but a fatty part near the tail where the meat comes from.\u201d Kioku explained. \u201cThis fish is called hirame, it\u2019s a type of flatfish. When they turn to their side, these ugly fish can hide in the sand pretty well, just like how that robber hid from my mom.\u201d\n\nI paused my eating. \u201cWhy\u2026 are you telling me this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you interesting tidbits about the dishes.\u201d Kioku giggled. Her manner didn\u2019t change, but it became clear she was not the innocent teenager I had assumed. \u201cThat robber was really drunk that night! He didn\u2019t even notice that my mom was there. He saw my dad leave for the supermarket and thought it was his chance to steal from our old, humble home.\u201d\n\nHer words sent shivers down my spine. I was frozen in place as Kioku continued her morbid story in a casual manner, as if she was talking about the weather.\n\n\u201cI bet he must have been really surprised to see my mom. But why should he be afraid of a small pregnant lady, right? Can you imagine what he did next?\u201d\n\nI heard a loud clang as the chef placed the next dish on the glass cabinet. He didn\u2019t say anything, just smiled at me. Kioku glanced at her father and laughed. \u201cAh! I was occupied by the story, the next dish is here. This is one of dad\u2019s signatures, and also a very popular dish.\u201d\n\nI shifted in my seat, considering the possibility of leaving this weird place.\n\n\u201cYou may be familiar with the red meat tuna they sell everywhere, that\u2019s called akami and it\u2019s the biggest part of the tuna. This part, however, is found only near the belly of the tuna. We call this part chutoro, look how pink and fatty it is.\u201d She took the dish from the glass cabinet and almost slammed it in front of me. \u201cBluefin tunas are pretty impressive, mister. They can dive deeper than 3,000 feet. Unlike my mom, she wasn\u2019t a very good swimmer. Although, I didn\u2019t think she would try to swim when she jumped off that cliff. Me being inside her belly must have also weighed her down pretty hard.\u201d\n\nLeaning down, Kioku whispered into my ear.\n\n\u201cI guess she didn\u2019t want to live after what you did to her.\u201d\n\nThe doorbell rang. Kioku jolted up in excitement.\n\n\u201cHi, mom. You\u2019re just in time!\u201d\n\nI tried to get up and turned around, but a pair of hands grabbed my shoulder and pushed, forcing me to sit back down. The hands were skin over bones, and I could feel the sharp nails digging into my shoulder through my shirt like animal\u2019s claws. Cold saltwater dripped down on my skin as her long wet hair tickled my cheek.\n\nI dared not turn and face her. All I could do was look up at Kioku in panic and fear.\n\nHow was that possible? The woman had killed herself fifteen years ago. Was this some kind of fucked up prank? Or perhaps a revenge by her vengeful family? But how did they even find me? I had been careful not to let a single soul know about what happened that night for all these years.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny.\u201d I tried to stand up again, but it was no use.\n\nIgnoring my protest, Kioku acted like nothing had happened. She proudly presented the next dish that her father had created. \u201cOh mister, you\u2019re gonna love this one. This madai sashimi is to die for. Did you know that Japanese people call madai the king of fish?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d Any struggle was futile at this point. Whatever was standing behind me, it was not letting me go.\n\n\u201cThe red sea bream is associated with good luck and is generally used in Japanese celebrations because of its beautiful vivid red colour\u2026\u201d\n\nI looked up in horror. The chef was still smiling, holding a sushi knife in his hand, while blood was gushing out from a deep slit on his throat. The blood dyed his white uniform red as it continued pouring down onto the chopping board. Kioku looked at her father, with a strange expression that I could only describe as amazement.\n\n\"What the fuck!?\" I screamed, trying to get away. As he bled out, the chef never stopped smiling. He just wiped down the counter with a rag and continued to slice blood-soaked fish with his trembling pale hands.\n\n\"Don't be so surprised, mister. After mom died, dad was really upset. The police brushed him off because he couldn't speak English well. Poor daddy, he resorted to ending his life.\" Kioku said. \"After all, what\u2019s the point in living without your wife and child?\"\n\nI had never felt so much fear before in my life. My entire body was shaking, and I felt like throwing up. The hands on my shoulder tightened their grip, and I could hear faint breathing next to my ears. \"W-Why are you doing this to me?\" I stammered.\n\nKioku sat down on the counter, casting her shadow over me as she leaned over and gently touched her mother\u2019s hand that was resting on my shoulder. As she smiled at me, I felt like her deep brown eyes were staring into my soul.\n\n\u201cIs that really something you have to ask?\u201d\n\n\"I-I\u2026\u201d I trailed off, unable to form coherent words.\n\n\u201cBet you thought you got away with it, huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease\u2026 I\u2019m really\u2026 sorry.\u201d I whispered.\n\nKioku giggled as she jumped down from the counter. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to force yourself to be sorry, mister, because you will have a long, long time to repent after this. Meanwhile, I\u2019ll personally make sure that you enjoy the remainder of our special omakase course. After all, you did say that you would leave it to us!\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, just\u2026 let me go.\u201d I pleaded, desperate for an escape.\n\n\u201cThe next dish is my favourite! And it will probably be yours too. Have you ever heard of uni? People call it sea urchin roe, but it\u2019s actually a sex organ! How fitting, right?\u201d Kioku laughed. \u201cI used to help dad prepare tons of them. It\u2019s actually very easy and satisfying, just crack it open and scoop it out.\u201d\n\nMy body wouldn\u2019t move. No matter how much my brain told me to run, there was no escape. And I could only wonder if Kioku\u2019s mother had felt the same way fifteen years ago.\n\nKioku smiled.\n\n\u201cSince you\u2019re our special customer, we\u2019d be happy to demonstrate how to cut open the uni for you. But I will need my special knife for this. Don\u2019t worry, mister. You won\u2019t have to wait for long! After all, our omakase course had just begun!\u201d\n\nShe disappeared into the back kitchen again. It had been fifteen minutes already, and I could hear her rummaging through the kitchen looking for the sharpest knife. I tried to plead with her father, saying how sorry I was and promising that if he let me go, I would turn myself in. But he wouldn\u2019t utter a single word. On the contrary, I started to hear a faint giggle from behind. Kioku\u2019s mother was enjoying the show. My torment would soon become her entertainment.\n\nI\u2019m typing this now as my last effort to warn all of you. I hope it can be sent through. If you ever pass the Karuma Sushi, never, ever go in. Although, if you happen to see it, it\u2019s probably too late for you already.\r  \n\r\r\n\n[And you know you deserve it anyway.](https://www.reddit.com/r/idontlikepapaya/comments/136ahik/welcome_to_ridontlikepapaya/)",

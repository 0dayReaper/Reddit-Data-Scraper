    "postText": "Yes, I can see people\u2019s auras. \n\nAnd I hate saying it so bluntly.  It makes me sound like some hack psychic who fakes the ability as a means of exploitation and a paycheck.  I\u2019ve never made money from my ability. I\u2019ve never taken advantage of it.  And, until now, I\u2019ve never spoken of it to anybody.\n\nBut I really do see them, and I\u2019m starting to view it as more of a curse.  I have a reason for typing this out and I assure you, there isn\u2019t a happy ending.   \n\nFor me, it\u2019s quite simple.  I see a faint light surrounding people.  Everyone.  And in that light, I can see their *morality*.  The brighter and more translucent the light is, the better the person.  The darker and opaquer, the worse.  Dim and partly translucent are morally ambiguous.   To simplify things, those are the three ways I describe them.  Dark equals evil.   Bright equals good.  Dim equals somewhere in between.  It\u2019s strange, I\u2019ve always viewed the people with grey/dim auras as\u2026 arbiters.  Mediators.  The people in between, who aren\u2019t one or the other, and will always have difficult decisions to make.\n\nI was a child when I first became aware of my gift.  It didn\u2019t take long to figure out that the brighter auras were kinder to me and selfless.  While both of my parents are good people, my father\u2019s aura was quite a bit brighter than my mothers.  As a result, he was always far more patient and understanding with me.   It was clear to see that my teachers and fellow students with brighter auras were usually friendlier and more compassionate.  The dark auras were the stereotypical fighters, lunch money stealers, and bullies.  I would say I was around 8 years old when I fully figured out that I have a gift that most people don\u2019t have.  That possibly *nobody* else has.\n\nI\u2019ve read some of the \u2018new age\u2019 websites and alternative medicine articles that give their take on aura reading.  While I believe that the vast majority of it is bullshit, I expect there must be at least SOME other people out there with my ability.  So I don\u2019t want to completely dismiss those people as an outright hoax.  It\u2019s just that, for me, it doesn\u2019t work anything like the way those websites describe.  I\u2019ve visited numerous aura readers and psychics.  Most of them have dim or dark auras themselves, and I\u2019m certain they don\u2019t really hold this power.  I\u2019m not saying all \u201cpsychics\u201d are terrible people.  I\u2019ve visited a few who had very bright auras.  They were unable to convince me that they really have psychic powers, but they at the very least used their deception to try and help people.  \n\nYou need to understand\u2026 I\u2019m going to end this entry by sharing a terrifying event that is happening to me.  But before I get to that, I think there are a few more things I need to explain.  I imagine many of you are curious as to what type of aura is the most common.  I\u2019m happy to tell you that the majority of people are somewhere between dim and bright.  I see very few dark auras.  This isn\u2019t scientific, and I haven\u2019t traveled the world plotting out charts and graphs, but I\u2019d estimate around 60% of people are bright-ish.  Around 25% dim-ish.  Leaving just around 15% dark-ish.  Again, these are just estimates.  What\u2019s the precise difference between, say, bright and dim?  I have no idea.  But rest assured, there is far more \u201cbright\u201d in the world than \u201cdark\u201d.\n\nThe next thing I\u2019d like to discuss is children.  I can see a person\u2019s aura right from birth, and I\u2019ve never encountered an aura changing as someone ages.  I\u2019m not sure what this means for the whole nature vs nurture debate.  And I\u2019m not saying that everyone with a dark aura always behaves terribly, or vice versa.  A person with a bright aura might be born in horrible conditions, acquire a drug problem, and then resort to thievery to feed their addiction.  I think the difference is this\u2026 a bright aura thief with a horrible upbringing may rob someone, but they would never intentionally hurt someone in the process.  A dark aura thief would kill someone if they could get away with it without even a second thought.  \n\nAnother interesting note\u2026  I find the ratio between bright/dim/dark to be similar across pretty much all human activities.  Whether I\u2019m at a church or a death metal concert, it always seems to be around that same 60%-25%-15% ratio.  I once visited a federal prison and was shocked to see that at least half of the prisoners had bright auras.  I had to be at the prison in person to see this because I can\u2019t see auras on photographs, television shows, movies, or even in mirrors.  I can only see auras in the real world.  Another strange thing\u2026 I can\u2019t even see my own aura.   I assume and hope I would be on the brighter spectrum\u2026 but I can\u2019t see it.\n\nThe brightest person I ever saw worked as a social worker.  She shone so bright that it was difficult for me to even look at her.  Based on the way people acted in her presence, I think that almost everyone around her could sense her brightness in a subconscious way.  Everyone loved her. She had donated a kidney to someone she barely even knew.  She had a special needs adopted child.  Most of the money she earned was donated to various charities.  And that\u2019s only the little that I knew of her.  This woman shined so brightly that she scared me.  It was scary that someone could be so good.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t nearly as scary as the darkest person I ever saw.  I was 20 years old at the time, leaving a club downtown at 2 am.  A man quietly walked down the street.  I didn\u2019t see him at first, but I noticed the light dimming around me.  This man was so dark that he partly absorbed the light around him.  I looked at him long and hard.  He looked desperate, cruel, and callous.  When he looked up and locked eyes with me, it made me fall back.  He smirked, as though he knew what I could see.  I saw his face up close.  I would never forget it.  And I recognized it when I saw his mugshot a few weeks later in the newspaper.  He had murdered his ex-wife and two children in cold blood.  \n\nI think I need to get to it now.  The reason why I\u2019m writing this out.  \n\nI fell in love a year ago.  She didn\u2019t shine anywhere near as bright as what I\u2019ve seen before, but she most assuredly wasn\u2019t dark or even dim.  She was beautiful.  Her sense of humor, her wit, her.. everything.  She was my dream woman.  And I\u2019ve never told her anything at all about the auras I see.  I could go into far more about her but this isn\u2019t a love story.  What\u2019s important is this:  We fell in love.  She got pregnant.  We got married.  We were happy.  We were *so* happy.\n\nI remember hearing the buzz of my phone two mornings ago.  I remember my excitement when I saw \u201cIt\u2019s happening.  Come to the hospital.\u201d  I remember my frustration when I got stuck in traffic.  I remember how long it took to find a parking spot.  I remember shouting at a nurse \u201cWHAT ROOM IS MY WIFE IN.\u201d  I remember bursting through a door and seeing the smile on my wife\u2019s face.  I remember seeing the doctor, his light shining so bright, as he told me \u201cCongratulations, it\u2019s a boy.\u201d\n\nThe doctor held him up to me.  \n\nAnd all the light in the room dissipated.  \n\n\u201cNo, this can\u2019t be.\u201d  I remember saying.    The doctor put him in my arms.  \n\nThe darkness around my son was so absolute that I could barely even see him.  He was a void.  He was so dark that the world barely even existed around him.  It was like nothing I\u2019d ever experienced.  I started weeping.  I think my wife and the doctor thought they were tears of joy.  But they weren\u2019t.  Lord knows they weren\u2019t.\n\nI think back to the dark outline around that man that murdered his family.  It was up to that point the darkest I\u2019d ever seen.  But the darkness around my son was 100 times worse.  A *thousand* times worse.  And what could possibly be a thousand times worse than murdering your entire family?\n\nIt\u2019s been two days.  We\u2019re home now.  My son\u2019s darkness is so extreme that it dims the hallway leading to his room.  My wife knows something is wrong.  I think she suspects I\u2019m having regrets about having children at all.  If only she knew\u2026\n\nWhat do I do?  He\u2019s my son.  Just 20 minutes ago I stood above him, holding a pillow over his face.  But I couldn\u2019t do it.  Not yet anyway.  A man who could murder his two-day old baby boy: what color would his aura be? \n\nAnd here\u2019s the thought that keeps going through my mind as I sit here alone.  The fathers of our worst.  The Adolf Hitler\u2019s.  Joseph Stalin\u2019s.  Timothy McVeigh\u2019s. If their fathers knew what they would become, would they murder them in the cradle?  Would they have the strength to hold down the pillow as long as it takes?\n\nI can see the door of my son\u2019s room from my office.  The hallway seems to be growing darker.  I look down at my hands as I type this.  Maybe I\u2019m going crazy, but there seems to be an aura around my hands and arms now.  It\u2019s gray.  It\u2019s dim.  Maybe it\u2019s always been dim.  \n\nI\u2019m looking down at the pillow beside me.    The grayish dim outline around my hands more apparent than ever. Maybe it\u2019s time.  Maybe this is why I have this gift.  It all comes down to right now.  \n\nMaybe it\u2019s time.\n\nI think it\u2019s time.\n",

            "comment": "Awhile back, I watched this show where this boy began to see these spiders on his family and friends.  No one else seemed to see them, but he could.  Then, when he took the spider off of his father and ate it, it seemed to make his father feel better.  So he started going around town and eating the spiders off of people's chests.\n\nIt wasn't until later that he realized that he wasn't eating their negative feelings.  He was eating their MEMORIES. And, while their memories didn't weigh on them anymore after he ate them, it led to them making the same mistakes and hurting themselves the same ways over and over again.\n\nYou may have figured out a working set of rules for your ability/gift, but the truth of the matter is that you have no idea if your working theory is true.  It's quite possible that maybe, you're seeing something else when you see \"auras.\"  Before you do anything drastic, I think it's important to do what you can to means test your ability and truly see exactly what it means.  After all, you haven't seen Hitler's aura, for example.  You have no idea what it would have been like.  It's important to know as much as you can before making drastic choices, especially when it comes to your son.  After all, what if it's like that boy and his spiders- the shininess you see could mean extroversion, or lack of depressive tendencies.\n\nBesides, I might argue that doing good things doesn't make you good, and being selfless doesn't make you a selfless soul.  And if a dark aura can do good and a light aura can do bad, then perhaps you too can find out the truth of your ability.",

Maybe you could see your own aura the whole time but you never noticed it until you thought of killing and that made your aura change to dim?\nIf your aura did in fact change then that means they can.\nIf you kept raising your kid it would be a while before a baby is actually capable of doing something harmful, so at the very least you would have time to see if his aura changes before he could do any harm to anyone. What if you killed him and your aura went to black. Then you would feel even worse. I wouldn't make any rash decisions that you can't take back. Just try your best to change his aura and actually see what his personality is as he grows. \nYou have his whole life to take him out if you are that worried but treating him badly won't make for a good kid either.

What I mean is that a sociopath will eventually learn to manipulate his own self to fit society, but before that happens, they give off red flags to those around them. They don't respond or react quite the right way, they respond with the wrong emotion when the correct one is pretty plain to everyone else, etc. You'll notice if your child isn't quite normal, and you'll *definitely* notice if your child is the bad kind of not normal. You'll notice it in time to get help and teach them the \"right\" way to feel and act. ",

That's just a thing people do that is societally accepted, and so it's weird when someone doesn't follow the mold. As mentioned several times in this thread, a lack of empathy can serve you well. Law school, management, and law enforcement are all things that can be helped by not letting the feelings of others stand in your way. You may not make many friends as a sociopath CEO or deputy, but you'll be wildly successful. \n\nEmpathy is innate and some don't have it, or have a hard time accessing it. But it isn't make or break. Most people have a bad association with the term \"sociopath,\" but those aren't the ones who go killing people Willy nilly. Psychopaths do that (and not even all of them.) Sociopathy is wicked interesting but it is certainly NOT a bad thing in and of itself. It's really more of a tendency toward apathetic logic rather than emotional processing, and god knows we need some more apathetic logic these days. ",

            "comment": "I am liking the idea, but I personally believe in personal morality. My morals are different than yours, and someone taking care of themselves doesn't necessarily denote  bad sense of morality. \n\nFrom what I gather you could say people who are less self concerned, giving/compassionate and putting others before themselves are \"brighter\". And someone who is self aware, logical and  concerned with their own health,welfare and wellbeing before the needs of someone else as \"darker\".\n\nMy problem with this logic is just because someone who takes care of themselves doesn't make them bad. Someone helping a random stranger out isn't necessarily \"good\". Because someone's personal experiences  make them more giving or reserved in certain situations. \n\nSo because say a child who had absent parents and had to take care of themselves and raise themselves and get a job and life on their own and be a self starter and go above and beyond what's expected of someone their age who might not empathize with someone failing out of school or on the streets begging for money. Because this person isn't willing to give a dollar to a homeless person or be patient with someone who can't hold down a job/pay rent...they're going to be darker? \n\nI want to be into the story but it's hard when there are qualities of people who are do gooders that I see to be bad. Like the \"selflessness\" of Christians I see to be selfish because they're still in quid pro quo mode...they're being quid \"a good person\" because pro quo \"worried about getting into heaven\" as being and that isn't necessarily the nicest reason to help someone. And is not by definition selfless or inherently good.\n\nSo I would enjoy the story more if \"bright\" and \"dark\" were defined not in a morality sense because in a sense you're applying an arguable interpretation of morality and ethics...which is cocky to assume your ethics could be determining the \"color\" you're vining or getting from them. \n\nBecause what if someone's own ethics determined how they navigate weather or not they are a good person? Is someone who is a meat eater who contributes to the slaughterhouse of American farming a good person because they're \"patient\" and they don't personally view their actions as bad? If They think They're good would that make them brighter? Then it's based on their own definitions of morality and ethics which would be a flawed system. And sociopaths could give off their own vibe...which is statistically 1 out of 25 people. ",

He lived a double life, basically--to everyone else, he was the ultimate Nice Guy, Devoted Husband, Ideal Employee, etc. I was stuck in the relationship because I was disabled and completely dependent on him. I knew no one would believe me until he did something he couldn't hide. That eventually did happen and I got out. The people who heard the truth were shocked.

That said OP did seem to briefly mention it:\n\n&gt;what color would his aura be?\n\nThat said I'm not sure if they just mean't brightness or dimness there.\n\nColor and size are the primary traits of someones aura, brightness and dimness do play are role by someone aura, but is by no means fixed. Someones aura color tends to indicate their personality. For example, nurses and doctors tend to have green or blueish-green aura. \n\nYour aura is something that's dynamic, it can change on your mood and status and change in general over time. In terms of brightness and dimness; while generally a bigger and brighter aura is better to have, it's not something that necessarily indicates good and bad (*again color is a factor in that*).\n\nSomeones aura can be brighter or dimmer depending on their mood or health. Someone who is sick, injured, or having a bad day will have a dimmer aura. Someone who is healthy and doing something they love will have a bigger and brighter aura. \n\nWhile it's probably more common for a *\"bad\"* person to have a dim aura, it's not really an indicator of that. A person is always sick or someone who is depressed would also have a dim aura, by no means does that make them a bad person. \n\n---\n\nWith that out of the way being able to see aura isn't all that special, and in fact it can even be improved upon and anyone can do it with enough practice. Of course some are naturally better, generally people tend to be able to see aura more often as children. It's not uncommon for this to lessen as an adult (*in my case I don't really see aura any more unfortunately, but I don't practice*).\n\nThat said, it's pretty common for people to mistake aura for [negative afterimages](https://www.verywell.com/what-is-an-afterimage-2795828) and think they see aura. Aura is something that you should not have to strain your eyes to see, it's also all encompassing on the shape of the person and moves with them. Negative afterimages are from straining your eyes on a bright color, unlike aura it based on where you where looking and stays in that spot. For example, the after image of a red circle will be blue and move with your field of vision, aura on the other had doesn't. They also look pretty different in general, but it's important to know the difference for someone starting out.\n\n---\n\nThat was significantly longer than the comment I was intending, although I hope you found that information helpful.",

I read it as the guy who killed his family did it because he saw them with a dark aura like the protagonist is with his kid, but infact the protagonist himself has a dark aura.\n\nBasically, the kid is perfectly normal, but the protag' has a dark aura and will kill his child. Like the man he saw did. It's basically him.\n\nAlthough that sounds like mental illness and I don't know if that would be a dark aura, as they are ill. Not just malicious.",

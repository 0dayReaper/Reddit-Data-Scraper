    "postText": "My name is Axel, as most of you know. The shop is closed permanently, which is good because all of my recent efforts have been focused on finding Selene. There have been signs and I am certain she still exists in this reality, but I am starting to wonder if I even want to find her. Because of everything that happened, she is really all that is left for me. She is the only one with answers.\n\nBut if none of that makes sense, go [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/z473tt/i_am_a_barista_that_serves_the_supernatural_find/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). You have some catching up to do.\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nWe left off with us prior baristas agreeing to follow Em and her father to the city they called home. A city called Fraeria. Usually the supernatural activity surrounding the Drowsy Spectre only occurred at night, so I was a bit confused when Em asked us to arrive in the parking lot during the day. At around 4pm we gathered outside the shop. I had expected Amber to be there for some reason, ready to impart some sort of cryptic wisdom in return for buying a candle. She wasn't there, though, and her car was absent too. Whatever Selene did with those marks seemed to have scared everyone and everything away.\n\nSilence demanded to come along. The black snake had to see Em's father, she had closure to achieve and I think a bit of revenge perhaps. There wasn't much a small reptile like her could do, especially since she'd been turned into a non-venomous species. That wasn't for me to question. Silence had been a snake so long that she couldn't even remember who she was before; who was I to refuse her the possibility of some answers?\n\nAnyway, we were in the parking lot. Em's father refused to give us his actual name, so we came to know him as Guide. It seems creatures of his kind prefer titles that describe their purpose, not the names given at their creation or birth. We didn't speak much before Guide led us into the forest surrounding the cafe, but it was a very long walk ahead and eventually Barrow approached me.\n\n\"Did you bring the doll?\"\n\nI didn't see a reason to be dishonest. \"It is gone.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That wish you had me make? It caused this.\" I showed him my wrist. \"My wish to end it burned the doll to a crisp.\"\n\n\"Interesting.\" He then fell behind a bit, lost in thought.\n\nWe stopped to eat at some point when it got dark. Seeing as one of the main rules of the cafe was to not be outside at night, I was a bit nervous. Nomic ended up tagging along, enticed by the healing of his mind. Guide did not promise anything, but he certainly did suggest that it was possible in the magical city he was leading us to. Our party included Em, Barrow, Nomic, myself, and Guide.\n\n\"We cannot stop for long.\" Guide stated after summoning a fire with the clap of his hands. \"Even my power will not protect you from everything this strange forest harbors.\"\n\n\"So it is even strange to you?\" Barrow asked.\n\nGuide laughed. \"I may wander it, but that does not mean I have a clue what it is. My people are not of this world, but can be brought here through this forest. Where I am from, we are called Elwae. It is your people that have given us strange titles from your children's tales.\"\n\n\"Wait, so Em is not a pixie?\" I asked.\n\n\"You decide what is in a name. She is to you whatever you call her. A flower, or a stone.\" He eyed the darkening forest. \"I am curious; what has become of your giant?\"\n\n\"We have not seen him since the teeth got him.\" Em answered.\n\nI recalled Tall Ben asking for help. Maybe if I would have accepted, he would be here to assist us in this time of trouble. \"Maybe they ate him up. The tooth plague killed Heartmin. Might've taken longer, but I don't see why it couldn't chew him up too.\"\n\n\"I thought he was more resilient. The giant would have been a proper ally in darker hours yet to come.\"\n\nOminous. \"What do you mean by that?\"\n\nHe chose not to answer. Instead, he produced some fish from his bag. He passed it to Em, who then placed it over the fire. \"There is food if you are hungry.\"\n\n\"No strings?\"\n\nEm looked at Barrow. \"Why do you think he gave it to me first?\"\n\nHe accepted this before taking one of her wooden plates.\n\nI was not satisfied with the lack of answer. \"Guide, what did you mean by that?\"\n\n\"There are birthing pains here. Something draws near and this issue of ours is merely a symptom.\" He grinned. \"It would have been much easier for you if you would have let me turn you into some rodent, yeah? I little bird, perhaps.\" That's what Selene called me. How did he know that? \"Do you still have that one little trouble maker? The snake, that is. Oh, and that lizard too. I do hope they've adjusted well.\"\n\n\"They are free now.\"\n\n\"Are they? I've watched closely. So far I've not seen them leave your apartment. I could change them back, you know, for a price.\"\n\nHe wanted a deal. \"I'm not playing this game!\"\n\nA hand rested on my knee. \"You okay man?\" It was Nomic; he looked concerned. \"Your face is all red.\"\n\nIt was then I realized that no one else had commented on our conversation, or even taken notice. Had it been in my head? Guide gave me a knowing smirk and invaded my thoughts once again. \"Just between us. Think on it.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm fine. Just tired.\" I lied to Nomic. Em's father would be trouble, it seemed. That wasn't much of a surprise.\n\nA little voice tickled my ear. \"Kill him.\" I couldn't answer discretely enough to not be noticed. Silence spoke once more with a long hiss. \"Hurt him.\"\n\nI gently place a hand on my shoulder, comforting the snake underneath my coat. It was still cold around my neck of the woods and Silence always got... irritated at such temperatures. This area shouldn't have been that cold, though, but I could only blame that on the unnatural forest we found ourselves in. As night grew later, it only got worse. The fire was going strong, despite its unnatural creation. There was no time to sleep, it seemed, as after only roughly two hours of sitting Guide demanded we all prepare to move again. To my comfort, the forest was not silent. Crickets chirped despite the cold weather and even bats could be heard squeaking overhead. Other than the company, everything seemed completely normal about the forest that surrounded the cafe. I assumed this was because we entered it during the day and not when the sun set but, if that was the case, then how could it possibly lead us to this supernatural civilization that Guide and Em were from?\n\nThose questions were answered when we saw the first teeth. They were stuck in a tree that bled sap. At our approach, the teeth wiggled but could not make the tree move towards us. I feared that because they were there, that may mean that the rest of our troublesome neighbors might also make an appearance.\n\n\"Is she a friend?\" A little voice whispered to me along the way. Silence slithered closer to my ear. \"The spider-woman?\"\n\nI glanced behind us and saw a face in the trees. It was a familiar one and, for anyone other than me, might deceive a lonely man into becoming a meal. I had already fallen to her whims once, but this was not the same. Her eyes gazed with fear at our guide, Em's father, and she beckoned me closer. I fell discretely to the back of the line, just near enough for her to climb overhead. Ramata was her name, as some of you might remember.\n\nI saw her full glory. The head and torso of a woman, but with many legs sprouting from under her shoulders. There were far more than eight, as a normal spider would have, instead boasting more than a dozen. They each ended with black hands full of sharp nails. She moved with complete silence, not even disturbing Guide. If I did not trust her intentions due to our prior history, I would have fled into the dark full of the most potent terror.\n\nShe came lower, just barely in the aura of our flashlights. I was happy to see that the teeth had not infected her. Yet, at least. A few steps behind Nomic, I fell behind as far as I felt comfortable.\n\n\"I assume you will hold true to your word?\"\n\n\"I will. We are friends, my love.\" She whispered. Her voice was the wind, so slight and discrete; just for me. \"You saved my children.\"\n\nNone of the others had noticed, but I kept my voice as low as I could regardless. \"Then why are you stalking us?\"\n\n\"That man's people come from a different world, one who shall bring forth a being that shall determine the fate of all things. My web stretches to many places, dear one. I have heard many things from those that wander into my traps.\" She waited, expecting me to have something to say. I didn't. \"But there is tell that a human shall write about such things and influence the destiny of that world with mere words.\"\n\n\"You came here only to tell me that?\"\n\nI didn't intend to offend her, but she was far too cryptic for any use. \"Destiny doesn't mean peace, young love. It is destined that all things will one day die. It may be in your power to halt this being from gaining the might to direct fate. Do not speak to the voice in the light, do not speak with the devil that is called Elidian.\"\n\n\"I am pretty tired of speaking with devils. It seems I've made deals with far too many.\"\n\n\"But this one will not come to strike a deal. Your heart; he will play it like a stringed instrument, and you will be inspired as any writer is. Do not listen.\" Her all too human eyes flickered towards Em's father. \"And do not be mistaken; your guide has no intention of letting you return home.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nSuddenly she went silent, her face vanishing into the darkness. Ramata came bringing only questions, ones that I could not bring to anyone in our company. I did not trust Barrow anymore and could hardly trust Em with her father around. Nomic wouldn't have anything valuable to say considering he didn't even know who he was. That left Silence, who had decided to live up to her name and not answer anything I sent her way.\n\nThe insects had gone quiet. That was when I registered that Ramata wasn't being cryptic in her departure;\n\nShe had fled.\n\nEm's father must have caught on as well, because he halted the journey. \"Don't make a sound.\"\n\nHe did not turn off the flashlight, so I assumed it was safe to scan the trees. There sounded like a strong breeze to my left, approaching from the distance. But... the trees were swaying. I could hear leaves being picked up and thrashed about by the gust.\n\nThen we all saw it. White dots crawling along the floor, carried on the backs of a living horde. Insects, rodents; an amalgamation of predators and prey driven on by their parasites. I grabbed Em, who was nearest, in a desperate bid to survive. These things hunted by sound and touch; we had once chance. I took my coat, wrapped it around her, and covered her completely. There was a nearby tree just wide enough for us to hide behind and I had only seconds to reach it.\n\nThat sound still echoes in my mind. Not one of the animals cried out, not one. But they got closer and I could hear tiny footsteps on the ground, I could feel the ground tremble with the sheer number of legs that the stampede boasted.\n\nI thanked whatever god was listening that I wore gloves that day, because my hand was still out when the plague struck. It was a sparrow that smacked into it, slamming into the ground. The creature was surely crushed underneath the combined might of the horde. I could feel thousands of tiny legs crawl all over me and could only pray that they did not approach my exposed face.\n\nEm was covered, I was not.\n\nSomething landed on me, something rather large but with many legs. It was not swept away immediately.\n\nIt crawled and clicked as it searched out flesh it surely sensed. Was it my breathing, was it my own trembling teeth?\n\nYou know how you can anticipate touch? Feel it before it happens? I knew it was going to reach me. I was going to die. I felt the tickle, the tiny sensation of an insect gripping onto a tiny pore. When it did, I felt something try to bite down on the bit of my exposed neck.\n\nWith only one option, I took a risk and grabbed the insect before the teeth on it could multiply using my own flesh. I saw a massive centipede covered in wiggled teeth from all manner of creatures. When I dropped it, it vanished into the sea of infected forest life. It seemed the hive mind was loose because none of them came for me.\n\nAnd then it was over. We stayed in place to let those that fell behind catch up. Once the horde of teeth and meat was gone, I quickly checked my own neck. Em, sensing safety, assisted me and I nearly cheered when she swore I had no teeth on my neck. A tiny little red mark, a gentle cut, was the only evidence I had been bitten. Was that enough? Was I infected? Even now, I do not know.\n\nNomic and Em's father had the wisdom to cover up and hide. I was relieved to see that, regardless of how impossible it seemed, we had all escaped the tooth plague without infection. A minute or two after, the sounds of the natural forest returned.\n\n\"We need to move.\" Em's father was the first to break the silence. \"No more speaking until I say.\"\n\nEventually we stopped to rest. This time, Guide told us that sleeping for a few hours would be possible. \"We have crossed the threshold into the realm of the Elwae. Sleep easy tonight.\"\n\nBut I was the last to fall asleep. That was thanks to his constant gaze that never wavered from my face. Eventually I heard his voice once more, his mouth moved, but no one stirred. \"You brought one of them with you, I see. The quiet snake. If I am honest, I do not even remember her name.\" He laughed at the fate he delivered to her. \"Keep her. I am very curious to see what she plans to accomplish.\"\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nOur journey from then on was uneventful. We got maybe four or five hours of sleep, which was surprisingly not interrupted. I don't know if Barrow sleeps, though. I was the first one to wake up and even found that Em's father had fallen asleep. Barrow, however, arrived before the others woke up. He had been in the woods relieving himself. He had been gone for quite a while though.\n\nDuring the early morning hours the woods were quite peaceful and pleasant to traverse. I did notice the occasional rodent with white marks on its body, sick with the plague that I somehow unleashed. There were some on the plants as well and, despite Guide's confidence that they were completely safe, he gave the plagued portions of the woods a wide pass.\n\nBut then we came to a treeline. It was the end of the haunted woods that separated the cafe from the many strange worlds beyond. A rolling field separated us from a city that was surprisingly modern. Skyscrapers of foreign design rose high into the sky. There were streets below with regular traffic, but everything was designed with a certain lack of color. Every structure was metallic or concrete. The City Fraeria was not the nature-haven I expected. I thought of elves from Lord of the Rings, or Fae Forests with entire kingdoms being carved from the wood of ancient trees. Instead Em's people lived in a place not entirely different from us, but with far more of a sleek taste. The buildings were very... sharp. Human skyscrapers are usually built with an antenna of some kind on top. Instead these seemed like knives meant to not just scrape the sky, but cut them open with surgical precision.\n\n\"That is not what I expected.\" Nomic confessed. \"Why is there an entire metropolis in the middle of the woods?\"\n\n\"It was all a forest once.\" Guide replied. \"All of your cities. We only had the heart not to destroy the rest.\" He certainly wasn't wrong. \"Come. We seek an audience with the Eilin Hae. Only with his permission can we go to the fountain of life. This is his city, we are his people, and it is that light that powers this place. He will need convincing.\"\n\nGuide looked at me. \"I don't have anything for him. He's your leader, that is up to you.\"\n\n\"I think you will be surprised, Mr. White. Eilin Hae finds worth deep in the soul. Come; every second wasted is a risk I am not willing to take.\"\n\nWe crossed the fields of fine grass, passing into a realm that wasn't quite the same as the one we had come from. It was like a mirror but with small mistakes in the design. The broken stripes on the road were yellow instead of white, the green traffic lights were purple instead for no particular reason. There were shops along the sidewalks and people that looked as human as myself went about their business. Everyone was generally taller, however, which made me quite confused as to why Em was so small. She took giant potions, after all, to make herself capable of blending in with humans.\n\nThat was a sensitive question to ask, however, and I wasn't going to be the one to voice it despite my curiosities. We were ticking bombs, capable of dying if the ritual that we were marked for was attempted again.\n\n\"We are missing someone.\" Em's father announced, halting the journey.\n\nIt was only then that any of us noticed Barrow's absence. I had been walking in the back and hadn't even noticed his departure. \"Could he have been... snatched?\"\n\n\"No. That is not how things are done here.\" Our guide scanned the nearby alleys. \"Where has he gone? Tell me now.\" Seeing as, so far as I know, none of us had any idea, his demand was met with silence. \"This is not a place for a human to wander. No matter, he will turn up if he wishes to ever make it home. Only the Elwae can find this place, and only an Elwae can navigate our side of the forest.\"\n\nOur journey continued, but I approached Em. \"Where did he go?\"\n\nShe was his closest friend, but even she was unaware. \"This place really isn't safe. It is hardly the place for him to wander off on his own.\"\n\n\"Will he be fine?\"\n\n\"He better be. We don't have time to go looking for him, but...\" She glanced at her father. \"Maybe we should? We must see the Eilin Hae in his tower. I told Barrow about that and while he might not know his way around the city, the tower can't be missed.\"\n\nEm sounded like she was trying to convince herself. I didn't like it, especially considering the fact that my burned wrist was thanks to Barrow's wish. He was up to something and my ability to trust him was waning. But, if I am honest, at the moment my mind was greatly preoccupied with the strange city and had no room to worry about Barrow's antics.\n\nThere was a massive building near the center of the city. It rose as high into the sky as the others, even taller than those around it, but the length and width were impressive too. This dwarfed even the greatest of our structures and it seemed to be our destination. Guide led us up the steps towards the front door and was stopped by professionally dressed security personnel. Again, this place was not very different from our own world.\n\nAfter a short, hushed discussion, we were granted entry. We were each given a green wristband, very similar to the pink ones given to guests at hospitals, and ferried inside. The sideways glances we received within were far sharper than I had seen outside. We were not welcome in the city, but much less in the heart of their home, whatever \"they\" were. I counted myself lucky to discover that they had elevators. Of course, that seems obvious to assume, but we had walked all the way to the building instead of driving. That took a while and made me nervous seeing as Em's father didn't seem to have a limit to his endurance. Guide pressed the top button of the elevator and so began our long ascent to the highest floor.\n\nThe design was the same even inside the building, right down to the interior of the elevator. Dark metal, trimmed occasionally with wood. It wasn't iron, obviously, otherwise Em's father would be in incredible pain. There wasn't a single scratch on any of the polished metal; it was like a dark mirror wherever I looked.\n\nThe lights shined with a hint of emerald green, as if to mimic the natural sheen trees made when the sun poured from their canopy. Finally the elevator doors opened into a short hallway. That hall had double doors that a well-dressed man opened at our approach. We had to show our wristbands, let the barcode be scanned, and only when each of us passed were we able to enter.\n\nWhat we found inside was not meant for human eyes.\n\nHave you ever driven up to a crossroads and stopped, but when you stare ahead it seems like everything is sort of... zooming out? Or sometimes in, I guess. Within the room was what amounted to a portal of sorts. I could circle the center of the room as much as I wanted, but if I got closer it just... kept going. I barely made a dent in the distance that separates me from the brilliant green eye that watched us. It was celestial in size, my mind knew that, dwarfing even our own planet. But how could that fit in a room?\n\nThis being was nearly identical to the terrible Eye of Gold and Crimson that I had spoken with all those months ago. It was garbed in a storm that could not be measured, arcs of emerald lightning flashed but seemed as tiny things from such a distance. But it did not speak with the mouths of discarded flesh like the Eye of Gold. Instead, there was a woman sitting between us and the nigh-infinite walk to the eye. She got up from the floor and turned to greet us.\n\n\"I am The Eilin Hae.\" She said.\n\nOr he, I guess? They had all referred to The Eilin Hae as a man. Being in the presence of what amounted to a god did not have the effect one may have expected. She was... a person. In appearance, that is. I anticipated a powerful voice, one that would inspire me to bend a knee and hide my face. But, as far as intimidation, I felt as if I was meeting the CEO of some business.\n\n\"My lady.\" Our guide bowed. We followed suit, but the pronoun he used further confused me. \"A forbidden ritual has latched itself onto my daughter and these common people with me. We ask to visit the Infinite Sight.\"\n\nWhen she stepped forward, she was no longer drowned by the green eye's countenance. It was only then that I saw her eyes burned with a similar light. When she spoke, that same glow was escaping from the depths of her throat, as if some great emerald fire burned at her core. That fixed my mind's mistake in relating her to a person. Those eyes... I felt like staring into them would burn mine out, blind me like the sun itself. But blind more than just my vision, blind my spirit and will entirely.\n\n\"Even if I accepted, your daughter is not human. Who is to say if the Infinite Sight has seen her? It belongs to wyr only.\"\n\n\"Even we were once wyr, my lady, were we not?\"\n\nShe considered this. \"An interesting thought. What reason would I allow this? What will you offer me in return?\" The Eilin Hae's gaze abandoned Guide and fell to Nomic. \"What can a lost man offer when he doesn't know his own name?\" Then Em. \"Or a girl who has no people?\"\n\nThen finally, she looked upon me. \"But this is interesting.\" Then she came closer. She wore long robes of dark gray. Stitches of deep green made patterns all over her garb, an outfit of a deeply religious zealot. Every step seemed sacred, with the potential to bring any of us to our end. I did not know the meaning of the title \"god\" until I faced that gaze. But it was not hers, it belonged instead to the endless power that spoke through her.\n\n\"One that doesn't know his name, one that doesn't know her people, and one that I do not know. What sort of company have you brought me, Eruli?\" I didn't remember falling to my knees, but there I was. She knelt to meet my gaze. \"You know things, things you shouldn't know. There are machines that rely on the tiniest piece to run at all. If that tiny piece is removed, it falls apart.\"\n\nHer hands were warm, she took mine and held them. \"You have seen the abomination? The Eye of Two Colors?\" I nodded, my tongue tied up in my mouth. \"There is one that shall bear that golden gaze but, unlike my emerald eyes, that power will be at their command. I am simply the devout of the Eye of the Wilds.\"\n\n\"What do you want?\" I finally asked.\n\nShe smiled. \"That you keep your word. Write.\"\n\nFor reasons I still don't know, I found myself crying. Write? Write?! I keep being told to do that, and I am writing, but I know they weren't talking about this series of updates. There was something more and no one wanted to give me answers. \"You... you aren't the first to ask. Write what?\"\n\n\"You will know very soon. The Infinite Sight will allow you to see.\" She stood. \"He is permitted to go. The others have nothing worth offering, so they may leave.\"\n\nThat wasn't enough of an answer for me. Waiting was done; I came here to fix my arm and find answers, to start my search for Selene. Cryptic instructions would not do. But Em's Father, who the Eilin Hae had called Eruli, clenched his fist. He barely held himself back, struggling to remain on his knees. \"But... but my daughter will-\"\n\n\"We all go, or I won't.\" I bargained my own importance. I could choose not to write whatever it was they found so important. \"I won't go to the light.\"\n\nEilin Hae stared at me for a time before she finally spoke. \"What is most curious about you, Axel White, is that you deem yourself a Fatewriter of more than just the story alloted to you. How is it your right to judge the fate of these with you?\"\n\n\"How is it yours?\"\n\n\"A wise answer. This is your bargain, I will accept.\"\n\nRamata had warned me not to listen to the devil that would come for me. She hadn't begged anything of me, however, so I accepted the deal. \"Then I will go, but they will come with me.\"\n\nShe nodded and her eyes began to burn with further brilliance. The green wristbands we wore glowed in response. \"And there is evidence of my permission. You may-\"\n\nSuddenly we were all knocked to the ground, the entire building shook as if it caught in a whirlwind. Even the Eilin Hae fell, striking the hardwood floor with a thud. She quickly recovered. \"You brought it here!\"\n\nBefore we could ask her what, the top of the building was peeled away. There were cloudy, gray skies on the horizon but above us was a black abyss. Deep in that darkness was a golden gaze, wreathed in a terrible storm, burning with a crimson glow. The Eye of Gold and Crimson had arrived.\n\n\"Leave!\" Eilin Hae roared.\n\nFlesh fell in squishing lumps. It looked like... chicken, blended with bloody ground beef. In mere seconds those clumps shaped themselves into poor imitations of living creatures. Those limbs were meant to be legs, but they barely supported the misshapen figure that tried to balance on them. More formed. Some had giant mouths, much like I had seen before, and others eyes or ears. There were no speeches this time, though. Instead the mouths simply babbled nonsense as they charged. We had only seconds to process this before the first abomination got its limbs around a nearby security personnel. The wad of flesh ripped off pieces of the Elwae with ease and, by merely touching the detached flesh, turned it into a mush that it threw to the side.\n\nIt took only moments to reduce him to a lump of flesh, only a gurgled cry later and he was gone.\n\nEm's father grabbed my arm firmly, revealing that I was the only one stuck in place. So mesmerizing was the impossible sight that I had forgotten about my own life, which was clearly in peril. Even without the minions of the Eye of Gold, I would die. The building was coming down!\n\nAgainst all my instincts, I followed Em's father and the others into a deathbox that was the elevator. It was the only way down, aside from jumping. Every time it shook, I was certain we were dead. Every shutter brought a prayer to my lips, but I didn't know what I was even praying to. Something listened, however, as the doors finally opened to a chaotic ground floor.\n\nThe front doors were shattered and there was no longer any security at the door. The city was full of screams. Cars were wrecked all along the full streets and fires burned everywhere.\n\nOver the chaos, Em's father took charge. \"Leave! We leave the city!\" He put his hands in front of him and grasped at air, then pulled the empty space in front of him apart. As if tearing the fabric of reality, he ripped open a hole in the air. A boom, like thunder exploding just overhead, nearly burst my eardrums. Nomic and I were knocked to the ground, but Em seemed more ready.\n\nI couldn't hear anymore, but I could see that Em was fighting her father. All my ears could do was ring. He grabbed her by the collar, ignored her scratching and fighting, and threw her into the hole. She went flying and I lost sight of her. Em's father then dragged me to my feet and I was shoved inside, followed by Nomic.\n\nJust as my hearing was coming back, the hole slammed in on itself and shattered my senses once more. But when I came to, I realized that Em's father had not come along. We were back in the woods, who knows how far away from the city, and we no longer had our guide. Em screamed at the air.\n\nMy hearing was coming back again. \"What... what happened?\"\n\n\"He's still there.\" Em began to cry. \"He is still in the city. You can't use your own portal... there isn't a way for him to follow.\"\n\n\"We don't have Barrow either.\" Nomic rubbed his ears hard. \"We have to go back.\"\n\n\"How? I can't open portals.\"\n\n\"Portals? I didn't even know portals existed until today! You know more than the rest of us. If you can't do that... then we walk. That is how we got there, after all.\" I answered.\n\nShe shook her head. \"Only pixies know the way.\"\n\nThis mission was about more than saving myself. I needed to find Selene and that meant I needed to be alive. \"Your father himself said y'all aren't pixies. He called himself an Elwae. You aren't a pixie and you aren't a human, you are an Elwae like the rest of them. You can do this. Take us back.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I don't care how!\" I snapped. I know, bad timing, but is there a good time to break? \"Do something, quit asking for guidance! We. Don't. Know! Barrow is still there and we are still marked! I only have more questions, no answers!\" We still had our wristbands. \"This is our key. We go back and you'll lead us to the light under the city.\"\n\n\"I don't know if I can.\" Lifted her hands, her fear driving her defensive stance. \"I've never gone to the city on my own.\"\n\n\"Did you take any potions with you?\"\n\nEm's eyes widened slightly. That was answer enough. \"No more pretending. You can't hang inbetween, you'll take your true form. Like your father said, you are not a pixie.\"\n\n\"Then why am I small?!\" She screamed, hands in her hair. \"Why aren't I like anyone else?!\"\n\n\"I DON'T KNOW! You are part Elwae, so start walking!\" I looked to Nomic, who was still rubbing his ears. It was only then that I realized my own aggression. Taking a deep breath usually helps; it did not fail me. \"Look, we don't have a choice. If you can't take us there, you can't take us home either. Just... just start walking. That is a good place to begin.\"\n\nShe didn't seem to like it, but there wasn't anything else to try. Em led us into the forest in a random direction. We had only two hopes; that her blood would lead her, or that luck would be on our side.\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nThere is far more to tell, obviously, but that seems like a good stopping point. Kinda shitty, I know, but you'll get the rest in time. I've got a plane to catch; there was a 4chan post about a strange blue mark on some guy's wrist. Could be nothing, but I managed to set up a meeting. Writing time is up and I'll be back in a few days. This could be the one, guys.\n\nSorry to keep everyone waiting this long. When I am finished writing, you'll understand. Until then, be safe. There is a terrible eye on us all.",

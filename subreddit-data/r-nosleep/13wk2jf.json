    "postText": "\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get one thing straight: I don\u2019t believe in ghosts, I don\u2019t believe in the Easter bunny, and I sure as *hell* don\u2019t believe in any wooden people.\u201d\n\nAt the murky forest\u2019s outer edge, Tom McCann cleared his throat. He waited until me and Dad stopped and faced him head on, then added, \u201cBut I\u2019ve got a crew sitting with their thumbs stuck *firmly* up their arses because there\u2019s fairytale monsters running around out here, so I\u2019m stuck playing your stupid game. Congratulations.\u201d\n\nMy father said, \u201cMr. McCann, I know you think I'm crazy, or a conman, or probably both. But I'm telling you this one final time, it\u2019s not too late to take a bath on whatever money you might lose and find another project.\u201d\n\nOur employer was a muscular man with an even tan, dressed in a tracksuit and white trainers. He wore a large Rolex, which caught the moonlight every time he scratched his thick, utility pole neck. \u201cAre you about done?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. You wanna get paid tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would sure be nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen shut the hell up and do what I hired you to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d my father replied. He grabbed two flashlights from his pack and tossed one in my direction.\n\nI caught it, a lump already rising in my throat. A maze of warped, crooked trees lay before us, their skeletal boughs thrust together like sweeping arms. I\u2019d never even seen a wooden person before\u2014I didn\u2019t yet know whether I\u2019d have the courage to face one down. My greatest fear, back then, was disappointing my old man.\n\nDad guided us along where spaces occurred naturally until, a dozen or so paces into the forest, the foliage thinned out.\n\nOver his shoulder, he said, \u201cSo tell me Mr. McCann, isn\u2019t Redburn a national heritage site? I\u2019m surprised you got permission to bulldoze the place.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that how you\u2019re gonna fix this problem? Show these tree people I\u2019ve got the right paperwork?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just curious. You\u2019re not the first visitor who tried buying up land for cheap.\u201d\n\nOur employer rolled his eyes. \u201cWell, Patrick, the simple fact is this new development is gonna be the magnet that attracts opportunity. The suits are scared of eco-warriors who cry on Facebook, sure, but they also know everything I touch turns to gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t the wildlife trust try to stop you?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Course they did. Luckily, I don\u2019t believe in no\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh, that\u2019s funny. I could have sworn the judge said \u2018no\u2019 to your appeal about the recovery order. You had to hand over, what was it, 19 apartments?\u201d\n\n\u201cThose fraud charges were about as legitimate as your little wooden friends,\u201d Tom hissed, his voice bitter.\n\nUpset this outsider was belittling our beliefs, I clenched my jaw, tight. Dad, however, just chuckled. The sceptic couldn't rile him up\u2014not my father, unshakeable as an oak tree, tall and rangy with a shock of greying hair and a long, straight nose, same as mine. He said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe this crap, why come begging me for help?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo things. One, I came *asking* for help. And two, I\u2019m no mug. I\u2019ve seen this scam before. You locals make up fairy tales and scream cultural heritage\u2014\u201d air quotes accompanied those words\u2014\"to extort the evil entrepreneur from the big city. Well, fair warning, if I don\u2019t see some supernatural shit tonight, you aren\u2019t getting a single cent from me. Sound reasonable?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure does. Fair warning though, I\u2019d strongly advise not letting any wooden person touch you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh gee, I\u2019ll try.\u201d Mr. McCann looked down his nose at me. \u201cRonan, was it? What age are you Ronan?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m twelve,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cTwelve, huh? And is that old enough to come ghost hunting?\u201d\n\n\u201cRonan can take care of himself,\u201d Dad answered. My face flushed with pleasure at the compliment. \u201cBesides, theres\u2019s things he needs to learn.\u201d\n\nThe trail twisted three times, carrying us through marshy grass, alongside a narrow stream, deeper and deeper into the gloom. From out amongst the endless darkness, I could hear the crunch of dead leaves, the snap of rotten wood.\n\nAbove the canopy, where we could see it, the moon drifted in and out from behind thick, billowing clouds. And my electrified nerves jumped at every cry of a tiny animal, barely audible beneath the trees whispering in the breeze.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d Mr. McCann said, after a minute of silence.\n\n\u201cWell what?\u201d Dad asked.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this the part where you tell me about the tree pixies?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t believe in this stuff?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t. But I\u2019m not having the crew rock up tomorrow and say you didn\u2019t do the right magic tap dance to cleanse the evil spirits.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you know about them already?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know they\u2019re keeping me from stream rolling this shithole.\u201d\n\nDad ducked beneath a bough. \u201cIs that all?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey kill children who wander through the forest late at night, blah blah blah. It\u2019s your boilerplate urban\u2014\u201d\n\nBefore the baron could finish a mouse scurried out from beneath a downed log. He yelped, hopping from one foot to the other, a little foxtrot, and got to work trying to stomp the little critter, who moved way too fast.\n\nWithout looking back, Dad said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve seen braver men than you jump out of their skin out here.\u201d\n\nDespite the pent-up anxiety, I chuckled. My father was enjoying this. A lot.\n\nMr. McCann muttered something too low to hear.\n\n\u201cWell, the kid things partly true,\u201d Dad said on the far side of a nestle of ferns. \u201cWhat they *actually* do is\u2014\u201d his voice trailed off there. \u201cYou know what, it\u2019s too spooky. We don\u2019t want Tom running off without any evidence, do we Ronan?\u201d\n\n\u201cStop milking it and tell the bloody story.\u201d\n\nDad\u2019s beam of light swept across the ground in low arcs. \u201cRonan, you wanna take this one?\u201d\n\nAround us, trees closed in from every angle. As we bullied our way along, our cheeks and arms were gouged by the lacings of sharp branches. It felt like the forest kept reaching out, placing hands on us. Almost against my will, I found myself admiring their resemblance to hideously elongated figures.\n\nSide-by-side with the developer, I cleared my throat. \u201cThe wooden people are like us. Or, well\u2026some are. Others not so much. Do you know what a doppelganger is?\u201d\n\n\u201cNooo,\u201d he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm.\n\n\u201cA doppelganger is\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s joking Ronan,\u201d Dad said, as he pushed through more scratching bracken. Beyond it, there lay an ocean of leaves, choked in darkness.\n\nI said, \u201cOh. So, there\u2019s this colony of wooden people who live out here in wooden towns. In the old days, they stayed away from us, and we stayed away from them. People didn\u2019t worry about them. Like hurricanes. If you lived somewhere that gets a lot of hurricanes, you\u2019d probably think about them, but in Ireland we\u2019ve never had a hurricane because it\u2019s not a warm tropical climate, so we don\u2019t worry about them. It was the same with wooden people. It was hard to stumble across them.\n\n\u201cBut then we started building cities and railways and stuff. That meant their homes kept getting destroyed. So, they started moving around. But then we started building *more* stuff so\u2014\u201d\n\nThrough a narrow gap, I glimpsed movement and hesitated. A chilly draught sent dead leaves scattering across my boots.\n\nMr. McCann said, \u201cLet me guess, soon they had so little space they got angry and attacked?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, no. First they tried to explain their problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, so our wooden friends speak English? They\u2019re like those talking trees in Game of Thrones are they?\u201d He went and stood beside a nearby birch, pressed his mouth up against a large hollow in its bulbous trunk, and said, \u201cHey Treebeard, you awake? Mind if I bulldoze this place?\u201d The entrepreneur faced us, grinning, those porcelain teeth prominent against the gloom. \u201cWell waddaya know, he said it\u2019s completely fine.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of a patch of dirt and mud and weeds, Dad said, \u201cQuiet, Both of you.\u201d\n\nBranches scraped together roughly as the forest shivered in its various joints.\n\n\u201cWhat is it, a fox?\u201d Mr. McCann asked.\n\nDad silenced him with a gesture. From somewhere unseen, whispers rang out. Or maybe it was just the wind. My trembling hand struggled to keep hold of the flashlight. Again and again, I wiped the palm sweat on my jacket and prayed Dad wouldn\u2019t notice.\n\nDad faced us. \u201cRonan, you stay here with Mr. McCann. I\u2019m gonna\u2014\"\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d the cynic fired back. \u201cIf I stay put, you\u2019ll go out there, smoke a cigarette, and come out panting like you\u2019ve just performed an exorcism.\u201d\n\nUnable to mask his agitation, Dad exhaled through his nostrils. \u201cYou came asking for my help, now I\u2019m giving it to you. Nobody\u2019s trying to rip you off, I promise. You don\u2019t live as part of nature, so you don\u2019t see it, but Ireland is bleeding magic. The world is. And now it\u2019s starting to fight back. If there\u2019s wooden people out here tonight, you\u2019re gonna leave this forest a changed man, believe me. But right now, I need you to listen.\u201d\n\nIt was strange to see dad angry; he was usually so even-keeled. To me, he said, \u201cRonan, I\u2019m going to go ahead and lure them out. Stay here and keep a candle lit in case they come this way.\u201d\n\nFrom my pack, I grabbed an Olympic-style torch and ignited it with a lighter tucked in the side compartment. The idea of not having Dad around for protection made my neck hairs stir. If the wooden people attacked, it would come down to me to protect us.\n\nMy father said, \u201cRemember Mr. McCann, whatever happens, don\u2019t let them touch you.\u201d\n\nThis warning was met with an eyeroll.\n\nFlashlight in hand, Dad disappeared behind a cluster of ash trees while I stood there, knees wobbling.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the trouble with you smalltown folk,\u201d Tom said, once the gloom swallowed Dad whole. \u201cAll these superstitions. This development could be a great opportunity, more tax revenue, more jobs. But instead you run around scared of things going bump in the night.\"\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re *not* superstitions,\u201d I snapped, more forcefully than intended. \u201cAnd besides, even if they were, animals live here too. Are we just gonna wreck *their* homes so you can make some money?\u201d\n\n\u201cKid, you see this?\u201d He tapped his Rolex. \u201cThis baby cost 50k. The Aston Martin I arrived in was triple that. Your Dad drives a 3-door hatchback that\u2019s older than you are, I heard that shit-heap sputtering up the road five minutes before you appeared. Here\u2019s some free advice: if you wanna make something of yourself, pull your head out of the clouds.\u201d\n\nAt the corner of my eye, a black blob filled the gaps between trees, briefly. After I cleared my throat I said, \u201cMoney isn\u2019t everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry to burst your bubble, kid, but it is. Why else would your old man be out here? If he was really set on protecting the forest, why take my money to do this phoney cleansing?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t have an answer for that, so I turned away instead.\n\nAnother gust of cold air made me shiver. A moment later, there came a trample of dead leaves.\n\nI choked out a feeble, \u201cDad?\u201d\n\nNo response.\n\n\u201cIs this the part where you stage an attack?\u201d Mr. McCann asked, acting bored. But did his voice wobble a little?\n\nBranches stirred as the forest took great, shuddery inhales. It sounded like whispers. The rhythm of my heart quickened.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice trick, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d Tom did a terrible job at sounding disinterested.\n\nMore whispers, behind us now. I said a silent prayer Dad arrived back and then whipped my torch and the flashlight around.\n\nIlluminated by the beam, there stood a huge, tumorous oak tree. From behind it, there came a skitter of rapid steps.\n\nI held out the torch like a shield. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\n\nMy companion hung over me like a shadow, so close his short, quick breaths blasted the back of my neck. What happened to all his bravado?\n\nBarely detectable even with the light, the tree inhaled, exhaled. I stood absolutely still, weapon raised and shaking.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Mr. McCann stuttered. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just the win\u2014\u201d\n\nBefore he could finish, a pair of eyes opened, cloudy and pale as though stricken by cataracts. Pressed against the tree a face peered back at us, like a mask made from living bark, and smiled.\n\nTogether, Mr. McCann and I screamed. My hands fumbled the torch, which slipped into a patch of mud and extinguished with a wet splatter.\n\nThe forest erupted into chatter and whispers. Behind us, up ahead, along both sides. I whipped the flashlight in one direction and the next. Anytime the beam landed on a tree there was yet another face, each grinning like a clowder of Cheshire cats.\n\nIn unison, figures stepped away from the trunks. From head to toe they were the texture rough bark, except for those pale eyes. Malignant growths engulfed the skulls, twigs and branches sprouted from shoulders and necks, and some were even dappled with furry moss. Limping with crude joints bent at odd angles, they shuffled toward us.\n\nA screaming Mr. McCann tore off through a narrow gap in the undergrowth. I rushed after him, unable to even think straight.\n\nWaist-deep foliage encroached on both sides of the trail, right up to our ankles. I followed the burly man through a maze of sticks and spears as he barrelled ahead, faster than my legs could carry me.\n\nOut of nowhere, he ground to a halt. As I caught up, the terrified man backstepped from *more* wooden people, too many to count. He spun on his heels, knocking me aside as he did, only to discover more closing in from behind, cutting off any hope of escape.\n\nTom choked out a weak, \u201cPlease, leave me alone. I\u2019ll give you anything. Money. Jewellery.\u201d He unclipped is Rolex and offered it as a gift. \u201cI\u2019ll never come back here. Please\u2026just\u2026\u201d\n\nTogether, they moved forward, limbs outstretched. They were so close now. So very close.\n\nAs Mr. McCann\u2019s foot caught on an exposed root, he collapsed backwards into the soil. All our tormenters came to a halt except for one, which continued on until it was close enough to reach out and touch a limb against Tom\u2019s forehead.\n\nOn his hands and knees, he spun away, scrambling toward me across the tangled floor. Already his face had sprouted warts. No, not warts\u2014saplings. Buds. The flesh of his cheeks and forehead bubbled, rapidly swelling in sections, while dark patches grew darker still across his neck, his forearms, his eyes, and even his lips. Paralyzed by fear, I could only watch.\n\nTears opened up along the sleeves of his tracksuit and ran up the shoulders, across the chest, and down the waist. In a matter of seconds Mr. McCann\u2019s limbs became bloated and elongated. His clothes fell to the floor in tattered ruins.\n\nNaked and deformed, he staggered to his feet and shuffled toward me, his screams now fading, his limbs stiff and awkward. Roots sprouted from his feet and grabbed the soil, biting deep, destroying any hope of forward progress. Through unmovable lips, he sputtered, \u201cHelp me\u2026please.\u201d Inside his mouth I saw a thick, green carpet.\n\nWithin seconds the man became indistinguishable from a small oak tree, one bough forever reaching forward, the branch lacing inches from my throat.\n\nWhat broke me out of my trance was the sound of puking. Past the tree that had formerly been Mr. McCann, the wooden person that touched him puked up splinters and moss. It\u2019s bark flaked and shed, exposing beige skin underneath. At the end of one limb, a fist opened and closed, revealing a human hand which then tore wood from a skull in huge chunks. Beneath these sections lay human features\u2014nose, ears, lips. The human flexed and cried and gulped for air, a hatchling emerging from its shell.\n\nI was so entranced by this hideous sight I didn\u2019t notice the other wooden people had closed in. After six petrified backsteps, a low branch thicker than an amputated forearm stabbed the small of my lower back. I spun around, heart clawing against my chest, only to discover I\u2019d reversed into the nearest wooden person.\n\nI dropped onto the ground, head buried in my lap. \u201cPlease,\u201d I whimpered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be one of you. Please.\u201d\n\nEven then my thoughts were of Dad, and what he might have thought seeing his son cower in fear like that.\n\nA hush fell over the forest. I took several short, shuddery inhales. That meant my lungs weren\u2019t solid. Yet.\n\nSlowly, I looked up. Wooden figures loomed over me, motionless. The closest one reeled away its limb.\n\n\u201cLet me through.\u201d My father\u2019s voice issued from within the crowd.\n\n\u201cDad?\u201d I cried.\n\nFigures stepped apart, clearing a path he stepped through. \u201cRonan.\u201d\n\nI got up and rushed forward and threw myself into his arms, my cheeks wet with tears. \u201cI dropped the torch, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShush, it\u2019s okay.\u201d He put a warm hand on my shoulder, and my nerves eased.\n\n\u201cBut Mr. McCann, he\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s completely fine.\u201d Dad stepped aside. Past his shoulder, a *new* Mr. McCann pulled on spare clothes Dad brought in his pack.\n\nA dry gulp seized my throat. \u201cWe need to run, we need to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, we\u2019re not in any danger.\u201d He pulled me in close. \u201cYou see son, there\u2019s something you need to know about us. About how I know so much about this place. You and I, Ronan, we were among the first. Years ago, before you were old enough to even remember, our people realized we needed a way to protect ourselves, so I volunteered to go speak with the humans. But they wouldn\u2019t listen. So now we\u2019re pushing back. Against those who want to destroy our home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re\u2026we\u2019re wooden people?\u201d\n\nDad squeezed my hand.\n\n\u201cBut what\u2019ll happen to Mr. McCann?\u201d\n\nHe gestured toward the tree that was once the real estate mogul. Any hiker who stumbled across it maybe would have made a casual remark about the vaguely human form, the warped portion of bough shaped vaguely like screaming face, forever etched in terror. You could practically hear the silent scream.\n\nTom McCann\u2014the *new* Tom McCann\u2014grabbed the discarded Rolex from the dirt and brushed it clean. He gave me a little smile and then clasped the watch around his wrist.\n\nI squeezed dad\u2019s hand even harder. \u201cBut couldn\u2019t we have helped him? We could have explained\u2014\u201d\n\nHe shook his head. \u201cIf we transformed one hundred Tom McCanns, a hundred more would just pop up. We need to replace them, son. All of them, the humans. It\u2019s like I said, the world is bleeding magic. And these flesh bags, they never learn. So, we\u2019re taking over. Not just here, but everywhere. England, Germany, Spain, America.\u201d\n\nHe kneeled down, brought himself eye level with me. \u201cAre you ready, son? Will you help us protect this world?\u201d\n\nI brushed away my tears, a new hardness in my stomach. [\u201cI will, Dad. I will.\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)",

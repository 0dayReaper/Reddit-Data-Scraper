    "postText": "Maria wants to be kept updated on the whole [Daniel situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13huynb/how_to_survive_college_i_have_a_name_and_a/).  No - scratch that - she feels obligated to stay informed.  She certainly doesn\u2019t want updates in the sort of way that you want to eat ice cream.  Rather, she\u2019s keeping track of the situation sort of like how you keep track of a leak in the basement or a particularly stubborn toenail fungus.\n\nI\u2019m kind of sad I\u2019m not using code names anymore because Toenail Fungus would be a great one for Daniel.  Is it too late to go back?  Has Daniel lost first-name privileges with ya\u2019ll?\n\nI probably shouldn\u2019t make this any more confusing than it already is.\n\n(if you\u2019re new, start [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rnauck/how_to_survive_the_holidays/), and if you\u2019re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/))\n\nWhen I updated Maria on how my conversation with the flickering man went, I also told her about the incident with the geology building ghost.  At the mention of his name, Maria\u2019s eyes lit up.  I recognized the look on her face.  It was the Rain Chaser Maria expression, when someone handed her a shiny tidbit of information like a new toy.\n\n\u201cDo you think his disappearance was in the news?\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t asking me.  She was speculating out loud.  I sat there, staring morosely at my keyboard.  We were in my dorm room. Cassie was out somewhere, I don\u2019t know where, but she\u2019d taken the petrified wood with her so I wasn\u2019t worried.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t in the town newspaper,\u201d she continued, \u201cit might be in the student one.  Look him up online!\u201d\n\n\u201cJames is a very common name,\u201d I replied.\n\n  \nShe stared at me for a moment, her jaw stubbornly set, and when I didn\u2019t move to open up a browser she pulled out her phone and started searching herself.  I waited.  She\u2019d give up in a moment.  There was no way this would be written down anywhere, not with the administration working to cover everything up and with students forgetting the ones that vanished.\n\n  \n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the library,\u201d she said, tossing the phone aside.\n\n  \n\u201cThis was only ten years ago.  They\u2019re not going to have any books that\u2019ll help us.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cNo, but they do have archives of the local newspapers, including the articles that weren\u2019t posted online or have since been taken down.  I just want to see if there\u2019s anything interesting that happened in the timeframe that James went missing.  It was right before graduation, so that narrows it down to just a few months worth of searching.\u201d\n\n  \nIt was actually a decent idea.  However, I didn\u2019t want her to follow through on it, so to stall for time while I thought of a way to dissuade her I told her I didn\u2019t want to go to the library.  That it made me nervous.\n\n  \nIt wasn\u2019t a great tactic but I never claimed to be good at thinking on my feet.\n\n  \n\u201cWhat are you scared of?\u201d she demanded.  \u201cIf the library floods, we\u2019ll just leave.  No messing around.  I promise.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d I said.  I\u2019m not worried about the library itself.\u201d\n\n  \nI hesitated.  I hadn\u2019t told her about the administration\u2019s involvement.  I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve told her some of my suspicions, because we\u2019ve speculated on how the university has hidden all of this, but I\u2019m pretty sure I didn\u2019t tell her how the flickering man has confirmed there\u2019s someone watching over all the inhumans, because then I\u2019d have to tell her about the flickering man\u2019s grudge and I am not getting her involved in that.\n\n  \nI hesitated long enough that Maria grew impatient waiting for me to decide.\n\n  \n\u201cAshley,\u201d she said and there was a faint edge to her voice, \u201cI thought we were better friends than this.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cI\u2019m just worried!\u201d I blurted out.  \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to get you killed if I tell you something I shouldn\u2019t!\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cOkay, but have you considered that maybe I could get killed by not knowing something?  Aren\u2019t you the one writing up a list of rules for people to follow?\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d I mumbled.\n\n  \nIt is, isn\u2019t it?  I\u2019m not telling them everything.  I\u2019m just putting in enough information to be memorable and sound ominous, in the hopes they\u2019ll remember what to do if the time comes.\n\n  \n\u201cDidn\u2019t your therapist talk to you about this?\u201d Maria said.\n\n  \nI shifted uncomfortably in my seat.  So you\u2019re not the only people I\u2019ve talked to about my on-going therapy and how I\u2019m trying to stop blaming myself for things I can\u2019t control.  I just didn\u2019t expect Maria to throw it back in my face like this.\n\n  \nRude.\n\n  \n\u201cListen,\u201d Maria said patiently.  \u201cIf I get killed by a monster, it\u2019ll be my own fault for pursuing this stuff.  The only way you\u2019ll be to blame is if you, I don\u2019t know, trade my life for eldritch powers or something, which you\u2019re not about to do.  And honestly, if what you want to tell me has the potential to put me into danger just by knowing it, then I\u2019d still rather know.\u201d\n\n  \nShe paused.\n\n  \n\u201cAfter all,\u201d she continued quietly, \u201cit\u2019s putting you in danger and I don\u2019t want you to have to deal with that alone.\u201d\n\n  \nAnyway I got teary-eyed when she said that and said I was a bad friend and she said I wasn\u2019t and then I told her about how I\u2019m like 99% certain that the administration not only knows what\u2019s going on, but that they\u2019ve got a hand in controlling the inhuman creatures.  My biggest fear, I said, was that they\u2019d find out what we\u2019re up to and come after us.\n\n  \n\u201cLike what, we could get expelled?\u201d she said.\n\n  \n\u201cMore like expelled from life,\u201d I muttered.\n\n  \n\u201cOhhhh.  Okay yeah I can see why you\u2019re nervous.\u201d\n\n  \nShe\u2019d broaden her search, she said.  Hit a couple other years for the same timeframe at random.  Make it harder to pinpoint what exactly she was looking for.  That was assuming the administration was monitoring the library at all, it was a big campus with a lot of people and they couldn\u2019t even catch the assholes that sometimes pulled the fire alarm in the middle of the night.  She didn\u2019t have much confidence that they could pull off mass surveillance to ensure no one found out too much about the monsters roaming campus.\n\n  \n\u201cThey let us run the Rain Chasers, after all,\u201d she said brightly.\n\n  \n\u201cI don\u2019t think you were close to finding out anything dangerous.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cMaybe not.  But they also let it reform and this time it\u2019s got a professor\u2019s close guidance.\u201d\n\n  \nYeah.  That\u2019s right.  The Rain Chasers were all set to dissolve and then the sponsor got involved and went to great lengths to ensure that didn\u2019t happen.  If the administration really wanted to keep everything secret, it would have been easy to just quietly inform the folklore professor that she needed to give her club up.\n\n  \n\u201cThough they probably just need a group of students to use as human sacrifices in a pinch,\u201d I muttered.  \u201cLike what they did with Patricia.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cNope, I know how this goes,\u201d she said, standing abruptly.  \u201cEvery time you bring up Patricia you then get all mopey and spend the evening doomscrolling the internet to make yourself feel worse.\u201d\n\n  \nShe grabbed my wrist.\n\n  \n\u201cC\u2019mon, we\u2019re going to the library.\u201d\n\n  \nNow, I have been to the library a few times since last year.  While a lot of stuff is accessible online, sometimes it\u2019s just easier to go to a section labeled with the topic you need to write a paper on and start pulling out books.  I\u2019ve found that\u2019s a great way to get a lot of citations in a short amount of time.  So I haven\u2019t been avoiding the library.  I also have gone there a few times with Cassie and even once with Maria since the school year started.  Nothing out of the ordinary happened.  \nI\u2019ve tried to think back on the timeline of when I last went to the library.  Was it before the graveyard visit?  I can\u2019t remember.  I just know that sometime in between my last visit and the one I am about to describe, something has changed.\n\n  \nWith me.\n\n  \nMaria\u2019s research was uneventful, at least.  She didn\u2019t find anything useful.  Unsurprisingly, the local newspapers' physical copies were deep in storage somewhere and would need a special request to get them out.  Maria seemed about to ask for that, but I was in her peripheral vision signaling no, we shouldn't do anything that leaves a record of any kind, and she reluctantly told the front desk to not bother.  We\u2019d just search the digital archives instead.  Which we could have done from the comfort of my dorm, but whatever, we were here so might as well stay and make use of a distraction free environment.\n\n  \nWe got a couple computer desks and Maria started searching while I worked on homework.  I think we were there for about an hour before I noticed something strange.\n\n  \nSomeone was staring at me from across the room.  \n\n  \nWe were on the second floor, where all the computers were.  The stacks were below us on the first floor.  The layout of this floor was interesting in that they didn\u2019t have enclosed rooms, but rather walls strategically placed to create alcoves that were out of sight from each other.  Each section had a handful of computers, scattered in groups of two throughout the area.  The alcove we\u2019d taken was empty when we arrived.\n\n  \nThe newcomer stood at the edge of the room, one hand raised to rest on the wall.  I recognized him.  We\u2019d met before.\n\n  \nWater dripped from his bent elbow.\n\n  \nI elbowed Maria and she glanced up.  She hadn\u2019t gotten a look at the library ghost, on account of the whole almost drowning thing, so I mouthed who he was to her.  Her eyes went big and there was a glint of excitement in them.  I\u2019d hoped she was over that but\u2026 I guess she hadn\u2019t changed as much as I thought.\n\n  \n\u201cGo talk to it!\u201d she whispered.\n\n  \n\u201cNo!\u201d I hissed back.\n\n  \n\u201cC\u2019mon, you\u2019ve encountered it a couple times already, it has to be here for you.  It\u2019s fine, he\u2019s helpful, right?\u201d\n\n  \nEven helpful inhumans can be dangerous.  But she had a point.  He was staring directly at me.  I ground my teeth together and stood.  His eyes remained steady on me as I walked over.\n\n  \n\u201cSo,\u201d I said, \u201chi?\u201d\n\n  \nSeriously, what do you say to a ghost?  He stared back at me, a mournful expression on his face.  I watched as a droplet of water ran down his forehead, along the bridge of his nose, and finally dripped off onto the carpet.\n\n  \n\u201cThanks for all your help last time,\u201d I said.  \u201cThat was scary.  The eyeball is gone, by the way, but maybe you already know that\u2026\u201d\n\n  \nI trailed off.  His gaze was unnerving, staring at me like that without speaking.  He\u2019d spoken to me before, so it wasn\u2019t like this silence was required by his nature or anything.  He was choosing not to say anything.  I glanced backwards at Maria to see if she had any helpful suggestions.\n\n  \n\u201cI don\u2019t want you here anymore,\u201d he said abruptly.\n\n  \nMy head snapped back to stare at him.  His expression hadn\u2019t changed.  It didn\u2019t seem to match the anger in his voice.\n\n  \n\u201cI didn\u2019t bring the eyeball on purpose, I swear,\u201d I said.\n\n  \nBut he only shook his head at me.\n\n  \n\u201cThat\u2019s not it.  I can\u2019t trust you anymore.\u201d\n\n  \nThen he grabbed my arm and started dragging me towards the nearest window.  I gasped and dug in my heels, but the library ghost is strong.  I think that\u2019s kind of unfair.  Inhumans are stronger than humans just in general, but of all things I feel like a ghost should be an exception.  Or maybe ghost is the wrong thing to call him.\n\n  \nRegardless of what he is, he is tangible, and he was able to drag me across the room as if he were a statue and all my cursing and punching came to nothing.  Maria joined the fray, first grabbing hold of me and then putting herself bodily between the ghost and the window.  He merely shoved her aside.\n\n  \nThe window.  Why the window?\n\n  \nUnless he intended to evict me from the library through it.\n\n  \n\u201cI\u2019ll leave!\u201d I cried desperately.  \u201cI swear I will!  I\u2019ll leave and I won\u2019t come back!\u201d\n\n  \nThree feet away now.  Two.  His grip twisted around on my arm, as if he were preparing himself to throw something.  I raised my arms to protect my head, breathless, wondering if I landed on something expendable - like an arm or my legs - if I would survive the fall with only a few broken bones.\n\n  \nThen the ghost stopped.  He closed his eyes and sighed.  And he vanished.  Just\u2026 gone.\n\n  \nI stood there dumbly for a moment with my heart pounding.\n\n  \n\u201cWhat\u2026 just happened?\u201d I whispered.\n\n  \n\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out somewhere else!\u201d  She was already shoving things back into my backpack.  \u201cLet\u2019s get out while we can.\u201d\n\n  \nI wasn\u2019t going to argue.  We hastily packed up our belongings and hurried for the stairs.  When we reached the first floor, we found that there was water up to our waists already.  \n\n  \nBecause of course there was.\n\n  \nMaria and I glanced at each other and her expression mirrored my own.  This was bullshit.  Total bullshit.\n\n  \n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d I get it,\u201d I mumbled.  \u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d\n\n  \nI sloshed into the water.  At least this explained why the ghost had abandoned me so abruptly.  He was probably off escorting someone lost in the stacks to safety.  I had no intention to go find them.  I wouldn\u2019t be of any help and if the library ghost no longer liked me, then I\u2019d only make it worse.  The ghost would be enough.  He\u2019d done this plenty of times.\n\n  \nThe water had receded at the exit and we stepped outside without any trouble.  I was all set to go back to my dorm, but Maria wanted to wait and see if anyone else with wet clothing exited the library.  She wanted to make sure whoever the ghost had gone to fetch made it out okay.\n\n  \nAt least, that\u2019s what she said.  I think she also wanted to quiz me on why the ghost didn\u2019t want me around anymore and I couldn\u2019t tell her much.  The only theory I have is that it\u2019s because of my friendship with Grayson, but Maria doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s the president\u2019s son and I\u2019m not going to tell her that.\n\n  \nThe ghost also didn\u2019t like Patricia.  I did tell Maria that, and Maria said we didn\u2019t have much in common that she was aware of.  She was quick to dismiss this theory, possibly because of the whole \u2018Ashley gets sad when Patricia is mentioned\u2019 thing.\n\n  \nInside the library, the water steadily continued to rise against the glass doors.  Students came and went, oblivious, and it was an unnerving sight to watch them open the door and step inside a wall of water.  The water had risen to the ceiling by that point and it felt surreal to see people walking about underwater, unaware that anything was wrong.\n\n  \nThen someone slammed against the door.  A woman.  She was floating in the water, her long hair spread around her, and she was beating on the glass in an attempt to force the door open.  \nThis was who the library ghost had gone to save.\n\n  \nExcept she couldn\u2019t get out.\n\n  \nMaria was instantly on her feet and was running for the front of the library.  Her immediate reaction broke me out of my shock and then I was right behind her.  She had hold of the library door handle and was pulling as hard as she could.  I joined her.  \n\n  \nI grabbed hold and heaved, putting all my strength into it, but the door wouldn\u2019t budge.  The woman slammed at the glass with both hands, her eyes wide with terror.  I lowered my center of gravity, getting more of my leg strength behind it, but still we could not free the woman trapped inside.\n\n  \nWe were going to watch her drown, I realized.  I felt the strength leaving my body and despair creeping in.  She was going to drown in front of us and there was nothing I could do to stop it.  \nThen another pair of hands - a man\u2019s - joined us.\n\n  \n\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d he yelled at the woman.  \u201cI\u2019m going to get you out!\u201d\n\n  \nHe knew her.  You could hear it in his voice.\n\n  \nAnd the door gave.  It slipped open only an inch, but that was all we needed.  The water began to escape in a rush and it felt like a deep, shuddering sigh emanated from the building.  It relinquished its prey.  The woman came tumbling out in a deluge of water.  She sat there on the pavement, gasping for breath, looking around her in amazement that she was here, in the clean air, alive.\n\n  \nThen the young man grabbed her elbows.  She stared at him a moment, he shook her a little, and that snapped her back to reality.  Her eyes focused on his face.\n\n  \n\u201cI came to meet you here - but - what happened?\u201d he asked, bewildered.  \u201cI-I\u2019ve heard the library flooded but thought it was just-just a story.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cI just - I was - going to check out these books - it swept me back into the library,\u201d she gasped.  \u201cI-I think I lost the books.  I really wanted them too\u2026\u201d\n\n  \nHe froze for a moment.  Took a deep breath.\n\n  \n\u201cHow were you going to check those out?  You have a stack of them in your dorm room that are, what, months overdue at this point!\u201d\n\n  \nHe was yelling in that sort of way that you use when you\u2019re mad over something trivial because you\u2019re too scared to yell about what you\u2019re actually mad about, which is how you almost lost them.  Look, I grew up in a big family, we did some dumb things growing up, I know what that sort of yelling sounds like.\n\n  \nThen she admitted that she\u2019d asked him to meet her there so she could check them out under his name and that just made everything so much better.\n\n  \nMaria gestured for me to follow her away from the scene unfolding in front of the library.  The rescued student was crying now and her boyfriend was sort-of-apologizing-but-not-really  and it was better if they sorted this out between them without an audience.  Staring at what could potentially turn into a very messy breakup if handled incorrectly was kind of rude.\n\n  \n\u201cOverdue books!\u201d Maria hissed.  \u201cShe had overdue books!\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\n  \nMaria huffed, apparently annoyed by my inability to read her mind.\n\n  \n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to figure out the triggering conditions for all these creatures on campus, right?\u201d she said.  \u201cSo what\u2019s the trigger for the flood?\u201d\n\n  \nI opened my mouth to say \u2018the ghost\u2019 but then immediately closed it.  No, that was wholly incorrect.  They were connected, but the ghost didn\u2019t show up until after the flood arrived and then it was to save whoever was caught in it.\n\n  \n\u201cGetting lost?\u201d I ventured.  \u201cWe got lost and then it started flooding.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cWhat if that\u2019s not related though?  What if there are multiple phenomena in the library and they have separate triggers?  We were lost for a while before the flood showed up.\u201d\n\n  \nI glanced back at the girl.  What Maria was saying was starting to make sense.  The rescued student had gasped out that she was on her way out of the stacks when the flood pulled her back in.\n\n  \nOur conversation paused for a moment as the boyfriend\u2019s voice rose in volume for just a moment as he yelled, \u201cYou have to return them at some point!!\u201d at her.  We waited to ensure the shouting was done for the time being and then returned to our own conversation.\n\n  \n\u201cSo assuming the ghost, the flood, and the maze are all separate occurrences that sometimes happen together,\u201d I said slowly, \u201cwe\u2019d need to find triggers for all three.  The ghost is obviously the flood.  He rescues people from the flood.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cThe maze is probably wandering around in the stacks without other people nearby,\u201d Maria said.  \u201cThat\u2019s what we were doing.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cAnd then the flood is\u2026\u201d\n\n  \nWe both glanced back at the girl and then over to the doors of the library, the glass doors catching the light just enough to obscure whatever lay behind them.\n\n  \n\u201cIt\u2019s the library\u2019s way of defending itself,\u201d Maria said quietly.\n\n  \nIt came for the girl because she had too many overdue books and no intention of returning them anytime soon.  I doubt it was malice towards the library - my personal theory is she was likely prone to procrastination and then the problem had piled up until it was now a big problem and she was too embarrassed or too overwhelmed to address it directly.\n\n  \nI\u2019ve never done anything like that, oh no, not me.\n\n  \nBut the library had its own set of rules and she\u2019d violated them.\n\n  \n\u201cWe were talking,\u201d Maria said quietly, \u201cthe day it flooded on us.\u201d\n\n  \nAnd I admit that we were being kind of noisy.  Maria was excited.  She\u2019s loud when she\u2019s excited.  \nLibraries are quiet places.  You are supposed to be silent inside them.\n\n  \nThe library also flooded on the day the eyeball followed me there.  Was it because I\u2019d brought the creature with me?  Or because I\u2019d almost dropped one of their only copies of a book?\n\n  \nI think\u2026 this needs to be a rule.  Something about how the library has its own set of rules and how you can\u2019t break them\u2026 or something something bad things happen.  \n\n  \nI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m finishing this post up well after midnight here because I make poor life choices so I\u2019ll think about it and update the rules another day.[\\[x\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)\n\n[Read the current draft of the rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/t34mbv/how_to_survive_college/)\n\n[Visit the college's website.](https://alderrayne.com/)",

But since you said his expression didn 't match his voice I wonder; maybe something was watching him? like a coalition of inhumans and he had to tell you to leave bc of them and sound angry, but his face was signaling that he wasn't really angry. the window thing might just be that he's been inhuman for so long that he forgot that throwing someone out a window kinda kills them.\n\nor maybe you're right and now that the inhumans know you're friends with Greyson, they don't trust you anymore. perhaps they think even if you don't wanna hurt them, admin could plant something on you? or just a general aversion to  anything admin related. you could test this theory by trying to approach another inhuman, perhaps the laundry lady since she's friendly enough. or the devil, he promised to get you to graduate.\n\ngood idea on the library rules though! I definitely think you're right, makes me wonder how the drowned student died. maybe he had a TON of overdue books. also feels related to how you can't disturb the student fixing computers. it's their job and you disturbing them is breaking a rule",

It's also possible the library ghost got killed by the flickering man and that's why the library floods? Or the flickering man causes the floods somehow?",

His duty is to save people - the way to make him angry is to refuse his help! - so the fact that Ashley just gave Daniel to the flickering man should make him upset, even if the former was an asshole.

The ghosts also seem bound to the buildings in which they died, which is pretty classic ghost stuff, and the way they died is evident because you can see it in their ghostly form. The two ghosts you've met so far have died in ways that are not explicitly supernatural -- drowning and a bunch of stab wounds.   \n\n\nWhile I concede that it's supernatural *seeming* that the classroom ghost's stabbing implements keep changing, technically, a human could be killed by another human by being stabbed a bunch of times, and idk if the changing of implements is necessarily more supernatural than the way the classroom ghost clings to the ceiling like an insect. (Maybe that's somehow related to the millipede stuff in the lecture hall?)   \n\n\nI wonder what separates the ghost students from the (one assumes) hundreds of other students who have died on campus over the years. Is it related to how they were killed? Where they were killed? What killed them? It seems like the library flood is indifferent to how many witnesses are around, and I wonder if the same is true for other buildings. Maybe classroom ghost was killed by a building itself rather than by an inhuman. I'm excited to learn more as you learn more! Stay safe!",

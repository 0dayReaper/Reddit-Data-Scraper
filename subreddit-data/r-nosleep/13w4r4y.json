    "postText": "\"Come inside, the kids are upstairs.\" Molly was in a rush, I knew this much from the phone call we had earlier. She had never used me before but heard about me through word of mouth. Which meant that my little side hustle was starting to gain traction.\n\nI am a babysitter for a good neighborhood. There's cars parked outside, lawns are manicured, and the occasional termite company is out doing rounds. I don't know why but I always feel as if there's a termite guy nearby, it's a pretty decent area. Which is a far cry from where I live, on the other side of the tracks, literally. There are train tracks that run through our town and it acts as a divide. But they didn't need to know that. They only needed to see the straightened hair, well spoken, fake braces wearing girl in glasses sporting a skirt that wasn't too short where the neighbors would talk.\n\nUsually I sat down with new clients, have them introduce me to their kids (trust me it helps) in order to make a clear cut line with them that I am in their parent's employ and I am not there to be their bestfriend and will definitely tell on them if they act up or break something. That's not to say I won't play silly games with them, feed them, laugh, tell bed time stories, and age appropriate jokes. But I am nobody's rug.\n\nThat's what I usually do, but there wasn't such luxury this time. Molly called me on the phone and she sounded desperate for me to come out. I had concert tickets and told her that they were non-refundable and she suggested that if I could make it in 30 minutes then she'd pay me twice the amount for the tickets and 1.5x my usual rate. I got there in 29 minutes. It would have been sooner but I needed to air myself out if you know what I mean.\n\nAnyways, Molly barely had time to look at my face, let alone get any of my credentials as she was rushing out. Working mom it looked like. Business, by the looks of the pencil skirt and the bag that doubled as a folder. It always amazes me how much trust some people put in others to watch their kids. What if I was a serial killer? Or a deranged lunatic? What if I killed the babysitter on my way here and now I'm in a house, alone, with all her children.\n\nI'm not. But I mean, what if, right?\n\nShe didn't seem to think about any of these things, leaving me to mumble goodbyes as she pulled out of the driveway, barely audible as the turbos wound up and she shouted something out the window to the likes of, \"It's all on the iPad\".\n\nYeah, no more yellow lined paper stuck with the realtor's magnet on the fridge anymore. It's all digital now.\n\nI closed the door and figured that I better check up on the kids before I did a rundown. God this house was beautiful. I climbed the stairs two at a time and rounded the hall. To be fair, calling it a hall was so basic of me. It was more like a wing. West wing madam. The wing could have fit my living room. I click my heels when I heard a snort come from behind me. I came to face a shaggy dog that was well groomed. The collar was black with an underline of blue. Tiffany's undoubtedly. \"Hey,\" I reached a hand and scratched the mop of top. \"Let's go find the kids,\" I tell the dog as if it could understand me.\n\nThere were a series of rooms, most of them closed, but it didn't take me a second guess which one was occupied. The second door on the left, I could hear a kid shouting obscenities about someone being trash. I knocked on that door first.\n\n\"Come in,\" he shouted still loud but slightly less angry.\n\nI opened the door and saw a stereotypical gamer's room. Posters, action figures, a rocking gaming chair on the floor in front of a huge flat screen, and a boy about 9 or 10. He had on his headphones and was sipping a Dr. Pepper.\n\n\"Don't they know trash day is on Thursdays?\"\n\nHe cocked his head and laughed, \"If you're looking for my mom I think she's downstairs.\"\n\n\"I'm actually looking for you.\" And let me tell you something. The audacity of this younger generation. The way he looked at me. Almost made me feel as bad as how I felt when he shrugged his shoulders after he had a good look. \"Excuse me,\" I walk in front of him and blocked the screen. \"I'm your new babysitter.\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"Cool.\"\n\n\"What's your name?\"\n\n\"You can read all about it somewhere else.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It's all on the iPad,\" he told me.\n\n\"What's your name,\" I repeated.\n\nHe rolls his eyes and looks at me as if I had asked him a stupid question, \"Well I'm not Max.\"\n\nI don't budge.\n\nHe whined, \"Bobbie. Now come on, the next rounds about to start.\" he pulled his headphones over his ears. I grabbed the remote to get his attention. \"What. Hey come on.\"\n\n\"It's nice to meet you Bobbie. Your mom's going to be away for a few hours and I'll be here until she gets back. Dinner is at 6:00 and I will make snacks at 4:30.\"\n\n\"No cap,\" he motioned at the tv, \"Now can I get back to my game.\n\n\"Sure I tell him.\" Pocketing the remote.\n\n\"Hey!\"\n\n\"Bye,\" I tell him as I close the door behind me.\n\nSo I'm back out in the hallway. And I open a few more doors. Some were locked. Before I get into one that's rather plain. There's a picture hanging up behind the bed, a tv, some lamps and shade. On the bed sits an identical, about 9 or 10, twins it seems. Probably why Bobbie was tired of being asked which one he was.\n\nThis one was staring at the blank screen. No video games. And quiet. Now I've babysat my share of kids before, and have seen all sorts. Quiet kids are my favorite. They don't mind board games, or listening. Most often times they only need to be left alone. I don't do too much talking in case they get tired of hearing my voice. And I give them a lot of space. \"Hey, sorry about that. I didn't think anyone was in here.\"\n\nHe turned to me slowly, \"Hi. Are you the new sitter?\"\n\nI nodded, \"Yup. And I'm guessing that you're Max. I'll be watching you guys while your mom is away.\"\n\n\"She's probably going to work.\"\n\n\"Yeah, looked like it.\" I see the iPad in his hands. \"Hey. I was looking for that.\"\n\n\"She's always at work.\" He hands it over. \"It's dead. And mom took the charger.\"\n\nI tried not to sigh. This was not how I wanted things to go. \"Well, ok. If you need anything. Let me know. Or else I can come get you at 4:30 for snacks and dinner at 6.\"\n\nHe nodded, \"Thanks,\" and goes back to staring at the screen.\n\nI smile but he doesn't see, so I leave, closing the door softly behind me.\n\nI make my way downstairs, wandering into the kitchen and start taking stock of what's there. Which was practically everything. This kitchen was so chic that I half expected Gordon Ramsay to pop out and tell me that the banana bread I made didn't have a clue if he staked the curved yellow fruit down the middle (it's a bad question mark joke. Listen. I never said I was funny).\n\nOnce I made sure that there was food, or ingredients to make food. There wasn't much else to do. The house was spotless. The kids were fine. And even the dog seemed well behaved. So I plopped on the couch, took out my fake braces, and watched tv until about 4:10 before I started slicing apples and celery to go with some peanut butter.\n\nI fed the dog some peanut butter and licked my fingers (not with the hand I fed the dog with), before heading upstairs. Bobbie took the plate no problem but I couldn't find Max for the life of me. I wandered the rooms as the dog followed, still trying to lick my hand. \"Max, I've got snacks.\" I knocked on what seemed like the umpteenth door before I get to a rather solid oak one that seemed custom.\n\nInside was the biggest home library I had ever seen. And I once dog sat for a pretentious professor from the college nearby. I mean, there was a portrait of said academic holding his dog in 18th century art style hanging over the mantle place of the deep wood cabinets filled with books. And yet this library made the other one look like a neighborhood book exchange birdbox.\n\n\"Holy...\"\n\n\"Cow.\"\n\nI whirled around to find Max standing in the doorway.\n\n\"You shouldn't wander into Father's study.\"\n\n\"I was just looking for you,\" holding up the plate. He made a face. \"What? You don't like PB&amp;C?\" I took a stick and crunched on the celery.\n\n\"I'm not hungry.\"\n\nI shrug. \"Take it anyway. In case you get hungry.\"\n\nHe grabs the plate from me without much struggle so I decide to leave him be. I went back downstairs and crashed in front of the tv.\n\nWhen I woke up. It was dark. My mouth was dry and all of the lights were off. The screen saver flashed the logo in blinks, lighting up the room only momentarily. For a second I forgot where I was and felt my heart thumping in my chest. My alarm didn't go off but I don't know why I woke up. Then I heard it again. The sound that must have jerked me awake. A crash. It came from upstairs. I grab my phone and glance down at the numbers. It was 8:10. I had slept through dinner. Shit. Shit. Shit. Here I was trying to make a good first impression and I missed out on dinner.\n\nI wipe what drool was on my face and took to the stairs. Bobbie was probably so immersed in his game that he probably didn't even know he was hungry. Max on the other hand. \"Max?\" I call out down the hall. All of the doors are shut. I can hear something panting behind me. I turn to see the dog again. Its head is down and there's barely any light touching its face. \"Hey come here,\" I called but it retreated in the opposite direction.\n\nThen I shit me not. I heard a creaking come from behind me. It was the only noise in the house. I couldn't even hear Bobbie yelling in his room. I turn slowly and see one of the doors down the hall is now slightly ajar. It's dark in here. It was dark everywhere. I pressed my hands against the wall searching for a light switch. \"Bobbie,\" I call out. There's no answer. \"Hey, sorry about the delay in dinner. I'm going to get to it now.\"\n\nWhy was this place so big? And why could I see the door?\n\n\"Bobbie. Max?\" I hear the dog tapping its paws behind me. Someone on the other side of the house by now. \"Hey, where are you guys?\" I peer at the single door that's open and realized why it was so prominent. The hall was dark, but what was inside was even darker. Instead of going toward it, I try the first knob my blind fingers came across. Process of elimination I told myself. It was locked. I tried the next one. Also locked. I finally get to Bobbie's door and I knock. \"Bobbie.\" There's no answer. I press my head against the door and listen. But I don't hear a single sound.\n\n\"Where are all the light switches in this place!\"\n\nThe door that was open before slightly opens again. Creaking, \\*tic tic tic tic\\*, with each ungreased turn of the hinge. \"Shit. Hey, stop playing around.\"\n\nThere's laughing coming from behind me. It sounded like a little kids. Too young to be either of the boys. Followed by smaller footsteps. It sounded like they were barefoot. \"Hey, this isn't funny. I'm going to tell your mother when she gets home.\" I take out my phone and turn on the flashlight. \"When is she coming home?\" It was almost 8:30, when I realized that we never set a time.\n\nI hear footsteps again, they were odd. Almost like falling. Like a toddler learning how to run for the first time but the hollow ground sounded as if the person was much heavier. I shine my flashlight over the hall. \"Shit.\" The dog was sitting on all fours in the corner. It was facing the wall. I couldn't even see his face. Every hair on its body completely still.\n\n\"Hey,\" I called out. \"Come here.\" I clicked my tongue. \"Come here.\" The dog didn't move. I couldn't even see it breathing.\n\nBang! It sounded like thunder behind me. As if someone dropped something on the floor. As if something fell off a shelf or was pushed. I jumped around and shone my light down the west wing. I didn't know if I should have been more or less afraid now that the door was closed. \"Bobbie? Max?\"\n\nGod. I did not want to try the door. And I stood there for a minute before realizing how stupid I must have looked. These were some rich kids playing a joke on you Camilia. I know it. The thought of their smug little faces made me stomp out of my frozen state. I took a couple of strides over and grabbed the handle.\n\n\"Fuck!\" The thing was hot. \"What the hell! You guys could have hurt me,\" I yelled. I banged on the door. \"Open up. You two are in so much trouble.\" I banged on the door again. \"Open the door. Right now!\" I could hear something on the other side. It sounded like shuffling. Heavy furniture perhaps. \"You guys better not be messing things up in there. I'm not going to clean it. I mean it.\"\n\nI banged on the door. \"I can hear you in there! Now come on!\" I put my hands on my hips and tapped my foot. \"I'm waiting. Your little jokes over now.\" I banged on the door again.\n\nThat's when the door knocked back.\n\nIt wouldn't have scared me. I don't think. Except for the fact that I was surprised. And alone in the hall. Without any of the lights on. In a strange house. And before I could say anything else. Another door behind me knocked from the inside. \"Shit. Both of you are in on this?\" I grabbed the handle to the other door. It was also locked. I banged on it. \"Come out right now. Max?\"\n\nBut then a third door started knocked from down the hall. I felt my throat clump as I tried to swallow. \"You guys weren't supposed to have anyone over.\" The knocking didn't stop. It kept echoing down the hall. \"I'm not getting paid for three kids you know?\"\n\nTat-tat-tat-tat. Tat-tat-tat.\n\nI took a single step. And then all of the doors in the hallway suddenly started banging.\n\nI almost tripped as I ran toward the stairs. The doors were thundering on so hard I thought they would crack their hinges. I skipped the stairs, the sounds chasing me as I tried to not fall and break my neck. When I got to the front landing I hear someone say my name.\n\n\"Camilia. Are you okay?\"\n\nI'm trying not to choke on a lung here as I shot my eyes toward the kitchen. The kids are sitting on the barstools lining the counter. There are two plates in front of them. As if they didn't hear the drumline upstairs.\n\n\"Is it dinner time yet,\" one of them asks quietly.\n\n\"Max?\"\n\nHe smiles.\n\n\"Kids. I think there's someone in the house.\" I rush over to grab each of their hands. Bobbie's wrists are limp but it was Max's hands that shocked me. They were ice cold. I tried to let go but my fingers wouldn't uncurl.\n\nHe turns my hand over and says, \"There's no one else in this house except us. I promise.\"\n\n\"No,\" I wasn't about to listen to the kid even if it was his house. \"Something is wrong. We have to go. Now.\" I pick up Bobbie and he doesn't seem to want to move. \"Come on Bobbie. Let's go.\" He looks over at Max who shrugs and get out of his seat.\n\nBobbie follows as I drag them toward the front door.\n\n\"Camilia,\" Max says.\n\n\"What?\" He looked scared. Which made me turn toward what he was staring out. At the front door was a tall figure. I couldn't see its face through the glass. It was a stark figure of a man.\n\n\"Do you think it's your dad?\"\n\nMax shakes his head. I feel him pulling against my arm.\n\nI call out to the man, \"Hey! Who is it?\" The man doesn't budge. \"I'm calling the police.\" I turn to Bobbie, \"Get the phone.\" He doesn't move. \"Hey!\" I'm trying to sound as angry as possible. \"Get the fuck out of here!\" I grabbed a roll of painter's tape from the side table and hurl it across the hall, hitting the glass squarely in the face where the man's head stood blocking the exit. He doesn't even twitch as the glass shakes.\n\n\"Come on,\" I grab their hands and rush to the back. I don't get 10 steps before I feel a scream crawl up my throat making me cough. The man was standing at the sliding door. \"Fuck!\" I drag the two of them with me towards the kitchen. It's a big place so there had to be a way out to the garage. We push through one of the doors and end up in the laundry room. The next door gets us out into a 3 car garage. My hands find the glowing green opener against the wall and I hear the opener fold seamlessly towards the ceiling.\n\nIt started with his feet. Then his ankles. His shins. Then his legs. Light poured in behind him from the streetlamp. I watched as the door went to his waist before I hit the button for the garage to close, before rushing back inside. We make it into the kitchen to where I still see the tall man standing at the sliding door. A part of me wants to hide in the laundry room but I didn't want to be sandwiched in the middle of the house. So I pull the boys back up the stairs, back to where the doors banged themselves. Taking out my phone as we ascended, and called 911.\n\n\"This is the police operator speaking.\"\n\n\"HELLO\", I hope they could hear me, \"There are several men trying to get inside!\"\n\n\"Men? Are you in any danger?\"\n\n\"No! But they have us surrounded!\"\n\n\"Why don't you go outside?\"\n\nMy tongue suddenly felt numb in my mouth. Like I didn't know what to do with it. \"W-what?\"\n\n\"It's stranger in the house.\"\n\nThe line went dead as we hit the hallway.\n\nI only took my eyes off of them for a second before Bobbie. Or Max. Runs down the hall. The one or the other already slipping through a door ahead. I look back down the stairs and see that the man is still standing in front of the doorway. I look back up and see the other boy also going through the same door. I take a single step and the doors start pounding on either side. I shut my eyes and turn around. Afraid to go. Almost deciding that these weren't my kids. That I should run away. I take a step backwards mouthing that I was sorry. But I was too scared to go! \"Max! Bobbie!\" My back foot sticks to the floor. I don't want to look down but the next step sticks too. I point my phone to the ground and see a trail of blood. And just behind me. It's the dog. Split right down the middle, its spine shiny and white, still facing the wall. I could see its organs still pulsing.\n\nI couldn't go back downstairs. I couldn't go the other way. I couldn't leave them here. I couldn't be alone.\n\nI ran after them. The thundering of the doors following me as frames fell to the floor. A vase rolled off a table in the hall. It came crashing at my feet. I run my shoulder through the door, except it wasn't locked. Which caused me to go crashing, sprawling to the floor. Running into the desk in the middle of the room.\n\nThe study.\n\nMany of the books were off the shelves. The carpet was torn. There were curtains on fire. It was the first time a saw a window as they burned.\n\n\"Camilia!\"\n\nI hear one of their voices shouting at me.\n\n\"Camilia!\" It came again. \"Help!\"\n\nI get to my feet and start working my hands along the desk. I didn't have to search far. The bookcase directly behind the chair had been swung open. \"Camilia!\" I wipe the blood from my eyebrow where it had split and step into the tunnel behind the secret passage.\n\nThe tunnel started off tall and wide, but as I kept walking in. It got smaller and smaller. I started having to hunch. Several times I decided to turn back. But their voices would echo through, calling for me. Asking for help. \"I'm coming!\"\n\n\"I can't hold on! Camilia! Please!\"\n\nThe twins cry for help bounced off the walls. I was finally on my hands and knees when I finally see two holes on either side. I'm afraid to look but then one of their voices came through clear as day. \"Camilia.\" It was right in my ear now. I turned to see the boy naked and huddling, hugging his knees at the back of his hole.\n\n\"Camilia! Help! I don't want to play this game anymore!\"\n\n\"Bobbie?\"\n\n\"Help me!\"\n\nI look into the hole, the walls are pressing on my back and there's dust going into my lungs. I can barely turn my shoulder. \"Crawl out!\"\n\n\"I can't!\"\n\n\"Crawl out! I'm right here.\" I take out my hand, \"Come on!\"\n\n\"Camilia!\" Came a voice from the other side.\n\nI turn my head and see Max in the other hole.\n\n\"No!\" Bobbie shouts at me. \"No!\"\n\n\"Hold on,\" I tell him. \"I'm going to get both of you out of here.\"\n\n\"No,\" Bobbie cries. \"It's all his fault. He's the one that did it. He's the one that wants to get out!\"\n\n\"Bobbie, what are you talking about.\"\n\n\"He's the one that put something in your drink so you'd fall asleep!\"\n\n\"He's lying!\" Max's voice rang through. \"It's him! I saw him. Always in father's study! Reading those books! Trying out those things he reads. Those curses. Those spells. It's why the shadow men are after him! Camilia! You have to believe me.\"\n\nI can hear Bobbie crying, \"Why are you lying! I don't want to play anymore,\" he screeches. \"I don't want to play!\" He sobs. \"You said you'd go away if I told you that I didn't want to play anymore.\"\n\nI don't know what made me do it. It sure wasn't the nauseating squealing tantrum of the boy which made me reach for him first. Maybe it was because I wanted him to shut up. I don't know but I plunged my arm up to my shoulder in to grab Bobbie's collar.\n\nInstantly I screamed and saw tiny spiders, short thin legs with round white backs crawl over my arms. I shook my arm in the hole, trying to smother them against the walls. That only caused these long brown flat slugs to fall. I saw one land on my hand. It had three distinct tendon-like lines running across its back and was about a half inch long. I pulled my arm out of the hole as I felt it pierce its flat head into the back of my thumb. I dropped my phone and heard it crack as the light splintered in the small, suffocating tunnel. But I didn't care as I looked at my hand and saw it burrowing its tiny spearhead below my skin. I grabbed at the wiggling tail still exposed and tried pulling it out.\n\nIt was like trying to pull our barbed wire. The spines on its body were facing me. So with each pull they dug deeper inside. I could see blood pooling under my skin, it was starting to turn purple as I tugged on its tail even harder. Until it gave. Popped right off and lay twitching in my hand. The head missing.\n\nI couldn't take it anymore. Really. I had tried my best. I shake my head. \"Bobbie. Bobbie. I'm sorry.\" But it didn't matter. When I looked over at Bobbie. He was covered in it. All of it. Even the spiders.\n\nMy jeans started shifting as I tried to wiggle myself out of there. But I hear Max's cry again. \"Camilia! Please!\"\n\n\"No,\" I whimpered. Shaking. I couldn't reach my hand in there again. But his voice was so scared. More scared than the pain I felt.\n\nI shot my arm inside. Bracing. Waiting for the pain. But there was none. Instead my hands grasped around his collar and I felt his cold clammy skin, and yanked him from the hole. He came without much struggle. His face covered in the soot of it all. \"Camilia,\" he cried. \"You picked me. You did it.\"\n\nI didn't have the heart to tell him that I almost didn't.\n\n\"Come on,\" I cried. \"We. Have. To go.\"\n\nThe two of us wiggled our way out of there, crawling on our hands and knees, and running when we could. We finally make it back into the study. And the fire is roaring now. One of the books fall from the shelves and when it hit the fire I swear it started screaming. There was so much smoke that I couldn't see. And the door was covered by the flames.\n\nI pointed to the window, the curtains on the floor in ashes. I kick the window. It didn't budge. I coughed. I kicked it again. The glass shook. I kicked it again and my foot went through. Pieces of the glass still hung in the frame, I use the tips of my fingers and pull them back. They fall to the floor cracking until there was a hole big enough for me to get through.\n\nI plunge my head out and take my first breath of fresh air. The moon was full and the sky was clear. I could hear sirens coming off in the distance. When both of my feet were on the roof. I reach my hand back and grab Max from the burning house. Together we run across the clay tiles and climb down the arched tree. The red fire truck comes screeching to a stop as several firemen help us down.\n\nOne of them pushes a breathing mask on me, and wraps me up. The neighbors are outside, and the police arrive. I see a familiar car come roaring down the street, screaming to a halt as Molly runs out. Her face is flustered and she's shouting. Pushing through the cops until she reaches me next to the ambulance.\n\n\"What happened,\" she literally screamed at me.\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" I tell her. \"There were these men.\" I take another breath. \"I couldn't do anything! B-but I saved Max! I saved him!\"\n\nShe looked at the house. It was blazing now in the cool night. \"Oh my god. Is Bobbie still in there?\" Molly starts to cry. \"My baby!\"\n\n\"Max. But Max.\" I cough. \"Max is okay!\"\n\nAnd she turns to me. I wasn't expecting her to be grateful. But there's anger on her face. \"You didn't save my son. But you saved our dog?\"\n\nI shake my head. \"No. Max. Your other son.\" I looked around but he was nowhere to be found.\n\n[s](https://www.reddit.com/r/CornerCornea/comments/u6rx8n/subscribe/)",

It isn't illegal, but its an act of malice. Malice by itself isn't illegal. You can be malicious without ever committing a crime. \n\nAlso, there's voluntary manslaughter which would be like driving drunk and there's involuntary manslaughter in which you did something that somehow caused someone to die, usually something like being determined to be the cause of a fatal car collision in which someone (but not you) died. \n\nIt gets a bit murkier with the different states and the DA and everything but that is the most simple version of it. ,",

    "postText": "\nDoes anyone know how to get out of a Starbucks contract?\n\nI just started my new job and I already want to quit. I REALLY want to quit. Because this shit isn\u2019t normal. I mean, is it? Do you guys have experience with this type of shit, or is it a normal thing when moving to the city? I\u2019m a small-town girl so I\u2019m not used to this. We didn\u2019t even have a Starbucks. Just a diner that had been broken into multiple times over the years. \n\nDo you know the bad feeling you get when something bad is going to happen, but you ignore it for the sake of staying sane? \n.Yeah.\n\nIt was one of those situations. \n\nBut I needed cash. I needed a job. College in the city is expensive, especially in my mid-twenties. Uber Eats every night and various subscriptions, such as Netflix and Spotify\u2014as well as basic living needs required cash. So, naturally, I looked for part-time jobs I could use to fill up my weekend and nights. When it came to job hunting, I was fairly lazy. So, the Starbucks job kinda came out of nowhere. \n\nI wasn\u2019t even looking for it. I was applying for a job in the local music store when it caught my eye. Someone to work late evenings and nights on weekdays and Saturdays. The job description didn\u2019t say much, just basic pay details and a full paragraph dedicated to talking about \u201cThe Starbucks Family\u201d. Skim reading it, I skipped to the APPLY NOW button and sent in my resume via email. Two hours. \n\nIt had taken two hours to get an email back offering a video interview the next day\u2014and a guaranteed job if I didn\u2019t screw it up. The video interview went well to my surprise. The woman who conducted it acted more like a friend, asking me what my favorite movies and TV shows were, and then going into detail about her own. \n\nIt didn\u2019t even feel like an interview. More like a chat. Which was exactly what the email said it was going to be. The interviewer was my mom\u2019s age, a total mom-like persona. She offered me iced tea before laughing and realizing we were on a video call. Her cat popped up halfway through her introducing several staff members by name. A large tabby whom she picked up and hugged to her chest. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do except repeatedly say, \u201cAww.\u201d and force an even bigger smile.\n\nThe woman who for some reason did not introduce herself finished the interview with a more formal and thorough talk-through of rules and regulations. Which went in one ear and out the other. I think I was too excited about the job as a whole. There\u2019s something almost mythical about working at Starbucks. I\u2019ve seen barista TikTok complaining about customer service and harping about in the back rooms. It looked fun. Plus, free drinks? I figured working at the famous coffee chain would at least have benefits and freebies. \n\nThe woman spoke to me for almost two hours about certain drinks, telling me I would be trained up, and then going on to explain the dos and don\u2019ts in a working environment. It was kind of patronizing, but I figured she had to be to remain professional. I tuned out when she started talking about a certain \u201cfeud\u201d they had with another store  down the road. The woman didn\u2019t go into detail, but her expression did darken significantly when she leaned closer to her screen and repeated the phrase, \u201cDo you understand me?\u201d I had to backtrack and try and go over what she had been saying, but I had found myself mesmerized by the gilded sword in the background. It hung from the back wall in all of its glory, and I was having a hard time trying to figure out why exactly a Starbucks manager had a sword hanging from her wall.\n\n\u201cSim?\u201d Inclining her head, the manager cleared her throat. \u201cDid you hear me?\u201d\n\nI did. Sort of. Under no circumstances must I visit or go near 2nd Street Starbucks. If I did there would be dire consequences and I would face losing my job, or worse.\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what \u201cor worse\u201d was, but from the way her expression twisted from funny-cat-lady to a potential employer, I didn\u2019t want to ask.\n\nYikes.\n\n\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d I said. \u201cI can\u2019t go near the 2nd Street store.\u201d I almost choked on a glass of water I had been slowly sipping throughout the interview. I had been sweating most of the day, dying in the intense June heat. It was a lot cooler in the evening in the city, but I was used to draining at least ten glasses a day. \u201cIs that real?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help asking, pointing to the sword behind her. \n\nI know you are supposed to maintain a certain professional persona and fa\u00e7ade during professional work interviews with potential managers. However, I really wanted to know if that ancient thing was real, it was driving me crazy. Because questions were arising in my head: How did she get it? Was it hers? Was it for some kind of aesthetic and feng-shui, or was there more to it? From the look on the interviewer\u2019s face, she seemed startled.\n\nWhipping her head around, her strict grey ponytail hitting the screen, she nodded before turning back to me, her gaze flicking down to what I presumed was a script she was reading off\u2014or maybe she was skimming through my printed-out resume. I wanted to ask her more about the elephant in the room, but she seemed satisfied with answering my question with a nod. She asked me more questions, mostly about my work ethic and if I enjoyed working in a team and independently, if I had any special requirements, and oddly\u2014if I had ever held a firearm. Now, that caused alarm bells. Along with the gilded sword dangling from this forty-something-year-old\u2019s lounge wall, I was definitely starting to question the exact nature of what I would be doing at this job. Serving coffee was an obvious one, though I was pretty sure Starbucks barista's didn\u2019t require military-style training. \n\nWhen I didn\u2019t know what to say, she seemed to back-pedal. \u201cOh, it\u2019s in case of a robbery.\u201d She said. But her expression stayed stoic. Speaking in the tone of being joking, but not being joking. \u201cIt is rare. However, it is a precaution we must take.\u201d Choosing her words carefully, the interviewer steepled her hands in front of her face, leaning her chin on her fingers. \u201cOur employees are given basic fire-arm training in the instance that one day we may face a difficult situation. Now, I am not saying it is inevitable, but due to certain behavior throughout the years, it is, of course, better to be safe than sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d I tried to smile. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d I paused, hoping my lack of ability to hold a gun wouldn\u2019t screw up my chances. \u201cBut I can learn?\u201d\n\n I said it like a question because it was a question. I was questioning myself why exactly I would take up my time learning to shoot a gun I most likely never would need. To my surprise though, the woman\u2019s smile brightened and she looked down at whatever she was writing.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cSim, I am very happy to hear that. We love employees who do their best to learn and thrive in our working environment,\u201d she paused and typed something on her laptop before her gaze found mine. \u201cI\u2019ll put you down for lessons on Friday mornings. How does that sound?\u201d Before I could answer her\u2014because I was starting to seriously question why she was so obsessed with training me to use a goddamn gun\u2014she was nodding to herself. \u201cI will put Jude in charge of you. I think he is working on Friday, so your induction and welcome can be completed in the morning\u2026\u201d\n\nShe trailed off into her own murmured conversation to herself before clearing her throat. I jumped. I didn\u2019t mean to jump, but her whole presence was putting me on edge. The lady had been nicer on the phone, and earlier on in the interview when she was grilling me on which Frozen character was my favorite.\n\n\u201cOkay!\u201d The interviewer gathered up her paperwork, beaming at me through the camera. \u201cCan you start tomorrow? Let\u2019s say\u2026\u201d her eyebrows furrowed together. \u201c5:30? I will not be there for the first hour due to certain obligations,\u201d she traced her lip with the tip of her index. \u201cHowever, I have four employees working the front desk, I\u2019m sure they will give you a warm welcome.\u201d I noticed something twitch on her lips. It was almost like she was trying to stop herself from laughing\u2014which was childish from a standpoint where I was the younger one, while she was the senior. She was supposed to be setting some kind of standard, and yet for some reason was more inclined in teasing me about workplace friendships, and apparently how \u201cclose\u201d my colleagues were. I wasn\u2019t stupid, I knew what friendship was like in the workplace. It\u2019s not \u201creal\u201d because you\u2019re all there to do a job, not making lifelong friendships.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to meeting them,\u201d I said when she snorted out a laugh that twisted up my gut.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" she responded. \"The team is very close, so don't take it personally if they're initially cautious. I'm confident that you'll all become great friends! Kai is a kind-hearted sweetheart, while Ana may seem standoffish initially, but she'll warm up to you once you get to know her. Jude, on the other hand, will be your guide during the orientation, so it's best to stay close to him. In fact, it's recommended to shadow him during your first few hours since he's our top performer! Frankly, Sim, I can hardly wait for you to meet them! They're a great group!\" This woman seemed to suddenly discover the use of expletives, or maybe she had noticed I visibly wanted to crawl into the ground. The way she was describing the other employees, I was expecting cartoon characters when I walked through the door. \n\n\u201cRight,\u201d I said. I was starting to regret applying. \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d\n\nShe ended the call with a bright smile, and her stupid cat walking on the keyboard, causing her to squeak out in horror. I shut my laptop, my cheeks burning. Well, that went\u2026? Well? Could I really say it went well when the manager had spent the last five minutes implying my work colleagues were going to hate me? Fuck. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to go. I trashed my application and deleted her number from my phone. But the morning after, however, I came to the quick realization through precious morning caffeine, that I needed cash. So, no matter how much I didn\u2019t want to go\u2014I had to.  So, I headed to classes and tried not to think about it. It was 5:34 when I stepped into the familiar glow of the famous store\u2014not before being stopped in the middle of a crowed by a girl wearing bright pink ray-bans and a scowl. \u201cDo you work there?\u201d she turned and pointed to the store.\n\nI shrugged. \u201cI guess.\u201d\n\nShe scoffed, slipping off her ray-bans and fixing me with a bitchy smile. \u201cYour funeral.\u201d\n\nNormally, in situations when strangers say odd things to me on the street, I just laugh it off. But this? This seemed personal.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nThe girl didn\u2019t say anything before turning and walking or rather running away.\n\nWell, that was weird.\n\nAfter that encounter, I was weighing the positives and negatives of taking up the job. The positives would be cash and something to occupy my mind away from classes, and the negatives were being stuck with insufferable colleagues and a manager who was the embodiment of unprofessional. The store was pretty empty when I stepped through automatic doors, reveling in the cooling fan blasting icy cold air in my face. A dark-haired college girl had her back to me, cleaning tables. But I noticed her stiffening up when I took a step forward. She straightened up like a cat going into territorial mode, before relaxing and holding a two-fingered hand up. \n\nThe store was empty so I had no idea who she was signaling to. It wasn\u2019t a greeting to me\u2014I had no idea what it was.  I was halfway to the counter before a guy popped up out of nowhere, mid-way through drying a cup with a washrag.  His hair was the first thing I noticed. Bright red. \n\nIn contrast to his pasty skin, this guy would definitely stand out in a crowd. He was my age or maybe a little older, mid twenties, with a wide smile and not much of anything else, kitted in a short-sleeved shirt, and a Starbucks apron over the top. \n\nI expected quirky cartoon-like weirdos and I got an average Joe. I wasn\u2019t complaining. \n\nInitially, I thought this guy was just another jock-like college guy. But looking closer, the friendliness in his eyes wasn\u2019t sincere, and his smile was strained. Keeping up a professional attitude, he regarded me with a smile, leaning across the counter. But his eyes kept flicking to the door in quick succession like he was waiting for a certain someone to come in. \u201cYou.\u201d He pointed at me, trailing his finger to the door, swiping hair from his face with his hand. The guy was bouncing on the heels of his toes, I noticed. He couldn\u2019t stand still, like a hyperactive child. \u201cYou\u2019re Sim, The newbie I\u2019m supposed to be training.\u201d\n\nI nodded, offering a nervous wave.\n\n\u201cJude.\u201d He introduced himself, though clearly distracted, his gaze flicking to and from the door. His facade was friendly enough, but very fake. It was the same smile I presumed he flashed at customers who complimented his looks. \u201cHey, Sim.\u201d \n\nInstead of holding out his hand for me to shake, he folded his arms across his chest. Jude cocked his head, drinking me in before his lips broke out into a beam. \n\n\"Shall we get started?\" \n\nJude started the tour, showing me the store itself, then the back, the storage room, the staff room, and bizarrely, a wooden door which he referred to as, \u201cThe Drink\u201d. I had no idea what that meant, but I made a mental note to steer away from it. \n\nThe backrooms of the store turned into a labyrinth. The place was covered in mold, peeling paint on the doors and old rugged floor tiles. Jude spoke way too fast like he was intentionally trying to confuse me. By the time I was struggling with my apron, he was turning on his heels with a brow raised.  \u201cYour hair is too long so you need to tie it up. You can shadow me this evening but don\u2019t get in my way. We have two twenty-minute breaks and during them, we are contractually obligated to go  down to the Second Street store and throw eggs at their windows\u2014ooh, and the girl you just met who didn\u2019t say a word? That\u2019s Ana. You will get used to her.\u201d His smile reached a level of fake I didn\u2019t think was possible. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you follow me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I managed to hiss out when Jude was leading me down a long, winding corridor that dipped into various rooms, out-of-order elevators, and the creepiest set of stairs I had ever seen leading into the pitch dark. I was still trying to register his words.\n\nJude twisted around with a frown. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He nodded at a passing blonde girl who shot me a smile, and hive-fived Jude before disappearing through a door.\n\n\u201cYou throw eggs at the store down the road?\u201d\n\nThe guy\u2019s lip twitched into the start of a smile. He turned around, quickening his pace. \u201cDid I say that? Obviously, I was joking.\u201d\n\nI stumbled after him, knocking into a dark-haired younger guy carrying a tray of cupcakes. He and Jude seemed to exchange words without speaking before Jude gestured to the stranger. Somehow, I figured out their telepathic conversation through eye movements and strained smiles, they weren\u2019t talking about me. \u201cThat\u2019s Kai,\u201d Jude said, pushing through the doors back to the main storefront. He took a customer\u2019s order, retaining that stupid smile. \u201cIf you need any help with making those annoying TikTok drinks that take a millennia to make and have probably broken several Geneva convention rules?\u201d He playfully knocked into me while preparing a drink, his hands knowing where everything was, preparing and serving a latte in a matter of minutes, \u201cKai is your guy! He runs our social media page and is practically a connoisseur on the next big trend. He'll deal with zoomers.\"\n\nI was slowly starting to ease my way into this job, and my colleagues seemed pretty cool. Jude actually helped me all the way through the evening, introducing his home life and how he grew up as he cleaned tables and conversed with the others\u2014always throwing me into their chatting so I didn\u2019t get left out. I ended up sorting through cookies and making price labels with Aurora, the perky blonde who high-fived Jude earlier. She spoke to me like we had been best friends for years, and that part of her charm made me instantly adore her. She was tiny for her age, but a menace when it came to her sharp tongue and language. I didn\u2019t think a tiny thing like her could swear like a goddamn sailor, but it was cute. Jude and Aurora had a sibling-type thing going on, though every time I caught Kai\u2019s eye, he was smirking. It seemed everyone knew they had a thing except them. \n\nI was actually having fun with the others, bobbing my head to the radio while serving a group of kids, when Jude, who was next to me, seemed to go rigid all of a sudden. His laughing smile carved into something else. I had never seen an expression change so fast. \n\nBut he wasn\u2019t the only one. Aurora, cleaning tables and giggling at Jude\u2019s joke, straightened up, her eyes flashing to the door. Kai\u2019s head snapped up from where he had been grinding coffee. Following their gaze, I found myself face-to-face with the manager who interviewed me. But unlike the night before, she was not smiling. The woman dropped her bag at the door before marching towards the counter. Jude leaned over; his expression apprehensive. \n\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\nHis eyes as well as his tone had darkened significantly. All of my colleagues had taken off these masks, these facades of joking smiles and bright eyes, and now I was seeing a glimmer of what they were hiding. What Jude had been looking for all evening, sneaking glances at the door.  I watched his gaze follow the manager as she paced back and forth, chewing her nails. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She finally said, lifting her head. Her lips were twisted. \u201cBut.\u201d She said, spitting each word, as she rounded the counter, helping herself to coffee. \u201cYou\u2019re going to pay a visit to them right now, and\u2026and sort this out once and for all.\u201d Her voice resembled that of a mother talking to her children. She was assertive to them, her eyes piercing. Do you understand me?\u201d The woman nodded at Jude. \u201cYou can go.\u201d Her eyes found mine. \u201cTake the new girl, she needs to be inducted.\u201d Finally, she turned to Ana, who was standing in the corner silently. \u201cYou are too. I need brains, and Jude is just brawn. Keep him on his toes, young lady.\"\n\nWith a hint of sarcasm in his tone, Jude uttered a brief \"Thanks,\" and then proceeded to take a coffee cup and a Sharpie. Swiftly, he scrawled some words on the side of the cup, before placing it inside a bag and plonking it in front of me. As Jude reached for his coat at the back, he put it on over his green Starbucks apron, creating a striking contrast with his denim blue sherpa. With his mop of red curls, this guy was in no way going to be as incognito as he thought. \"We'll manage the conversation,\u201d he said hurriedly, visibly excited. Jude seemed to lead the others in their expressions, his confidence and wit causing them to brighten up, adapting wide smiles. He shoved his hands in his pockets, \u201cAll you gotta do is hand them this, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that a good\u2026\u201d Kai drifted off on whatever he was about to say, ducking his head when Jude shot him a glare.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a perfect idea!\u201d The manager beamed at me. \u201cWhat a way to fully bring you into our family!\u201d  \n\nI took the coffee cup (the empty coffee cup) hesitantly. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gift!\u201d Jude said, moving towards the door in long strides. It was all too noticeable that this guy was practically vibrating with an energy I had never known. It was almost manic.  \u201cI want to let them know we appreciate them! Y\u2019know! Rival to rival.\u201d\n\nKai stepped in front of him on the way out.\n\n\u201cBe careful,\u201d he said in a low hum. Aurora joined him, but she wasn\u2019t speaking, her left-hand tugging at the waistband of her jeans.  \u201cKeep your head down when you go in because they\u2019ll be expecting you\u2014and they\u2019ll be expecting a retaliation.\u201d\n\n\u201cRelaaaaax, it\u2019s Cora! We used to date!\u201d he cocked his head. \"I think.\"\n\n\u201cI mean it. \"\n\nJude\u2019s gaze found mine for a moment before his smile grew. \u201cWell, we have enough eggs don\u2019t we?\u201d He grabbed my arm, pulling me along. Ana was already gone. I could see her figure already slinking down the street, bleeding into the shadow.\n\nWhen the two of us hit the cool night air and Jude quickened his pace into a power-walk, his eyes set forwards, jaw set, I figured I should ask what his deal was. If this guy was serious about vandalizing a rival Starbucks, and not just that, urged by his manager, then I had to say something. \n\nThe thought of ending up in jail being petty over a rival store made me feel nauseous.\n\n\u201cSo, what is this about?\u201d I asked, catapulting myself into a half-run to keep up with him. The guy had abnormally long legs, so he was halfway across the sidewalk while I was barely two steps in front. \u201cAren\u2019t you taking this a little too seriously?\u201d\n\nJude didn\u2019t reply, instead remarking on the sky being filled with stars. \n\n \u201cHey, Ana!\u201d He shouted. \u201cWait up!\u201d\n\nSecond Street Starbucks was like walking into a palace. I could tell why these guys were rivals. The place was a three-floored beast, a glass building made up of a Starbucks downstairs, a library, and a private apartment. I found myself mesmerized by the twinkling lights on the door, the mini water fountain through large windows showing an even bigger storefront with rich-looking wooden tables and reclining chairs. The store was closing. When we stepped in front of the door, there was a sign which clearly said CLOSED on the front. \n\nStill, though, Ana pushed her way through it, followed by Jude, pulling me along with him. Two employees were working, a guy with short blondish hair mopping the floors, and a girl standing at the counter, going through the register. The moment we stepped inside, the guy cleaning up stopped mopping from side to side, his fingers visibly tightening around the mop handle. \u201cHey there!\u201d \n\nWith one of his best fake smiles, Jude raised his arms in surrender. \u201cWe\u2019re from the Starbucks down the road. We come in peace, don\u2019t worry!\u201d He gestured to me. \n\n\u201cCan we talk to your manager?\u201d \n\nHe took a step, his lip twitching, eyes glinting, which caused a stir in the air. The girl at the counter stopped flicking through a wad of cash in her hand and delicately put it down, and the guy turned to face us with wary eyes. \n\nAs Jude took another stride forward, his movements resembled a dance, and I noticed he was having fun teasing them. His eyes sparkled with a childlike glee that was unexpected for a person in his twenties. \"Would you like to try our latest coffee recipe? It's like sipping on liquid sunshine.\" He nonchalantly brushed his jeans, and I half-expected him to pull out an egg. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d Jude took another step, and Ana situated herself behind the blonde boy, her expression blank. \u201cYou\u2019ve already tasted it, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nThe girl behind the counter finally stopped counting cash, delicately placing a wad back inside the register before leaning forward, an amused smirk curving on her lips. \u201cJude.\u201d Her voice was a low murmur. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would see you here so soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cCora.\u201d Jude\u2019s lips quirked. \u201cTrust me, I don\u2019t want to be. But hey, it's the boss's orders.\u201d\n\nShe inclined her head, her eyes drinking all of him in. The girl rested her fist on her chin. She was surveying him like a piece of meat. \u201cAnd you obey her?\u201d\n\nHis grin widened, and I saw his hand once again brush the front of his apron. \u201cLike a dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know her?\u201d I hissed out, grasping hold of the coffee cup in my hand.\n\n\u201cCora?\u201d Jude turned to me. \u201cOh yeah, we used to be the Romeo and Juliet of coffee shop rivalry \u2014 back when we were both newbies, and our store kidnapped me as a last resort. To keep the peace, I stayed.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m told, anyway.\u201d\n\nStarbucks lore was getting dark.\n\nThese guys had to be joking around.\n\nI took a step back, eager to head towards the door and be as far away as possible from what I was pretty sure was going to be a lot of eggs, and several arrests. \u201cYou worked here?\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe my mouth was still moving and forming words as I took slow steps back. Before Jude caught my arm.\n\n\u201cApparently.\u201d He said, dragging me back by his side. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give \u2018em\u2019 their gift?\u201d\n\nFuck.\n\nUnwrapping the bag and pulling out the cup, I nodded and took slow strides toward the counter, placing it down in front of her.\n\nCora frowned, before picking it up, her gaze going to the side.\n\n\u201cGo fuck yourself 2nd street bloodsuckers.\u201d She read out loud, her brow raising into her hairline.\n\nShit.\n\n\u201cI should probably go.\u201d I managed to say, backing away. \u201cI don\u2019t think is the job for me\u2014\u201d\n\nThe latter half of my words exploded in my head when something slammed into my ears, a physical force sending me to my knees. Initially, I didn\u2019t know what it was. It sounded like a nuclear bomb had gone off. When the ringing in my head subsided, I was aware I had my head buried in my knees, my hands clamped over my ears. \n\nBut when I tried to listen past the relentless shrill ringing in my skull, I heard them one after the other. Pop, pop, pop! Gunshots. The crack of each bullet ricocheted in my skull. It was a robbery, I thought dizzily. We were being robbed. No, Second Street was being robbed. When I lifted my head to try and find Jude and Ana to see if they were okay-- I expected them to be cowering like me, Jude, under the table, muffling yelling into his hand, and Ana, calmly pulling him to safety. But that wasn't what I saw. Instead, I must have been fucking imagining things. Jude had not moved from his spot-- and perfectly melded into his hand, was a gun. A gun he was holding like a pro, his hands wrapped around the butt, index teasing the trigger. \n\nHis trajectory was directly between Cora's eyes. Jude had not been the one who shot the gun. In fact, neither had Ana, who was still standing stiffly behind the blonde guy. \n\nIt was a girl behind the counter who had come out of nowhere wielding the type of gun I expected to see in movies. I noticed from his stance Jude had maybe stepped to the left and then the right to avoid being hit, but the way his demeanour was fully and completely relaxed sent shivers creeping down my spine. \"The deal is off, Cora,\" he murmured. \"You fuck with us, so we fuck with you.\" he lowered his gun slightly, his eyes darkening. \"Where's Ren? He came here to sniff you out, so where is he?\" \n\nCora seemed remarkably calm. She started to raise her hands, her lips forming the words, \"I don't know what you're talking about\" before she stopped, her body going limp. It took me a disorienting moment to realize Jude had taken the shot, followed by another, both landing right between her eyes. When Cora hit the ground, the whole world around me exploded. \n\nI was dragged to the ground by Jude, as he dived across the floor, pressing himself into the back of a table, twisting around, and taking out the barista who almost shot me in the face. There were five of them, all of them good shooters. Too good. Ana easily took out a blonde and brunette with her own magnum, followed by a bald guy who crashed through the counter which collapsed under him.\n\nJude fell into a manic shoot-out with a guy who would not give up, and after several attempts, re-loading, and attempting to finish him from the ground, my colleague got tired and stood up, dropped his gun, and leaped across the counter. I didn't know what to watch. Ana, who was destroying their coffee machine, or Jude, who snapped the boy's neck with a single twist of his fingers, before ripping out his eyes. He hauled the dead guy over his knees, grazing his teeth across the pasty flesh of the boy's neck, his eyes flickering. I wouldn\u2019t say they turned a different color, but there was something inhuman about them, a certain tint around his iris. \"Urgh.\" \n\nHe shoved the corpse away, jumping up. \"He reeks of it.\" Treading through broken glass and pooling red on the floor, my colleague grabbed a cup, downed it, and then spat it out. \u201cThat.\u201d He sputtered. \u201cIs the worst fucking thing I\u2019ve ever tasted.\u201d\n\nAna stepped in front of him, handing the boy his gun. \u201cWhen one of any clan is murdered for with no reason, there is an imbalance, and the coffee is tainted. We must restore the balance before this gets out of hand,\u201d she surprised me by speaking, with a tinge of an Aussie accent. The girl side-eyed me before shooting Jude a knowing look. \u201cDon\u2019t let her get in our way.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, aye, captain.\u201d He mocked a salute before nodding to me. \u201cAll right! Sim, you grab a sample. We\u2019ll go find the altar.\u201d\n\nSomething ice-cold slipped down my spine.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cCool it. It\u2019s more fun than it sounds,\u201d was all Jude responded with. \u201cGrab the samples.\u201d\n\nI was running on adrenaline, doing exactly what he said. I grabbed two coffee cups. \u201cWhat do we do now? We go home, right?\u201d\n\nHe swiped at his lips with a sound of disgust. \u201cAre you kidding? No, man. We get coffee which ain\u2019t tainted.\u201d\n\nAna took out two guards in the back before leading us both through a heavy metal door that led into tunnels, tunnels, illuminated by candlelight. \u201cYou just killed multiple people,\u201d I finally managed to choke out, following the two of them deeper into the dark. \u201cOver coffee.\u201d I couldn\u2019t resist a nervous laugh that spluttered into a cry. \u201cYou just murdered seven baristas over fucking coffee!\u201d I found myself backing away at points, scanning for a way out, an exit away from this fucking nightmare.\n\nJude turned to me, the glitter in his eyes reflected in the candlelight. \u201cOh, please,\u201d His voice echoed down the tunnel in a chuckle. \u201cDo you really think this is just about coffee?\u201d\n\nI didn't understand what he meant until we came to the end of the tunnel, which dipped into an alcove leading us into a large cave-like room. Drawing his gun, Jude scanned the dark. \"Anyone in here?\" He said, and Ana hit him. Silence answered, and I found myself paralyzed to the spot. I didn't know what to stare at first. The ten-foot-tall Starbucks Siren looming over us, illuminated in flickering orange candlelight, or the old swimming pool filled to the brim. When I took a step forward, my foot sunk into something soft, and I made the mistake of looking down. Bodies. \n\nI guessed that was \"The Drink\". \n\nI felt myself fall back, but Ana's warm arms were guiding me away from decomposing flesh which decapitated heads poisoned in a way that I could almost call ritualistic. There were bodies everywhere, all of them curled up or had died in a position of prayer. Jude crouched in front of a guy still in his Starbucks apron. His eyes had been cleanly plucked from his skull. Jude's expression was beautifully sombre in the candlelight. \"Fuck, dude,\" he whispered. \n\n\"Looks like they got you.\" \n\n\u201cWhich explains how they got their hands on our recipe.\u201d Ana pulled out her gun and clicked off the safety. The girl\u2019s eyes were suddenly sad, her lip wobbling. I had a hard time believing a girl who had taken out three baristas at point-blank range was crying. \n\n\"Through him.\"\n\n\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d I whispered. \"What the fuck are you doing in here?\u201d\n\nJude straightened up. Ana moved behind him, and I noticed her hands holding her gun were trembling. She raised her arm, pointing it at the back of his head. Jude didn't retaliate, only sending me a sickly smile. \"It used to be ours,\" he said. \"Until other stores started opening, and it became a fucking free-for-all.\" Jude sighed, rocking back and forth on his heel. Ana's trigger finger followed his movements. \"We have a peace treaty...\" Jude trailed off. \"Sorry. HAD a peace treaty.\" He nodded to his colleague. \"Second Street has always been obsessed with this particular blend we have that other stores don't.\" His lips curved. \"They're greedy, and thought they could fuck with us. First, they took our last manager. He was like a dad to us. Sliced him up and sent us his head.\" He gestured to his friend. \"And then they took Ren. They brought this shit upon themselves.\" \n\nAs he spoke, Jude dropped to his knees and closed his eyes, bowing his head in front of the Siren. Ana didn't move. \"Are you ready?\" \n\n\u201cAlways.\u201d\n\nI screamed, slamming my hand over my mouth when this time when Ana shot Jude point blank in the back of the head.  When his body crumpled to the ground, something inside me snapped in two, and I couldn\u2019t breathe suddenly. I thought the two were playing some kind of sick game before I caught unmistakable seeping black pooling across the alter. \n\nIn the blur of orange candlelight, it was almost a mesmerizing sight. \u201cShush!\u201d Ana sent me an annoyed look, before gathering his body in her arm. \u201cMake yourself useful and grab a bucket,\u201d she said, stumbling towards the pool. I watched her, my heart diving into my throat. When I didn\u2019t move, Ana hissed out and twisted around. \n\n\u201cDid you not hear me?!\u201d she yelled. \u201cGet a bucket and start collecting it!\u201d The girl gestured towards a large, rusted pipe looming over the pool, a stream of murky brown water leaking into the pool. When I started forwards, the girl shook her head. \u201cNot yet.\u201d She said, before heaving Jude\u2019s body and throwing him into the darkness. I heard the splash, but I didn\u2019t even see his body hit the surface. Part of me wanted to demand what the fuck she was doing, but I did what I was told, with trembling hands, grabbing a bucket and shuffling over to the pool edge. Ana hissed out again. \u201cI said not yet!\u201d Before I could speak, she held a finger to her lips. \u201cDo it now!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pool water?!\u201d I shrieked.\n\nShe raised a brow. \u201cYou think that\u2019s water?\u201d\n\nBefore I could coerce some kind of speech, I was interrupted by what felt like a sudden earthquake. The ground rumbled under our feet, and I hesitated before dropping the bucket into the water and scooping up as much as I could. I quickly realized it wasn\u2019t water. It was thick with the constancy of blood, coffee brown and yet sticky and warm like blood. \n\nAbove us, the pipe seemed to come to life, a brand new stream of murky brown solution coming down in a waterfall. I didn\u2019t think about the pieces of flesh floating on the surface, the decomposing heads I caught bobbing around, or the fact that I was dipping my hands in blood. Coffee and blood. My stomach was trying to projectile my lunch, but I swallowed it down. I took advantage, managing three buckets before Ana was grasping my shoulders and pulled me back. I didn\u2019t realize I was sobbing until she was handing me a handkerchief, and I was staring at her and it, like, \u201cWhat do you expect me to do with this?!\u201d\n\nStill in shock, I tried to get another bucket full before she dragged me from the pool edge. \u201cYou can stop now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have enough.\u201d\n\n\"Enough what?!\" \n\nI staggered back when the surface of the pool rippled. I don\u2019t know what I expected to come out.\n\nDead bodies?\n\nDecapitated heads?\n\nNot Jude, covered in the brown murky shit I had filled the buckets with. When he broke the surface, I almost threw one of the buckets at his head. Despite being covered in coffee and blood, his skin was oddly free of flaws. The guy was also really naked, which should have been a minor problem compared to what I was seeing, which was a real resurrection in front of a ten-foot statue of the Starbucks siren. Which was completely normal. \n\nBut I still found my cheeks heating up. Jude ran a hand through soaked curls sticking over his eyes, shaking them like a dog before pulling himself out. I couldn\u2019t help noticing there was no gunshot wound. It was almost as if his body was completely new. I took in abnormally grey-looking skin, like dead flesh, before averting my gaze. \u201cDid we do it?\u201d He gasped out, immediately covering himself. Once out of the pool, he knelt on the ground, sucking in breaths of air before seemingly realizing the state of himself. \n\n\u201cFuck. I didn\u2019t think this through.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did.\u201d Ana reached into the backpack she had brought, pulling out a shirt and jeans, reverting her eyes, and throwing him the bundle. \u201cGet dressed.\u201d She said, But there was a slight smirk on her lips. \u201cYes. I think we managed to appease them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSweet!\u201d Jude grinned, dressing quickly. He sucked the tips of his fingers. \u201cMmm.\u201d He nodded at Ana. \u201cThat tastes a lot better.\u201d\n\nHe gestured to her, and to my disgust, the girl delicately licked his fingers and nodded with her own smile. \u201cIt tastes like cherry blossom.\u201d\n\nHis eyes fell on me, and I saw that inhuman gleam in his eye\u2014that had been very much there before he was resurrected in a pool of coffee. His lip quirked. I could still see coffee-- or blood dripping in thick rivulets down his temples and cheek. \u201cShould we?\u201d\n\nJude turned to Ana. \u201cI mean while we\u2019re here, right? We can induct the newbie.\u201d\n\nImmediately, I knew what he was talking about. I stepped back, but he was following me, getting closer and closer until his breath was in my face, and I was teetering on the edge. I sensed something in his eyes, something I never expected from a man who knew exactly what he was doing. Envy. Another step, and I would be  falling into what I was sure was a pool full of decomposing bodies and resurrecting coffee. \u201cNot now,\u201d Ana murmured, and Jude snapped out of it, taking a step back. \n\n\u201cBuzzkill.\u201d He muttered. \n\nBut he did step away, allowing me to inch away from the pool.\n\n\u201cLater,\u201d Ana said. \u201cShe\u2019s shaken up. We can do it first thing tomorrow.\u201d\n\nTo my surprise, there were no cops at the scene at Second Street. Because there was no scene. \n\nThe store was back to normal, and I didn\u2019t have the energy to question why. When we returned, Aurora wrapped me into a hug I tried to get out of as quickly as possible, eager to get the fuck away from that place. But. I had to finish my shift. I had watched a man resurrected by coffee in a fucking Starbucks shrine, and yet somehow I had to keep making drinks until my shift ended. It was nearing closing time when the doors opened, and I found myself face-to-face with the girl from earlier. The one wearing the pink ray-bans.\n\nShe didn\u2019t say anything, but the blade of her knife grazing my gut told me everything I needed to know. With a knowing look when she slipped off her raybans, she pressed something into my hand before leaving, and I handed it to the manager, who opened it up, almost died laughing, and then threw it in the trash. \n\n\u201cYou work for psychopaths.\u201d I managed to get out, sidling in front of Jude while he was clocking out.\n\n\u201cAlso, didn\u2019t you\u2026 didn\u2019t you fucking die?\u201d\n\nJude didn\u2019t look up from his phone. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d His lip quirked. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out tomorrow during your induction.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 you work for these people!\u201d I lowered my voice. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not trying to get away?\u201d I gestured to Kai and Aurora standing by the door, the two of them locked in conversation. \u201cNone of you?\u201d\n\nJude frowned, and I caught the first hint of annoyance. I had only seen this guy smiling, so seeing him scowling was quite the change. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, do you\u2026 do you think I have a choice?\u201d \n\nHe surprised me with a laugh. \u201cMe? A choice? You really think I wake up every morning and WANT to do this shit?\u201d He got close, his breath in my ear. \u201cYou came here willingly. I didn\u2019t. In fact? I don\u2019t even remember coming here. My interview, my first day? Nothing. I don\u2019t even remember my time at Second Street.\u201d He threw a towel at me before I could coerce words. \u201cFinish clearing up, all right? I\u2019ll see you tomorrow for induction.\u201d\n\nThere was something cruel in his smile like he was waiting for whatever my induction had in store for me.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help myself. When everyone was gone, and I was tasked with locking up, I picked the discarded note out of the trash, smoothing it down.\n\n\u201cYou pieces of shit just declared war. Sleep with one eye open! \ud83d\ude0a\u201d\n\nCora xx.\u201d\n\n\u2026.\n\nI cut my finger with a knife this morning. When I sucked it and grabbed a band-aid, I tasted coffee. I went home and threw up coffee.\n\nI am peeing coffee.\n\nI showered 8 times and I still fucking smell of coffee. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to go to work tomorrow.\n\nEdit: There\u2019s been a break-in\u2014 and the manager wants me to come in early. Jude and Ana woke me up in the middle of the night to go over tactics. We are taking down Second Street during closing time.\n\nI guess I am going to work tomorrow.\n\nDoes anyone know how to use a gun?",

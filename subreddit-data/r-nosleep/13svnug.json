    "postText": "Back in April of 2013, I was a building and zoning inspector for Mon County, West Virginia. We were situated in an office up in Morgantown, where I usually worked with zoning permits and annual municipal building inspections. Not the most exciting job, but in my line of work, the best day on the job is a day where nothing happens. The fight against entropy is constant, and I had a sign hanging above my desk to remind me of such. It simply read \u2018everything breaks\u2019 in cursive, with a baby cherub in the corner.\n\nI remember being called up early one morning. There had been some sort of \u201cgeological event\u201d, and every inspector would be pulled off desk duty. We needed immediate building inspection in the area surrounding the outskirts of Greenbrier Valley. We were to coordinate our efforts with a central command up in Greene County. That morning, it seemed like everything was topsy turvy. The local news talked about an escaped murderer, and we were getting calls about a lake being drained. The local hospital desperately needed blood donations, but couldn\u2019t tell us why.\n\nOverall, something was up, and neither of us liked it. But we went along with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was assigned to a full inspection of a farm close to the epicenter; the Oak Valley Grain Farm.\n\nI was handed a dossier on the owner, employees, tax records, zoning permits, all that stuff. But I was practically pushed out the door before I got the chance to go through any of it. I\u2019d only finished half of my morning coffee when I found myself standing in the parking lot with a stern-looking man impatiently tapping his foot, waiting for me to get on my way. Given the way they were hurrying us, I got the impression that something terrible had happened. And yet, we were told to expect minimum damage; if any at all.\n\nStill, I had to remind myself of that eternal adage; everything breaks. That includes old barley farms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce I was out on the road, I took some time at a rest stop to go through the dossier. Mostly to get a feel for the place, and an idea of what to look out for.\n\nSo, the Oak Valley Grain Farm. A 75-acre area, originally established in 1882. The site was used both as a barley farm and a lumber storage yard, as most of the surrounding area was covered in oak trees. A few years into operation they expanded into having an off-site cooper and making their own barley malt for whiskey production. The original malting facility and accompanying barrel storage was still in use to this day.\n\nThe one problem I could spot was the historical buildings. Oak Valley had a series of prohibition-era buildings and underground storages, some of which were still being used. It was all legitimate, and more of a quirk than anything, but those areas had not been properly inspected for years. The landowner had been reluctant to allowing inspectors free reign, and Mon County hadn\u2019t seen the use in harassing the owner because of what could be, at most, considered a curiosity.\n\nThere was about a dozen employees, not counting irregular extra labor, the off-site cooper workshop, and seasonal farm-to-table event organizers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got there at about 10 am. Even from the parking lot I could see rolling hills of sprouting barley. Red birds were circling overhead; some kind of migrating species that had come home to roost. There was a constant low droning in the air, both from machinery and emerging spring insects. The air was dense with a smell of rain-drenched manure and fertile soil.\n\nI was greeted by one of the equipment operators, Elsie. A quiet middle-aged woman with a permanent squint on her face, like she was always blinded by the sun. I stifled my instinct to ask if she\u2019d had her vision checked in the past 6 months and settled with shaking her hand.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Oak Valley,\u201d she smiled. \u201cLacy will be out in a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs the landowner in?\u201d I asked. \u201cMister, uh\u2026 Kettleman? Anders Kettleman?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s not usually around that much,\u201d Elsie sighed. \u201cLacy is the, uh, de-facto boss lady. Runs the day-to-day operations. Anders is sort of a hands-off kind of guy ever since he got sciatica.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry to hear that,\u201d I nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s see the boss lady then.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nElsie showed me past the office and the silos. I was regretting not putting on more appropriate footwear, but most of my on-site inspections were usually municipal buildings. This was out of my comfort zone, and my feet would have to suffer for it. Manure-ridden water pressed into my socks.\n\nI met Lacy Kettleman outside of the workshop. She was busy trying to get a hold of someone to finish the repairs on her secondary combine. Lacy was in her early thirties but had already started to go gray. She held up a finger as we approached, finished her phone call, and turned to me with an eagerness to walk right through me.\n\nI\u2019d met a lot of people like Lacy Kettleman before, but there was something about her that put me off. There was something\u2026 there.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this about then?\u201d she asked, crossing her arms.\n\n\u201cA standard inspection, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said. \u201cOn account of the geological event in the area.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ain\u2019t had any geological events,\u201d she shrugged. \u201cSo your services aren\u2019t necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis here is a sizeable property,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sure you haven\u2019t had the time to check if everything is up to code. I can help you with that, then I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI appreciate that, but no. No need. Business as usual.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked over at Elsie, still hovering on the outskirts of the conversation. I clutched my dossier and resumed eye contact.\n\n\u201cMiss Kettleman. Do you mind explaining the problem with your combine harvester?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to get a hold of someone who does.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you wouldn\u2019t mind me having a look at your garage? Or better yet, the combine?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe combine doesn\u2019t constitute a building, sir. Not much use for a building inspector to look at that.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with the garage then.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile Lacy took off with her cellphone in hand, Elsie stayed by my side and guided me around the property. Turns out, Elsie was the one supposed to operate the second combine. Since it was out of commission, she didn\u2019t have much to do. She only had access to a few buildings, but it was enough to get me started.\n\nFirst off was the garage. While Lacy had said there\u2019d been no noticeable \u2018geological event\u2019, there was clear signs of disturbance. Several items had been knocked off the walls, and there were web-like cracks in the concrete floor. Nothing major, but enough for me to take note. There was no way Lacy was unaware of this. I took some pictures, made some notes, and wandered off to check the storage sheds.\n\nOver the next few hours, Elsie escorted me through the grounds. While most buildings were off-limits to her, and Lacy was nowhere to be found, I could still check the exterior. And while I didn\u2019t see anything obviously dangerous, there were clear signs of the area being disturbed. I could see the ground having shifted downhill from the storage sheds; entire rows of barley were bent.\n\nWhile waiting for Lacy to meet us by the offices, Elsie and I started wandering by the edge of the grounds. There were plenty of oak trees there, historically used for making their own barrels, and there were several old trails snaking through the undergrowth.\n\nWe were walking past a gazebo when I noticed an old well. Nothing out of the ordinary, at first sight, but I noticed something strange about it; algae.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took a closer look. Turns out the well was overflowing with water. Elsie seemed just as surprised as I was.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been dried out for years,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 definitely new.\u201d\n\nThere was a pulse to it. Gulps of water making tiny bumps in the surface tension. Algae and lily pads overflowing, making a green circle around the stonework. It had a strange smell to it, like salt and ammonia. Lake water?\n\nThis wasn\u2019t *normal*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe met up with Lacy, and I explained the various signs I\u2019d seen around the farm. Elsie quietly retreated, not wanting to be dragged into the conversation. Lacy just nodded along but didn\u2019t seem to react as I told her about the cracked concrete, the tilted rows of barley, or the various disturbed shelves. Seeing as there was clear signs of the area being affected, I told her I had to take a closer look at the structural integrity of the main buildings. And finally, there was the well.\n\nThis time, she reacted.\n\nShe had nodded and accepted everything up to that point. But all of a sudden, she was defending herself. She tried to explain that the well was backed up, and that they\u2019d had problem with water runoff in the past. There was nothing in the dossier about flooding, but Lacy was adamant. Also, arguing with her didn\u2019t do us any favors in gaining access to the farm interior.\n\n\u201cYou can stall all day, miss Kettleman,\u201d I reminded her. \u201cBut we\u2019re not done until I say so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not keen on government folks skulking about, sir,\u201d Lacy smiled. \u201cThis place has history.\u201d\n\nI told her I\u2019d be back the next day, and the day after that. As many days as it took for me to do my job. Lacy just grinned. She wouldn\u2019t make it easy for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took some time checking in with the other inspectors. Turns out I wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d noticed some strange abnormalities. A lot of bursting pipes, it seemed. The local high school was also a mess. Not to mention the elementary school over in Juniper. I was given no details about it, except that no one was allowed on the premises, and the entire school was sealed off; even for inspectors.\n\nBy comparison, my overflowing well was nothing. And still, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something about Lacy was off.\n\nI checked the dossier over and over that night, trying to make a game plan for the following day. I\u2019d take some extra time checking the irrigation and plumbing, and put an emphasis on the interior. Lacy would just have to comply.\n\nAnd yes, I would even check the old prohibition-era storages. She\u2019d just have to deal with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was up bright and early the following morning. I got to the Oak Valley Grain Farm at about 7 am, only to notice that it had been closed. Lacy had put up a sign on the door; \u201cClosed for Renovations\u201d. That was it. Maybe she figured we wouldn\u2019t have to conduct any inspections if there was no current business being conducted, but that\u2019s not how things work. I tried calling her, but got no response. I sent her a single text; she was either to open up the facility for inspection, or I had to take legal action. Shortly afterwards, she assured me she\u2019d be there.\n\nOne hour and thirty minutes later, Lacy came out of the main office building. Apparently, she\u2019d been there all along. Strange though, she had no car in the parking lot. She was out of her work clothes, having just slapped on a gray hoodie and a pair of torn jeans. She looked exhausted.\n\n\u201cPleasant morning?\u201d I asked.\n\nI cursed myself for forgetting to bring appropriate footwear; again. Lacy didn\u2019t respond; she just wrapped her arms around herself and kept her head down. Something was wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe headed into the main office. Nothing out of the ordinary. No damage, no problem with the plumbing. All in all, it seemed perfectly fine. I couldn\u2019t figure out why she was so reluctant to show it to me. Then I double-checked the dossier. Of course, there was the prohibition-era cellar.\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d I sighed. \u201cTime to head underground.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that absolutely necessary?\u201d Lacy asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess, we don\u2019t use it for much.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been putting off an inspection for a long time, miss Kettleman. Given the circumstances, I can\u2019t really motive putting it off any further.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cellar,\u201d she shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s not much that can go wrong with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything breaks, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe door to the cellar was so small I had to move sideways to fit. How they moved contraband whiskey through there back in the day was a mystery to me. Still, I was there to check for damages; not sightseeing.\n\nWe came down to a larger open space, with an eight-foot drop into a storage area. It was about 16 by 20 feet in total. There was an old steel ladder leading down, with two open paths leading deeper down. A set of flashlights were hanging on the wall, so I brought one with me. As I put my hand on the first rung on the ladder, I noticed Lacy\u2019s expression change. While she\u2019d been angry or frustrated before, she looked almost apologetic now.\n\n\u201cThis will complicate things,\u201d she sighed. \u201cBut we\u2019ll\u2026 work it out, somehow.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure thing. Now, the supports seem fine,\u201d I said, climbing down. \u201cBut there might be damage further in.\u201d\n\nI stepped away from the ladder, taking in the smell of salt water and ammonia.\n\nThe moment I did, Lacy *pulled the ladder up*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis caught me completely by surprise. I hadn\u2019t even considered that an option. The ladder just rattled away, and I was left down there. It was so sudden that I didn\u2019t know what to say. I just threw my arms out in a confused shrug.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike hell you are, put the ladder back!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling the police.\u201d\n\nThere was no coverage. We were too far underground.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was slowly realizing that she was going to leave me down there. All I had was this flimsy flashlight and a couple of hours of battery on my phone. Lacy remained up there, holding the ladder.\n\nI could feel my heart pounding; drowning out the background noises in my mind. I was growing short of breath, struggling to exhale. I\u2019ve never been claustrophobic, but this was something else. Something darker. A real, actual threat to my life.\n\n\u201cThey came to me, looking for shelter,\u201d Lacy said. \u201cThey speak, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey said you were coming, and I want to hear what else they have to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep me here!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just need time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you-\u201c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a sound coming from one of the side corridors.\n\nMy heart shrunk and floated up into my throat. I held my breath, trying to hear the sound through my hammering pulse. I could feel my fingertips growing cold.\n\nThere was a strange hissing sound, like someone trying to start a dying motor. Lacy stood at attention, listening intently.\n\nSomething was down there with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWe came to their home,\u201d Lacy whispered. \u201cNow they\u2019re coming to ours.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI backed into the corner of the room, only now noticing the thin layer of water covering the dirt floor. I turned off the flashlight and listened, trying to calm myself enough to not go into hyperventilation.\n\nSomething was coming this way. Footsteps.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d Lacy whispered. \u201cWill you speak to me?\u201d\n\nThe footsteps stopped. There was another hissing noise, rattling me. It felt like someone was playing fiddle with my nerves.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Lacy. \u201cHe\u2019s all yours.\u201d\n\nI could hear her stand up to leave; taking the ladder with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe footsteps came closer.\n\nCloser.\n\nI tried to move, but I made too much noise. The footsteps stopped for a moment.\n\nI thought I\u2019d scared it. Frightened it; made it hesitant.\n\nThen it burst into a sprint.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned my flashlight back on and ran down the corridor on the opposite side of the room. I tore down all kinds of debris as I went; planks, old barrels, empty jars. Whatever I could get my hands on. I glanced back, catching a pair of eyes coming out of the dark. A wide, shark-like mouth.\n\nA side room; some kind of meeting area. I jumped over a table, knocked it down, and backed away. Seconds later, the table was smashed in two. Fragments of wood scattered across the room, making my nose itch.\n\nBut the thing stopped. It stayed just outside my vision; on the edge of the flashlight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt hissed again, sending another shiver up my spine. But somewhere in that vibration, I heard something. It wasn\u2019t a word, but a collection of scrambled thoughts. Much like a word square; a jumble of information that you had to find your own meaning in. But rest assured; there was meaning.\n\nFear. Anger. Hunger.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what do you want from me?\u201d I asked.\n\nMy flashlight flickered, and the thing twitched. It was ready to strike, like a coiled snake.\n\nIt hissed in response.\n\n*Hunger. Hunger. Sadness.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI retreated into the corner of the room, accidentally knocking over a shelf of empty prohibition-era bottles. I could see the reflection of those dark eyes shining back at me, as they patrolled back and forth; looking for an opening.\n\nAnother hiss.\n\n*A pleading. A promise. A bone-chilling coldness.*\n\nIt was starting to sound like language. An old, primal language. A language that could summarize so much, with so little.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI fumbled with my hands, looking for the biggest bottle I could find. Finally, I got a hold of an old wine bottle. Waiting for the creature to hiss again, I readied the bottle for a throw.\n\nAs soon as I felt that tingle in my spine, I knew I was about to hear it. I stood up, lowered my flashlight, and threw as hard as I could.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a thick, fleshy thunk.\n\nThe hissing stopped, and I could see the dark eyes rise another two feet into the air. The thing had been hunched over; now it was taller than the tunnel itself. It flinched, spitting out another word. With that single word, a series of impressions washed over me.\n\n*Cold, water-filled tunnels. The crunch of raw fishbone in my mouth.*\n\n*Dying men in black togas, giving praise to a drowned God; hoping against hope to see another dawn.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn\u2019t notice I\u2019d been zoning out. I\u2019d leaned the flashlight downwards, and I could see those dark orbs inching closer. I backed up against the wall and inched away, effectively sidestepping my way around the room. The creature followed my movements, matching them. I ended up with my back against the corridor; so I turned to run.\n\nIt was right behind me, and it was fast. I just kept going, hearing the hissing coming closer.\n\n*Hunger. Joy. Hunger. Warmth.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went straight through the storage room and into the opposing corridor. It twisted and turned, only to spit me out into a room with a slightly lower floor. I fell forward haphazardly, spraining my ankle and dropping the flashlight.\n\nIn an instant, the flashlight flickered, and died.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI fumbled through my pockets, bringing out my phone. My hands were shaking so bad I couldn\u2019t unlock the screen. On the third try, I got it open, and the flashlight app came on.\n\nThis time, the creature was almost upon me. It screeched and retreated; blinded.\n\nIt had too many limbs. Too many\u2026 everything.\n\n*Anger. Anger. Desperation.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeaving my phone on, I tried to get back on my feet.\n\nI couldn\u2019t. My foot was too badly sprained. I could jump around a bit, at most, but I was no match for whatever was out there. Instead, I looked around the side-room I was in.\n\nIt must\u2019ve been a kind of armory. There were broken wooden crates and used-up shotgun shells littering the floor. A used-up old oil lamp on the wall.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t come in here,\u201d I said out loud. \u201cI\u2019m not dying here.\u201d\n\nHissing. A strange word hidden in the fog of my mind.\n\n*A man handing a venomous snake to a golden woman.*\n\n*Rolling hills of endless crucified men.*\n\n*A certainty of a violent death, the wailing song of the doomed.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt didn\u2019t understand my fear. I was already doomed, there was no point in fighting it. To the creature in the dark, time was an insignificant factor.\n\nI realized I\u2019d been sitting there listening to it hiss to me for at least ten minutes. My cellphone was running hot, and the water level had risen by about an inch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, the water level! There had to be water coming from somewhere!\n\nEverything. Breaks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was a miracle that I hadn\u2019t seen it before. There was an overturned table in the middle of the room. That\u2019s what I\u2019d sprained my ankle on. Kicking it with my good foot, I revealed a crack in the dirt floor from which water came bubbling up. A few lily pads plopped up, their coloration a strange blue; like a sad sunflower.\n\nThe crack in the floor might\u2019ve been the remains of a well, or the start of a tunnel going deeper underground. Either way, I had to take a chance. There was no telling how deep it went. I could drown, but I could also find my way out.\n\nI left my cellphone with the light shining on the entrance, holding the creature back.\n\nWith a final screech, it conveyed a final picture;\n\n*Webbed fingers, deep underground.*\n\n*Tearing a human body to pieces.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took the plunge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI crawled my way forward; inch by inch. The wet dirt barely gave me any grip, and the water stung my eyes. My nails hurt from all the debris trying to dig into my fingers. I could feel my chest tightening; cramping.\n\nA fork in the path. I went left.\n\nA current. A stream. Brushing something slimy out of my face.\n\nA tilt upwards.\n\nCold.\n\nCan\u2019t feel my arms.\n\n*Hunger. Reaching.* ***Hunger****.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI broke through the surface. I was in the stone well.\n\nI threw myself out, gasping for air, looking back only to see something just under the surface of the overflowing well.\n\nTwo black orbs retreated into the dark, sinking back into the unfathomable depths.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made my way to the nearest road and flagged down the first car I could see. Lacy Kettleman was brought in for questioning, but that\u2019s all I know. There was no trial. No debriefing. I just told about my experience to a stern-looking man in a suit, and that was that. I was told to sign an NDA lasting a minimum of 10 years. It ended recently, and I\u2019ve been waiting to tell my story.\n\nAnders Kettleman eventually took back control of the Oak Valley Grain Farm. As far as I know, Lacy never went to jail. Something must\u2019ve happened though; she was missing for the better part of a decade.\n\nMaybe she had something they wanted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think that whatever I met in Oak Valley had something to do with the crisis of 2013. There were a lot of rumors coming out of that area, and I\u2019m sure at least some of them originated with whatever Lacy had invited to stay in her cellar. There haven\u2019t been many others coming forward about their experience of that incident, but I know they\u2019re out there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe they\u2019re hoping we\u2019ve all moved on or forgotten. Maybe they\u2019ve been safe behind their contracts and fear tactics. But I\u2019d like to remind them, as much as I remind myself every day;\n\nEverything.\n\nBreaks.",

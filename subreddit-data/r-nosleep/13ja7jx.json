    "postText": "I woke up this [last](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ib2es/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_my_first/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) morning to my phone ringing. Elijah Carter was calling at seven a.m. for some reason. To be frank, I hadn't expected him to ever outright seek contact with me again after he'd seen me \"go alien\" back in the cave. But there he was, his name brightly illuminating my screen as I swiped to accept.\n\n\"Good morning?\" I cawed, wiping a trail of sleep-slobber from my chin. \n\n*\"Great, you're up. Listen, I'm not going to go into my *many* misgivings about what you are\u2014Nettie's told me everything. And yes, it's weird. But we both want to earn our bread, and I have a job for us.\"* He spoke quickly and sternly, not stumbling over a single word. \n\n\"A job?\" I repeated.\n\n*\"Yes; it'll be a one-time thing, and it's honestly a bit dubious, which is why I think it'd be good to have you by my side for it. I didn't get this offer through my firm, some stranger reached out to me via email and asked if I would be interested. I normally wouldn't even consider going into anything as shady as that, but they *are* paying eight thousand dollars for just this one night, so let's just say I'm tempted.\"*\n\n\"What's it about?\"\n\n*\"There's this abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town that apparently has a container inside. They need one or two people to stand guard for it tonight. Ten p.m. to six in the morning. After that, they'll take it off our hands again and that's it.\"*\n\n\"Who are they?\"\n\n*\"That's the other sketchy part\u2014I got no idea. The guy who contacted me just went by John Doe, which is most certainly not his real name, and he referred to his group as \"The Collective\", Lord knows what that's about. But as far as I'm concerned, that's none of our business. We just go there, hang out in the warehouse for eight hours and then go splitsies on the money.\"*\n\n\"And it's supposed to be tonight?\"\n\n*\"Yes, exactly. I only got the mail, like, fifteen minutes ago. The way I see it, the only thing that's at stake are our lives and those four thousand bucks for either one of us sound like fast and easy money. I'll be packing heat, and you\u2026 well, you'll be packing those giant octopus-arms. Can I count you in?\"*\n\n\"Pick me up at half past seven.\"\n\nEli chuckled, relief audible in his voice. *\"Ma'am, yes, ma'am. See you then.\"* \n\nI went about my usual routine; I browsed the sites for work prospects, did my laundry, cleaned up the apartment a little and finally took a shower before dressing up and heading over to the diner. The onslaught of lunchtime customers had thankfully passed, and there were only three people occupying a single booth in one of the corners. I recognized one of the long-time waitresses, standing behind the counter cleaning the coffee maker, but my waiter wasn't anywhere to be seen. \n\n\"Hey Rhonda,\" I greeted the lady handling the kitchen appliance. \n\n\"Oh, hi! Let me guess, coconut water?\"\n\n\"I'm here because I'm looking for your coworker,\" I told her, falling silent upon considering her suggestion. \"But yes.\"\n\nShe laughed and briefly abandoned her task to pour me a glass. \"So, you were saying?\" \n\n\"I need to talk to\u2026\" I paused. No name. I didn't know his name. \"To the man who works here. Not too tall, slender, shiny golden hair, extremely attractive?\"\n\n\"Attractive?\"\n\nI hid my face behind my glass.\n\nRhonda laughed again, her dark eyes glinting. \"Not the most objective description, but from the hair part, I'm guessing you mean Frank.\"\n\n*Frank.*\n\n\"He went to take five, so try the back. You can go through the kitchen, I don't mind.\"\n\nI thanked her, paid up and marched right past her out the back door. The small alley behind the diner was plain and nondescript, safe for a dumpster and a tacky dark green bench which the waiter was sitting on. His head was tipped back and his eyes closed, the hint of a smile on his lips as he seemed to be soaking up the sunlight. A pink chewing gum bubble had formed at the tip of his lips, and it popped when I cleared my throat.\n\n\"Did you follow me home?\" I asked sharply.\n\nHe whirled around, fixing me with wide eyes. I steeled my will, trying not to draw the comparison between him and a startled fawn. \n\n\"At which point did you find out where I live?\" I demanded, firmly planting my feet on the ground before him. \n\nHis response came faster than anticipated. \"A year ago. A couple days after we first spoke.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I know how this looks, but I promise I had no\u2026 untoward intentions. Never,\" he said, his tone somber and earnest.\n\n\"Why?\" I repeated.\n\nHe sighed and his shoulders sagged. \"I knew right away that you weren't a normal person, and I got insanely curious. I followed you because I wanted to talk to you. But then I just kept having these thoughts, like, *what if she's dangerous? What if she's a demon or something? What if she slits you open and drinks your blood?* And then I couldn't bring myself to stop you and ended up simply leaving after you went inside.\"\n\nI straightened up, my frown lifting ever so slightly. \n\n\"I'm sorry,\" the waiter said. \"I promise I don't mean you any harm, I was just being stupid.\"\n\n\"Accepted,\" I muttered, appeased as I sat down beside him. \"You overhear a lot of things on your job, don't you? Just how much do you know about me?\"\n\n\"Not as much as I'd like to.\"\n\n\"I don't know the first thing about you. Except that your name is Frank, apparently. Rhonda said so.\"\n\n\"And whose fault is that? You could have asked me anytime.\" He turned to face me fully. \"My name is Frank Preston. Frank sounds far too severe for me, so I go by Frankie or Fran, or whatever other nicknames the ladies here at the diner come up with. I have absolutely no one, no family, no friends, aside from my coworkers. There, now you know some stuff.\"\n\nFor a moment, I wordlessly held his gaze. \"And you're not human either?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nSilence for another beat. \"Do you want to come over tomorrow and watch TV?\" I asked.\n\nHe let out a barely audible gasp, then smiled as he nodded. \"I'd love to. And I swear I wasn't trying to be stalker-y.\"\n\nI cocked my head. \"Granted, I have been showing up at your workplace very frequently because I wanted to see you.\"\n\nA small grin began to form on his face. \"So are you saying that we're both bad with boundaries or that we simply gravitate towards each other?\"\n\nI did not know how to answer that, so I turned to leave. \"See you tomorrow, Frankie.\"\n\n\"Bye, sunshine.\"\n\nBack home, I made something to eat and then put on something practical and comfortable in anticipation of a long night. Eli came to pick me up in his station wagon at seven twenty-five. I sank into the seat beside him and he gave me a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. \"Ready for whatever this is gonna be?\" he asked, facing the road as he started driving. \n\n\"I suppose.\"\n\n\"How was your day?\" \n\n\"Uneventful. Yours?\"\n\n\"The same.\"\n\nThankfully, we didn't have to make any more stiff smalltalk as we soon pulled up outside of the warehouse. The building itself was intact and stable, but it hadn't been used for any enterprises that I knew of in a long time. The large structure was bathed in nightly darkness, the pale moon looming overhead. Upon exiting the car, we were greeted by a person walking towards us in large strides. They were tall, thin and gangly, dressed in sporty attire with a hood pulled up to obscure their face. It was only when they got closer that I could make out the nondescript, plain black mask that hid their features. Eli seemed to notice at the same moment, judging from the sharp breath I heard him suck in through his teeth. \n\n\"Are you Mr Carter?\" the stranger inquired in a voice that I couldn't quite place, coming to a halt in front of us. \n\nElijah nodded.\n\n\"Good; you're right on time.\" The masked person extended a gloved hand to drop a key into Eli's open palm. \"Rules are simple. Get in there, make sure nobody else does and stay the fuck away from the container. Don't even think about looking in and make sure it stays shut. I don't need to explain myself to you; just do it. I'll be back in the morning. Until then.\"\n\nThey threw us a sharp nod before turning on their heel and marching off to a motorcycle standing beneath the trees in the distance, half obstructed from view. Elijah and I traded bewildered glances before he eventually shrugged and began leading me up to the small side door to the warehouse. We slipped inside, I fumbled for and finally found the lamp switch. The hall was instantly illuminated by a flash of cold light. We both squinted, blinking against the brightness. There was, indeed, a man-sized metal cube right there in the center of the large room. It was dark red, the color reminding me of a stop sign, and something about it immediately struck me as threatening. \n\n\"Oh, I can just *tell* something's off about this whole deal,\" Eli mumbled.\n\n\"So getting vague job offers watching abandoned places is par for the course for you?\" I asked.\n\n\"Good point.\"\n\n\"What do we do now?\"\n\n\"I stay here to watch the door and you go over there and stand by those big windows. I'm not gonna lie to you, I think this is just a nonsensical stunt for some nutjob; it doesn't mean anything. So don't worry too much.\" \n\n\"What do you think is in that box?\"\n\nEli shrugged. \"None of our business, and we promised not to check. Rich folks get up to weird shit all the time. Maybe it's a sedated elephant and someone's gonna come pick it up to keep as an illegal exotic pet.\"\n\n\"No, it can't be,\" I argued. \"It's too small for an elephant.\"\n\nElijah grunted in amusement. \"Well, a tiger then, or a lion.\"\n\n\"And you don't have any moral reservations?\" \n\n\"For that kinda money, would you? Here's something to remember, Evangeline; bad things are going to happen all the time with or without you, so you might as well, if you get something out of it.\"\n\n\"That is a depressing worldview. Nettie would disapprove.\"\n\nHe laughed bitterly. \"Most likely. Now stop annoying me.\"\n\nThere was definitely something about being in an empty warehouse after dark. The strange, almost unearthly silence weighed down on everything, only broken by the intermediate groans of the settling building. The pale glow falling in from outside painted shivering white lines on the rough floor. I walked over to the windows to gaze out into the moonlit night. The shadowy treetops were trembling, swayed by the breeze wafting over from the seaside. After a while, I took out my phone and started typing away at another journal entry. When I got bored by that, I texted Nettie and then Kit. The former was off to bed and the latter didn't respond. I hadn't properly talked to my roommate in over two days at that point. I was torn from my reverie by a loud rattling noise that undoubtedly came from within the container. Perking up, I circled it to come face to face with Eli, whose confused expression mirrored my own. \n\n\"Something just moved in there,\" he stated the obvious, looking almost like he wanted me to soothingly contradict him.\n\n\"Your lion-theory might not have been all that far off.\"\n\nHe walked up to the cube and pressed his ear against the wall, frowning when he didn't seem to hear anything else. \"There's no chance we both imagined that, is there?\" he thought aloud, eyeing me with visible skepticism. \n\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\n\"Hm. Okay listen, what I said before was dumb; you gotta be merciful\u2014*always* be merciful. If we've actually stumbled into something highly illegal here, we need to extricate ourselves.\" He straightened up, crossing his arms. \"Now here's the thing. If we walk out on this freak's assignment, there's a good chance we'll not only lose the money but end up facing the consequences. I'm not sure if I wanna know to what extent our *employer* can hold a grudge.\"\n\n\"I suppose that depends on how important this is,\" I supplied. \"So where do you draw the line? What has to be in that box for you to wanna leave?\"\n\n\"People,\" he answered without missing a beat. \n\nI shrugged, then drew closer to pound against the container wall with my fist. \"Hello?\" I shouted.\n\nNo response. Eli and I exchanged uncertain looks. And then, all of a sudden, a bang. The metallic sound was so loud and powerful that it sent the entire cube shaking and the floor beneath our feet vibrating. Elijah jumped and my eyes flew wide open. We slowly turned our heads to stare at the container. There was a sizable, outward-facing dent in its wall. Whatever was locked inside had bashed against the side of its prison with such force that the sturdy material had bent under its might. My throat had gone bone dry and for a moment, my lips felt too numb to form any words. Elijah was regarding the warped crate in abject terror, slowly shaking his head, the movement barely perceptible.\n\n\"Now I'm certain there aren't any people in there,\" I offered when I regained my ability to speak.\n\n\"Oh, fuck\u2026\" Eli mumbled, palming his forehead. \"What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck\u2026 What even is this? What the hell is going on lately? I just can't have two normal days in a row anymore, can I?\"\n\n\"I agree that this is very concerning, but didn't we go into this expecting something strange?\"\n\n\"Yes, but not *that* strange! This is more ghost crap, isn't it?\" He looked at me like he expected me to go ahead and explain what was in that box; like I was an expert by association.\n\n\"Elijah, I have no idea what's happening here,\" I said, fixing him with a firm stare. \"So are we going to do this or walk out?\"\n\nHe let out a deep, raspy sigh, rolling his lips together. \"What do you want to do?\" he then asked quietly, in a tone I wasn't used to from him.\n\n\"Let's stay. Just leave it alone. Whatever's in there doesn't need to concern us. As long as we make it to the morning, we can collect our money and be done with this.\"\n\n\"Right,\" he muttered, his face softening. \"We can do this.\"\n\nWe returned to where we'd been lounging around earlier. Midnight came and went and before long, I found myself getting a tad sleepy. I had taken a small nap back at home, but my usual schedule was definitely beginning to catch up with me. The lights had long since failed us, leaving the warehouse in relative darkness once more. I started busying my feet by repeatedly circling the container. Elijah didn't seem to be affected by the monotony of it all; whenever I passed him, I'd find him staring into the distance, deep in thought and yet attentive enough to acknowledge me with a small flick of the head each time.\n\nOn my hundredth round or so, I became abruptly aware that one spot on the ground had become\u2026 *slippery*. I seemed to have stepped right into the puddle, too, because when I moved aside, I found that the motion appeared to be hindered by a sticky substance coating the sole of my shoe. I took out my phone and pointed its flashlight at the floor, only to physically recoil when I laid eyes on it. My chest instantly constricted and I felt cold sweat break out on my forehead. I called out for Eli, not once averting my gaze. The tall man was by my side in a heartbeat. He let out a shaky growl when he spotted the source of my distress. \n\nThere was something leaking out from the container, something thick and deeply red. Tiny bits of gooey mass swam in the quickly forming pool and I gagged when the metallic, visceral smell permeated my senses. \n\n\"This can't be happening,\" Elijah mumbled.\n\n\"It's blood, isn't it?\" I whispered back.\n\n\"Yeah, but I mean it, this\u2014this can't be happening. How? We didn't hear a thing, and we were here this entire time! There couldn't have been much of anything going on in there, a-and this much\u2026 You'd have to kill, like, an ox or something,\" he stammered. \"This isn't possible, is it? Well, obviously it is, but\u2026\" He pressed his palm to his forehead, furiously rubbing the creases between his brows. \"I feel like I'm going insane.\"\n\nAs soon as those words left his lips, another bang sounded out from within the container, the material groaning and bending outward. I let out a sharp scream, the noise having sent my heart racing. My voice was quickly drowned out by the cacophony of screaming as it twisted and scraped upon the stone floor, squealing demonically as I heard the container's hinges burst and finally gave way. Elijah grabbed me and basically hurled me aside before flinging himself into the corner, shielding his head with his arms. Like him, I flattened myself against the ground, trying to protect my body from the scraps of metal sailing through the air as the cube's doors exploded open. \n\nExcept that burst never came. \n\nThe warehouse was lying in complete silence once again.\n\nI slowly pushed myself up, stealing a glance at the container. It was whole. There were absolutely no dents, not even the one from before, no pools of blood and viscera, no\u2026 *anything.* It appeared to be in the very same state as it had been when we'd gotten here. I staggered to my feet. My ears were still ringing when I slowly made my way around the box. Nothing. \n\nElijah Carter was sobbing on the ground. I knelt down beside him, my hand hovering over his back before quickly deciding not to touch him. I crawled a few feet away from him, eyeing him nervously. He wasn't reacting. I softly said his name, trying to emulate the way Nettie used to calm me down after every failed attempt to introduce me to new elements of human life. He was lying curled up, downward facing, his shoulders trembling. He finally turned back around, facing me with wild eyes. His chest was heaving. I shrunk back to give him even more space. \n\n\"You're okay,\" I told him in as gentle a voice as I could muster. \"We're both okay. Can you hear me?\"\n\nHe still wasn't looking at me, but he moved his head to nod. \n\n\"Do you know where we are?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure anymore.\" His voice came out cracked and feeble. He suddenly looked so small, staring up at the ceiling so high above him, his powerful frame limp on the ground.\n\n\"We're in the warehouse. We're safe. Nothing exploded. It tricked us.\"\n\n\"What tricked us?\"\n\n\"Whatever is in that big box.\"\n\n\"Right. What's in the box again?\" He sounded dazed.\n\n\"I don't know. But it's still in there. And it's not coming out.\" I smiled reassuringly after taking a look at my phone. \"And it's almost time for us to leave.\"\n\nEli slowly sat up and buried his face in his hands. \n\n\"Were you having a panic attack?\" I inquired.\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"Is it over?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" he repeated, turning to face me. \n\n\"Let's get out of here.\" I stood up and offered him my hand. I had to dig my heels into the floor for him to pull up his massive body. \n\n\"But the shift isn't over, is it?\" he rasped out. \"No, no; we've made it this far, let's not waste it.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" I relented, biting my lip. \"If you're really alright with that.\"\n\n\"I am,\" he insisted. \"It's over, it really is.\" He slowly turned to glance at the container. \"What the fuck is locked up in there?\"\n\n\"Whatever it is, it's not doing anything real, it's just\u2026 it's been making us see things. And hear things,\" I said quietly. \"Has to be.\"\n\n\"So what do you think it is?\"\n\n\"We shouldn't think about it. Let's get this over with.\"\n\nWe spent the remaining time in relative silence. When the masked person returned, they paid us in cash. Sure, we could have pried open that container and sated our curiosity, but I'm very glad neither of us succumbed to that urge. We divided the money between the two of us and Eli drove me home, depositing me on my doorstep after reassuring me that he was okay. I made him promise he'd drive by Nettie's\u2014she'd undoubtedly share her breakfast and some lighthearted conversation to pick him back up. \n\nI retired to my bedroom to catch up on some rest. And here I am now. It's weird; when you spend a whole night awake, it doesn't feel like a day has passed. It all simply blends into each other. I've already texted Eli, and he seems to be doing fine. I'm kind of rattled after the entire thing, but hey, I've got money now! This should take care of things around here for at least two months, so I can't say I regret it. Kit has finally left her room and appears to currently be making lunch in the kitchen. She looks much better than the last time we spoke, but I'm not going to corner her. I hope I can talk to her later, maybe after Frankie was here. He's coming over later. I am\u2026 weirdly excited.\n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13dr5g0/help_im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[2: deadbeat roommate](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13eovqy/im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_also_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[3: creepy crush](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13fnc4u/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_everyone/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[4: relocation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13gjpwd/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_does_anybody/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[5: beach concert](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13heih5/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[6: First date](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ib2es/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_my_first/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[8: roommate talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13k8088/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_a_talk_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

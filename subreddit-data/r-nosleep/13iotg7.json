There, when the first monsters rose to terrorize the weak. There, when first alchemists developed the art of enchanting.\n\nThey called themselves the Company, and the band of brothers traveled the world, hunting down those who terrorized the weak and storing cursed artifacts away. Their network of warehouses, agents, and outposts expanded as the centuries past. Kings, queens, emperors and presidents all found themselves working with the company. In the old days, nobles sponsored them. Now, senators and congressmen. They\u2019ve kept the world safe for thousands of years. Their methods of recovering artifacts and punishing the wrong hands have been carefully developed. They fight the black market, swearing an oath to lock all the bizarre away. \n\nUnfortunately, I don\u2019t work for the Company. I\u2019m the polar opposite- I\u2019m the black market the Company so wishes to crush.\n\nMy name is Quentin Lorreno. I\u2019m somewhat of a middleman in the criminal underworld. I mediate the crime families, I arrange diplomatic marriages, I keep things civil.\n\nBut above all I host auctions. Art is a tastefully wonderful medium of laundering money, and hosting both underworld- and legal auctions is kind of my speciality.And I also recover and sell cursed artifacts.Long before the business was mine it was my father\u2019s. And before him, it was his grandfather\u2019s. This lineage continued on and on, and I traced to somewhere either in the heart of Italy, or some backwards village in Britain.I couldn\u2019t be sure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come with a warning,\u201d Corelli announced, opening the halls of the place, shouting. \u201cAnd a gift.\u201d\n\nI stopped out of my office, suspicious. Sure, Corelli was taking back her power and protecting the world. \u201cI thought we were done, Corelli.\u201d I pointed out. \u201cYou\u2019ve retrieved the last of your cursed paintings.\u201d\n\nShe raised her hands, telling us she was no threat. My team rushed in. We didn\u2019t believe her. \u201cWhat can we do for you?\u201d Steven asked.\n\nI noted a suitcase near her feet. I also noted she\u2019d come alone, no guards this time, not like the previous times. \u201cWhat\u2019s in there?\u201d I demanded. \u201cWhere are your guards?\u201d\n\nShe laughed, and slid the case over to me. \u201cMy guards were Painted Men.\u201d This came as a shock. I thought all the Painted Men were dangerous, vicious things- but then again, we\u2019d only encountered one.\n\nAster reached into the ether, eyes growing wide, skin, pale. \u201cDon\u2019t open it!\u201d she warned, shrill. The force of whatever was inside the case weakened her, and Matt caught her as she fell. \u201cIt\u2019s more powerful than anything- I-\u201d\n\nAster collapsed. Steven set himself to work on a healing spell.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in the case?\u201d I questioned, inspecting it. Great symbols of an unknown language covered it, carefully painted by an expert\u2019s hand. \u201cAnother painting of yours.\u201d\n\nShe laughed at that too. Clearly there was something we weren\u2019t understanding. \u201cIt\u2019s all the paintings- I crushed their power and turned them into one.\u201d She gestured for me to open. \u201cIt\u2019s safe, not to worry.\u201d\n\nI looked at my team, then at the briefcase.\n\nI opened the case, witnessing the marvel that was inside. It was a single painting, rolled trapped beyond a glass frame, symbols carved into the shield glowing, fighting back the sheer power of the art.\n\nIt was incomprehensible- no, it was alive. The paint swirled and formed distant lands and dreams. It painted demons and angels. It lurched out and fell back in, needing to be free- kept back by only the finest of enchantments.\n\n\u201cGreat Keon!\u201d I swore. \u201cWhy have you brought this here?\u201d\n\nMatt came over, observed and shook his head. \u201cGet that thing away from us!\u201d\n\nI closed the case and slid it back to the immortal artist. \u201cNo,\u201d I told, \u201cI don\u2019t want this \u2018gift\u2019. We\u2019re not selling this to anyone.\u201d\n\nCorelli slid it back over. \u201cYou misunderstand,\u201d she argued, \u201cI don\u2019t want tis to be sold. You\u2019re the only people who have faced my work and survived- I am entrusting you with my masterpiece.\u201d\n\nSteven finished the spell, and a rejuvenated Aster sprung to life. \u201cThen take it to the Company,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cI\u2019m sure they can keep it safer than us.\u201d\n\nShe only shook her head and faced away, ready to leave. \u201cI don\u2019t trust the Company. Too much bureaucracy. No freedom.\u201d Steven weaved a spell and the door slammed shut.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Aster snarled, \u201ctake this monster back with you!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not letting you go without it!\u201d I concluded, closing the case and locking it shut.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll even need it against the Company,\u201d she foretold, shaking her head.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I demanded. \u201cI don\u2019t want this thing here!\u201d\n\nShe faced us once more and stared with a solemn, wisened look on her face. \u201cOh, my sweet, summer children,\u201d she quoted, sitting down on the floor, crossed legged. \u201cRemember that the Painter only goes after those who dream.\u201d\n\nAnd with that she melted.\n\nHer clothes and skin became oily- paint. Her skin turned to wax, melting away. Her face contorted into nothingness and she collapsed, slowly, one limb melting away at a time.\n\nBefore any of us could react, Isabella Corelli, artist of the world\u2019s most dangerous artifacts, was a puddle on the floor of our lobby.\n\nOnly a spiral of color was left. \u201cIs she\u2026 gone?\u201d I wondered. \u201cDid she leave- or is she dead?\u201d\n\nAster touched the spiral of color. The paint didn\u2019t stick- no, it was embedded within. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d She pressed her hands against it. \u201cNothing here. Just a sense of\u2026 nothing and yet- a feeling of hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cI-\u201d there was a certain quality to the air now, something rustled our spirits and enlightened our self, \u201cI feel it too.\u201d\n\nMatt touched the spiral. He nodded.\n\nSteven, however, had his suspicious. He ran up a flight of stairs leading to the alchemy room, and observed from above. \u201cIt\u2019s not a spiral,\u201d he noted, shouting. \u201cIt\u2019s a symbol.\u201d\n\nWe followed him up the small group of stars and watched. Yes, it seemed like a spiral; the paints were everywhere and thin, distant. But on further- farther inspection it was a face.\n\nThe face of a woman, neither old nor young, screaming in agony. \u201cCorelli!\u201d Matt gasped. \u201cShe\u2019s-\u201d\n\n\u201cDead?\u201d I finished.\n\nAster had a more complete view through the ether with the complete picture. \u201cNo.\u201d I held her as she dissociated into the beyond. \u201cThere\u2019s a yellow door- and something beyond it.\u201d Her skin grew colder as she witnessed. \u201cIt has her- she\u2019s both a slave and free.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat it?\u201d Steven asked. \u201cCan you see?\u201d\n\nAster\u2019s temperature dropped drastically. I was about to tell her to cut the connection before she cut me off. \u201cIt\u2019s marvelous! It\u2019s painting the world- so many arms, so many-\u201d\n\nAster choked. \u201cGet out!\u201d I ordered. \u201cCut the connection- Steven!\u201d my assistant spoke the dead tongue and chanted.\n\nThe psychic rose up into the air, levitating off the ground. Her skin and clothes rippled like waves, and- \u201cYou would Witness me?\u201d a voice, bright and unnerving, cried. \u201cWho has summoned me?\u201d\n\nI stepped back as tendrils of paint erupted from Aster\u2019s mouth- but it was too late, and the tendrils wrapped around my head.\n\nSuddenly, I wasn\u2019t in the auction house. I was in a field of green, high up in the mountains. The sun shone, the clouds drifted. In the center of the field, Corelli painted, a picture I could not see.\n\nI felt a weight upon me, \u201cGet off- Aster?\u201d She embraced me, terrified. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d\n\nIn front of us, paint rose from the ground, and the swarm of color merged into an ever-changing flow that seemed nearly human.\n\n\u201cDo you dream?\u201d it asked, tilting its head. \u201cDo you wish to change the world?\u201d\n\nI remembered Corelli\u2019s words about the Painter. \u201cNo! I want to go back- with my friend.\u201d\n\nOne of the being\u2019s four arms reached out, and a finger touched my head. \u201cYou lie.\u201d It thought more. \u201cYou wish for peace between humans and Stetski. Survival for the fair-folk. Dreams to uncover the sins of your father.\u201d It receded the hand. \u201cYou would deny the gift of art? To change the world?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ability to paint monsters to life isn\u2019t what I\u2019d call art,\u201d I snarled. \u201cThat\u2019s what you gave Corelli, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nThe Painter merely laughed at that. \u201cI merely gave herself the tools she needed.\u201d It gestured at the woman, smiling and painting in the distance. \u201cShe chose to bring those horrors into the world. And now-\u201d visions of the past sprung around us, \u201cshe has finally changed what she wanted to, so long ago.\u201d\n\nI saw her as a little girl, in the ages so long past. I saw her older, a gift given to by the Painter. Things I could not quite fathom. Reasons I understood, all too well. \u201cIs this the end for her?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs she dead?\u201d\n\nThe visions faded. \u201cThis is paradise. Nothing is ever truly dead.\u201d The Painter stepped back, and sat down, folding its four arms together. \u201cI offer you the gift to change the world yet again.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I replied. Sure, the gifts it had given Corelli had worked. A cruel suitor, killed by the face of god. The Painted Man, created to defend her against a witch-hunt. But her paintings were also used for evil by those who found it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIt sighed, breathfully. \u201cKhysteus of the White Door has fallen,\u201d he murmured, a hand scratching its chin. \u201cI need an avatar on the solid plane.\u201d It pointed at Aster.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she rebutted. \u201cSend us back.\u201d\n\nIt sighed, weaved a circle with its paint and we were back in the House, terrified, but relieved. Aster was by me, safe, and a floating painted form remained in the air.\n\n\u201cI am the Painter of the Blue Door,\u201d it introduced. \u201cReach into the Blue Door should you seek to change your mind.\u201d\n\nAnd then the entity fell into the floor, and disappeared. No paint stain, no great artwork. The painting of Corelli shifted to that of happiness, oddly.\n\n\u201cThat was,\u201d Steven murmured, \u201can experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were there?\u201d I asked, confused. Only Aster and I had been there. Matt looked at us in confusion. \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll your father\u2019s secrets,\u201d he said. I told him about the Painter\u2019s offer to change the world. \u201cIt told- showed me everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need to know,\u201d I pleaded. \u201cI need to-\u201d\n\nThe lights flickered, dimming into darkness. We all stood silent, afraid, and then the Conduit kicked in, and the emergency lights emerged.\n\nBasked in red, we waited intently. A piercing siren rang through the building, like needles through skin. I paced down the stairs, and into the office.\n\nMy computer flashed a warning, from a program that I hadn\u2019t ever seen.\u201cWarning,\u201d Matt read, nervous. \u201cCompany Seven Detected. Initiate System Lockdown?\u201d\n\nI clicked onto the security camera app, and just as the warning had told, there they were. Three black vans, and more arriving by the second.\n\nAgents with uniforms, a VII stitched onto them, got out, priming their rifles, spellbooks. \n\nThey had come with battle in mind, a battle we would surely lose. Steven swore.\n\nThe day had finally come. We\u2019d crossed the line, broken the code. And like hyenas to prey, they came to kill.\n\nA middle aged woman stepped out of a van, more patches on her uniform than the other. She raised a megaphone up and shouted, \u201cHouse of Lorreno!\u201d She waited, directing her people. \u201cWe have you surrounded! Come out peacefully and into our custody. We give you sixty seconds.\n\n\u201dI tapped the PA system and spoke into the microphone. \u201cWe don\u2019t want trouble!\u201d that elicited a reaction, one of cruel laughter from the woman. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you whatever artifact you want- all of them.\n\n\u201dShe waved over a soldier, one I recognized was my smuggler and information- Canopy. \u201cI thought he was on our side?\u201d Steven hissed, angry. \u201cHe told us he\u2019d rather work for the market than them!\u201dCanopy took the microphone then. \n\n\u201cQuentin, Aster, Steven,\u201d he paused, thinking, \u201cOther Guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Matt sighed.\n\nCanopy began, \u201cListen, you guys aren\u2019t bad people, and you know the artifact trade is host to deadly people. And you know we have the power to cut you down, right here and now.\u201d Canopy waved an agent over, who emerged with a rocket launcher. \u201cYou\u2019ve broken the Doorway Act of 1738: no person, Human, Stetski, or otherwise may make contact with an avatar or servant willingly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked, confused. We had done no such thing.The woman snatched the megaphone out from Canopy\u2019s hands. \u201cListen here, Lorreno.\u201d She said my name with vile disgust. I recoiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve made contact and worked for Isabella Corelli, avatar of the Painter not once, but two times. The artifacts of Corelli must be stored safely or destroyed- and we know you have them.\n\n\u201d\u201cNo we don\u2019t,\u201d I lied.\n\nCanopy took the megaphone. The woman whispered something into his ear. \u201cListen here, friend.\u201d He sighed. \u201cBreaking this law is punishable by death, but Chairwoman Manson here has offered you a deal: life in a maximum security prison under our control.\u201d\n\nManson took back the device. \u201cNow, come out- or we blow your little auction house to bits.\u201dThey threw the megaphone on the ground and started to ready the agents. I looked to my team for help. I, for the first time in many days, was truly, and utterly terrified.\n\nSteven shook his head and patted my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s a bluff- they wouldn\u2019t risk unleashing anything we have in here.\u201d I switched over to the warning popup. \u201cYour father never trusted me with his secrets. But if we live through this- I\u2019ll tell you everything the Painter showed me.\u201d\n\nI clicked on the popup. System lockdown was initiated. The lights began to fade in and out, signaling a lockdown.\n\nA click fell into place, and the entrance to the auction house erupted in a wall of flame, and I audibly gasped in awe. Symbols on the wall, long enchanted burst to life, bolts of energy finding us and blessing our bodies, making us stronger, healthier, more powerful.\n\nWalls of flame burst through other entrances, even the office door. But as we neared it, it vanished, allowing us access.\n\n\u201cI suppose this was one of my father\u2019s secrets?\u201d I asked, touching a symbol.\u201cI suppose so,\u201d Steven answered. He picked up the briefcase from where I\u2019d left it, and we passed through flame, heading into the armory.\n\nI found my weapons. Steven found and uploaded spellbooks to his phone. Aster reached deep into the ether and called upon the spirits of her ancestors. Matt simply loaded his rifle and selected some additions.\n\n\u201cAli\u2019s backpack,\u201d I reminded, taking the infinite backpack off a shelf. \u201cGrab anything useful- it\u2019s time.\u201d\n\n\u201cTime?\u201d Aster puzzled\n\nI sighed. \u201cTime to abandon home,\u201d I explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t out fight the Company. We\u2019re going to have to do the best we can- even if it means we choose violence, and run.\u201d\n\nWe stood there, silent.\n\nThe auction house, for us, had been a place of rest. A home, to some of us, me included. This was the only stable place I\u2019d truly known, despite the weirdness and chaos that came with it.\n\nFor Aster, her decision to join the House was one made for freedom. She\u2019s been locked in captivity as a traditional Canary, subjected to dangerous artifacts and offerings to forgotten gods.Steven had served her long before me. And though my father never quite trusted him due his closeness to the fae, he\u2019d seen the full potential of a well run House, and the secrets of the past.\n\nI didn\u2019t know much about Matt. He\u2019d been part of the Guild of Arken, an ageless group dedicated to killing monsters. I suspected the cruel, unforgiving punishments they meted on even peaceful \u2018monsters\u2019 were the reason he left. I suppose the House was his odd way of a better life.The doors in front burst open. \n\nA shout, and the fires were gone. \u201cThis is Canopy!\u201d We stepped from the auction room and headed down the stairs, making a beeline to the Conduit Room. \u201cSurrender now- or face the wrath of the Company!\u201d\n\nWe passed through the halls, stopping to check within each room and stuffing the most prized of artifacts into the ever expanding backpack. A trinket here, a gauntlet there.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d an agent yelled, gun pointed at us as we turned from a storage hall. \u201cHands in the air!\u201d\n\nI raised my hands but kicked the shelf, causing it to tumble. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d We fled the scene as the spells broke, unleashing terrible curses we didn\u2019t wait to see.\n\nWe reached the Conduit Room. Steven turned levers and switches, locking us inside, a blast door closing, enchanted symbols glowing.\n\nMatt panted, tired, gun pointed at the door. \u201cIs there a way outta this place?\u201d\n\nSteven waved at the conduit, and a symbol cast a map of the underground layer into the air. \u201cI can make us a path!\u201d And he started to rearrange the rooms- and the walls, floors shifted as the entire facility moved.\n\n\u201cWoah!\u201d I gasped. \u201cThis is a thing?!\u201d\n\nSteven frowned. He waved again, and dots erupted- red for the Company, green for the House, and purple for any unleashed spirits. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the entire building surrounded.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we can\u2019t go outside,\u201d Matt snarled. Outside, the agents began to knock on the blast door, and then we heard chantes as they began to dispel it. \u201cPlan B, Steven?\u201d\n\nSteven paused, searching through the map. \u201cIt\u2019s on here,\u201d he told, \u201cbut one of the things your father never told me- that the Painter did,\u201d he used his magic, and an extra room appeared on the far side of the underground. \u201cIs that room. There\u2019s an artifact-\u201d\n\nAster reached into the ether- and the new, once-hidden room. \u201cA Stetski archgate!\u201d How, exactly, my father had one of the most elusive pieces of Stetski technology, I was looking forward to hearing.\n\nSteven nodded, confirming. \u201cI can prime the archgate-\u201d the spells on the blast door receded, \u201cbut we\u2019ll need to fight our way there!\u201d\n\nThe door lifted, slightly, and a sphere was tossed in. \u201cLightsphere!\u201d\n\nSteven raised his hands, and webs of light appeared in the air as the sphere exploded, the blinding light catching into the net.\n\nCanopy, flanked by six agents appeared, guns pointed. \u201cThis is your last chance, Lorreno-\u201d Steven collapsed the net, and the light burst forth, blinding the green-haired man and our enemies.\n\nI deactivated the blast doors, and the one behind us opened. We ran through it, Matt firing at the mechanism, bringing it down.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t hold them for long.\n\nI stopped in my tracks. \u201cWait!\u201d holding the bag, I suddenly realized something. \u201cWe forgot Ali!\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn it!\u201d Matt swore. We\u2019d locked the owner\u2026 somewhere. \u201cLet\u2019s worry about him later.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d me and Aster concurred.\n\nGunfire erupted behind us. I drew into a bag, found a strange looking idol, ripped off the protective label and threw it.\n\nA golem, rocky, angry, and powerful emerged. A Company squad appeared, firing at the golem. No matter: this was not our business.\n\nSteven cast the map- we were just a few more halls away.\n\nI tripped, falling, and found myself staring at the room where we\u2019d found both skeleton and mimic. Steven had moved it there, apparently. \u201cThe bones!\u201d I shouted. This could be important. \u201cGet the bones!\u201d\n\nAster reached out, and the bones came flying into the bag, as well as the broken telephone and the box we\u2019d trapped the mimic. I looked at her, amazed. \u201cThat book really came in handy!\u201dTwo Company agents appeared in front of us, spellbooks in hand.\n\nThey casted fire at us, but Steven found a rib, one the Stetski Jim had paid us with and shouted unspeakable words. A bolt of red struck them both down, and they writhed in pain.Four came behind us. Steven turned, one hand with the rib shooting bolts, the other casting bright magic reminiscent of that of the fae.Everything, now, was coming in handy.\n\nThe battle continued on. More agents seemed to emerge from the woodwork the closer we got. And through sheer luck (and Steven\u2019s raw power) we managed survive, finally coming across our main storage room.\u201cAcross this room- that wall-\u201d Steven pointed. \u201cJust run through it!\u201dThe room looked large, and the path to safety seemed like an eternity away. But we could make it, all of us. I was sure.\n\nSo we ran, running faster than I had ever run before.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re-\u201d we arrived at the wall, about to cross the it- \u201cwhat the-\u201d time seemed to shift around us, and we were back on the far end.\n\nCanopy was in the center of the room, reading from a book, holding pistol aimed in the other. \u201cLittle trick I picked up from Maisie Krylov and the God of Time,\u201d he informed. \u201cI\u2019m serious now- it\u2019s your last, final chance.\u201d\n\nI practically hissed at my once friend, turned enemy. I guess he\u2019d been reporting on us all along, waiting, watching until we finally crossed the line. \u201cCome on, Canopy. For old times sake?\u201d\n\nHe shook his head and spoke into the radio. \u201cKyran, Rainie, send your teams to my position.\u201d He smiled at us, content. Was Kyran, the one we\u2019d encountered at Newhall in on it too? \u201cI\u2019ve got them.\u201d\n\nSteven raised the rib, read from his phone, and fired a bolt of energy. Canopy did the same, orbs of power swirling from his spellbook and meeting the bolts midway.\n\nMatt and I fired, only for his magic to reduce our bullets to ash. Aster reached into his mind. No effect; he was too well trained.\n\nBut Steven seemed to win, building up more bolts that neared Canopy, and one- BANG!\n\nCanopy fired his pistol as a bolt struck him across the chest, sending him flying. Steven yelped and I saw blood leak from his stomach. \u201cSteven- heal yourself!\u201d\n\nHe grimaced and picked himself up, heading to the wall. \u201cDamn it- it\u2019s-\u201d I heard the march of the other agents approaching, \u201cenchanted steel. It\u2019ll take- not here.\u201d\n\nWe passed through the wall, and the entire thing disintegrated, revealing to all- even the Company a small room, computers lining the sides, three skeletons with phones in their hands, dead.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Aster snipped. \u201cMore of these?!\u201d The phones started to ring, already beginning to whisper.\n\nIn the center was the archgate, a large, ring-shaped portal inscribed with ancient Stetski words. Before it was also a coffin, filled with the glimmering skeleton of a long dead holy Stetski.\n\n\u201cSteven- the gate!\u201d Matt reminded, eyes trained on Canopy, the man starting to recover.\n\nThe magician, wincing, began to chant, and the words of the gate began to light up.\n\n\u201cYou may escape,\u201d Canopy snarled, gathering his things, taking a step back. \u201cBut she\u2019ll always find you. Chairwoman Manson always gets what she wants.\u201d he looked around as he backed into Company men fast approaching. \u201cWe\u2019ll follow you through the gate- chase you across the world- all to keep everything we hold dear safe!\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t really blame him. From his point of view, we did do some really shady activities.\n\nThe archgate exploded to life, the empty center opening into a field I\u2019d seen before, one near the city we passed every time we left. I sighed in true relief, fear leaving my body.\n\n\u201cI never wanted this, Canopy,\u201d I pointed out, backing away.\n\nThe agents burst into the storage room. \u201cNever should\u2019ve gotten into the business,\u201d he chided. Aster passed through the gate, then Matt, and me. \u201cOne last chance- or the next time.\u201d He mimed a gun at our heads.\n\nSteven backed away, and collapsed. I went back in from the field, ready to drag the old man away.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d he shouted. \u201cBack in the portal!\u201d\n\nI puzzled over it, confused. \u201cBut you-\u201d\n\nHe looked at me with tears in his eyes. \u201cI have to close the portal. Your father-\u201d the agents began to fire, and he cast a quick protection spell, \u201cleft a book with all his secrets in the House of Stet\u2019Ren. Find the Stetski, Ren- and you will have your answers.\u201d\n\n\u201cSteven, can\u2019t you-\u201d he shook his head and with a wave of magic, pushed me back through the portal. \u201cYou\u2019ll die!\u201d\n\nHe stood, now, facing the wrath of the company. \u201cOnly works from here, kiddo.\u201d I suddenly realized he\u2019d snatched the briefcase out of my hands. \u201cAnd I\u2019m about old enough anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you-\u201d Canopy burst, as Steven unlatched the briefcase.\n\nSteven faced death at the hands of the Company. But he\u2019d take as many as he could with him- the lines had already passed into war.\n\nThe shield failed, and twin bullets pierced him. \u201cYou want the Corelli?!\u201d he snapped, opening the briefcase.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Canopy growled, running into the crowd, out of the room. \u201cLook and you\u2019ll die!\u201d\n\nHe raised the glass up into the air- and the dozen or so agents, thinking he\u2019d cast a spell, fired at it, shattering the glass and freeing the masterpiece. \u201cCome get it yourself!\u201d\n\nAnd the thing from the painting burst in heavenly light, and the agents of the Company stared, entranced, taken by the view of the unheavenly art. And they melted away, turning to oil and wax, fading into puddles of paint.\n\nAnd though Steven did not witness, coils of paint encircled his wrists, and soon, he too, began to melt away.\n\nHe whispered a final blessing to us, closing the archgate and leaving us alone, only with each other for company.\n\nThe fact that Steven had stayed behind to save us hit Matt first. \u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d he murmured, falling onto the grass. \u201cHe\u2019s really gone.\u201d\n\nAster reached out into time and space, hopeful. But nothing. \u201cHe\u2019s- at peace. One with the Painter.\u201d\n\nSteven had raised me, cared for me, served me. And now, he was gone. Everything I\u2019d known was gone.\n\nThe House of Lorreno had been taken by the Company, seized by an agent watching us all along. Nothing left in our possession, our debt to the Stetski Crime Families unpaid.\n\nKimber Manson, Fifth Chairwoman of the Company was after us now.\n\nShe'd fight us to the death, tooth and nail. There would be no escaping here. Only battles, one after the other. And we had to survive too, out of a job, only with the artifacts we\u2019d grabbed as coin.\n\nBut though we were in dire straits and lost but for the tiniest sense of hope, we could survive.\n\nI had my father\u2019s book to find. A reason behind the mimics and the bones. An explanation for the things he left hidden away. A generational debt to certain Stetski to pay.\n\nNo, this was not the end of the House of Lorreno. There would always be more.\n\n[House of Lorreno ](https://www.reddit.com/r/JulianPageInstitute?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

I hope y'all kick The Company's self righteous ass! And I really hope we get some more backstory about how Aster got away from being a \"traditional\" Canary and Matt decided to leave the Guild of Arken. Good luck Quentin and crew; who knows, maybe The Painter can help y'all out.",

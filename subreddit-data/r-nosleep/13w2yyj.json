    "postText": "Not all change is bad, but not all change is advantageous either, especially when it involves disfigurations and body part swapping. \u2018What doesn\u2019t kill you, only makes you stronger.\u2019 I tend to disagree in certain circumstances. I doubt surviving a train wreck makes you stronger. At this point in my life, I feel as weak as I have ever been. I feel odd and peculiar, a stranger to my own body, a monster to my soul.\n\nSeveral months ago, as I was lying in bed a wave of red light poured in through my window, accompanied by a hypnotic vibrating purr, that put me in a deep sleep. When I woke up my left hand felt swollen. At first, I thought nothing of it but as I went through my morning routine, things felt different. My grasp wasn\u2019t as strong, but it wasn\u2019t just that, it felt as if I had a different tactile sensation altogether. I finally became conscious of the extent of the difference when I went to brush my teeth.\n\nI grabbed the toothbrush with my right hand and the tube of toothpaste with my left hand. As I tried to line the nozzle to the toothbrush, I noticed that my left hand was slightly bigger than my right hand and had a darker skin tone. The contrast was striking. I have a very fair skin complexion. My mom always said that I was \u2018Irish\u2019 white, that she would lose sight of me walking to the mailbox through a snowstorm.\n\nI dropped the dental toiletries in the sink. I held my hands up in front of my face. I never chewed my nails, but on my left hand, the nails were almost chewed down to the cuticle. I turned my hands over and they were as different as night and day. The left was calloused from hard work and dedicated labor, the other was the pampered hands of a college student. Around the wrist of my new left hand was a bracelet of thick dark stitches, hardly signifying friendship or wealth.\n\nI had to call the police, but when I got my phone, there was a text message:\n\n*Don\u2019t go to the police, or we\u2019ll remove your head. No more procedures needed.*\n\nI wasn\u2019t too sure what to do at that point. Whoever did this was able to- in one night- knock me out, surgically remove my hand and replace it with someone else\u2019s hand. If they were able to do that, then I was certain they would be able to get in and do much worse.\n\nLuckily, I was in between semesters, no classes to attend, nothing as of yet to explain. Even though it was hot as hell and it was in the middle of Summer, I put on a long sleeve shirt and a pair of gloves. My left glove barely fit, and the phrase \u2018If it don\u2019t fit, you must acquit\u2019 popped in my head. I frequented the food truck parked in the convenient store parking lot near my apartment building at least three times a week. They have the best burrito I have ever eaten, bursting with meat and spices, not any of those lean stingy burritos you get at traditional restaurants. But lately, there has been this strange street person hanging out at the corner. He showed up around a month before my ordeal. He was not begging for money but preaching about an invasion. He was always dressed as if it was forty below zero.\n\nInstead of walking along the sidewalk, I decided to climb down the hill from my apartment that led directly to the back of the convenient store. From my deck, I could watch the customers go in and out of the store. The apartment building sat on a high hill overlooking the street below. I could see that the homeless man wasn\u2019t at his usual corner, but I didn\u2019t want to take any chances.\n\nI got down the hill and hopped down from the retaining wall, when all of the sudden he jumped out from behind the dumpster, dressed in a long trench coat, gloves, a ski mask, and a scarf wrapped around his neck.\n\n\u201cThey got ya son. They\u2019ve tagged you. I saw the red light. I\u2019ve been tracking them for a while. You ain\u2019t getting away and they ain\u2019t stopping. You need to come with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMister, I don\u2019t have any money I can give you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want your damn money son. I\u2019m here to save your life.\"\n\nI tried to walk past him, but he blocked my path and pushed me back. As he did so he started unwrapping his scarf and pulling off his ski mask. I resumed my attempt to get to my favorite burrito, but he blocked me again. I was looking down, not paying attention, so I didn\u2019t notice that he was completely unmasked with his trench coat and shirt laying on the ground.\n\n\u201cLook here!\u201d\n\nI looked up to see the most grotesque, confusing human being I had ever perceived. He was a patchwork of different races, different skin tones, and stitched up scars running throughout his body and face like a map of a river and its many tributaries. His nose was completely foreign to his face and both eyes were awkwardly strung together from two different individuals. Worst of all, there was a large scar around his neck, indicating that this head had been removed and reattached.\n\n\u201cThey told you that they were done, right?\u201d I nodded my head in agreement. \u201cWell, I\u2019m proof that they are a bunch of damn liars. I hate to tell you this, but your life is over as you know it. You can come with me and stay intact or refuse my help and become what I am today.\u201d\n\nI should have taken his advice, but I wasn\u2019t in a state to comprehend the reality of my situation. I was still unsure of what I had seen this morning. I was trying to convince myself that I had just slept on my hand or had a bad dream and slammed it against the wall. It was just swollen, not someone else\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine man. I just want a burrito. Leave me alone, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll still be here when you are ready. There\u2019s a place we like to call the Isle of Misfit Toys. You know from Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer. You\u2019ll be safe there. I promise you, it's not going away.\u201d\n\nI started to walk away, determined to ignore him, but then he said something that caught my attention.\n\n\u201cI bet you are O negative blood type. All us misfit toys are O negative. Universal donor baby. Now how did I know that? You still want to turn a blind eye.\u201d\n\nHe was correct, but I persisted in my stubbornness and walked away. That day the burrito just didn\u2019t taste as well as it normally did. Was there a new cook? I didn\u2019t notice. Or worse, had they already replaced my tongue with someone else\u2019s, whoever they were?\n\nThere weren\u2019t any other occurrences for the next month. I made sure to sleep in the living room on the couch with the television on. Still, Mr. Frankenstein stood on the corner, waiting for me. I didn\u2019t visit the food truck that entire month, didn\u2019t have the usual craving and sure as hell didn\u2019t want to have another confrontation.\n\nThe next month was my wake-up call. I was dozing off when the television shut off by itself. I heard that familiar hum and saw the red light moving through the front window. I put my fingers in my ears, closed my eyes and stumbled to the bathroom. I started singing to myself, hoping to drown out the noise and stay conscious. I opened my eyes for a second and saw that the red light was moving under the door and bending upwards towards my face. I shut my eyes again.\n\nThe bathroom door slammed open. I closed my eyes tighter, so much so that I saw twinkling stars and sparks. I felt two hands grasp me by the shoulders and lift me up in the air. I opened my eyes. There standing before me was tall hairless grey being in a long black cloak. The creature had no eyes, small narrow nostrils, but a large gaping mouth, affixed open as if the creature was unable to close it. On his shoulder was a smaller green creature with a bulbous head and large eyes. It was not clothed and would ever so often lay its forehead against the side of the larger creature\u2019s neck. It seemed to be a symbiotic relationship.\n\nThe larger creature sat me back down and lifted up his three-fingered hand. Out of the palm of his hand radiated a red light. The smaller creature was somehow making the humming noise, and within a few seconds I lost consciousness.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up in my bedroom upstairs. I frantically searched my entire body but saw nothing, but I wasn\u2019t convinced by that cursory search, and sure enough, my suspicions were correct. I went to the bathroom and looked at the mirror. Staring back at me was a somewhat unfamiliar face. My right eye was now green instead of blue, and the skin tone around it was darker. Even my eyebrow was more pointed. Encircling a wide area of the eye was a ring of stitches. I fell to the floor, exasperated by what I had seen, and what I had become. It was time to visit Mr. Frankenstein.\n\nI didn\u2019t try to hide my eye. I can easily explain it away as corrective surgery, the first of its kind, if anyone was so bold, or rude, to ask. I found him at the corner as expected. He didn\u2019t gloat or say \u2018I told you so.\u2019 He was sympathetic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry man. Come on. Let me take you to your new home.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to fight them\u2026 or stop them?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe in time, but all we know how to do right now is hide and keep them from tracking us.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you keep them from tracking us?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to like it, but we got to dig a tracking device from in between your lower ribs.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t too thrilled about that but then again, I\u2019d rather go through a little suffering on the front end to avoid any more experimental alien body part swapping.\n\nWe walked down the main highway to a backroad where there was an old, abandoned warehouse. He gave a coded knock to let them know that it was a friend and then turned to me.\n\n\u201cBy the way, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cRobert, but you can call me Rob.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Frank, as in Frankenstein.\u201d\n\nI laughed and explained to him that I had already begun calling him Mr. Frankenstein. I felt a little weird admitting that, so I apologized.\n\n\u201cNo need to apologize. I like the name. I honestly don\u2019t know my real name. I just picked that one.\u201d\n\nThe door opened and there was a hooded man with his face hidden.\n\n\u201cWelcome home Frank. Got a new one huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep, sure do Phil. Let\u2019s make him feel at home.\u201d\n\nWe walked through the door into a small homemade foyer. Some drywall had been thrown up and fortified with wooden pallets and barbed wire. There was yet another door. It was a thick steel door with a peephole. Phil gave another coded knock. A woman armed with a gun slung over her shoulders opened the door. Her face was riddled with scars and one of her eyes were bulging. She had the same mismatched facial features that Frank had.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the Isle of Misfit Toys,\u201d announced Frank.\n\nIt was a big open space with many cots strewn about all four walls. As we walked around and toured my new home, Frank introduced me to everyone. It was all the same. The scars and parts were different, but the procedure was recognizable. There were even children, little misshapen research subjects imprisoned in a world devoid of holidays and birthday parties, or at least in the normal sense. This world tries to operate as normal, but in the end, it's difficult to be normal when you\u2019re hidden and locked away in a warehouse. We\u2019re all victims traumatized by our encounters with ghastly reminders etched on our bodies and faces. Our minds are no less effected. There\u2019s a big handwritten sign hanging over the entrance door. It reads: No Red Lights.",

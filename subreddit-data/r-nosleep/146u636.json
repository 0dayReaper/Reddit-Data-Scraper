    "postText": "\"I wonder what people with normal friends are doing tonight,\" Elijah Carter said, gracing me with a sidelong glance. \n\nWe were sitting on the edge of the cliff, just him, Nettie Peterson, Frankie and me. The ladies from the diner had already left, wanting to avoid the hassle. Mary Markov had promised to be there with her staff in half an hour. She was preparing for something big. We all were, in a way. The area around the cave had fallen silent, and it was that silence that had been unnerving us for the last couple minutes. Most of us, at any rate. Eli was twitchy\u2014the tension in the muscles of his arms and shoulders gave him away. They coiled and uncoiled, tensed and relaxed in barely noticeable but hectic intervals. His long legs were dangling over the rim of the precipice, crossed at the ankles. He was staring down moodily, but with a hint of his usual weary, sarcastic smile. I took that as a good sign.\n\nMy savior human had tried and failed to stay seated. She was pacing to and fro behind us, wringing her hands and occasionally muttering to herself. \"I wish you didn't sit so close to the edge,\" she told me for the third time that night. \n\n\"I'm close to the edge, too,\" Elijah remarked, giving her an odd look. \n\n\"Well, are you gonna listen to me and scoot back?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"There you go, then. Big idiot.\" She waved him off. \"And you,\" she addressed Frankie, \"I don't know you so I'd be a phony if I made a fuss, but you're just as bad. No. Worse. You're worse.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" Fran replied sweetly, shifting a little so his feet stuck out over the cliff. His head was in the mold between my crossed legs, and one of his hands was gripping my knee, passively preventing me from moving. I shot him a quick glance. *Don't start.*\n\n\"You're so\u2026 nonchalant,\" Nettie grunted. \"You're enjoying this, aren't you? This is like a show to you.\"\n\n\"A bit,\" he admitted, not sounding very bothered by the fact. \n\n\"How?\" my savior human asked, her tone flat and stony. \n\nFrankie lifted his head just enough to meet her gaze. \"I won't start another fight. I like this thingy here\u2014\" he pointed at me, \"so Imma be a *good boy* and show some restraint. But, and I wanna say this as politely as I can, you are *way* too scared.\"\n\n\"Way too scared? That's my woman in there!\" \n\n\"Not just now. Always. I've served you espresso for over a year, I've heard you moan about all sorts of things. You're never *not* worried about something.\"\n\n\"Wait, you listen in on your customers?\" Nettie sounded affronted.\n\n\"You're with the most intriguing creature I know. That makes you interesting by proxy. But don't worry, normally I tune it out.\" He shrugged.\n\n\"Oh. My. I am so flattered,\" my best friend said dryly.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know I'm a creep. But I don't have the need to obsessively mother everyone around me. What are you afraid of, exactly? You think if you leave your friends out of your sight for longer than two seconds, they'll get rolled over by a bus or something?\"\n\n\"Frank,\" I growled. He hadn't posed the question in a malicious way, but he'd got closer to home than he'd likely bargained for. Nettie however didn't erupt like I'd expected. She dropped the hand that had previously dug into her hip and brought it up to pinch the bridge of her nose instead. \n\n\"Maybe,\" she said at length, slowly walking over to sit with us. She hesitantly scooted closer to the edge and stretched her legs so they were dangling down the overhang. With an unreadable expression in her deep, soulful eyes, she stared at the night sky. Silhouetted against the round moon, her gentle profile looked indescribably beautiful. For a long while, all four of us remained silent. \n\n\"Is there something wrong with wanting to take care of people?\" my savior human spoke up again. \"To protect them?\"\n\n\"If it eats you up inside, then yes,\" I replied without thinking. \"If you're neglecting yourself.\"\n\n\"If you treat them like kids and expect them not to question you,\" Elijah Carter added.\n\n\"Do I\u2026?\" Nettie's voice was soft and low. Not puzzled or undecided. She knew the answer. \n\nI freed one of my hands from under Frankie and reached out to her. She placed hers in mine almost instinctively. \"I love you,\" I said. \"I would be on my own if it weren't for you. I was before. Where I'm from, everyone was distant. You're everything my home was not, in a good way. I miss home, but you make it so it doesn't hurt as much. You make me glad I'm here.\"\n\nShe pulled our joint hands up, pressing my knuckles to her cheek. Hot tears landed on my skin. \"It's been so hard,\" she breathed. \"It's scary, I-I'm scared\u2014I try not to be, but I am, and I always was. Even before you came. This is just who I am. I need this. If I don't make sure they're safe, who will? Anything could happen, you know.\" She paused. \"Lord, now I'm rambling.\"\n\nFor a beat, we stayed silent. The boys didn't dare to say a single word. Frankie was stock-still in my lap. \"They'd be proud of you,\" I finally told her. \"I'm not sure I'm getting the breeder-larvae-dynamics of this world right, so pardon me if I don't, but I do think your parents would be immensely proud. If pride is the sentiment I'm looking for.\"\n\n\u201cI think so,\u201d Nettie whispered as she placed my hand back in my lap. \u201cThank you, Evangeline.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me, ever.\u201d \n\nShe sniffed, and Frankie wordlessly passed her a little pack of handkerchiefs. She dried her cheeks, then turned and asked me to check if her makeup was still on right. I said yes, to which she said she was glad she\u2019d picked a mascara that didn\u2019t run, to which Elijah commented on the degree of femininity of the conversation, to which we told him to shut up. Just then, we heard a sigh coming from behind us. \u201cLook at that, we got the entire Scooby gang.\u201d We turned to see that Mary Markov had come up behind us. In the distance, several cars were pulling up to the cliffside, agents hopping out and trickling down to the shore to secure the site of the cave-in. \n\nMary Markov smiled thinly. \u201cI shall never know peace. Or sleep, apparently. But I did promise I\u2019d do what I can so we broadcasted a storm warning to make everyone stay inside. You should be glad the locals are used to this.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very grateful for your assistance,\u201d my savior human said gamely, rising to offer a handshake. The newsreader\u2019s face softened as she accepted, her grin becoming a bit more genuine.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re about to witness a battle between deities, so this should be mildly interesting at least,\u201d she conceded, straightening her pencil skirt and gracefully lowering herself to the ground beside us. \u201cSome rules. No matter what we\u2019re about to see, we\u2019ll keep to the sidelines. There\u2019s no use in getting involved. For us, the forces at work here are unstoppable. So do not do anything stupid\u2026er.\u201d\n\nWe all told her we understood. And thus, we waited. Nettie and Mary began chatting and Frankie switched positions with me so I could lie back and nap a little. After half an hour of sitting on the overhang, Elijah said something about how burgers would be \u201cpretty great right now\u201d so he and I got up to go grab some from an out of town joint for the lot of us. Except the waiter, who apparently doesn\u2019t actually eat. I shelved that as one of the many things I wanted to ask him about at a more suitable point in time. \n\nThe streets were completely empty, so Elijah saw no problem in speeding. He seemed to rather enjoy racing his Chevy through the maze that was the town at night time, and I had to admit it was fun. We sped back, as well, hurrying to return to the others. The hour that followed was more pleasurable, the food helped take off some of our edge. My savior human even refrained from commenting on the nutritiousness of our late dinner. For a while, it was like there was nothing brewing on the horizon; like we were just out there stargazing. And then, after two whole hours, a roar as could only be produced by tons and tons of shifting water tore through the silence. \n\nThe five of us froze up in an instant. Elijah Carter\u2019s broad shoulders tensed as he leaned forward a little more. Nettie Peterson grabbed my lower arm with both hands as Mary Markov sucked in a sharp breath. Fran, whose spread legs I was sitting between, popped the bubble of his gum dangerously close to my ear. Mary hastily made a call to ensure every last one of her staff members had withdrawn from the beach and retreated to some point of elevation.\n\nShadowed against the bright full moon hanging low in the sky, far, far off in the distance, a wave began to build. A wall of water rose into the night sky, higher and higher as though it was aiming to meet with the stars themselves. Its sheer size was mind-boggling. Mary Markov jumped to her feet. \u201cWe need to get away from here! This thing is bound to roll back to sho\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cShore\u201d, she\u2019d probably been meaning to say, but her voice broke and trailed off when we saw the wave collapse, the water falling back down and revealing the form that had risen behind it. The gigantic woman that emerged from the depths was visible even in the nightly darkness. Out in the open, free from the confinement of the cave, I registered her actual, *true* size. She was even larger than I\u2019d thought. As she threw back her head and stretched her arms, it looked like she could have knocked the moon out of the sky. By some miracle, none of the masses of water she\u2019d shifted arrived at our beach, the tide licking at the sandy plain with only a little more rage than usual. \n\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Eli breathed, his eyes transfixed on the scene unfolding before us.\n\nFran snaked an arm around my waist from behind. \u201cEasy,\u201d he murmured into my ear, and it was only then that I realized that my body had practically turned to stone; every single one of my muscles having coiled up in horrified expectancy. However, when the ocean surface broke once again to make way for another creature to stand upright, even the waiter lost some of his composure. The newcomer straightened up to come face to face with the giant woman. He was just as enormous as her, but much, *much* less humanoid in shape. His back was arched, countless long, thin spikes jutting out from his bent, gnarled spine. Despite the distance between him and us, we could tell we were looking at something ancient. I don\u2019t know how to properly describe it\u2014somehow, an air of eternity seemed to radiate off of him. His long arms hung from sharp, bony shoulders, limp like yoke and unnaturally thin. \n\n\u201cOh my God.\u201d Nettie Peterson\u2019s voice came from right beside me, breathless and empty like the shock had knocked any other emotion out of her. \n\n\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d Mary began, only to falter and fumble for words. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen\u2026\u201d\n\nKit\u2019s mother reached out to him with both hands, her movements not slowed one bit by the masses of water around her as she lunged at the ancient one. She threw him over, and the two of them disappeared in an explosion of splashes and flying droplets. The impact sent massive waves whipping up and rolling towards the shore, but incredibly, they broke just before they could come crashing down upon us. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Kit!\u201d Nettie suddenly cried out, her fingers clamping down tighter on my arm. \u201cShe\u2019s keeping the flood away!\u201d Fear, pride and unabashed joy created a strange blend of inflections in her tone. \u201cShe\u2019s okay,\u201d she added in a husky whisper, gazing at the furiously tossing sea with milky eyes. I wordlessly reached over to rub her back. She was sitting ramrod straight, her entire body frozen and rock solid. \n\nThe waves cracked down like whips as the two giants reemerged. Kit\u2019s father had grabbed her mother by the neck, forcing her to back off. The two of them plowed a valley through the water as they moved, their huge bodies pushing away the masses on either side. My heart was pounding wildly, ice-cold dread knotting my stomach. *No, no, no\u2026* She could not be losing. She simply couldn't. \n\n\"What do you think is gonna happen if he beats her?\" Elijah Carter thought aloud. His voice was strained as taut wire.\n\nIt was then that I first considered the possibility of Kit's father taking revenge on the town. *Fuck.* I tried to chase the image of my first home being swallowed from my mind. \"She needs to win this,\" I breathed. \"There's no other way, she literally *has* to.\"\n\nAs if she'd heard me, Kit\u2019s mother suddenly grabbed her former mate\u2019s arms and tore them off her throat, only to then swing at him, causing him to stagger back. My chest felt close to bursting with relief when I saw him double over. The giantess didn\u2019t waste any time, lunging at him once more. She dug her hands into the skin of his midriff, pulling it apart in a crude tearing motion. A deafening howl of pain rode the waves to the shore this time, mingling with the rushing of water. One of my friends gagged audibly, but I was unable to take my eyes off the struggling pair. \n\nThe old giant\u2019s stomach burst, chunks of goo and thick fluids spewing out into all directions. He fell, closely followed by Kit\u2019s mother. She didn\u2019t let go of him, never once relinquishing her grip. Mercilessly tugging on his back spikes, his arms and the flaps of flayed flesh, she dragged him under. Both of them were swallowed by the sea, the waves coming up to envelop them with a loud clap. \n\nAll was silent for several seconds. \n\nNeither my friends nor I said a single word. I\u2019m almost certain none of us did so much as breathe. Then, from before us, a murmur seemed to arise from the ocean, whispers like hissing undercurrents or babbling streams reaching our ears. And from the quieting tide that was calmly playing at the stretch of dry land below us emerged another figure. A human-appropriate size, leanly muscled, distinctly familiar. \n\nNettie Peterson let out a yelp as she sprang to her feet. \n\nThe woman drew closer, effortlessly stepping over the rocks and rubble in her path and striding up the hill before she finally came to stand before us. Her long blue hair was soaked, the smell of salt clinging to her even as the barnacles, seashells and starfish fell off her skin.\n\n\u201cAyo, Tom\u2019s Diner,\u201d she said, her voice heavy with an unfamiliar gravity. Frankie Preston perked up. \u201cYou got a knife on you, you little creep?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know I do,\u201d he replied gamely, reaching into his pocket to pull out a switchblade and tossing it to her.\n\nShe snatched it out of the air, then bunched up her waterfall of hair, wrapping it around her wrist as close to her head as she could before severing it in quick, successive cuts. As it fell, it liquefied and hit the ground with a splash. Rearing her head, a familiar smile unfurled on her face\u2014part triumphant, part cocky and part moronic. \n\nMostly moronic.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13dr5g0/help_im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[2:

It wasn't until I isolated myself from everyone I once knew or thought I knew that I realized how much worry and grief and anger and resentment that drowned my insides every day. And most of those emotions weren't even mine to feel. It was like I thought if I took on that grief and hatred and anger from the people I loved that they'd be a bit lighter. So many things have happened to me in my life and my mantra has always been \"Its good that this is happening to me because I can survive it\". \n\nI often have wondered.. did I take on all of those things out of the goodness of my heart.. or did I do it because I hated myself so much that I constantly pushed myself to the brinks of death and insanity that I thought I deserved it. \n\nI have isolated myself almost entirely for the last 2 years. I've learned how to be happy alone. My partner got high and walked onto a dark, busy southern California freeway in 2021, all because I wouldn't come get him and take him back. I don't know when or if I'll ever be ready to accept people back into my life again. \n\nI'm only a year or two older than Nettie and though our lives have been drastically different, her and I are still human... and, I hope beyond hope that Nettie doesn't become what I have. I hope that she learns how to share the weight of the world. She's really lucky to have you and everyone else.",

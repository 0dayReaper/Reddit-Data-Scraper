Maybe a fortnight since that first [Sauna Club](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13lnhu2/sauna_club_part_one/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). \n  \nA week after that was the whirlwind of events that changed my life beyond recognition. \n  \nThe day that [Andy went missing](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13mlx1n/sauna_club_part_2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) &amp; the night in which I came so close\u2026so damn close to [saving Jen\u2019s life](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13nn16j/sauna_club_part_3/).\n  \n\n  \nAll I wanted to do was lose a bit of weight\u2026and now I have. I\u2019ve nearly shed everything in my life that was weighing me down.\n  \nAfter today you won\u2019t be hearing from me again. \n  \nI\u2019m truly sorry. \n  \n\n  \nThe morning after Jen died I woke up in a state of shock. Standing up I had to peel myself from the bedsheets. My back was a mess of burst blisters and pustulated skin. The rest of my body was pink all over except my feet. They were black\u2026The soles looked like dried lava, charred to a crisp but with dark red veins cutting through. And for how hideously burned I looked I was freezing. My teeth wouldn\u2019t stop chattering.\n  \n\u201cLook at you\u201d I\u2019d wheezed at my reflection. Even my voice was wrecked. That world had stolen everything from me. But it didn\u2019t matter. I\u2019d get it back. \n  \n\n  \nI called my wife and told her that I\u2019d just tested positive for Covid.\n  \n\u201cYou sound terrible Mike\u201d She\u2019d said with a sigh, but she didn\u2019t really care. \n  \n\u201cI feel terrible. Maybe you should stay away a few days until I\u2019m in the clear?\u201d\n  \n\u201cYou sure?\u201d feigning sympathy\u2026her trademark. \n  \n\u201cYeah\u2026I\u2019ll be fine. Call you when I\u2019m on the mend.\u201d I hung up then. The first time in my life I\u2019d ever cut her off. I didn\u2019t really care what she had to say any more. My heart beat for someone else now. Only Lydia and I understood the truth of this world, and that strange world beyond. I\u2019d made her a promise. I was going to finish my sauna and together we\u2019d go back.\n  \n\n  \nI spent the rest of that day googling, watching youtube videos and chatting with strangers on reddit about how to put the finishing touches to my sauna.\n  \nThe next day I left my house for the hardware store. \n  \nI hadn\u2019t realised how much people would stare\u2026gasp even when they saw the ruins of my skin. At least I was finally losing weight though. Nothing fit any more. The steam in that world was washing me away. I didn\u2019t care. Soon I\u2019d have Lydia by my side and then what would anyone else\u2019s judgement matter. \n  \nFinishing the sauna took the best part of a week. I\u2019ve never been a practical guy. In that week I heard more from Lydia than my wife. She checked in daily to see how I was getting on and when we\u2019d be ready to return to that world of fire and fate. \n  \nI insulated the small wooden shed as best I could so that it would contain the heat and smoke, built a small fire bin to contain the coals, bought a bucket for the water, 2 small benches and a sand timer for the wall. I roughly laydown paving and put in a grate for drainage. \n  \nIt wasn\u2019t much to look at, but it would do the job. For days I soaked the wood until the whole thing was saturated enough not to go up in flames with us inside the moment I sparked the coals.\n  \nAnd then last night I text Lydia to say we were good to go. \n  \n\n  \nAn hour or so later she arrived. For a moment she stood on the doorstep staring at me and I had no idea what she was thinking. It wasn\u2019t the same face of shock and disgust that everyone else gave me now but\u2026something else\u2026Something that makes more sense now. \n  \nShe was changed too. \n  \nShe had been so bloodied the last time we left the Sauna. Bleeding from a hundred scratches all over. She had healed but the scars were everywhere. She was no longer the perfect blond gym girl I\u2019d met two weeks ago\u2026she was better\u2026she was mine. \n  \nI knew that it was cheating the first time I laid eyes on her, the first time she\u2019d touched my leg. What difference would it make if we fucked in my marital bed? So we did. \n  \nAs we lay there afterwards I traced my fingers along the scars on her perfect body and wished that it was her I\u2019d married\u2026her that was pregnant\u2026carrying MY baby. \n  \nIt was then we heard the car pull up on the driveway. My wife was home. \n  \n\u201cI\u2019ll meet you out there\u201d I said calmly. Lydia nodded and left the bedroom making her way towards my sauna. I wanted my wife to catch her in the kitchen\u2026to see her naked body and KNOW that both of us could fuck up this marriage if we wanted to. \n  \nBut Lydia managed to slip out of the house just as my wife arrived. \n  \n\u201cMike?\u201d she whispered tentatively in the kitchen \u201cWhose car is that?\u201d\n  \n\u201cI\u2019ve got a friend round. We\u2019re trying out the sauna.\u201d\n  \n\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t have-\u201d she flicked the kitchen light on and gasped as she caught sight of my face. \n  \n\u201cWHAT THE FUCK?\u201d She screamed. The state of my burnt swollen face bringing tears to her eyes, whatever love she still had left for me draining away. That was fine. Whatever love I had for her had died on the backseat of my car. \n  \nI looked at her swollen bump and knew we were finished. \n  \n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you tomorrow. I\u2019m busy now\u201d I said coldly and I could see my words rattled her. She didn\u2019t recognise me any more. I hardly recognised myself. \n  \n\u201cWhat happened?\u201c she kept repeating and I just shrugged. \n  \n\u201cGo to bed.\u201d For the first time in my life she actually listened to me. She slipped away into the dark of our room and closed the bedroom door. Too scared and disgusted to be around me any longer. \n  \nI took off my robe and followed Lydia out into the garden. If she was worried about the state of my DIY sauna she didn\u2019t say anything. She didn\u2019t say anything at all. We both knew why we were here and what had to happen next. \n  \nSpin the sand timer. \n  \nA ladle for each of us. \n  \nAnd then the smoke engulfed us. I was surprised at how well this small hotbox shed was working. In the back of my mind I thought that maybe the magic wouldn\u2019t follow us here. That maybe I\u2019d missed a step or that maybe the whole thing would just go up in flames. \n  \nBut it worked. \n  \nI was alone travelling through that thin film of white heat that separated our world from the sauna place. Perhaps that was the nature of the ritual: That it has worked for so many people throughout the centuries if you have the fire in you and believe. \n  \nAs I waited for the smoke to clear I tried to hold in my mind why I was coming to this dangerous world once more. \n  \nFor Lydia \u2013 to find out what kept her coming back here again and again and what it was that was tearing apart her body. \n  \nFor Andy \u2013 to find out what had happened to him and why he now seemed to belong to this place. \n  \nFor myself \u2013 To steal something, anything\u2026some divine knowledge from this place as vengeance for Jen. And get away with it.\n  \n\n  \nThe smoke cleared and I knew we\u2019d arrived. It was different though, in all the ways I thought it would be. Just like the Sauna in the gym had become a warped reflection of itself, so had my DIY shed. The only difference was the door to the outside world. There was no poolside view, no horrible visions of those watchers and their nets, just the sound of a ruined world rushing by and screams. So many screams. Through them all I could hear the voice of Jen. \n  \n\u2018HELP\u2026PLEASE HELP MIKE. THEY\u2019RE HURTING ME.\u2019 Her old voice cried endlessly. This place had already tricked me once though...so I turned my back to the door. \n  \n\n  \nLydia was already several steps up and about to leave. \n  \n\u201cLydia wait\u201d I wanted to stop her so we could come up with a plan for how we would manage this visit \u201cI want to help you.\u201d\n  \nLydia gave me a weird smile that I couldn\u2019t read and with a shrug she disappeared into one of the corridors.\n  \n\u201cWait!\u201d I called again and followed her up a few steps not knowing why she would just leave like that\u2026\n  \nI could feel again how different this place was. The gym steps had been hot but still had a smooth varnish finish. These steps were rough and splintered. I starred into the corridor and gulped. Remembering what had happened last time I faced this gauntlet alone. There was no sign of Lydia and the corridor was dark but I set off anyway. I\u2019d found Jen, I could find Lydia. \n  \nThe tunnel twisted and turned, with more tributaries than last time, more maze like. Stairs leading up and down, passages to crawl through or clamber over, tight spaces to squeeze into and long painful drops. \n  \nThe passage forked and forked and forked and at each junction I had to guess at the right direction but in truth I was lost and all the while the steams grew thicker around me, until it was like I was wading through them. \n  \nThen I heard the sound. \n  \nA sort of rhythmic creaking and groaning and a woman gasping. I realised that it was coming from the passage parallel to me. Like how Andy had helped me before\u2026\n  \nThe sound grew louder and then multiplied. Another groan coming from below me\u2026and then another to the right. \n  \nI pushed my face the slats and tried to peer through to see the cause of the noise but in my heart I already knew. I knew that groan and that voice\u2026and I\u2019m man enough to know the tell-tale sound of creaky springs and a rickety bedframe. \n  \nIt was my wife. \n  \nAnd when I peered through the gap I could see myself and her wrapped up in each others arms. Some how on the other side of this wall was my bedroom at university and I was seeing into the past. I was seeing the first time the two of us had sex. It was drunk and fumbling but even then I\u2019d known she was special. \n  \nI moved to the other side of the room and through the slats saw a different past. Our honeymoon suit and the sex we\u2019d had there. \n  \nI pulled away, confused why the mists were showing me this\u2026 things I already knew to be true. Below my feet I could hear more sounds, more groans more pleasure\u2026but less familiar to me. Sounds of enjoyment that I\u2019d never made my wife elicit. I ducked down into the swirling mists that had gathered around my waist and crawled on my belly across the wooden floor. I pressed my eye down to the slat, dangerously close to the splinters and peered until I could see the shapes writhing. \n  \nMy wife and\u2026\n  \nMy brother. The two of them pounding away in my bedroom. In my bed. \n  \nI wrenched away, unable to watch it, gasping\u2026and as I gasped I felt hot white tendrils of smoke crawl down my throat.\n  \nThere were so many new sounds to hear\u2026all across the floor before me\u2026more pockets of sound and I couldn\u2019t help myself. I crawled on, listening at each new noise and then seeking out the shape of the next man who would make me a cuckold. \n  \nMy wife and her boss.\n  \nMy wife and a man I\u2019d never seen before. \n  \nAnother stranger\n  \nAnd another. \n  \nEach time I gasped\u2026each time sucked in more white heat.\n  \nI stood up gasping for air. If these visions were true\u2026how many other men had my wife slept with? I\u2019d known in my heart for a while that the child she was carrying wasn\u2019t mine but\u2026I thought always thought that in this place I might find out who the father was and have satisfaction in that\u2026have revenge with that knowledge but\u2026\n  \nDid she even know? In her nights out in the town, night after night she made a joke of me. A joke of our vows. \n  \nDid she even care who the father was, so long as it wasn\u2019t me! How little satisfaction did I give her that she would fuck ANYONE. \n  \nI wretched and thin coil of steam coiled out of my mouth and into the world. \n  \nHow long had I been here? Breathing in these mists. \n  \nThis place was getting inside me. \n  \nClouding my judgement.\n  \nThis room had broken my heart and given me no satisfaction\u2026Only more doubt, more betrayal, more confusion\u2026more resolve to find Lydia. To save Lydia and start my future anew with her. \n  \nI pushed on blindly down tunnel after tunnel, hell bent on finding her before the time ran out. \n  \n\u201cMIKE!\u201d Lydia\u2019s voice screaming, loud, hurt and close by. \n  \n\u201cKeep calling Lydia\u2026I\u2019m coming. I\u2019ll find you\u201d \n  \nShe did \u201cMike, Mike, Mike\u201d as rhythmic as the groans of my cheating wife. Finally I turned a corner and found her. \n  \nLydia lay with her back against the wall of a terracotta chamber. The sight of room not made of wood took me aback. \n  \nI ran to her. \n  \nDeep gashes covered her body, like something had sliced deep into her arms and legs and across her stomach. I couldn\u2019t bear to look but I knew that the gauges were dangerously deep. Lydia was bleeding more than a human body could take. \n  \n\u201cWhat happened!\u201d My eyes tried to take in the room quickly looking for the source of the danger, seeking out an attacker in the darkness. My brain remembering what Lydia had said the first time we\u2019d come here. \u201cEvery maze has its minotaurs.\u201d\n  \n\u201cMy brother Mike\u2026I came here to get him back.\u201d Lydia spoke slowly, her words slurred and woozy.\n  \n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I cradled her, not knowing which gash to try to stem.\n  \n\u201cDead\u2026he died so young\u2026my piece of shit dad\u2026\u201d the thoughts tumbled out of her mouth erratically \u201cBut I can get him back\u2026I just need to\u2026feed the flames\u2026\u201d. Lydia raised an arm to point at a large black pit in the middle of the room. \n  \nI\u2019d ignored it at first, taking it for just another one of the sauna\u2019s coal pits, but this one seemed different. Set into the stone work of the floor and surrounded by a selection of craftman\u2019s tools: pliers, hammers, blades, tongs, scalpels, ancient looking drills. Rudimental but efficient and delicately laid out on a piece of linen.\n  \nThis was a Smiths room, and in the centre was the furnace. The coals inside blazed but they weren\u2019t black\u2026they were a crimson red, and they throbbed like organs\u2026and they seemed to be swimming in a small pool of-\n  \nI heard a crack and then I felt the pain that belonged to it and collapsed to the floor. \n  \nI looked down and saw that my knee was no longer where it should be. \n  \nLydia had a mallet in her hand that I\u2019d some how missed before and with a violent twist she had stroke me across the leg. Now she was trying to push herself to standing above me. \n  \n\u201cBut I can\u2019t give the fire all the ingredients it needs\u2026not alone\u2026I\u2019ve been feeding it blood\u2026every time\u2026but\u2026I can\u2019t give it my bones\u2026my skin\u2026my eyes\u2026I can\u2019t give it that and still be there to love him\u2026to love him in all the ways that SOME ONE SHOULD HAVE\u201d Lydia screamed and the words echoed down the corridor. \n  \nHer body shook with the exertion and every time her muscles clenched a fresh squirt of blood oozed from her wounds. There was a mad glint in her eyes\n  \nI understood now. \n  \nI understood why someone as beautiful as her had been showing an interest in a fat idiot like me. She\u2019d just been fattening me up for the slaughter. \n  \nShe didn\u2019t love me. Just like my wife\u2026I was just another useful stooge to her. \n  \nFor a moment I lay there, waiting for the mallet to come down on my head\u2026I thought about just rolling over and letting the fire pit have me. At least in death I could be useful to someone. At least Lydia would get her brother back\u2026 \n  \nThen a fury rolled across me, a rage I never knew I had inside. Like all the mists I\u2019d swallowed were bubbling up inside me and I decided then that I didn\u2019t want to die. \n  \nNot yet.\n  \n\u201cFuck you.\u201d I grabbed the nearest implement to me and flung it at Lydias head as hard as I could. The pliers caught her in the temple with a hard crack and I watched her teeter backwards towards the furnace. She caught her balance on the very edge and as she wobbled I saw a long dribble of blood cascade from the cuts in her arms and into the fire pit. The cloud of red mist exploded into the room curls of crimson smoke snaked their way upwards like tentacles. \n  \nStanding was harder than I\u2019d anticipated with my knee on the wrong side of my leg, but I had no choice. Not if I wanted to live. Leaning hard against the wall I stumbled away as quickly as I could. Back out into the corridors and away through the maze, with no mind on getting back just getting away! \n  \nI paused when I reached the first crossroads. Breathing hard and checking behind me to see if Lydia was following but there was no sign of her. \n  \nI leaned against a wall trying to catch my breath and wondered if there was a way I could set my knee. \n  \nThe blade entered my back and I don\u2019t know how deep it travelled before I realised what was happening. I peeled myself off the skewer and turned around. Through the slats in the wall I could make out Lydia on the other side. She had stabbed through the partition with a long ceremonial blade.\n  \n\u201cCome back to the room Mike. I can fuck you while you die?\u201d\n  \nI blinked in disbelief and pain, trying to work out whether she had already killed me\u2026\n  \n\u201cIt was going to be Sak\u2026that fucking himbo\u2026but he went and killed himself before I could\u201d Lydia let out a weird little giggle. \u201cSo it\u2019ll just have to be you\u2026come on Mike\u2026Look at you\u2026you\u2019ve got plenty of body to spare\u2026do something good for once in your life and die\u2026die so my brother can live.\u201d Lydia plunged the sword again through the slats as hard and fast as she could and the tip buried itself in my gut. Shallow, but enough to hurt. \n  \nThe sword was long and could reach me through the wall. I had to run. \n  \nThis time Lydia was following. Alternating between screaming and laughing. Matching me step for step on the other side of the wall. Periodically she would thrust the sword again, opening up a new nick on my body, but her aim was bad. Neither of us could move quickly\u2026both of us were bloodied and hurt as we moved down the corridors. \n  \nI thanked the stars for this small wall between us but was already wondering what I\u2019d do if these corridors merged? If I rounded a corner and found myself face to face with the girl I had once loved\u2026who had now become the very minotaur I\u2019d most feared. Could I kill her before she killed me? Did I have that in me\u2026\n  \nThe corridor forked the other way and my relief was immeasurable. I ran and found Lydia\u2019s voice growing fainter away from me. I ran, ignoring the grating sensation in my leg and the blood pumping out of my back. \n  \nI ran until I found myself back in the chamber where this all began. I ran so quickly that I couldn\u2019t stop myself. I stepped out and realised that there was nothing below my foot apart from a cavernous drop down to the stone floor below. A bone breaking drop that would have proved fatal were in not for the arm that grabbed me. \n  \nI dangled for a moment\u2026one foot out over the abyss before the person pulled me backwards. \n  \nBefore I could thank my saviour  I heard Lydia\u2019s voice again and my blood froze. \n  \n\u201cPlease Mike\u2026no one will ever love you like I do\u2026Who else would want to fuck that flabby burnt body of yours\u2026please? Let\u2019s be broken together\u2026\u201d Lydias voice fluttered down from the end of the tunnel and I realised she had caught up with me. \n  \nHer body came exploding out of the mists as she charged at me like a bull\u2026the ceremonial blade outstretched and ready to run me through. \n  \nI was too tired to save my life any more but again the hand pulled me backwards in the nick of time. \n  \nThe sword carved through the spot where I had been standing moments before, followed by Lydia\u2026her momentum carrying her over the edge. I could see the shock on her face as she realised there was no more floor and then she fell. Down past the arena like steps on all sides\u2026a drop that there was no surviving. Her head bounced on the penultimate step and her spine curved around until she kicked herself in the face and then the jumbled mess that had once been Lydia crashed to the floor. \n  \nThe crunch was terrible, even from up here.\n  \nI peered out over the ledge at the ruined remains of Lydia\u2019s once perfect body.\n  \n\u201cMuh\u2026Mi\u2026ke\u2026mmmm\u2026Miiiii\u2026.Mike. Mike\u2026Muh\u201d the sound drifted up\u2026as her mouth moved and the remnant of her brain tried to make a final thought. Her limbs were contorted at impossible angles, bones poking through the skin, a shattered wreck. It seemed cruel that the universe would so thoroughly break something that had once been so beautiful. Lydia was now a twitching blob, just waiting for death to take her.\n  \nAnd it did. \n  \nAs I watched the door to the sauna opened and in walked one of those cloaked watchers. The sight of them struck a fear in me. I didn\u2019t realise they could come in here\u2026I had thought that this world would keep us safe from them\u2026but it had no interest in me. \n  \nThe watcher entered, hand in hand with a small boy\u2026a child no older than 5 years old\u2026with the same sandy blonde hair and mousey features as his sister. \n  \nThe boy looked up at me for a moment and the same look of mad hatred that Lydia had given me crossed his little features. Then his hand made contact with the coal pit and he was gone. Back to the living world. Lydia had got what she\u2019d always wanted\u2026but it had cost her everything. \n  \nThe watcher scooped up her decimated body, her mouth still uselessly trying to make words, her eyes desperately roaming around the room\u2026still not certain that she was dead. \n  \nThe watcher took her all the same. Out and away through that exit that didn\u2019t belong to us\u2026out into a sandstorm of red winds beyond\u2026and then the door closed and Lydia was no more.\n  \n\n  \nAndy touched me gently on the arm and with a sad nod began to climb up and away. \n  \nI watched him go\u2026I hadn\u2019t seen him properly in a fortnight, but he looked so different. \n  \nOlder. Less sinewy\u2026and more barrel like. Somehow more\u2026stately. There was no mistaking that it was Andy, but he was no longer the retiree that took care of his body\u2026he had someone how become one of the sad ailing old men who spend their lives basting themselves and cooking in a\u2026\n  \nHe looked like a roman emperor\n  \n\u201cAre you coming?\u201d He said in a voice that had changed as well. The cheeky fun all gone and replaced with a strange solemnity. \n  \n\u201cComing where?\u201d\n  \n\u201cUp\u201d Andy smiled.\n  \n\u201cWhat\u2019s up there?\u201d I asked dumbly.\n  \n\u201cA group of men\u2026much like me\u2026we sit and chat\u2026and watch the world go by. But we really see it Mike. We see it all\u2026this world, and more\u2026their pasts, presents and futures\u2026we sit at the top of the sauna and we pass our judgements and where we can\u2026we help.\u201d Andy looked at me sadly \u201cwe try our best. You\u2019ve lost so much Mike\u2026so much weight\u2026there\u2019s barely anything tethering you down any more\u2026you\u2019ve done well. There\u2019s a seat up there for you. If you want it.\u201d\n  \nI stood. Not knowing what to do or say\u2026I tried to picture the summit. The top of this upside down pyramid of steps and the committee of fat old men who sat there. \n  \nA group of men who had stepped out of time to stare down into the mists below and see the world go by. A ring of men with wrinkled skin and withered dicks. \n  \nIs that what I wanted to become?\n  \n\u201cCan I think about it?\u201d\n  \n\u201cOf course.\u201d Andy smiled \u201cyou know where to find us.\u201d And up he went\u2026away into the darkness. \n  \n\n  \nI went back down, down to the coals even though the timer had long since run out. \n  \nI touched the coals and found myself in my home DIY sauna again\u2026the walls and ceiling on fire\u2026Lydias corpse on the floor, burning away gently, and clutched in her hand that long ceremonial blade, beginning to glow red.\n  \nI left quickly and closed the door behind me.\n  \nSmoke billowed into the night air as my Sauna turned into a bonfire.\n  \n\n  \nAnd now I\u2019m here. Letting you know how all this ends. \n  \nI think I\u2019ve got another few more moments before my little sauna collapses\u2026enough time to spin a timer one last time, pour a ladle on what remains of the coal pit and get back to that other world\u2026\n  \nI\u2019ve been on the bottom of life for so long\u2026just another one of you fucking losers and I\u2019ve had enough. I\u2019m going to join the men who sit at the top\u2026those men who sit in judgement on all things\u2026\n  \nBut before I go back I\u2019m going to pass judgement here. My unfaithful wife is still asleep in the room next door and now\u2026 she\u2019ll never wake\u2026her nor the bastard inside her. \n  \nI\u2019ll have my revenge on her for\u2026and all the women who tried to take from me. \n  \nLydia\u2019s ceremonial sword is still hot on my lap\u2026I\u2019ll wake her just before I do it. I want to see the look in her eyes.\n  \nAll I wanted to do was lose a bit of weight\u2026and she\u2019s the last thing to go.",

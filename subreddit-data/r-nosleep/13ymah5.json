    "postText": "My name is Canopy Hydrangea. I recover cursed artifacts, explore haunted places, and report back the information needed to the people I work for. The Company then arranged what has to be done to remove these blemishes from the world.\n\nIf it isn't possible, we make sure the evil of cursed artifacts and bizarre places doesn\u2019t make it\u2019s way to the general public.\n\nBut sometimes, it\u2019s important to leak a report or two to the unsuspecting public. Makes for a good warning- and this particular file is one of many that must be known.\n\n\u201cDo you have clearance?\u201d asked a young man, hat with a carefully embroidered VII obscuring his face. He held out a little notepad with tables for signatures labeled \u2018sign-ins and security\u2019. \u201cWe can\u2019t have anyone here without proper clearance.\u201d\n\nI sighed and took the pen that was attached to the pad. \u201cOf course I have clearance,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m the one supposed to be in charge of this damn operation.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in confusion. So did I. I was told by the Company\u2019s board members this specific location was assigned to me. And yet, my team was clearly not the first ones there.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t what we were promised. Not by a long stretch. \u201cI was told Varaluz was in charge.\u201d he pointed over to a bulkier man in camouflage gear, director agents of the Company around the dig site.\n\nVaraluz. Of course he was here- he was always getting in people\u2019s business. \u201cAm I being subjected to an internal security probe?\u201d I looked him in the eye. \u201cRight now? Right here?\u201d\n\nThe meek young man hesitated and backed away. \u201cSee, your previous assignment against the House of Lorreno has some of us in the Company\u2026\u201d he chose his words carefully, \u201cdoubting your status.\u201d\n\nThis was no issue. I just wanted control of the dig site back in my hands- after all, I was the one sent to study it. And my team. \u201cNo problem.\u201d\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about the dig site. The mass grave that, as I was told by my historian Kyran, contained the corpses of over 200 skeletons, and counting. \u201c254,\u201d he mused, counting again. \u201cAnd some aren\u2019t human.\u201d\n\nI asked him about it. And then I saw the bones for myself.\n\nThey, at first, looked like the bones of children. But on closer inspection found them all to be distinctly serrated. Their skulls were a bit too flat and wide to truly be human, and what was more bizarre were the limbs.\n\nEach non-human remain had eight limbs, all that seemed like the legs and feet of ordinary human body; obviously inhuman, and the way they were connected told me this wasn\u2019t some post-mortem ritual that positioned the bodies like so after death.\n\nNo. This was the real deal- dozens of dead, non-human entities that perplexed and sent chills up my spine.\n\nAnd the skulls. The damn skulls were like they were smiling, of all things. And instead of two eye sockets there were four.\n\nI also noted the sharp pines of wood that impaled the skeletons. \u201cWhat\u2019s with that?\u201d Even before asking the aura of something\u2026 powerful emanated from the bones.\n\nMy assistant, Rainie, had an answer. \u201cWe suspect they may not be fully dead,\u201d she informed. \u201cWe\u2019re doing our best not to er, dislodge the wood until we can get a priest to put them at rest.\u201d\n\nI knelt down near one of the many impaled creatures and observed it. Distinct markings were present. I took off a glove off and touched it, feeling the history within it.\n\nSparks of violence. War. Famine. An ember of something not entirely dark I could not place. It unnerved me. \u201cHow long until we can put them at rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we haven\u2019t figured out what religion this place aligns to,\u201d she pointed out. This was true- if we invited the wrong priest to bless the place it could invoke the opposite of peaceful rest. \u201cAnd you haven\u2019t even seen the staircase.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe what?\u201d\n\nThe mass grave was discovered by an oil company looking to drill new ground. When the reports of the unusual remains came in, a report was handed over to me and my team, and we were sent to eliminate the disturbance, remove all evidence of the bizarre and hand it back over to the oilmen.\n\nThe bodies were found in concentric trenches, squares. There were about five, each within another, and a sixth being uncovered by the dig team.\n\nIn the center of the squares was a small ruin, a large jutting cylinder with a door. Beyond this door was a spiral staircase of stone, seemingly cut in by the ancient builders of the grave site so many centuries ago.\n\nVaraluz, the internal security inspector, awaited me there. \u201cCanopy,\u201d he greeted, extending a hand. He peered into the staircase, holding out strong, twisted rope. \u201cWe\u2019ve got four assets who\u2019ll be out just about-\u201d a man, panicked, rope attached to his waist scrambled out, hyperventilating.\n\nHe was in standard prison garb. As usual- we often used death row prisoners to explore new, dangerous territory.\n\nHe started to ramble about a shape in the darkness, and something about pages and a book. \u201cSir,\u201d asked a woman, placing the man under handcuffs. \u201cWhat should we do with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cRemove him,\u201d Varaluz ordered.\n\nShe looked at both of us, puzzled. \u201cLike, kill him?\u201d\n\nVaraluz shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly- we need to know what he saw down there- extract his memories, then have the handlers do what they please.\u201d\n\nYuck.\n\nMemory extraction was something I hated to see. A needle laced with symbols and science, injected into the center of the eye. It would then extract memories to be read by a rather interesting-looking book.\n\nThe prisoner would then develop amnesia for a while, but that was no issue. The prisoners we worked with for these excursions were often terrible, irredeemable people.\n\nVaraluz and his team informed me of what they had discovered, just as three Company agents entered the depths, rope tied along their waists.\n\nThe staircase was seemingly endless, according to two other excursion teams they had sent into the depths.\n\nThe first team had only been equipped by a radio and led by an agent of the Company, but after an hour dropped from radio contact. After another hour, they should have returned- yet they had vanished into the depths.\n\nA rescue operation was made- equipped with rope, Varaluz sent in a team of prisoners led by a more experienced agent into the depths.\n\nOddly enough, the initial agent leader stumbled back out, informing us the passage had shifted, and they had across a labyrinth underneath the entire dig site- some sort of temple.\n\nVideo footage revealed the place was a hellhole. There were signs of life, but twisted, impossible things- strange fungal matter and the bones of long dead creatures- and something else, still active.\n\nThis active entity, according to the survivor, seemed to work in tandem with the stairway, dislodging stairs, sending one prisoner falling into the abyss. Another was seemingly sucked into the walls of the place.\n\nThe last simply faded, and that was when the agent started to evacuate.\n\nThe rescue team came back, fully intact. They hadn\u2019t encountered nay such temple, merely more of the same: staircases, illuminated by the light to be made of bone.\n\nSubsequent testing informed us the bones were human.\n\n\u201cOkay, I want-\u201d as soon as I was about to say I wanted to enter the staircase the line snapped. \u201cWhoa!\u201d\n\nVaraluz held on, and two agents joined him. \u201cIt\u2019s being- pulled!\u201d he turned to me.\n\nI retreated to a machine the rope was connected to and selected a button labeled \u2018retract\u2019. \u201cThis should-\u201d it started to pull against whatever was on the other end- but it was straining, \u201cwork.\u201d\n\nThe machine started to creak, and the bulky thing began to move against itself. \u201cSecurity!\u201d Varaluz ordered. \u201cGet the hell over here- now!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when the line loosened and pulled back, and blood came flying from the abyss. Two bodies- no- a torso and a set of legs, rope still attached flew out, nearly splattering us with blood.\n\nA man came running out, splattered in the blood of his friends. \u201cThere\u2019s something down there-\u201d he said it with such fear I started what lurked in the shadows, \u201cit- it was like those bones!\u201d\n\nA growl emerged from deep within. My assistant, Rainie came up to me. \u201cSir, should we seal it up?\u201d she gestured to security, already prepared to request explosives.\n\nI thought about this for a moment. \u201cNot yet, no,\u201d I decided. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if sealing it up will work.\u201d\n\nWhatever was inside- it was powerful. So I decided we needed a proper operation into the temple. With actual agents. \u201cRainie,\u201d I began, \u201chave the rest of the team meet me here- we\u2019re going in.\u201d\n\nReckless? Maybe. But if what was inside was a threat to humanity- it needed to be neutralized, captured, and sealed away. \u201cBy the way,\u201d she started, \u201cwe\u2019ve identified the ruin.\u201d\n\nMy eyes lit up. \u201cCan we get a priest?\u201d The sooner we could remove the undead bones from the site the safer I\u2019d feel.\n\n\u201cAlready have one,\u201d she hesitated. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBut?\u201d\n\nShe sighed and pointed to the outskirts, where a rather fancy motorcycle had arrived. \u201cIt\u2019s Quincy Kieni.\u201d\n\nQuincy Kieni was a rather eccentric figure in the cursed artifact black market. He was both an asset, working for us, telling us the details of when a major deal would go down- and an enemy.\n\nHis faith to Calayu, the Salamander King made him have so called \u2018prophecies\u2019 over when to help us and when to suddenly disappear off the grid.\n\nI made a noise somewhere between a grunt and a sigh of annoyance. \u201cOf course it\u2019s him.\u201d I watched as the man with black tinted glasses and fiery red hair waltz about the gravesite, raising his hands up and dancing.\n\nWithin the hour my team was ready.\n\nI, Canopy Hydrangea would lead them in, coordinate our actions. My expertise in psychically sensing the bizarre would come in handy, if it need be, and the few spells I\u2019d learned.\n\nThen there was Rainie- my assistant, who had reviewed the tapes and studied all too many places similar to this. Of course, there was Kyran, my main security guy, and today, we would be joined by the rather annoying Quincy.\n\nThere were others, but I didn\u2019t want to lead a large team.\n\nSo we entered the depths. Varaluz attached a rope to us, connecting it to the large bulky machine in case something attempted to pull us in. And then we were set, and so we began the journey into the depths of the pit.\n\n\u201cCanopy, we meet again!\u201d Quincy cheered. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were in the business of exploring new and exciting places.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I thought you\u2019d finally gotten yourself killed for good,\u201d I chided. \u201cAfter the whole Stet\u2019Kai incident.\u201d\n\nHe laughed maniacally at that, and the noise reverberated around the walls. \u201cWere you demoted as a result of, who were they?\u201d he thought. \u201cLorreno\u2019s team?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of your business,\u201d Kyran cut in. He held up a hand. \u201cI hear something.\u201d\n\nWe all silenced ourselves- even the bothersome Quincy. There was a dull growl in the background, and the clicking of insects- no- \u201cAutomata,\u201d Rainie identified. \u201cTemples of the Salamander have automaton.\u201d\n\nMachines given life through ancient magic. Not a huge problem.\n\nThe next hour was rather boring, and we continued in silence, fearing disturbing one of the more dangerous security automata. Sure, machines weren\u2019t as dangerous as any live creatures- but still a threat nonetheless.\n\n\u201cHold it!\u201d Quincy shouted. We all stopped. He stepped ahead and knelt down, inspecting the step in front of me. He spoke something I couldn\u2019t understand, and symbols appeared, and we heard the clicking of gears. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic pitfall trap.\u201d\n\nI remembered Varaluz\u2019s prisoners. The story about the place working against them. \u201cWho,\u201d Rainie posited, \u201cbuilt this place?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a Temple of the Salamander,\u201d I reminded. \u201cBut those bones up there don\u2019t match anything we have on record.\u201d\n\nQuincy ordered another stop, and chanted- and a wall beside us faded away, revealing a hallway. \u201cNow that\u2019s the temple.\u201d\n\nI noted the images and statues, \u201cAnd I think I know who built this place.\u201d\n\nSatyrs. The statues were satyrs, half-man half-goat creatures spotted throughout mythology and ancient times. We knew them, life many other of the ancient kinds, to be extinct.\n\nLong dead. But the statues of the Satyrs here seemed different, more human than beast somehow. They lined the hall, facing away from us, bowing to a large statue of a salamander, an eternal flame still burning within its mouth.\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d Kryan commanded, raising his gun. A machine, moving as if it were alive, appeared in the distance. \u201cIt looks just like those bones.\u201d\n\nNo. It was made from the bones that had been dug up and the eight limbed thing came charging at us. Kyran fired, to no effect, before Quincy stepped out and clapped, uttering a single word.\n\nThe machinery grinded to a halt and collapsed; I was right- it had been made from the bones of the things above, strapped to gears and circuitry.\n\nWhatever those things were, the worshippers below had clearly venerated them enough to create frankenstein-like beasts in their fashion. \u201cWell that was\u2026 not at cool as I thought it\u2019d be.\u201d Kyran shrugged.\n\n\u201cAnd,\u201d Rainie added, gesturing to the statue, \u201clooks like that\u2019s a sort of artifact we\u2019ll want to secure.\u201d In the mouth of the Salamander statue, was the flame- and as I studied it- I realized it was a book that was burning.\n\nQuincy put the flames out and handed the warm pages to me. This was powerful alright. I reached into the ether and felt that it contained great animosity, malevolence- something insane.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Quincy murmured, \u201cI don\u2019t want to alarm you, but-\u201d the walls started to creak, and they began to slowly move downwards, threatening to crush us, \u201cwe are at risk of immediate death.\u201d\n\nWe ran out of the temple and back on the stairs, which were now starting to shake, and crumble. Quincy quick-casted some spell, and we ran, tugging on the rope.\n\nVaraluz, despite my opinions towards him, was skilled, effective, and he activated the machine pulling us in, just as the steps collapsed. The rope hung in midair, slowly drifting upwards.\n\nBy the end of the hour we were out. I gave Varaluz the details. The mass grave had completely been excavated, and all the skeletons sent to facility deep within the clutches of the Company.\n\nMore research would be done by a secondary team, but the immediate danger was neutralized. The automata, traps, and all had been disabled by Quincy, and the temple, according to a scan, had largely collapsed.\n\nBut there was something underneath it- a second temple that mirrored the concentric squares of the graves, ready to be excavated and revealed. And according to an initial scan- there were life signs inside.\n\nThat, I assume, was where the real treasures were hiding.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t my business. The initial first contact was made, the fears within stabilized. My job there was done; another day was complete. The unexplained was eliminated, and I was ready to move on another excursion.\n\nThe world is filled with places like these. And I\u2019m just one of many who work to keep these hidden away. We keep the public safe. It\u2019s what we do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[House of Tongues](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/141n12x/i_work_for_a_company_that_studies_cursed_places/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[but flip a coin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13w1qwy/i_volunteered_for_an_expedition_to_get_off_death/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

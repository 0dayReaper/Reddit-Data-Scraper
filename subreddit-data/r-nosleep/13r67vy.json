    "postText": "I was teaching English Language and Literature, and Cate was crying in the recycling bin again. I was trying to talk about rhetorical devices, but my hand was shaking too much for me to write on the board. Every time Cate shifted, the room went dead silent for a moment as we all waited to see whether she would come out, and we all let out a collective sigh of relief when she didn\u2019t. She\u2019d pulled the whole bin over her head, spilling papers and cans across the floor, and only her legs were sticking out.\n\nThe corpse on the floor was starting to smell. Meredith had been a bit annoying, a bit too loud for her own good, but she\u2019d always meant well. She\u2019d joked around with me and the other teachers, and had always thanked me when I gave her an Expo marker because she'd lost all of hers again. We must have lived close to each other, because I often saw her in the Publix by my house when I went to get groceries.\n\n\"Hi, Mr. Jones! It's me!\" she would yell, waving her hands above her head to make sure that I noticed her.\n\nHer body had been laying there on the tiles long enough that it was starting to attract flies.\n\nCate was in her last year of school and had recently transferred from a private academy that had been shut down. She was quiet, and weird, but every school that I'd ever taught at had a kid like that, so I wasn\u2019t too concerned. She did have a couple strange habits; she would sometimes stand up in the middle of class and stab her pencil into her desk, or start screaming for no reason, or something else which made it obvious that she had some issues.\n\nNone of us reacted to it. We noticed it, certainly, but then her behavior just\u2026slid out of notice, and we didn\u2019t care anymore. When Cate was yelling or breaking things or engaging in another of her destructive habits, I ignored her, the same as all my other students did. *Oh, there goes Cate again*, I\u2019d think, then immediately stop paying attention. During that year, I spent dozens of hours teaching with the background noise of Cate\u2019s screams.\n\nCate\u2019s sobs hitched, then stopped. She shifted, her hands coming out from under the bin, clutching the edge of it.\n\n\u201cThe flies are annoying me,\u201d she whined, a pout audible in her voice. There was a moment where there was absolute stillness, like the world had been put on pause, then the flies that had been hovering around Meredith\u2019s body started dropping out of the air. They stopped buzzing one by one and landed soundlessly on the ground, falling in a slow wave that traveled outwards from Cate.\n\nShe had only started to get scary, proper scary, a couple months ago. She walked through the front doors of the lunchroom sort of uneasily, glancing around and cataloging everything present. A bubble silence followed wherever she went, with everyone instantly going quiet when she approached, then picking up where they left off as soon as she moved out of range. It seemed natural, almost, just a pause in conversation that happened to coincide with Cate\u2019s location. That\u2019s certainly how I explained it to myself at the time.\n\nShe had about a dozen pieces of paper in her hands, all of them printed on in an absurdly huge font, so that there were only a couple words on each page. She dropped all of it right in front of me, paper and my food flying everywhere. She put her palms flat on the table and leaned forward, looming over me. She said nothing, but I couldn\u2019t move under her gaze, and everyone near me scattered. They fled almost frantically, but as soon as they got far enough away from Cate, they slowed to a halt, confused about why they were running.\n\n\u201cRead,\u201d Cate said quietly, and I obeyed.\n\n It was a strange story about a little girl and the monster in her closet. I found myself reading the part of the girl, entirely against my will, my hands clenched tight around the pages and my voice coming with no direction from me. Cate took the part of the monster.\n\n**Hey, little one, it's me.** \n\n*Hi, closet monster.*\n\n**So, for today's existential question, how do you feel about the afterlife?**\n\n*I don't want to die.*\n\n**Why not?**\n\n*The Dixieland preachers speaking broken Spanish to the little girl that lurks at the back of the congregation, the light of her second-hand phone reflecting the faith in the pews.*\n\n**That's\u2026 not an answer, little one.**\n\n*And light-sick strangers huddled in the red-eye bus while the man in the corner sings One Direction, shaking his hands at the roof of the bus like he can see through it to the nighttime clouds above.*\n\n**Public transportation is disgusting.**\n\n*And Las Vegas painted women who dance in a circle and shake their blue breasts, the glitter on their skirts shifting with the rhythm of their footsteps. I can imagine them around a bonfire, shaking their feathered hips for spirits instead of men, accompanied by a wordless roar from the crowds hiding in the shadows.*\n\n**I see how you want that, the praise and the confidence, I see how you turn towards scraps of kindness like a sunflower.**\n\n*I want that. God, I want that.*\n\n**I'm sorry, darling, but that's not in the story tonight. This is the blue bruised final chapter.**\n\n*This is where he comes home in the middle of the night, drunk as hell, and leaves his marks.*\n\n**This is when I go back to my closet and leave you with him.***T*\n\n*his is the part where I am alone.*\n\n**You won\u2019t be alone forever.**\n\n*I hope you\u2019re right. Goodnight, monster.*\n\n**Goodnight, little one.**I\n\n read for hours, just starting again when I reached the end, until my voice was breaking. Groups of students came in and out, then teachers and a janitor, and none of them so much as glanced in my direction. By the time Cate finally allowed it to end, I was barely rasping the words, and my whole body ached from being held so tense. I was released from my forced stillness, and I slumped forward onto the table, my muscles trembling, too exhausted to move. Cate ran her fingers through my hair, almost comfortingly, while I cried. It was awkward, like she'd seen it demonstrated but never had a chance to experience it herself.\n\n\"Do you understand?\" Cate asked, smoothing the paper mindlessly against the table.\n\n\"No,\" I whispered, truthfully. I was shaking uncontrollably, and I got to my feet out of an instinctual urge to seem bigger than the predator in the room.\n\n\"I am alone,\" she repeated, her hands pressed hard against the table. \"Do. You. Understand?\"\n\nI shook my head mutely, then I took a careful step back, putting a chair between me and Cate. She was just a student, and I'd never been scared of her before, but suddenly I understood how it felt to be a rabbit cowering before a fox.\n\nCate was sitting perfectly still, looking off blankly into the distance. It sounded like the table was splintering under her grip, the metal joints shrieking under the pressure. I took another step back, staring at her hand\u2013her nails were actually leaving gouges, ten perfect lines scored deep into the wood.\n\nCate\u2019s face twisted in rage, then abruptly smoothed out. \u201cThat\u2019s alright. You will.\u201d\n\nBy then, the school day was long over, and I could see the sun setting through the windows. The shadows seemed to cluster around Cate, settling over her shoulders like a mantle. I started backing away from her, slowly, then broke into a run when she didn\u2019t stop me. I looked over my shoulder the whole way, and she never stopped watching me. Even when I left her sight, bursting through the front doors of the school and sprinting through the darkening lawn to my car, I still felt her eyes on me.\n\nI called out sick the next day and hid under my cover like I was a child again, knowing all the while that blankets wouldn't protect me from Cate. I didn't go in the next day, or the day after that, and eventually the principal called me up on the landline that I kept around out of nostalgia, asking if I was okay.\n\n\"I'll be there tomorrow,\" I said into the phone, speaking around the dread crawling down my throat.\n\nAll the way through the twenty minutes of my commute, I told myself that I was being stupid, that Cate had been pulling some kind of prank. I forced myself to believe it, allowing no other explanation to take root in my mind, but when I came into my first class and saw her sitting in the front row, I almost walked right back out.\n\nFor just a second, she pinned me with a glare that burned with the force of a nuclear blast, then she turned away and it was gone. She was just a regular student again, watching me explain the irony in Oedipus Rex and almost falling asleep at her desk from boredom. She took lackluster notes and was out of the room as soon as the bell rang, along with the rest of the teenagers. As soon as she was gone, I locked myself in the tiny storage room adjacent to my classroom that I had made into an office.\n\nSince I was a teenager, I've periodically had panic attacks, so I knew the symptoms. A formless sense of dread was crawling over my skin, pressing down on me with a force that felt physical. I couldn't breathe; my brain thought it was suffocating. I've learned a lot of different strategies for dealing with them, but the one that works best for me involves grounding myself in the physical environment by naming all the objects around me.\n\nSo when Ms. Anderson, the math teacher whose classroom was across the hall, came into the office, I was sitting on the floor, muttering random words to myself. Anderson and I have been friendly, even if we aren't friends; we'll say hello in the hallway and compare pictures of our pets, but that's about it. She's always been kind, though, to me and her students.\n\n\"Chair,\" I muttered, staring at the industrial beige armchair across the room from me until it came into focus. \"Picture frame. Desk lamp.\"\n\n\"Oh god,\" Anderson said. \"Are you okay?\"\n\nI nodded without looking at her. I'd mentioned that I occasionally had panic attacks to her before, so I was hoping she'd take the hint and leave. Instead she kneeled down beside me and handed me her beanie, a knitted monstrosity with bells, embroidery, and glitter. So. Much. Glitter.It was an awful hat, but it was certainly effective at helping me calm down. The feel of the rough fibers and the many different textures were grounding. Also, when holding onto such an ugly hat, it was hard to focus on anything else enough to panic.\n\n\"My grandma knitted it for me, and I love her more than I hate this,\" Anderson said. \"Whenever I give it to my little cousin, she settles down right away, so I figured it might help you too.\"\n\n\"Are you calling me a child?\" I said, grateful my voice came out mostly steady. \"If so, you should know that I ate Legos as a baby.\"\n\nAnderson shrugged. \"Maturity is a social construct. Hey, did I ever tell you about my trip to the beach last weekend?\"\n\nShe kept talking, an endless spiel of inane chatter about various parts of her day, her side pressed against mine the whole time.I\n\n kept teaching. What other choice did I have? I needed the money, and anyways, I felt a strange sort of spite towards Cate. She had invaded my space, challenged my authority, and gotten away with it, and the only way I could fight back, in my mind, was by refusing to give in.\n\nAfter the day in the cafeteria, though, she seemed to calm down. She stopped her constant outbursts, just sitting with her head resting on her arms for my whole class, almost seeming resigned.\n\nSometimes she would take out the big pack of markers that she kept in the front pocket of her backpack and draw on herself. Her face would get a big purple and blue mark stretching along her jaw, then there would be a jagged red line sketched down her arm. Every single one of her drawings looked like a wound, depicted so realistically that a couple of times, despite my fear, I was concerned that she had gotten a life-threatening injury between the time it took to walk in the door and sit down.\n\nFor months, things were calm. I got closer with Ms. Anderson, and found out that her name was Meredith. We spent our lunches together, and I learned that she could talk for hours about the most inconsequential things, rambling on and on until somebody told her to stop. She had a deep hatred of biscuits; if one was eaten in the same room as her, she would instantly leave, complaining that she could smell.\n\nShe even had a sign on her classroom door: **absolutely NO biscuits, on penalty of me being mildly disappointed in you.**\n\nWhen the end-of-year showcase came around, Meredith and I complained about it together. It was supposed to be a chance for students to show off what they\u2019d learned, but it just ended up being a chance for parents to complain about all the grievances they had with our teaching.Despite all our hate-filled rants, the first part of the showcase went well. Meredith and I had been paired together, because our rooms were close together and because the principal knew we were friends, which made it somewhat better. Only somewhat, though, because we were fully absorbed in the chaos of taking charge of both our classes, thirty or so students in total.\n\nDozens of moody little gremlins came up to the front of the room and recited a bit of poetry, or talked about something interesting they\u2019d learned in science class, before scampering back to their seats. Most of them were teenagers, and thought they were above what we were doing, so there was the added challenge of actually getting them to perform to their parents and the other students. I was so absorbed in making sure that they all stayed alive and somewhat quiet that I barely even noticed when Cate came in with her dad.\n\nHe was a tall man, unnaturally tall, with a wispy mustache that fell limply around his mouth and a scowl that seemed to be permanently etched on his mouth. I had that moment of realization that comes with meeting students' parents, *so this is why you\u2019re so weird.*\n\nHe had a firm grip on her arm, so tight that it looked painful. Cate just let him pull her in, dragging her feet all the way to the back of the room, where they sat down. The rest of the evening flew past in a flurry of presentations and half-hearted applause, until I got to Cate\u2019s name. By that point, all the parents had left the room to go listen to the principal talk about signing up for next year's classes, so it was just me, the students, and Cate\u2019s dad left in the room.\n\n\u201cCate?\u201d I said, being very careful not to look at the corner where she sat. \u201cDo you have something to present?\u201d\n\nI expected her to shake her head and let me finish wrapping up so I could go home. Meredith, standing next to me, felt the exact same way, judging by the exhaustion in her posture. Instead, she hesitated, glancing over at her father. In the corner where they sat, the lights barely reached, so I could just see their silhouettes. Her father rose, suddenly, and she stood with him, pulled along in his wake. They swept to the front of the room\u2014well, he swept, and she followed in his footsteps much less elegantly.\n\n\u201cMy daughter has something to show you,\u201d he said, and his voice echoed across the room like a shockwave, pressing into my ears with a physical force.\n\nMeredith stepped forward, her hands up, trying to escalate. \n\n\u201cSir, Cate needs to give her presentation on her own, so if you could just sit down\u2026\u201d\n\nHe sneered at her, then jerked a hand like he was swatting a mosquito.\n\nMeredith\u2019s eyes went wide and unseeing, frost rippling over her skin and cracking in the same moment even as the tips of her hair caught fire. Shadows came drifting out from the corners and under the desks to wrap tight around her throat, even as her hands came up to claw helplessly at them. Then there was a decisive jerk, and the crack of her neck breaking. She was held there, for just a moment, before the shadows drifted away and she crumpled to the ground.\n\n\u201cDad, please\u2014\u201d Cate was begging, black ink flowing from her eyes and dripping down her nose. I think she was crying, in the only way that she could.\n\nHe drew back and hit her across the face, a solid backhand that threw her onto the floor and split her lip open. She pushed herself up on her elbows, cowering back from him, and as I watched, her lip healed itself. The wound sealed over, until the only thing left was the crusted blood.\n\nMy students were sobbing as I stumbled over to Meredith, my knees unable to support my weight. I pressed my fingers against her neck, then started CPR when I didn\u2019t feel a pulse, pleading with her the whole time. The full extent of my knowledge of CPR came from a single lesson when I was in my twenties, and I knew that I probably wasn\u2019t doing any good, but I couldn\u2019t just sit there and do nothing.\n\n\u201cCall an ambulance!\u201d I yelled at one of the kids in the front row. \n\nHe broke out his shock long enough to fumble for his phone, but that was forestalled by Cate\u2019s father snapping his fingers. The phone shattered into a million tiny shards of glass.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, you\u2019re all going to sit here like good little ducklings and let my daughter feed.\u201d\n\nHe pulled Cate to her feet by her hair, then shoved her towards me.\n\nCate backed away from him, shaking her head. \u201cI don\u2019t, I don\u2019t want to, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do it or you\u2019ll starve,\u201d he said. \u201cI want them dead by the time I get back.\u201d\n\nHe left the room as quickly as he appeared, leaving silence behind him, filled only with Cate\u2019s heavy breathing. The inky substance that she had cried in the place of tears was staining her cheeks.S\n\nhe slid to the floor, curling up in a ball. \u201dNo, no,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, no.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he mean?\u201d one of the kids in the front row asked, their voice trembling.\n\nShe curled up tighter. \u201cI-I have to feed on your\u2026your fear. Dad\u2019s been bringing me food but he says it\u2019s time for me to be self-sufficient.\u201d When she turned towards me, rage was in her expression. \u201cI told you, I told you but you didn\u2019t listen. You left me alone. You left me alone!\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered, my hands still pressed against Meredith's chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, I can help you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d she screamed, slamming her fist against the floor. It shattered under her, big chunks cracking apart. She pointed at me. \u201cI need to think. You\u2019re going to teach while I think.\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t move, she screamed again, and the walls vibrated with the force of it. I slowly got up from where I had been hunched over Meredith\u2019s body *(don\u2019t think about it, just don\u2019t, there will be time to grieve later)* and made my way to the whiteboard. Her very presence gave off a paralyzing effect; I was terrified, and I desperately wanted to run, fight, anything, but I couldn\u2019t do anything but what she had commanded me to do.\n\nCate pulled the recycling bin over her head to block out the world, sobbing, and I taught the class. I talked until my voice broke, circling through the same couple of topics over and over.\n\nAfter what must have been hours, her crying stopped, and the bin that she had placed around her head burned away in seconds. \u201cThis is your fault,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t help me. This is your fault.\u201d\n\nShe brought her hands together and I joined Meredith, dead on the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey, this is Cate here. There\u2019s something interesting about the kind of thing that I am. When we eat something, we get all their memories, so I know exactly how Mr. Jones felt in his last moments. He\u2019s still alive, somewhere inside me. Still screaming. I've learned, since killing him, the joy that comes with the devouring. I resisted, before, but now I understand.\n\nI posted this, the full recounting of the last days of Tristan Jones, for one reason and one reason only. I need you to be afraid. I need you to be very, very afraid. You taste better when you\u2019re terrified.",

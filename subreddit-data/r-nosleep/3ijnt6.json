    "postText": "First post: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3iex1h/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest/\n\nSo I logged back on tonight and was blown away by the staggering amount of interest this seems to have generated. First off, I'll address a few things that you guys have brought up:\n\n* There's been an overwhelming amount of people mentioning the similarity between some of my stories and those of David Paulides. I assure you I'm not trying to rip him off in any way, I've got nothing but respect for the guy. He's actually what inspired me to write this, because I can verify a lot of the things he talks about. We do have a lot of these strange missing persons cases, and most of the time they aren't solved. Either that, or we find them in places they have no business being. I personally haven't been on many calls like that, but I'll share a few that I've seen, and a story my friend told me that relates to this.\n\n* There was a lot of feedback about the stairs, so I'll touch on that briefly here, and I'll also include a story. \nThey come in a variety of shapes, sizes, styles, and conditions. Some are pretty dilapidated, just ruins, but others are brand new. I saw one set that looked like they came from a lighthouse: they were metal and spiral, almost old-fashioned. \nThe stairs don't go up infinitely, or farther than I can see, but some sets are taller than others. Like I said before, just imagine the stairs in your house, as if someone cut-and-pasted them in the middle of nowhere. I don't have any pictures, it's never really occurred to me to try again after the first time, and I don't really feel like risking my job over it. I'll try again in the future, but I can't really promise anything.\n\n* A few people expressed confusion about the guy who ran into the man with no face. Just to clarify, when the climber ascended and reached the top of this peak, he saw another man in a parka and ski pants. This was the man with no face. Sorry about the confusing wording of that story, I'll try to avoid that in the future.\n\nAlright, on to the new stories:\n\n* As far as missing persons go, I'd say about half the calls I get are related to that. The others are rescue calls; people who fall down cliffs and hurt themselves, get injured by fire (you wouldn't believe how often this happens, mostly drunk kids), get bitten or stung by animals or insects. We're a tight team, and we have veterans who are excellent at finding signs of lost people. That's what makes these cases where we never find any trace of them so frustrating. One in particular was upsetting for all of us, because we *did* find a trace of them, but it just led to more questions than answers.\nAn older man had been hiking alone on a well-established trail, but his wife called to say that he hadn't come home when he should have. Apparently he had a history of seizures, and she was worried that he hadn't taken his medication and had suffered one out on the trail. Before you ask, I have no idea why he thought it was okay to go out alone, or why she didn't go with him. I don't ask about that kind of thing because past a certain point, it really doesn't matter. Someone is missing, and it's my job to find them. We went out in a standard search formation, and it wasn't long before one of our vets found signs that the guy had gone off the trail. We grouped up and followed him, spreading out in a fan to make sure we were covering as much ground as possible. Suddenly, a call comes over the radio telling us to all head back to the vets location, and we come right away, because this usually means the missing person is injured, and we need a full team to help get them out safely. \nWe meet back up, and the vet is just standing at the base of a tree with his hands on the sides of his head. I ask my buddy what's going on, and he points up into the branches of this tree. I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing, but there's a walking stick dangling from a branch at least thirty feet off the ground. The little strap thing on the handle has been looped around the branch, and it's just hanging there. There's no way the guy could have tossed it up that far, and we don't see any other signs that he's still in the area. We call up into the tree, but it's obvious no one's in it. We're all just sort of left scratching our heads. We keep searching for the guy, but we never find him. We even bring our canines out, but they lose his scent long before this tree. Eventually, the search is called off, because there are other calls we have to attend to, and past a certain point there's not much we can do. The guy's wife called us every day for *months*, asking if we'd found her husband, and it was heartbreaking to hear her get more and more hopeless each time.\nI'm not sure why this call in particular was so upsetting, but I think it was just the sheer improbability of it. That and the questions that were raised. How the hell had this guy's cane ended up there? Did someone kill him and toss that up there as some weird trophy? We did our best to find him, but it was almost like a taunt. We still talk about that one from time to time.\n\n* Missing kids are the most heart-breaking. Doesn't matter what circumstances they go missing under, it's never easy, and we always, *always* dread the ones we find deceased. It's not common, but it does happen. David Paulides talks a lot about kids SAR teams find in places they shouldn't be, or couldn't be. I can honestly say I've heard about this kind of thing happening more than I've seen it, but I'll share one of the ones that I think about a lot that I witnessed personally.\nA mother and her three kids were out for a picnic in an area of the park that has a small lake. One is six, one is five, and the other is about three. She's watching them all really closely, and according to her, she never lets them out of her sight at any time. She never saw anyone else in the area either, which is important.\nShe packs their stuff up and they start to head back to the parking area. Now, this lake is only about two miles into the woods, and it's on a *very* clearly established trail. It's almost impossible to get lost getting from the parking area to it, unless you're deliberately going off the path like an imbecile. Her kids are walking in front of her, when she hears what sounds like someone coming up the path behind her. She turns around, and in the four or so seconds she's not looking, her five-year-old son vanishes. She figures he's stepped off the trail to pee or something, and she asks her other two where he went. They both tell her that 'a big man with a scary face' came out of the woods next to them, took the kid's hand, and led him into the trees. The two remaining kids don't seem upset, in fact she says later that it seems like they've been drugged. They're sort of spacey and fuzzy. So of course, she freaks out, starts looking frantically in the area for her kid. She's screaming his name, and she says at one point she thinks she heard him answer her. Now obviously she can't go blindly running into the woods, she's got the other two kids, so she calls the police and they send us out immediately. We respond, and we start the search for him.Over the course of this search, which spans *miles*, we never find a single trace of the kid. Canines can't pick up any scent, we don't find any clothing or broken bushes or literally anything that would signify a child being there. Of course there's suspicion about the mother for a while, but it's pretty clear that she's completely destroyed by the whole thing. We looked for this kid for weeks, with a lot of volunteer help.  But eventually, the search peters out, and we have to move on. \nThe volunteers keep searching, though, and one day we get a call on the radio letting us know that a body has been found and needs to be recovered. They tell us the location, and none of us can believe it. We figure it has to be a different kid. But we go out there, about 15 miles from the site where he vanished, and sure enough, we find the body of the kid we've been looking for. \nI have been trying to figure out how this kid got where he did ever since we found him, and I've never come up with an answer. A volunteer just happened to be in the area, because he figured he might as well look in places no one else would think to on the off chance the body had been dumped. He comes to the base of a tall, rocky slope, and half-way up, he sees something. He looks through his binoculars and sure enough, it's the body of a little boy, stuffed in a little opening in the rock. He recognizes the color of the kid's shirt, so he knows right away that it's the missing boy. That's when he calls it in, and we're dispatched.\nIt took us almost an hour to get his body down, and none of us could believe what we were seeing. Not only was this kid 15 miles from where he'd started, there was no possible way he could have gotten up there on his own. This slope is treacherous, and it's hard even for us with our climbing gear. A five-year-old boy had no way of getting up there, of that I'm certain.\nNot only that, but the kid doesn't have a scratch on him. His shoes are gone, but his feet aren't damaged or dirty. So it wasn't as if an animal dragged him up there. And from what we can tell, he hasn't been dead that long. He'd been out there over a month by that point, and it looked like he'd only been dead for, at most, a day or two. The whole thing was unbelievably strange, and was one of the most disconcerting calls I've ever been on. \nWe found out later that the coroner determined the kid had died from exposure. He'd frozen to death, probably late at night two days before we found him. There were no suspects, and no answers. To date, it's one of the weirdest things I've ever seen.\n\n* One of my first jobs as a trainee was a search op for a four-year-old kid that had gotten separated from his mom. This was one of those cases where we knew we were gonna find him because the dogs were on a strong scent trail, and we saw clear signs that he was in the area. We ended up finding him in a berry patch about half a mile from where he'd been last seen. Kid wasn't even aware that he'd wandered that far. One of the vets brought him back, which I was glad for because I'm really not good with kids, and I find it hard to talk to them and keep them company. \nAs my trainer and I are headed back, she decides to take me on a detour to show me one of the hot spots where we tend to find missing people. It's a natural dip in the land near a popular trail, and people will usually move downhill because it's easier. We hike out there, it's a few miles away, and we get there in about an hour or so. As we're walking around the area and she's pointing out places she's found people in the past, I see something in the distance. Now, this area we're in is about eight miles from the main parking area, though there's back roads you can take to get closer if you don't want to hike that far. But we're on state-protected land, which means there can't be any kind of commercial or residential development out here. The most you'll ever see is a fire tower or makeshift shelter that homeless people think they can get away with building. But I can see from here that whatever this thing is has straight edges, and if there's one thing you learn quickly, it's that nature rarely makes straight lines. I point it out, but she doesn't say anything. She just hangs back and lets me wander over and check it out. I get within about twenty feet of it, and all the hair on the back of my neck stands up.\nIt's a staircase. In the middle of the fucking woods. In the proper context, it would literally be the most benign thing ever. It's just a normal staircase, with beige carpet, and about ten steps tall. But instead of being in a house, where it obviously should be, it's out here in the middle of the woods. The sides aren't carpeted, obviously, and I can see the wood it's made of. It's almost like a video game glitch, where the house has failed to load completely and the stairs are the only thing visible. \nI stand there, and it's like my brain is working overtime to try and make sense of what I'm seeing. My trainer comes and stands next to me, and she just stands there casually, looking at it as if it's the least interesting thing in the world. I ask her what the fuck this thing is doing here, and she just chuckles.\n'Get used to it, rookie. You're gonna see a lot of them.' I start to move closer, but she grabs my arm. Hard.\n'I wouldn't do that.' She says. Her voice is casual, but her grip is tight, and I just stand there looking at her. 'You're gonna see them all the time, but don't go near them. Don't touch them, don't go up them. Just ignore them.' I start to ask her about it, but something in the way she's looking at me tells me that it's best if I don't. We end up moving on, and the subject doesn't come up again for the rest of my training.\nShe was right, though. I'd say about every fifth call I go on, I end up running across a set of stairs. Sometimes they're relatively close to the path, maybe within two or three miles. Sometimes they're twenty, thirty miles out, literally in the middle of nowhere, and I only find them during the broadest searches or training weekends. They're usually in good condition, but sometimes it looks like they've been out there for miles. All different kinds, all different sizes. The biggest I ever saw looked like they came out of a turn-of-the-century mansion, and were at least ten feet wide, with steps leading up at least fifteen or twenty feet.\nI've tried talking about it with people, but they just give me the same response my trainer did. 'It's normal. Don't worry about it, they're not a big deal, but don't go close to them or up them.' When trainees ask me about it now, I give them the same response. I don't really know what else to tell them. I'm really hoping someday I get a better answer, but it hasn't happened yet.\n\n* This is another one that was less spooky and more sad. A young man went missing late in winter, when realistically no one should be going that far out onto the trails. We close a lot of them, but some remain open year round, unless there's a shit-load of snow. We did an op for him, but we had about six feet of snow on the ground (it was an unusually heavy snow year), and we knew it wasn't likely that we'd find him until spring when the thaw came. Sure enough, when the first big thaw came, a hiker reported a body a little ways off the main trail. We found him at the base of a tree, in a pile of melted snow. I knew right away what had happened, and it scared the living shit out of me. Most of you who ski or snowboard, or spend any amount of time on a mountain, will probably have guessed too. When snow falls, it doesn't collect as thick in the areas beneath the branches. It happens most with fir trees, because they have a sort of closed umbrella shape. So what you end up with is a space around the base of a tree that's filled with a mixture of loose, powdery snow, air, and branches. They're called tree wells, and they're not immediately obvious if you don't know what you're looking for. We put up signs in the welcome center, big ones, letting people know how dangerous they are, but every year that we get an unusual amount of snow, at least one person doesn't read them, or doesn't take the warning seriously, and we find out about it in spring. \nMy best guess is that this young man was hiking and got tired, or maybe a cramp from walking in the deep snow. He went to go sit at the base of the tree, not knowing that there was a tree well, and fell in. He got stuck with his feet up, and the surrounding snow caved in around him. Unable to free himself, he suffocated. It's called snow immersion suffocation, and it doesn't usually happen except in really deep snow. But if you get stuck in a weird position, like this guy did, even six feet of snow can be lethal.\nWhat scared me the most was imagining how he must have struggled. Upside down, in the freezing cold, he didn't die quickly. The snow would have formed a dense, heavy pile on top of him, and it would have been literally impossible to get out. As it got harder to breathe, he would have known what was happening. I can't even imagine what he was thinking in his last moments.\n\n* A lot of my less outdoorsy friends want to know if I've ever seen the Goatman while I've been out on calls. Unfortunately, or I guess fortunately, I've never had anything quite like that happen. I guess the closest was the whole 'black-eyed man' thing, but I didn't see anything. However, there was one call where I had something kind of similar happen, but I'm not sure I'm willing to chalk it up to the Goatman.\nWe'd gotten a report that an older woman had fainted along one of the trails, and needed assistance getting back down to the main area.\nWe hike up to where she's at, and her husband is just beside himself. He runs, well, I guess more jogs, to us, and tells us that he was a little ways off the trail looking at something when his wife starts screaming behind him. He runs back to her and she's passed out on the trail. We get her on a backboard, and as we're getting her down to the welcome center, she comes to and starts screaming again. I calm her down and ask her what happened. I can't remember verbatim what she said, but essentially, what happened was this:\nShe'd been waiting for her husband when she started hearing this really strange sound. She said it sounded sort of like a cat, but it was off somehow, and she couldn't quite figure out why. She went a little ahead to try and hear it better, and it sounded like it was coming closer. She said the closer it got, the more uneasy she was, until she finally figured out what was wrong. I do remember this next part, because it was so weird that I don't think I could forget it if I tried.\n\"It wasn't a cat. It was a man, saying the word 'meow' over and over. Just 'meow, meow, meow'. But it wasn't a man, it couldn't have been, because I've never heard a man make his voice buzz like that. I thought my hearing aid was going out, but it wasn't, I adjusted it and it still sounded all buzzy. It was awful. He was coming closer, but I couldn't see him. And the closer he got the more scared I was, and the last thing I remember was a shape coming out of the trees. I guess that's when I fainted.\" \nNow, obviously I'm a little perplexed as to why a guy would be out in the fucking woods chanting 'meow, meow' at people. So once we get down the mountain, I tell my superior that I'm gonna go search the area to see if I can find anything. He gives me the go ahead, and I grab a radio and hike back to where she fainted. I don't see anyone, so I keep going about a mile more, and I when I head back I go off the trail, to see if I can figure out where she saw him coming from. It's almost sunset by this point, and I don't have any desire to be out at night alone, so I just sort of write it off and make a mental note to check it out again tomorrow. But as I'm headed back, I start to hear something in the distance. I stop, and I call out for anyone in the immediate area to identify themselves. The sound didn't come closer or get louder, but it sounded exactly like a man saying 'meow, meow' in this really odd monotone. As comical as it makes it sound, it was almost like that guy on South Park with the electrolarynx, Ned. I go off the trail in the direction I think it's coming from, but I never seem to get closer. It's almost like it's coming from all directions. Eventually, it just sort of fades out, and I ended up going back to the welcome center. \nI didn't get any further reports like that, and even though I went back to that area, I never heard that exact sound again. I suppose it could have been some stupid kid out there fucking with people, but even I have to admit it was weird. \n\nSo this kind of turned into a massive wall of text, and for that I apologize. I wanted to get to the stories my friend told me, and he does have some good ones, so I'll post those tomorrow evening. I also have a few more of my own I think you guys will like. I'm sorry to keep you all in suspense again, hopefully the stories here make up for it and help you get through the next 24 hours until I can post again!\n\nEDIT: Since it seems like all of you would like to hear more, tomorrow I'll write up as many stories as I can and do a massive post. I'll include my friend's stories, and I'll see if I can't get ahold of a few more people who might have interesting things to talk about. I just wasn't sure how people felt about big huge walls of text, but if you're all okay with it, I'll post lots of stories!\n\n**EDIT: Part 3 is up: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3iocju/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest/**",

Once you get so far out, it gets swampy and hard to walk, both of my shoes got sucked down into the mud, I eventually found my way back out. Now I'm moving there again, the kitchen window and the 2 windows at the back of the living room look right out into it. There's a building in the backyard, there's a back room stretching into the woods over the edge of a steep hill. I'm going to get some really thick curtains for those living room windows...",

James and other authors)\n\nFor instance, a friend I knew from my first job out of college told me once, about the time he was headed home after a visit with family members. His trip took him, during one leg of it, down a small highway in the middle of nowhere in southern Arkansas, a long way with nothing but woods along both sides of the road. He was driving along, had rarely come across another vehicle for the past half hour, and this was at around one in the morning. \n\nSuddenly he noticed something in the beams of his headlights up ahead and he slammed on the brakes. His headlights were shining on something black that extended from the trees on one side of the road to the trees on the other side. Took him a second to realize it wasn't some singular black thing but several black shapes moving across the road. He was looking at a procession of people in hooded black robes walking across the highway. A few turned to glance at him and he saw some peoples' faces. Guessed there may have been over fifty people out in the middle of nowhere after midnight walking through the woods. So he backed his car up about twenty feet and as soon they finished crossing and strode out of sight into the woods he put his foot down on the gas and drove away very fast. Didn't stop speeding until he reached the interstate. He was worried he saw something he shouldn't have. Backwoods cultists? Who knew? He certainly didn't want to hang around and find out.",

There's a large rock that is a popular high dive spot about a few hundred yards from camp.  So at like 2AM and after a few bottles of whiskey we decide we're night jumping.  We pile over to the rock and proceed to start diving off said rock and continue to consume adult beverages.  So about 30 minutes later we see a light walking down the trail.  We didn't think anything of it just someone coming over to get their rock on.  All of sudden we see it's a line of about 25 people.  They don't say anything. They're single file.  One by one they split all of us sitting on the rock, climb up, and jump off fully clothed.  Swim to shore and start hiking out in the same order they came.  Not a single person from that group made a sound.  They walked up, Climbed the rock, jumped off, swam to shore and walked out.  Weirdest thing I\"d ever seen.  We didn't know what to do or what to think.  We were pretty sure they were Mormons but that's really all we had.  After that we were pretty sure we'd had enough whiskey for the night and just sat there pondering WTF just happened. ",

            "comment": "I once got lost in the woods, on purpose, with one of my best friends. I worked for a guy who owned 1500 acres, and when we had down time I took my friend out to go hike somewhere and 'survive' for the night.\n\nSo dumb, now that I'm writing it out.\n\nWe hiked in and found a nice place, made a small shelter, and then built a large fire pit. We figured no animals would come near us if our fire raged throughout the night. We cooked dinner, drank a little, told stories over the fire, and relaxed. It wasn't until midnight where we started feeling uneasy.\n\nWe both felt it, a tension in the air. Everything seemed to get quiet, which was really odd because bugs were making their noises prior. And you always see in the movies, i.e. Signs, when bugs go quiet it's not a good sign. As we looked out into the surrounding woods, it started to rain. The shelter we made was good, but not nearly good enough to keep out rain.\n\nAs it got worse, we finally decided to pack up and hike back to our car, which I would say was five miles out. Packed and ready, we put out our fire and started walking. This is where it got weird.\n\nThere was no rain outside the shelter. It didn't even smell like rain, and the ground wasn't wet. We walked back to the shelter and the rain had gone from that place too. Thinking it was just normal Utah weather (if you don't know anything about Utah, the weather can change in minutes) we started hiking back as quickly as we could.\n\nIt was about ten minutes later when we started hearing things. My friend and I kept reacting to it, but I heard something different than he did. I heard a crackling fire type of thing, something warm sounding. He heard flapping of wings, like it was flying over his head. \n\nThis persisted until we started running as hard as we could and found the trail. It took us three hours to make it back to the car, and we were spooked out of our minds. We drove to the closest McDonald's and thanked God for our lives. \n\nReading these stories, and then reading thelords_cheeps comment gave a new light to my experience. The rain could have been a ploy to get us out of the shelter, away from the fire. I chalked up us hearing different things because it was dark and we were scared. But if the ploy to get us out of the fire worked, maybe it was trying to lure us via different means. \n\nI was cold, and it was dark, and a fire could mean warmth and light. For my friend, he was carrying his new pistol out with us. He kept talking about how he wanted to take down something big when we were out. The bird could have tried to lead him away from me. \n\nWho knows. All I know is nature stories like these have their own luring affect to them. Even though you might haven't experienced anything like this yourself, we probably know someone who has had a weird experience out in the wilderness. \n\nAnd after reading all this, I'm just gonna stay inside for the remainder of my life. Thanks.\n\n",

            "comment": "Reading everybody's comments has inspired me to share a story of my own. \n\nBetween the ages of 9-13 I lived in rural New Brunswick. I spent the majority of my free time in the forest and playing in the Rusagonis river and in ponds in the extensive forests. There was a place my friends and I used to go to where the birch trees were a lovely shade of soft pink. Everywhere else in the forest, they were white.\n\nAnyways, we would often travel out there to play in the pond that the trees encircled. I would sometimes travel into the forest alone as long as I had a large, strong stick with me (to fight off black bears if they should get bold and attack me). So, one day my friend and I were walking out down our usual path when suddenly we both became uneasy. We talked and decided to keep going. Sure enough, as we are walking, we hear a dog barking in the distance. We didn't think much of it until suddenly it sounded like the dog was directly behind us. We both screamed and I swear, I moved so fast that I don't even remember running. At one moment I was about to step over a fallen tree- the next, I was suddenly 100 meters or so ahead of where we had just been. My friend had also ran. I just remember the feel of adrenaline and suddenly being in a different spot. The barking didn't continue, but we were both pretty scared. In that same forest, we would sometimes come across an old dilapidated fence that was built in a circle. I don't know what the style is called, but it's when the beams in each segment take turns going up and down, and all kind of lean on each other to stay up. (Sorry if that's a horrible description). \n\nAnother time, I remember deciding I was going to explore some forest along the main river that I hadn't traversed before. So I went out on my own (Keep in mind, I spent maybe 90% of my free time in the forest and was not afraid of it). I remember at first feeling like this was going to be an awesome adventure. I then remember things being very quiet. I suddenly felt pretty unnerved and decided to turn back. Nothing happened, but I remember suddenly feeling like I needed to run. Pretty uneventful, but it was something to me back then.",

I can't explain everything I've seen in the wild but I can tell you this: you will see things out there that defy explanation &amp;, you'll spend the rest of your life wondering about them.\n\nIf you ever take word of caution, take this like your life depends on it: Don't go into the wild alone. Don't stray from your camp at night. Don't answer or seek out anything that calls you mysteriously in the night. DO NOT believe everything you see with your own eyes.\n\nI need to repeat that, Like your life depends on it: Do not believe things, especially 'out of place' 'people', voices, or suspicious things that you see, even with your own eyes, especially when your gut &amp; instincts are warning you.\n\nThere's something out there, something that scares grown men even like me, something we won't talk about but it's real, has no consistent form, and it lures you.\n\nIf you are a wild thing &amp; a hunter of human beings, there's no better hunting ground than our busiest national &amp; state parks. Note I said busisest. If you are a hunter of opportunity, then there's no better prey than the young, the weak, the old, the alone.\n\nThere's something out there, so old, so skilled, so clever &amp; cunning, not just a being but a species, that has or have developed a specialized survival skill: luring &amp; preying on lost or solitary humans.\n\nCan a predator in the natural world lure, trap, summon or even hypnotize their prey? A quick google search should yield you hundreds of examples of such species in the animal, fish, bird, and insect kingdoms.\n\nWhat I submit, if exist such a species, old as man, who's success depended on the successful hunting of humans, not only would it be very clever and good at it by now, but we'd have no record or memory of it in our history, just as no insect has probably ever survived an encounter with a trapdoor spider.\n\nI submit their hunting approach is case by case. They're lure different depending on their human prey's age, strength and size, but what I submit is that our oldest natural predator, an undiscovered predator, is still opperating due to it's skill of being able to read us like a book, hit us with lure (a lure I've distinctly recognized several times, particularly at night, just beyond the glow of the campfire) lead us into a trap, to never be seen or heard from again. \n\nPeople I submit a thing exists, something's out there, a species, that's not too unlike Stephen King's \"It\".\n\nI've felt the lure, tasted it, smelled it. It's the smell of food when you're hungry, company when you're lonely, music where there should be none, beauty where there's danger. Nothing can explain the sensations, but deep down you'll feel it, in your gut. Something's not right. Something's waiting. Something's watching. Ask any man who's survived long enough alone in the wild. There's a Siren like hunter out there. It'll own you dead to rights, if you don't listen to your gut.\n\nHaving said that. I have questions.\nThese stairs, do they move? There one minute, gone the next?\nDo others always see them? Or are they visible only to 'targets'?\nDo they see stairs? Or for them are the stairs another lure, like an apple pie, a warm bed, something to surrender to?\n\nWhat I'm getting at are these stairs def sound like the work of the It. A cave or door might be to scary to enter, but stairs, a perfect lure for the \"Search\" &amp; rescue mindset. Perhaps the vison of stairs are perfectlyt taylored to what's on 'your' frame of mind. \"If I could only find some higher ground to spot that lost kid. If only I had a ladder or a...\"\n\nSee what I mean?\n \n\n",

                                    "comment": "In my country, or at least among my people, we have a name for \"It\"/this \"predator\". We call them \"orang bunian\". \"Orang\" means people and \"bunian\", well, I'm not sure what \"bunian\" means. Sometimes we call them \"makhluk halus\", meaning invisible creatures. Two separate things essentially but I think they're interchangeable.\n\nMy mother's people from the Peninsula has a folklore about them. The folklore says that the orang bunian have their own civilization and usually reside within the jungles. Some say within the skies. There are various descriptions of them and their behavior. Some stories would make you think they're like elves from western folklores, some say they're a different type of human (you can even marry them) or you can google \"orang bunian\" and see for yourself. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orang_bunian). \n\nMy father's people who're a tribe that used to practice head-hunting in Borneo has some similar folklores about this \"predator\", though without the elegance of the elves. I find the stories interesting because two totally different cultures yet they both have the same \"creatures\". It's like how we have Eastern (e.g. Chinese) and Western dragons.\n\nI've said before that there are various descriptions of these orang bunian. But two descriptions remain consistent throughout the stories. The first is that they will always remain hidden to the naked eye unless they choose to reveal themselves. That's why sometimes when you're in the jungle, you feel like something is out there but you can't see it. \n\nThe second consistent description is that they have the \"power\" to lure you to a trap or according to the stories, to another world/dimension. Among my people, the orang bunian involvement is almost always the explanation for missing people who were found in impossible places.\n\nMy people have a set of rules when venturing into the jungle or the mountains, in addition to the ones written in the comment by /u/thelords_cheeps . These rules might seem superstitious to some, especially to more \"modern\" people. I think they were made to avoid encountering these orang bunian. Some of the rules are:\n\n1. Respect the jungle and its inhabitants, especially the plants.\n\n2. Never, ever boast/showoff or run your mouth off in the jungle. E.g, \"I can take on a tiger any time.\" \"Don't be such a wimp. It's not *that* hard.\" \"I'm not scared of anything in here.\" \n\n3. If you find a stone/crystal/whatever that's oddly beautiful, don't take it back with you. Don't even think of picking it up. According to the stories, these are either baits to lure you into their world. Or it can be a medium/vessel for the makhluk halus to follow you back home.\n\n4. And like another user commented, ask permission if you have the feeling like you have to. Even if there's nobody around. Even if it's just a big tree in front of you.\n\nThere are other rules, but these are usually the three you're reminded to follow. I personally follow the first 3 rules diligently when I go hiking, but not for the same reasons *(at least that's what I convince myself to believe)* \n\nPretty sure other cultures have the same \"creatures\" in their folklore.\n\nEDIT:\nThe fourth rule is what I usually do when I have this overbearing feeling that something is watching me. It rarely happens but sometimes when I go to virgin rainforests, I have this feeling that my presence is unwanted at certain areas. Usually when I do ask for permission in that situation, the feeling just go away, as if the eyes went somewhere else. Maybe it's just my brain or maybe it's actually something, I don't know. There are times I don't know what to believe.",

Depending on the area, if you take without permission, your car may break or not start until the object is discarded. Unrelated to rocks, once my mother and her kumu was allowed into an older area of forest to gather some plant material. Permission was asked, but after a while a negative feeling was felt and they decided that \u02bbit\u02bb decided they had gathered enough and needed to be on their way, and so they left. The owner of the property considers the ground sacred. Sometimes I wonder if some things I\u02bbve heard about and seen may be assumed to be spiritual and may be more extraterrestrial interference, like the (very) fast things of bright lights I\u02bbve seen (my people think them fireball spirits, but I wonder if they\u02bbre some sort of information recording probes). As for the whole thing about continental dragons.. I like the think that by comparing cultures, especially before they became exposed to each other, we may reveal some vague truths or past truths (maybe we hunted them to death, like Braveheart?)... I\u02bbm even willing to believe beings chose to live here and may originally be \u02bbfrom the sky\u02bb and have adapted to undetected coexistence among their prey or subjects of study. We\u02bbll never know until one decides to go friendly, but that\u02bbs unlikely since their lack of exposure is likely their greatest defense. If they exist, the abilities of inducing hallucinations and camouflage they posses may be natural and/or technological and way over our heads [on the food chain]. But I also believe over the ages our earth has attracted many species for many purposes, though I wish the friendlies would rethink us worthy of communication (and not just with government leaders). I still believe in a spiritual realm, but I do wonder if the two get mixed due to the possibility of externally induced \u02bbhallucinations\u02bb that make their way into human history and myth if they\u02bbve been around for a long time.",

Spare gas, the works.\n\nI was a good 20 miles into the woods, cutting through old southern plantation land like I owned it. It's about 2 or 3 PM when I decide to stop and drink some Gatorade that I packed, and pee.\n\nAs I walked back towards my motorcycle after relieving myself, suddenly everything went quite. That wouldn't have spooked me enough to stop me in my tracks, but what did spook me was that the air got \"heavy\". It's hard to describe, but it was like an overwhelming fear that said, \"Stand still. You are in danger.\" \n\nThere was a large rock to my left and I stepped over to it and sat down. I guess you might say I was assessing the situation, but at the same time I felt stuck on an island, susceptible to some sort of storm coming my way. I remember looking at my motorcycle and part of me screaming to myself, \"Just get on the bike and GO!!!!\" I couldn't move. The silence was so deafening that it sounded like a howl. I know that makes no sense, but it was a silent howl. So silent it was disorienting, until I watched my motorcycle fall over onto the ground. There was no wind, but the heavy feeling lifted and I felt like I had been spared.\n\nI remember riding for miles out of those woods, tears running down my face beneath my helmet, (I was a kid; give me a break), and swearing to myself that I better respect whatever that was, and be thankful that it let me go.\n",

I used to solo bicycle camp a lot, for 15 years; it's an art of picking the lightest gear you can find because every pound matters when you're riding 40-60 miles a day. One long weekend I ferried from Maui to Molokai and rode the 26 miles out to Halawa Valley. Halewa has a bad rep; it faces Northeast and the valley has been swept by tsunamis many times, killing at least dozens of people over the centuries. Though it's prime farm land, it's nearly deserted except for a couple of strange people that live pretty much alone. Most locals won't go there. I got to Halewa late afternoon and walked a few miles into the valley; beautiful pristine stream and waterfalls; never saw a sign another soul, not even the usual stray candy wrapper or soda bottle. Walked back to the beach and set up my tiny tent; it was windy and looked like it might rain that night. I ate dinner, carbo packing for the long ride I had planned the next day and closed the tent fly and passed out on top of my sleeping bag. I woke up about three hours later, around midnight, terrified half out of my wits. I had seen a small dark animal run into the tent up toward my head, hissing loudly in some way I never heard an animal sound before. I've seen mongoose before, and this thing was too big to be a mongoose. I jumped straight up, yelling, hit my head on the tent ceiling, unzipped the tent fly, half fell through it and ran outside. I didn't take my eyes off the tent; I *knew* there was something inside it. I grabbed my only weapon, my tire pump, and shaking with fear, went back into the tent. I turned over my ground cloth, sleeping bag, and my panniers; nothing. I couldn't believe it; there was nowhere for anything to hide, and  the tent fly was still zipped up two feet from the floor; where did that thing go? And how the hell did it get in the tent in the first place? I looked around the sand outside; I could plainly see my footprints with my flashlight, but nothing else; no animal prints. When I settled down, I made a fire and made some coffee; I didn't sleep the rest of the night and left Halewa Valley the next morning, tired as hell. I rode to the ferry and went back home to Maui. Nothing could ever convince me to go back to that place again.  ",

There are fewer ancient forests here, but there are definitely places where I've had a  sense of being unwelcome, usually the oldest. In these circumstances I've learned to ask for permission to enter - usually it's granted if you ask respectfully, but when it isn't you certainly know it. The best way I can describe having permission refused is a sort of still oppressiveness like before a storm, and the feeling that you need to get out of there NOW without turning your back on the wood.\n\nI've never encountered stairs in this country but my father did once find a track leading up to an everyday door in a doorframe in the middle of a wood. He was sensible enough not to go through it.\n\nI wanted to share the legend of faerie doors though - a hanging branch or a fallen tree leaning against another that forms a complete boundary around an area of space. Unwary travelers can walk through them accidentally and emerge in a slightly different world, disappearing from this one. I do wonder if the US staircases might be a different manifestation of the same phenomenon.",

Reminds me of this story, it might've been on this sub, I don't remember, but it was about a man who was staying in a similar large forest during winter and he was alone and in the only lodge around for miles. I don't recall the details that led him outside into the dead of night, but he went out with a flashlight to investigate strange things he'd been experiencing and he realized it was coming from above in the trees. He looked up and he saw.. It. They both froze, possibly in terror, like they both weren't meant to be seen by the other. Makes me think that if it were a species made to hunt humans, then the child equivalent must make mistakes at some point and maybe that's what he saw.",

Granted, I haven't listened to any on-air interviews with Paulides yet, so he may very well have his own thoughts as to what could be responsible for these clusters of disappearances in our national parks. And that being said, I also know that he travels in bigfoot research circles, and that he might see his job not so much as providing an answer, but just giving us the raw facts so we can understand the vast scope of this enormity.\n\nIt's in our nature to seek purpose; to find meaning or a reason for a tragedy to occur. It can be insidious, and much like pareidolia, it can be responsible for us drawing correlations or conclusions where seemingly none exist. I worry about that happening in this case because the only conclusions that I can draw are far-fetched. \n\nUntil I read /u/thelords_cheeps' post, I had no other explanation beside bigfoot (as previously mentioned), wild men, alien abduction or satanic covens. The notion that this \"It,\" an undiscovered and elusive predator, could be stalking humanity on the fringe for thousands of years, our only defense being an innate but vestigial instinct that something's not right, is both intriguing and terrifying, and the fact that all of this phenomena could be related - from the disappearances all the way up to and including the mysterious stairs - is very equally so, indeed.",

We had set up camp for the night, and were sitting around the small (squaw) fire we had made, since it was fall and chilly at night.  We were set up next to a creek (too big to cross on foot), well off the beaten path, and, as far as we could tell, there was nothing but aspen grove on the creek's far side, and no reason for other campers to be over there (campsite locating and indexing was part of the job).\n\nI walked away from the fire and turned off my headlamp to take a piss at the creek's edge, probably six or seven feet above its banks.  Midway through emptying my bladder a single red dot appeared in the dark across the creek &amp;ndash; I equate it to the REC light on an analog video camera &amp;ndash; and for probably ten seconds I stared at it (remember, my headlamp is off at this point, so it's not a reflection), and then it blinked out.  \n\nIt's easy to fool yourself into thinking \"I'm alone,\" out there, but I will never, ever have that illusion again.",

I can tell you that there are stairs out in the middle of nowhere all the time. We've always chalked it up to the stairs being the most \"structurally sound\" part of a building (not sure if that's true) when we're asked about it. But the assumption is that you don't fuck with them, or go near them. It's not a creepy thing to us, it just sort of is. Another thing worthy of note is that it's almost never locals that go missing- we have a good relationship with the forest.",

But; somehow we didn't. And here we still are.\n\nThere's been many times I've died since then. Something terrible happened, it was all over, and then, you're back to the moment before the event and it just didn't happen. Usually traffic accidents. ",

There was no way I could have survived that, unscathed, especially when I saw the roof of the car shaved off in photos. \n\nWhen I was 25, on another dark and stormy night in Seattle, a car swerved out of its lane and hit me, causing my car to flip over and slam into a telephone pole, causing my car to wrap itself around the pole. Again I walked away unscathed, and the cops insisted there was no other car. \n\nWhen I was 32, my SO and I were hit head on at highway speed on an extremely busy and slippery road in winter in Wisconsin (the other driver lost control), spun around, bounced off the guard rail a couple of times, and we both walked away unscathed despite the car being totaled to the point of being unrecognizable. The cops told us a couple of days later the other driver disappeared completely, and they were baffled as to how, since she was a mom with kids. During the accident, I clearly heard a voice say, \"Can't avoid this one\" immediately before impact. My SO swears they did not say that.\n\nAlmost six months ago, my very large and strong horse suddenly flipped out for no reason and started bucking better than any horse or bull I've ever seen at a rodeo, live or tv. After three or four good bucks, I was launched, as my friend said, like a rag doll, and she was sure I was dead. Except for a couple of broken ribs, I walked away virtually unscathed. No one can believe I did not get any head injury, but all hospital scans confirm that I did not.\n\nI'm sure there are a ton of other accidents I've had that don't immediately spring into my mind. I think your philosophy has merit.",

            "comment": "So many interesting stories on here. I am particularly interested in the concept of 'sylvan dread'. I've experienced it and have never spoken to anyone about it or written about it until now.\n\nMy experience is pretty lame and does not involve any kind of supernatural or strange noises. It is more of a 'feel'.\n\nYears ago, I spent a week hunting with my brother and father in northern Arizona. The tree covered hills and colorful meadows are some of the most beautiful I've ever seen.\n\nDuring the trip, we moved campsites once, and I spent a lot of time alone and with my brother, stalking through underbrush as silent as possible. Less so when we were together, since you generally are not as silent with a partner.\n\nThere was a lot of diverse terrain that we traversed. I never once felt any fear until one day.\n\nWe were at the end of a long meadow, a moderate, but not far distance from the road. Perhaps a couple miles.\n\nThere was a very oddly well-worn 'road' about 15 feet wide going through a canopy of trees. We entered and walked down the 'road'. The road followed the bottom of a steep ridge.\n\nIt was very out of place. Like a forest service road, but appearing out of nowhere and with no visible signs of how it was built or any tire marks. The dirt was clean but not hard-packed like human built dirt roads.\n\nAs we walked, the trees around us became dead, the grass disappeared, and everything took on a strange dim darkness that was not present in the cheery forest I had spent the previous days in. There was a barren creek alongside the road.\n\nBefore long, I noticed the birds, bugs, and wind went silent. The silence continued for a long time and I strained to listen but heard nothing. Even the rustling of leaves was missing.\n\nMy conscious mind thought \"there is something different here. This is an old place, it feels like no people have been here for a long, long time. This place belongs to the wild\" Optimistically, I comforted myself by thinking \"this must be where the animals hide. We will finally bag a turkey here without resorting to calling\".\n\nA wave of dread hit me. Strange branches appeared in the trail that looked like they had been knocked over recently. The trees were completely dead. The grass and leaves were missing. Something seemed unnatural. Like this place despised us, but called to our human curiosity. Perhaps the same way a turkey will investigate a dangerous group of human hunters for curiosity alone (they have been known to do this).\n\nMy brother, who is normally noisy and fidgety, was very silent and apprehensive. I noticed him holding his shotgun a little higher than normal.\n\nMy brother, without any indication, stopped moving. Without speaking, we both stood at a frozen stop. Stupefied, looking around at the dead trees. I remember feeling the need to talk to him but the words didn't come out. He looked at me with a worried look and the hair stood up on the back of my neck.\n\nWe turned to leave and finally heard something. A strange bird made an odd call. I can't place what type of chirp it was or from what bird. It sounded like a whistle, with five notes. Something in me told me that it was calling to us, or to announce our presence to something else.\n\nWithout speaking or signalling to eachother, we began walking, very alertly, back down the pathway to leave this place. The bird followed us and called occasionally.\n\nWithout seeing or hearing anything startling, a feeling overcame me throughout the entire time that I was in a 'fake' place. It was like entering a spiders web but not knowing what a spider is. Like some strange part of the forest that was not healthy for us to be in was focusing on us very intently... as if human visitors were either walking into a trap or were not welcome.\n\nAs we left. We both kept watching our backs and kept our shotguns chambered. I wonder sometimes if the strange things that make people disappear in the woods were there, weighing their options. Perhaps they didn't want to draw attention by attacking two armed, alert brothers who would risk their lives to defend each other, and would make a massive amount of noise with shotguns if attacked. Perhaps whatever it is that takes people in the woods focuses on taking the young, the old, the weak, and the alone. Perhaps the tree branches and the 'unwelcome' feeling were its irritation that strong, armed young men entered its web instead of more vulnerable prey.\n\nOverwhelmingly I remember thinking defensively. \"This place needs to be taken by people. Groups of men need to come here, clear this 'road' and chase out whatever is here.\" I focused mentally on a strength of humanity working together and how if we were lost, there would be many more people coming to find us. Maybe they can read thoughts and saw what I believed.\n\nMy brother and I were very silent after that walk. We never spoke of that place or the strange feeling. The rest of the trip was spent in the beautiful northern Arizona forests and although there are ugly patches and burned down areas, I never again felt a sense of dread.\n\nYes, this story is lame as nothing strange happened besides silence and dead trees and an odd road in the forest. But if you knew me, and what a loud, masculine, type I am, you would understand how odd it is that anything would spook me. I am rarely scared of anything and completely deny the existence of ghosts and other phenomena. It is strange that a weird part of the forest has haunted me for years, and struck my emotions for no reason.\n\nFor the longest time, I thought it was just a strange mental feeling that came at an odd time. Its interesting that other people feel spooked for no reason whatsoever, and that the woods go silent on them as well.\n\nSome day I want to find that road again, with a larger group of people, armed. Follow it to the end and see what is there.",

                    "comment": "Late to the party, but I also find the \"sylvan dread\" concept very interesting. I've always been close to forests, when I was younger I lived in El Salvador, and studied in a wealthy part of the country, our school (Panamerican School) was embeded in the woods of the San Salvador volcano. I loved hiking on our \"private\" so to speak woods, and I never once felt this feeling. I'm not talking about a small piece of land, specially considering I was 10 at the time. My parents also took me every weekend to various parts of the country, mostly to *cafetales* (coffee farms, always in the middle of the woods) and I always ventured into very dense central american forests without ever feeling anything remotely close to dread.\n\nI never once encountered sylvan dread until I moved to where I currently live, near Barcelona, Spain, in a comparatively (to Barcelona) small town. I live at the hillside of one of the few mountains that border Barcelona city. \n\nEvery weekend I go out with my dog, which is an Alaskan Malamute and needs to excercise, hiking through the very well established trails along the mountain. For 3 years since I moved I never noticed anything strange or scary about the trails or mountain until a couple of weeks ago. There are powerlines that cut through the mountain, and with time the trees underneath them need to be either cut down or trimmed. A couple of weeks ago, a whole strip of maybe half to three quarters of a kilometer was simply cut down because there was a huge risk of fire and no one wanted to risk having the whole mountain burn down. I decided to investigate the newly paved trail with my dog since it was very well flattened and in a straight line and I could let her lose without worrying she'd find and kill a rabbit hiding on a curve or something. \n\nHalf-way down the trail I started feeling very strange. My usually-hyperactive dog started walking really close to me instead of going haywire back and forth the trail like she usually does when I let her lose and everything went progressively quiet. It's just as someone else in the thread said, it's a quietness so deep it can almost be heard. I was not even that far from other people, I was maybe 1km away from the nearest building. At this point I chalked it up to the changing weather and the coming cold. \n\nShit really went south for me when I reached the end of the trail. Now, if you have ever been in the vicinity of an Alaskan Malamute you know they are not calm dogs. They are very friendly to humans, and will probably run over other people you encounter while walking them if they are not well trained. I've also never heard or seen an aggressive Mal provided they were not abused or mistreated by their owners. They are just playful, dumb and friendly. \n\nSo we reach the end of the trail, right at the base of the power pylon, and I notice my dog just looking around and slowly backpedaling towards me, away from the woods behind the pylon. At first I thought she wanted me to throw her ball or something, but then I started hearing her whine. Not like pain whine, but like \"i'm-a-dog-and-there's-someone-at-the-door\" whine. At this point everything was extremely quiet. Not a single rustling leaf, criket or bird to be heard. Hell, not even the distinct electric hum that can be heard from high voltage power lines, or the creaking of the metal structure of the pylon itself. Nothing, nada, zero. I find myself unable to move, feeling extremely watched at this point. It's the peak of summer, no clouds to be seen and the day seems just... dim. About 30 seconds pass which felt like a millenium and my dog starts to gnarl at the woods, and she starts hiding behind me, never facing away from the woods behind the pylon. \n\nMy dog, and malamutes in general, do not bark or gnarl at anything except physical pain. They kinda howl like those talking husky youtube videos, it's pretty different from a bark.[As you can see from this pic, my dog is as non-aggressive as dogs get](http://i.imgur.com/asvV1nk.jpg). All it took was her first bark to know something did not want us there.  A huge sense of dread overcame me. I felt despised, unwanted, and definitely in danger. I would have probably shit my pants if there was actually shit in my bowels at this point. I would love to know how much it took me to cover the trail back to the main area because I'm pretty sure I'll never run as fast as I did again in my life. \n\nOne interesting point in my case that differs from practically every sylvan dread anecdote in this thread is that these woods are not nearly as remote. The whole mountain has less than 4km of perimeter and is surrounded by low density residential areas and even has a mine at the top. [These are the woods, you can notice it's not remote or anything](http://i.imgur.com/Yd3YdZ2.jpg). Red arrow 1 points the new trail. Red arrow 2 points a place where there are ALWAYS flower arrangements, like those you find in places where someone died. I've never known why there are always flowers there. The mountain was even some duke or some shit's place and had his palace at the top before they [blasted half of the mountain top to start mining rocks](http://i.imgur.com/2dHZsao.jpg) . I drew a black line to picture how the mountain would have looked before the mining activities. ",

We're no suppose to talk about it either, but I really believe in being kind, and at least passing along info about dangerous shit.\n\nThe first time I came across them I was a kid, out with older relatives. I spotted them maybe 60 yards away from where we were gathering bear grass, and wandered over. I got to within 20 feet of them, and they were made of wood, clean and polished, no dust, no leaves, nada. When I got that close everything went quiet and the light became dimmer. This is funny because it was a bright day up until that point. I looked back and my family, although only 60 or so yards away looked like they were much further away than that. A feeling of sheer terror hit me and I ran like hell back to my family. I sprinted to my uncle crying and breathless, and told him about the stairs, but when I gestured back, they were gone. My uncle's face went very stern and he told me not to ever do that again. He said they used to appear as the frames of wickiup doors or stone steps up large boulders, now they show up as stairs, and they are never ever to be approached. He said they lead to the spirit world, and people who touch them can be stolen away. I've seen then several times since then, not the same set but just like you described, they can be big, small, new, dilapidated, etc. Each time, I lay down medicine, say a prayer of protection, and get away from where they appear. \n\nBe sure to smudge yourself at the end of the day when you come across those things. Even if you don't believe in anything, sage smells good, and it can't hurt.\n",

I posted this on Jezebel's Annual Scary Stories post (which led me here), but after reading all of these SAR posts, I'm convinced what I heard was a water baby thing:\n\n&gt;A few years ago, I was training for a marathon, and would always do my long runs with my boyfriend on a trail north of Baltimore. He\u2019d ride a bike while I ran. One day we didn\u2019t get out there till late afternoon, but thought we could make it back before dark. Nope. Had about four miles left and it got dark real fast. At about two miles from the parking lot there was a bridge that went over a creek...and as we turned the corner coming up to the bridge we heard what sounded like a woman crying under the bridge and saying, \u201cHelp me! Help me!\u201d We stopped dead in the darkness, not making a sound. We looked at each other, and my boyfriend whispered to me, \u201cYou get on the bike and go as fast as you can to the car, I\u2019ll be right behind you. I biked SO FAST and locked myself in the car, and when he got there we drove up a mile down the road and called the cops. They went back to the bridge with my boyfriend...and didn\u2019t find a thing.",

You were facing the other way as you climbed while it happened.  \n\nFor a moment, reality may just feel a little dense, then [a posteriori](https://www.google.com/search?q=a+posteriori&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBoQvwUoAGoVChMIvPuxp6H2xwIVTSqICh2N9wwI&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=6700) memory gets a little fuzzy, very mild disorientation.  You descend the stairs, and welcome to your new home!  \n\nNo one is saying you are going to notice the change.  Unless you are a mystic gnostic who is super conscious of every change in his internal and external state of being, with transcendental memory capacity.  \n\nMemories of where you came from are quickly replaced as the conscious mind is flooded with new sensory data of a fully recursive self-consistent fractal reality.  \n\n'What was I just thinking?  I was a Parks officer climbing...who was I?  hmmm....'. \n\n...And then at night, the strange dreams of an old life resurface. Hope you like your new job and partner.

When I was girl, I would often go hiking in the woods, deep into the woods, my father was an Archaeologist and he instilled me in a sense of wonder and adventure, once upon walking out in the woods I came across a creek, I was way out in the middle of no where and I'll admit I was quite lost. So, I was always taught to follow the water, eventually it will lead to somewhere. I followed the creek downstream, and it winded deep, long, there were parts that I had to step into the creek because I didn't want to lose it, and the sides of it were too high for me to climb. It was on one of these times I had to step into the creek that I found myself stepping across moss covered stairs, it lead way down, almost down so far I couldn't see the bottom, as I walked down the slimy stairs almost slipping as the water trickled down, the sky turned dark which was quite odd as it was nearing noon, and the sounds of life stopped. I tripped, and fell into the dark. When I woke up it was the next morning, no trace of the staircase or even the creek, I was alone in a meadow, and I had markings on my arms almost burned but not quite, I would say they were left on my skin, both arms, if you put them together they are perfectly marked two straight lines. Even 21 years later I am still marked by that day in the woods.",

I've heard the strange man/thing saying \"meow\".  It was in a small forested park in Miami, smack dab in the middle of houses, a neighborhood and shit. The park is really beautiful in the day time and I was doing a photoshoot for a school project. We called it the meadow and had been there multiple times to photograph. Anyway, we got caught up and the sun had gone down but we had our flashlights and were walking back through the path to our cars, we were pretty close. We hear a meow. I had the exact same reaction as the old lady, \"This sounds a bit odd.\" We stood listening for a bit when we realized it sounded like a man saying \"meow\" not a cat. As we stood there whoever was doing it kept repeating it, very slowly and loud, maybe every 20 seconds or so. At the time we thought it was probably a creep or some silly kids trying to spook us so we ran the fuck out of there and laughed when we got to our car. Reading this...now I'm not so sure. ",

            "comment": "I was debating whether or not to share this story because I'm not a great writer and nothing really happens but /u/DEA_agent_undercover shared something similar (although more eloquently written) so I thought I would too. \n\nAbout 4 years ago my girlfriend at the time and I were camping in the Mt. Hood Wilderness and decided to go on a short day hike. To make a long story short, we took a wrong turn and after a few miles ended up at this good sized lake that was just creepy. It wasn\u2019t just the lake I guess, but the entire area. It was silent where as before approaching the lake birds had been singing and bugs had been buzzing around. My ex later commented saying that it felt like something bad had happened there. I don\u2019t really believe in super natural stuff but I couldn\u2019t help but agree with her. Aside from just a general bad vibe we both felt like we were being watch once we had turned onto this wrong trail. \n\nThe other weird thing was while the area surrounding the lake was populated with trees, there was virtually no underbrush except on the trails that wrapped around the lake (one of which was blocked by a dead fallen tree). No one, it seemed, had taken either trail in many years. Right where the main trail forked to wrap around the lake there was a semicircle of trees with an old fire pit in the middle with some litter about. While that isn\u2019t an odd scene normally, the litter itself was strange. There were Coors cans that were the old style without a pull tab, an old glass coke bottle, and tin cans that were rusted out. It\u2019s like no one had been down there in decades. \n\nWe quickly ate and got the fuck out of there. I don\u2019t really know how describe the feeling that place gave me but in all my years of camping/hiking with my family, the boy scouts, and friends I have never had such a strange feeling in the woods. Usually I feel at home amongst the trees but this was one place that made sure we knew we weren\u2019t welcome. ",

One of the hunters shot an elk but it wasn't a clean shot so it ran. Another guide and myself started to follow the trail of blood from the elk. We were on foot and had been walking for a little over an hour when we came into a grove of aspens. Aspens aren't thick trees and we didn't see the stairs until we were right up on them. The leaves were a golden color and the sun was not too high in the sky but the stairs were an almost glowing yellow. Both of us stood there for a few minutes not really saying anything. The other guide looked at me and said \" lets get the f*ck out of here\", and we bolted back up to the camp. We didn't talk about it again and told the hunter that we lost the blood trail.  I've been reading this sub for a long time but I made this account just to post this story.",

            "comment": "Right after high school I worked for a resort type facility that did outdoor adventure activities.  I took people on horseback riding camping trips in the Appalachian mountains.  Part of my job was to keep the trails clear of branches, bee hives, and anything else that would pose a danger to the horses or riders.  I usually did this by myself on foot because I enjoyed the time away from the tour groups and coworkers for a few hours.  It never occurred to me to be scared of anything in the woods other than keeping an eye and ear out for animals.  So one morning I went out to a trail we hadn't used in months to clean it up.  I was about an hour into the hike, just enjoying the quiet, when \nI was suddenly struck with terror for no discernible reason.  I'm talking about \"oh my god, I think I'm going to die here\" kind of terror from out of nowhere.  I turned around and ran for my life back to the trail head.  I finally stopped when I got to the road.  I just stood there, staring back at the trail, and I never did see anything or hear anything out of the ordinary, but I've never been that scared in my life.  I went back the next day with a coworker on an ATV.  Nothing unusual happened that time, and we were able to clean the trail.\n\nAbout a year later, I was doing the cleanup again on the same trail with a coworker friend. Despite my experience the previous year, I wasn't afraid to go back out there with someone.  We were walking along and joking around, once again in good spirits when we both stop and look at each other.  We'd both heard something strange.  We were totally quiet, looking around us into the woods, when we heard a very low growl.  I have goosebumps remembering this.  This was winter and the trees were pretty bare.  One side of the trail was a drop off to a lake and the other side was the woods but you could easily see through them.  There was NOTHING there.  We're looking at each other like \"are you hearing this??\" but we say nothing.  Then the growl again, sounding like something is right beside us.  We bolted back to the trail head, just like I'd done before.  \n\nI ended up running into her 10 years later and that was one of the first things we talked about.  It was so strange and terrifying.  \n\nBut other than that, I can't think of any weird experiences I had there.  I was there for 3 or 4 years and definitely spent a lot of nights deep in the woods.  You'd think the horses we camped with would've been sensitive to something, but they never indicated they were afraid of anything on the trails.",

It wasnt something small, the sound of the braches came also a few meters from above the ground. This keept on a while and they called the Police (mind You, the Police were Communists, so they didnt believed in anyrhing paranormal) So they arrived and heard it too and said: \"in the name of the republic of yugoslavia come out. \" and pointed a shitty flashlight in this direction. Suddenly the thing moved from the woods over a small street and jumped into a lake which made a sound like an Elephant would jump into it. The police just fled and so did my Aunt.\n\nthe next day, there were no traces in the sand by the river exept a broken tree with a diameter of 50 cm which was \"twisted\" untill he broke.

We had flashlights, and we stayed on the trails, all of which begin and end at the same two places.  But we nonetheless ended up lost.  \n\n\n\n  \n\nWe followed a trail for way, way longer than we should have been able to go in such a small stretch of woods - close to an hour, when usually you can walk across the woods in thirty minutes.  Finally, we ended up in the strangest clearing.  It was a perfect circle, surrounded by trees, and filled with mist (and it was not particularly humid).  It was about one hundred feet in diameter.  The ground was almost perfectly flat, despite the land the woods was on consisting entirely of sharp, river-carved bluffs.  We felt a pretty serious sense of dread, and got out of the clearing as quickly as we could.  \n\n\n\n  \n\nPretty soon thereafter, we ended up through the woods and out by the highway, on the opposite side of the woods from where we started.  What was strangest was that this woods is intersected, perpendicular to what had to have been our direction of travel, by a ravine with sheer cliff walls about 20 feet high.  We should not have been able to cross the woods the way we did without encountering it, but we definitely never encountered it.  \n\n\n\n  \n\nAnd ever since then, try as I might, I have never, ever been able to find that strange clearing on Google Earth, or the overhead photos on the county assessor website, or on any of my many subsequent daytime trips back to that woods.",

Coming from what some call the backwoods teaches a person to respect (and fear) the wild. In much the same way that some branches of Christianity teach one to fear and respect God.\n\nI love being out in the forest, but even the best survivalist's life is up to the whims of Mother Nature. And sometimes things are just...wrong...out there. It's hard to explain, but sometimes you can just feel it. Whatever you're doing, you need to stop and go home. It's not your turn to be out there right now.\n\nSomeone mentioned 'Sylvan Dread' earlier. This is a term used to describe the, sometimes irrational, fear that people can feel in the woods. The ancient Greeks connected this feeling to the god, Pan. In modern times Pan is usually pictured as a cute little elven creature with goat legs and little horns often blowing a reed pipe - or panpipes. However, the Greeks saw him as a scary beast much more like what Goatman is said to look like. In fact, the word \"Panic\" comes from \"Pan\".",

                            "comment": "Also born and raised in Appalachia, now I live in the foothills of CO.  \n\nSometimes things ARE just wrong out there.  My BF, who lived with me both in TN and now here in CO and I love to camp.  We try to go out for a couple of days at least once a month, even in the winter.  We're pretty skilled outdoors people with quality kit that we know how to use, and we're pretty experienced.  \n\nBut we went to, uh, redacted, in the Roosevelt Nat'l Forest last month.  Nat'l forests let you camp anywhere so long as you're 100 ft from a trail and 200 ft from a water source, so we hiked out this trail and then after about 2 mi. decided we'd found our campsite.  It was a gorgeous summer weekend at a super popular trail, but we were the only ones there and the only car in the parking lot at around noon on Saturday.  We thought that was a good thing, lol, as anyone who has ever camped in the foothills knows, you're never too far from another camper b/c camping is hugely popular here.  \n\nSo we're getting everything set up, and I head down to the river tributary to fill our platypus bags.  We're maybe two tenths of a mile almost straight above this river, we can hear and see it from our campsite.  I tell my BF I'm going to be right back and head down while he works on getting our shit put up.  I'm pretty used to making mental note of visual landmarks when we camp (\"the tree with the lightning scar is right next to the rock where I need to turn left to get back to camp\"...that kind of thing), so I'm making mental notes the whole way down so I'm able to find my way back up because we're off the \"trail\", as we should be.  \n\nOnly as I'm descending I start to notice instead of the water getting louder...it's getting more quiet.  Worried I somehow got turned around, I head back up to our site thinking I just stopped paying attention or something and missed the tributary.  But I can't find any of my \"landmarks\".  At this point it's been about 20 mins since I left my BF, but I haven't gone very far so I'm sure he'll be able to hear me if I yell.  I start shouting \"[BF's name] MARCO POLO\" to let him know I need him to yell back so I can find him.  \n\nAnd...nothing.  How can he not hear me?  \n\nSince I'm starting to get a little freaked out, I make myself stop and try to get my bearings by looking at the sun and trying to figure out the direction I know the water is (east).  At this point it's gone from quiet to silent, and every single hair on my body is standing on end I feel so weird, but I KNOW it's there.  So I start heading down again to where the water should be and decide if I can't find my way back up to my BF, I'll wait for him to come down to the water to find *me*.  I'm walking and hit this kind of blind corner, and when I come around it this guy is practically *running* towards me coming up the mountain with a huge fucking pack on and this really weird look on his face.  He kind of stops when he sees me, looks around like he's confused or something, and then just says \"I...think there's a bobcat down there.  You should wait to fill up your water bags.\"   We're literally a half mile off the trail, the \"path\" I'm on isn't even really an animal trail either, it's just kind of...places where the brush is a little flat...not to mention there were no cars in the parking lot and no way someone could hike out there that fast had they gotten there after us (we'd only been there about 5 mins before I went to go get water).  At this point I am thoroughly freaked.  I just say 'ok, thanks' and turn around and walk straight UP, not sure if I should be afraid of this dude, or why I can't find the creek, or an actual bobcat or what.  \n\nAfter walking straight up the mountain for what felt like ages, I finally find my BF...below me.  I'd climbed way too high trying to get away from random guy/possible bobcat.  I asked him if he'd moved camp, he said no.  Asked if he'd seen weird guy or heard me yelling for him, he said no.  He asked me why I didn't have water and I gave him the rundown of what had happened.  I thought I had been gone maybe 30 mins, BF said I'd been gone over an hour and he was starting to get worried.  We both went down to the creek to fill our reservoir bags and had no problem finding the creek or finding our way back to our site.  We were going to stay out there the whole weekend, but we ended up leaving the next day because something felt very...off.  That place was *not* okay for some reason.  \n\ntl;dr:  Sometimes things out there are just wrong. ",

                    "comment": "Ok, I just looked up Goatman and now I'm seriously freaked out.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my family used to go camping a lot.  We had an RV and my sister and I would sleep in the top part above the driving compartment (don't remember what that area is called, but it's higher up and hangs over the driver's seat).  One night, when I was about 6 or 7, I woke up because I had to pee.  I saw movement out of the corner of my eye and looked out the little porthole window.\n\nI couldn't see the torso clearly, but I could see the head, arms, and legs.  I thought it was a deer at first, standing on its back legs.  I remember it's head was massive.  I always tell people it was a deer head, but reading about Goatman, it could have been a large goat.  Anyway, it's limbs were very long and very thin, making it tall enough for its head to be about eye-level with me in the trailer.  I remember its arms were out to the sides and bent up at the elbow, its wrists limp and its hands kind of flapping slowly, both of them twitchy and out of synch with each other, as if it was upset by something.  For some reason, it's the hands that stick out to me the most now and terrified me then.  Perhaps because when I noticed them is when I realised that it wasn't a deer.\n\nIt was just staring at the RV for several seconds, then it pulled its arms back against its chest, lowered its head, hunched its back, and limped away.\n\nNo one else saw it, so of course the family wrote it off as a nightmare.  But now I feel like I really need to do some research on Goatman.  Holy crap.",

            "comment": "This second story just brought a flashback of my Childhood to me, I was out Hiking somewhere in the Adirondacks with my parents (I can't remember where and it was the only time we'd hiked there and I was around 8 at the time I'm 24 now) but we came across what was clearly a camp setup by someone as you could tell by the clearing and fire-pit just off there trail near a cliff, What was odd about this is it looked to have just been abandoned by whoever used it as there were several belonging left behind such as pot setup in the pit and a battered tent still setup as a few other miscellaneous items so we out of curiosity are looking around and look into off the cliff and my dad looks straight down and points out to my mom what looks like a sleeping bag stuffed into the side of the cliff just below, We were all in question about it and my parents were questioning whether there was a body or something in the sleeping that was there and how in the hell it even got there, We shortly thereafter left the area and went back to camp out of fear.

    "postText": "*Her skin started to wrinkle before my eyes\u2026*  \n\n\n\u201cDaaaaddddy!\u201d My daughter\u2019s voice echoed down the hall. She was 6 at the time.\n\nI sighed. It was after 8PM. I was supposed to put Maddie down over an hour ago, but she wouldn\u2019t go to sleep. She kept wanting me to read her another bedtime story.\u00a0This was something her mother usually did on weeknights, since I tend to work late. I\u2019m a line producer for a major animation company, helping keep children\u2019s cartoons on schedule and under budget. It\u2019s a well paying job, but quite demanding. Even when working from home, I\u2019m usually on my computer until well past 9PM.\u00a0\n\nBecause of this, Maddie\u2019s mom is the de facto bedtime storyteller. My wife Sheila is a freelance writer. She mostly writes housekeeping articles, but she has an incredible imagination. She\u2019d often make up fantastical stories on the spot (tales of Atlantean dolphin princesses and talking wands) that would make Maddie\u2019s eyes light up with joy before sending her off to dreamland.\u00a0\n\nBut my wife was away at a writer\u2019s conference in Iowa. So all the parenting duties (including nighttime storyteller) had fallen to me. I entered Maddie\u2019s bedroom. Her big blue eyes shined in the darkness like Gollum. Still wide awake. *Shit!*\u00a0\n\nI grabbed a handful of children\u2019s books from the bookshelf and sat at the foot of her bed.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYAY!\u201d Maddie said.\u00a0\n\nThe ceiling was covered in glowing stars. A Little Mermaid night light shone from the far wall. It was still too dark so I turned on her bedside lamp. Soft yellow light filled the room. It felt cozy and warm, not too bright. Just enough to read and hopefully coax my daughter to sleep. There were still plenty of shadows. \u201cOk. What should we read? There\u2019s \u2018Goodnight Moon,\u2019 \u2018Where the Wild Things Are\u2019\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cI wanna new story,\u201d Maddie said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI sighed. Despite working in such a creative field, I\u2019ve never been much of a creative myself. Always more focused on logistics and budgeting. It\u2019s what\u2019s made me such a star at my job, but also kept me so busy. I fanned out all the books I\u2019d grabbed so Maddie could see their covers. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to read any of these?\u201d\n\nMaddie frowned as she stared at the covers. \u201cNo. I want a new stooooory.\u201d\u00a0\n\nI rubbed my temple, feeling the rumblings of a headache coming on. *Someday, I\u2019ll miss these moments, I thought. The times when my daughter still hangs on my every word.*\n\nAs I went to put the books back on the shelf, I saw it\u2026 A slim volume tucked against the back wall. I must\u2019ve knocked the book down there when I grabbed the others. I reached behind the shelf and picked it up, reading the title aloud. \u201cThe Runaway Raccoon by hmm\u2026\u201d There was no mention of an author on the cover or inside. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that one,\u201d Maddie said. \u201cRead it to me.\u201d\n\nIt was an unfamiliar book. Sheila must\u2019ve bought it at a used book store. Its hardback cover was worn and dented. Part of the spine had peeled off.\u00a0\n\n\u201cRead me the story, Daddy!\u201d \n\n\u201cAlright. Ok. What\u2019s the magic word?\u201d I asked, coming back to her bed.\u00a0\n\n\u201cPleeeeeeeaaaasse,\u201d Maddie said, giving me the biggest, brightest smile she could muster. She was too cute for her own good and she was starting to realize she could use it to her advantage.\u00a0\n\nI sat back on the bed, my back slightly turned towards my daughter. In the lamp light I could finally study the book\u2019s cover. It showed a silly-looking raccoon running through the suburbs on a moonlit night. The homes reminded me a bit of our neighborhood.\u00a0  \n\u201cOk. Ready? Lie back down now.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMaddie slid beneath the covers until only her head peeked out.\u00a0\n\nI turned to the first page. It showed the raccoon inside a treehouse with two bigger raccoons. \u201cRalph the Raccoon lived in a treehouse with his parents\u2026 \u2018You need to finish your homework,\u2019 his Mom said\u2026\u201d\u00a0The story was pretty cliche. Ralph was this child raccoon who hated going to school and following his parents\u2019 orders. He wished that he could just \u201cgrow-up\u201d already. \u201cWhen I\u2019m bigger and older, I can do whatever I want,\u201d the raccoon declares at one point. If only that were true.\u00a0\n\nI didn\u2019t notice anything odd until I got to a page where Ralph runs away from home late one night. There\u2019s this illustration showing him scurrying through the suburbs beneath the moon. It\u2019s similar to the book\u2019s cover, but for one key difference. There\u2019s a light coming from a window in one of the homes. And standing at the window is this Human Silhouette, pitch black against the bright yellow light. The person appears to be watching Ralph.\u00a0My eyes immediately went to the image. It was so odd and sinister for a children\u2019s book. It took me right out of the story\u2014\u00a0\n\n\u201cDad?\u201d\n\nI looked up. Maddie was still awake, still listening. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou stopped reading.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 Sorry.\u201d I patted my daughter\u2019s head. It felt larger than before. Not only that, her face looked\u2026 different. I stared at her for a moment, trying to figure out what was wrong. Did she do something with her hair? \u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, honey.\u201d I rubbed my eyes. Maddie was still there, still cute as a button. Must\u2019ve been a trick of the light and my oncoming headache messing with my mind. I needed to cut back on the late nights working. There were some days where I spent 12 hours straight staring at a computer screen.\u00a0\n\nI turned back to the book. Ralph had entered a dark forest. The raccoon appeared so small amid a vast expanse of trees on a two-page spread. The art was quite impressive and realistic. Almost like looking at a real forest. I stared at the pages. My eyes went to the far left corner. There, I saw the same Humanoid figure. He was watching Ralph. The person had a male body, but no discernible features. His whole figure appeared to be made of static. The Static Man. The name just popped into my head and stuck there, like a piece of food stuck between your teeth. Though it was just an illustration, the Static Man was clearly walking towards Ralph in the image. Oddly, there was no mention of the strange figure in the book\u2019s text. The anonymous author only mentioned how Ralph had gotten lost in the woods and couldn\u2019t find his way back home.\u00a0\n\nI flipped ahead. Each new page showed the Static Man getting closer and closer to Ralph in the forest. Until it was right on top of him\u2014\n\n\u201cDaddy? What\u2019s happening?\u201d A deep voice asked. I felt long legs brush against my back.\u00a0\n\nI turned to look at Maddie and immediately dropped the book. For a second, I thought a stranger had broken into the house.\u00a0I almost screamed before I recognized her\u2026\u00a0\n\nMaddie had grown. She was at least 13 years old! Her voice squeaked as she continued talking. \u201cI feel soo strange?\u201d\n\nI just sat there, mouth open in shock. My little girl had aged years in a matter of seconds. Her lanky frame was longer than the bed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d I stammered. This must be a nightmare. It\u2019s impossible. \n\nA bright red spot bloomed across the Little Mermaid bedspread. \u201cDaddy! Help. I\u2019m dying.\u201d Tears clouded her eyes. The blood was coming from between her legs. Her first period.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok. That\u2014 that\u2019s normal,\u201d I said, getting up. \u201cLemme grab a towel.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo. Don\u2019t leave me.\u201d \n\nI ran from the bedroom, rubbing my eyes. Surely my mind had broken from reality due to my hectic work schedule. This isn\u2019t real. This is bullshit. Wake up! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWAKE UP! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNothing. I was still in the hallway outside Maddie\u2019s room. \n\nI could still hear my daughter crying. \n\n\u201cDaddy. Please come back. Pleeeeeaaase\u2026 I said the magic word.\u201d \n\nI ran to the nearest bathroom and grabbed a hand towel. But something stopped me.   \n\nThis is an emergency. *Call 911, you IDIOT!* The warning was screaming in my head. I pulled out my cellphone. My shaky fingers hovered over the Emergency Call button on my iPhone. I pressed it. Ring. Ring. Ri\u2014\n\n\u201c911 where\u2019s your emergency?\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2014 My daughter\u2014 She\u2019s\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cSir\u2026 Sir? Can you tell me your location?\u201d\n\nWhat could I say? *Help, my daughter is growing up too fast. She\u2019s aging right before my eyes?* I\u2019d sound like a crazy person, or worse, a prank caller wasting the police department\u2019s time.  \n\nI hung up the phone. Grabbed the towel. Maddie was screaming, her voice hoarse and strained. I was not prepared for what I saw when I returned to her bedroom. \n\nMaddie was an old woman, decades older than myself. Her strawberry blonde hair had turned gray. Her body was curled and crooked. Her skin had folded into a thousand wrinkles. Liver spots had appeared on her frail hands. She reached out to me as I rushed inside. \n\n\u201cHelp\u2026 me\u2026\u201d Maddie\u2019s voice was nothing more than a whimper. She looked to be a hundred, but I could still hear the 6-year-old girl underneath. Her arm dropped and her face slackened. Then, I saw the light leave her gray-blue eyes. \n\nI dropped the towel, choking on a sob. My knees buckled, sending me crashing to the carpeted floor. I lay there, curled in a ball, crying for God knows how long. Eventually, my tears ran dry. \n\nEventually, I noticed the book was lying next to me. I\u2019d dropped it beside the bed earlier and the pages had flipped all the way to the end. I stared long and hard at that last page. It showed the Static Man looming over Ralph the Raccoon (now gray-haired and withered). The humanoid creature had grown a giant inky mouth, like a black hole. It was sucking Ralph into its pitch dark vortex. And there was text at the bottom. Some invisible force compelled me to read it aloud: \n\n*\u201cNo matter how far Ralph ran, he could never escape the Static Man.\u201d*",

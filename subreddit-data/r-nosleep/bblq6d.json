    "postText": "*This is not my child.*\n\nThat was all I could think. \n\n\u201cHoney?\u201d said my husband. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is this?\u201d I said, staring at the little girl I\u2019d never seen before, standing in my house, dressed in my daughter\u2019s clothes. \u201cWhere is Liza?\u201d\n\nMy husband gave me a worried look, and the girl-who-was-not-Liza looked positively terrified. \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said my husband. \u201cAre you feeling all right?\u201d\n\n*Why was he evading my question? Why couldn\u2019t he just answer?* I took a deep breath, tried to remain calm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be all right,\u201d I said, \u201cas soon as you tell me where my daughter is.\u201d\n\nMy husband frowned, and the little girl\u2019s eyes welled up with moisture. My husband placed a protective hand over her shoulder, and leaned down to whisper in her ear. \n\n\u201cGo on upstairs, honey,\u201d he said. \u201cMommy\u2019s not feeling well.\u201d\n\nThe girl wasted no time in doing what he said. She clutched her schoolbooks to her chest and barreled past me, rushing up the stairs. I heard the door of my daughter\u2019s room slam. The look on my husband\u2019s face was a mix of pity and restrained anger.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been taking your medication,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t try to deny it, I can see it in your eyes.\u201d\n\nI waved my hand in a dismissive gesture. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need them,\u201d I said. \u201cThey make my mind all fuzzy.\u201d\n\nThe anger on my husband\u2019s face became less restrained. Well-etched frown lines beneath his lips deepened. \n\n\u201cDo you remember what happened the last time you said that?\u201d he asked. \n\n\u201cI...\u201d\n\nThe suggestion was enough. A swarm of shattered and confused images flooded my mind, like the wave of nausea that comes before vomit. My husband screaming, covered in blood.\n\n*Look what you made me do!* he was shrieking. *Look what you made me do!*\n\nI felt the floor tilt beneath me, and before I knew what had happened, I found myself falling backwards into my husbands arms. Hot tears were streaming down my cheeks, and my body convulsed with violent sobs.\n\nMy husband gently brushed my hair and whispered in my ear.\n\n\u201cShhh,\u201d he cooed. \u201cIt\u2019s not real, honey. I promise that it\u2019s not real.\u201d\n\nI silently nodded my assent. I let him carry me up to our bedroom and lay me gently down on the bed. He walked over to the dresser where he kept the cocktail of drugs that I took every day to maintain my sanity. I swallowed them gratefully. \n\nSoon my mind was going fuzzy, I could feel myself becoming a pliable zombie that could be told anything, made to do anything. \n\nOf course I knew that it was wrong, that that girl was not Liza. I knew that it wasn\u2019t me who had been driven insane by our daughter\u2019s death, but my husband. I knew he had kidnapped that girl when she was a toddler, and brainwashed her into believing she was Liza.\n\nBut, most importantly, I knew that if I didn\u2019t take my pills, if I shattered his precariously built illusion, that he would kill the girl and start all over again.\n\nJust like he did the last time.\n\n[x](http://reddit.com/r/lifeisstrangemetoo)",

I mean, sure kids have sibling rivalry - I just took it to another level. My mom always wanted two kids, a boy and a girl. I reasoned she couldn't have the girl, so she created me or had me created. She didn't want me to feel different, so it was a secret. She loved my brother more, since he was real - she couldn't help it. That's why she treated my brother differently than I. He acted like he knew, too. Always putting it in my face that he was better, somehow, even though I was clearly smarter. Why else would she prefer him? Why would he think he was better than I? I wasn't like anyone else, really. For one thing I was talented. I could do a cartwheel, a somersault, count to one-hundred and I pooped. I was pretty sure no one else did that - especially the poop thing. I must be an A.I.. It was a perfect explanation.",

They didn\u2019t really know what it was so she wasn\u2019t treated until we were grown. I remember my little sister and I walking home from school, openly discussing which mom would be there to greet us when we got home. \n\nBeing her older brother I would always enter first. I would do my best to protect her if the angry and violent mom was home. My sister was always frightened so if angry mom was home I would always get her attention and my sister could then sneak by and into her room. Surprisingly, it worked most of the time. And the welts from the belt only hurt for a short time. \n\nShe would eventually flip to the kind and caring mother that she was by nature and apologize to me and usually buy us ice cream. And when dad came home from work we were safe. My little  sister would then come out and we\u2019d watch tv and play like normal kids. And we\u2019d look like a normal family. It really is bizarre to think about today.",

We would come home from school &amp; had to guess which mother we were gonna have that day. It\u2019s a terrible feeling. I remember waiting anxiously for my Dad to get home at the end of the week (he was a truck driver) because my brother and I were so scared of her. It all got worse when she started using crystal meth. We used to call him and beg him to come home. He would eventually quit that job and do local routes, thank goodness. They got divorced and we lived with our dad. I\u2019d hate to go back to my childhood. I\u2019m sorry you went through the same thing.",

And sometimes we\u2019d come home from school and she\u2019d be passed out. We were little and didn\u2019t know how to check if she was alive. But frankly, we were relieved on those days. Dad would come home from work and I\u2019d help him put her to bed as best I could. \n\nBut I learned about street drugs when I was 11 and became quite the little addict. And by the time we were teenagers she got a job and we didn\u2019t have to deal with it very much anymore. And then dad was always home and he would intervene. And the last ten years of her life she was very sick and actually lived with my sister and her husband. He was a career Marine. And after he retired from the Corps he worked civil service and actually claimed her as a dependent so she had good insurance. He\u2019s passed on now but she married a good man and he stepped up to the plate and took care of a woman who was a mess and he didn\u2019t really know. He called her mom. And he earned that right.  \n\nOur childhood was fucked up but we did pretty good as adults.  I had a rough go of it but eventually got my shit together. I\u2019ll retire in a couple of years and will probably move close to her then. I could retire now, I\u2019m already drawing social security and I have a pension from my municipal job but I really enjoy my job and the people I work with. But Hell, we\u2019ve always taken care of each other. So that tradition will continue. We just have different fears today. \n\nAnd thanks for the comments. I knew I wasn\u2019t alone. And sadly, mental illness just seems to be kept behind closed doors.",

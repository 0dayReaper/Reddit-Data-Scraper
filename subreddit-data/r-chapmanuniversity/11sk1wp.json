    "postText": "Hi all,\nI recently got accepted to Chapman for Biology and it\u2019s definitely one of my top choices right now. I toured the campus over the summer and really loved it but I was wondering how the social scene/environment is at Chapman? I\u2019m a POC and heard that the majority of the student body is white but is the community generally welcoming ? \nAlso heard a good amount of student body participates in greek life- don\u2019t know if i\u2019m wanting to participate yet but how is the greek life scene? is it the stereotypical \u201ctoxic sorority/frat\u201d environment? \nDo you have to be apart of greek life to go to parties and events? \n\nOops that was a lot but any advice would be really helpful, thank you!!",

            "comment": "Greek life is huge here. You can have a friend group without it but the easiest way is through Greek. The sororities are lovely and crazy about never hazing\u2026the frats not so much. The frats aren\u2019t bad per say but if you\u2019re joining one, be really sure you want to join. If you\u2019re a girl, you can go to whatever frat parties you want, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in a sorority. If you\u2019re a guy, you won\u2019t be getting into any of the parties but it\u2019s like that on every college campus in the US. There are a ton of charity events that Greek life puts on that you can buy tickets to. These events can be pretty fun to watch and there is the possibility you might meet someone at one. Go to a bunch of club meetings, talk to people in your classes and you\u2019ll be fine.",

            "comment": "Freshman/sophomore year for me was kinda rough, though to be fair those were peak Covid years. By junior year though, I went from having just like a couple friends to being in a whole group of friends. The friends I met were very accepting, and I think it all just depends on who you reach out to\u2014 with the key being making sure to reach out! Talk to classmates/club mates/whatever else, just put yourself out there. I\u2019m not in a frat but Greek life is definitely option, and one my friends had good things to say about being in a frat (before it got disbanded\u2026 yeah classic frat behavior). Overall I\u2019ve really had a good time here, my final piece of advice would just be to say yes to hanging out at every opportunity you get, eventually you will find people you vibe with :)",

I had a friend group before joining a sorority, and my friends just expanded after even just doing recruitment because i got to talk to so many people. The thing about chapman, there is literally all types of people here, theres jusr small groups of them rather than large groups of them like in big schools. I did struggle a good amount with culture shock and the beginning of my time here, but having good friends as a support system and always keeping in touch with my parents has helped me out a lot.",

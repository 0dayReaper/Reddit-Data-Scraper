            "comment": "&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl,dr: Chapman has a great business school with grat opportunities, and it is well-loved and well-funded by the university. However, GPA deflation policies can be annoying.\n\nHello! Junior (nearly Senior) Business Admin/Accounting major here! Overall, I can say my time in the program has been a good expereince. The professors (on average) have been passable at least but incredible at best. The career center is incredibly active and holds tons (like maybe 4 or 5 a week on average once the semester gets going) of career events for all different sectors of business. In my opinion, the business school is really where Chapman's local connections really shine (second only to Dodge, probably) because of its main donor, George Argyros's connections put the school on the map. There are a wealth of internships advetised  to Chapman business students over Handshake, and recuritiers from all sorts of businesses come to recruit directly over the year as well. Additionally, it is second only to Dodge in terms of university funding, meaning the program is consistently bettering itself. \n\nI will say the biggest downside probably is their policies revolving around GPA deflation. The business school sees itself as an \"up and comer\" in the world of business schools and hopes to compete with Harvard and Wharton and whatnot. To that end, they employ some frustrating policies to lowey the average GPA of graduates to make the program seem more challenging and competitive. Most of the time, this only means that the classes are challenging, and professors will show you no mercy when getting that 0.01% bump youd  need to get from an A- to an A. However, sometimes it means that you'll get a professor dedicated to making sure no one (besides maybe 1 or 2 Adderal addicted manaics) gets an A. For example, in my Intro to Macro class, the entire class was multiple choice, web-based assignments and quizzes. Very easy, and before the final I had a 94, a fairly solid A. However, the final had a written answer portion, which basically meant the professor could adjust your grade to whatever he wanted by how he graded that section. I was graded poorly and ended the class with an 83, a more than 10% drop in the last 2 days of class. But again, cases like that don't happen super often, I can count maybe 3 or four classes in which my professor used seemingly inorganic means to lower people's grades. \n\nAnyways, I realize this is a long post, I'll put a tl,dr at the top. I don't know much about UC Irvine's program, but I'm sure you'll get a quality education at either school :)",

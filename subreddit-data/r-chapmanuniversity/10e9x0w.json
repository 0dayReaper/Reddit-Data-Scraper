That said, I went there because they gave me such a big scholarship that is was my cheapest option (including UCs, Cal State\u2019s, etc). \n\nThere are no frat houses and the city of orange is pretty quiet though of course there are parties. Tough to party as a dude if you aren\u2019t in a club/Greek/sport \n\nYou\u2019ll get as good an education as you want to get, just like anywhere. Has more to do with you than the school. \n\nUltimately, that\u2019s life in a nutshell. Of course there are extremes but for most of us at most times, life is what you make it :) \n\nI hope you make it great, regardless of what you do!",

    "postText": "im currently a freshman at chapman university and im a biochem/molecular bio major. however i am kind of having a crisis rn on whether i want to transfer or not. i honestly came to this school because i got rejected from all the other colleges i wanted to go to and did not know at all whether this school is good for pre-med or not. my goal is to go to medical school and i really dont know if chapman would be a good school for that. so basically what im asking is, is chapman a good choice for my undergrad if i want to go to medical school or nah?",

            "comment": "I can\u2019t speak too much on whether or not Chapman is a good choice of an undergraduate  school if you plan on going to med school, however, I do know that Chapman has really ramped up their research funding in the recent years, and has really started to focus in on and support STEM programs.\nIn 2019, Chapman gained R2 Carnegie Classification, which was partially achieved due to the recent growth in research and funding. Only 133 Universities in the nation have R2 status, and 146 that have R1. There are also a bunch of great opportunities on campus to participate in research studies, which I imagine would be a great look for med schools. Hope this helps.",

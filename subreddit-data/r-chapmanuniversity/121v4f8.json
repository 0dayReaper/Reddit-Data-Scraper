    "postText": "Hello! Was accepted OOS (Hawaii) with a $36,000 merit per year and was wondering if there are any chem majors here. I\u2019m also planning on being on the pre-med track. Also got into UC Irvine, but I think Chapman is more of a bang to my bucks right now (Irvine is $72k/year). \n\nI was wondering how it is being a chem major? Class rigor and all that shazam? What were your favorite chem classes and which were the hardest? Also, for research - how easy/difficult is it to find research opportunities at Chapman?\n\nAny help is great! Thank you &lt;3",

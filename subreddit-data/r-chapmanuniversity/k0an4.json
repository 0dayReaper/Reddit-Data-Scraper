    "postText": "As most of you (all of you?) know by now, President Jim Doti has opted to display his glorious ball in a relatively central part of Chapman's campus on Julianne Argyros' request until further notice. Because his shining, glimmering ball makes such a great landmark, I think it's the perfect site for all of us to meet up for the first time. Then maybe we can walk down to the circle and get Cherry on Top together?\n\nYou guys pick the time, I'll bring some fucking bacon with me or something. Let's get this subreddit started up for real.\n\nPS: Any thoughts on how we can advertise this subreddit in real life? I have access to the film school's unlimited free printer (as I'm sure others do) so if anyone would like to make up a sign...",

However, I used to run the Daily Chapman and I can guarantee that those signs along the walk to AF and in AF itself get little to no views most of the time (especially the small ones) and just end up torn down on the weekend when people get drunk.\n\nSigns are relatively easy, except for the hanging part which is tedious as hell. I'm curious if people have outside-the-sign ideas to get traffic here. \n\nNINJEDIT: For instance, if they still have those things that sit on the tables in the cafeteria, that might be a good place to put small signs with the Reddit alien and the subreddit name. When I lived in the dorms I always used to read those silly signs while eating.",

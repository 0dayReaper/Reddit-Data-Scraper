    "postText": "Hi all, I'm a current high school senior, who unfortunately was not accepted into Chapman for this fall. Chapman was (still is) my dream school so I have appealed, though I understand the chances are slim.\n\nMy questions is how early can one apply to transfer into Chapman? I am thinking of attending CSUN and then trying to transfer as soon as possible. I want to major in creative producing or screenwriting within Dodge. Could I apply for the Spring of 2024 if I am only just starting college in the Fall of 2023?\n\nThanks, any help would be appreciated!",

You'll need to take 12 units before you can file to transfer.\n\nBe sure to keep working on your creative supplement as they'll want to see progress. \nhttps://www.chapman.edu/dodge/apply/undergraduate/undergraduate-faq.aspx",

You do not want to waste the money at a four year when you know you\u2019re going to transfer. Submit your application for transfer the spring of your freshman year. Unlike most school, Chapman actually wants you to transfer after your freshman year, NOT sophomore. Chapman does not require IGETC certification or the 50% rule. Having a good resume is important to getting in as a transfer. All of my creative pieces sucked but I had a great transcript and resume. Get on as many sets as you can during that freshman year. Focus on learning on other\u2019s sets, not making your own. \n\nSource: I\u2019m a creative producing transfer",

            "comment": "I'd definitely recommend going to a community college, and meet with a Chapman transfer advisor (I mostly met with Aaron Perry but they're all great) to figure what you need to do.  Then meet with your school advisor and make sure that the classes you take will transfer to Chapman.  Your transfer date and requirement will depend on your major.  The only majors that can't apply for Spring semesters are Film Production and Screen Acting.  Someone else linked the FAQs for Dodge, and I would highly recommend checking out the link below and taking a deep dive on the website/emailing the transfer advisors with you questions.\n\n[https://www.chapman.edu/dodge/apply/undergraduate/procedure.aspx](https://www.chapman.edu/dodge/apply/undergraduate/procedure.aspx)\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have any questions!  I just got into Film Production for Directing for Fall 2023, and my whole application process I was constantly looking for more information about transferring into Dodge as an external transfer, so I'd be happy to help however I can!",

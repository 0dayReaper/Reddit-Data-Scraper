            "comment": "My time spent at Chapman has genuinely been some of the best times of my life so far. There are tons of opportunities to meet people and do what you love with the abundance of clubs. Greek life is thriving but not necessary to have a social live. I\u2019ve had some teachers that weren\u2019t that great, but all the professors for my core major (compsci) and minor (music) classes have been good to outstanding. I\u2019m happy with my decision, but then again I\u2019m just one person. \n\nFacilities are pretty good, although there are some dated classrooms. Most classes that require tech have state of the art or close to it equipment. Dorms are nice as well and there aren\u2019t any communal bathrooms, although same story: some dorm buildings are better than others (but none are truly bad). The cafeteria is buffet style and they rotate through a pretty large number of dishes. Some dishes are fantastic but others are lacking, so quality of the food varies daily (there are some things that are consistent though, and there are ways to make them good so you always have a backup if none of the rotated meals pique your interest)\n\nOut of curiosity, what major program are you thinking of applying for",

                    "comment": "Not likely, counsel has ethical obligations. \n\nThe odd thing is that Chapman is a Christian college. Christianity is founded ENTIRELY on grace and second chances. That\u2019s one strike against prof. \n\nNext, what student in their right mind is going to enroll in his classes in the future if the possible consequence is that he goes about destroying your entire future. Exams are typically used once in university classes (it\u2019s hard to justify new $200 text books every semester if the exam is identical every semester). It\u2019s not a licensing exam after all. My SO was a college professor for two decades\u2026he NEVER used the same exam after the semester. And his were law school essay type exams which require a good bit of work to create. But even the California Bar only uses exam questions once and then releases the questions and sample answers so the next administration takers have stuff to study from. It\u2019s gonna turn out he\u2019s used the same exams for decades and that\u2019s gonna make him look like crap. It\u2019s going to destroy his student reviews, which actually matter as stupid as they are, and gonna destroy future enrollment because he\u2019s vindictive and now the students ALL know it. He might get away with a semester or even two of having limited or no enrollment in his sections, but after that the university has cause to dismiss him. \n\nAnd even if the school were to make his course mandatory what are the chances that doesn\u2019t harm uptake of the major or enrollment in the school. You\u2019ll note the university isn\u2019t saying much. I\u2019d love to be a fly on the wall in their counsel\u2019s office\u2026they are likely already planning his dismissal\u2026suing students doesn\u2019t keep tuition flowing.",

If I were in that major, I sure as hell would do everything to avoid that professor\u2019s classes, especially that he is suing an unknown party, which also tells me he\u2019s likely the type to blame anyone he can.\n\nAs for Chapman being Christian\u2026 um, well, it\u2019s definitely not part of the curriculum nor even preached, because our campus house of worship is literally an \u201cAll-Faiths Center\u201d and regularly has a variety of weekly services, including Jewish and Muslim. It was founded by Christians awhile back, but has not been considered a Christian college for quite some time now. \n\nOur Winter Fest celebration specifically mentioned Christmas and the lighting of the Christmas tree. There were also a separate celebrations for Hanukkah and Kwanzaa as well. And, we also honor Eid and Dewali with special events. Most of my classmates are not even Christian.",

When I was applying to universities way back\u2026\ud83d\ude22 was it really 30 yrs ago\u2026all their literature still held with their tradition as a Christian college. I was on the National Merit list so got sent materials from something like 200 institutions even though I knew I was going to state school to save money for law school",

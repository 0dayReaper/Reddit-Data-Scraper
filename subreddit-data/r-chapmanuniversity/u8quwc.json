            "comment": "Definitely make use of the specific things Chapman offers, it's a big part of why the school is so good. The Career Center / Alumni network are huge and can easily find you an internship or field experience for whatever you're doing. \n\nAlso make it a point to go to academic advising at least once a semester to plan out the next one, even if you don't feel like you need it (sometimes you'll find out something or some opportunity that you would've missed).\n\nThe social life is dependent on what you want out of it. Greek life is huge but not for everyone, and there's a ton of separate nightlife both in the Circle and around OC, I'd definitely recommend getting a group together early and going to try new things.\n\nLastly, if you haven't already heard, the cafeteria food isn't good. If they give you a meal plan choice make sure to take the least amount of \"swipes\" and the most amount of \"panther bucks\".",

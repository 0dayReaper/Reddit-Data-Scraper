I'd rather not pay summer rent but still can't deal with getting kicked out mid year or something. Is this odd to have a month to month?  Can the landlord kick us out mid year if wants?",

If the landlord decides to cancel tenancy for whatever reason (being behind on rent a lot or partying too much etc) he has to give 30 day notice.",

You\u2019ll graduate with a BA whereas some other schools offer a BS, if you care about the difference. \n\nI think the range of classes has been nice, too. There are for sure some interesting ones and I\u2019ve always been offered plenty of help and support outside of class, making upper division classes very manageable.",

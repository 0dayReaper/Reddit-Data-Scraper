    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nRecently, I was accepted to Dodge\u2019s Film Studies Program for Spring Transfer. I am pursuing this major because I want to go into film preservation and archiving. I know a lot of people either mistakenly choose this major or take it because they were not accepted into Chapman\u2019s Film Production. Can anyone here tell me what they think of Dodge\u2019s Film and Media Studies Program? Does it feel up to par with similar programs at USC, NYU, and other institutions? Do you like the faculty, professors, and curriculum? Any information or advice one could provide would be much appreciated!",

There\u2019s lots of really cool classes offered within the program. Chapman also has a summer abroad program in Italy where you can work at a film preservation organization and actually preserve archival works. Chapman is great, but do your research and make sure you pick the right place for you as the culture of the schools is also a very important factor",

I also applied to LMU, and the admissions team emailed me three times asking if I understood this was a theoretical, historical, and critical studies program, not a production one. I have lived in Orange County my entire life, which might be the only downer about attending Chapman, but the Film Studies Program looks excellent. Right now, I am just waiting on NYU, and then I will decide. Thanks again for your reply.",

Look at all the courses you would take and even read up on professors. Nearly everyone at Dodge is currently working in the industry and want to help you get internships and jobs",

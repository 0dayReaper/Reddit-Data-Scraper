Personally I\u2019d be really sad if we don\u2019t come back because I do a lot of music performance stuff and most of my music friends have said they\u2019ll take a gap year if we don\u2019t go back. I\u2019m not a music major though so it wouldn\u2019t make sense for me to take a gap year, which would basically mean losing an entire year with my best friends",

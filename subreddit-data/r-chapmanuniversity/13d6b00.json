    "postText": "Firstly, I\u2019m a transfer that is trying to obtain a BFA. I understand that both USC and Chapman are one of the top film schools in the country. So.. without being biased I want to know which one is the best option for a BFA at the moment. I\u2019ve heard talk that Chapman is good for a BFA and USC for an MFA. For the people who know about the program, can you tell me your honest opinion on the matter?",

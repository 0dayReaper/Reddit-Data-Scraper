Chapman seems to claim that early action won't actually effect your chances at all-- with that knowledge, is it worth taking the extra month or so of the Regular Decision so I have more time to make newer works for my creative supplement? Otherwise, my creative supplement will contain more older works I don't feel represent my skills nearly as well.",

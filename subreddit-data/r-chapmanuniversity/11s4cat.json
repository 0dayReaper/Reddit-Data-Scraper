Despite the Film and Television Production program has a 7% acceptance rate, I felt relatively confident due to my brother being an alumnus and me reaching out to the college counselors a lot. With me being a california resident, that just increases my chances. My grades are also good enough for chapman. But it really come downs to how confident you are and prepared after you applied for whatever college you apply for, don't get me wrong I still was excited and jumped out my seat during class.",

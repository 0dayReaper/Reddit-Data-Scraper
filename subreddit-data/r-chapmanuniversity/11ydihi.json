Sometimes you get to see blockbusters early! We have Oscar winners come in and talk on pretty much a weekly basis. Older graduates come back and do seminars on what they\u2019ve learned in the industry. The teachers have all worked in the industry, some are still active (which is what you want). Plus, because we are a small school, you can get a lot more money for your short film than other universities. Plus it\u2019s number three for undergrad (four including grad)",

USC grads I work with have no on-set experience and don't know what the hell they're doing. Chapman grass get hands-on from day one and get to do like 100x more projects than USC. I may be biased, but its obvious after grad that Chapman grass do far better in film than others.",

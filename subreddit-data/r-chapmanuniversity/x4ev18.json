It\u2019s very unlikely your RA cares about the command strips, they\u2019re mostly checking that you didn\u2019t leave your bong collection on the window sill, and you\u2019re not hoarding trash.",

And they didn\u2019t care. Worst comes to worst just hide everything in the fridge, we had a 30 rack and a bottle of new am just sitting in it but they\u2019re not allowed to open it.",

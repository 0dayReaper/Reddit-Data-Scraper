I saw that the merit scholarship is open to both first year and transfer so I\u2019m curious if anyone have ever received it as transfer before? If yes, may you share a little bit about your app and stats?",

I have a 3.75, in both my common app and the creative supplement I wrote a lot about my gaps in education and how I ended up here basically. I also included 2 references (the one required, and then another from someone who knew me creatively). Let me know what else you\u2019d like to know!",

I had a 3.8 in highschool, and I think I needed to keep a 3.0 after entering but I don\u2019t really remember that part. I knew someone that had the president scholarship, they had a 4.0 in highschool, and had to maintain a 3.5 or 3.75 I believe while enrolled. \n\nBut I do not know the minimum required to obtain the scholarships",

I know that the higher your GPA the more likely you are to get a merit scholarship and there are also other scholarship available to you. Depending on your age you may also request financial aid as an independent. I did and had half of my tuition covered without any scholarships.",

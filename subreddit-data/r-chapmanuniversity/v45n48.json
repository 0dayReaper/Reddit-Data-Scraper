I\u2019ve seen a few posts asking about connecting with other transfers, so I created a server yesterday for students transferring to Chapman. \n\nhttps://discord.gg/jqmryHeyYC\n\nYou can also now find the server within the Chapman University Discord Hub. Feel free to DM me if you have trouble with the link.",

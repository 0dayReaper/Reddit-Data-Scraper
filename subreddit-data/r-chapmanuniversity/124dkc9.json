Don\u2019t know yet if I wanna go to pa or med school yet but I plan on pursuing something in the med field\u2026 Is there a lot of opportunities for internships or prep/support for these options?",

The PT has a 3+2 program where you do 3 years undergrad, 2 years masters at Chapman. Also, I hear the pharm school good, my buddy is almost finished up",

All are successful, but went different routes.\n\nThis is why I pre-med is a bit silly. There is no actual commitment. Not sure what sent everyone in a different direction or if it\u2019s Chapman related.",

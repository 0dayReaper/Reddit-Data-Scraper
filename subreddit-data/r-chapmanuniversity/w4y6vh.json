            "comment": "I\u2019ve lived here for two years. Let me tell you these apartments are built like crap and management does the bare minimum. Since I\u2019ve been here I\u2019ve been without gas (heat, cooking, hot water) for a total of 6 days and also had multiple days with no water period. They absolutely do not enforce the lease which means there are screaming children at all hours, dogs barking 24/7 and off leash dogs constantly. The area itself is lovely, it\u2019s definitely a pretty complex. They will give you a form to fill out with any issues you notice in you apartment. FILL IT OUT. When I moved in my balcony didn\u2019t lock, dishwasher didn\u2019t work, doorbell was busted, carpet peeling up with literal fucking nails sticking up, black mold in the walls, and to top it off the entire apartment is crooked. \n\nThough I don\u2019t bring food into my room, I\u2019ve had three ant infestations because there are literal holes in my apartment to the outside.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to ask management to do their job. Of course be polite but if you find anything that\u2019s wrong with your apartment, bring it up to management and have them fix it for you!",

The whole being able to walk/bike to school is pretty nice. Make sure the apartment has workin AC because it\u2019s a million fucking degrees here",

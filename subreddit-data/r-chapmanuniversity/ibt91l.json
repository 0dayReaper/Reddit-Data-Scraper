The strength of a university comes in its commitment to free speech and to academic freedom,\u201d Struppa wrote. \u201cWe cannot simply pick and choose when to support free speech, despite the personal views of the president, provost, dean or any university administrator.\u201d\n\nStruppa also defended Chapman\u2019s commitment to diversity and inclusion, adding \u201cwhen incidents of division and injustice impact our community, they do not reflect the entire community nor should they be interpreted as to alter what is our concrete commitment to those values.\u201d",

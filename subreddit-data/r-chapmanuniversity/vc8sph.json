    "postText": "I went abroad and I really fucked up. I struggled with mental health issues my year abroad. I tried seeking mental help but was denied due to me being out of the country. Was on the brink of unaliving myself multiple times. Depression got the best of me at the wrong time. I accepted Chapman transfer for the fall semester. I know I didn\u2019t do well at all my year abroad. I received my transcript and I failed three classes out of the seven I did. I\u2019m going to get my offer rescinded. I contacted my admissions officer explaining how mentally unstable I was during that year. But I still feel like I won\u2019t be able to attend this fall. Will Chapman revoke my offer because of this year? What should I do?",

They might just consider you on \u201cprobation\u201d for your first semester to make sure you can perform ok. They will also offer you resources. Besides the admission office, reach out to the Dean of Students office as well and let them know the situation. They take mental health into serious consideration.",

Get some professional treatment from a psychologist and GO BACK TO SCHOOL wher you will have structure and people and get a fresh start\u2026 but stay in therapy at minimum once a week (none of this whenever you have time crap, get those mental muscles strong again with consistency!). No one owns you. You own you. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong bad stupid\u2026 just find a health track and stick to that and heal.",

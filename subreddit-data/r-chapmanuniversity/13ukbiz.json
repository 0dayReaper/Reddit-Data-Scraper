My daughter is attending Chapman in the fall, and when I mentioned that she should consider rushing she let me know that they are generally costly. We are pretty much maxed out financially after tuition so we both assumed it wasn\u2019t a possibility. I\u2019ll tell her to look into it some more",

She may have to do some work to figure it out, like if she\u2019s not awarded the assistance each term, she can also take time off to avoid paying dues for a term or two while still technically being a part of the organization. Some even do payment plans",

Chapman has a zero hazing policy, in fraternity has been banned, and a sorority was put on probation due to members being present during an incident. It just depends on your peers, but if it does happen then Chapman will crack down hard.",

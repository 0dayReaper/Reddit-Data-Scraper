I found I really didn't know a lot of the people in my hall, even by the end of the year.  I have a good group of friends, but none of them are from my hall.",

The cost winds up being substantially less, especially if you can get a good deal on rent. It costs less than $800 a month, food and bills included, to live here, and I have my own room.  Just make sure your roommates are people you actually want to live with. Living off campus also removes $3000 from your grant, but you will save more than that.\n\nBasically what we did to find the place was walk around where we wanted to live and call numbers on for rent signs. This was the best deal, so we swooped in and got it.\n\nCooking for myself whenever I want and having all the alcohol I want around are both great parts about living here. My neighbors are cool too.

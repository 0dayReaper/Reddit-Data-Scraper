I just want some help or guidance from someone else to tell me if my essay made sense to them and my ideas were fully realized. If you have any other recommendations on where to find help that would also be appreciated. I am in California community college looking to transfer. Thank you.",

My producing essay was about how I volunteered for something and accidentally ended up head of the department. I did not bash anyone at the event, focused on the good stuff, and talked about how it helped shape me as a leader and shaped my understanding of the industry. I also talked about how much i learned for a couple sentences",

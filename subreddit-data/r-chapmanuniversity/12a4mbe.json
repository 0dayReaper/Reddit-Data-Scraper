    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m currently a student from the east coast in a film major, but I really want to transfer to chapman and hopefully get into dodge (writing for film &amp; television) for fall 2024. does anyone have any advice? I\u2019m pretty novice at screenwriting as a whole, having only done a few for some classes. However, I\u2019ll be taking more classes relating to screenwriting at my current university. Is there anything else I can do to increase my chances? Also, I had a low high school gpa if that matters, but currently have a. 3.9 at my university. Thank you!",

I graduated Spring of 2022 but took a semester off in the process (Fall of 2020). So in total, I only was at Chapman for 2 1/2 years.\n\nYou might chalk it up to Covid but none of the class exclusions, substitutions, or transferrable credit I made was unique to the pandemic. The only thing I had to give up by going one less semester was I wasn't able to complete my minor.\n\nGranted, I'm not certain about the specifics for the screenwriting major as I was Film Prod, but I'd be surprised if you weren't able to do so. If you find the faculty members who will vouch for you, you'll be pretty free to choose the path you want for yourself.",

My advisor and thesis prof were both incredibly kind and helpful in listening to what I was trying to do.\n\nI'd highly recommend talking to any other students in your major and see if anyone has done what you're trying to do. Hardcore by the books faculty will tell you \"no\" quicker than yes, but I often was able to point them in the direction of a student being able to do something as a basis for why I should also be able to hahaha\n\nFor example, in our major, we were required to take Directing 1 no matter our emphasis (I was editing). I had asked one of the faculty heads of Film Prod if it was at all possible to substitute that for another class (one that met both my major and elective requirements). They gave me a hard N.O.\n\nI later brought it up to my advisor and he had mentioned that was baloney cause a student of his had taken Art of Foley in place of Directing 1. Well guess what class I took my last semester that counted for my major and elective credits? hahaha",

If you're gonna transfer and you want to graduate sooner than later, getting those gone will help IMMENSELY. Chapman can be a bit picky with what film classes from other film schools transfer over, but they're a whole hell of a lot less so when it comes to gen-ed stuff.\n\nThis tool was monumental when it came to figuring out what major requirements I could get out of the way from my previous schools: https://www.chapman.edu/admission/undergraduate/how-to-apply/transfer-students/transferology.aspx\n\nDo note that the system is only updated with what classes have already counted for transfer credit. If lets say your school has a unique class that hasn't been entered in the system just talk with whoever your Chapman advisor is/would be and they can help see if you would be able to get credit for it. You'll just need to get ahold of the course's syllabus.",

Just is worth being aware that the more major-focused/upper-division courses you take outside of Chapman, the less likely it is they'll transfer over.",

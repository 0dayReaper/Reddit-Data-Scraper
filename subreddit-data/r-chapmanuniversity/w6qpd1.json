I didn\u2019t bring a mattress topper and they were comfortable enough (though I would recommend you bring one.) The rooms were fairly big, and I would say that you have nothing to worry about, just give it a shot! :)",

I got a singular room with no bathroom sharing but my RA was on the other side so idk how lucky that rly is. \n\nAs others said, two words: mattress topper\n\nThe beds aren\u2019t like prison or anything but the topper significantly improved my sleep. The dorm environment is easily the best part of living there. Bc you\u2019re basically living in a motel 6 w everyone, we all hated it collectively which made it a fuckin blast. Basically if you\u2019re good at making friends you\u2019ll have a good time. If not, I suggest joining a club or get good at making friends.",

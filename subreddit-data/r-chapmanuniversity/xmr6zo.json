            "comment": "It takes a while to make meaningful connections. The problem with freshmen year is that everyone gloms on to whomever is closest to them, only for those friendships to fall apart once they find people they actually like. Try chatting with people in your classes, talk to whomever is sitting closest to you. Go to some of the school events, there\u2019s tons! Even talk to the people around you in the line for food in the caf. There are ways to make connections but it will take a while. I know lots of transfers who are in the same boat! Put yourself out there and eventually you\u2019ll meet the right people for you",

Sadly, you missed the club fair BUT you an find the club list on the school\u2019s website and email the ones you\u2019re interested in. Some clubs, like surf club, are application only and their applications have closed for the year but the majority are still open and accepting members!",

I don\u2019t have much advice other than to be friendly and approachable and try to see some of your acquaintances outside of class. \n \nIf you ever see my dog and I around on campus come say hi! We love meeting new people and I\u2019m always open to new friends! There\u2019s pics of us on my profile and I walk her on campus almost every day :) I\u2019m a senior, so if you need help with course selection or anything like that, feel free to message me!",

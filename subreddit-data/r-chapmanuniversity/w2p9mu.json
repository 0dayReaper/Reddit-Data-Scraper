    "postText": "Hey, I'm a grad student starting at CSUF this fall. I'm part of a group of 4 people, all attending CSUF, and we want to find a fifth male roommate to bring the rent down to $530/month/head before utilities. It is a 2 bedroom house in Anaheim with a lease that starts on the 1st of August. The house is 20 mins by bicycle away from Chapman campus. You may be sharing a bedroom with either one other person or two others (You can choose).\n\nI know it sounds a bit tight but we're all trying to keep costs down as much as possible.\n\nDM me here on reddit and I'll get back to you.",

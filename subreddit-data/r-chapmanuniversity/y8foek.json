There\u2019s over 100 clubs and they\u2019re pretty firm committing, though pit is an easy way to meet people. UPB does lots of interesting and fun events where you can socialize",

Fortunately, I am not limited to just being friends with those outside of Dodge, and a few of my closest friends are Dodge majors.\nSocial Life and weekends are how I imagine they are for anyone else involved in Greek Life, regardless of the major you are pursuing.\nComing into Chapman, I definitely fell into the idea that \u201cif you\u2019re not in Dodge, then you want to be in Dodge\u201d but I\u2019ve found out that that is simply not true (at least for me). I\u2019m super happy with where I\u2019m at within the Chapman community and I don\u2019t emphasize the college I am part of as a major part of my identity (Dodge majors tend to do this a bit more). \nI think campus is a great place for everyone regardless of their major and you will get to know and interact with students across all Chapman colleges on campus, especially within your GE classes or if you join Greek Life or a club on campus.",

Check the Chapman IFC Instagram for more details regarding rush. \nEach semester, there is a rush kickoff and each fraternity hosts rush events in the weeks following kickoff to get to know PNMs. Take that time to attend events and get to know the guys.\nAdditionally, Fraternities do limit the amount of guys they take each semester but it varies greatly each semester.",

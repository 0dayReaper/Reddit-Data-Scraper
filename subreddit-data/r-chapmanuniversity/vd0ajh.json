    "postText": "I'm kind of stuck taking at least two semesters because my parents are being really pushy about me going to college right after high school and forced me to accept Chapman as the only other school that accepted me this year after rushing a half assed portfolio.\n\nI did warn my parents the tuition is ridiculously expensive but they didn't heed my warning and are kind of regretting the decision but are also being super wishy washy and the entire financial situation is making me feel sick, we literally cant afford it and everyones been saying career opportunities aren't great in Chapman for animation.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on what to do? I don't know if I can develop a portfolio while at Chapman to try and enter a different college to transfer to by 2023, but I don't want to stay at Chapman all four years and accumulate like 100k+ debt.\n\nAny help or advice would be appreciated OTL\n\n\\*sorry if this is formatted strangely? i never use reddit and a friend recommended me ask for advice here",

(Also wayyyy less debt\ud83d\ude0a)",

It is a competitive program and not everyone gets in.\n\nI would talk with a counselor over your concerns on how your parents will afford tuition. They have confidence in you and are willing to invest, but it won't work if you think their sacrifice is too much and that you'll disappoint after graduating.\n\nIf you love animation then embrace it and go to the best place you got into. There are plenty of choices. https://www.animationcareerreview.com/articles/top-20-animation-school-programs-california-2021-college-rankings",

It\u2019s a last resort school if you didn\u2019t get accepted to any other schools you applied to. I say suck it up, go to community college for 2 years to transfer to the school of your dreams rather than going to the dreadful over priced school! Not looking like you\u2019re stupid in front of your parent\u2019s pier group for not getting into your college of choice so you settle for this bs school isn\u2019t an acceptable option! There is nothing wrong with community college! If you want some recommendations-the best CC school in my opinion is DVC in Walnut Creek. Professors from Berkeley teach there all the time because they prefer to teach to community college students rather than students at Berkeley. And their teaching style is the same at community college as it is at Berkeley. Chapman is way to over priced! And if you are a communications major lol going to Chapman-I feel sorry for you!",

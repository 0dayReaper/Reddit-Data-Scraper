To my knowledge they\u2019re known for Directors and DPs, while the other departments (like editors, sound, etc) are kind of neglected.\n\nFor Directors and DPs, the Dodge college tries to accept the same amount of students so that everyone has someone that they can pair up with for projects. \n\nFor the other department idk, but I know that there isn\u2019t that many people that concentrate in sound (maybe 5 at most a year). I think some editors therefore have to do post sound for some projects.",

I lived in Orange County and did not see how the other programs justified moving costs. The Dodge facilities are state-of-the-art, and with its new career center, it's much easier to get jobs and internships. Another benefit is the smaller classroom sizes which really permit students to get an improved learning and communal experience. If you have any other questions, don\u2019t hesitate to contact me.",

            "comment": "Top tier. I go to the film school. Huge variety of classes, the career center is amazing, professors are incredible and either working in the industry or worked for 20+ years, overall knowledgeable. Someone commented they're known for directors and DP's, but I disagree. If anything, I would say the departments get much more care and attention and have better opportunities. Also, it depends on what major you go into. If you go into the newly combined film &amp; TV major, you have such opened ended options to try out so many different things. Dodge facilities are state of the art, always staying up to date. For example, we just got a new LED wall and started having classes that teach Unreal Engine. Additionally, the masterclass guests keep getting better.",

Honestly, go for it , and it opens up a lot of opportunities to travel. \n\nAlso alot of students go to cal state Long Beach!! We actually partnered with csulbstudents yesterday and it was amazing and that cal state is cheaper also it\u2019s a popular school, but not in Orange County it\u2019s in Long Beach .",

            "comment": "Save up some money until you can outright buy a car. Don\u2019t buy one that will need much maintenance - it may cost more upfront but it will save you in the long run. \n\nI have one roommate in 2 bed 2 bath apartment. After utilities we each pay about $1200 per month each. There are some slightly cheaper options but you may have to share a bathroom or even a bedroom. \n\nIf you spend money wisely, maybe a few hundred bucks per month on food. \n\nGas is ~$60-70 per tank. I\u2019m not sure how much you drive, I fill up about once every week or two.\n\nWith insurance and other expenses, $2500 per month may make saving money difficult, but not impossible. \n\nIt also depend on things like: are you under your parents health insurance? What happens if you incur medical expenses - can you cover that or will your parents give you a safety net?",

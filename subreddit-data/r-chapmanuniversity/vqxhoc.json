If I take 4 classes per semester, that's 24 credits per year. I can't graduate at that rate of 24 credits/year so would i just have to take some extra classes every once and a while to get the extra credits?\n3. What's the difference between a part-time and a full-time student?",

            "comment": "Hello!\n\n1. Advanced Voice is simply how voice lessons are coded so that juniors and seniors get upper division credit for their voice lessons. So, taking the lower division voice class doesn\u2019t denote the quality or difficulty of the class, but is really only for course progression purposes (and I think tells you what\u2019s required for your semester juries). \n\n2. Yes, you more than likely will be taking more than four classes per semester ESPECIALLY if you happen to be a music major, you will be knee deep in credits for basically every semester, and will probably have to take interterm and summer classes to get everything done in four years. \n\n3. To be considered a \u201cfull-time\u201d student you have to be taking 12 credits (three classes). If you take less you\u2019re a part time student. The biggest consideration for this distinction is financial. You have to be a full time student to qualify for government aid (and I think most scholarships).",

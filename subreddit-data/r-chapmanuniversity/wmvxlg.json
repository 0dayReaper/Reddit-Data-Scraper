Or can we take friends instead? Do we have to stay there for the entire time or can we leave whenever? Sorry for bombarding you, im just really anxious.",

I know a handful of people who didn\u2019t take anybody. The rest of the days are free as a student. I don\u2019t believe you\u2019re supposed to bring anyone to the events besides the ones designated for families but I might be wrong",

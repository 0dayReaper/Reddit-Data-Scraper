It is actually my top choice now. Also, I am from Colorado, and I can confirm that there are a lot of out of state people there. I was in a similar situation to your daughter, I kinda just applied to Chapman at first because it was in a nice area, near my sister, and had my majors. It was probably one of my lower picks, but after the preview day and getting to talk to some of the professors and just how many opportunities Chapman gives its students while cultivating a friendship between professors and students has me sold on the college. I even got into many of my top choices and I still think I am going to choose Chapman. It is just super unique in the wide variety of lifestyles that people live, the absolute abundance of research and project opportunities with your professors that will totally make your resume stand out in the future, and the crazy amount of support from the whole community is what's really important about it. Now it is a kinda \"quiet\" campus but also not really, its definitely not crazy where the hallways are super crowded or you can't find a seat in the courtyard, but it is definitely bustling where there's a really good amount of people out and about and overall just enjoying their lives. I also got the opportunity to speak with some of the students that would be in my major and in other majors and everyone said that it was easy for them to find their people and have fun whilst also having a challenging academic life. The school also puts in quite the effort to make a bunch of events.\n\nAdditionally, the little town of Orange that is literally right outside of campus is super cute and pretty decently priced which I thought was really unique and cool for a college town.\n\nHope this helps! You can PM me for any additional questions if you would like! :)",

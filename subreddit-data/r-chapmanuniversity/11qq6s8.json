    "postText": "Accepted for health sciences. Interested in medicine. Still costs 43k per year after scholarships, while the UCs are more around 30k or so. How is Chapman for health sciences and biology? I plan on either double majoring or minoring in psych. How is it for psych?\n\nAlso does Chapman have single dorms for freshman? I have anxiety and depression and having roommates is very stressful for me and idk if there are accommodations for that. This is silly but does Chapman list the nutrition info for the food? I have an eating disorder and eating food without knowing the calories freaks me out, and since I'd have to live on campus I would have to have a meal plan.",

Double majoring can be done but you'll likely need to do Summer school or take classes during the month long interim each Jan if you want to graduate in 4.\n\nSorry to hear about your anxiety &amp; depression. If you already live within driving distance of campus you'll likely not be allowed to live on campus. Everyone else is expected to live on campus for 2 years in triples. I encourage you to take the dorm tours. They do a personality questionnaire to choose your room mates and you are usually grouped on floors by your major.",

I think they didn\u2019t follow the pref questionnaire this year because they had so many freshmen. Hopefully next year will be better. If you do get a roommate situation that doesn\u2019t work, you can switch if you follow the protocol.",

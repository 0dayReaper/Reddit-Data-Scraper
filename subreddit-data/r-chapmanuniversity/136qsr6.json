    "postText": "I\u2019m currently pursuing film and I would like to think I\u2019m good at it as well. I got into one of the best film schools in the country and I should be happy but I\u2019m filled with anxiety. As of lately I\u2019ve been feeling lost as to whether or not I should continue to pursue film. The only thing bothering me is essentially money. I want to be able to live a comfortable life and make a stable income and be able to provide for myself and my family down the line. And I have been considering a different career route solely because of this, but every time I say it out loud it doesn\u2019t feel right to me. I am also worried about the debt I\u2019ll be in once I graduate. It\u2019s not impossible to see myself doing something else, it\u2019s just a bit foreign. I don\u2019t know. Has anyone gone through this? Any advice, stories, successes, failures, anything would be of help. I want to hear it all. Thank you.",

I\u2019m in dodge &amp; constantly feel out of place and I worry about whether or not I\u2019ll be financially stable after graduation\u2014I worry whether or not I\u2019ll be able to pay off upcoming semesters. I, too, have thought about changing majors or transferring out because of this. It hurts more thinking about the sacrifices my parents have made for me to be here.\n\nI\u2019ve not found a way to make this feeling go away and probably won\u2019t find it anytime soon. But in times like these, we need to remember our value and place here. You got into one of THE TOP FILM SCHOOLS!!! The entrance rate is LOW. Despite feeling out of place, you MADE it here! Out of many students who applied, YOU were chosen!! They want *you,* even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to *hear* this, but it\u2019s harder to *listen,* I know. Try not to forget your worth and value here. But in the meantime, reconsider why you chose this major, what exactly you want to do in the future (and not just something like \u201cI want to make it big and make money\u201d, but think about where your passions lie like \u201cI want to make [a minority] feel more represented in the [genre] genre and [blah blah blah]\u201d) for instance. You should also consider making some content on the side\u2014like short films or videos on YouTube\u2014 to both practice your skills and also reignite the passion that brought you here! It may not be much, but it\u2019s helped me with feeling somewhat better about my decision to be at Dodge even if it\u2019s by a little bit.\n\nThis really isn\u2019t easy, I know, but I wish you luck with all this. It\u2019s PERFECT that you\u2019re thinking about your family, but also think of yourself with this.",

Be prepared to have to have a normal job between working film jobs - I work at a bar right now especially with the strike happening. \nIt\u2019s okay to not know what you want and to feel lost. Choose a minor that will provide you with some hard skills in a subject you\u2019re interested in - graphic design? Finance? Etc. \ntalk about what you want and ask your professors questions and be honest. Editing is a great stepping stone - directors with editing backgrounds are so fucking good.",

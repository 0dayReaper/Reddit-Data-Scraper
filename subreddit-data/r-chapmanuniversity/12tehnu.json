    "postText": "Hello, I am hoping to hear from Chapman students who transferred from community college to Chapman. What experiences would you care to share? Acclimating, making friends, transferring credits, etc. Do you wish you had done anything differently? I'm asking because I have been accepted to Chapman as a freshman. I have some financial aid, but I'm considering completing core classes at OCC or elsewhere (I'm not a CA resident).",

It\u2019s a lot easier to transfer as a girl because clubs tend to be a lot more welcoming. I had an okish first semester after I transferred but honestly, it was way easier to make friends when I joined a sorority. It\u2019s a lot of work to make friends in college, but it\u2019s even more work as a transfer because you don\u2019t get that experience of freshman dorms/events",

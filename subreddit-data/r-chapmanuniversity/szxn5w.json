    "postText": "I have an iPad Air 4th Generation I am trying to get rid of to afford rent. I purchased it last month and rarely ever used it (still have the box, charger, and all that good stuff). It is rose gold and I am willing to sell it with the case and 2nd Generation Apple Pencil for $690. Original price of $800. Price is negotiable. Please please please consider buying it from me if you are looking into getting an iPad. PM me if interested, thank you!",

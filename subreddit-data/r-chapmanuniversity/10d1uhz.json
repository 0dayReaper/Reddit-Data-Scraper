    "postText": "Hi everyone, I just transferred to Chapman and wanted to ask about the orientation for this upcoming Spring. Is it mandatory to attend, or is it something that I can bypass? I noticed various meetings and events throughout the week, but I am unsure if it applies to me. I am an \u201colder\u201d student and do not live on campus. If anyone knows how it works, please do share.",

I was an \u201colder\u201d spring transfer as well, it was the height of the pandemic so things were not in person - but I don\u2019t remember it being mandatory besides the Healthy Panther class (that didn\u2019t really apply either lol it\u2019s like you\u2019re at college now \u2026 try not to drink too much! Mind you I\u2019m almost 30) I went to the main orientation event because I wanted to and that\u2019s it.",

Honestly, you\u2019re really going to want to go to most of the daytime events because it increases the likelihood of you knowing someone in your classes. Tons of classes love to do group projects and it\u2019s so much easier when you at least know one other persons name",

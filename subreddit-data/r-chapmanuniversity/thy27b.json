    "postText": "hi! i am currently having a tough time with my college decision process so i thought i would try to reach out on here and get people's opinions. I was accepted to Chapman for the Fall of 2022, accepted to University of Tampa for Spring of 2023, and am on the LMU waitlist.  I will be majoring in psychology.\n\n\\-if you are a student at chapman, what are your thoughts on the school overall and things such as campus life, location, community, etc...\n\n\\-i am not counting on getting into LMU since i am on their waitlist, but does anyone have thoughts on lmu vs chapman? would just be interested to hear them",

            "comment": "I absolutely love Chapman. Being a private college, a lot of money is invested into state-of-the-art technology and student perks. The class sizes are small, making it easy to connect with professors as an individual. A lot of big employers recruit directly from Chapman, and with the small size, with very little competition, so prospects are great.\n\nThere are numerous clubs and student organizations, as well as Greek life. I joined a sorority and it\u2019s really enhanced my experience academically as well as socially, because having support from numerous other students is very helpful.\n\nAs for location, there is a lot of stuff within walking distance, including the train station, so it\u2019s fairly simple and inexpensive to go places for the weekends like Los Angeles and San Diego.\n\nCampus housing is really nice, some of the buildings even include kitchens and en suite bathrooms. The cafeteria also serves a really good variety of fresh food 3 times a day. Quality is on par with places like Chilis or Applebees, as examples.\n\nA few of my friends are Psych majors and really love all of their professors and the coursework. A big bonus to Chapman, is we can choose a lot of alternative courses to count for GE, so you can apply more required core courses to your personal or professional interests. \n\nI considered other private and public universities, but Chapman definitely was the best home for me. I\u2019m very happy here.",

            "comment": "Hi! I was actually deciding between Chapman and LMU and a couple other UC's and cal poly slo. I am so glad that I decided on Chapman. It's pretty amazing, there's so many resources for students to develop themselves academically and so many ways to get involved in Campus Life. I've heard great things about the psychology program and it's a very popular major. I am so glad that I didn't choose LMU because I think Chapman is easier to navigate and is in a better location than LMU. There's tons of things to do walking distance from Chapman or a short drive and housing is a lot better at Chapman than at LMU. I work for the Office of Admission and could honestly go on about how great Chapman is. Campus life is great, there's a lot of greek life but you don't have to be a part of it if you don't want to and you wouldn't be missing out on anything major - it depends on the student. I am currently pledging the business fraternity and that has been an amazing experience overall as well. I also do research for a professor which I don't think I'd have the opportunity to do at other schools. I 100% recommend Chapman over LMU - hope this helps! If you have any questions regarding admission/financial aid, I would be happy to help as well",

We are comfortable for UC total cost budget but Chapman is almost double. Since we are ok with UC budget based on our FAFSA, Chapman seems to decide we can afford them as well but live on a Buddha and can\u2019t afford double the cost. \n\nGot any suggestions?",

If you're queer or a POC, expect lots of abuse and microaggressions and expect to spend most of your time around people who have never interacted with a person of color before and make lots of racist and ignorant comments. This place is so ignorant and weird!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a freshman and chose it for the amazing connections. I chose it over UT Austin which has a pretty good film program and then UCSD which is a great school overall. Being here for a few months I definitely see why it\u2019s ranked so highly - the connections are AMAZING and most of the professors are all involved in the industry currently and know what they\u2019re talking about. The people are friendly and very talented and Chapman\u2019s consistently improving their film school. We have Masterclasses with people like the Duffer Bros, Michelle Yeoh, Jeffrey Katzenberg, etc etc. and so many amazing facilities in general. I came here because it seemed like the best place to get me a job post-grad and build my skills in a more hands-on environment versus other schools where you don\u2019t make films until your second or third year. I\u2019ve made three already for class. I think it\u2019s great so far.",

Even the process for getting equipment, studio time &amp; film permits is streamlined while making you learn the hoops of what it takes. 50% of Hollywood films loose money so I keep hoping Chapman will add an MBA for film financing to help folks get their film projects off the ground.",

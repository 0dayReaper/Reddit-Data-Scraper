    "postText": "I just got into dodge for PR and got a scholarship that would be just enough for me to attend for 2 years. I now recieved an email saying that dodge majors must study at Chapman for at least 3 years which i was not made aware of at all. Do you think I can still get the same opportunities in entertainment marketing if i switched to Chapmans business school for marketing? A big draw to come to chapman was the notability of dodge as I would be transferring from all the way across the country. Is the extra year worth it or can i get similar opportunities in the business school?",

And make sure you take interterm each year, those are like an extra free class with full credits done in a month.",

I\u2019m a junior transfer going into the business school and something I would consider is whether or not you would have to complete the lower division core requirements (ie. econ, accounting, etc) for a marketing degree. I\u2019m not sure of your situation but this may end up adding on another semester to your original plan of 2 years. good luck!",

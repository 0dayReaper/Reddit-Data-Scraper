I was recently admitted to Chapman and UCI, cost isn't an issue because I have a big scholarship to this school, equivalent to the price of UCI. Im having a hard time deciding between the two schools since there is next to no info or reviews about cs here online, especially with the new engineering building at Chapman.",

Chapman is several hundred. \n\nIf you see yourself going on to get a Masters or PhD then I would definitely recommend going to Chapman as you'll really get to know your professors and the transition to grad school will be easier.\n\nIf you just need a 4 year degree to get a job in tech and want to use your free time on a very competitive esports team then UCI's Anteaters is an easy choice.",

Even tho UCI has the better program, there are thousands of other students in that so getting one on one help and focus is impossible. Not to mention uci has terrible social life from what I heard.",

I would have preferred he went to UCI, but he wasn't thrilled about it, especially because we live very close to UCI and he wants a new experience. He went to CDM High School.  He got into Chapman with full ride scholarship, probably same one as yours. It seems like the school is up and coming. Someone just donated a couple million to the engineering department and they seem to be really making an effort to expand their engineering and computer science. It is growing quickly. We are going to try and meet with a professor soon to ask about curriculum rigor and internship opportunities before we make that decision. It seems like the small class sizes would be an advantage... that you would have more opportunity to work with professors on research. We are leaning towards Chapman and planning to apply for Masters at a more prestigious university, such as USC or Georgia Tech, granted he does well at Chapman.",

The campus is pristine and weather year round is sunny and warm. There are a lot of tech firms located in Orange County and I know of some internship opportunities with local companies Blizzard, Google and Amazon have been offered to Chapman students.. I'm sure there are more, those are just the ones I have seen. They have an office dedicated to helping Chapman kids get internships.  I've heard Dr. Linstead is incredible and has an AI/Machine Learning research project having to do with autism three on campus. I believe he has students that help with that project. I personally feel my son will learn more in this type of intimate environment than he would at a large school.  It is a TOUGH choice. I would definitely go visit the campus and see if you can meet with a computer science professor such as Dr. Linstead. https://www.chapman.edu/our-faculty/erik-linstead",

I\u2019m a sophomore at chapman..I took Spanish Honors in high school..but I still haven\u2019t took my required foreign language for my first year (in college) bc the classes always are waitlisted. I would take it now to be on the safe side, but feel free to shoot chapman an email asking. Hope the best for you",

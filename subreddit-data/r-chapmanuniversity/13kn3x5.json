That said, specialized knowledge paired with CS is as solid a path as can be. ChatGPT and generative AI are going to mainstream- but - for now - have a hard time synthesizing a unique solution to deeper technological problems. They can provide working boilerplate and plumbing, but miss on anything moderately complex. We are headed for interesting times - I am glad I can retire in 15 years, your generation is facing challenges beyond what I ever imagined.  If you can fusion your creative side and your logical side - it works great\n\nThat said, I am utterly impressed by your generation and have faith in your ability to problem solve. Not to put too much pressure- but we are rooting for every one of you!",

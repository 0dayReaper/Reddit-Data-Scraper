    "postText": " Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a Taiwanese student who was admitted to the MFA in Film Production program for the 2023-2024 academic year at Chapman University, but unfortunately I didn't receive any scholarship. I've reached out to the admission office and financial aid office, and they have informed me that I'm on the scholarship list. However, I'm wondering if anyone knows how long this list is and if I really have a chance of receiving any form of scholarship.\n\nAlso, if anyone has any information about other sources of funds that I'm eligible to apply for, I would really appreciate it.\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

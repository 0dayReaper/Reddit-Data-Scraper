Once you\u2019re 21 though there\u2019s a good amount of bars in downtown orange that you can hit with your friends. Thursdays are the day every goes to the D (bar called The District). Orange residents hate Chapman students, but you don\u2019t deal with them too much. There\u2019s tons of food options in downtown orange, called the circle, takes like a 5-10 minute walk from campus. It is pretty bougie tho. Tons of shopping and grocery options surrounding the campus in any direction you go.",

It\u2019s a good school but honestly if I could do it over again I might go somewhere else, Greek life isn\u2019t my thing and Chapman Greek life can be a little overwhelming, because it\u2019s such a small school.",

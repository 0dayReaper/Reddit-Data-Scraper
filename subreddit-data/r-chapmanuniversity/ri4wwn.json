    "postText": "I just got into Chapman for their screenwriting B.F.A. and I'm super happy. I've heard back from some other film schools but I'm mostly just waiting back to hear from USC which I love just as much as Chapman (I have three more months before their decision). I've been looking on reddit and seeing some obviously snarky (somewhat vague) things about Chapman's film program and stuff like that. I see that about every school, but it's sort of bumming me out. I'm definitely going to do my \"homework\" before picking a school and find out the dark and dirty things, but right now I really just want to hear some cool/great/personal things about Dodge that anyone would like to offer up. I toured and it seemed like a really good fit but now I want to get some more (hopefully positive) info that is maybe more personal and can speak to the experience there. Thanks!",

Like major connections like they're on first name basis and bring talent to talk at the school like Sofia Coppola and Harvey Keitel. And unlike USC and NYU it's $100 less for 4 years. And on top of that Chapman gives generous merit scholarships where USC and NYU do not give merit. USC is known for being extremely competitive environment -There's group films but if your script isn't chosen it isn't made. At Dodge its my understanding every student makes their own films and its known to be collaborative. Smaller more friendly campus (not the big rah rah sports school but does have sports).  Some who have unlimited funds may want USC but here's one last point. Last year, USC and NYU went down in rankings while Chapman moved up. Congratulations you should be very excited!",

And yes they gave me a great deal of merit so I'm very excited! But I worked my ass off with USC's application so I'm anxious to hear from them :)\n\nAnd thank you! All of this puts a smile on my face. I'm excited!",

There are a lot of hands on opportunities and chances to get on set, plus time to explore other areas if you want to check things out beyond your major. \n\nFor the small classes, it personally helps me stay focused and engaged in class. It also helps a lot with networking and getting to know your classmates. There are many instances where people will ask their classmates to help them out with projects or sets. I\u2019ve heard of classmates/upperclassmen helping others get internships and there\u2019s a career center that helps you get internships as well. There\u2019s a Facebook page where job and help listings are posted so there\u2019s always opportunities to do something.\n\nThe biggest downside to Chapman is obv the price but if that\u2019s not a big factor for you and you\u2019re planning to make the most at your time here, then Chapman is a great school to go to in my opinion. They really try to help everyone succeed here instead of having a dog eats dog culture. There are a lot of great professors who have been (and are still) in the industry so their classes are really insightful. There are probably the snobbish kind of people here, but that\u2019s probably true about most universities. I\u2019ve heard of a few here but never met them.",

You might be able to take some creative producing classes as electives? but you\u2019d have to check the prerequisites. Which reminds me of a downside to Chapman: the prerequisites for the classes, there were some classes I wanted to take but couldn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t meet a major or minor prerequisite however there are some ways to get around that(although not guaranteed), it\u2019s just a little inconvenient",

The only things you can't minor in is TV and Film Studies, and there is no screenwriting minor.\n\nYou do end up taking a few screenwriting classes as a requirement in creative producing though.\n\nIf your a student, you can find the major/minor combinations in the student portal for dodge under academics -&gt; change of program -&gt; major minor combinations allowed (bottom of the page).

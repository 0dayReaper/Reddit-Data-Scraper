I think it's a great way of distinguishing who's using this subreddit, and it's something that doesn't change over time (i.e. if we used freshman/sophomore/etc. it would be annoying to come back next year and have to change every single person's user flair).\n\nIf you want your major displayed next to your name in this subreddit, please reply here.\n\n**EDIT: BlankVerse said that we could have the year of graduation instead of freshman/sophomore/etc, and I think that's a great idea for those who want it. Feel free to tell me your major AND graduation year, and I'll put them both in your flair.**",

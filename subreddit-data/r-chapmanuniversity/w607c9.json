    "postText": "Is the financial aid office open during summer ?,Specifically this week, July 25th 2022? I am on the wait list for a several classes for my senior year and because of that they have held up my financial aid and I really cannot afford Chapman without it.  Then the online reg system shut down for July.  I filled out an appeal form and a short showing classes I would take but they want more explanation. I thought i could go down in person and clarify. Anyone?",

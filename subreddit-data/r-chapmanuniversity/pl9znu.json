I\u2019m also going to go sign up for clubs, I reach out to people in my classes and offer lil coffee study sessions. I also ask my roommates to bring me along if they go anywhere lol",

I met some people at transfer orientation and I\u2019ve invited people over but nothing actually ever happens. It\u2019s definitely been a weird vibe. I\u2019m assuming it just takes time? But I\u2019m sort of starting to get lonely lol \ud83d\ude2c",

I\u2019ll message you so we can exchange socials!!",

But like someone else said, you\u2019re doing great!! For how nice Chapman ppl are known to be, I feel like there is a bit of a clique-ish culture that feels superficial at time \n\nI do feel like a shortcut u could mayyybe take is rushing for either a professional frat or sorority cuz Greek life is pretty big at Chapman.\n\nI\u2019m a bit more introverted, but always down to grab some contra or study :)",

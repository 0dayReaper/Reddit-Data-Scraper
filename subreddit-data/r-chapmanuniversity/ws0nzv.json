    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI am currently a student at a nearby university (West Coast University) that would love to give a great opportunity to students around us. This opportunity is a dental cleaning and it is completely free and no payment/insurance is required! We do have several requirements for receiving these treatments so be sure to read the description for it.\n\nThe link to our form is   \n[https://forms.gle/w3fLgmJkvUKtv6wq8](https://forms.gle/w3fLgmJkvUKtv6wq8)\n\nThis is a great opportunity for those who do not want to pay for regular cleaning! \n\nOur location is \u200b\u200b1477 S Manchester Ave, Anaheim, CA 92802\n\nThank you and have a great rest of your day!",

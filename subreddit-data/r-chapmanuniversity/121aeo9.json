If you haven\u2019t lived in Cali then you\u2019re in luck since campus is close or near everything fun to do in the area. As for the program, it is small therefore you\u2019ll get a-lot of one on one with professors and can easily meet friends. Ofcourse, it is not the strongest food science program compared to UC Davis but it does its best.",

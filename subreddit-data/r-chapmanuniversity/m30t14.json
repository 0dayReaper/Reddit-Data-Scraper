Restaurants, shopping, beaches, anything else you can think of? I\u2019m wanting to get a better idea of the places Chapman students like to go. Thanks in advance for your suggestions :)",

Also the stretch of Glassell between campus and the Circle.\n\nI\u2019d say to check out a Ducks or Angels game if it weren\u2019t Covid. Same goes for Knotts, Disneyland/Downtown Disney, Medival Times, The Grove, etc. \n\nTustin ave north of Chapman Ave has all the shopping you\u2019ll ever need. \n\nMy friends and I liked Newport Beach but Huntington and Laguna aren\u2019t much further. Newps has fun bars\n\n\nHave fun! (and wear a mask you knucklehead)\n\nThere\u2019s more but that should get you started",

    "postText": "Hello! I am hoping to connect with someone who has completed, or in the process of completing, Chapman's SLP Post-Bacc Program. I have a few questions I would like to ask and also want to hear about personal experiences. I recently graduated from UCI as a Psych major and don't have many of the requirements needed for a Master's program. I've been debating on whether I should apply to Chapman or not. Your time will be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "You already know Orange County so Chapman would be an easy transition. Definitely apply. The Psych Masters program is selective and I think the entire program is ~50 graduate students. Sign up for a visit and meet the professors and students in the program to see if it works for you.",

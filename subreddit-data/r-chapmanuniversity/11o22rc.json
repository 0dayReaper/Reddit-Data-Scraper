    "postText": "Hello! I'm Rebecca, an undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, and I'm conducting a survey to learn more about your thoughts and usage regarding Edtech (ie. ChatGPT, Chegg, Course Hero, Grammarly etc.) and the impact it has made on you!\n\nThis survey will cover various aspects of Edtech, including academic dishonesty, such as cheating and plagiarism. Please note that all responses will be kept completely anonymous, and all identifiable information will remain confidential. As the researcher, I'll be the only one with access to the responses.\n\nYou have the right to pause, end, or withdraw your participation in this study at any time without being asked any questions. Your contribution would be greatly appreciated and help me gain valuable insights into this topic!\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nYou can find the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScD69K1m-WtWlQLCnjMDYrR-fM7t0uyAPivZTvNEreg4CK7ew/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

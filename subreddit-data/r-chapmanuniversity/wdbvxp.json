    "postText": "Hi everyone. I hope this is the right place to post this.\n\nI am a 17 year old male, I'm going to be a senior this year, and I want to apply to Chapman University.\n\nI have a 3.6 unweighted GPA, which I know is below the GPA average of Chapman.\n\nBut I have lots of extracurricular activities: I've been playing piano for 10 years and have earned the Level 10 Certificate of Merit Designation.\n\nI am a two sport Varsity athlete and I wrestle and play football.\n\nIn wrestling, I am a 3-year Varsity wrestler at the 182lbs weight class (these are my stats: 1st Place, ABC District Championships, Finals Tournament; JV Undefeated; 2nd Place Varsity, Northview HS Tournament. Competed at local and regional level.)\n\nIn football, I am a 2-year Varsity player and now am the Varsity football captain of 100 players. The positions I play are defensive tackle, defensive end, and linebacker.\n\nI also have participated in the First LEGO League Robotics Competitions, where I worked as a member and mentor, coaching 12 team members. We won 1st Place Engineering Design out of 20 teams.\n\nI was also a member of the marching band and jazz band in grades 9-10, where I won 1st place for Baritone saxophone in a regional competition.\n\nI also volunteer at Evergreen Hospice every Saturday, where I do administrative work and pack medical equipment, envelopes and packets for medical professionals.\n\nI was also in the Cancer Society of America club from grades 9-10, where I worked to spread awareness about various types of cancers to public schools, showed support for cancer awareness.\n\nFinally, I was a tutor in the Hour Power Math Mentorship Program at my school from grades 9-10, where I tutored other students in whatever subject they needed help with.\n\nChapman is my dream college, since I live close by, and it is walking distance from my sister's house. I've taken a tour there and it's a very beautiful college.\n\nI want to major in health sciences or biological sciences, or at least in the medical field. I would eventually want to become a physical therapist for athletes, maybe even a professional team.\n\nIt is also my dream to play football for Chapman University as well. I've already emailed the coaches two days ago, but they've not responded yet. I'm not sure how hard or competitive it is to get in to Chapman's football team though.\n\nWith all this said, do you think it is likely I will make it to Chapman University? And be able to play football for Chapman University?",

See if there are any current players on the team that went to your high school - reach out to them to see if they can introduce you to an assistant coach. \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CdeJj6_PRn9/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=",

Maybe email your admission counselor (they are divided up by area you live in and you should be able to find yours on the Chapman website) and express your interest and ask questions. You can honestly make up random questions regarding Chapman/major/admission but just establish a relationship and make your name known! Good luck!",

Take the time to figure out if you can afford Chapman and have a couple of good backup schools. Like the others have said signup and attend the Chapman recruiting events. It is a great school with small class sizes so I think you'll do great.",

Like others have said Chapman is only really competitive in film and law, not sure about the sciences tho.\n\nIn regards to football? We are division 3 the school cannot offer tuition reductions and the best they can offer is funding for housing in their dorms (Grand is super nice if you can get in). I wouldn\u2019t risk my health for a division 3 team, but if you do get in I\u2019m sure the team would be glad to have you!",

    "postText": "Hi all, I\u2019m a freshman in the business school. I know it\u2019s kind of weird to ask strangers on the CU reddit but, I\u2019m getting desperate. Long story short, I haven\u2019t been able to make friends and I\u2019m already one semester in to my freshman year: I\u2019m not sure why I feel so isolated- I\u2019ve been trying literally everything from getting involved in clubs,  getting an on-campus job, and joining study groups, yet I haven\u2019t been able to find people I relate to. Everyone is either really shallow or has already developed their own cliches, making it harder to break the ice. I know our campus culture typically leans more on the everyone does their own thing part of the scale, but I can\u2019t help but continue to feel this way\u2026 For more context, also I\u2019m a first gen student of color: so I guess this school was definitely not the best choice given my demographic :/",

Worst case scenario you meet some new people and get to do some fun activities like bowling, mini golf, or a BBQ ect. I liked my fraternity but one of the main reasons I left was lack of diversity and because I wanted to be in a metropolitan city. Imo it\u2019s really hard to be social at Chapman if you\u2019re not involved in greek life.",

Greek life is ok though I have my own issues with it (the whiteness is one). For me a lot of friendships came from clubs, especially activity oriented ones like arts, sports, games etc. Diversity/cultural clubs can sometimes be good if they're not too cliquey. I did theater and got on Dodge sets (I don't know if the business school has projects like that).\nAlso just keep trying to meet new people and do new things, there's a lot of cool events if you look for them, and great people too.",

Dodge is super diverse and inclusive, I'm sure anyone in the film program (myself included) would be more than happy to bring you on board. We'll teach you fun film stuff too! :)",

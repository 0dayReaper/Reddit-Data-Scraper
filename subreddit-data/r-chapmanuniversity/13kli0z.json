I\u2019m a parent and have two kids go /going through college and we end up paying for the summer months too as leases are 12 months.  Some are able to sublease for the summer but it seems hard around Orange.\n\nIf you wait it out, you might miss decent ones and end up with something undesirable.  Proceed carefully\u2026",

Keep your eyes on Zillow and call the apartment complexes nearby to see if you can put your name on the waitlist.",

I\u2019m an IGETC certified dodge transfer and am required to take three semesters of a language. If you get the F, it will fuck up your admission especially in dodge because it\u2019s so competitive. You only have like a month and a half left of the Spanish class. Just finish it out and try to keep up your grades",

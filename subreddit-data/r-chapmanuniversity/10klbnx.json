    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all, was hoping to get some feedback on the dorm situation for freshman.  I keep reading that it\u2019s been a nightmare this year.  That most rooms are supposed to hold 2 students but they are cramming 3 in?\u2026.  Tons of mold problems making students sick?\u2026\n\nI got in Undecided and was told they just put you where they put you-  so I\u2019m particularly worried I will get crammed into a small room with two roomies I won\u2019t have anything in common with.  I was so excited to get in but seeing the number of complaints about this issue has me wondering.\n\nThanks for your time!",

            "comment": "In 2020 and 2021, the freshman dorms were 2 people per room due to Covid. In 2022, they reverted back to the original 3 people per room. My understanding of the situation is that 2 people per room was abnormal, and 3 people is how it usually is.\n\nFor undeclared students, you will likely be roomed with other undeclared students. The dorms are set up so that each floor or wing of the building shares the same major. When I was a freshman, the west wing of the 1st floor was for Dance majors, while the east wing of the 1st floor was for undeclared students. Additionally, the entire 3rd floor was business majors, and the entire 4th floor was Dodge majors.\n\nWhen you apply for housing, you take a survey that captures your living habits and interests, so you should share something in common with your roommates.\n\nHope this helps.",

I suppose all the kids complaining this year was because they were also seeing all of these videos where it was 2 to a room.  I bet many people were assuming it\u2019s bc they took a larger class size last year and they were just really upset to have it be a tight fit!\nThanks for also explaining about the undeclared.   The way someone explained it to me was they would just throw the undeclared people wherever they needed to squeeze a body in.  \nThanks again.  BIG help!!!",

Now just wating to get financial aid offers at 2 other schools to see how it all stands.  Thanks for taking the time!!",

I was actually really excited about UCSC - loved the tour and vibe of school and some of their programs but never saw the dorms.  Then all over social media all fall and winter just kept seeing post after post about how awful the dorms are there and how many kids are literally living in vans and cars there because there\u2019s such a housing shortage in the area.  Like to the point people are saying, it\u2019s not worth being there because the situation is so miserable.   Crazy.",

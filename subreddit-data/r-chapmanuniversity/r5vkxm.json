    "postText": "So I have a bit of a problematic situation and am hoping I could get some insight. I recently transferred into Chapman\u2019s film school for screenwriting. Which is now the number 4 film school in the nation, making this decision even harder. \n\nSo I came into the school with 84 credits already and the school told me I would only need 2 years to graduate, as that is all I could afford. After recently meeting with my counselor, she informed me it would take me 2 and half years because the school wants me to take 86 more credits... Which adds about 30k to the total cost. \n\nI have reached my limit of total credits from community college transferring in. And when I asked if I could take an extra class or two a semester they informed me it would cost 1800 per unit making one extra class 5400 dollars per semester\u2026 \n\nSo my actual question is, is it worth staying at Chapman and leaving 30k or more in debt, or going to ASU and being able to pay for a masters elsewhere? \n\nIf I do stay anyone have any ideas how to help pay? Sorry I know this is a lot, but anything helps. Thank you!!",

            "comment": "The first semester can be really overwhelming. Don\u2019t get caught up in FOMO, because you\u2019ll have plenty of chances to do a lot over the next 4 years.\n\nMake sure to attend the Involvement Fair that happens the first or second week in the Piazza. All of the clubs and organizations will be there so you can find a few groups to hang with that share the same interests as you.\n\nIf you want a LOT of social life, I encourage you to check out Greek life recruitment in the early spring. The sisters and brothers are really wonderful people. If you do decide to rush - just be yourself.\n\nGet to know your professors. Go to office hours. Professors love those connections and will really go out of their way to help you.\n\nIf you ever have any concerns about anything - personal or educational - reach out to the Dean of Students office. They love to assist students for just about anything and they get stuff DONE. They helped me on more than one occasion with some personal struggles and I am ever grateful for Jerry Price and his team.\n\nIf you\u2019re dining on campus at the Randall Dining Commons (aka \u201cThe Caf\u201d), grab some of the chocolate chip cookies. They\u2019re seriously the best. And, if you don\u2019t see any food you like on the stations that day, totally ask them to make you something custom, and they will do it. The chefs are happy to accommodate you within reason. Some days, I just wanted some plain mac and cheese, and the pasta station made it for me with no problem.\n\nYou will hear rumors of the \u201cUndie Run\u201d and some upper classmen like to prank freshmen about when and where it is. It is always on Wednesday during finals week (fall and spring) at midnight, starting in the Piazza and heading around the Orange circle and back. It is formally \u201cdiscouraged\u201d by the school, but being an unofficial tradition, you won\u2019t get in trouble for participating - just follow any orders the Orange PD might shout out, like staying off certain places, etc. It\u2019s a fun and memorable way to let off some of the finals week pressure.\n\nP-Safe (Public Safety) offers a service called \u201cSafe Ride\u201d. Meaning, if you wind ip somewhere nearby and need a safe way to get home, they will pick you up, no questions asked (even if you\u2019ve been drinking underage). You will not get in any trouble or be reported for contacting them. They just truly want to keep you alive. They are also there if you just don\u2019t want to walk back to your housing alone, or need to step out late at night. They\u2019re available 24/7.\n\nBe nice to your RA (Resident Advisor). They are a student just like you and have to put up with a lot of stupid stuff. So, maybe bring them a treat now and then. You\u2019ll also be more likely to be left alone more that way too.\n\nAlways speak up. Ask questions in class. Don\u2019t be afraid to be \u201cthat person\u201d. Everyone is there to learn, just like you. Don\u2019t feel dumb for asking even \u201cstupid\u201d questions. If you already knew it, you wouldn\u2019t be in college anyway. \n\nMostly, have fun and have no expectations. You\u2019re about to embark on one of the best adventures of your life, and I encourage you to embrace it all - there will be good and bad things, but they really help you learn about life at the same time. \n\nAnd, most importantly - make friends by being one. Offer to help a struggling classmate. Lend a pen/pencil. Hold a door open. You\u2019re all on the same path together.",

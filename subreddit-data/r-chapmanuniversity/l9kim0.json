The real cons there are the layout is almost like a maze so you can end up with a long walk to your room depending on where it is, but you never have a long walk to the dining hall. Pralle and Henley are effectively identical, and have a more \u201cclassic\u201d dorm feel. They touch the corner of the block so they have the quickest walk to campus, but you also can have more of the \u201csketchy\u201d dorm stuff you would expect than in Sandhu. Plus...if you end up living with the business kids they will almost always end up destroying the place. I don\u2019t have any experience with Morlan, but from what I\u2019ve heard if you get  room in the remodeled half you\u2019ll be fine, but the older half is hella sus. I know that\u2019s not incredibly descriptive but I hope it helps!",

    "postText": "I just enrolled as a Dodge transfer student for fall 2023, and I filled out my housing application today + payed the deposit. I know transfer housing isn't guaranteed this year, but if we do end up being placed in on-campus housing, do we get any preference as to where we get to live? I know at this point we're lucky to be placed anywhere, but there wasn't a choice to at least rank our preferences on the application, which I found a little odd. Is that not a thing at Chapman? Do they just place you anywhere? I don't really mind either way, just curious!",

I didn\u2019t have the opportunity or choice for preferences which sucks if you don\u2019t want something more expensive like Grand, but if you reapply for housing next year you\u2019ll be able to choose like the other returning students.",

Ex, the single suites that share bathrooms in Sandhu are more expensive than Henley, Pralle, And I think glass. Morlan tends to be for upperclassman, some have kitchen types. Ive stayed in Henley, Sandhu, and Morlon. morlan came with a fridge, a living room, and a sink for dishes. They\u2019re more like shitty apartments.",

I transferred last year and all of us got notified that we weren't getting any housing until a month before starting school. My roommates and I had to quickly scout a place and were very lucky to find one. There were a few who got housing but those few really had to just keep bothering housing over and over again till they got a placement. Congrats and welcome to Dodge! If you have any questions feel free to dm me :)",

    "postText": "I applied early action as a first year! I\u2019m from NY, I have a 3.8gpa, 7 extracurriculars, 2 leadership roles, a solid essay and recommendation, I didn\u2019t submit my test scores, and I applied for the health sciences major! I got differed to the main pool. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s default if they don\u2019t want to accept you like some other schools for example, USC automatically differs if they don\u2019t accept you early action. Are my chances slim to none now?",

Then the admissions team could revisit the applications that were deferred, consider how many regular decision applications they got, and go from there for making their regular decision admission decisions.\n\nNot saying this is how it works or their thought process, but this is my best guess at the reasoning behind it.\n\nHope this helps and I hope you get in!",

It\u2019s more selective than the average school, especially when you consider the average high school GPA for an admitted student is 3.84, compared to the national average of 3.15. \n\nOn the contrary, a school that I would say is \u201creally easy\u201d would be a school like Western Governors University, which accepts virtually 100% of applicants.",

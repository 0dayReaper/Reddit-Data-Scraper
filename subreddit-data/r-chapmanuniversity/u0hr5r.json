Someone I knew had a double corner room (they\u2019re huge and usually quads) and her roommate moved out so she had a giant room to herself. But most of my friends were in triples like this. Idk how likely that is with enrollment nowadays anyway. I think Morlan had doubles but the rooms are smaller so pick your poison. Welcome to dorm life! It\u2019s pretty par for the course tbh",

We kept it that way the first semester with the 3 desks and 3 dressers they provide using up most of the floor space. After seeing how other people had their rooms we put in a work order (you arent supposed to bunk/unbunk without permission) and second semester we had one single bed at normal height, one fully lofted with the desk and dresser underneath and one half lofted which allowed for a dresser underneath and the desk to the side. I was in the half loft, it fit just right under the window, gave more storage but didnt need a ladder to get up in. Our neighbors chose to have all 3 beds half lofted, it was really just personal preference. Like I said, I was in Glass Hall which was all triples, then over in Sandhu with a double room for a year. They provide a decent desk and dresser, you might be able to ask to have them remove either to bring your own, but not necessary.\n\n[https://www.chapman.edu/students/services/housing-and-residence/housing-options/first-year-student-housing/index.aspx](https://www.chapman.edu/students/services/housing-and-residence/housing-options/first-year-student-housing/index.aspx)\n\nMost of the buildings have photos and/or room layouts included",

If the standards changed throughout the years for better accommodations and then when back to a worse standard just to make up loss profits, the school shouldn\u2019t stay open. It\u2019s a place of learning and should help those students as such, especially when they are already taking out huge loans as it is their only chance on getting that education. If a place of education is prioritizing profit over actual education then it shouldn\u2019t exist.",

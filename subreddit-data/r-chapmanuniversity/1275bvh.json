    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m a prospective first year who received a full tuition scholarship from Chapman. I\u2019m super stoked about it since graduating from college with as little debt as possible is a huge priority for me. However, the scholarship doesn\u2019t cover room and board, so my most viable option is to commute to campus (I live about 25 minutes away). \n\nAlthough I know it\u2019s a pretty trivial concern to have in regard to a free college education, I fear that I might miss out on making friends and being involved on campus if I commute. Especially since I\u2019ve heard (not sure how true this is) that Chapman has a cliquey social scene.\n\nHere are my questions: How good is Chapman at supporting commuter students? What are some ways I can feel more involved at Chapman as a commuter?\n\nAll input is greatly appreciated!",

Everyone is all about meeting everyone during O-week, so that\u2019s your chance. \n\nSecond option would be rushing a fraternity, but I think that\u2019s in spring \n\nRoom and board is worth the loans. Great food and housing options",

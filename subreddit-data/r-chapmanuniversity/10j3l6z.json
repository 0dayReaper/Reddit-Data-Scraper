    "postText": "Hi. Last year I applied to Chapman as a Film and TV prod major and ended up getting waitlisted. Obviously I did not get off the waitlist so I am trying again. I got into some other really good film schools last year but Chapman is where I want to go. I wanted to see if there was anyone here who I could talk to and possibly help me out. \n\nThanks all.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone. So I got into Chapman for creative producing but I also got into LMU for screenwriting. I\u2019m very torn between the two.  The film program at Chapman seems somewhat better than at LMU , however , if I am being honest idk if I can ever see myself living in Orange County for 3 years. Any insight at all is greatly appreciated.",

But if I were in this case I\u2019d go with Chapman and just create my own screenwriting minor (yes you can create your own minor at Chapman). Dodge as a film school just keeps getting better every year. You\u2019re not really limited to just your major and can take classes/be involved in literally anything else in the school. I met a fellow student the other day who\u2019s a screenwriting major but is minoring in pr &amp; advertising specifically for the industry. It\u2019s pretty cool how customizable your program is. Additionally, tbh I didn\u2019t like the idea of living in OC at first for a few years as well but I\u2019ve grown to love it. Orange is honestly really nice and I like that it\u2019s right outside of LA. You really get to focus and won\u2019t be distracted by the hustle and bustle. Instead you\u2019ll be focused on your work and networking. LA is also a 30-40 minute train ride away. Lastly, I\u2019d say the community at dodge is incredible.",

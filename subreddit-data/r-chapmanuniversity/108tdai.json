    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is my first time on this sub but I do know that Chapman has a lot of talented individuals for digital arts. We have an upcoming wedding on Saturday, April 15, 2023 and are looking to hire a photographer and videographer. Compensation (for either film OR photography) would be \\~$1,500 for \\~4-6 hours. We are open to higher compensation based on your talent/experience. We have a gorgeous, expensive-looking venue at a City Hall with tons of florals and natural light for you to work with. This would be a great way to add some work to your portfolio and earn some money on the side.\n\nIf you are interested or know somebody who would be, please contact [sb2578@cornell.edu](mailto:sb2578@cornell.edu). Thank you!",

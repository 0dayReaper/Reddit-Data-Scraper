I also emailed the dean, the dean of my major specific school, and transfer counselor basically expressing my wanting to go to the school and why I want to go there. That\u2019s something I think helped me a bit this year and I recommend you do the same right now!",

They also bought a new apartment complex that will be ready in fall of 2024 to alleviate the housing situation. Juniors and seniors have never had guaranteed housing but were always able to get it except this year because the yield formula failed (as did many colleges for fall 2022, because of Covid)",

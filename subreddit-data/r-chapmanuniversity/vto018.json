    "postText": "Hi! I'm a new transfer at Chapman this year and I just enrolled in classes. However, I'm on the waitlist for 2 of them. I'm first on one of the waiting lists and then second for the other class. I know each school is different in how many people drop, so for all of the Chapman students, will I get off the waitlists? Or should I try and join a different class before they all fill up? Thanks!",

You can email the professor before classes begin and let them know you are on the waitlist and are number whatever and ask if they think you\u2019ll be able to join a class. Definitely register for a backup class though",

If you can get into say a GE course but you want to take a different course but are waitlisted, swap will put you in if the waitlist spot becomes available but meanwhile you've held your spot in another course just in case that waitlist doesn't come through.",

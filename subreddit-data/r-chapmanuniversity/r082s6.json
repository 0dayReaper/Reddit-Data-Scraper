    "postText": "Hey guys, this is gonna be a hefty one so buckle up lol.\n\nI\u2019m currently a first year at UC Irvine (literally about to complete my first quarter). Turns out, UCI isn\u2019t for me. Coming from a small high school, the transition was extremely difficult. I\u2019ve never been so stressed out over school, never had such a hard time learning material, and on top of this, I commute an hour to class everyday. I understand this may just be me \u201cgetting my feet wet\u201d but honestly, I already have a bad taste in my mouth. Furthermore, the academic advisors have not given any direction or really gave me peace of mind when addressing some of my concerns. I\u2019m always left overwhelmed at the end. \n\nI guess what I\u2019m saying is that I want to transfer as soon as next quarter. But how do I go about this? Many people are saying I need to complete my two years here at UCI first, but I\u2019d like to get started on my path at Chapman already. Anyone have any advice? Counselors at Chapman I could talk to? Or perhaps do I resign enrollment at UCI after this quarter and apply at Chapman? I don\u2019t mind retaking courses similar to the one I\u2019m taking currently if that matters. How do you even go about transferring without completing a year?\n\nAs for why I\u2019m planning to transfer, I saw that Chapman has this bridge program for pre-Physician Assistants which is honestly perfect. And obviously, I feel the curriculum will be much lighter than at UCI and closer in proximity. Does anyone know if that pre-PA route is a major or program  that knocks out all the prerequisites for pa school on its own? \n\nLastly, I am attending UCI solely off financial aid grants, will this transfer over to Chapman so that I wouldn\u2019t need to pull out loans?\n\nHow do you guys like Chapman ? Does this sound like a decent idea? \n\nTHANKS",

I actually work for the office of admissions lol, our bridge to PA program is really highly rated because junior year you start your clinical hours which is helpful in applying for PA school and you\u2019re guaranteed an interview with the PA school we partner with. Unfortunately, our spring transfer application has closed (email scrogan@chapman.edu - Shannon Crogan - because she is our transfer counselor however the deadline to enroll has also passed but you could start working on your application to transfer in the fall)\n\nfor students who haven\u2019t even completed a year, you can still transfer you might also just need your high school transcripts and letters of rec if you haven\u2019t completed i think 45 credits but shannon can help you with that also\n\nMy boyfriend transferred from UCSD for basically the same reasons minus the commuter part but it\u2019s just more the academic part. I think Chapman is great in the sense that it\u2019s small and easy to navigate and a good school in general. \n\nIn terms of financial aid, the most that we offer is 12.5k per year for merit but I know through FAFSA that there are more grants and stuff I believe also sometimes there\u2019s departmental scholarships you could apply for. \n\nLastly, I chose Chapman over a UC because it\u2019s easier to connect with students and especially professors since the class size is genuinely small. You should totally do it! If you PM me I could help you more also!!",

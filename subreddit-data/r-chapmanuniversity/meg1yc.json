    "postText": "i recently got into chapman as a PR and Advertising major in dodge. but i also got into emerson college as a business of creative enterprises major. \n\nfor background: i\u2019m an asian girl from SoCal who\u2019s hoping to enter the business side of film in the future, preferably production or marketing. \n\ni like chapman because of dodge\u2019s opportunities/events, the major sounds amazing &amp; im excited to potentially be surrounded by a film community. \n\ni\u2019m so torn between the two. one of the bigger reasons emerson is pulling me in is because they gave me more financial aid but i really like chapman too. \n\ncan someone give me some pros and cons / reasons to go to chapman?",

I really don\u2019t know the answer and that\u2019s not a dig at Emerson.\n\nDodge is closer to LA and will have better networking opportunities to the film/production industry which may translate to better job opportunities after college. Also, internships are key and being closer to LA will help tremendously with getting those.\n\nGood luck with your decision!",

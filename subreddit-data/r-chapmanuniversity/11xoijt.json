    "postText": "Hello! I was wondering if someone could help me out with answering this?  \nI recently was accepted into Chapman for their physics and computer science program (I am hoping to double major) and I also received a pretty good scholarship, so it is in my top choices. However, I have pretty severe ADHD and I typically need my own space to study with limited distractions, so housing and campus resources are pretty important to me. I hear a lot about the high level resources that Chapman University has to offer so that was super encouraging, but when I went to their website I noticed that in their housing section, it mentioned that incoming students should be expected to live in a triple-occupancy room, and when I looked at the pictures it showed super small rooms with about 6 inches between each of the beds. I probably wouldn't mind sharing a room with multiple people, but I am definitely a little nervous that I would barely have any personal space at all. Is there anyone who has lived in one of these situations and could you tell me about your experience/if it really is as crammed as it looks? Thank you!",

It\u2019s not too bad, chapman dorms are pretty big compared to most other schools and we get our own private bathrooms. I also have severe ADHD and the housing space hasn\u2019t been an issue for me so far but to be fair I\u2019ve only been in doubles. Another thing to note is that chapman doesn\u2019t have the best resources unfortunately with counseling and stuff, but then again most colleges don\u2019t. Congrats on getting in and possibly becoming a panther!! Feel free to DM me if you have any questions",

However, you would need to go through the disabilities office and send them required paperwork from your doctor. It\u2019s a relatively easy process. They may limit you to one roommate or just put you in a suite. Contact them right away!",

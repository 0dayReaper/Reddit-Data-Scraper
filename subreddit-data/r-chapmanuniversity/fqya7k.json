    "postText": "Hey guys, I recently got admitted into Chapman's CS Program and wanted to get your thoughts on the current state on the CS program. I know that Chapman is trying to expand this program and wanted to get current and past students opinions on the program. I leave some questions down below. Thanks for your help!\n\nQuestions:\n\n\\- How are the professors? Any standout professors/courses I should take?\n\n\\- How easy/hard is it find connections that can land you a CS internship/job?\n\n\\- Other unique things about the CS program or just Chapman in general?\n\nAgain thanks guys!",

            "comment": "Hi, I'm a graduate of the software engineering program so maybe I can give some insight. \n\nFrom my own experience a couple years ago it was great, the professors are either still in the industry (though Chapman pulls more from aerospace than FANG companies, which was fine because that's where I wanted to go) or recently out of the industry. They invest a lot into working with students so it's a really healthy place to learn. \n\nThat being said, it is not an easy program and there's a lot of sink and swim. You will have the resources, but it's completely up to you to use them and they will fail you for not doing so. As IMO it should be. \n\nIf you have any other questions lmk",

            "comment": "First off congrats on getting in! I have a lot of opinions on this so maybe it's better in a direct message.\n\nI graduated in 2012 in CS. The program has changed drastically since I was there, I graduated with 13 other cs majors and now I think there is like 50 per year (there was 1 in 2011 haha).\n\nDr. Linstead is far and away the best professor I had at Chapman. I took every course I could with him (same for Dr. Allali, but he is Math). He has this habit of taking students under his wing, so you should work your ass of to be one of those few. He then tends to bring students back to teach. In my opinion, those that he brings back are very good professors as well (German, Stevens, and maybe others that have joined recently). I'm not a huge fan of Zhao.\n\nI think I definitely struggled to find connections. Dr. Linstead is really good at that though. He reaches out to me every so often to help with current students. I mean, overall if you search for computer science graduates of chapman on linkedin I'm sure people would be willing to connect and help out. In my opinion, those connections can maybe get you an interview, but connections are way more valuable later in life.\n\nChapman is a beautiful campus. It's also super expensive. I walked out with a lot of student debt and that shit sucks. The small class sizes are a huge plus. I found a lot of the professors cared about me. I got my masters at UCI and the major difference between the two schools was that professors at UCI dont give a shit about you (unless you are their PhD student).",

I also was recently admitted to Chapman's CS program and have been looking around for similar answers u/travishummel really hit the nail on the head in terms of everything I've heard.\n\n I highly recommend you check out the [talk to a current student](https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmx.technolutions.net%2Fmps2%2Fc%2F4QA%2FjM0HAA%2Ft.2zj%2F_A5K9A36SDeeQammoMuRRg%2Fh2%2Fu7is37ptsFwVOR9YamwMyE7i-2FK6xq6GP1AUPBqTV-2B4fhgIKoKm3p07E-2B4tMn7fxMu3uvWdLJD70VF8C-2F2zZRVduf-2FF3iEvEEvUxR0LX-2FA-2B0-3D%2FjnT1&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cronan01px2020%40saschina.org%7C3cf424b6b1344b18c7e608d7b975a8fc%7Cd4c1f548d2494e72a7cb733b702e48d3%7C0%7C0%7C637181787338307345&amp;sdata=sYRvJ4eCCmed%2BM0HkQbgkWel9yxcArRVmYL4T9NZlfc%3D&amp;reserved=0) opportunity Chapman offers for Fowler School of Engineering admits. I've talked to various students and Dr. Linstead himself about the school and the major and it's been incredibly insightful.\n\nFeel free to DM, would be down to talk if we both are potentially attending haha.",

The program is getting bigger and better especially now that Fowler is opening next year.

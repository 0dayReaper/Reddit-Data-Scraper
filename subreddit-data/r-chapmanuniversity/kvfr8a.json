    "postText": "Struppa's hands aren't tied -- he's just hiding behind the Faculty Manual because he sympathizes with John Eastman's politics. I'm sure it doesn't help that Struppa's wife, Lisa Sparks, ran an unsuccessful congressional campaign in 2020 where she aligned herself with Trump and his policies. [**She also supported anti-mask policies as a member of the Orange County Education Board.**](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/14/891119489/orange-county-education-board-member-on-her-vote-for-schools-to-reopen-without-m)\n\nStruppa's protecting Eastman because they're all on the same team.\n\n[**As a number of faculty have already pointed out**](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-01-09/chapman-university-faculty-john-eastman), the Supreme Court (and any reasonable, compassionate human being) has long recognized that free speech is protected so long as it doesn't incite violence and/or lawlessness. And when it does, it goes by a different name: [**Sedition**](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sedition?s=t)**.**\n\nEastman's conduct over the last year has encouraged and emboldened the domestic terrorists who attacked the Capitol. [**His suggestion that Kamala Harris isn't a citizen despite being born in Oakland**](https://www.newsweek.com/some-questions-kamala-harris-about-eligibility-opinion-1524483) echoes racist, xenophobic Birtherism conspiracy theories that sought to invalidate Barack Obama's candidacy in 2008. When Eastman and Rudy Giuliani appeared before a rally in Washington D.C. on Jan. 6, [**they whipped the crowd into a frenzy with unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud and election tampering before Giuliani suggested that the best course of action was \"trial by combat.\"**](https://youtu.be/kzs-kanwdZ0?t=55)\n\nA call for violence.\n\nEmboldened members of that same crowd stormed the Capitol a short time later.\n\nIf Struppa can't recognize the connection, he's incompetent. At best. But I fear Struppa's actions are guided by ambition and cowardice. Perhaps he's spent too much time splashing around in the same political waters as John Eastman, Rudy Giuliani, and the many extremists who've hijacked the Republican Party to remember that he oversees an institution that serves a higher purpose than political expediency -- education, illumination, &amp; truth.\n\nJohn Eastman's conduct brings shame and embarrassment to Chapman. He makes a mockery of those values. If Struppa cannot muster the courage to recognize a higher calling than the Faculty Manual and the limits of his own imagination, perhaps Chapman should find someone who can.",

            "comment": "I share your sentiment on Eastman, but I disagree with the call for Struppa to be replaced. A lot of the original post is based on personal beliefs or opinions, so I am going to try and focus on only the facts presented.\n\nThere seems to be no evidence to say that Struppa *\"can't recognize the connection\"* of Eatman's actions. In fact, his previous statement seems to go against the aforementioned opinion when he states that *\"those responsible for the attack on the most sacred symbols of that democracy must be held responsible and we expect justice to be done\"*. Struppa even agrees with your statement that *\"John Eastman's conduct brings shame and embarrassment to Chapman. He makes a mockery of those values\"* when he states that *\"Eastman\u2019s actions are in direct opposition to the values and beliefs of our institution.\"*\n\nThe factual issue at play here is that until a disbarment or felony charge is pressed against the faculty member, there is no legal recourse Chapman can **currently** take. CU Boulder's statement (were Eastman is currently teaching) seemingly coincides with Chapman's: \n&gt; *\"In response to pressure from said activists, CU Chancellor Philip DiStefano said that the university would not dismiss Eastman, because doing so would violate policy tied to the first amendment. However, he did say that \u201cProfessor Eastman\u2019s conduct does not reflect the values of our university. He has embarrassed our institution. CU Boulder is committed to the free exchange of ideas and the pursuit of knowledge, and Professor Eastman has contributed nothing of value to support the ideals of either the Benson Center or CU Boulder.\u201d*\n\n\nI would encourage you to not call for a ruling by decree or a suspension of democracy. If we want to allow Struppa to act above the rules agreed to and set forth by all faculty and board members in this instance, then we accept this course of action as acceptable in all forthcoming instances. The manual would become guidelines or suggestions rather than a binding document. Rather than stooping to those potentially erroneous and dangerous depths of lawlessness and unilateral, unchecked action, the best way to secure the professor's dismissal is to call for a legal investigation or disbarring. Another course of action would be to encourage changing the rules of tenure (or the faculty manual language) with a faculty petition and/or vote to amend the document.",

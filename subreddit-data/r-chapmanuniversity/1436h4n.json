I\u2019m a transfer from community college and they sent me an email saying \u201cBased on your completed credits, you are now eligible to apply for degree conferral (also known as apply for graduation). This is how you inform the university when you plan to complete all requirements on your program evaluation so your degree can be awarded.\u201d What does this mean? I haven\u2019t even started at this school yet. I\u2019m so lost lmao. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

I didn't see anything like that on the website that I could still sign up for, but does anyone know if I can take classes at another school that will count as credit here?",

You can use [the TES lookup](https://tes.collegesource.com/publicview/TES_publicview01.aspx?rid=d1362265-7acd-4ee2-8e6b-853adc8b6b2d&amp;aid=1a01b3f5-6ebe-412d-9ea7-41e5ed981fde) to determine where you can transfer credits from and how much each class is worth! I\u2019m currently taking ASL at Santa Ana and it counts for 4 credits. Definitely recommend looking into local community colleges as they\u2019re easy to apply to",

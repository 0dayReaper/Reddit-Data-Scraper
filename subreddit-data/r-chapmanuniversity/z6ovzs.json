    "postText": "Hello. I am currently in community college and am about to finish all my general education classes. I have also taken many film production classes as well. I was wondering how hard creative producing is to transfer too. I cannot find the acceptance rate for transfers but I know the production degree is like 5-10 percent. Is the production degree the same percentage? Thank you for responding.",

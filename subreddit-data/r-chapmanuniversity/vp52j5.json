I am a transfer student from 2020, and have had some problems with stuff falling through the cracks which has delayed my timely graduation. It really sucks to hear how y\u2019all are getting screwed out of your housing grants/scholarships - they should still allot that for off-campus housing. Absolutely not cool. \n\nContact the Dean of Students office. They need to hear about all of this and your concerns. They\u2019re the only ones that have serious pull to get stuff handled.",

It really feels like transfers end up marginalized, with preference given to those who have four years of tuition to give them.",

    "postText": "Hi! Incoming Wilkinson student here! Recently, I went on a campus tour and looked at some of the dorms and one of the nice students told us that usually students of the same college like Fowles would be on the same floor/in the same wing of the building. I heard every college but Wilkinson mentioned in this list as they told us \u201cDodge would be on this floor\u201d \u201cFowles is in the east wing\u201d etc. Does anyone have an idea which hall/where first-year Wilkinson Students would be? I know it\u2019s random, but they were very sure about all the colleges placement in the dorms at the time. All but Wilkinson. Are they put anywhere specific?\n\nThanks in advance! \ud83d\ude0a",

I think Henley is where Wilkinson students go?? I was meant to go there originally I\u2019m pretty sure and I\u2019m a Wilkinson student too",

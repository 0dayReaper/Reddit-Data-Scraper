If you are not in the film school, don\u2019t expect to get into events like the Duffer Bros lecture as those sorts of tickets are reserved for dodge students. There is a lot of drinking but it is still possible to have a sober social life. The area/school are pretty expensive as well",

However, the parking is a nightmare and some of the buildings are a bit outdated.\n\nMost professors are amazing, I\u2019ve rarely had a bad experience and the maintenance staff / people working at the Sodexo restaurants are also friendly. \n\nGood luck with your college applications!",

As for classes, you need to check with your professor if you can bring pets. I\u2019ve brought my rabbit to class and my dog has come to quite a few. The outdoor campus is dog friendly, and P safe is cool with trained dogs being off leash. My pup runs on the field and swims in the fountain almost daily!\n\nEdit to add: many professors bring their dogs too. As far as housing, an animal would need to be a medical accommodation (ESA or service dog)",

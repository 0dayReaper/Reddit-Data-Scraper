    "postText": "Hello, I'm not sure if anybody could help me but basically I was wondering if you guys had any tips on appealing your financial aid award. I feel like I have a pretty good case because due to circumstances my parent doesn't work anymore and I don't work as much since schools in person now (when school was online these past 2 years, I would just work all the time). What's your experience with appealing aid or what's something you wish you knew? Thanks!",

In the email provide evidence as to why your appeal is valid.  Whether that be more financial information or more merit if you have a merit based scholarship.  Make sure to thank them and also know that the max scholarship increase is up to $8k more a year.  Emphasis on doing this as SOON as possible. DM if you need more help",

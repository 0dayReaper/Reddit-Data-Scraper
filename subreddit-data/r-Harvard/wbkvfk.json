I saw a post about Grays earlier, but can anyone touch base on laundry (I see that it\u2019s missing laundry), and maybe just some additional thoughts on Grays in general? Thanks!",

There\u2019s one true double then a single that got converted into a double and a true single. The spacing is generally fine unless ur in the single that got converted into a double in which there\u2019s just not much space. The common rooms are very large, and I would recommend moving desks to the common room if you have a smaller room just to maximize space within your room. You go to weld for laundry which is a short walk but also don\u2019t forget ur id especially if you do laundry at odd times! \nIn general, a lot of ppl use the larger common rooms for parties/gatherings.\n\nI think one downside for accessibility is that there are no elevators so living on the fourth or fifth floor is kinda rough especially for move-in and move-out",

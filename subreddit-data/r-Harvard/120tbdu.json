    "postText": "I was accepted into the SPH MPH45 program and will be moving with my family to Boston soon. I have school age kids so public school districts are supper important for us. I am looking for a three bedroom apartment in either Cambridge, Somerville, Medford, or Brookline or perhaps other areas but not Boston with a May 1 or June 1 move-in date.  It seems nearly impossible to find anything. Are there groups where students help pass on apartments to incoming students? I applied for HUH for the lottery but after attending a webinar about it yesterday it does not feel too promising of a chance to get an apartment.  We really want to sign a lease before this school year ends so that we can get our kids into a good district.  \n\nAny ideas or recommendations would be great. Thank you!",

There are Harvard Specific ones but I would for sure check out the Somerville, Cambridge, Boston, Medford, and Arlington. \n\nIf your really in a pinch you can also use a leasing/rental agent to help you find a spot, but they come at a cost.",

I signed a June lease a month and a half ago. \n\nApartments also go incredibly quickly. The place I signed for had the advert go up the same day I applied (at least 4 people applied that afternoon). Most ads you message will already be rented out. \n\nNot sure I can offer help other than to say it's rough out here.",

Would you do it again over proctoring or finding your own summer housing in cambridge? Thanks in advance.",

            "comment": "I cannot recommend this program enough. I made some of my closest friends in college through PRISe. It is really good for networking across the undergraduate research community which helps with comping any scientific oriented club the following term. \n\nHousing is fine, they used to put you in Leverett tower, so n+1 suites, not sure if that has changed. The mandatory programming is pretty light and to be honest you want to go to them so it doesn\u2019t feel mandatory.",

            "comment": "I did another program in the research village, and I really enjoyed it! All of PRISE, SPUDS, SURGH, SHARP, BLISS stay in Winthrop over the summer, and you can generally get a single if you request it. Mandatory programming wasn\u2019t annoying and there was a ton of opportunity to get funding to do whatever you wanted to do in Boston. I got like $200+ for the activity I planned and others could get around $500 for a more involved activity. Would definitely do it over proctoring bc you stay for longer and Winthrop is generally nice to live in and live with peers. If you want to live more independently and have to cook and everything then you should find your own summer housing. The main downside is the stipend isn\u2019t much  and you have to figure out your own lunch plans unless ur in PRIMO.",

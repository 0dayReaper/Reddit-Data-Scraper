And SFP/OWA are not super convenient to the rest of Boston, and technically you\u2019re only supposed to sublet to Harvard affiliates, so it\u2019s tough. Dorms are a 9mo lease, so no summer liability. \n\nI loved being able to host people in my apartment and cook meals in my own kitchen, and also loved living in the same building as many of my friends. Would definitely pick OWA again.",

Do you have any opinions on which are the best dorm halls? And does the hbs experience differ depending on which hall you're in?",

Although, it has by far the best community in my option versus the other dorms. Gallatin is hands down the best one. I think people like Hamilton and/or Chase as well. McCullough is the only one with shared bathroom which was a hard no for me.",

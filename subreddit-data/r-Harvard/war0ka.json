            "comment": "i lived there and i am now a ride or die for canaday. you have a good chance of getting a single but from what I remember the double is the same size as a single so it\u2019s pretty cramped. you get used to the stairs and the common room is large with super nice windows and you will have the best view of annenberg. two locked doors to get to your room can be problematic so try not to forget your keys. If you get the double you can always agree to switch after winter break. I think the people in canaday really learn to love it (or at least i did) and there is a lot of people who live there which is good for making friends. you can PM if u have any other specific questions",

If you go to office hours, be proactive, and keep turning everything in even if you feel lost, the other comments probably apply\u2014but I got mid Bs on both midterms and got that final grade so take it as you will",

I'm not sure if you're premed (then you probably shouldn't be taking something as rigorous as 22a) or something, but if you're doing decently well in your classes (doing your problem sets adequately, doing average on the midterms) then your GPA will probably average around a 3.7, which is fine.",

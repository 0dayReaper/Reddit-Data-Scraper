Could be wrong though.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge most of what you\u2019re talking about is in trial advocacy courses or is one of the organized moot courts. As far as I know, no courses are open for viewing and moot court attendance is limited to other law students.\n\nYou can view recordings of the Ames moot court final rounds online though. Not sure if they live-stream when they\u2019re happening.",

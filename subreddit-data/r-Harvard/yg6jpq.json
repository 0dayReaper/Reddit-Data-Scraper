    "postText": "Hey y'all I'm not trying troll but I just wanted to fact check something. I think I need a current student. I was listening to a podcast and it stated that the current head of Harvard's Campus police used to be part of a pretty notorious deputy gang called the Grim Reapers while he was working for the sheriff's department in L.A. Like I said not trying troll I just wanted to know what the current students knew about this. It's a pretty serious accusation since you had to kill a civilian to join.",

You could invite him to the beach \ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f jk though. Also I meant if someone wrote an open letter in a public way he might have to respond. He doesn't really have responsibility to a random journalist but he does technically have some level of responsibility and a level of respectability that he needs to maintain in the community of which he works.",

We also found other info on the internet where it also mentions he was a member of the deputy gang Grim Reapers who were involved in civil rights violations and the shooting of black males back in the 90s and covered up. Chief Clay needs to be reported to your State's Attorney General for investigation. He also needs to show his legs for the Grim Reaper tattoo or evidence that it was removed. Per LASD Chief of Staff Larry Delmese who retired and testified under oath, himself was a Grim Reaper and he had a tattoo but had it removed because his past gang affiliation had served no more purpose with his present and future. The problem for Chief Delmese is that with new Calif laws passed in Jan 2022 being associated with or in a deputy gang will forfeit any current or future employment in law enforcement. Hope he enjoys his retirement but is not guilt-free. What he was involved with left behind a lot of unchecked victims.

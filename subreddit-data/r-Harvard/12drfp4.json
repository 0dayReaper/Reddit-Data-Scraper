But I\u2019m curious, if I\u2019m crazy enough to all of a sudden double down on my hard work, to achieve more so that I apply to Harvard GSAS with a outstanding profile, does grad school offer the same opportunities as offered from undergrad school such as financial aid, programs for new students, social events? Is there anything that\u2019s only reserved for undergrads that aren\u2019t available for grads? Does grad school feel the same or is it crappier and people are like \u201cjust get your master\u2019s and leave\u201d?",

You'll never have an experience like being an undergrad again, so make the most of that time no matter where you are. If you want to go to grad school at Harvard, do it because there's a program here you're excited about, not because you want to experience campus life.",

I can tell you at my school, social life is complete garbage because people hang with those that already know each other from school or not at all; they just come for class and leave. I don\u2019t know if life is the same at Harvard college since it\u2019s smaller and everyone does the liberal arts degree",

Then you get sorted into your upper class houses and have all those unique bonding experiences and interhouse rivalries and house specific traditions. Maybe get into final clubs. \n\nAll that is off the table for grad students. That doesn't mean grad school is a bad experience. It's just a situation where different things form different kinds of bonds in a more adult and more professional setting. \n\nUndergrad is about frantically dog paddling to keep your head above water, being stretched in all the different liberal arts directions to mold you from a lump of dough to a well rounded pizza. Grad school is a transition to being a serious scholar as a grown adult. It's about honing the skills that by now you've figured out were your strengths and interests and achieving a small measure of mastery.\n\nThe secret is nobody lives a long enough lifetime to achieve true mastery over anything. There is always something new to learn, and when you get to a high enough level of knowledge, you paradoxically realize you are a perpetual freshman.\n\nYou're focusing too hard on what you don't have. Comparison is the thief of joy. Maybe Harvard College is off the table...but if you're miserable where you're at, there are other places you can transfer to. Find incoming juniors from community college and bond with them at a new uni. And if you really want a Harvard experience of some sort later, it's possible. The world is your oyster. Billions of people would trade places with you right now.",

You\u2019ll find people have similar priorities along with work obligations associated with getting the degree. You move away from the \u2018just liberal arts\u2019 mentality to something more specialized. In my experience, it\u2019s where I found similar personalities I really clicked with because we had similar goals. It was something I really was hoping to find given I was a student athlete in undergrad and didn\u2019t have my team friends anymore. Nor was there really a similar space in my grad program to a sports team. I definitely had to start over. Plus, Harvard really is a huge melting pot with people from all over. I found everyone\u2019s backgrounds so interesting because they\u2019d had such different life experiences. I was learning more from the people than the curriculum was giving in my first year. But ultimately, it\u2019s NOTHING like the college. I promise. It\u2019s the best!",

    "postText": "Pre-frosh here. I'm interested in the CPB and CMB concentrations. I'm interested in LS50 because it seems like a pretty comprehensive STEM course and a springboard for biochem research. Chemistry, physics, and biology are all subjects I want to explore at Harvard. That being said, I haven't had access to a lot of science courses in my high school. I'm strong in IB Bio and decent in Math AA (if I had to guess probably AP Bio and Calc AB levels), but I'm weak in chem and physics. Minimal experience with Python as well.\n\nI'm very motivated to study all of these subjects, but with my current background, would I be biting more than I can chew with LS50 in my first year? It kinda feels like it but the course description seems very exciting. Even if I have to dedicate 30hr/w to that course it seems like it's worth it. That being said, I don't want to jump straight into the deep end in my first semester.",

            "comment": "I jumped straight into the deep end when I took LS50 in 2019-2020!  I had no advanced chemistry or biology, only AP physics C (not helpful for the class really) and AP calc BC (quite helpful).  Did not know any coding at all either.  It was difficult and the 30 hrs per week is no joke, but I would say it was worth it for me.  The professors, TFs, and CAs are great and supportive, and there are plenty of office hours (you will need them).  I was able to find a lab through one of the TFs that I ended up doing my thesis in, which was cool too.  The best thing about LS 50 were my classmates though!  Everyone was incredibly kind, helpful, and we became super close (turns out spending ~ 30 hours a week with people while working through problems means you become friends).  However, it is a big time commitment, and freshman year should be about exploring everything you can and finding what you like.  If you aren\u2019t able to manage your time well, LS 50 might end up being an albatross around your neck when you need to finish the Pset but your friends want to go do something.  Feel free to DM if you want to talk more about it",

            "comment": "May I ask if you have a high IQ? Your interest in these different fields is probably symptomatic of someone with a high IQ. Regardless, it is important to try and figure out how this fits into your goals. If you have a fair degree of clarity about your goals, then it might be helpful for you to see if this fits in there. If you have very little clarity about your goals, then you should work to acquire greater clarity on that aspect of your future. Think about it like this - you could consider taking separate courses on these different subjects and then watching courses like this one -- for virtually free on UDacity, Udemy, Coursera or what not - later on. Try and focus on strengthening on the areas you are weak on - with a view towards getting to where your academic goals are. \n\nSay, you want to become a doctor. Then, **focus on those subjects where you will be able to build up on your weaknesses (in those specific areas) where it will likely make a difference in terms of you actually becoming a doctor.**",

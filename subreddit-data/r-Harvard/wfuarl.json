Planning on doing CS51 year two. my major is currently neuroscience with the computation subtrack but I\u2019m exploring things and don\u2019t have that much thought out.",

If you're just interested in knowing the basics and learning how to code in Python, then take CS32. \n\nThat said, I think CS50 will prepare you a lot more for CS51.",

CS50 teaches you how to code; CS51 teaches you how to code well. Trust me, you won\u2019t know much about programming or CS after taking CS 32. CS50 teaches a lot of material; it just teaches it fast. When you take more CS courses and do more practice or even TF for CS50, all the material will make a lot of sense.",

I didn\u2019t know that Cs32 didnt teach as much as it seemed pretty equivalent in terms of syllabus but it did seem like a generally lighter class. I keep hearing that Cs50 is a ton over work and have been a bit intimidated by all of that, but I really want to know how to code and understand cs principals so i value your insights in saying CS50 would be better. I have a pretty heavy course load planned so hopefully it wont be too bad.",

CS32 might be tempting but it\u2019s an extremely new course taught in Python.\n\nPython in general is a language that abstracts away a lot of computer science concepts like memory management, pointers, etc. \n\nEven though CS50 might seem difficult at first because it\u2019s initially thought in C, it will help you prepare for classes like 51 and 61 if you want to take them.\n\nPeople choose 32 because it\u2019s in Python and generally easier. However if you\u2019re serious about CS (not just programming) learning just Python is not the way to go when CS51 is taught in OCaml and CS61 in C++ which are generally considered to be a low-level.\n\nAnyways, if you\u2019re confused in 50, you can always come to my OH.",

CS50 sounds like tedious work at times, with a lot of homework and the fact it starts with scratch\u2026 I feel like it\u2019s such a large class. I just want whichever class is best for learning programming solidly. I will take CS51 at some point, so was deciding between CS50 and CS32. This is good to know.",

    "postText": "Hey rockstars, I'm an Aussie international coming over for a Summer School course. I'd like to bring my Harvard jumper over as a pyjama top, especially since it will be perfectly warm for the colder climates I'm holidaying too afterwards. Is this something that would be laughable? Not certain what the social norms are for wearing a uni's own merchandise on the uni campus, whether it's seen as 'cringe' or whatever.",

Wear what represents who you are.\n\nI will say, however, that I noticed more people wearing Harvard gear during summer school compared to the regular semesters. Another notable distinction was that people tended to wear more \u201cclub\u201d or \u201cathletic\u201d affiliated Harvard gear during the regular school year than during summer school. But this observation is not meant to be discouraging, just an observation.\n\nIf you are on campus, there is no A/C, so you\u2019ll probably find yourself stripping down rather than wearing a sweatshirt. I remember that being my biggest issue when I was on campus during the summer. Oh, and the dining hall hours and locations are limited. Good luck!",

Rock your sweater! Also, it's murderously hot here in the summer, so you might wanna invest in a summer version.",

    "postText": "Howdy, I'm an incoming G1 from Colorado who really loves fitness and the outdoors. I'm looking forward to my move to Cambridge but I am really confused about the Harvard recreation facilities... Can anyone help me understand what the heck is going on?! There's multiple gyms? Will I have access to all of them or are some just for sports teams? Are they all well equipped for lifting and workouts? Can you use facilities like pools, basketball and tennis courts? Is there any pickup basketball? Yoga? Most importantly, what gym(s) do you guys recommend for lifting? The recreation website is impossible to understand, please forgive me.\n\nI'm also a trail runner. While I won't have the mountains like I'm used to, I hear Boston is a great running city. Any routes or trails near campus y'all enjoy?\nThanks!",

MAC is the biggest and has a pool, and there are classes for other activities you can sign up for like yoga. I've tried the three big ones for undergrads (Mac, QRAC, and Hemmenway). I personally liked the latter two the best because the MAC is just so  Although tbh the ratio of lifting equipment to students is ridiculous and the machines can be hard to get to quickly especially during the school year or during busy times.",

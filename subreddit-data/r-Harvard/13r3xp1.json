Black gold, Texas tea. \n\nSeriously, after you save enough to have an emergency fund, Put all you money in a low cost S&amp;P 500 index fund like you can get from Vanguard, Schwab or Fidelity. They\u2019re all the same. Buy into it every month whether the market is up or down, and let the magic of compound returns work in your favor. There are few managed funds that beat the S&amp;P 500 over time. Warren Buffett advises that regular investors can\u2019t do better. If you don\u2019t think you\u2019re smarter than Warren Buffett, I suggest you follow his advice. I follow Warren\u2019s advice myself. Do a little Googling yourself and you\u2019ll see that the sure money long-term is an index fund in the broader market. Sure, there are people who start a money management firm in their dorm at Harvard and found some of the great venture capital firms of the world. But those people literally are smarter than Warren Buffett and can beat him at his game. That\u2019s not someone you should compare yourself to. \n\nVery soon you will be a well regarded lawyer making a substantial income. You will very quickly become a high net worth individual. And if your only investment strategy is to live below your means and to contribute to an S&amp;P 500 index fund every month, you will outperform 90% of all the fancy managed fund people who will soon be begging for your business.",

Typically conservative estimates for index funds (ex: VTSAX etc) are 7-8% **REAL** (meaning accounting for inflation) each year or about 10% nominal. Of course those are averages and not guaranteed. \n\nThere's a lot of in-depth debates about what % loans you should pay off and in general 6% or above is considered high and should be prioritised before any sort of investments. Anything 3% and under in this economy (when considering inflation) is basically \"free money\" and should be paid minimally, of course there are nuances.",

                            "comment": "Sure. The big factor in your personal calculus is your expected income. If you\u2019re going into public interest or something on the lower end of expected income you\u2019ll need to be much more conservative and pay down your debt at the rate of maybe two to one versus investing. You still want to invest even as you pay down your debt but you need to get rid of the increasing expense of interest as fast as possible and you\u2019ll need to curtail your lifestyle to do it. The compound effect of interest is working against you need to free yourself of that burden so you can start making compound returns work for you. \n\nNow here is where your personal situation might differ from most people and you may get well-meaning advice that doesn\u2019t match your situation. Everyone is going to tell you that as a young student/new grad you need to scrimp and save and live as though you\u2019re in poverty until all your loans are paid and you have a huge balance in your investment account. That\u2019s good advice for most people, but if you\u2019re planning to go into a firm right away, you may start with a high enough of a salary that you shouldn\u2019t subject yourself to so much personal sacrifice in the beginning. You didn\u2019t go through the trouble of qualifying for a high salary just to live off of max and cheese for the next ten years. You still want to live below your means, but you want to live comfortably below your means.  \n\nMy larger point is that if you are going into a firm, you should start thinking of yourself as a high net worth individual and handle yourself accordingly. It\u2019s a weird feeling if you\u2019re not from a wealthy background to go from starving student to high income overnight. It takes a little while to get used to it. The important part is that While you\u2019re working through that process you start investing immediately as high net worth individuals do so that you get the advantage of extra time in the market. That was the number one mistake my wife and I made as we started our careers. We lived cheaply but we hoarded our savings far too long before getting them into the market. And when we did we didn\u2019t invest efficiently. I wish we had followed my own advice ten years earlier. \n\nAs the poster above pointed out, paying back your loans depends on the interest rate. Calculate the cost of retiring your debt and reducing your interest payments in terms of a return on investment and balance that between your repayment plan and investments. You\u2019re still going to want to prioritize paying down debt, but with a high income you are able to tolerate more debt without threatening your long term financial success.",

Building a good credit score is pretty essential to having financial freedom so watch a couple youtube videos on the subject (I can give you some if you need) and start working on that. Credit cards also offer a lot of benefits like cashback or travel miles that you cant get through other payment methods. Just be sure to spend within your means and on time or the interest will fuck you.",

Marry someone likeminded (a saver marrying a spender is a recipe for homicide). Pay off your debts asap. Interest owed compounds over time, in a magically horrible way. Once debts are paid you\u2019ve got positive net worth, congratulations! Try to settle into a low cost of living area (nice house for your family around $500-700k) when possible. Buy your primary residence with cash (That homestead is usually protected from creditors). That way each month a good chunk of your earnings will now be flowing into your VTI VOO VTSAX index funds and compounding will be doing its magical thing to make you a multimillionaire. Once a multimillionaire, shift into a better balanced work situation and invest your freed-up time in your family, your community, and other things that give you joy. Now buy umbrella insurance and keep the liability coverage of your auto policies high.",

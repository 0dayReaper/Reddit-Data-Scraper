Obviously these are a minority of graduates but they are also some of the most successful and/or high profile ones right now. When looking at schools culture it makes people think that Harvard's culture maybe isn't for them if it's producing high profile grifters and Birch Society weirdos (the founder being a Harvard dropout BTW).",

The 11th Circuit being a conservative leaning court at that, DeSantis couldn't find one friend on that court that could even make some fake dissent to try to justify it. In fact the person who wrote the opinion was none other than Judge Kevin Newsom, a Trump appointee. I'm going to say a bunch of other things coming down the line are going to be ruled unconstitutional. The \"Stop Woke Act\" is dead in the water, he's already in trouble for firing an elected prosecutor, and he's going to eat shit I terms of constitutionality on his crusade against Disney without a doubt. Maybe we aren't reading the same Constitution.",

That doesn't project a loyalty to truth above all else, they aren't better politicians, Judges, or lawyers than anyone else, their slinging mud and politicizing themselves for the grift in such a lowbrow way it's completely independent of their politics. Other conservatives look at the Kari Lakes lawsuits as an absolute joke, but you have a Harvard professor signing his name to those same arguments? Don't conservatives not like Jeffery Epstein? Who was it that was defending Epstein? \n\nA goal of conservative jurists was to bring legitimacy back to the Supreme Court, but now John Roberts (Harvard grad) is in charge with a supermajority of conservative justices and the confidence in the court is at an all time low. That all time low includes conservatives who have lost confidence in the court, another objectively neutral opinion. \n\nDeSantis is in the news right now for passing blatantly unconstitutional laws. Don't take my word for it, take the 11th Circuits and Circuit and author of the majority opinion Judge Kevin Newsoms (a Trump appointee and conservative) word for it. \n\nThese people happen to be conservative but their actions, objectively are a clown show and not becoming of a Harvard graduate, or are they?",

                            "comment": "My two cents: In the 90s, I was conservative, voted for Republicans and had no qualms about it. The party got so blatantly un-American and downright fascist, I cannot and will not vote for any republican. They seem to have abandoned any semblance of justice, law and order, decorum, or due diligence. \n\nBy coincidence, I was studying constitutional law in Harvard when the brief about Roe v Wade leaked. My professor had been a Supreme Court clerk in his youth and was asked how could the leak happen? He said it was obviously intentional. Why? Because justices will sometimes write an internal draft of their vote and then change their mind and their vote. But if a draft leaks what the decision was and the final decision ends up changing, the public will usually be able to figure out which justice flipped, creating a lot of potential political blowback for that justice. He speculated a justice may have been on the fence, and the leak was intended to pressure them into not flipping. \nHe said (and this is my point) such a leak would be unthinkable in a previous generation. In his day, they were told that what deliberations happen within the walls stayed there. And everybody honored that as sacred. Apparently not so under this court. \n\nThere really does seem to be a breakdown of reverence, ethics and civics in the modern era, but I don't necessarily believe that it's unique to HLS, nor that HLS is disproportionately affected by it. I think it's just part of a larger phenomenon of societal shift. \n\nYes, one would think that clown show behavior would be unbecoming of a Law grad. Because of how ostensibly competitive it is to get in...to gain admission and then complete the juris doctor, it is a reasonable assumption that anyone who does so must really have their stuff together and be pretty buttoned down. You'd think clowns couldn't cut it there. And yet...  \ud83e\udd21",

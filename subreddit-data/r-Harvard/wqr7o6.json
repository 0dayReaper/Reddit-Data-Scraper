Although the preqs for 25A say Calc BC + some proof experience, except it to be a lot of work (more than the average student who will have math experience significantly beyond BC Calc). Also, keep in mind that all these classes (Math, Phys, and CS50 at least) are a huge step up from the AP courses. AP courses aren't on the level of intro college courses at all.",

If your math experience is Calc BC, you should plan for 25A to take you much more time than the average student in the class. If you feel as if you can handle it, but it's a lot of work (which it will be), I would suggest dropping Physics 15A.",

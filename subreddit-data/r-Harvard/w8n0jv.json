Also, you don\u2019t have to decide concentration for over a year, so LS50 is a good branching point for any life sciences concentration really and would allow you to explore a lot. \n\nLS50 and 21a will be really math heavy, so adding CS50 will be a really math heavy fall. Talking to an advisor about timeline would be best, but I think LS50, CS50 and 21a/freshman seminar is great. You could take the freshman seminar in the fall and 21a in the spring to lighten the fall load a bit with 2 of the toughest classes you could possibly take. That might depend on which semester has the seminars you\u2019re most interested in.",

That being said, you can probably do LS50 alongside CS50 (I had a friend who did so) but honestly I\u2019d say to go with AM10 instead. It\u2019s much more useful and focuses on one language (Python) rather than everything CS50 teaches. I took CS50 and it was a lot, and I had coding experience with Java from AP CSA. You also would need to know Python for LS50, so it would go hand in hand hopefully. As for math, trying it first semester might be okay, but I know LS50 is quite math heavy, so I\u2019d say ask one of the course instructors about what math to take complementary to LS50",

    "postText": "Hum10 genuinely fascinates me. After scouring the Q-Guide, it seems that most students walk away from the course with a sense of fondness and enlightenment. Although it\u2019s challenging, it\u2019s extraordinarily rewarding.\n\nI\u2019m considering a concentration in neuroscience, so I\u2019m trying to be careful in my course selection so that I can hit pre-reqs and also have time for a social life. Thus\u2026.I am conflicted. But that\u2019s the liberal arts experience - exploring both the humanities and natural sciences. Investigating their crossroads. \n\nCan anyone give me insight regarding hum10? Their experience? Their afterthoughts (especially if they\u2019re concentrating in STEM)?\n\nSide note - I am also looking into a joint or secondary in a humanities/social studies field and am quite interested in law.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I'm a Philosophy &amp; STEM double major. I came to Harvard as a pure STEM student, wanted to take Hum 10 but got placed into Expos 20 instead. I ended up having a great time in my Expos 20 and, thinking back, part of me is actually glad I didn't get into Hum 10. Not because I didn't hear people having great time there but because not taking it enabled me to focus on the areas of humanities that I am specifically interested in (for me, that is philosophy).\n\nI think Hum 10 could be awesome if you are interested in humanities more broadly. However, I think one could come off equally enlightened from a more narrowly focused humanities class in one of the departments *if that narrow topic is of a particular interest to you.* That is also an option if you have an otherwise intense pset-heavy schedule.\n\nHowever, I'd recommend reaching out to the teaching staff and inquire about the issue!",

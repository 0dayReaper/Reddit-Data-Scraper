    "postText": "Hello,\n\nMy name is Jason Davis '26, and I am a student at Dartmouth College who founded a billiards club at Dartmouth. We are looking to see if there is still a billiards club at this university, because we are trying to plan a tournament with other colleges from the Northeast. If you are interested or know anyone that would be interested, please let me know. Thanks again, and have a good day!\n\nEmail: jason.a.davis.25@dartmouth.edu",

Finding students who used to actually take the game seriously was pretty rare.  Students who owned their own cues was maybe a handful from year to year that I would meet.",

Then you\u2019re pretty much just moving in and then doing whatever afterwards, I believe you\u2019ll usually have an intro floor meeting that night or something. I personally liked moving in super early bc then I could leave and hangout with my parents or just chill.",

Other than that, though, there really isn't a \"schedule\" I remember other than having dinner with your family in Annenberg, so you can relax, explore Harvard, and buy any supplies you need!",

Huero is the closest working towards building things, but still not quite right.\n\nAlso, just lookup the MIT club -- there's a lot more overlap than you might guess and if they're working with one of the groups they'll tell you. Otherwise, it's not unheard of to join a club if it's not offered like dance, etc.",

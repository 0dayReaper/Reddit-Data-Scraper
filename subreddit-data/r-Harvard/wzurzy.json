I'm thinking of applying for the visiting undergrad student program for my junior year and wanted to hear what current students have to share. \n\n\\- Do people generally transition into the school easily? is there an orientation program for vus specifically or do they participate in the first year orientation\n\n\\- How do people even find housing in the area?? visiting undergrads can't live in dorms so I have to find a place on my own but I don't even know where I would start. Also it says vus admission results will come out by June 1st which gives me maybe 2-3 months to find a house.. which doesn't seem like enough time tbh. \n\n\\- is there an international student community? At my current school the intl community has been a great place of comfort and social interaction for me so i wonder if i'd be able to find a similar experience at harvard. \n\n\\- or if there's anything about harvard undergrad in terms of academics (especially english/physics) or life in general that 'outsiders' wouldn't necessarily know about please do share! \n\nThank you all",

            "comment": "From what I know the program you\u2019re referring to is small and largely international thus you should not rely on Harvard folks at large on Reddit for advice as the chance you get someone appropriate (a current VUS ) who also is knowledgeable is pretty slim. Just reach out to the Admissions contact. \n\nBe wary of advice at large\u2014Harvard has a ton of \u201cspecial visiting programs\u201d and so you might get advice from other \u201cvisiting students\u201d who are in fact \u201cspecial student at GSAS\u201d etc. and therefore giving you wrong advice with best of intentions. Someone earlier in the summer referred to themselves as a visiting student but they were not a VUS they were in some other category. \n\nSeriously, reach out to Admissions for the program with some of these questions\u2014 I\u2019m sure they can get you actual answers. \n\nThe housing question? That\u2019s a bigger one. The admissions deadline would give time for folks to find housing but it ain\u2019t easy and it ain\u2019t cheap in Boston at the moment, but don\u2019t let that dissuade you!",

            "comment": "For housing, 2-3 months is plenty of time. In fact, having more time might not help, as advertisements for available housing are rarely posted further in advance. Real estate moves quickly in proximity to the university, but there is a lot of it (it is also quite expensive; Somerville is more affordable, but further from campus).\n\nA good resource is [harvardoffcampushousing.com](https://harvardoffcampushousing.com), where Harvard affiliates that live in off-campus buildings look for roommates or subletters. If you check \"HUH Sublets\" or \"HUH Apartment Share\" under the search options, you'll find Harvard-owned buildings, which can be nice if you want to be surrounded by other students (mostly grad students). There are always so many people needing housing arrangements that, even though it seems intimidating from the outside, you'll find something, and may even be able to avoid third-party landlords.\n\nFor the other questions, I'd suggest reaching out to the Admissions contact for your program, as has been suggested. You can also ask them if they have any former/current students in the program you can reach out to, if you want more specific social advice.",

            "comment": "Hi, this is a bit late - but as an academic adviser for visiting undergrads (VUS) I will do my best to answer these questions.\n\n- Do people generally transition into the school easily? is there an orientation program for vus specifically or do they participate in the first year orientation\n\nYes, there is an orientation specifically VUS students held at the start of the semester. At least this semester, the transition was smooth for a lot of students socially as the collective group of VUS students provided a ready-made community. Many of my students were also comfortable getting involved with the wider Harvard community, meeting students through classes and clubs, and checking out the dining halls in different houses.\n\nAdvisers like me also help out with onboarding - academically one of the challenging transitions for a lot of students coming from abroad is getting used to the elective system, and we help them to navigate that.\n\n- How do people even find housing in the area?? visiting undergrads can't live in dorms so I have to find a place on my own but I don't even know where I would start. Also it says vus admission results will come out by June 1st which gives me maybe 2-3 months to find a house.. which doesn't seem like enough time tbh.\n\nHousing can tough, especially because lease terms are inflexible and often don't meet student timelines (e.g. my lease runs September to September). However, the housing market is pretty fluid since students are constantly coming and going, with people only here for a semester etc. You can therefore find a sublet, often at short notice with people leaving these decisions to the last minute. Not sure how effective the VUS community is in passing down accommodation from semester to semester as students come and go, but could be one way to find housing. Also want to mention that although Cambridge isn't cheap, the private market can often be cheaper than Harvard housing so I'd recommend you to go in that direction.\n\n- is there an international student community? At my current school the intl community has been a great place of comfort and social interaction for me so i wonder if i'd be able to find a similar experience at harvard.\n\nYes, the VUS community is broadly international, with around a third of students coming from one university in Switzerland (which attracts students from around Europe) with other students coming from China, Germany and South America, in addition to intl students from other US colleges. Plus you can get involved in international communities at the college.\n\n- or if there's anything about harvard undergrad in terms of academics (especially english/physics) or life in general that 'outsiders' wouldn't necessarily know about please do share!\n\nNot super informed on this so will leave to others. One other thing to mention is that VUS are not assigned to a house, but to the Dudley Community and are therefore their own self contained community. However, I believe they have access to other house facilities.",

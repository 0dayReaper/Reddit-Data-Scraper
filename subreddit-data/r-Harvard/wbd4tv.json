            "comment": "Two sleeping arrangements that make sense to me:\n\n1. One single, one double and a common room. To make it somewhat fair, consider switching up rooms at the semester. That way at least two people get a single for part of the year. Switch on your own trimester schedule if you don\u2019t mind moving a bit. If you don\u2019t care about that, draw straws or whatever and someone gets a single all year and two of you share a room. I\u2019d suggest putting the double\u2019s desks in the common room. \n\n2. Make the common room into a bedroom. Everyone gets a single, but you sacrifice a common space. Everyone\u2019s desk goes in their sleeping quarters. The person with the common room gets a big space to sleep and live, but he/she sacrificed privacy and has a walk-through, so make sure your roommates are considerate enough to be quiet at late hours coming back after late classes, after working on psets, after parties, or just getting up to use the bathroom at night and in the morning.",

Very spacious rooms, hallway bathrooms are mehh (dont forget your key when using the bathroom) but they are cleaned every day, the stairs are brutal (and first floor rooms get tons of peeping tourists). It also doesn\u2019t have its own laundry room, so you\u2019ll have to go outside to do laundry, even in the middle of a snow storm\u2026 it also has gorgeous brick walls!",

I was on 5th floor and the single was literally the tiniest thing in the world \u2014 couldn\u2019t even fully open the door with the bed blocking it \ud83d\ude02 \n\nSo we decided that the tiny size of the single was enough to warrant that whoever was in the single would stay in the single the whole year. I think other rooms had different sizes though so this might not be your case.\n\nOne of my roommates left mid-year so we did debunk and move one of the beds to the big common room to use as a couch/extra bed for those who stay over. So I imagine you could do something similar. \n\nMatthews is great. 5th floor was a LEG WORKOUT every day. Whenever I left, I left all day. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t leave at all \ud83d\ude02 it is a little far from Annenberg but I didn\u2019t mind it. Close to the Square.\n\nKeep in mind it is one of the most photographed dorms on campus (looks very Harvard), so you might have some tourists taking pics whenever you leave. 1st floor usually keeps their windows closed because of this as well.",

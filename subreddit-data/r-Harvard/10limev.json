I can imagine dev salaries decreasing eventually but I can't imagine a huge job shortage in a universally applicable field and technologically growing world.",

However, it will replace outsourced juniors before it replaces well taught engineers that can move up to cloud infrastructure and beyond.\n\nThe key is there are no safe jobs, technology can achieve anything.  Knowing how the technology works though is the safest job there is.",

Remember, the market doesn\u2019t care about you. If you go into CS largely because of an assumption it will pay a certain amount and then 10 years from now there\u2019s a huge shift and it does not, you don\u2019t want to be upset with yourself or working in a job field you really don\u2019t like. \n\nThat said per commenter above, these layoffs need to be viewed IN CONTEXT: they aren\u2019t yet laying off to pre pandemic levels\u2026.",

            "comment": "I think that CS will shift more to working on and with Machine Learning similar to how new coding advancements made it so you don\u2019t need to code in binary machine language. If you were from a less rigorous or respected program or university it might be a concern but there will always always be a demand for technical engineers in CS especially especially from Harvard and similarly well known schools. \n\nThe tech layoffs are more to do with the fact that there is a ongoing global recession than a future indicator of the CS profession becoming obsolete. Many of these companies overhired during Covid and now that the economic consequences of a global economic shut down and money printing is kicking in all businesses and professions will experience layoffs. \n\nBut looking medium to long term having a CS degree will even assist you in getting management positions, technical management, product management, etc. So the CS degree is more versatile than people sometimes think. Also there is always a competition for talented engineers it\u2019s usually the lower tier that gets cut and or replaced by automation. Companies would be more than willing to invest in a Harvard grad to train. \n\nI\u2019m getting a little rambling but if you are passionate about CS don\u2019t worry about AI or layoffs and just keep pursuing it.",

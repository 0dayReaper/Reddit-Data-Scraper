I would definitely recommend starting small and buying more when needed; there are plenty of options near Harvard (Target in Central, Dollar Tree &amp; Dollar General along Somerville/Cambridge border).\n\nThat said, college is a great time to start take digitized notes. At this stage in your education, you will be accumulating more and more relevant information that you might refer back to *and* you will have fewer stable physical storage options. \n\nAn iPad or other device with a pen is an excellent choice, or a Rocketbook gives you (close to) the typical pen-and-paper experience with better quality scanning and organization than merely taking a picture of your notebook.",

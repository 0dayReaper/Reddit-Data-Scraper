    "postText": "hey guys!! first year planning to book a round trip for winter break\u2014do you guys recommend coming for winter session or is it not worth missing out on a week of break? on paper, it sounds amazing; a way to pick up new hobbies and take a break from academics in a chill environment. but i\u2019m not sure if the reality is that picturesque\u2014if anything, i suppose i could just wander around boston for a week if there\u2019s nothing good? for winter session, is it okay if you come a few days early/late? will harvard house you? i\u2019m confused and conflicted. \n\nalso, i don\u2019t think i\u2019ll be going home for thanksgiving since it\u2019s such a short break\u2014any recommendations for things to do while here? \n\nthanks!!",

            "comment": "unfortunately winter session usually sounds better than it actually is, and at least for the past few years (probably partially due to covid), programming has been limited at best. honestly the coolest stuff happening is usually put together by student orgs (like ski trips or international travel, etc). also cambridge in january is pretty damn bleak so I would recommend not trying to come back before you need to haha",

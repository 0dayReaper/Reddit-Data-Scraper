            "comment": "ES50 is a great course to get basic knowledge in a lot of the different aspects of electrical engineering and it emphasizes labs and a final project in which you can choose what to do. You can try to build a drone as a final project as you are encouraged to work on a project that would require research into engineering techniques that you haven't yet learned from the course. This would be a good class because you can learn both digital and analog electronics keep in mind, however, that EE is a broad and complex field so this course will teach you the basics but will not go into great detail about specific topics. you would have to take more advanced classes for that which have steeper prereqs and are very niche for example ES 153 only covers analog electronics\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. Es 50 also has very few prereqs",

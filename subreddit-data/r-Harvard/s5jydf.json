His year was wild, as it was the class year of Bill Gates. We later found out my high school physics teacher was in his class and looked him up in the yearbook.\n\nEdit: OP you reminded me with the Tom Morello tidbit that my father\u2019s sister dropped out of Harvard and joined a punk rock band.",

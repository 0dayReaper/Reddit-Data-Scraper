    "postText": "I'm interested in the Government (following the Data Science path) and CS concentrations (Gov bc of passion/intended concentration coming into college, CS bc I partially took CS50 over this summer and found it interesting/good field financially). I'm unsure if I want to joint concentrate the two together, do a double concentration (those just started being allowed, right?) or choose one as a primary and another as a secondary (unsure which will be which in this case). My biggest concern is course load, especially if I were to pursue a double concentration where I'd have to fulfill the full requirements for both.\n\nThis fall, I plan on taking GOV50, CS50 (got stuck around week 5 and didn't finish this summer), Portuguese 30 (lang requirement), and a seminar class.\n\nIs this a valid schedule to start off with? Should I substitute the seminar for another Gov or CS course?",

            "comment": "Since it seems like you\u2019re pretty set on some sort of Gov/CS combo, I would drop the seminar in favor of some other requirement-filling class instead, to give some more flexibility with deciding on joint/double/primary secondary. I\u2019m also doing a double concentration and regret taking my freshman seminar when I could have taken some more requirements which would have opened me up to more exciting classes in my two concentrations.",

I\u2019d probably talk to an advisor about this. Some general advice I can give is to be as credit-efficient as reasonably possible: each class you take should be meaningful to either concentration in some way. 4 classes is good for freshman fall, but if you\u2019re feeling up to it in later semesters consider 5. Juggling two relatively disjoint concentrations is pretty difficult (mine are also very unrelated), and taking more classes/more relevant classes earlier on would have saved me a lot of trouble now",

OK, just be yourself, join some stuff (clubs, whatever), be affable, do your homework... sounds basic... this works.  You are in the same boat as others, so many are pretending to be confident and together (when they are screaming inside) ..... in terms of \"horrible\"...  I wonder what is so \"horrible\"?... whether you are at a community college or Harvard, you need to be the creator of your good day.... It is important that you share your feelings with others, including counselors... in 3-4 weeks, I think you will find that you are in one of the most awesome environments imaginable. GOOD LUCK and hope you feel better soon... but it could take a while to get settled.",

YES YES, these initial camp things are great for some people but in a few weeks, a new set of relationships will start to emerge and new friendships etc.. and those will be your friends during college.... You likely have some very cool and meaningful qualities that don't involve being a V..dict.... or speaker at graduation or a professional figure skater... YOU ARE YOU and that is cool!!!!  You belong and you need a bit of confidence ... You are probably a humble/modest person who does not walk around with a big sign on their forehead \"yeah, I am all that\"....  just laugh it off and find your friends and soak up the activities and your interests and it will all happen... be cool, don't look cool... and GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!",

Depending on your proctor, some are not very chill, rather condescending and apparently you aren\u2019t allowed to have other Harvard students in your dorm from another dorm which can be enforced depending on your proctor.  There are some seriously depressing things about the Harvard living environment that don\u2019t make for a great time that might be affecting your anxiety. Not being able to sleep because it\u2019s so freaking hot and being disgusted every time you have to use the bathroom sucks.  Good luck and hang in there.",

Please don\u2019t fall into the trap of thinking they merely indicate something in your environment is wrong and if you just fix it you\u2019ll feel perfect. If you are experiencing depression and anxiety get support for them. There are tons of options including services on campus (CAMHS) and elsewhere.",

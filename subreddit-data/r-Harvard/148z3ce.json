So I haven't taken my final exams yet but recently I've been really sick and I'm facing problems with my family. \n\nI'm expecting to get lower grades, even though I maintained straight As but senior year was very tough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow bad do my grades have to get for them to rescind my acceptance? What do you guys think?",

Obviously they have more straight A students than they can admit but there is an underlying expectation that B is a minimum. I am not saying that Cs will automatically disqualify you, but they would likely trigger a review process. Admission folks have better things to do than to re-review students with B grades. \nI hope you are able to pull through this rough patch.",

    "postText": "Hi all. I recently applied to a post-baccalaureate program at the SEAS at Harvard ([here](https://seas.harvard.edu/office-diversity-inclusion-and-belonging/programs/post-baccalaureate-program)) because it seems like the best way to continue pursuing STEM research while taking classes before I apply to PhD programs.\n\nDoes anyone know about the timeline of the program? It seems to me like it is a pilot program. Any information would be appreciated! Thank you!",

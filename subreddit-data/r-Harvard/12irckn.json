    "postText": "Hey everyone!   \n\n\nI'm moving to Cambridge this summer and just got a Peabody Terrace apartment through Harvard Housing. It's a basement unit in Building C (#12 on google maps) with windows facing East (map attached). Does anyone know whether it's a true basement apartment (as in located below the ground) or it's located right on the ground floor? I  will not be able to come to check it before my lease starts (I live quite far away), and the building pics that I see on the internet suggest that it might be located on the ground floor...  \n\n\nWould be happy to hear any other thoughts/opinions on Peabody Terrace as well!\n\n\nUPDATE: I think the floor plan they provided might be wrong, and the windows actually face West, in which case it\u2019d be a true basement apartment sadly\n\n\n[location of windows](https://preview.redd.it/3ni1z3jmkata1.png?width=2424&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e62cb2acd8a05d80f79e18da44ac9307e6829c2e)\n\n[apartment location in red](https://preview.redd.it/f12pg97dhata1.png?width=1212&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5223a6a82894ece672c96167dae7908978470671)",

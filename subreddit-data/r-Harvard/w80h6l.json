    "postText": "Incoming freshman trying to plan out my courses. I'm looking to take CS50 in the fall (like everyone else). However, there's this GenEd that I really want to take that runs in person at the same time as the CS50 lecture. The GenEd runs Mondays from 1:30 - 2:45 and CS50 runs Mondays from 1:30 - 4:15.\n\nI was wondering how viable it would be to take both courses and arrive late to the lecture? Since CS50 is free online I was thinking of watching the day's lecture beforehand so I'm not confused when I arrive. Or not showing up to the in-person classes on Mondays at all and watching recordings on my own.\n\nI'm not planning to concentrate in CS but I'm thinking of doing it as a secondary. I have no prior CS experience.\n\nThoughts?",

            "comment": "CS 50 is usually one of the courses approved for simultaneous enrollment, which means you can go to the Gen Ed lecture and watch the CS 50 lecture later. Definitely talk to your adviser about it, but here\u2019s more info: https://oue.fas.harvard.edu/simultaneous-enrollment.",

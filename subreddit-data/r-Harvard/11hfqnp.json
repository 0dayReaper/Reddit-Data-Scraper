I think there's a couple \"weird\" dorms like Greenough that do happen to have it. It will be hot when you arrive for a month or so, then you'll be fine the rest of the year. Don't worry about where you're living and just enjoy it since you don't have a choice anyways!",

I\u2019ve seen fancier dorms and crappier dorms. But at the end of the day if you want to pick your school based on the dorms you\u2019re doing it wrong.",

Most other colleges have terrible dorms (very small rooms, many shared bathrooms with the entire hall, forced triples, etc). Harvard\u2019s dorms aren\u2019t spectacular, but in terms of space and amenities they are above average at least, especially once you get into your upperclass house.",

It's not the end of the world, but it's absolutely not the case that \"most other colleges have terrible dorm rooms\" compared to H, though yes many will have shared bathrooms for the floor just like most at H are shared between suites. You can point to the Quad or you can point to the River, but they're average to below average depending on what you care about.",

The typical dorms at most of them have that jail cell aesthetic and are overcrowded. Many schools do have one or two nice buildings, but it\u2019s rare. The typical university dorm is like trying to fit two people in a Mather low rise bedroom. It\u2019s also pretty hard to make the case for AC when it isn\u2019t needed from late September to late April.",

I'm not comparing random small colleges that are in completely different leagues.\n\n&gt;It\u2019s also pretty hard to make the case for AC when it isn\u2019t needed from late September to late April.\n\nGoing to disagree there too, as well as better ventilation in general. I recognize you have skin in this game, but you're having to go by arbitrary things you're deciding should be what matter like cement construction. We take it on dining halls though!",

If you break your leg then good luck. \n\nWater is a huge issue, they'll blatantly tell you to use the bathroom taps bc you'll often have a single water fountain for the entire 4 floors of a building (Stoughton), I remember needing a map of water fountains in the yard after repeated attempts to improve it. Which HSA uses to it's advantage honestly. \n\nRooms suck (Stoughton) and you'll have old wooden floors that cave in making you sleep tilted to one side, ceilings that are inclined cutting off space to sit up in bed, you'll often hear stories of students hitting their heads after waking up. \n\nOf course there's exceptions and recently renovated rooms and suites that are amazing. But you'll find some awful rooms you'd never expect at a place like this.\n\nThey're the worst dorms I've ever visited, to say they're on par with other colleges is laughable when you check even MIT or across the river, let alone any other liberal arts college.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a rising sophomore student looking to work in AI after college, probably concentrating in Applied Math or CS. The main things I want to learn from college are Linear Algebra, Vector Calculus, and Probability. I don\u2019t really care about grades and I probably won\u2019t do grad school. I\u2019m trying to spend the least amount of time necessary to pass and I\u2019m looking for easy ways to get course credit without much work per week. Advice and tips (especially on easy courses or concentrations) would be much appreciated!",

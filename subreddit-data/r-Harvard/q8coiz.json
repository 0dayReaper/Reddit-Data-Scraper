We got to the richest institution and yet if one didn't know that, it wouldn't be obvious if you're a student. The food sucks, the shuttles suck, the gyms suck, the pay for employees and grad students suck, mental health services suck, the houses have literal roach infestations and mushrooms growing in the floor. Oh at least we get a hundred 350 dollar chairs in the yard lol.\n\nSorry, I know I'm complaining a lot, just have felt very frustrated with Harvard lately.",

I tried their mental health services a few months ago... all they did was refer me to 2 other websites of other mental health services.\n\nAs a grad student I spent almost all of covid local; i run and work out at the track a lot and they couldn't afford to place portajohns at the track until Sep 2021. Meanwhile in the spring of 2021 I saw Harvard track athletes training at the indoor track without wearing masks... while us lab grad students still had extremely limited lab access due to covid, just to show Harvard's priorities.\n\nGrad students are planning a massive strike in 2 weeks because Harvard can't afford fair pay and benefits. So maybe that will make them rethink like the strike did back in 2019.\n\nDining hall workers striked for weeks back in like 2016.",

(It seems so generally at least) I hope things will work out for the grad students favor.\n\nI've given up on CAMHS tbh, I was able to get a psychiatrist through them but that was only because I had a mental health leave of absence so it seems like I was prioritized. I'm not sure if id be able to have one if not for that. As for therapists, I'm just glad the insurance covers 52 visits for people outside camhs. Which also wasn't a thing before the pandemic!!! They literally only covered 8 visits, which is practically 2-3 months of care. Super frustrating regardless",

In truth it seems to me that there's a good portion of grad students in the hard sciences (physics, chem, engineering, etc) that don't feel strongly enough about the strike issues to actually go on strike (myself included) so we'll see how that pans out, since I think as last time the strike isn't mandatory for everyone.\n\nThat's great that they're covering more visits for mental health. Mental health support is something every university needs to continue working on, as it's so so stressful for everyone, just look at the suicide numbers (which I've heard Harvard hides by placing suicidal students on a mandatory leave of absence). My undergrad institution was known to have typically one to a few per year. But I think they need to invest more in on-campus help rather than trying to outsource it.",

So maybe that will make them rethink\n\nin my opinion (also a lab grad student &amp; active in the union) this is the most important function of HGSU: as the only unionized academic workers on campus, we're essentially the shock troops in the war over whether Harvard is a university, or a hedge fund with a school attached. \n\nStudent government and the faculty senate are great, but their power is largely limited to asking nicely. I think a successful strike, with faculty, postdocs, and undergrads showing solidarity instead of \"working to minimize disruption\" like admins are asking them to, could do a lot to make the purse-holders start taking academics' priorities seriously again! If this is important to you, I'd encourage you to think of a way you'd be willing to contribute to sending the strike message\u2014maybe you could ask your PI to write a note to Provost Garber?\n\nalso fyi\u2014the university's bargaining team has been rejecting HGSU's request to form a multilateral working group to improve mental health services (see article 10, \u00a711B in [the university's most recent offer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BCWwXxQ4BEjDT9l13GvfXz-yr9XS8sVs/edit)), but they did at least assure us they'd maintain the 52-visit limit instead of going back to 8.",

It takes a court order to change that (and must stay close to the spirit of the gift), usually after the donor is long dead and their heirs have forgotten about it. It's not like they just get that revenue to use as they see fit. It does help by taking some of the pressure off the rest of the budget, but not as much as you'd think because donors often want to pay for things the institution wasn't otherwise providing. On the email question, it seems to be a school by school issue, because grads of my school do get alumni emails. Talk to you school maybe?",

Best part is that it's all tax free since university endowments are non profit.\n\nAs far as your response on the email, only a couple of harvard schools (3/11) get their own alumni emails, most do not and especially not the college.\n\nThe issue here is that as 1 of the 8 Ivy League schools, we are currently the only school that does not offer an email service for all of our alumni. All of the other Ivy League schools at minimum have a email forwarding service but most offer a full gmail suite. Hell, even Yale offers a full lifetime gmail suite for all their alumni, that's gotta say something.\n\nConsidering now that even non Ivy League schools are offering lifetime alumni email services for all their alumni (eg. Rutgers, Penn State), how does that reflect on us as an institution? No one else seems to have \"technological issues\" and then choose to just shut down the program entirely.

I held a position funded by the interest from an endowment. The interest earned could only be used to fund that position and absolutely nothing else. In this case, the donor was still around and we went back to them because we had accumulated a surplus of interest income after a good year; we asked if we could use it for a different but directly related purpose and they said no. So that was that. A portion of the interest income (capital gains) is reinvested into the endowed fund so the endowed principle continues to grow but it stays with the fund and cannot be used for other purposes.",

    "postText": "Prefrosh here. Okay hear me out, they both fulfill the divisional distribution requirement and the quantitative reasoning requirement. I got placed in Math 1B, but I\u2019m thinking of taking physics instead to fulfill the requirement. I want to concentrate in government but I took AP physics and AP physics C in HS and I did pretty well at it (especially the mechanics part). But on the q guide the physics looks better than the math. Thoughts on taking physics instead of math? Does one have less of a workload or is one easier to get a good grade? Thanks for your help",

Technically Physics 15a needs Math 1b as a coreqquisite, although you can probably forgo if you aced calc in HS. However, most of the students in 15a will likely be taking Math 21a or similar.\n\nComparison via q guide is tough since 1b instructors change and 15a is usually the same. My guess is that the 1b workload would be far less. I will say though that 15a is quite different from AP Physics in both breadth and depth, and the psets are pretty time consuming.",

Definitely put thought into the type of family you request, whether it\u2019s people that are in the field you want to be in, or whether they have interests that are a bit different. I went the latter route - I wanted a family that could take me to fun arts events since I was surrounded by STEM all the time at school.",

It ended up being great to have someone who had friends at other nearby schools they could introduce me to, not to mention insider tips on where to shop/eat/go and what to avoid. I went home with another roommate to Maine for Thanksgiving weekend, so got to experience that as well. By contrast, friends I made later had only roommates from very similar backgrounds, which may have been comforting, so you decide what best fits your needs. Just know the option is there.",

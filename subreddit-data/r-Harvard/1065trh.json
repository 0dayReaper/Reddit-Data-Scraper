I'm not the most confident in myself, and selectivity can develop bad insecurities in me tbh :/, but I'm willing to put myself in discomfort to develop thick skin.\n\nDo you think it's going to be alright and I'll just have to learn or will it break me?",

It\u2019s less a statement of someone\u2019s ability than fit at a given point in time. If you\u2019re really interested in something and don\u2019t get in, reapply! Sometimes networking with upperclassmen can help too.",

Unless you're looking to do preprofessional work right out of high school, it probably won't be an issue. They also tend to take up a large amount of your time compared to the usual club sports and affinity groups, so don't expect to be able to do all that many.",

            "comment": "I think first years think about comping clubs way more than they should. A lot of the value that you get out of being in an organization from a preprofessional standpoint is learning how organizations work. \n\nFor that purpose it doesn't really matter what club you are a part of, just that you are consistent enough with your involvement that you are able to become leadership. So just choose something that you enjoy doing on a consistent basis and stick with it.\n\nPeople are too serious about the selection process. Half of the committee of people making decisions are teenagers. They take themselves very seriously sometimes, but they are your age and are as clueless as you are.\n\nHRSFA and HUBBLE(HAPIE) are both pretty great. They are the sci-fi and board game club respectively, and they have no comp. I can send you a link to their discords if you want.",

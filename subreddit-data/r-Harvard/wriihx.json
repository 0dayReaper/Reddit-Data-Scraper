Research at my department\u2019s lab is, as far as I know, unpaid, but I don\u2019t know how to approach funding. The remote internship would definitely provide more money.\n\nFor context: considering law school",

Do whichever you think you'd like more. \n\nPersonally, I like getting paid for my work, so it would be an easy decision. If you think you'd prefer the research position, definitely find out if there are funding opportunities.",

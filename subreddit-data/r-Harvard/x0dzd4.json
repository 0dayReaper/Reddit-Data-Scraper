I'm sitting here thinking I can't be the only one worried about how it's all going to work over the next few years. \n\nIf you're sat thinking the same, feel free to reach out to me. We might be able to brainstorm ideas to help our situation collaboratively!\n\nHope everyone is doing well!",

Two specifically are teaching through the summer school and there's a 'design your own two week course' that I've heard pays pretty well.\nCafe Gato Rojo I think is student run, and usually hires international students who aren't allowed to work outside of Harvard.\n\nBe sure to contact the HIO about VISA working limitations though.\n\nAdditionally you can work for GSAS or work in the dorms (after your first year)",

I\u2019m doing a Masters in Regional Studies in the GSAS.\n\nThe options you\u2019ve mentioned look great - very kind of you to suggest them.\n\nI\u2019ve started putting together a group to work out methods of crowd funding a small group of students (anyone reading this who\u2019s position is relatable is welcome!)",

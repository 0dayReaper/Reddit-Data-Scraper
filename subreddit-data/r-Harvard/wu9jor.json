Maybe I'm dumb by Harvard standards but 5 at Harvard feels like an awful lot of work given the classes I've taken.\n\nThere was an old Crimson [article](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/11/1/students-take-six-classes) discussing students taking as many as 6. Apparently (in 2011 at least) you could petition Ad Board for 7. I wouldn't recommend this, and one of the students in the article almost broke down in tears over getting 5 A's and 1 A-, after spending an entire semester doing only studying, as the article describes.",

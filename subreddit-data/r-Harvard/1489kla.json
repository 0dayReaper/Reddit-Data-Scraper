    "postText": "Has anyone else on here applied for a graduate loan through HUECU as an international student that doesn\u2019t have a visa or passport? I\u2019m currently a DACA recipient but the application is requiring a US passport (which I don\u2019t have). Any chance someone on here has successfully completed this loan process and successfully worked with HUECU to bypass this requirement?",

What country, the workload, credits work, activities, etc etc. Also was wondering on a general scale if these programs are on the competitive side.\n\nFor me, I'm planning on studying in a Latin american country for a citation in spanish, so if anyone studied anything similar that'd be great to hear, but regardless I'm interested to hear anybody's experience!",

            "comment": "I studied abroad in Europe term-time junior year. It\u2019s actually pretty uncommon to take a term abroad at Harvard, but I absolutely loved it. The trade off is missing out on some Harvard events on campus of course. Study abroad credits turn into pass-fail for Harvard but did count for a couple of my concentration requirements. Workload was chill compared to Harvard, my classmates were from other American colleges and the assignments weren\u2019t as rigorous imo. Pros of course was the easy travel around Europe for the semester. And my financial aid transferred over to cover the tuition.",

It was an immersive German course designed to be second year German and also satisfied part of the core requirements (yup, I was a student before gen ed). Put me ahead in credits (I counted as a full year course), satisfied one of my cores, and put me a year ahead in German. I met some awesome friends on the trip, most of whom I still keep in touch with 15 years later, and it was super fun. They class was long and the homework was what you\u2019d expect for a year\u2019s worth of language course in 6 weeks. But we got to travel (both as part of the course and on our own), our afternoons, evenings, nights, and weekends were our own, and overall it wasn\u2019t so bad. I would do it again in a heartbeat.\n\nI was a chemistry concentrator. I managed to get a citation in German. I probably could have gotten a secondary, but I didn\u2019t care to take a 100-level German literature course to do it and settled for the citation. Because I was ahead in credits and knocked off a core, I took 3 classes both semesters of my senior year and had Mondays and Fridays off all year. It was awesome.",

Except for the advanced math and modeling we did in physical chemistry, I use next to nothing I learned in college to do my job. Everything I use on a daily basis I learned on the job. \n\nMy German was for me. I wanted to learn the language; I enjoyed German A so I studied abroad; I\u2019ve used it traveling once since college, but I occasionally find people to talk to who also speak it. Sadly there are very few German speakers in the Boston area (relative to other parts of the country).",

I tried getting some textbooks but it's difficult to hear the words on paper if that makes sense. I've been wanting to learn because I have a friend who is German and I would like to learn it.

The way the past and future tenses work is also a bit complicated. I would suggest using something like duolingo or Memrise to build vocabulary, but you really should get some actual instruction with a tutor to learn the language. Italki is a web-based service that pairs you with tutors. I\u2019ve never tried it, but I\u2019ve looked into it a bit. Harvard\u2019s German classes are excellent. If you have room in your schedule, try taking German A. The Harvard German Club might also be able to steer you in the right direction.",

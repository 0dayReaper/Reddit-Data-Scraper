    "postText": "They have very similar descriptions, except of course you'd get two semesters of instruction with the intensive version in one term, despite both classes being taught to students with \"little or no knowledge of German\". Almost makes it seem like you should always do the intensive version? I know the intensive version is obviously harder, but I'm wondering to what degree? Has anyone taken either that can recommend which to do?\n\nI am starting from zero German language knowledge btw.",

Learning a language in a shorter span of time will be more difficult. You\u2019ll want to consider if you\u2019re taking other difficult courses the same semester, how many hours you\u2019ll spend on school work vs other things (extracurriculars/having a social life)",

If you\u2019re interested in languages, I\u2019d HIGHLY recommend the intensive class if you can fit it into your schedule - at least when I took it, it was a really excellent class, and the other students were all invested in learning a lot.",

If so, unless things have changed in the last couple years, since intensive German counts as two classes, you can't take it + 3 others.  (So my first-year fall, I took Math 23a, Expos 20, and German, and that was a full courseload.)  But if you can fit it, I would very much recommend it.  I actually found it to be a nice transition into college from high school, since it met every day.  I found the workload pretty manageable - it did have daily homework, but I don't remember it being a *huge* time commitment.",

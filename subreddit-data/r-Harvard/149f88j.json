            "comment": "As an alum, if I were applying nowadays, I might not be considered to be \"good enough\" to be admitted, even though I did fine during and after. The \"impostor syndrome\" feeling is common among students, but I can only imagine how stacked your CVs are nowadays.\n\nIn terms of the pressure to do certain things that you're not interested in, my advice would be think about why you're doing it. Although ideally we all would only do what we're 100% passionate about, there is a reality that for certain next steps--if you wish to pursue them--sometimes you have to explore certain pursuits or do certain things to maintain competitiveness for things like med school. Otherwise, if the next step after college is a career rather than additional school/training, who are you trying to impress? At some point, you have to be honest with yourself about how you're spending your most valuable resource--time--and how to use it in the most impactful way.",

I never figured out exactly why this happened, but I did learn to ignore it.  During the last few weeks around graduation, the most common compliment that I received was  that I was well liked by my class.  While that wasn't my goal, it did help me understand that some condescending behavior of others is a response to the stress that they, themselves, feel.",

            "comment": "Nope. Never. \nWhen I was young, I had a blue collar job. I came from a blue collar family. My grandfather died and I got a few thousand inheritance...Enough to put a down payment on a $50,000 house way out in the sticks. \n\nI showed up to the lawyers office after work to sign at closing. I was wearing my work clothes, stained with machine grime and smelling like chemical coolant. Everyone else was dressed business casual with perfect hair. It was a really nice office. It was the most \"I don't belong here\" out of place alienation I'd ever felt in my life. I felt like a complete imposter.\n\nThe next day I couldn't stop thinking about that feeling. I decided right then and there that I would do whatever it took to never feel that way again. Fast forward almost 20 years. I got out of blue collar labor on raw talent and self taught skill. I learned everything I could from leading entrepreneurial minds through my job and moved up in my career. I self-educated in art, history and culture. I became a first generation college student. I graduated and achieved what nobody in my family for generations had achieved. \n\nThen I enrolled in a graduate program at Harvard.\n\nI'm a minority. I came from a very economically depressed region. Everyone I was friends with in highschool dropped out except me. I BARELY passed my senior year of high school at the bottom of my class - within two points of failing two core classes. Statistically speaking, someone like me is never supposed to get anywhere near Harvard. But by the time I walked through the gates for the first time, I had unshakable self confidence.\n\nNow, nobody can ever make me feel the way I felt that day many years ago. Not because I have a fancy ivy league diploma...but just because I can look back at my life and with confidence say I made more out of what little I had to work with than many who had much more. It's never been about grabbing or flaunting the Harvard \"prestige\" for me. The diploma on my wall represents everything I had to overcome to get through those gates. \n\nAny time spent pondering \"am I really supposed to be here?\" \"Do I really deserve this opportunity?\" That's time wasted. Opportunities are not distributed equally. When you get one, you just say yes to opportunity. Because one day, the opportunities STOP. \ud83e\udea6\n\nAs far as trying to live up to a stereotype or idea of what a harvard student is, understand that Harvard does not need the exact same student they've had for the last 10 generations. The only way to be relevant is to constantly innovate. To that end, Harvard doesn't need you to be a \"model\" student or fit a traditional mold. They NEED you to be YOU. If the student body doesn't change with the times, they wither and die. Your only responsibility is creating the Harvard student of the future. And you get to determine what that is! It's an awesome opportunity. Make the most of it!",

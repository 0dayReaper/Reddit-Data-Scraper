    "postText": "Can anyone who took Stat 212 or CS 238 speak to how the classes went or advice for deciding between the two?\n\nBoth courses seem interesting to me, with the trade-off (as I see it right now) being that the content in Stat 212 seems more \"canonical\" (stochastic processes seem more important to learn about than social choice theory) but the course ratings for CS 238 are much better.",

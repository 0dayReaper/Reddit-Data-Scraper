    "postText": "Hi all, this is a serious post for Extension alumni of the Graduate Certificate and ALM programs.\n\n1. I understand ALM degree holders are both Harvard University and Harvard Extension Alumni. My question relates to your Extension Alumni status. How valuable is the Harvard Extension alumni worldwide network? Have you reached out to any Extension alumni to help with jobs, close business deals, generate business ideas? If so, were they willing to help you and did the Extension affiliation help with the relationship. I understand Extension alumni are located in major cities around the world and I think that is something that is understated.\n2. For Graduate Certificate holders, has your Associate Alumni status at Extension been of any value? Did you attend any Extension alumni events (such as those in the Harvard Clubs of New York etc) and if so, did they treat you like a regular alum or a second-class alum (due to the Associate only status). Were those events valuable for networking purposes?\n\nThank you so much in advance for the feedback.",

There are some extension school people but mostly other colleges (the college, medical school, Chan school, business school). There are alum from every college scattered.\n\n2. Haven\u2019t met tons of certificate only holders but the one girl I did know, we met at an event at HCNY and it helped her in her legal career. She is finishing up at NYU law.",

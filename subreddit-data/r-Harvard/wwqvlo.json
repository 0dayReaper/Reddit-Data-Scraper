    "postText": "Hi, I wanted to get some offical merch from Harvard,but i am quite not sure where to purchase it from. From my understanding is that there are two places to get offical Harvard merch. That would be the coop and the harvard shop. What i don't understand is what is the difference since from my understanding both of these are offical stores. Can someone please tell me in the comments what the difference between these two stores are since i am reallym confused and couldn't find anything online telling me the difference. Thanks",

            "comment": "They're both official in the sense that both have a legitimate affiliation with the university, but all of the merchandise is different. I've shopped at both depending on which store has what I'm looking for at that moment. \n\nIt's not consistent across the board, but one thing I've noticed is that the red used in Harvard Shop merch tends to be brighter/lighter red than the one used in a lot of Coop merch, which tends to be more maroon/burgundy. There's definitely variation because each store is working with a range of vendors, but that has been a moderately consistent difference.",

There's nothing on them to indicate that they are formally \"endorsed\" by Harvard in any way (because they're not), so I really don't see any value in that respect.\n\nI recommend shopping from these two because they have the largest selection, so you waste less time.",

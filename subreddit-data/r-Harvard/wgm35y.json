    "postText": "I am planning on taking math + physics through this year and thought CS 50 on top of that might be a bit much, as I am also considering Hum 10 and maybe a freshman seminar (if I am lucky enough to get in). CS is a requirement for the concentration I\u2019m hoping to do. How hard would it be to study languages on my own and take CS 61 my sophomore fall? What kinds of things are essential for me to prepare if I want to do CS 61?",

            "comment": "61 is not for the feint of heart. There\u2019s several freshmen who go in thinking they have lot of programming experience and take 61 but drop down to 50 because they have large gaps in knowledge (not necessarily in programming, but in CS).\n\nHere\u2019s the thing about Harvard CS. It\u2019s not about the languages you know. It\u2019s theory based. In all your classes, they\u2019re reiterate that languages are just tools. The languages you know doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s about the concepts. If you try to self study only trying to learn languages while skimming over the conceptual stuff like performance and O(n) and memory management you\u2019re going to be in trouble later down the line.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying No to your question because I have no idea of your programming and CS background. You could maybe just self-study and take 61 if you already have a very good foundation. Otherwise, take CS50. Even for those who have coding experience, it reinforces some good fundamental concepts.",

Not really an answer but wanted to ask if you think taking physics, math, and hum10 was manageable if youve heard any other opinions bc im thinking of doing the same but also want to make friends lol. Btw my PM's are open if you wanna talk more since we are both in a similar dilemma!",

Does anyone have a more specific idea on what things are shaking out to look like this year? Annual housing stress is setting in and am trying to get a general idea of what resident tutor stuff is looking like atm. Thanks!",

Last year it was March 25th, so expect to hear back about offers around the same time this year.",

    "postText": "I've posted this in the past but couldn't get any help, I'm a US Veteran that's using a program that allows me to go to Harvard for 1 week and take a crash course on a subject. This is pretty much going to be the only opportunity I'll ever get to come here, I know I would never be accepted into the school so I'm trying to make the most out of the time I am going to have while there.\n\nI'm going to be there for the last week of July and I'm looking to see if there will be any students while I'm there that could maybe show me around campus and tell me about the school or the local area? \n\nI know what I'm asking for is a long shot, but there's gotta be a better idea than downloading tinder when I get there and asking people the same thing while there haha.",

Harvard is trying to increase their veteran population slowly over time, and they highly value diversity of background/experience in their applicants. I would encourage you to apply even if you don't think you have a chance, especially since the application fee is free for military on CommonApp.\n\nAs for tours, you could always sign up for a Trademark Tour - they're the official tour guides of the campus. I've never been on one myself but they seem pretty popular.\n\nHope you have a good time while you're here!",

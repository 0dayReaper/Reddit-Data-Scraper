    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nTLDR: Statistics/Applied Math student deciding between Harvard and Yale. Any input is appreciated.\n\nWould you mind giving me the Pros and Cons of studying Applied Math / Stats at Harvard?\n\nI didn't wanna post this on A2C cuz a lot of people are depressed from the decisions and don't wanna hurt them. But long story short, I've narrowed my college choice down to Harvard and Yale. I don't think I can pick based on prestige at this level (though many would say Harvard is slightly above the other 2). As of now, I don't know what career I wanna pursue or if I plan to go to graduate school. I've talked with a few Stanford students, and they say that the math professors there are unfriendly, which kinda pushes me toward Harvard and Yale. I really just want to have a good 4-year experience and excellent opportunities post-grad. Would you say that the latter is equally true for all three schools?",

            "comment": "I\u2019m in a similar situation, and I\u2019ll be picking Harvard. To be honest, Harvard tops Yale for Statistics/Applied Math. Also, you can cross-register for math classes at MIT, which is unbeatable for all things STEM. If you\u2019re interested in finance at all, which I assume you might be, Harvard is also better than Yale for that, with some top firms supposedly recruiting Math &amp; CS peeps exclusively from Harvard and MIT. \n\nAlso, from your post history (hehe) it seems you\u2019re also interested in CS/Statistics. You can do a joint concentration in CS + Statistics (or even Applied Math + CS) and get your master's degree in 4 years at Harvard. I\u2019m not sure if Yale has something similar, but that\u2019s definitely something to consider IMO.\n\nedit: Boston/Cambridge &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; New Haven",

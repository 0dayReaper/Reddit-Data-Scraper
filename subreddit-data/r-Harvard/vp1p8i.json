(Would you recommend one over the other)\n\n2) What kinds of jobs do people usually go on to do after these majors?\n\n3) Thoughts on joint concentration (engineering doesn\u2019t allow it but I was thinking neuro/compsci)?\n\nI\u2019m also thinking about doing a minor in some kind of humanities.\n\nI know that we don\u2019t have to declare for a year but I was hoping to get a good idea of what I wanted to do to plan my courses most efficiently. Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I have no idea what I\u2019m doing yet ! :)",

You haven\u2019t even moved in. \n\nFWIW my informal life advice is this: a concentration (Harvard speak for major) IS NOT A JOB, it\u2019s not a career, It\u2019s not a life. \n\nIt\u2019s just your concentration in college\u2014 and I hope you will find one that helps you have an amazing experience here and beyond. \n\nThat said approach your first year and your course selection with openness and a willingness to explore areas of interest. Who knows, you might even find something really fascinating you have never even considered before. \n\nThe first year really is designed around giving you time to experience Harvard, explore areas of interest, build news ones and explore before you have to pick. \n\nCongrats and welcome!",

There's many others doing MBB in other concentrations, primarily neuroscience. \n\nThere's many research opportunities available, you just need to find a lab that aligns with your interests. For me, I found a \"neuroscience\" lab and applied computer science to their research interests, and I think that's a much easier path to follow than trying to find a computer science lab with neuroscience applications. Unless of course you want to do comp neuro, for which there exist dedicated labs for that kind of research. \n\nIdeally your mentors will be the PIs of the research lab you join, as other CS MBB faculty are relatively few and far between. I will say that it's useful to find someone to talk to that is separate from your lab just to get a different perspective. For example, I met with Stuart Shieber (a CS MBB faculty) a couple of times when I was writing my thesis just to help ensure that I was still on the right track for a \"CS\" thesis. \n\nLMK if you have any other questions!",

I have yet to see a pure neuroscience major that isn't also planning to go premed or studying some other discipline in conjunction with neuro (e.g. CS is a popular one). If you're not pre-med, then most neuroscience majors will go into research after graduation, which isn't a field that (many) people will stay in for a long time due to salary expectations and stability. \n\nIn short, studying just neuroscience doesn't give you many career options, while CS does. If you're studying CS, you can go into software engineering, data science, research, etc. Heck, you don't even need to go into a field remotely related to CS. Some CS concentrators will even go into consulting or investment banking.",

More important to load up on strong math (and adjacent) and/or CS classes (depending on quant type), than it is to do a specific major.\n\nSimilarly, interested in being a software engineer?  CS is the obvious choice, but most SWE hiring pipelines essentially initially filter (via resume) for \"have you coded\" and then \"can you pass our coding screen exams\" (which are very passable with study, largely regardless of your concentration).\n\nLaw school?  GPA is mostly the thing.\n\nEtc.\n\nQED--\n\n1) chill out :) \n\n2) focus on either what jobs you are interested in, and work backwards into any requisite coursework/prep; and/or,\n\n3) focus on what coursework you want to actually do, i.e., that you actually enjoy\n\nBest case is to pick overlap of #2 and #3, and roll forward from there.  If you like lots of things and aren't sure what to focus on...just be crass and work backwards from the most lucrative jobs.

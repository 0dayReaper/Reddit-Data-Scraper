I will be here for a couple of months until I go back to the UK. \n\nI don't really know anyone here in Cambridge since I just arrived and got my HUID. \n\nI was wondering whether there is someone on this subreddit that wants to play Tennis (I would say that my level is intermediate-advanced). \n\nThanks in advance!",

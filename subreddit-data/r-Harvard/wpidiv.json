    "postText": "I have no experience with Stats. I\u2019m debating taking Stat100 in the fall or taking Sociol 1156 (stats for sociology) in the spring. I think it would be nice to take a stat specific to my concentration but I\u2019m worried I need some prior knowledge in stats to succeed. Only thing is that it was an old class that got removed then re-added so there\u2019s no qguide or anything. Has anyone taken sociol156\u2026how was it? Or should I stick to stat100? Any information is appreciated! Thanks!",

    "postText": "I'll have to take Stat 111 and Math 22b, but I also want to get a machine learning class in, so I'm considering CS181 and MIT 6.3900(/6.036). 181, 11, and 22b letter-graded is definitely not in the cards, so how much easier is it if 181 is pass-fail? I've done some ML and ML/linalg on my own, but I want to learn it formally. \n\n(And, on this same topic, is 6.3900 or CS181 (P/F) a better choice? I have enough space in my schedule so I don't have to take either for concentration credit, so that's not an issue for 6.3900--I'm mainly concerned with the messy scheduling with MIT and the commute cutting into the saved time from it being easier)",

You could just take it next year if you\u2019re a freshmen or something.\n\nThat said if you have good time management skills and math prep (which it seems like you do based on your course schedule), you could probably do 181, 111, and 22b with an easy 4th course.\n\nAs for commute time, that\u2019s again going to be based on time management. Even commuting to the SEC each day could make someone lose an hr of time.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm an incoming freshman, and I am thinking about renting the microfridge and getting the heavy water delivery plan, but I don't know if it is worth it or if I'll even use it that much. I've also heard that HSA is kind of a scam too lmao. Should I buy my own mini fridge? How often do you use the microwave? Is it easy to fill up your water bottle? Sorry for all the questions, but I just want to be prepared. Thank you in advance :)\n\nIf it helps, I'm going to be living in Thayer :)",

I got a Brita filter and filled it up with tap water from the bathroom. Having an in suite bathroom helps, but you can also fill up multiple bottles with tap at once and filter them in your room. This isn't too bad and is much cheaper than the water plan.",

Didn\u2019t have to worry about storing it over the summer. I would do it again.\n\nThat being said, if you\u2019re fine with just getting a water filter and a kettle then you don\u2019t necessarily need it.",

I use the microwave often for dhall leftovers, restaurant leftovers, and I have packs of ramen noodles/instant oatmeal I microwave and eat sometimes too. I used the fridge a lot too. Yes it's overpriced, but for me, storing and moving a fridge is just not going to happen. Plus if something goes wrong, HSA just gives you a new one. Idk much about water delivery though since i didn't need it (not an athlete and brought my own water filter).",

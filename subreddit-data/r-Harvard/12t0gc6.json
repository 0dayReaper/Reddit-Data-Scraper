Also heard that if you are quaded, the shuttle ride to Allston can take 35 minutes or more if traffic is bad.  Is this true?  Is it a pain being a CS major for this reason at Harvard?  How do students go back and forth?  What if I want to double major in a humanities and CS?  Is it next to impossible to have to go back and forth between the 2 areas?  Is this ever a problem for anyone (especially if you're quaded)?",

            "comment": "CS major living in the quad here. \n\n- Yes, most CS classes are in the SEC. \n- It\u2019s a 30 minute walk, 15 minute shuttle and bike to the SEC from Cabot (contingent on the Quad-SEC direct being there when you wish to leave).\n- It\u2019s rarely snowy enough here that biking isn\u2019t feasible. It can be rainy sometimes to make it uncomfortable. \n\nSEC located classes are on a slightly offset schedule from regular yard classes to accommodate the extra commute. For example, the earliest class in the yard starts a 9:00am, while it starts at 9:45am in the SEC. Additionally, you\u2019ll often be in the yard during the day for your classes/sections, and it\u2019s not that long of a commute from the yard to the SEC.\n\nSure it can be inconvenient but I don\u2019t think you should see it as a major obstacle. I go back and forth all the time, and quad students usually don\u2019t go back to our dorms during the day anyways. And who knows, maybe you\u2019ll get Dunster or Lev or Mather and you\u2019ll be right on the river which isn\u2019t far at all.",

The quad used to be the Radcliffe college before it merged with harvard proper, which is why it\u2019s somewhat removed. And short of buying up the Cambridge commons, there isn\u2019t any space on the north side of the river to build something like the SEC. \n\nCould they put our classes in different buildings? I mean, yeah, but it would lack all the facilities and amenities of the SEC (a thousand private study rooms, outlets in every table in every room and every chair in lecture halls, built in flyby and dining with board+, not to mention all the equipment for engineering concentrators). Personally I prefer the walk, coupled with the benefits of the new billion dollar building, over them hosting CS courses around the yard",

Could MD serve the same purpose? Maybe.. Is it big enough? Are there enough lecture halls?",

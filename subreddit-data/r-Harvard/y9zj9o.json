Which would be better considering Im comfortable with proof based math courses and knowledge of a little better than cs50 and considering that it\u2019ll be one of my harder classes of the semester",

It will make 181 (and other CS classes) easier and some companies care about having 124 for internships.\n\nThe only reason I could think to go the other way is if this year has a bad 124 prof and it\u2019ll be different next year OR 181 has a really good prof this year and is leaving next year. (124 and 181 used to change profs a lot)",

CS181 is a lot of linear algebra and statistics. \n\nYou should pick the topic you are more interested in. You can self study the basics of algorithms without learning too much of the theory, and you can also self study the basics of ML without fully understanding the statistics behind the algorithms. So, neither are practically necessary, so just go with what you find more interesting. I found CS181 to be slightly better taught, if that matters.",

    "postText": "Hi!! Does anybody have experience with applying/enrolling with this program? There isn't much info on the program website. I'm going to reach out to some of the professors soon to learn more but wanted to see if anybody here knows about the program! I'm coming from a music performance background (current Masters student at Yale) but have always had a very passionate interest in combining my skills as a performer with a couple different academic areas (mainly ethnomusicology based) and I'm trying to figure out if this PhD program would be a good fit for me. Thanks in advance!",

I agree it can be a bit hard to tell from the website how exactly would be the best way to frame the artist-scholar nature of one's practice. I'm planning to talk about compositions I've done that were informed by research. If you get the chance, I'd love to hear any further information you find out.",

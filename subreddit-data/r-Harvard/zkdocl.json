    "postText": "Hi, this is my first semester at Harvard.\n\nEarlier this semester, I registered for a MIT course, dropped it in myharvard and thought it was all good. Today I learned that the dropping process involves two steps: (1) Dropping it in myharvard (2) Contacting the Registrar Office at MIT.\n\nHow screwed am I? I haven't submitted any assignments for the MIT class and am worried that I might get an F or whatever on my transcript. I contacted MIT's Registrar office for now but am super worried right now. Asking to hear about similar cases in the past and any suggestions/advice.",

The MIT teaching staff will just be annoyed since they won't have a way to know that you actually dropped it.",

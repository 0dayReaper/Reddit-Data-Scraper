They'll often be mostly a listserv or forum and then find an appropriate bar/pub/restaurant for everyone to get together sometimes. e.g., [Chicago has a larger one](https://www.harvardclubchicago.org/) where everyone discusses how bad the pizza is in Cambridge. They all work like this.\n\nIf you are anywhere near the financial district or have a reason to, do yourself a favor and [head to Mystic Muffin for a slice of the apple cake](https://www.yelp.com/biz/mystic-muffin-toronto).

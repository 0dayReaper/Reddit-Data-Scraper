    "postText": "I\u2019m thinking about applying for the anthropology program specializing in archaeology, specifically South America. I\u2019ve heard some general good reviews from previously alumni, but I\u2019d love to hear the tea/chisme about what it\u2019s actually like. Is there good funding? Job opportunities? Faculty turn over?\n\nI just heard about that one professor, if possible I would also like to hear if there was any outcome to that and if it\u2019s affected the anthropology department at all.\n\nThank you :\u2019)",

It\u2019s unfortunate, but power dynamics in academia mean you have to get the full inside scoop via discrete conversations with current students. But that\u2019s not to say that no one wants to share their experiences! Or to insinuate that people only ever have bad stuff to share. So email some current students, especially those of any PI with whom you want to work. I\u2019ve personally been a big fan since the pandemic of using emails to set up video calls.",

You might have better luck targeting an anthropology specific subreddit, or even dipping into subreddits for PhD students or professors. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure the academic job market for anthro is rough, meaning it\u2019s hard for graduates to land tenure track jobs. Department webpages usually have a section highlighting PhD student placement over the years. I\u2019d check that out \u2014 not just for Harvard but other peer schools.\n\nA lot of these other questions are things to consider after getting accepted, IMO. It\u2019s good to apply broadly.",

I actually plan on working in South America but it\u2019s (generally) seen better to have a western degree than an latam one, but I\u2019ll definitely be sharing this with my cohort :]\n\nAs for the other questions, yeah I figured I would throw them out there to see if anyone had any insights, but I was more curious about the chisme happening with the program. I had two people pm me about it so I definitely have a better idea now. Thank you so much I really appreciate you responding &lt;3",

As you\u2019re probably aware, they don\u2019t have their elite Professor on archeology for LATAM due to various scandals with such profesor (could easily google it to read more). I think there is like one professor who does some work in LATAM, but I didn\u2019t feel too much of a pull to get in touch with them, but spoke with another (non archeology) who gave me some good advice about the program and the field in general. If you applied, awesome! If you waited, I\u2019d suggest looking at what works you\u2019ve been interested in reading/researching and use those professors as your basis to find ~ professors/programs to where you\u2019d want to apply. Email them, set up zoom calls, and cross them off your list until you have a solid group of folks where your research, as well as the mentorship you seek, would be the best fit. This should take you up to next September, which by then you should be pretty sure where you\u2019ll be applying. It\u2019s kinda what I did for a solid year and now I\u2019m also applying to 4 other schools (including Harvard).",

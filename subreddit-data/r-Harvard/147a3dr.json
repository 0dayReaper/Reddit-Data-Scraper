    "postText": "So I am moving to Boston this summer for grad school at HSPH. I don\u2019t want to pay for the student health insurance, it\u2019s wildly expensive and I am married and have kids and need coverage for all of us.  We are both self employed and have had coverage through the marketplace in our state, but will have new jobs after the move.  I am at a loss as to how to navigate this system in MA.  Can students apply for coverage with the marketplace in Mass? Any help would be much appreciated.",

You will qualify for special enrollment because you are presumably losing your old insurance when you move to Mass. \n\n[https://www.mahealthconnector.org/get-started/special-enrollment-period](https://www.mahealthconnector.org/get-started/special-enrollment-period)",

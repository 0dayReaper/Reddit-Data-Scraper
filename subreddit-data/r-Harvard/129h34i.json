    "postText": "Hi everyone! I recently got into Harvard!! However, because of an important competition I'm going to, I'm pretty sure I can't attend Visitas. I think I'm going to choose Harvard no matter what, but I was just wondering about how important Visitas is in terms of getting to know/making friends with other admitted students. Will I be missing out on a lot, and should I cancel my competition to attend? Or is it okay if I first meet my classmates in the fall? Thanks!!",

            "comment": "Not a problem! Harvard still offers a bunch of pre-orientation programs [here](https://dso.college.harvard.edu/pre-orientation) whose main purpose is to let you really connect with students. Visitas (although also a great opportunity to meet people) has a lot of opportunities to feel what Harvard is like (classes, physical spaces, etc.). So if you\u2019re unable to attend, there are still plenty of ways to learn/experience a lot of the same core events. Virtual/in-person tour if you haven\u2019t already, simply reading through the school\u2019s Q-guide (Harvard\u2019s \u201c\u201dRate My Professor\u201d\u201d), or connecting on social media (as you have).",

            "comment": "i was in your exact position when i got accepted and i decided to attend the competition. idk what your competition is but mine was deca icdc, and i don\u2019t regret it at all! that\u2019s bc i was really into deca in high school and that trip to atlanta ended up being one of my favorite memories from high school. i was a little bummed at the time because i was missing visitas, but honestly it\u2019s what you make of it. \n\ni personally don\u2019t think visitas is crazy important in making friends with other students and i don\u2019t feel like i missed out on much at all. my first interaction with most of my peers was when i moved in for a pre-orientation program and i didn\u2019t feel disadvantaged when making friends at all. in my experience, everyone is willing to talk to everyone during those first few weeks because we\u2019re all trying to make new friends in a foreign environment, so i wouldn\u2019t sweat it. ofc, the experience is different for everyone so take this with a grain of salt",

It also gave me a much better feel for the college experience ahead of me.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d skip the competition\u2026 (for me, competitions helped get me into college \u2014 beyond that they were fun, but no longer strategic)",

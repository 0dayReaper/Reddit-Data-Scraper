    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI wanted to ask current students if this is a viable schedule, since meeting with an advisor is a bit confusing and unclear. I plan on taking CS 50, Stat 110, Expos 20 and some math class first semester (still unsure). I understand this is tough, but I will have completed all of CS 50 on EdX by the end of the summer, so effectively I will have only 3 classes. I am looking to concentrate in CS and/or Stats.\n\nOn the same topic, is attending lecture for CS50 mandatory? I think section is but I couldn't find an answer for lecture. ",

The only exception is if you have another class that overlaps and you make the heads of both courses aware (so you don't get penalized.) The ushers scan your ID once you enter Sanders, which is how attendance is taken, so there isn't getting around it. See last year's syllabus on CS50's site [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/fall/syllabus/).",

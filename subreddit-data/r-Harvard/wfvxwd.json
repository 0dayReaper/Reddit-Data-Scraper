            "comment": "If you\u2019re a physics concentrator, do physics 15a. That leaves math 21a, hum10, CS50, seminar. Math 21a is a good idea because you\u2019re a physics concentrator so you should learn that ASAP.\n\nThat leaves CS50, hum10, seminar. As a CS concentrator I\u2019m biased and think CS50 is a great class. Also, lots of physics concentrators end up working with computers (in research, or if you decide to leave and work at any company, etc). However, Physics 15a + Math 21a is already a decent courseload and adding CS50 would make it pretty intense. You will have much less time to make friends outside of your pset groups, do random clubs, smell the roses, etc. But this certainly a possible schedule, and the choice is up to you. \n\nThis leaves Hum10 and the seminar. I don\u2019t see a reason for you to add Hum 10 (especially on top of 2 or 3 of those other classes) when you can take expos. The seminar could be nice as a way to loosen up your workload and meet friends while learning about something you\u2019re interested in in a low-stress environment. There are also lots of other English courses you can take in the future if you decide you really miss books.\n\nI\u2019d recommend physics 15a + math 21a + seminar + (CS50 or an easier 3-8 hr per week class). If you have strong experience with physics 15a material, multivariable calculus, or computer science, taking those 3 together will be more doable.\n\nHope this helps!",

Really appreciate it! :) I did wanna take hum10 because it seemed like a super interesting course, do you think physics, mathz and hum10 would be possible with a seminar? I wanna have time to become tightknit with some ppl too. Im kinda stressed because I want to take these interesting classes but they all take up alot of time and I also dont wanna be a loner\ud83d\udc80.",

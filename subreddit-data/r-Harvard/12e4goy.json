    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m a recent Harvard Class of 2027 admit and was interested in attending Harvard Vistas on April 23-24. I also got admitted into Yale Class of 2027 and wanted to go to Bulldog Day on April 24-26 as well. I\u2019m from Texas and interested in concentrating in government/political science.\n\nI was planning on making my final decision between the two schools after going to Vistas and Bulldog Day. I\u2019m flying alone from Texas into Boston and wanted to plan out logistics for getting from Harvard to Yale (whether that is by bus or train). If there\u2019s anyone else who is planning on going to both please PM me as I want to create a group chat to go together from Harvard to Yale.\n\nI'd also like any advice possible in making my decision - some categories I care about are location, transport, extracurricular access and competitiveness, undergraduate opportunities/support, and vibe, but any advice is helpful!",

            "comment": "You can take the Amtrak from Boston there. Some students do it during Harvard Yale. \n\nThat said, Cambridge is like pretty freaking \u201cnoob friendly\u201d to walk around. We\u2019re all tree lined streets and gentrification. New Haven is less \u201cnoob friendly\u201d. It basically feels like any other city center of a major metropolitan area. Cambridge feels like a posh  suburb. \n\nThat said New Haven pizza is AMAZING. So be sure to get some if you go down! I like\u201dBar\u201d \n\nSo depending on if you\u2019re super familiar with cities or not should guide how you travel: eg make sure to pick a train that gets you in to New Haven not late at night, take Ubers rather than walking, etc. probably less an issue if some of the other students you go down with know cities (sorry you might know cities very well. I didn\u2019t when I went off to college). \n\nAmtrak is probably 1.5-2 hours so it\u2019s doable. One general thought though would be \u201ccan you spend enough time in both locations to actually get a vibe?\u201d\n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t run around too much as you end up half assing a bunch of things and not getting to make any actual connections or get any data about where you will be happier but again that\u2019s just me. \n\nHave fun!",

            "comment": "Treat it like a job. Start/show up at a fixed time, take your lunch, finish up/leave ~8 hours after start time. You might have to stay late/start early when you have deadlines, but it's too easy to fall into the trap of working 24/7 (spoiler, there's always more to do). On the flip side, unlike undergrad the problems/projects you will work on take a lot longer so don't chill until the last minute. \n\nYou can say \"no\" to your advisor. Politely, of course and with reasons. Eg \"Sorry, I don't think I can have that to you by the end of the week because I'm also taking a class. Based on my schedule I think it'll take me __ days.\" On this note, being able to accurately estimate how long you can accomplish something becomes a very useful skill. Be generous to yourself at first. \n\nUndergrad felt like a 400 m dash, grad school (PhD) is much more like a marathon. Make a little progress every day, but also give yourself time for hobbies/health etc. Burn out it real.",

Many people have similar experiences. Do you know why this is? I think it\u2019s either that 1. Research is just hard 2. The amount of time something takes is equal to the amount of time you give yourself to do it, so I could probably honestly fill in my day with classes and clubs if I wanted to but now\nI\u2019m older and lazier so I just say I\u2019m doing research all day long when really I\u2019m probably only truly focused for 4 hours a day and the rest is mindless paper reading, coffee breaks, experimental bs 3. We are old now and just can\u2019t work as hard as we did when we were 19 and full of energy. Maybe it\u2019s some combination of the three. Any thoughts? I feel like I was a beast in undergrad and now im a lethargic mess",

Now I probably am actually more efficient but that makes it seem like I have more free time and therefore should be doing more. I definitely had a lack of awareness for what I was putting my body through at the time. \n\nBut I personally think it's mostly that research is HARD. It's completely new and you're really the most qualified person to be working on that particular problem (in that moment). Who knows if it even has a solution? It's up to you to decide that or figure out the work around. \n\nI also think there's diminishing returns on working on such difficult/convoluted/detail oriented problems and so you can really only expect yourself to be able to do 4 maybe up to 6 hours of it a day - then you gotta let your brain recharge by doing more 'menial' tasks like reading papers, emails, teaching/grading, hobbies, proper amount of sleep etc.. \n\nAs to you point that things take as long as you allow it - for research there could be no end. So I look at it as if I give it more time it will be better, but if I give it less time it will still get done (for the most part) it just might not be very good. Finding the balance is key: when to just submit something that's 'good enough' and move on to the next project.",

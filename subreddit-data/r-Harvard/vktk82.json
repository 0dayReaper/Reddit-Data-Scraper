I plan to concentrate in physics and my prior experience is Calc BC. I know alot of people differ in the math courses they take freshman year but are there any that you think would be most useful as a physics concentrator?",

It tells you what courses are required. Take 21a, end of story for freshman fall. That's all you need to be concerned with right now.  Were you thinking of taking something else, like 25 or 55? \n\nTalk to a faculty advisor in the physics department once you arrive about spring courses.",

Math 22A is best for students who will do concentrations that will require proof-writing (like CS or Applied Math). Math 25A and Math 55A are for students who are strongly considering studying mathematics. They can also be helpful students to gain even more confidence in abstract thinking and proofs for theoretical CS courses.\n\nThat being said, if you have only done BC Calc, it's still possible that you can take 25a; it will just take a lot of time. If so, I would prepare to allocate up to 25 hours per week for that course (could take less, just for caution), take a medium-level STEM course (something other than Physics 16 or CS50), and take two other easier courses (one of them can be expos as the course isn't necessarily time consuming and is required).\n\nHowever, for physics, best bet would be 21A.",

Anyone with a 5 on Calc BC could manage to take 25A but it would take significantly more time than the average student.\n\nTo answer your question, 25a probably isn't a doable course with those other courses based on your background. However, if you really want to take a course like 25a, I would be prepared to spend 80%+ of you academic life on math during the fall semester. Also keep in mind, you might be placed into expos in the fall.",

Like no, tons of physics concentrators take 22 or 23.\n\nIn fact, if you feel you are ready for 22 or 23, do take them over 21. I took 23 with just Calc BC, and I'm very happy I did and it turned out just fine (now 23 isn't a well designed class so I recommend 22, but I learned a lot). As a physics major, you want to be exposed to advanced and abstract mathematical concepts and teachings earlier rather than later, particularly if you have any interest in theoretical physics (where it is a must). I'm not saying 21 isn't enough, just that 22 or 23 will give you a better base off of which you can take higher level math.\n\nAs for 25 and 55, yes they are mostly for math people, and it's unlikely you'll be prepared for 25 with just Calc BC. Feel free to ask me anything",

Make no mistake, Math 22 will be taught at a higher level than what you're used to in math, but it's about building a good foundation to learn advanced math. Most people in 22/23 come in just with BC calc. Workload wise, I think 21 and 22 should be fairly comparable. With 21, you have more frequent but shorter assignments per week, but 22 you get one assignment per week. But I think your time will be better spent in 22.\n\nMain pro of 22 is that you will learn linear algebra and multivariable calc in a proof based style, and you'll develop a better foundation to take abstract algebra later on (things like group theory, which is essential for theoretical high energy physics). It'll also be a smaller class so it'll be easier to make friends and find your math and physics crowd.",

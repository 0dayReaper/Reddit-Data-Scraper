            "comment": "Thanks for your interest in Stat 111! I teach both Stat 110 and 111. When I list 110 as a prereq for 111, I mean that. Stat 110 is considered a challenging course, and 111 builds on the foundation from 110. Almost all the main concepts introduced in 110 are needed in 111.\n\nAll of the following topics get applied in 111: conditional probability (especially Bayes' rule and LOTP), random variables and their distributions, famous distributions (Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Beta, Expo, etc.), stories (e.g., capture-recapture and chicken-egg), Universality of the Uniform, indicator random variables, expectation, linearity, LOTUS, variance, covariance, order statistics, conditional expectation, Jensen's inequality, the Law of Large Numbers, and the Central Limit Theorem. And there may be more topics from 110 that come up as well, such as Markov chains.\n\nThis is way too much to learn on the fly, so in my opinion it's a very bad idea to take 111 without first having a good understanding of the 110 material. Occasionally students self-study the 110 material rather than formally registering for it, and then take 111. You can find extensive materials for self-study at [https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110](https://stat110.net) (lecture videos, online version of the book, practice problems etc.). If you do that, make sure to solve a lot of practice problems rather than just passively reading/watching videos. It's harder and less fun to learn all the material on your own, without sections, office hours, friends to study with, and the course structure in general, but I know a few students who have done that successfully (generally by studying 110 over the summer though, not during the much shorter January break).",

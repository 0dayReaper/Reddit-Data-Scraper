Then drown in work and exams in math 55 while adjusting to your first semester in college.\n\nEven if you are placed in the proper class, it might not make sense. I took 6 years of Latin in grades 7-12. I got 5s on the AP Latin 4 and 5 exams. On the Latin placement exam, I was placed into 100-level Latin. On the first day of some 100-level course I considered I realized two things: 1. This course was beyond my skill level. 2. I really didn\u2019t want to keep studying Latin.",

Also, it only matters if you think you want to get into Hum10, in which case you have to do well enough to be recommended to take Expos20 in the Fall I believe. Other than that, literally don't stress",

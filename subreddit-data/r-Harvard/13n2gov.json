    "postText": "Hey guys, I took CS 20 and Math 21b this past semester and they were very challenging for me. Ended up with a B and a B- in the classes. I am planning on doing CS as my concentration but am already struggling with the intro classes. Does anyone have any advice on how I can do better in CS courses at Harvard? Planning to take CS 120 and CS 124 next year and am terrified. How do you usually study for these courses? Any advice would be appreciated!",

Sometimes, it\u2019s really just a time management thing, especially if your high school wasn\u2019t super-competitive and you got away with not having to study all the time \ud83d\ude05\n\nI went to sorta shitty/middle-of-the-road public school and my freshman year, my grades went to shit lol. It really was just learning how to study and manage my time properly with Psets and papers.",

Not a first year, did fairly well on my previous courses, got As on every math class at Harvard except 21b and did better in CS61 and 51 then CS20 \ud83d\ude05. Honestly not sure what happened this semester. I went to a public high school but studied all the time and felt that my time was well managed. How did you change your study habits?",

Plus, it could just be a sign to spend more time in office hours. That way, you have designated time in your schedule to work on things, in addition to whatever additional time you choose to dedicate. \n\nIt\u2019s also entirely possible that, if you were doing well in like CS 61 and 51, that maybe you lost a bit of the wind in your sails and burnt out a bit. Perhaps if you recuperate this summer, you\u2019ll be able to do better next semester?",

I know counting is a bit weird and stuff but if you are struggling with 20 I can't imagine 120 and 124 being a pleasant experience. There's a reason why the CS satisfaction rates from when seniors graduate are so low: it's arguable they should've just studied something else. The good news is that you've done well in 61 so maybe you just need to \"niche down\" into courses similar to that side of CS.\n\nI'll just say if you just want to be a SWE you can do SWE w/o the CS concentration. If you actually like the theory then it's a separate story...",

CS 20 was the first time I saw proofs and theory in my life which is why I thought it was challenging. I am planning to \"niche down\" into courses that are more programming heavy but gotta get through the requirements first. Do you have any advice on how to get through 120 and 124? How can I get a better grasp on proofs?",

But there's this sense that 20 isn't sufficient prep for it. In theory you could look ahead a bit. Not sure if you're interning/doing research this summer; if you are, I wouldn't burn yourself out with doing prep work for classes.\n\nAlso it's been a few years. Do people not do 121 anymore?",

But it seems that 120 is still closer to 121 and 124 from what I have heard, so I think it's still seen as pretty difficult.",

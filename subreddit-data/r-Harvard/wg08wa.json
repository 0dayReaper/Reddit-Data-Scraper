Realistically, no.\n\nNote that you cannot **ever** cross-regiister for 1L courses, so your options are limited to selected courses above first-year, which require approval of both HLS and the Resident Dean. I cannot think of a single instance where the Resident Dean will agree that there is an academic necessity for a first year to take an HLS course.",

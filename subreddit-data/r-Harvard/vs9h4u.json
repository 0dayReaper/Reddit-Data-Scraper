    "postText": "I'm a rising freshman at Harvard hoping to major in Econ. However, I thought it might be a good idea to take a Computer science class such as coding, given how tech is starting to dominate the finance/\nbusiness markets. I've never taken any computer science classes in my life; would taking one at Harvard be too much? Are there any easy CS\nclasses?",

Some think it\u2019s easy, some think it\u2019s hard. it\u2019s a big course so there\u2019s a lot of range in experiences, but there\u2019s also pros to a big course, like being able to access course assistants and office hours easily, and it\u2019s easier to find people to work/struggle with. a lot of people take cs50 that don\u2019t intend to study cs.",

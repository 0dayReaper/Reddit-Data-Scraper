    "postText": "Now that we\u2019re in the middle of punching, recruitment, etc., I just wanted to share a few words about what I think about all of this as a junior at the college, and what I have been talking about with other people here, in hopes of making a lot of you feel better. \n\nMany people right now are posting stuff like \u201cI didn\u2019t get punched, got rejected from an RSO, consulting club, you name it\u201d. Rejection makes you feel terrible, like no one likes you. And that\u2019s a normal human feeling, we all have an inner desire to feel wanted and cared for. \n\nTry to think about all this from a different perspective: a few thousand 18-21-year-old overachievers are going to the same school and sharing the same resources. People who, up until now, were the best of their class, and usually loved that attention. Getting awards and top internships makes you feel so good! People here are addicted to exclusivity. It makes you feel wanted, seen, and desired.\n\nThe late teens and early 20s are also crucial years for our development: first time living on your own, becoming responsible for your own life and future. In high school, life was pretty straightforward, but now you have to choose between tens of concentrations, 400 clubs, and thousands of career fields. \n\nComing into Harvard, all of us had big dreams, and still do. That\u2019s why we got in! But suddenly, we are together with hundreds of other people who are just as cool, so naturally, we start feeling insecure. We start getting anxious about not having the same control and clarity we had in high school. What would make you feel wanted again? Being a member of an exclusive club. Becoming friends with the next multibillion-dollar company founder behind closed doors. \n\nWe all say we go to school near Boston, but I\u2019m quite sure all of you feel pretty damn good about having Harvard on your resume. It\u2019s something a lot of people around the world envy. But inside the institution, that isn't enough anymore to give you the feeling of being memorable and likable. \n\nSo in my opinion, final clubs, a 10% acceptance rate to HCCG, and stuff like this are just products of deep insecurity in young adults trying to navigate the real world for the first time, which is a very natural thing, especially considering the pressurizing Harvard environment. Acknowledging this, my best advice is instead of just anxiously waiting for punch letters and spending hours and hours preparing for a student club's second or third round of interviews, start working on your root insecurities and fear of the future and rejection. It\u2019s going to help you so much more in the long term than being in any club can. This is just the beginning of life, so you will benefit from cultivating a healthier mindset. And those of you who are already in those competitive clubs, I'm not blaming you for contributing to the toxic system, but also recommend thinking about your root motivations. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps some anxious students here, and hopefully we can start working on ourselves to create a more open community with little less insecurity.",

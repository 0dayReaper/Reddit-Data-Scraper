However I am an international student (from Norway) studying in Boston, and before I leave in a few weeks I would really love to try to get a little \u00abinsider\u00bb view of Harvard campuses. Anyone willing to share some tips or show me around? \nPs: I already infiltrated the cafeteria at HBS once, love the library over there!",

Their collections are spectacular and they have several events each week, ranging from lectures to workshops to tours, and even hands-on art making. \n\nAlso, go explore the Natural History museum and attached Peabody Museum. \n\nYou should sign up for a free Harvard Yard tour. It leaves from the Smith Center and you can sign up on Eventbright.",

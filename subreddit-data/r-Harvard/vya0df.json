            "comment": "It\u2019s a fantastic program and I really recommend doing it at some point during your Harvard years! The studio is amazing (probably the best in the area and the most fully fleshed out visual arts offering at Harvard tbh), the instructors are kind and helpful, and the program is heavily heavily discounted for undergrads. I couldn\u2019t recommend it enough if you are interested. But I\u2019m not sure I would do it freshman fall, because the program is mostly grad students or adults from the area rather than undergrads, so you\u2019re losing some social time to meet other undergrads and do other undergrad-specific extracurriculars. Also, if you want to improve quickly at ceramics, you have to go in a couple times a week to practice, and that time adds up (especially given that the studio is in Allston.) Fwiw, I started doing ceramics my second semester junior year with my friends and we all love it and go to the studio together several times a week. Lmk if you have any other questions!",

I\u2019d suggest taking ceramics during the spring after you\u2019ve somewhat adjusted to college but that\u2019s totally up to you!",

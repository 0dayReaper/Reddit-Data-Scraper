Is it the material of the course itself, the professors, another factor? I was interested in taking the course as I am potentially double majoring in econ and stats. Thanks!",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve heard from my friends who took Stat 104 (albeit, this was about 2 years ago with a different professor) that it was one of the most disorganized courses with little to no support. The professor turnover in the course is pretty much every single year so it\u2019s hard to say what it\u2019s going to be like year after year. But I think the turnover is indicative of the fact that there hasn\u2019t really been a consistent professor to teach the course and develop course materials and because of that, every year the professor is virtually starting from scratch so it\u2019s really not their fault at the end of the day.\n\nWhen all else fails when choosing courses: trust the qguide, especially the time commitments that people place on there!",

            "comment": "Stat 104 has been around for many years. For a long time it was a well-liked, useful intro to statistics with an econ focus. Then at some point it got a reputation as being easy (which could be good or bad: some students enjoyed it for being a \"gem\" and some students didn't like it since they thought it was kind of a joke and didn't feel they learned much). It even acquired the nickname \"Frat 104\".\n\nThere were then a couple transitional years, trying to get the difficulty level right: not too difficult but not too superficial either -- statistics is subtle, and it's dangerous to apply methods without understanding their assumptions and limitations! Last year Kevin Rader introduced a revamped version of the course, which I think was much improved over previous years. I expect him to continue to teach the course regularly and that it will be a good class. \n\nAdditionally, a revamped version of Stat 100 was introduced last year by Kelly McConville. She will be teaching Stat 100 regularly going forward, and I think it is a fantastic introduction to statistics with a data science flavor. So that's another option to consider. As prerequisites for other courses, Stat 100 and 104 are viewed as equivalent.",

The problem with the reviews is that the staff turnover was basically once a year, so reading the reviews wouldn\u2019t be relevant for a new staff. the current prof is Kevin Rader who ive had for multiple classes and really like, so also as per joes comments its getting much better. \n\nWill even say that i hated 104 when i took it 2 yrs ago. Honestly was an awful class and the reviews reflected it. But the topics are interesting and useful, so im glad i took it. But it was a severe headache. I believe its different now with a much *different* support structure",

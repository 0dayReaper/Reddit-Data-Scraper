    "postText": "Hello, I will be attending HackHarvard at SOCH. Since I am driving from out of state, I was wondering if there are any cheap parking options in the area (&lt;$20 per day), (&lt;25 mins by walking to SOCH) where I could park my sedan. So far, Alewife Parking Station Garage is a good option but it is a far walk (&gt;35mins) to SOCH. I was wondering if there are any places you guys could recommend me to park at. Thank you.",

I am trying to find one for Cambridge, but that is what I would look for.\n\nEDIT: Try to parking near a park, apparently near there are free parking spot on the street.",

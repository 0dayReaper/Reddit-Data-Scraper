You could alternatively take CS50 or another course via the extension school or Harvard summer school which would allow you to access the campus. I\u2019d suggest asking an advisor from extension/summer school\n\nIf you just want to see the campus a some places on campus are open to public and you can take a tour also regardless of if your taking a course or not",

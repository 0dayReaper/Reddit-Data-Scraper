At most universities, a faculty member is tenure-track as an assistant professor, then they earn tenure and associate professor status at the same time with full professor coming later down the line. Harvard is weird in that only (full) Professors have tenure. \n\nAt Harvard, if a professor is listed as \"Assistant Professor of [Discipline]\" or \"Associate Professor of [Discipline]\" then they aren't tenured. If they are listed as \"Professor of [Discipline]\" or \"[Name] Professor of [Discipline]\", then they are tenured.",

Some universities award tenure to the associate level so you can\u2019t tell by the ranking. If you\u2019re a grad student picking an advisor I\u2019d advise you to be cautious picking someone that is 1-2 years away from their tenure evaluation. They may have to move institutions and if you\u2019re in the sciences you may have to move with them or switch advisors.",

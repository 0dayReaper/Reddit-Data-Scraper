There\u2019s a few star professors that it might be cool to take classes with depending on your interests. \n\nSince I was an international relations/security studies concentrator, I found the classes with Graham Allison and Ash Carter pretty interesting. However, my personal favorite is between Zoe Marks who has a class on Africa and Tarek Masoud who studies the Middle East. \n\nThere\u2019s also a number of leadership and writing courses that are apparently worth their weight in gold. People swear by Ron Heifetz. I didn\u2019t get the chance to take his class, but some have described it as \u201clife-changing.\u201d \n\nPM me if you want any more details!",

    "postText": "Hi all! It's been awhile. This is the unofficial (?) Reddit account for HGSU-UAW Local 5118 - \"the Harvard Graduate Students Union.\" It's very unclear from our name, but our bargaining unit also covers all undergraduate teaching fellows, course assistants, or other undergraduate student workers in instructional roles. Honestly, we should change our name.\n\nYour protections include:\n\n\u2022 An official appointment letter detailing your wage, expected hours, duties, and your administrator contact **before you start working** (Article 3)\n\n\u2022 **Minimum $20.50/hr** this academic year (Article 20)\n\n\u2022 70% pay if your section is cancelled as a teaching fellow (Article 4)\n\n\u2022 Work materials provided **for free** \\- you shouldn't be printing anything for work on your dime! (Article 15)\n\n\u2022 **Paid** sick leave (Article 26)\n\n\u2022 **$30/month bike benefit** if you don't have a discounted MBTA pass (Article 28) -  see [https://www.transportation.harvard.edu/hgsubikebenefit](https://www.transportation.harvard.edu/hgsubikebenefit)\n\n\u2022 Right to a safe and healthy work environment which **also includes mental health and racial justice** concerns (Article 10)\n\n\u2022 **Right to union representatio**n at any meeting you need it - especially any meeting which may lead to disciplinary action\n\nIf you're not seeing these benefits, please file a [workplace issue form](https://harvardgradunion.org/workplace-issue-form/) so we can tackle it together ASAP! If you're bored, you can read the contract [here](https://harvardgradunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Clean-version-of-new-CBA-no-red-lines-1-25-22.pdf). And lastly. if you ever need anything or representation, email us through our [website](https://harvardgradunion.org/)'s contact information. Looking forward to a great semester! &lt;3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Koby, HGSU-UAW President",

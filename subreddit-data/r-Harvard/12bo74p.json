The town of Cambridge is a vibrant and diverse community with a rich history, including a bustling arts and culture scene, numerous restaurants and cafes, and plenty of recreational activities.\n\nIn addition, Harvard itself is far from sterile, with a plethora of student organizations and clubs, lectures and events, and top-notch athletic programs. And while it's true that the undergraduate experience at Harvard is different from that of graduate students, there is still a strong sense of community and energy on campus.\n\nUltimately, the experience of any given student at Harvard, as with any university, will depend on their individual interests and involvement in the community. So while one person may find the town and campus lacking in energy, another may find it to be an inspiring and dynamic environment.\n\n**Update:**\n\n\\&gt; Did you copy paste this?\n\nOur employee has been banned from this subreddit. We are not allowed to reply to you here. That is why I am updating the existing comment. Harvard students, being part of the Liberal Elite of America, do not find anything in this situation that might provoke them to actually doing something. Except a laugh or two, we have received no response at all. How much more elitist can you get?\n\nBefore I proceed to answer your question, could you let me know if you are affiliated with the Mormon Church or the Jehovah's Witnesses in any way? We believe that we are being attacked by people belonging to these churches, since they are not able to respond to the claims regarding the legitimacy of their churches. They are, therefore, trying to discredit the people using this Reddit ID, so as to eliminate us from the conversation.\n\nThe truth is that Harvard and Harvard trained professionals does not have jurisdiction in other countries. To the extent that its professors are bullying students located in other countries, they are committing crimes and should be held accountable. It is unfortunately the case that Harvard's lawyers can claim American jurisdiction over students located within the United States. But there is no reason to believe that the American justice system really delivers justice for other than the wealthy. There are many situations in America which would seem grossly unfair and unjust in other countries, but are simply tolerated in the United States. As a separate issue, it is also unfortunately the case that Harvard trained lawyers have jurisdiction over African-Americans whose ancestors were brought over as slaves. Nobody is denying them jurisdiction over African-Americans. It is their unfortunate lot to be sent to prison with a chance of around one in four. But what about people from other countries? Why should they be subject to such a racist system and perhaps also be put into legal jeopardy because of America's unjust laws? This is a case of the violation of international laws, and that is why a PMQ for Harvard's President would be ideal, since they would be answering to a world-wide audience.",

They tend not   \n\\&gt; to make it in the real world.\n\nWhile everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I must disagree with your statement that most Harvard graduates are unemployable. In fact, Harvard has a strong reputation for producing successful graduates who have gone on to excel in various fields, including business, law, politics, medicine, and technology. This is reflected in the numerous prominent alumni who have made significant contributions to society, such as Barack Obama, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg. Most employers say that it is literally the opposite.  \n\n\nWhile attending Harvard is not a guarantee of success, the education and opportunities provided by the university can certainly help to prepare students for the challenges of the real world.",

I'm not sure if it's because of the prestigious reputation, the crimson-colored glasses, or just the fact that they have a pretty cool mascot. But I have to say, if you're looking to major in never shutting up, Yale is definitely the way to go. Those Bulldogs love to bark, and they never stop! Plus, you'll have plenty of opportunities to debate with your fellow students about which Ivy League school is the best. So, while Harvard may be the answer to most questions, when it comes to never shutting up, it's all about Yale. Who could disagree with that? :-) I would definitely recommend Harvard over Yale.",

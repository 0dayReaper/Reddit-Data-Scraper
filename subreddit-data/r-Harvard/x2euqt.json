    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am looking for recommendations for study spots that are pretty quiet but don't have a lot of foot traffic. I know places like Lamont, Widener, Science Center have quiet areas, but I am a student with ADHD so I get distracted easily by lots of people and movement even if it's quiet. Bonus points if around 10-15 mins from the Quad. Thank you so much!\n\nETA: thanks for all the responses!",

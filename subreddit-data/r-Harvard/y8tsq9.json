    "postText": "I\u2019m at the law school and am completely miserable. Never had any issues in undergrad at a different place at all at all but I\u2019ve found many of my peers to be unkind. And it sucks because the reason I chose HLS over other places with scholarships was I felt the student body was kinder as a whole than my other options. Whenever I say I\u2019m confused, I get shamed. My classmates with lawyer parents emphasize how their parents are resources, how they know big law partners that will give them jobs, and how law school is a cakewalk. \nHaven\u2019t made good friends and I feel like no one wants to even study with me - when I\u2019ve asked, I get shut down. It sucks. People don\u2019t even have time to grab dinner. I was well liked in college so even though it feels like a problem with me, I don\u2019t know if it is? I keep crying and I\u2019m so sad here and I just want to find happiness. Please help - regretting coming to law school here and even debating transferring to a lower ranked school/visiting another school for a year to get out of here if nothing gets better.",

I decided to stick with it for one more year and couldn't be happier I stayed. \n\nI will say, it's not you. I've spoken to other 3Ls and 2Ls and it seems like the general consensus is that  this year's 1L class is more gunnery than most. But you will still find your people! That's one of the benefits of having a huge class. You'll have a lot more freedom as a 2L to meet new people instead of being stuck with the same section every day, and there are a ton of other students who won't shove their privilege down your throat that I hope you'll vibe with more.\n\nFeel free to DM if you want to chat about it more. Hang in there.",

            "comment": "1L is a bitch.  People are short and antisocial because everybody in HLS 1L (and I mean *everybody*) is drowning. The spoiled brats with mommy/daddy connections are just clinging on to those connections like a buoy, because they're also drowning.  \n\nIt gets so much easier though.  The job offers will come.  If not biglaw then bigtech or a startup or non profit or really anything you want.  \n\nSome things that got me through:\n\n1) Social events with people from other graduate programs.  Harvard graduate commons does mixers, fall walks to various preserves, museum visits and more.  \n\n2) Check out beer and dogs on Fridays at the GSD.  Everyone there is drowning too, but the gene pool is totally different from HLS.\n\n3) Take a class at the Kennedy school or HBS during 2L/3L.  Even the divinity school!  Or MIT!  Lots of options to cross register.  Don't feel like you're stuck with your 1L cohort. \n\n4) Sign up for a [class at the ceramics lab](https://ofa.fas.harvard.edu/ceramics/courses).  It's a quiet temple to clay on the other side of the river, tons of busses and shuttles go there, and it will keep you sane.  \n\n5) Take some time every week to go do something in Boston or in the area.  Right now the north shore is -stunning-.  We might be post peak leaf but still.   Rent a zip car, take a walk on Plum Island, or Crane Beach or Halibut Point.  Stop by woodmans of essex for fried clams.  Get some north shore roast beef (I like Glenns).   Take the 72/74 bus to Mt Auburn, visit middlesex fells, or check out the gardner museum...getting distance from the tiny world of HLS is your friend here.",

I am currently doing a Masters in a different graduate school at Harvard. \n\nIn terms of the first year of law school you will find firstly, that law school is ridiculously competitive in the first year at least with everyone sizing each other up. It does get better and ultimately, focusing on your studies can ground you so that you are not so concerned about the apparent confidence or connections of others. Also, really doing the groundwork at 1L pays dividends in later years.   \n\n\nFrom there as others have said try to think about your interests and find groups or clubs that cater to that Harvard has many clubs and joining one of those can help you to find new friends with shared interests to yours.   \n\n\nIf you specifically want law school friends sign up for law school specific extra-curriculars like mooting.   \n\n\nMost of us all do stick in there, at least keep going to 2L when things start to get much better.",

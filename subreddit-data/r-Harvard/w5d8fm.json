    "postText": "CS 182 seems really interesting, and I\u2019d love to take it before I graduate. However, I\u2019m a rising sophomore and would be taking Stat 110 and one of CS 120 or 121 in the same semester. \n\nThe my.harvard page lists Stat 110 under \u201crecommended prep\u201d but says it\u2019s a \u201cmust take\u201d, while the 2020 syllabus doesn\u2019t mention it at all, only saying CS 121/124 should be taken at least concurrently.\n\nNote: I\u2019ve taken AP Stats in high school, though I\u2019m assuming the probability portions of Stat 110 are not at all comparable.\n\nGeneral thoughts on the class? Am I prepared for it? Why are the Q Guide reviews skewed a little low?",

I took 110 and 120 last fall and I wasn\u2019t dying but it wasn\u2019t easy. In my opinion 110 and 120 are much more fundamental than 182, though as a CS/Stats concentrator, I am very biased.",

I\u2019m tempted because the hours aren\u2019t too crazy (compared to other CS classes), but I\u2019m assuming everyone else would have already gone through CS 181? Is there a point to doing both?",

I heard it can be a little hand wavy sometimes.\n\nI believe there is some overlap between the courses, but people take both. CS 181 is basically just a super hard stats class",

    "postText": "I've been seeing so many questions on Reddit, especially from first year students but also from sophomores and above, that I thought it may be useful if I hold an advising session. (I am Joe Blitzstein, a professor in the Statistics Department. I teach Stat 110 and co-direct the Stat concentration.) Of course I'm the most knowledgeable about Stat courses but I also have many years of experience with academic advising more generally, as well as many years of hearing students tell me about their experiences in various math, applied math, CS, and other courses. \n\nI'm announcing this session only on Reddit. It will be next Tuesday 8/16 on Zoom (not on Reddit), starting at 8 pm ET, and running at least until 9 pm (maybe later depending on how many people show up). I haven't tried this before, and may end up alone in a Zoom room, but I get the sense that there are many questions from students, especially with the sad demise of shopping period. \n\nIf you're a Harvard College student, I would love to see you there! I don't want to post the Zoom link publicly, so email me at [blitz@g.harvard.edu](mailto:blitz@g.harvard.edu) at least an hour in advance and I'll send you the link. If you're a Harvard grad student, feel free to email me also and we can figure out if it makes sense for you to attend this session or (if there is enough demand) one for grad students. \n\nFeel free also to drop by to say hi even if you don't have specific questions at the moment!",

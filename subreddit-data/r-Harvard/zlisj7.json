The children's museum and museum of science  are both in Boston. Science museum is similar to the Field museum in Chicago -- dinosaurs, etc.\n\nYou asked specifically on campus, but campus really isn't setup for that but you can make a whole day out of the museums.",

The Cambridge Public Library\u2019s main branch has a wonderful children\u2019s floor and lots of programming.  Look at their website.  Both the playground and library are very close to Harvard\u2019s campus although you\u2019ll be at HBS so just across the river but still close.  \n\nAlso The Coop Bookstore in Harvard Square does story times. \n\nThe 68 bus is a short route between Harvard Square and MIT. Along the way there\u2019s a stop near The Museum of Science.  Although not everything there is tailored to toddlers you can definitely kill some time at the museum.  Further into Boston is a Children\u2019s Museum which is great for that age but that involves the T (subway) or Uber.\n\nIf it\u2019s the spring take the T to the Boston Common and walk over to The Public Gardens for the swan boats.",

Should have child friendly options.",

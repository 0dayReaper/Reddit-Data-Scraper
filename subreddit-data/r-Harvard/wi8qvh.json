Also, I\u2019m a probable STEM concentrator (but I still love the humanities and am considering a joint concentration), so would that negatively impact my application somehow? \nThanks! :)",

However, the class size is now capped at 90 instead of 75, so unless the applications dramatically increase, the acceptance rate should rise.\n\nAlso, not all selected end up enrolling, so if you're waitlisted, you can still get in.\n\n&gt;I\u2019m a probable STEM concentrator (but I still love the humanities and am considering a joint concentration), so would that negatively impact my application somehow?\n\nNo",

At least a few are admitted off the waitlist, usually, too - and if you contact one of the staff/faculty to express your interest, that can increase your chances, there. \n\nAs for your concentration - no, if anything they like having potential science concentrators in the mix!",

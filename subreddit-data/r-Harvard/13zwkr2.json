    "postText": "Hello! Has anyone lived in HUH housing at 5 Cowperthwaite street? If so, could you please share your experience living there?\n\nFor context, I\u2019m going to HBS next year and have the opportunity to live in the Harvard-owned building. I know SFP and OWA are more popular options for HBS students, but 5 Cowperthwaite seems to be pretty nice (close to HBS and Harvard square, has central air, dishwasher, etc.). I appreciate any insight into living there!\n\nAlso, if anyone has any photos of the actual units, that\u2019d be helpful as well! The HUH website just has pictures of the building. \n\nThank you!",

    "postText": "hello, freshman here currently debating spring courses and I was wondering if anyone could give me some honest feedback on the difficulty / usefulness of the following courses (I\u2019m trying to decide which one(s) to take). Currently planning to go for an engineering concentration but also thinking of exploring my interest in astro this term. Any info would be much appreciated!\n\nCS 51: Abstraction and Design in Computation\n\nAM 120: Linear Algebra and Big Data\n\nES 150: Probability with Engineering Applications\n\nASTRO 16: Stellar and Planetary Astronomy\n\nThanks so much in advance!",

I found a Starbucks but the bathroom is out of service. Please help!\n\nUpdate: After trying out some of the options suggested below (much appreciated), I ended up taking an Uber to Himalayan Kitchen restaurant in Somerville. I was supposed to meet a few friends for dinner there at 6 so it worked out.",

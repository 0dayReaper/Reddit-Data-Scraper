Despite the hype about HC being this elite cadre of highly competitive super achievers, it's still also a college full of a lot of shy, young people still trying to figure out who they are like any other college. Yes there are more rich kids who will ask dumb things like \"where do you summer?\" \"Where do you ski?\" But you'll find where you fit in just like you would if you went to Michigan State, LSU or Cal State San Marcos.",

There are plenty of opportunities for you find an age peer group. It may take some extra work outside of your normal class/dining routine. Having your meals in Annenberg isn't conducive to mixing with other \"middle aged\" people. You can definitely find contentment if you seek it.",

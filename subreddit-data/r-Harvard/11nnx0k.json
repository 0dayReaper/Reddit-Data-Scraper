    "postText": "Just bought general admission tickets for Game 2 of the Men\u2019s ECAC Quarterfinal against Princeton. As someone who does not yet attend Harvard, what time should I arrive to get a good seat if the game starts at 7 p.m. on Saturday? Yes, maybe getting there a half hour before won\u2019t be a problem, but my worry is the undergraduates will have almost camped out the good seats.",

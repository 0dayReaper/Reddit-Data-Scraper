My sequence of goals is a bachelors in biomedical engineering or biological chemistry to an ME to an MBA. I know an answer to this question isn't possible without knowing a lot more about me and what I want to do, but I would appreciate any questions or information that I ought to consider to help me make the decision. Thank you!",

I would personally pick Harvard because of the better quality of life\u2026 every MIT student I\u2019ve talked to (granted not many) is overloaded with work. \n\nI don\u2019t think you can go wrong with either school here, the education is top-notch at both schools, but if you\u2019re interested in exploring anything outside of strictly STEM, then I think Harvard is the clear choice. Also if at any point you decide to go down the premed route, Harvard would arguably be the better university for that because of MIT\u2019s tough classes (not to say Harvard classes are easy or anything) and little to no grade inflation. \n\nI hope this helps, and maybe I\u2019ll see you on campus in the fall! :)",

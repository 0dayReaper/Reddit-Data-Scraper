So unfortunately I don\u2019t think the University is likely to be much help. You are probably best off treating this like a regular apartment search - define how far away from campus you are willing to live, select some neighborhoods, set your budget, and then hit up apartments.com or hotpads",

            "comment": "Boston has always sucked for renters. Right now it\u2019s a SHITSHOW. Living on campus is an unbelievable deal both in terms of quality AND affordability. Especially right now. \n\nIf you think the dorms suck or are too expensive you clearly have not lived off campus in Boston. \n\nHere\u2019s what to expect:\n\nyou will spend weeks or months and probably dozens of hours SEARCHING in vain. \n\nLucky enough to find something? You will likely need to pay 4 full months of rent UPFRONT before you even get the keys. \n\nYou will pay an insane amount of money for a crappy apartment. \n\nIf you\u2019re VERY lucky you will have a responsive landlord and your apartment will not have mold, bad neighbors, roaches or mice. However, you should expect AT LEAST one of these. \n\nYou will need to set up gas, electricity and wifi. This takes FOREVER and costs a ton. Be prepared to be furious at how crappy the internet will be for what you pay\n\nHeating: your apartment will always be cold. Despite paying several hundred dollars a month in the winter for heat you will nonetheless need to wear sweaters indoors and will be uncomfortable\n\nMost landlords don\u2019t really care when stuff breaks. If something goes wrong it won\u2019t get fixed remotely quickly. \n\nOh and just for fun? The FBI just issued a warning about rental scams in Boston. \n\nAnyway source? I\u2019ve lived both on campus at Harvard and off campus at Harvard. When I hear people complain about the dorms I\u2019m like \u201cyou think this is bad? TRY SOME OF MY LIVING SITUATIONS\u201d\n\nWhatever you decide GOOD LUCK! I hope you will find a cozy and rad home either way. Just wanted to warn you it\u2019s bleak right now.",

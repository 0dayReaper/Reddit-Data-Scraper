I\u2019m applied math and I\u2019ve finished the foundation sequence (1b,21a,21b) and you\u2019ll be fine. Other classes don\u2019t really pull from 1b that much you\u2019d be better off saving a semester.",

Honestly, you don't need to be THAT good with AP Calc BC to take the 21 series classes and you could still struggle in 1a/1b even if you had taken BC and gotten a 5.\n\nWhy would you take a lower-level class that you don't need when it's just going to be as hard or even harder than 21a?",

I then took a gap year and didn\u2019t take any math again until my sophomore (or maybe even junior?) year, when I finally took 1b. Even being several years removed from Calc BC, Math 1b was a breeze. Granted, all this was over a decade ago.",

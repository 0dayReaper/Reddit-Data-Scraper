This might be a really silly question but it\u2019s stressing me out- do people dress up for these things? Is it business casual?  I feel so out of my element.",

I\u2019m biased because I\u2019ve been at Harvard a long time and that takes the shine off which makes it easier to realize there\u2019s nothing utterly special about Harvard or Harvard alums as such. \n\nPeople that don\u2019t belong act uncomfortable. People that do belong act at home. ACT AT HOME. \n\nWhatever tricks you gotta do to feel at home at that event will help you. Feeling comfortable and confident in your own skin will help you make small talk, approach others, and be curious. \n\nBest professional advice I ever got was to ask 3 questions for every time I offer a statement. Be bold. Just walk up to folks and say hi there I am diligent_magazine, mind if I join you? What were you all discussing? Then ask open ended follow up questions \u201cOh you work at Children\u2019s? Tell me about that.\u201d \n\nTry not to congregate with other \u201cnew students\u201d as y\u2019all will likely stick together. Good luck!",

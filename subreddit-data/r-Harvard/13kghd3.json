But I\u2019m still super excited to get out of my crazy home town for a week or two and get to experience the campus/Boston. Any suggestions for things I should do or try while I\u2019m there? I want the raddest visit possible!",

They're the only ones in the world like them, nobody has any Blaschka flowers except Harvard and nobody has ever been able to create glass flowers as insanely detailed as Leopold and Rudolf. Whatever unique skills they had died with them.\n\nBreakfast at the Harkness Cafe in the Wasserstein law building. Get the Veritas waffle...great social media fodder! You can fill up for like $12 with student discount. (No meal plan required.) The big open room in Wasserstein is a great place to study/rest. Comfortable chairs and there are even phone chargers. Wander around the halls and look at all the portraits while you're in there. \n\nSmith Center. Go up the elevator for student spaces to chill, shoot billiards, ping pong with a beautiful view.\n\nExplore memorial church. It's beautiful. Go in memorial hall. Pop into the Sanders theater. \n\nArt museums. Can't miss.\n\nLook up how to do the Houghton Library tour and absolutely do it.\n\nI'd tell you to grab a pint at the Queen's Head as it's a rite of passage but the chumps close it for the summer! I drink at Grendel's. \n\nDo some homework in the Widener. Have sex in the stacks. \n\nDon't feel embarrassed to take selfies with everything and fangirl/boy/person out. Harvard's a big deal. If it wasn't exciting, what's the point? You only live once. \n\nTry not to feel like an imposter about so-called \"competitive\" admissions. A good chunk of College students are legacy/staff admits or had families with considerable resources that put them in the \"right\" feeder prep schools.\n\n You're making your own opportunity and that should be commended.\n\nYou passed the critical test of reading and writing. You're there honestly and you're paying tuition. You earned the right to wear the crimson.",

            "comment": "If your student ID allows you free entrance to all the Harvard museums, try to check out as many as you can, including those not close to the main campus. The Museum of Comparative Zoology is one of my favorites. Check out the entrance doors to the Biolabs (do you recognize the patterns?), near the rhino statues, and also look at the relief work in the brick circling the top of the building courtyard (end of Divinity Ave., facing east).\n\nAre you a scientist, who knows the names of top chemists and physicists? While looking like a student (backpack) and not a tourist, wander through some of the graduate lab buildings like Mallinckrodt and Lyman and you'll see the lab groups and offices of some of the planet's best scientists, not all of them yet famous (but a surprisingly large number who already are, at least in their fields). The energy in the air is palpable, especially during Nobel season (October-ish).\n\nEspecially if you're East Asian, browse the collection at the Yenching library. For all the libraries, and there are a LOT of them hidden in every building, if they have a Special Collections room that doesn't require a reservation or other special access, browse and see what they have. Especially Houghton (and learn how to pronounce Houghton correctly).\n\nLearn something about Harvard's legacy with regard to slavery and indigenous peoples, and what it's currently planning and actually doing about it. Both locally (slaves having served students and faculty) and globally (repatriation of museum artifacts).\n\nMake friends with students at other colleges and visit their campuses, museums, and libraries when you can, not just the open parties. You'll see what other world-class institutions have by way of resources, and that helps put Harvard's into perspective in a way that guidebooks and websites can't do justice to.",

    "postText": "Hi, I have been admitted into the class of 2027 at my top 2 choices: Brown and Harvard. I am completely torn between the two. I am interested in mostly humanities, economics, and community engagement. I eventually want to serve in some sort of consulting capacity for other black individuals. I was hoping to garner more perspective on Harvard. Pros and Cons? Why did you choose Harvard? Campus life and Atmosphere? Could you explore multiple academic interests? Is it easy to connect with professors? Any opinions you have on ur Harvard experience would be helpful!",

            "comment": "Brown is an excellent school with a unique curriculum. However, the choice is clear: choose Harvard. Its manicured campus is the most beautiful in my experience. Everything is top-rate. If you\u2019re interested in ECON, Harvard and Penn (Wharton or College) are your best bets. The atmosphere is perfectly suited for study and broadening your horizons. As an alumnus/a, rare opportunities will be opened to you. Recruiters from top consulting firms flock to Harvard\u2014and other top-tier universities. \n\nI completed my undergrad at another Ivy, and I wouldn\u2019t trade it for another BA, including Harvard\u2019s AB. My graduate experience at Harvard was academically challenging to say the least. (I had intentionally chosen a concentration outside my academic comfort zone.) Naturally, there are things about every university to which one could object. \n\nIf you have the opportunity to attend Harvard, and you\u2019re interested in what you stated above, accept it!",

            "comment": "An economics degree at Harvard is worth a LOT. Pretty sure it's the #1 economics department in the world.  I would highly recommend checking out Harvard Black Consulting (their Instagram is harvardblackconsulting). The students will have a lot to tell you, not just about the black experience in the Econ department, but also about the field of consulting you want to get into! In my experience of one (1) econ class, the economics department is great and a number of professors bring their dogs to their offices.\n\nThis might be a bit of a hot take, but as a black pre-med STEM girlie \u2014 the atmosphere at Harvard is what you make it. A lot of people here talk about extreme competitiveness, a culture that glorifies stress, etc, but I honestly have been able to avoid that pretty well. It exists for sure, but I choose who I surround myself with pretty carefully. There is enough diversity of personality here that you can definitely minimize your interactions with the toxic crowd!\n\nThe vast majority of professors are very nice and love students! Many of them force us to call them by first name, lol.\n\nHarvard also offers secondaries so you can even get a \"minor\" in a totally different field. Even then, to meet all your graduation requirements, you will kind of be forced to explore other interests which is fun! Also, first-years are required to take a class called Expos to develop writing skills, but we are offered a wide range of class topics that we can lottery for. Mine was about family and ancestry, and I loved it.\n\nOne more thing, a lot of people who get into consulting aren't even Econ majors!\n\nWould probably be best to talk to a Brown student as well (if you haven't already) just because any relatively happy student will be pretty biased towards their school, so other perspectives would be great to have. :) Congratulations on two awesome acceptances!",

I understand that making a decision between these two prestigious institutions can be difficult, and I'm more than happy to provide some insights on my experience at Harvard.  \nPros and Cons:  \nPros:  \nRigorous academics: Harvard offers a top-notch education in humanities, economics, and community engagement. The curriculum is challenging but rewarding, and the resources available to students are unparalleled.\n\n  \nPrestigious reputation: A degree from Harvard carries significant weight, which can be beneficial when seeking internships, job opportunities, and networking in your future career.  \nDiverse community: Harvard has a diverse and global student body, which can lead to exciting conversations and experiences both in and out of the classroom.\n\n  \nOpportunities for research and collaboration: There are ample research opportunities and chances to work with esteemed faculty members, particularly in the areas of your interest.\n\n  \nStrong alumni network: The Harvard alumni network is extensive, which can be beneficial for your future career aspirations.  \nCons:  \nCompetitive atmosphere: The academic environment at Harvard can be quite competitive, and you may find it more challenging to establish close connections with your peers.\n\n  \nLarger class sizes: Some of the introductory courses can have larger class sizes, which can make it difficult to connect with professors initially.\n\n  \nLess curricular flexibility: While Harvard does offer a variety of courses, Brown's open curriculum allows for greater exploration and flexibility in course selection.\n\n  \nCampus Life and Atmosphere:  \nHarvard has a vibrant campus life with numerous clubs, organizations, and events. There is always something happening on campus, and students have numerous opportunities to engage in extracurricular activities. However, the atmosphere can be quite competitive, which may affect your experience depending on your personal preferences.  \nExploring Multiple Academic Interests:  \nAt Harvard, you can certainly explore multiple academic interests. While you will need to fulfill specific requirements for your major, there are many elective courses available, and you can also pursue a secondary field or even a joint concentration.  \nConnecting with Professors:  \nConnecting with professors can be challenging in larger classes, but it becomes easier in smaller, more advanced courses. Attending office hours, engaging in class discussions, and seeking research opportunities are all ways to establish meaningful connections with your professors.  \nMy Harvard Experience:  \nOverall, I had a positive experience at Harvard. The academics were rigorous, and the opportunities for growth and development were abundant. The atmosphere can be competitive, but I found that it pushed me to excel and achieve my goals. Connecting with professors took some effort, but the relationships I formed proved to be incredibly valuable.  \nI hope this information helps you in making your decision. Remember that both Brown and Harvard are excellent institutions, and you should consider your personal preferences and priorities when choosing between them. If you have any further questions or would like more information, please feel free to reach out.  \nBest of luck with your decision, and congratulations once again on your acceptance!",

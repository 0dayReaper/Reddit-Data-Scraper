    "postText": "Hey guys!\n\nI am planning to buy some apple products before the school year starts. If I would like to utilize the technology reimbursement form, do I have to wait until the academic year officially begins? Or, can I apply for it now, in the summer? I plan on getting an iPad pro btw. :)\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "A conservative voice can fit in well at Harvard. And is a place for learning and a lot of professors / classmates will accept and listen to your opinion. If you define yourself as a conservative and only as a conservative I would suggest not coming here, the same suggestion I would make if someone considered themselves a liberal and only a liberal.\n\nHarvard is a place to learn not just from your professors but from the people you disagree with. Is it a place to grow as a person, and more importantly as a human being. If you are not capable of having a conversation where politics doesn't come up, accepting that you can be wrong, or building people up through debate, I would suggest considering other places. \n\nMany conservative voices find themselves here on campus. It may be a smaller coalition then fellow Harvardites on the left, but they are certainly present and active.\n\nConsider for a second, if this is the deciding factor for your schooling, are you willing to let your politics get in the way of becoming friends with interesting people or having an education that is unmatched on many levels?\n\nI've worked in politics long enough to know one thing, it's not worth a damn. Give it up and start learning how to make your friends and your neighbors the best that they can be and you'll find out that maybe you've gotten better yourself.",

I found that the voices were a bit too extreme for me, and just kept my mouth shut in certain communities and found it rather eye opening. I\u2019d consider myself much more moderate now than I used to be, and if libertarians weren\u2019t fucking morons that\u2019s probably where I\u2019d find myself. Its certainly not \u201cindoctrination\u201d that you hear about, but you should certainly come with an open mind, and be wary that certain comments or opinions could face backlash from your peers depending on your views",

There are some conservative spaces at the College, mostly on the dl, but you\u2019d certainly feel on the margins, I expect. If you\u2019re easy-going about your views, then it shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue making friends. First year will be particularly difficult, but you\u2019ll meet more like-minded students after that. In classes, you might have to feel like you\u2019re managing your speech, but that\u2019d be the case at any top school. If you want to be around other conservative students in a big way, you\u2019ll have to apply to one of those sorts of schools.",

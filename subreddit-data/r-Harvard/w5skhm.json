            "comment": "PHIL 159 (i.e. Epistemology) has been one of my highlights at Harvard so far. Wonderfully taught and covers a huge amount of super important material (somehow it manages to make even stuff like the basics of modal metaphysics relatively easily digestible).\n\nAlso, PHIL 14 is a great intro ethics class\u2014covers lots of different topics and gives a good foundation for philosophical writing. Really useful and hugely important!\n\nNeither classes are easy (particularly epistemology isn\u2019t). But they are really worth the time and effort!",

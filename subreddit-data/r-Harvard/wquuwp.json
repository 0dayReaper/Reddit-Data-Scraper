    "postText": "Hey, I'm a frEsHmAn\" and I plan to take the following:\n\nMATH 55\n\nCS 121 \n\nPhysics 16 \n\nCS 165\n\nI added up the median hrs/week on the q-guide and it's 64 hours per week. Is this manageable and will I have time to go party at least 3x a week? \n\n**On a more serious note,** most of your schedules are fine. A schedule of CS50 (some might opt for 61 if advanced with prior coding experience), a math course, an ECON/GOV/LIFE SCIENCES course, and EXPOS/SEMINAR/LANGUAGE) is honestly fine for a prospective STEM student. \n\nIn other words, 2 pset-heavy + 1 medium pset-course + 1 humanities/gened is a bit above average (mostly compared to non-STEM students) but completely manageable if you don't leave everything at the last minute. \n\nIf you guys want **serious advice**, you should ask about specific courses. Just posting your course schedule won't do anything for you lmao. The upperclassmen/alumni on here are willing to give advice, but you need to seek it out (if you really want it) rather than just making generic posts.\n\nAnyways, see y'all freshmen in a week! Maybe some of you will be in my lab for CS50. Come to my OH and tutorials though!",

CS50 could be 5 hrs/week if you have some programming experience, but could be 20 hrs/week if you are completely new. A STEM major might want to budget ~20 hours per essay in a humanities gened, whereas a humanities major would be able to knock that essay out in a night.",

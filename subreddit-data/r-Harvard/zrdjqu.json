    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nI'm moving to Cambridge/Boston as a postdoc in a few months (April). I was approved for Harvard Housing and ideally would like to live in Soldiers Field or one of the nearby residences. However, there are basically **no** properties coming up on the availabilities page.. And the ones that do come up have a lease start date for a week or so in advance, and even then are snatched up within a few hours... I was wondering if this is normal, and if I'm basically out of luck, or if I should continue to keep an eye out? Any advice, input would be appreciated.   \n\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Housing in Boston is a total shitshow. HUH stuff usually goes well in advance. Best advice? 1. Check about subleasing through HUH. Might have luck there 2. Wherever you are coming from expect to pay more and get less to move here. Right now the limiting factor is availability. If you find something that is not a scam, you can swing rent-rise, and it\u2019s physically safe? SNATCH IT UP. Sounds like you\u2019re coming here off cycle (most leases are Sep to Sep) which means if you are very dutiful in your search you might get lucky but overall availability will be low since most of Boston is on September to September leases. \n\nOh, and the fun part is usually move in requires 3-4 months up front: first last and security but then also the broker fee. \n\nMost everyone I know was shocked\u2014even those from NYC and places like Geneva Switzerland\u2014 at how challenging renting is here and how little one gets. \n\nI say all this because don\u2019t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. \n\nGOOD LUCK",

            "comment": "Hi there! I moved here last March and had the same issue. I had never been to Boston so I had to get a realtor/broker because I didn\u2019t know the neighborhoods and knew they got first pick of when places got listed. My advice would be to get one!! Here are the big things I learned:\n\n1. You will likely need 4x your monthly rent to move in. Sometimes you\u2019ll only need 3, and in very rare cases 2, but a lot of times listed places require first months rent, last months rent, a security deposit, and a brokers fee, all equal to the rent cost. \n\n2. Places go FAST. This is why a broker helps. I spent 3 weeks looking and applying at places before I finally got to my wits end and applied to my current place 2 minutes after it was listed. I moved in 4 days later.\n\n3. Because of this, places can be listed a week away from their move in date, just because they will reliably be rented out. \n\n4. MAKE NOTE OF THE HOUSING TYPE. I got very lucky in that regard, but a lot of housing in Boston/Cambridge is a nightmare to move in/out of. 4th floor walk ups, no elevator, tiny spiraling staircases that you can\u2019t fit a queen size mattress up. \n\n5. It\u2019s cold now, and Boston knows how to do cold. But don\u2019t forget about the summer!!! A lot of places in Boston don\u2019t have air conditioning. It\u2019s not a big deal if you have a window AC unit, or a north facing apartment. But it was something I didn\u2019t anticipate moving here from the south. My apartment is south facing and I don\u2019t have AC so in the summer I use blackout curtains and a bunch of fans to help cool off. Not a major thing, but something I didn\u2019t know moving here!\n\n6. If you have a car, it will need to be registered in Massachusetts THE DAY you move in. There is no grace period! Parking in Boston is a nightmare so you\u2019ll need to register your vehicle, change your residency status, and get a parking permit for your neighborhood. I managed to buy myself a little time by slapping a handwritten sign on my car that explained I had just moved and was getting all that paperwork done still. Only one cop gave me a ticket! There is also street cleaning that happens every other week, so make sure you read the street signs so you don\u2019t get towed. It\u2019s a $250 towing charge plus a $90 ticket if it happens so it\u2019s best to avoid it.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions at all don\u2019t hesitate to reach out. I can send you my realtors #, he was amazing and I recommend him to everyone I can. I had a lot of help from this sub and the r/Boston sub despite their prickly reputation :)",

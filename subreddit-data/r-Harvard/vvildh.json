    "postText": "I was thinking about taking:\n- Expos or an Ethics &amp; Civics Gen Ed (depending on when I get assigned expos)\n- Spanish (probably 40) \n- Econ 10A\n- WOMGEN 1217: Psychology of the Gendered Body with Professor Nicole Noll\n\nIs it a bad idea for me to take the WGS course\u2014should I opt for a Gen Ed instead? And is it likely I would even get into the class, or is some kind of priority given to WGS concentrators/upperclassmen? I do have a genuine interest in the class, and it looks really, really interesting (frankly, I would be most excited for this course out of everything I listed), but I don\u2019t want to make my life complete hell, either.\n\nI would also appreciate any general thoughts about my schedule, or advice about the classes I listed + their professors! Thanks so much\u2014you\u2019ve all been so helpful! :)\n\nInfo for context: AP Spanish 5, considering Social Studies concentration",

There are 4 tests on Canvas (Preubas) which are kinda annoying to do but are cake if you pay attention in class and look over your worksheets (I never really studied beyond this). There are 4 essays you do (Composiciones) which don't take long to do and are fairly straightforward assignments. The movies are the only thing to make sure you block out time to actually watch them. There is a final project which is just making your own short film (\\~10 mins) based off of one of the movies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Spanish 40 is great and very chill, I will always hype it up. Try to get Wilnomy as your TF if you can, but all the staff are great.",

It may take you a little bit to get used to the rhythm of the class and your grade may suffer a little (wouldn\u2019t be worse than a B+ though). Have a couple of backups ready if the WGS class has a low class size limit or very popular. Did you check the Qguide for the WGS course? It should give you an idea about how much work it would require.",

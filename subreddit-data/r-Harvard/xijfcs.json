A great place.\n\nGSD has a place to eat called Chauhaus which is nice as well.\n\nDudley House has Cafe Gato Rojo.\n\nThe Science Center has a cafeteria area with pretty good pizza, imho.\n\nThere used to be a super cheap and yummy food truck in the alley behind William James Hall (tallest building on campus).\n\nThere\u2019s a nice cafe at CGIS (the two buildings for gov students).\n\nSanders Hall I thought had a cafe in the basement.\n\nYou could also go to the Smith Center or to Clover in Harvard Square.\n\nBone Apple Tea!",

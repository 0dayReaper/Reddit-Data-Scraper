    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm an incoming freshman at Harvard, and I am planning on attending Visitas next month. I had a few questions about the event and how to make the most out of the experience. It'd also be super helpful to get some advice from someone who will be hosting at Visitas. \n\n1. Will I be with my host the entire time?\n2. How are host placements decided?\n3. Will my experience at Visitas be dependent on the quality of my host?\n4. Which dorms do they usually place students in? Underclassmen, upperclassmen? Specific houses?\n5. Will there be opportunities to meet other freshmen? If so, how should I socialize with them (as someone who is more introverted)?\n6. There was a form that I had to fill out to register and there was a space to write additional information, does it make a difference if I request a student with a specific concentration or sports activity involvement?\n7. Any other tips/ advice you wish you had known in hindsight?\n\nThank you :)",

            "comment": "So popping over here from your other post about first year dorms...\n\n1. No, it's exam season when you visit so generally hosts expect you to be independent. YMMV\n\n2. Mostly random \n\n3. No, Visitas is what you make of it. Some people liked it, some people didn't. You'll get a schedule with tons of activities and things to do and your host will not go to any of it with you lol.\n\n4. It's random unless, unless you have a friend on campus and request to room with them. I notice it's majority first years that host students, so you're likely to stay in a freshman dorm, but many upperclassman host too. The clubs were in get a table at the activities fair if we host students, so students of all years are incentivized to host.\n\n5. Yes of course!! But don't expect to meet your BFF for life here either.\n\n6. Probably not, that section might be for allergens, disability accomodations, etc. \n\n7. My guy, just chill a bit. Visitas is not a test, you already got in. You don't need to prove yourself even more. Enjoy the weekend, go to events or activities you find interesting, and try your best not to compare yourself to others. Everyone's got a killer resume coming in, so try not to let imposter syndrome set in. I know it did for me.\n\nYou seem a tad anxious about Harvard based on this post and your previous post, so shoot me a message if you want to chat. I've had an overall great experience here and would be happy to answer any questions you've got.",

Definitely confirm with your host whether you need to bring a blanket, sleeping bag, anything like that. My host had a futon and blanket, so I didn't need to pack blankets or anything.",

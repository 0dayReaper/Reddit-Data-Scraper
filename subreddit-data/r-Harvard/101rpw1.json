    "postText": "Hi everyone. I'm a junior at the college with a double concentration in a humanities field and math. I'm from a fairly low-income background, but I have a lot of moral compunctions about most of the careers Harvard funnels its undergrads into, so I've become anxious as of late about my financial future. I think I have the kind of resume that would be good for grad school in the humanities (high gpa, fluency in a few other languages, research experience in the humanities). I'll probably go to grad school  a few years after I graduate, but I don't know what would make sense in the interim. Ideally speaking, I would like a well-paying remote job so I could move around every few months, but I feel like most of those jobs are in tech and I'm not sure if there's a place for me there. I wouldn't mind going into a math-heavy career, but I don't know if my background would be suited for it since I haven't done any quantitative extracurriculars or internships in my time at Harvard. And while I'm keeping the major since I'm practically done with all my requirements, I haven't taken any math  classes in the last year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I mean to say is that I feel like I might have cornered myself into a pretty bad professional situation. I've expressed some of these worries to my professors and they've reminded me that I will at least graduate with a Harvard BA, so the situation can't be that bad, but I'm not sure what that means practically. I don't know many upperclassmen at Harvard (Covid's a bitch), and I know none at all who have done something other than IB/quant/consulting, professional school, or tech, the former two of which are not appealing and the latter of which doesn't seem within reach to me. Anyway, I'd really appreciate some advice here. Thanks!",

Plenty of my humanities friends ended up in those jobs. I like the suggestion about reaching out to the career center, I would also recommend looking up profiles of alums on LinkedIn with similar backgrounds with interesting jobs and reaching out - some may not respond, but many will be willing to offer some advice/ guidance.",

The process starts with taking an inventory of your interests and skills, and exploring different career options. I've found it very helpful. I've learned about jobs I didn't even know existed and setup something of a roadmap to become competitive for the jobs that interest me. I'm also very hard line about not working for Satan Corp and they've accommodated that.",

You can start as a copywriter with a small portfolio (literally make a portfolio for the job you want) and your degree - and receive very good compensation. AngelList is a good place to get an idea of who hires for what, and GlassDoor is a good window into the culture.\n\np.s. A good friend is a poet who took her humanities degree into a copywriting job and retired early after a fortuitous IPO. If you're at all good at pattern-matching, it's not out of line to say this kind of success is possible. Best of luck!",

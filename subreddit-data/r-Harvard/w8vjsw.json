Go talk with your professors, talk with your TFs. Maybe especially the TFs\u2014there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019re sitting in their office during their OH\u2019s and nobody comes, especially if its not the week before a deadline.\n\nBring questions and thoughts about the course material, ask for advice on related future studies, ask them questions about their own other work and research - you\u2019ll learn a lot, and the instructors will appreciate that you come by, as well.",

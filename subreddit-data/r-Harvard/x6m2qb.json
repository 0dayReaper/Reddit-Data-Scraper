    "postText": "whatever you do, do not get the \"roxy's grilled cheese\" at the athletic kickoff food truck. you may think i'm joking, but this menu item is not for the faint of heart. don't get me wrong, the sandwich was a masterwork, dare i say, straight gas. however, the aftermath of said sandwich was also straight gas. i will go on record to say that i am not lactose intolerant, but this little cheese sandwich made me acquire the formerly mentioned disorder within a total of no more than thirty minutes. my stomach was downright churning as i ran, while also furiously holding in my guts, back to my dorm. the only person i feel more sympathetic for than myself is my toilet bowl. this experience has led me to believe that the \"rest\" room is certainly a misnomer. you have been warned",

I could understand if it was the bbq pork or stuff, but people have said it about their plain grilled cheese which would point towards the butter or something. Caveat emptor",

I know it's obviously the hardest course a freshman can take and I am considering it but scared I wont be on the level needed to keep up. Also wondering if anyone can give opinion on physics 15 vs physics 19? Both seem interesting but idk which is best especially cause I plan on going to grad school. Any helpful info is appreciated. Thank you! :)",

Don't simply fall into the hubris trap that you must take the honors version. 15a is a perfectly fine course that prepares you for further physics classes, and many physics concentrators take it. 16 covers mechanics in more depth and breadth and is somewhat more time consuming.",

I don't know the new guy, so the experience may be different.\n\nThe course was manageable, and light years beyond AP Physics C. But late nights the night before Psets were due were common. But Georgi incentivized you to work on them together and was almost always there with you that night. \n\nDavid Morin, who teaches 15a, is supposed to be a solid instructor, but I never had a class with him.\n\nLike I said, it's easy, and acceptable, to drop down to 15a if 16 is too challenging, do you have nothing to lose by trying if you think you might be interested.",

            "comment": "I took Physics 19 as a non-major. 19 is a broader survey which will give you a tour of many of the different areas of physics, with some discussion of philosophy of physics as well. This makes it a course especially popular among non-majors, but many people also take it as an intro to the major. Barandes is absolutely outstanding and will take the time to get to know you if you come to his office hours. (If you're from a background underrepresented in physics, he will be an especially good friend to make - he cares a lot about inclusivity.) 15a might leave you a bit more prepared on mechanics and SR specifically (and might be marginally more effort) but either is a fine intro to the major. Good luck!",

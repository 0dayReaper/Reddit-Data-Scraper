Aside from the fact that the question is moot until you are accepted, a student aspiring to Harvard(or Yale, tec) should be able to research in their own.",

I cant tell if your trying to be smartaleky or actually help, but ima say your actually trying to help. If so, i already emailed all these schools/looked at the faq page/ looked at the GenEd requirements page. So yes, I do know how to research for myself. Going on reddit and asking is the 4th choice thing I've done, hopefully to get some genuine answers from students that may possibly attend the school and be in my situation (disliking math/sci). So yes ive spammed the question, but dont reply in a smartass typa way, i mean i still assume your trying to help!",

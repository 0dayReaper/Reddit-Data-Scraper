    "postText": "Not a Harvard student, but I was wondering how difficult it is to get classes at Harvard. At the college I'm currently going to, getting classes is a difficult experience, and waitlists are the norm for most GE and degree-specific classes. Is this a universal experience for all colleges, including Harvard?",

You may not get the desired time for the discussion section, but it's rare not to get into a course that you're qualified for.",

But even those courses that I wanted that were listed as lottery courses either never reached the course limit, or the course limit was raised. The only course that I was unable to get into was a TDM course that was filled by concentrators, which is understandable. Your experience was obviously different.\n\nAnd again, this is better than many other colleges where students have trouble getting into courses required for their major. Not getting into Science of Cooking when there are plenty of other gen eds is not exactly the end of the world.",

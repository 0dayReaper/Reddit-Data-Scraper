Allegedly the alumni received an e-mail about it.\n\nDoes anyone have further details of how that would play out? When the merge would kick in, what the new curriculum would look like, how many seats it would have, etc.\n\nThanks in advance!",

If such a merger could be achieved, all graduates of the expanded program would demonstrate their competency in key domains that are generally important for policymakers and public leaders and also could demonstrate their achievements in specific areas if they wanted to do so.\n\nOf course, such a change would involve many complexities that would need to be worked through in advance. We have no final plans and no fixed timetable for making final plans. Instead, we will be engaging with faculty, students, staff, and alumni to be sure that everyone\u2019s perspective is heard and brought to bear.",

            "comment": "There are no details yet but ending the MPA program is a decision already made by the dean. He made the decision behind closed doors, but it leaked, some people from the school government found out and last semester students started demanding to be adequately informed about the decision process. So far, the idea of the dean is to merge the two programs to force everyone to have a core (the cores at HKS are VERY shitty) to mitigate \"signaling issues\" with employers (not that he has shown any formal complaint of anyone). There's no further information yet, but I would think that they would increase the number of seats at the MPP (they are not going to lose that revenue), and it would kick in perhaps in 3-5 years, although there is not a clear plan yet and some town halls are going to take place soon.",

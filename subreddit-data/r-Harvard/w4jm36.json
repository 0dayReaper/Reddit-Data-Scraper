If so, do you have any recommending ways to try to win a 'spot'? Wanna dive into research but first time going overseas (COVID), so not sure how to handle...Thank you all for your help and see u at campus!",

I did that and can tell you from my experience that I should have listened to another professor of mine who advised to be very careful in choosing a lab\u2014some of them are great with grad students, some with postdocs, neither of which *guarantee* that they are also great at teaching undergrads. It\u2019s much more important to choose a place with a nice and not-too-cutthroat environment (especially in the beginning). The competition to get a lab at Harvard-affiliated places is brutal which guarantees that their research quality is great on average\u2014no reason to put yourself through a potentially toxic lab experience for the sake of a world-famous professor if you can help it (and you certainly can!).\n\nAs a matter of fact, I\u2019d recommend you to wait until you are on campus, and able to ask advice from concentration advisors and other professors. They tend to have mystically good \u201chunches\u201d when it comes to recognizing good and bad labs/research groups.\n\nSometimes the smaller places with less people are much better for undergrads as you are able to get more individual attention (which is often close to non-existent in 40- to 50-people-sized groups).",

            "comment": "working with a renowned professor means jack shit if you don't learn anything. if you're an undergrad in a big research group, chances are you're not going to get any attention and your work will be the menial labor the grad students don't want to do. entering \"famous\" labs might be easier than you expect because they typically have the resources to accommodate a part-time research assistant, but working on ground-breaking research may not be on the table\n\n\"but what does that matter if i get a paper with Prof. XXX's name on it\" - it will make a huge difference in interviews about your skills, your contributions, etc. \n\nTake the advice from u/Vivacissimo000 - and when you narrow down lab interests, see if they can put you in contact w/ undergrads who have previously worked or currently work in the lab. ask them about what they did, what they feel like they contributed, etc.",

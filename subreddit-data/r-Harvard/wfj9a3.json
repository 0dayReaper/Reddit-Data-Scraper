Also -- is it disqualifying if you have not taken a course but are a grad student with background in the course topics?",

The bigger thing is that  Harvard PhD students with funding are usually prioritized for those positions, so it would just depend on how many positions are still available after that.\n\nI would just reach out to your grad program coordinator and tell them you\u2019re interested - they\u2019ll let you know what\u2019s possible. Some depts have an application process, others it\u2019s more informal, so it would just depend.",

At some point in August an email went out advertising courses that were looking for TFs as well as an email to contact about the opportunity, so I just reached out, had a brief meeting with the professor to confirm I'd be a good fit, and that was that. I don't think the position/email was specific to my department as the email was one of the all-grad-student lists. So definitely keep an eye on your inbox.",

Then talk to a professor and express your interest. It varies by department. It's very common in Math, Physics and CS.",

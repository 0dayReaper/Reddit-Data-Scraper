    "postText": "i\u2019m planning to go to visitas with my parents &amp; little bro (they really really wanna come with to visit campus &amp; see boston and whatnot) but i was wondering if there would be anything for them to do?? i know most of the activities are planned for students but would they at least be allowed to go on the tour? i wasn\u2019t sure if it\u2019d be awkward or anything. \n\ni know there\u2019s some informational stuff for parents but mine are immigrants who don\u2019t speak very good english so they prolly won\u2019t be able to understand most of workshops and panels and stuff anyways. \n\nalso, it seems like a shared sentiment that visitas isn\u2019t super representative of day-to-day at harvard, so i\u2019m also wondering if maybe i should just take a personal visit with my family? again, they\u2019re immigrant parents who are genuinely super stoked about me being admitted and want to experience my first visit with me really bad\u2026 but i\u2019m not sure if visitas is the best weekend to do that.",

            "comment": "If you go to Visitas, go by yourself. The intended experience is to be just incoming students with current students to get a feel for how it is to live here without having to cater to your parents. They will get much more out of coming for move-in and freshman parents weekend in the fall.",

            "comment": "Im pretty sure you can possibly do a tour with them early on and then split for visitas weekend. I remember reading that there are very limited options for parental programming and we'll all be back for move-in day anyways. My dad wanted to come but like I explained that hey we'll check it out together on move in day(so we don't waste extra room and flight cost,) Congrats on Harvard tho!",

            "comment": "Definitely don't bring them. You stay with a current student (or at least that's how it was 10 years ago) and all the programming is centered around students. It will be awkward if they are there, and you will miss out on bonding with other students which is one of the biggest benefits. Many parents come to move in week and freshman parents weekend (in November). My family was lower income so they just wanted to pick one visit because of travel costs. They chose freshman weekend and it was a great choice - lots of programming like tours and performances designed exactly for family members. They loved it.",

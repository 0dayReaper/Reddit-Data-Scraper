Places like Darwin's are what they are, but you won't remember the food afterwards; it's about as memorable as IHOP (and often worse) at x3 the cost.\n\nA lot of the food is just broken around here where the high rents haven't translated into expensive yet amazing *quality* or expensive yet amazing *value* since food costs aren't usually the biggest factor. Darwin's has no reason to charge $3 for a plain piece of toast lol",

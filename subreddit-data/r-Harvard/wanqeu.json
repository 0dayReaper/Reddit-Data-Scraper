We had a top floor room with a great view of the yard. They say VIPs' kids are often placed in Grays to make security easier (or something) and I did know a couple who lived there. There are classrooms in the basement and we snuck 30 racks of beer down there once on a weekend night to have a pong tournament. Also, I am not recommending this, but the rooftops are, or at least were, fully accessible from the top floor windows. A couple of people got suspended for bringing chairs up there, so again \u2014 NOT a recommendation.",

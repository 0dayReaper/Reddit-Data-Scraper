Cocker Spaniels are effectively American versions of English dogs, much like how Harvard has followed the model of British collegiate universities for the most part. Also very few schools (if any) have Spaniels as a mascot. There are also spaniels with dark red hair which reflects Crimson being the color of the school. The teams can be called the Crimson, and the mascot can be \"Johnny the Spaniel\" or whatever name you choose. \"Charles the Spaniel\" could be an alternative name, or \"Ann\" (for Radcliffe).",

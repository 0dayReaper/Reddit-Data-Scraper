    "postText": "Hi, I'm a graduate student at Harvard and want to live in one of the 4 GSAS dorms. I applied through the housing portal but got wait-listed and never heard back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was wondering if there is anyone currently living in one of the GSAS residence halls and wants to move out, if so we can coordinate something and I'll be happy to take your place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor reference, I live in Somerville and find the 30 minute commute to and from campus really tiring.",

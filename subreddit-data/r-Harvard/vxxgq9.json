Where are the shitposts?\n\nI was interested in applying to Harvard Law, but I'm afraid that my personality may be a bit too vivacious. What do you guys do for fun? Do you touch grass? I can't remember the last time I felt the earth tickle my feet... Too busy lurking on Brazzers and managing my mom's OF (you may also find her on Brazzers)\n\nLive a little, you silly little goosies \ud83e\udd2a Crack a joke, talk about something other than what you'll do with your parents' inheritances, and for Gosh sakes, lose your virginity already!\n\nSincerely,\n\nA Cornell undergrad",

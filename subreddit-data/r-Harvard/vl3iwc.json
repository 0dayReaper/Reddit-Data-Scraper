    "postText": "Hey everyone I\u2019m trying to plan out my sophomore year and currently I\u2019m thinking of doing CS 120, Stat 110, and CS 109a as my only classes for the fall and then CS 109b, Math 21b, a GENED, and a gov class sophomore spring.\n\nWould this be a reasonable schedule to take? And is CS 109 generally a good class? Is linear algebra a strict requirement for the class?",

            "comment": "Took 110/120 last fall, both highly recommended classes (I may be a TF for both) but it\u2019s a good amount of work. I was certainly quite busy, but not my worst semester (I took CS 181 and stat 111 at the same time which was significantly more work). Adding 109a will be a big courseload and I\u2019ve heard people don\u2019t like the class as much, but that it is pretty useful. Maybe take a gov class this fall instead of 109a and see if you still want 109a next year? I know people (including myself) that like data science/ML who skipped the 109 route, but I also have a friend who\u2019s going to be a data scientist who followed it. Either way Stat 110 and CS 120 are certainly more fundamental imo",

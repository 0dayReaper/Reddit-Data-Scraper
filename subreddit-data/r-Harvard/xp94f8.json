I think there was a building security problem in that there was a building exit that people could come into, avoiding the check-in desk, and the rear stairs went straight into the locker room. I don't know if any of that has been corrected.\n\nI had the cheapest kind of Masters combo lock that was easy to break open, a better lock (that also looked strong) might have been enough of a deterrent    to avoid the theft. I assume they had to work quickly while the locker room was vacant.\n\nHemenway doesn't have this kind of building layout problem.",

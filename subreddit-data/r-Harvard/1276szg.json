The math department is fantastic and extremely supportive and flexible to whatever path you want to take. That being said, the econ department doesn\u2019t allow joint concentrations (I believe, I\u2019d double check if I were you) so you\u2019d be stuck doing a double which can be a lot, or doing applied math with the econ track, or something of the sort",

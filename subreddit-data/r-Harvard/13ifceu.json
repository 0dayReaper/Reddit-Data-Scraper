    "postText": "I'm hoping to take STAT 100 as my only math course this fall, as this is highly relevant to what I want to study. However, I read in the course catalog that we have to take a math department class(MATH 21, 22, etc), and if we would like to take a stats class, for example, the classes would be taken concurrently.  Is this definitively true and has anyone done otherwise?",

            "comment": "Welcome to Harvard! Many first year students take Stat 100 (with or without also taking a math course); it's a fantastic introduction to statistics. There is no general requirement to take a course from the math department; such requirements would be concentration-specific. There is a [QRD](https://oue.fas.harvard.edu/quantitative-reasoning-data) requirement but many departments offer courses that count for QRD, and there is a very wide range in how much math, stat, and CS various QRD courses cover.",

There is no Stat placement test.\n\nAlmost always the starting point for Stat is one of Stat 100/102/104, or Stat 110 (which I teach). Stat 100/102/104 are non-mathematical intro courses in applied statistics, using the R coding language (but there is no coding knowledge assumed). They have different \"flavors\" (100 being more general and data sciencey, 102 having some life science connections, and 104 having some  Econ connections). Stat 110 is an intro to probability, and *much* more mathematical than Stat 100/102/104 (though with no coding). There is almost no overlap between Stat 100 and 110, so some students take both at some point.",

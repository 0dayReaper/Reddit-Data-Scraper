I think you definitely want to try to have an actual conversation with them over the phone to plead your case so they connect an actual human being and advocate for you instead of just text on a screen. Maybe try to see if you can schedule an appointment to call so they set aside time for you? These are just my guesses I\u2019m still not sure how it worked and might have just gotten lucky tbh so I dont want to promise anything. I am also undergrad so I dont know how things will apply for grad students. That said I still really hope you are successful, wishing you the best luck!",

Excuse me what the fuck, the only thing worse than eating at Annenberg is not being able to eat at Annenberg. Why was I not informed of this!?\n\nAnd for every one of you fucking narcs that are going to tell me that I should have read the emails about winter-session, or done \"due diligence\" or \"practiced basic planning/foresight\", I would like to issue a hearty fuck you. There are a thousand fucking emails from those nerds and half of them are telling me to journal my feelings about this new phase of my life and the other half are telling me about some obscure guest speaker coming to talk about climate change's affect on midichlorian counts or some other inane bullshit. \n\nI am fuming.",

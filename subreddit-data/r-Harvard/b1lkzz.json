Also, my weighted GPA ended up still top 10 in a class of... 700 or so kids?  Only semester grades counted, so my D's got averaged with A's and ended up as (low) B's.  Except in one class where I got a C because I had pneumonia during the final and/or didn't study enough.  I mostly got better after freshman year, but still, my unweighted GPA was not very much above 3.5.  I don't remember what it was, exactly.  Long time ago.  Also I did win lots of math competitions, so maybe my un-stellar GPA and SAT were ignored.  Long story short, my family wasn't rich enough to bribe anyone but I still got in.  The admissions office must have made a mistake.  Oh well.  Too late now, bitches!",

There are tons of students who can't afford tuition that seem to have great financial aid packages. Hopefully this is because the administration is putting those donation dollars to good use.\n",

Not a huge deal, but thought it might interest some who are active on here.\n\n**Apparently this isn't for all GSAS phd.s. Sorry if I got anyone's hopes up!",

This financial package is part of the overall benefits available, which include transit subsidies, support for new parents, and free gym membership for students and substantially reduced membership costs for family members.\n\nI hope this news is helpful to you as you are making plans for the upcoming academic year.\n\nWith all best wishes,\n\nRobert Coughlin\n\nDean for Admissions and Financial Aid, Harvard Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences",

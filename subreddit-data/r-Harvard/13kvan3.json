    "postText": "I am an incoming GSE student and have submitted my application for the GSAS Residence Halls before the priority deadline. I am aware that all GSAS first-year students are guaranteed a room and therefore was wondering about the chances of landing a spot as a non-GSAS student in the lottery. I\u2018ve been put on the waitlist for the Law School Residence Hall managed by HGSE and was assigned a super late window for HUHousing so the anxiety is really starting to creep up on me. Any insight would be much appreciated!",

    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m a first year PhD student in chemical biology, and am thinking about courses for the spring. I have no prior CS experience, but am interested in gaining background/skills in CS or biostatistics or computational bio. Any ideas of courses that I can look into? (I\u2019ve seen BST282, but I\u2019m not sure if that would be too difficult with no prior CS experience - I\u2019d love to hear if anyone has thoughts on that one.) Thanks!!",

            "comment": "If you have no prior programming experience, it\u2019s likely the CS class you\u2019d take would be pretty rudimentary, going over variables, loops, conditionals, maybe OOP and data structures (i.e. stuff not immediately useful for any research you\u2019ll eventually do).\n\nThe stats course will likely be more useful for chemical biology, and you can get the best of both worlds if the stats class goes over programming in R.\n\ntldr; CS if you\u2019re fine committing 1-2 yrs to become proficient enough in coding. Stats if you want an immediately useful class, preferably teaches R",

These include BMI 713+715, BMI 703+705, and BST 219, 260, or 273. \n\nHow are your math and stats foundations? If you're solid on standard intro stats material and linear algebra, BST 210 (Applied Regression) is a good course to push you further into statistics and will be offered this spring, but it's not geared toward coding or CS. \n\nBST 282 might have been subject to an overhaul due to the departure of the original professor. If not, the 2021 materials are [all online](https://liulab-dfci.github.io/bioinfo-combio/) if you want to take a look, and lecture videos going back several years are on YouTube. The course has been fast-paced and coding experience is encouraged, but given that you'll presumably have a stronger background on the science and biotechnology I think it would be doable. However, it is a time-consuming course, no matter how much experience one brings; I wouldn't recommend it for a \"fun\" course unless there has been a really dramatic overhaul.",

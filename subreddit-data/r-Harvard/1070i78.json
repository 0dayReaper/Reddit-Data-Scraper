I'm currently searching for other positions to help better sustain my education, and I'm wondering if getting a Harvard-branded card would be a good idea. I know [the provost allows them](https://trademark.harvard.edu/business-card-authorization-guidelines-harvard-affiliates), and I'm fairly sure I could get authorization from my professor.",

Printing costs money, non-premium LinkedIn is free.",

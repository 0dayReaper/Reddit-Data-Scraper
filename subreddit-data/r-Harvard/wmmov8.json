            "comment": "Generally speaking, I've heard great things about most of the freshman seminars offered, and Mankiw is a giant in the field, so it seems like a great opportunity if you're really interested.\n\nWhat I will say is that, if you're planning a rigorous courseload (see: double concentrations, department honors, etc.), you might be better off trying to fulfill some requirements instead.\n\nI should also note that, on rare occasion, some seminars are counted in the requirements within some concentrations (off the top of my head, some seminars and geneds can double count for electives in Economics and Government).\n\nOverall, if it's something that interests you, do it! Freshman seminars are a great way to balance out the stress of your other classes, and a great way to get to know a prominent professor (in a school where it's sometimes difficult to do so).",

I didn't find the workload to be that heavy at all (if anything, it was probably my lightest course that semester!), and it was a great opportunity to explore my interests in economics!",

Twice per week, 2 hour seminar with tons of books to read and grades assignments. While I am considering a concentration in Economics I also want to try out The Stats course for my first semester while I\u2019m already taking Principles of Macro. So, my question is: Is this Seminar worth taking over The Intro Stats course?",

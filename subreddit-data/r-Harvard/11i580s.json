I was wondering if anyone can share their thoughts and experiences on living in dorms as a grad student at Harvard. Are they all singles? Any recommendations on choosing them? Thanks so much!",

Harvard University Housing is a great option for singles, but a little pricey. It does include all utilities though, and you don\u2019t have to put down a security deposit or first/last month for rent up front.",

There are four dorms for GSAS grad students (Perkins, Conant, Child, and Richards) and all four buildings only have single rooms! It\u2019s pretty nice. Idk about HGSE housing in particular though.",

The meal plan is about $1400 per semester (you have to pre-pay), and food in the grad dining hall costs 17 cents per ounce (the price is subtracted from the amount you pre-paid). I was initially a little worried I\u2019d run out of money or something, but it\u2019s WAY more than you need (i had $600 left over from last semester and am paying for meals for a couple of my HUH friends regularly at the dining hall lol.) So in my opinion the GSAS housing is worth it! Cheaper than an off campus apartment and you don\u2019t have to spend much time cooking/washing dishes.\n\nEdit: but I think the absolute biggest plus to the dorms is making friends and getting to know more people in GSAS, especially people who aren\u2019t in your program!",

(Those two dorms are basically the same, and I picked one of them to save money lol.) Perkins has a mix of small and large rooms (the large rooms cost more), as well as conant I think. Perkins and conant are older and kind of fancier looking both outside and inside (fake fireplaces and stuff), but the living conditions in all four dorms are the same (all four don\u2019t have air conditioning, but there is heat; they all have shared bathrooms and kitchens per floor, etc.). Perkins is the largest building (has the most rooms) while the other three have fewer rooms total if that makes any difference. There\u2019s also a GSAS residential life website that has info!",

But the GSAS office of residential life is pretty responsive by phone and you can call and ask if they have any private bathrooms (tbh I kind of doubt it but always worth asking!! If they don\u2019t have anything through the dorms, you can get a studio apartment with a private bathroom off campus or through HUH, it will cost a lot more though.)",

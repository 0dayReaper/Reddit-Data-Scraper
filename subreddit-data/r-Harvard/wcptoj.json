    "postText": "Incoming pre-frosh in Wiggs. There are 5 of us and 3 bedrooms. Not sure how to distribute the bedrooms. Should we put a bed or two in the common room? Have one in the common room? None in the common room? Not sure of the optimal arranggement, and to be honest, roommates don't seem open to negotiating. If anyone has lived in Wiggs before and has any opinions that would be awesome.",

The two doubles and the single seem like the basic arrangement. But ask your roommates to have a 10-15 zoom or FaceTime to discuss. Some people don\u2019t care as much as others, some are light/hard sleepers, varsity athletes who need to rise at Dawn for practice. If you sort it out ahead of time, an organic arrangement should come into focus. If not, you\u2019ll have to all agree on the most equitable arrangement. But a first come, first choice is not the way to go. Welcome to adulthood, weird conversations and all! :)",

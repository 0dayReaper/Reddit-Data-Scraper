I will be beginning the MS in Data Science at Harvard university this fall.\n\nFor those who are doing or have completed this program (or those who are familiar), do you know whether you can take some Business Analytics courses from MIT's MS Business Analytics program using the 4-electives that are available? If possible, I'm interested in taking 1\\~2 of their courses since I wish to deepen my understanding the applications of Data Science from a business perspective.\n\nI would appreciate it if anyone who knows about this can give me a response! Thanks.",

                    "comment": "Hi! Nice to see an alumnus of CSE. If possible, could you answer a few trivial questions?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. How much statistical knowledge does the Data Science program assume before beginning? Is Statistics 110 from Harvard open courseware good enough? (In case you don't know what that is, here's the syllabus: [https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/youtube](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/youtube))\n\n2.  I'm a bit curious about the 4-electives requirement (apart from the 1 statistics and 1 data science requirement). It says on the homepage \"Students can count at most 2 non-technical courses towards this requirement\". How strict is this requirement? For example, if you choose to take an MBA class on business statistics, as one of the electives, would this still be considered as a technical course? And does Harvard actually allow you to take MBA courses as well through the elective?\n\n3. Can the Data Science masters students (I\u2018m talking about GSAS, not Extension School) enroll at any course they like without competition? I heard that there were limited seats for very popular courses and apparently Extension School students can only apply on a first-come first served basis. What about the DS masters students at GSAS? Can they enroll to any course without having to worry about this issue?",

I teach the Stat 110 course you mentioned, and along with Prof. Hanspeter Pfister created the first version of the core course CS 109/Stat 109/AC 209. \n\n1. It would be very helpful to know the Stat 110 material, since probability is very important in many areas of statistics, CS, and data science. Some DS masters students have a strong understanding of the Stat 110 material when they enter, while others have less probability experience (such as from taking a course as an undergrad that tried to do both probability and statistics in one semester but watered down both since both are subtle, challenging subjects). A few take Stat 110 in their first semester here. Also, note that Stat 110 is probability, not statistical inference. It would help to also be familiar with basic statistics such as [https://openintro-ims.netlify.app](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app) and some concepts of statistical inference (I teach inference in Stat 111 but there isn't currently an online version of 111).\n2. I don't think Reddit is the right place for that kind of question. It is very specific to exactly which program you're in, exactly which course you propose to take, and is also subject to change from year to year by the committee that oversees the program. You should check with the director of the program.\n3. Most courses in the sciences and engineering have open enrollment for College and GSAS students without a limit. As a DS masters student, you would be able to take whichever of those you want. Some do have limited enrollment, like if it is meant to be taught seminar-style. Then there could be a random lottery or there could be an application process.",

(And of course, along with a bit of Linear Algebra I guess)\n\nThe reason I asked #3 was because there are some courses offered by the Computer Science department (for instance, 'CS171 Visualization') that I truly wish to enroll in but I heard that spots for those were limited to College and Extension school students. But I didn't manage to find any policy regarding DS masters students at GSAS and I wondered if things would be different for them.\n\nI will certainly try to review the Stat 110 material that you kindly shared a long time ago on Youtube before prior to starting the program. Once again, thank you very much for your answer. It is the kind of direction I needed.",

Then of course it would help to have some comfort with coding for the CS side. CS courses typically use Python, while Stat courses typically use R (as the \"official\" language, though often you can choose a different language if you prefer). \n\nCS171 is a wonderful course taught by Hanspeter Pfister, who I mentioned in my previous post. There is not a different policy for DS masters students compared with anyone from GSAS. The course has limited enrollment so there will probably be a lottery. Hopefully you will get in but you should have a backup option for in case you have bad luck on the lottery.",

You mentioned that some DS masters students take Stat 110 in their first semester to build their foundations in probability (for those who feel like they lack them). Does that mean there is no particular limit for DS masters students in terms of what Stats or CS electives/courses they can enroll in? (of course, except the ones with limited spots)\n\nFor instance, can they also take some foundational CS courses aimed at undergraduate freshmen/sophomores if they wish to strengthen their foundations in CS? Of course, if you are not sure about this either, I will ask my course director. \n\nI am sincerely grateful that you spent your time in answering my questions!",

If you are willing to meet me in campus today and transfer in person, please let me know that because a lot of these supposed ticket holders seem to be nowhere near the ball they bought tickets for. \n\nI\u2019m also going to insist on conducting this transaction over our Harvard email addresses if you can\u2019t meet up.\n\nNo, I\u2019m not going to randomly Venmo half up front to a Reddit stranger. If you don\u2019t have a Harvard email and can\u2019t meet in person I\u2019ll prove I\u2019m a Harvard student but you\u2019ll have to send me the tickets first.",

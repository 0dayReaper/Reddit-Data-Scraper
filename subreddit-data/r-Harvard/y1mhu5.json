    "postText": "Hi all. I'm an international graduate student here and always on the receiving end of bile against the university's big endowment and no financial support for students. This is all true and no one knows it better than a student from a less developed world paying the fee in dollars, which is roughly 70 times my local currency. \n\nIrrespective, I'm beginning to get sick of comments from friends and family that undermine the value of the degree and the experience here just because the image of the university is that it is a money-making machine. I love my professors, classmates, and all the resources that are offered to me. \n\nAny tips on how to handle these comments politely? I don't want to take a defensive stand",

Perhaps you are discovering that you have some fundamental traits that are slowly distancing you from your friends and family and that Harvard is nurturing.  An intense education will not make you more relatable to the majority of humanity.  \n\nSelf discovery is a process that never ends no matter how old you are.  Sometimes friends will grow with you and sometimes you grow apart.  Perhaps you need to find new people who will enjoy this side of you.  You could also try simply telling your family that their comments make you feel defensive.  Vulnerability is a powerful tool for defusing tension.\n\nIn any case, if you feel compelled to the defense, your family is going after something you consider critical to your integrity, your core. No smooth rejoinder is going to make that feeling go away.  You\u2019re feeling invalidated.  The only way that gets fixed is with communication and support.",

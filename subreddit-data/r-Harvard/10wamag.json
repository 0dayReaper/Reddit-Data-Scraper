Should I apply elsewhere? Im 22 so going to college wouldn't be a career ender, but also I feel it would slow down the rapid promotions and career growth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFigured I would ask existing students.",

            "comment": "If you really have a full-time job as a software engineer for Google, I don't see why you would want to spend the enormous effort of going to night school at Harvard for a bachelor's degree. Future employers and Google itself will care way more about Google on your resume than Harvard when it comes to your aptitude.\n\nI would recommend taking a course or two if there's a topic you're interested in, but a full degree seems like a waste of time and money in your case. People go to Harvard to study CS so they can get software engineering jobs at places like Google. You're already there. Invest in your career at Google, take a couple of classes on the side or pursue a certification if you're interested in that.\n\nThe only reason I would recommend a program like HES would be if you wanted to get an MBA or something afterwards. Again, if your goal is money, you're already on the right track. Attending HES would probably earn you less money than if you just dedicated yourself to your career.\n\nIf you budget wisely and pour half your money into investments on a Google engineer salary, you could retire at 35 and get all the degrees you want after that.",

            "comment": "I can't speak to the CS program specifically but I have found the quality of the education experience to be quite high during my first few semesters at HES. I'm midway through my ALM and am very pleased with my decision to enroll at the school. I would suggest looking at the courses offered and the instructors. The CS catalog is enormous so I'm sure there's stuff you'd like. The best courses I've had are Harvard faculty rather than adjunct but even they've been great. \n\nBut it's a lot of work. Every now and then you'll find college undergrads who look down their nose at HES and members of the general public don't understand that there's more to \ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41 *Harvard* than college freshmen with perfect SATs. \n\nIf you want a high quality education from a renowned institution then it's a good choice.",

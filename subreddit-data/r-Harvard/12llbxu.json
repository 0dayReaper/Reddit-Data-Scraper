    "postText": "Hey guys, class of 27 admit here, I was wondering if their is anything I should keep in mind before attending visitas. I\u2019ll be visiting with my aunt, because my father worries for my safety as this would be my first time in America. How stupid would I look as a 17yr old being accompanied by an adult? \n\nThank you \n\n(Is peeing on John Harvard\u2019s statue an actual tradition,what time of the day would be best suited to fulfill this tradition?And why does he have a golden foot?)",

I think that general courtesy to your hosts, as well as keeping an eye on what you want to do while at visitas, will go a long way. There\u2019s lots to do over a pretty short period of time so I\u2019d try my best to not get overwhelmed and taking it easy (while simultaneously trying my best to go to all of the places you want to visit!) \n\n(The sacred \u201ctradition\u201d of John Harvard the Urinal is a tight-lipped secret that only enrolled members of the Harvard sidechat are aware of.

At the same time, you would likely be fine on campus alone because, ideally, you would be with other future members of your class. \n\nAs for the foot\u2026just don\u2019t touch it, and, if you matriculate, you\u2019ll learn more.",

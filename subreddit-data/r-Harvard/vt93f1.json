    "postText": "So I'll go light on details to avoid identifying this friend of mine. Use your imagination I guess. \n\n PI asking them to go to their home to do \"personal chores/tasks\".\n\nPI asking them to do things that break workplace safety rules.\n\nAnd of course mandatory 60-70 hour weeks but I have been told previously that's \"\"normal\"\"for academia. \n\nThat stuff screams \"abuse of power\" to me but I am ignorant to academia \"norms\".\n\nIf this stuff is \"normal\" then academia is like half a century behind on workers rights holy shit. \n\nAaaaanyway, Friend is afraid to file a complaint or seek help for fear of retaliation if PI guesses who filed a complaint(small team). They could lose their visa and wreck their degree and career if they were kicked out of their project. \n\nSo. . .\nUh. . .\nAny pro tips or advice? \n\nI can't/won't do anything beyond seek information. Don't wanna cause trouble for them.",

Those are just two thoughts. Both places really and truly are meant to support students or employees. They can at least listen and give best next place to go. Of course your friend is wise to proceed carefully. They can always do the \u201cI am asking about a situation involving my friend\u201d. And if then use the \u201cin my friends case what would be your obligation to share information? To whom would it be shared?\u201d\n\nhttps://gsas.harvard.edu/student-life/harvard-resources/office-student-affairs\n\nPatrick and Jackie are great. I haven\u2019t worked with Sam at all so can\u2019t say.",

                    "comment": "Thanks a lot. Ill let them know. They also clarified a few things after a talk. \n\nThe acceptance letter did come from Harvard medical school. \n\nThey do actually get paid a small stipend and also get some small amount money from their home country. Stipend comes from the PIs grant.\n\nPI is actually not working at Harvard, wrong friend wrong PI, my mixup. PI just works at MGH(as far as we know).\n\n Friend is working on their PHD, is not a post doc.\n\nWith the funding and PI situation,  Does this make them a student or employee?? Both? Neither?  Some sort of quantum nonsense where they are both and neither? \n\nIt's so confusing to me, academia is convoluted. The program that accepted them is Harvand medical school, but the PI is not working at Harvard and the funding as far as they know does not come from Harvard(I don't know how to check either). Does Harvard just help arrange completely unaffiliated jobs for students to get practical experience? Is Harvard medical school just partnered with MGH but doesn't fund the projects? Is it all case by case?\n\n They are heavily considering just quitting and looking for another lab/program to finish their traveling reasearch scholar studies(I think that's the right name). They are so stressed and exhausted and its genuinely painful to see them go through that.  Ill see if they will give the \"theoretical anonymous friend\" thing a try. \n\nThanks again for the help.",

They should be in touch with the Dean of students of the program they are a student in (over at Harvard it\u2019s weird but if PhD I imagine that is GSAS??? \n\nThe Dean of Students can at least IMMEDIATELY know, based on program, the best resources or best point of contact. \n\nHonestly, if they just want to find out where to start they could email Patrick or Jackie who can direct them right. That is no sleight to Sam, I just happen to know Patrick and Jackie\u2019s work and they are both great. I am sure Sam is too, I just don\u2019t know him personally. \n\nGood luck to your friend. I am rooting for them as I always root for students!\n\nAcademia especially at an R1 IS A FUCKING HELLSCAPE. So your friend is right to tread very carefully. Again, they can approach any situation by asking the confidentiality involved and also framing things as hypotheticals until they are confident the advice they are receiving is in their best interest as they see it.",

I know a few that switched, one as late as 5 years in, soooo, that might also be an option.\n\n70+ hours though seems pretty normal. depending on program there are labs where people work much less, but 70+ doesnt seem that out of place to me",

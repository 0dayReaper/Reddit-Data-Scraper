            "comment": "Qguide enables to figure out the more-or-less-objectively difficult Expos classes (I recall the Shakespeare one having a significantly higher workload than others, for example). However, with all the rest of the courses, the difficulty really seems to come down to how comfortable you are with the subject matter, the specific style of writing (scientific vs. history vs. philosophy etc), and how interested you are in it.\n\nI just took the course that interested me in a field I was familiar with from my fall semester. It ended up being a very useful and insightful class! But I doubt it would have been as enjoyable, if I had been completely indifferent about the topic; sure, maybe it would have had less readings but writing on an uninteresting topic is just a special form of torture (to me at least).",

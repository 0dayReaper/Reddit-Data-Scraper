    "postText": "I will preface this post by saying that I have had a great first few weeks here, but now that the novelty of starting a new life at college has begun to wear off I've noticed that I have been slightly struggling socially.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a first-year who just started here, I am finding the social scene a little difficult to navigate. I knew no one coming here, so this was a complete reset of my social life and finding a close group of friends is proving to be quite the challenge for me. There are plenty of people who I would consider myself friends with, but it is very surface level and does not go further than activities like eating in Annenberg. I have not done anything on the weekends with a group of people and have found myself spending my Friday nights alone in my dorm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince I've got here, I've mostly been hoping that extracurriculars would help provide a place for bonding and making close friends, but I have been dropped from pretty much every comp process that I have done. There are a few completion based comps that I feel like I can do, but most of those are just lectures where it is difficult to make good friends. I have joined some cultural clubs, but those have not picked up yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do have a very solid pset group for classes, but it feels like nothing exists outside of grinding our next assignment in whichever library we choose to go to. It seems like a lot of them already have their established friend groups as well, as after we finish working for they night they call their friends and meet up to relax a bit. I am friendly with them, but it is clear that I cannot break into that group of people yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my perspective, I think the issue is that I am not putting enough effort on my end to schedule stuff with people. Up to this point, I have basically been hoping to be invited to events and putting zero effort in myself which is a big issue. But it feels a little strange to ask to do something with people that I only know either very lightly, or only in the context of doing schoolwork.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I mentioned above, I have had a great time here and I know that finding the right group of people is something that will just take time. After all, I have only been on campus for just a couple of weeks and that is not a long time to have made very close relationships with anyone. I just feel a little alone right now, which is probably typical for first-years in the first few weeks of school. If any of you have any tips for me on how to schedule time with other people and break into a friend group, that would be greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "I think your experience is so valid, and it can be so hard to come to Harvard without knowing anyone and feeling pressure to form friendships as close as ones you may have had back home with people you\u2019ve known for far longer than 3 weeks. I also came here without really knowing anyone as no one else from my school or friends from my city were here.\n\nI think it can be a bit intimidating to try and initiate plans with people but maybe one thing you could try is when eating lunch with other people or doing psets, bring up or inquire about their hobbies or what they\u2019re doing and if there\u2019s anything in common then you can build off of that and suggest going somewhere sometime but actually follow through with it. It\u2019s extremely likely that the people you interact with now are also having a hard time or have to go outside their comfort zone to forge friendships, so it\u2019s more likely than not that they\u2019d love to spend more time socializing with you but just weren\u2019t sure if you were interested in spending time with them. I\u2019d say just find something you and a few others would enjoy and go for it! If they say no or things get awkward, either they\u2019re busy or maybe they\u2019re not the people you\u2019ll eventually end up being really close friends with. It all takes time and luck, and as long as you continue to present yourself authentically and take some initiative to make plans once in a while things will come together and you will find your people!\nAlso, if you are in a suite, I would recommend suggesting suite bonding by going to some restaurant or something or a lot of cultural orgs are likely doing some kind of sibfam or mentoring thing that can be a great way to meet people as well! Also entryway meetings can be good too, I met the other half of my blocking group through entryway meetings and one of the people I met there taking the initiative to schedule a meal with me and my suitemates.",

I am definitely trying to be more proactive in planning things with other people, and I know that it will take some time and definitely luck to find those who enjoy doing things together. I am already looking into those cultural orgs with sibfams (already signed up for one a few days ago) so fingers crossed that goes well. I know that it will be a journey to find the right people, but I will eventually find them.",

I would emphasize taking the initiative! I know it feels uncomfortable but others will thank you for it and you\u2019ll feel like you have some agency in this whole thing. This uncomfortable transition is part of college, particularly the first year. Its important to recognize that and not trip up by internalizing it. There\u2019s a bunch of people living away from home for the first time, living with strangers, with almost no rules. Things are just going to be weird until everyone settles down.",

My obvious excuse for the lack of social life my freshman year was that it was fully online and I was not even in the US, but I didn\u2019t feel lonely because I lived at home and had my boyfriend around. Sophomore year was a huge transition for me and I was alone a lot, but for some reason that didn\u2019t bother me at all. I was alone but not lonely. But then come junior fall now, from the day one I\u2018ve just been crying every day because I feel lonely and miserable, getting rejected from all kinds of clubs. I want to stay hopeful though, and I\u2018ve also started to put more initiative into asking people to do stuff with me. It will get better \ud83e\udef6",

I missed a lot of comp deadlines for clubs that seemed interesting because I was so busy with my other stuff that I just didn't find the time to fill out the applications for some reason. Definitely feeling a little bit of FOMO right now with all of my (close-ish) friends spending their time with each other doing club training and other stuff.\n\nThings will definitely get better in the future though.

Having a really great friendship takes time, otherwise, it will be as superficial as the reason for the initial interest. Best Friends were once Acquaintances. Give others breathing room and you remember to breathe also.  \n**VA\\_Network\\_Nerd Moderator | Technology Professional &amp; Parent**  \nStop looking back and start focusing on the now, and tomorrow.  \nYour thoughts keep looking back to what you would be doing right now, at this time of day, and what you would be looking forward to later.  \nYou are focused on the emotional comfort and safety of routine activities &amp; experiences.  \nThere is nothing - not a single damned thing - wrong with this.  \nThose are positive emotions, packed with comfort and happiness.  \nBut that's not where you are right now, and \"here\" is where you need to be to prepare yourself for \"tomorrow\".  \nYou need to fill your mind, and your calendar with new activities that consume your idle cycles and deny yourself opportunities to dwell on the way things were.  \nYour here &amp; now is TEAMING with opportunities and possibilities of new experiences and ideas that can help you grow intellectually and emotionally in directions you may never have even considered.  \nOn the other side of your doom room door there are 30,000 people from all over the US and distant parts of the world who you haven't met yet, and they desperately need YOU to help THEM stop thinking about their home and family just as much as you need them.  \nSo go knock on your neighbor's door and ask if they want to walk across campus to find that Taco place you heard about the other day, or if they want to go check out that other dining hall way the hell across campus, because you heard from a guy, who knows a guy, who's girlfriend's roommate said they make baller sandwiches.  \nGo downstairs and find a herd of people and ask if anybody knows where you can get decent Shawarma around campus.  \nNo, I don't know what the hell it is either, but it sounds awesome and that's your mission right now - to collect new experiences.  \nFocus on the now.  \nFocus on tomorrow.  \nDeny yourself the time to dwell overly-long on yesterday.",

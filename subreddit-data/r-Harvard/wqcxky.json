    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI am an incoming CSE master who really wants to involve in CS research (ideally in machine learning). Good thing about this CSE program is that it offers the opportunity to take two so-called research courses AC 298r and AC 297r. I wonder how good those courses are? From syllabus, it seems (please correct me if I am wrong) that those courses are basically students coming up with an idea and conducting research under the supervision of the professor. For those who took any of these two courses before, did you find them helpful? Do you recommend taking those courses?\n\nThanks!",

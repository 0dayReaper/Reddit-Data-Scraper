There's a lot of reading assigned, but you don'g really have to do much of it. Lightly pay attention in lecture, take the notes on the slide (which are provided online), and you should be fine.\n\nProfessor Patterson is an awesome and hilarious guy, and his lectures tend to be somewhat-rambley and wildly entertaining. Sections are very lowkey and open. Overall, a great course.",

            "comment": "I loved professor Patterson! His lectures were great. Big tip: do the readings, but only what you can. If you do even two (or lowkey even one) a week that\u2019s more than enough to prepare you to argue a point in the exams. LECTURES WILL BE THE MAIN RESOURCE AND THE MAIN SOURCE OF INFORMATION. TAKE NOTES. He doesn\u2019t share slides until a few days before exam dates. But everything you need to say in an exam is literally in lectures. Section DEFINITELY helps too. No need to take notes in section, but participation is very important and helpful\n\nI can\u2019t emphasize enough how crucial it is to go to every lecture, pay attention, and take notes lol. It\u2019s what saved me last year. Also don\u2019t start the final paper last minute (that\u2019s what I did). Start off with the readings about a week you found very interesting, and formulate after having done some readings. I tried to formulate before going through sources, which was my mistake",

I also saw that main room in the center of U-Hall which was beautiful!  Since I don't get out of my office all that often, what are other interesting places around campus I should check out.  (Whatever you think is interesting, I need to get around campus more once it cools down a bit!  Bonus points if you can tell me if the building allows dogs as I bring my dog to work some days)",

And the back garden of Adolphus Busch Hall (across from Memorial Hall, by the Swedenborg Chap) is also a nice place to relax and read for a bit in the warmer seasons (only open like April or May to October I think - same with the garden behind Lamont, which is also a nice, tucked away space)",

And a Neil Diamond musical is at the Emerson Colonial downtown through Aug 7 (with $25 rush tickets) ive seen both and they\u2019re both excellent! Both shows will make a lot of noise at the Tony Awards next year! Though full disclosure, I work at the ART",

Also wanted to say the herbarium and MCZ/museum of natural history have really cool collections that are hidden- sometimes OEB will have open days where you can see the stuff that\u2019s hidden, or go in with a biology class. Cabinets and cabinets of specimens of all kinds. I think the herbarium is like a library so you could request specific items to look at too.",

But it\u2019s been a while.\n\nFor the MCZ i\u2019m not just talking the publicly accessible parts of the museums, I\u2019m talking the hidden collections rooms above and below. But unless you\u2019ve got a connection in the bio department it\u2019s not open to get in. However, I also like walking around the HUCE and EPS portions of those buildings, the lounges have cool photos and things to see too.",

            "comment": "It really depends on what you get out of the experience. HCRP will fund you for one summer break or one semester at a time, but you could keep applying. I first started doing research my freshman spring, and I enjoyed working with my lab mentors. Ended up sticking around till I graduated, but friends of mine were trying out different labs in different breaks or stopping to do a different thing altogether. All up to you.",

            "comment": "Very field dependent. In some fields, it's normal to hop labs. But others, the expectation is that you'll stick around for at least a year, possibly even three-four years depending on when you join. But if your advisor expects you to stay for a long time, then they should hopefully say so. My old advisor told me that he would let me into his lab, with the expectation that unless something terrible happens, I would stick around for the rest of my undergrad. I talked to him start of junior year.",

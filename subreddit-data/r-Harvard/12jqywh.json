    "postText": "Hi there just another incoming grad student stressed about housing!\n\nDoes anyone know the odds of getting a one bedroom (any one bedroom) apartment though HUH housing in the lower price range (2300 sigh) through the lottery? For example, my favorites are shaler lane, kirkland court, and Haskins. \n\nI'm on the west coast and quite over the experience of trying to reach out through zillow/apartments.com after 600 contacts have been racked up for a property posted 4 seconds ago in Cambridge.",

            "comment": "I'm matriculating this fall and just secured a unit at Haskins. Been researching this quite a bit so might be able to share perspectives.\n\nThe odds of securing HUH Apt through the traditional viewing and selection window will depend on the lottery outcome, essentially your assigned selection window. The earlier the window, the better your chances are and vice versa. I've heard cases where some didn't get the chance to select housing as all units had been taken before their selection windows. However, assuming you get a reasonable window, there's a good chance to secure housing if you can compromise a little. What I mean is to make your own \"pool\" of acceptable apartments (at least 10), memorize it, and during selection window go for literally ANY apartment that pops up that's in your pool, with ZERO hesitation.  I learned of a case where someone with a relatively late window took a few seconds too long to hit \"confirm\" for his top choice, and after hitting \"back\", all the apartments were taken. So speed is absolutely critical.\n\nFortunately for me, I was able to avoid the above process as I secured Haskins through the Currently Available List, with the above strategy of creating a pool of acceptable apartments. I refreshed the page exactly at 10AM (the notified time), and saw the listings right away. However, I hesitated for a bit and all the competitive ones were gone in seconds. Took me three failed tries until I secured Haskins on the fourth (all this within 1.5 minutes). Might not have been as lucky if it were a late selection window.\n\nSo, all in all, I'd say make your pool of acceptable apartments, memorize it, and go for anything that pops up right away, no hesitations. The price of not securing one is too high. Goodluck!",

Even when we had our selection window it took not even a minute for all of our first choices to be taken. Ended up in SFP which was not even on our radar, though in retrospect I'm glad for it as there were lots of unknown benefits to where we ended up even if our rent makes me weep.\n\nGotta be quick and flexible with your choices.",

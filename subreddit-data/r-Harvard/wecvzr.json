Any tips on where I can get a quality wheelbarrow for a reasonable price - new or second hand? Also, are there any current students here selling their wheelbarrow?",

But unless you live very close to where you're picking up the furniture, you'll need a vehicle to drive the stuff to your destination. There's a [UHaul place near Central Square](https://www.uhaul.com/Locations/Cambridge-MA/Results/) where you can rent a van for a couple of hours.\n\nAlso, you should know about [Allston Christmas](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=allston+christmas). On Sept. 1 when many leases end, students move out (especially in the Allston neighborhood near Boston University) and leave their old furniture on the sidewalk. People can and do drive around and pick up perfectly good tables, chairs, etc. that others have thrown away. (But avoid upholstered items such as couches, due to risk of bedbugs or other contamination.)",

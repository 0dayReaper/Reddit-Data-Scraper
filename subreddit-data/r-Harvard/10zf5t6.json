    "postText": "Hello! Recently I was really lucky to be offered a place in the MS Data Science program (received the offer yesterday), but I am a bit intimidated by the degree requirements. It says that \"GSAS students must maintain a grade point average of at least a B (3.00) each academic year\", and I have no idea how easy/difficult it is to achieve this for the MS in Data Science.\n\nNo point in enrolling in the program if I can't graduate or fail the degree, so I would appreciate some opinions/anecdotes from those who are currently enrolled in this program or those who graduated.\n\nOf course I know that you need to learn hard and work hard to get a job in this field, but my first and foremost objective is to graduate safely with the degree and I have no idea how strict this program is in terms of grading students on their assignments, and how difficult it is to get a good grade in them.\n\nAre the courses project-based or exam based? I heard that all courses are mainly project based with a lot of coding, is this true? Is it generally doable for students to pass all the courses with a good GPA and graduate successfully? As much as I am happy to be offered a place, I am simply worried that I won't be able to catch up to the 'insane difficulty' of Harvard's courses in Stats and Computer Science, and will end up being withdrawn.\n\nCurrently I have a background in Economics as undergrad, took some fundamental math courses (mainly Calculus, Linear Algebra, basic Stats/Probability. Stats/Probability courses were more applied and not towards pure mathematical statistics). Intermediate in terms of Python usage. Yes this is a huge conversion for me as I started studying the math subjects from junior year. Would this background  be enough to successfully follow and complete the degree requirements?\n\nI don't mind if I don't get a job in the US after this, but I will try to get a Data Analytics/Data Science job after going back to my country.",

My general understanding of this program is that it is for people without a technical background who wants to enter into a career in either data analytics or data science. From your experience, is this true, and how are the career prospects in general? Although I'm not desperate to stay in the US, I am interested in getting a job in Boston if possible since I have a distant relative living there.\n\nP.S. Thank you for the advice, I will brush up on the basics of stats and linear algebra before beginning the program.",

Since I started to study quantitative subjects since Junior year in my undergrad and used all the holidays to barely catch up, I don\u2019t have any internship experience (COVID-19 was serious in my country back then and I wouldn't have gotten internship offers anywhere anyway) and will be going to Harvard straight after graduation. I think the reason I was offered a place was due to some economics research projects I had done using Python but they have very little applicability in the business/practical setting and wouldn't help me much in getting a job. So I guess I need to bet it all on my future experience at Harvard if I wish to go to industry in DS.\n\nDo you think it is still possible for me to get internship opportunities in Data analytics/Data science at Boston in the summer after the first academic year is over? It will (hopefully) be my first experience and I wish to hear from someone who has already gone through the program with their colleagues. How many students there were in my kind of situation and are they all doing well in getting full-time jobs in Boston after graduating? I have someone I know in Boston so it would be really nice if I could get opportunities there rather than other cities, since it will be my first time coming to the US.",

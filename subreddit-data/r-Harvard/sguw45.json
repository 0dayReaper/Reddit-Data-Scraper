    "postText": "Why does this feel like an undergrad school? I'm a first year PhD and I've been really sad lately at how little there is to get involved in as a graduate student. Most of the resources and opportunities that make Harvard a special place are reserved for undergraduates.\n\nMost of the best clubs and orgs are only for undergraduates. Crimson, the entirety of theatre, lampoon, etc..\n\nThe amazing residential life system is only for undergrads. The parties in finals clubs are only for undergrads. What are grad students even supposed to do outside of research? Join the badminton club?? \n\nIn my undergrad I did a lot of writing and theatre as an outlet and now I'm basically banned from doing either in any of the most active organizations.\n\nGoing to a bar and drinking with friends is sooo boring.. I wanna actually do shit. The mountaineering club has been really nice and let me join. Idk it's just hard to make friends outside your lab group and no one really cares. There are no school wide events for graduate students. No culture of going to the Harvard-Yale game. \n\nSome people tell me that this is what graduate school is like everywhere. That most of the institutions are primarily focused on making the undergraduate life as best as it can be. Graduate school is like a job they say, you're supposed to just sit around in lab all day. I didn't know this.. I thought I go to a research institution. To a school where they'd care about making sure we had lives outside of research and had outlets to keep our mental health straight.\n\nHonestly I'm really disillusioned by Harvard and I'm close to dropping out. I'm in CS and turned down a job that pays six figures to join Harvard. I feel horrible. If anyone could tell me I'm wrong and help me find ways to pursue my passions (theatre, writing, lampoon, crimson, etc.) or find opportunities for things outside of lab that would be amazing. Thank you guys",

I think generally these clubs don\u2019t exist because grad students don\u2019t start them.\n\nBut yes grad school is a job and generally as such people find outlets off campus.",

Your job as a PhD is to become the world's expert on some topic that hasn't been adequately explored by other academic investigators. That is the reason PhD students are there, so if you're doing a PhD it's because it lights your fire and you want to devote many years to it.\n\nThat said, it is also important to maintain some balance in life, and if you are finding the clubs and activities are not geared to people like you, there is lots of stuff just in Boston and Cambridge separate from the university for people who want to make friends - it is, after all, one of the nation's premier cities.\n\nI would think back to what you're there to accomplish before you pull the plug and drop out. It's a great opportunity if you hang in.",

There is a one-day futsal (indoor soccer) and a one-day basketball tournament open to ALL graduate schools at Harvard on February 6th in the MAC. This event is meant to help spread awareness of the possible formation of a new [graduate school wide IM sports league](https://engage.gsas.harvard.edu/news/242343). For more information on the tournaments and how to sign up, visit this [page](https://engage.gsas.harvard.edu/news/246356). Please invite your friends from other Harvard graduate schools!\n2. As part of the current IM program, there is a climbing tournament against the undergrad houses on February 5th at the QRAC. GSAS/Dudley is allowed to have 11 climbers participate at our given half hour time slot, which is 4:24-5:24pm on the 5th. The 11 spots will be given to the first people who sign up. Please use this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1IaNCg8tDrTVqaBUPBGZddk-6-TwL-I9aPwqYM7d39Bs/edit) to sign up. Our tournament score will be based on the best climb for each of the participants.\n3. There will be a Foosball and Billiards tournament as well. The link to sign up for Foosball is [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mbqk66THbL1FhlXMp0Xe1Sq6Rssu_CdQRZytOsyxy8M/edit), and the link to sign up for Billiards is [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1waXqhSZTypwIB5V7fr6IuGV0JIF1ZgBIy7YVu-bDmJo/edit). The tournament games will take place throughout the semester, and the when and where for these games will be determined after the bracket is set when sign-up closes in the next few days. It is likely that these will be limited to 10 participants for GSAS/Dudley.There are also plans for a ping pong tournament, but the details for that have not been worked out yet. We will share those once they're finalized. If you have any questions, please let us know!Best,Gino and Ian",

Yes, some clubs have comping processes and honestly shut out most undergrad's that apply (the crimson and lampoon are two of them), but most organizations are fine with all Harvard students joining (grad and undergrad). I'm a PhD student and I'm part of several undergraduate clubs as well as clubs in different graduate departments. As for the undergrad housing, not sure why you'd want live there. According to some undergrads I've spoken to many of the houses are literally infested with roaches and rats...",

Harvard is also our direct community. Why should we have to go elsewhere in Cambridge for outlets? It seems like this is maybe a United States thing where grad students participate less in student life. I did my undergrad in Europe and there were many combined undergrad/grad clubs.  While not everyone desires this outlet (some people in my department have zero interest in getting involved in student life and totally avoid the undergrad community), I'm a recent undergrad and have been yearning to join more clubs.. Honestly, although I like my department, I sometimes wish I'd accepted my offer at Oxford. At Oxford grad students live in college housing and are welcome to join any clubs the wish. From what my friend (who studied at Harvard and Oxford) has told me is both the undergrad and graduate communities at Oxford are way stronger. If Harvard truly follows its motto \"One Harvard\" then there should be more of an effort to bring different communities together. Honestly, I think it would strengthen the university to have more collaboration among all students.",

    "postText": "hey! i\u2019m about finishing up my first year and it\u2019s all gone by so fast. i originally applied as a gov major here (planned on going to law school), and then took expos and realized it\u2019s not really my thing. So this semester i decided to switch things up and took neuro 57 and ls1b so explore bio (an interest of mine for a long time, neuro 57 is animal behavior) and i did well in neuro and love ls1b but have been struggling hard with the assignments. I love bio and i love the work my tf\u2019s have been able to do but im not 100% sure if its the right concentration for me. I love animals and working with them and studying them for research but I\u2019m not sure if it is my thing or if i should just keep it as a passion, my fam puts hella pressure on me to become rich after this so I feel like perusing this is going against what they want. So i took a gov class this semester to keep my writing skills up (LSAT potential) and idk? and i stopped showing up like 4 weeks in and feel disconnected af. I feel like since I don\u2019t know what I want to study yet I can\u2019t decide what it is i wanna do or apply to the right opportunities and feel super lost!! if anyone could give me advice if you were previously undecided and decided i would sooo appreciate it, i don\u2019t wanna waste the opportunities here lmao.",

            "comment": "Just a few ideas, while you have to declare sophomore year you don\u2019t have to stick with it (hopefully that\u2019ll ease off the pressure a bit). Also, if you want to hedge your bets you can always declare a double or joint concentration and worst comes to worst you could drop one of them later on. As for which one to go for I\u2019d honestly say that only you can/should make that choice. Next semester take a mix of bio and gov classes/activities and make a choice then. I know it\u2019s easier said than done but I\u2019d place minimal weight on your parent\u2019s opinion (if you take them into account at all) because they\u2019re not the ones that\u2019ll have to get a job with your degree, you are! Take the summer to assess what you value in a job and what concentration gives you a good balance of enjoyment and employability. I came in as a pre-med, switched to Econ, switched to applied math Econ, and then decided to pursue a double in CS and Econ. I didn\u2019t end up deciding until like a week before my concentration declaration was due. So please take your time, dwell on it, and don\u2019t be nervous if you\u2019re undecided, I was too! Either way I know you\u2019ll make the right decision and congrats on completing your first year!!!",

I also had a crisis last week (cause technically i\u2019ve cleared 3 neuro requirements) and you can make an animal science track in the neuro dept so i was like what if i become a neuro major and go into tech and use gov as a way to get policy and administration (leadership if u will..) experience but i just have no idea, ur comment helped me in feeling like i wasn\u2019t alone tho :)",

Follow your interests and from your post that sounds like bio. Seriously, that\u2019s what college is about, finding out who you are and what you like. A goal of \u201cbecoming rich\u201d is not an end in itself. When you are happy, success follows no matter how YOU define that. Separating from your parent\u2019s ideas and developing your own is also what college is about!",

            "comment": "First piece of (possibly self-referential) advice: beware advice from people whose circumstances were/are different from yours. Specifically, if someone tells you \"Follow your passion, it led me to my success,\" and they are a tall, straight, neurotypical white male born into wealth and privilege, and you are not, then their path may have significantly fewer obstacles than your own, to the extent of rendering the advice hopelessly irrelevant.\n\nSecond, whenever the question is \"A or B?\" the better answer is usually found in the meme: \"Why not both?\" Consider, even if not a full dual-concentration, preparing for a career in animal-related law. Already having a specific area to focus your attention will help you determine more quickly which aspects of law you might be interested in. For example, writing contracts to govern the ethical treatment of animals, or if not practicing law actively, using knowledge of law to draft public policy in animal-related areas (AB or BS, then MPP/JD). Those starter ideas can then guide you to researching which organizations do that sort of work, and you can then request informational interviews from people in and adjacent to those roles to learn more, even if just to filter out what you would not want to do. You might ask people running animal-related organizations what legal issues they need the most help with. At some point soon, ethical arguments leading to legal arguments will drift from the domain of animal rights to AI rights, so developing a broad foundation capable of flexibility will serve you well.\n\nWhen sets of skills overlap, the number of people who can add value to the intersection becomes a scarce commodity, which in turn drives up the cost, or in your case, potential financial reward. And even if you choose to donate time to pro bono causes, then that's even more valuable to the recipients because they might not otherwise be able to afford your fees.\n\nAs for German, consider also the Goethe Uni in Frankfurt, which has a fairly strong law program.",

Having some German proficiency would certainly make your life much easier, dealing with others on a daily basis outside of the lab. Even the non-research staff, like administrative, HR, cleaners, security, &amp;c., will usually prefer German over English. Also, I don't know what the citation is/means, but consider the Goethe Institute's Sprachdiplom as the most-recognized language competency credential within Germany. But you can likely get by with a lower level, like CEFR B2.\n\nI love that connection between Ecuador and nature rights! Don't plan too far ahead -- get as much foundational work in as possible, the hardest stuff first, and keep your options open for unexpected opportunities that arise.\n\nAnd good luck studying for your exams. Remember, when God was a Harvard student, she partied for 6 days and pulled an all-nighter.  :)",

            "comment": "You have time! Like others have said even if you declare something this upcoming fall, you can always change in the next semester or two depending on your situation (engineering is really the only concentration that is hard to switch into later on due to a lot of required courses). I\u2019d recommend being strategic about what courses you take this upcoming fall, going to a lot of the concentration events for sophomores, and talking to upperclassmen you know in those concentrations. \n\nFor choosing classes, think about the possible concentrations you\u2019re interested in \u2014 go on their websites, look at the required courses you have to take, and read about the careers of students who graduated with those concentrations (usually info you can find on the concentration\u2019s website). This doesn\u2019t need to be super serious, but just spend some time weighing your pros and cons for each concentration, even ones you haven\u2019t considered yet but are kinda interested in (history of science maybe?? I\u2019m a history major so I\u2019m biased lol but it\u2019s just always good to be open minded). But basically just try and get a good mix of classes for your fall because it can help you compare how you feel about the different concentrations you\u2019re undecided about (because careers are tough to plan for \u2014 unless you\u2019re premed or maybe engineering w/ set paths\u2014 you can do consulting with any major, and can usually make an undergrad degree work for some pretty random careers. But at the end of the day, you\u2019re gonna be the one taking those required courses for the next 3 years)\n\nThe concentration events sophomore fall are super helpful. Beyond getting to talk to faculty and advisors of the concentration about any questions or concerns you have, it\u2019s great to get a feel for the department. If you\u2019re deciding between gov and a science this might not be as helpful, but say if you end up deciding between the sciences, it\u2019s nice to compare the feel of that concentration with the others you are deciding with. Department size (faculty and students), the department head, even the other students in the concentration can be deciding factors in how supported you feel in a department, which can be helpful in your future if you\u2019re interested in internships, research, and discussing post-grad options. \n\nFinally \u2014 talk to upperclassmen!! You can meet them at the concentration events in the fall (a hugeeee plus to attending these), in your house, even asking your PAF or other upperclassmen you may know if they can connect you to someone they know in those interested concentrations.\n\nHopefully this wasn\u2019t too overwhelming lol because at the end of the day a lot of people change their mind in sophomore year, so you will not be alone in your undecidedness haha. Just focus on taking classes you\u2019re interested in that cover your possible interests and maybe browsing about the concentration requirements and typical careers online. Once sophomore fall starts, the concentration events (which they should blast to your email lol and if not will be on their website or the college events website for sure) and talking to upperclassmen will be super helpful. It will fall into place overtime :)",

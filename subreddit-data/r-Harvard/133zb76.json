            "comment": "&gt;you can only get placed via the BC exam\n\nThat's not exactly right. The BC exam score is just another data point to be used, particularly if your placement test score is borderline. Regardless, the results of the placement test are recommendations more than hard requirements.\n\nAs for the AP exam -it's up to you. Will it make any difference to Harvard? No. If you feel prepared, it gets you out of school for a day. If you don't feel prepared, go ahead and skip.",

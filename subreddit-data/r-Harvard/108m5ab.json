    "postText": "Trying to decide whether to pursue CS or Stats concentration. With limited time left and another concentration, I won't be able to get a joint in CS &amp; Stats. I am currently considering things like my interest in each field's material, future employability/career options, and a prospective degree plan for completing either (for me, either CS or Stats would likely be 8 courses in 4 semesters). Would really appreciate some input, particularly from current &amp; past concentrators. Thanks everyone!",

            "comment": "I'd say stats courses will generally just involve a lot more mathematical proofs, probability-type questions, and working with R, while CS courses can be more applied coding in various languages, with some required courses on theory. Career-wise, I would make the argument that your concentration really doesn't/shouldn't determine your employability; it's more the experiences you create and the interests/passions you pursue. Regarding degree plan, I personally think both degrees have a similar workload (although keep in mind that I believe doing an allied CS joint leads to less required courses than a primary CS joint, while primary and allied Stats joint have the same # of classes)",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'd like to please ask for your advice: \n\nI plan on taking CS 124 in the spring semester, and I'm debating as to whether I should take CS 120 or CS 121 in the fall in order to prepare for 124 (and which one is the better class overall).\n\nI've heard some conflicting things about 120 -- some people have told me that it's a good way to ease into 124 and offers good prep for coding interviews, whereas others have said that 120 does not provide adequate prep for 124 and is too simple. I've also heard that CS 120 is a bit more practical, a bit better taught, and overall less difficult than 121. \n\nSo, should I take 120 or 121? Even though it seems like 120 isn't as well taught and is more theoretical than 121, would taking 121 be better prep for 121 given that it's more theoretical and difficult than 120?\n\nFor reference, I've already taken CS 50, CS 20, and CS 51. Thank you so much all!",

CS120 was astoundingly easy for upper-level CS class, a I didn't feel learn much.\n\nI think the only thing you really need to do CS124 is CS20 and Stat 110. Also, wouldn't necessarily rule out CS61 instead of CS120 and CS121.",

It is possible that I will be taking this course as a graduate student coming from overseas, and I wish to understand exactly what is necessary to smoothly adjust to this course.\r  \n\r  \nBackground: I have some experience in Calculus, Linear Algebra, basic statistics and basic Python programming but that's about it (I didn't do a technical/quantitative major in undergrad so you can take that into account in your answer). I'm required to take a CS elective (has to be above CS100) for my course requirements so I have been looking for doable courses I can take with my current level without consuming much study time (I'm not trying to become a software engineer btw, just interested in satisfying the CS elective requirement). CS120 definitely seems to satisfy my criteria at first glance but I'm not too sure.\r  \n\r  \nIs my background enough for me to complete this course easily, or is more required in your opinion? I would appreciate your advice!",

Some of the content covered in 120/121 is similar to 124, but the difference is that 124 focuses on *problem-solving*, not just knowing theoretical CS concepts. CS120 and CS121 do not have a specific focus on problem-solving. You're already prepared for CS124 if you've taken CS20 or an equivalent proof-based class. \n\nIn terms of how much 120 prepares for interviews, it does help a bit as it's really your first background into algorithmic concepts.",

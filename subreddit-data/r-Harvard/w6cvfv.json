            "comment": "The English Dept calls English 10: \u201cLiterature Today\u201d their gateway course, meaning it\u2019s oriented to students starting out (it\u2019s also a requirement for the concentration). It\u2019s a new-ish class, and this year\u2019s profs haven\u2019t taught it before\u2014but they\u2019re also both AMAZING, so I think it should be a good one. You could also potentially start with English 20 (another concentration requirement)\u2014if you can take it with Prof. Lynch it would be really worth it, I think. She\u2019s so so great.\n\nThose two are mainly focused on literary criticism, history, and analysis, but there there are also a range of introductory level creative writing classes, if it\u2019s writing that you\u2019re most interested in. \n\nAll that said, you can also pretty much start with any 90 or 100 level English class that sounds interesting. Except for the creative writing classes, they really don\u2019t distinguish undergrad classes by difficulty level. I will say that some\u2014maybe especially the 100 levels\u2014can be a bit of a challenge in the first-year fall, as you\u2019ll be expected to have some familiarity with writing academic essays from the start, more so than in classes like English 10 or 20 which are pitched to students still getting their footing academic writing. But plenty of first-years take 100 level English lectures every year and do fine.\n\nReally, just pick something that sounds interesting. As long as it\u2019s not a graduate level class, you should fine!",

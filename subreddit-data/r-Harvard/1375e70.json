However, I just noticed in the pet rider that they only allow 1 dog. \n\nDoes anyone have any idea how strict they are about the 1 dog policy, or is there anyway I could get away with 2?\n\nIn addition, does anyone know how likely it is to get a unit through the housing lottery?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Unfortunately the 1 pet policy also barred me from HUH because as another poster said, they\u2019re pretty inflexible. While I could \u201chide\u201d the cat, I don\u2019t want to risk my housing or pets, esp when it\u2019s in a hostile rental market and tied up with my student financial account. Idk if you\u2019re willing to risk more than me, but otherwise HUH is a non-option. Your other option is to see if one can be an ESA if you have a legit medical reason.\n\nI did end up securing non-Harvard housing for this summer, but it is HARD with dogs. Let me know if you need any pointers because I had to figure it out fast! The Boston rental market is crazy",

I\u2019ve been looking through Zillow, Trulia, and Apartments.com, but it\u2019s looking pretty rough.\n\nCould I also ask when you\u2019re moving in? I\u2019ve been noticing a lot of move-in dates are 6/1 or 9/1. But my ideal would probably be sometime between mid-July and mid-August.",

A lot of people there post for sublets, but there are options for lease takeovers (which is what I did). There was also no broker\u2019s fee since it was done directly with the landlord through the current tenant. You might have some luck there as well!",

That being said HUH has entered my apartment approx 1x per semester as they have installed new appliances, done inspections etc. so you would have to prepare for that which might be stressful. Usually there is a heads up but it will be that they might enter your apartment during a one week time span for example.",

    "postText": "After taking CS 120, will this be good enough to do SWE interviews? Like will I be better equipped to handle leetcode? I don\u2019t have to take CS 124, and only need to study enough DSA to clear initial coding screens and don\u2019t really care about CS academic theory. Please let me know if you think CS 120 is enough.",

That being said, 124 can help greatly and it\u2019s honestly a good course overall where you\u2019ll come out feeling more confident approaching problems. Def recommend you take it :)",

I am currently somewhat on the same boat - super late selection window except I would actually much rather live in the residence halls. I was wondering about the room availability for the GSAS dorms. Was it relatively easier to get a room? I\u2019m an incoming student at the graduate school of education and I am aware that priority is offered to GSAS students....would this largely affect my chances? Thank you once again!",

Because of that the apartments are released in a somewhat staggered manner. I didn't end up getting my apartment through HUH until late July so I think you still have hope. I would also recommend checking back quite frequently because even if someone has scooped up an apartment off of the listing site, HUH gives the renters 1 week to officially sign the lease or walk away so things do pop up as people change their mind.",

But I was able to get my top choice. I hope you\u2019re able to get exactly what you are looking for! I recommend that as soon as your view period starts that you go through and make a list of at least 15 units that you would be OK with. And then logon as soon as your select window begins. Look at the floorplans and riders for each unit. And then you can also look at the listing information for each building on their website. I thought it really helpful to go through each thing and also map out the location. Doing that helped me realize that some of the units don\u2019t really have parking. Not sure if that\u2019s important to you or not but it didn\u2019t see it anywhere, I just realized it by looking on Google maps.",

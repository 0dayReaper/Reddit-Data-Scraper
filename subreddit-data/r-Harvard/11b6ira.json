    "postText": "I'm not sure if the person about whom I'm writing will ever see this, but I really hope he does. I was in the Science Center on Wednesday, and I was having a pretty difficult day dealing with an upsetting situation. I was crying, a lot, sitting on one of the chairs/benches in the Science Center near the side exit toward the Kennedy School. I was on the phone with a friend, venting, and still crying. It was pretty clear that I was very upset and going through something difficult. \n\nSomeone - a young guy who I assume was an undergrad - was walking by, saw me crying, came up to me and gave me a kind look trying to show empathy. He might have been wearing something blue, though it's hard to remember now. He might have mouthed something to try to console me without interfering with my call, or briefly asked me if I was OK. Then he stretched out his hand to me so that I could put my hand in his. I did. After that, I might have said to him that I'm OK, and maybe (hopefully) said thanks. \n\nTo that guy: thank you for showing me compassion and empathy. Thank you for caring. Thank you for offering your hand to me. Your intuition was correct - I really needed human contact and support in that moment. I needed someone's hand. You were right to approach me and try to make sure that I was OK. What you did for me was not a small thing. It mattered a lot.\n\nThe distressing situation that had made me so upset will be resolved. I'll be fine. But thank you for helping me in that moment. More people at Harvard should be like you - but you more than make up for the ones who aren't. \n\n\\- B",

    "postText": "May 2023 S.M. graduate, Harvard is asking students to order official regalia from the Coop, but it's still pretty expensive ($95 for gown RENTALS, not even purchase), anyone know where we might be able to get comparable regalia at more affordable prices? Feel uneasy paying close to $100 for gown rentals that we don't even get to keep afterwards.\n\nAny information appreciated, thanks!",

If you purchase or rent a plain black gown, you risk not being allowed to attend graduation. \n\nBut, I agree - it is very expensive for what it is.  Do you know someone who graduated recently and purchased theirs?",

She let students in need of financial support borrow them for the day - maybe worth reaching out to your trusted profs to see if they have one?\n\nAlso, they are AWFUL quality for the price - I was honestly shocked. My undergrad gown was steamed/pressed and presented on a hanger. Harvard's were crumpled in a plastic bag, my hood had bird shit on it and I had to get it exchanged. They're also made of synthetic material and a pain to iron. The hat is literally polyester covered cardboard rather than a fully starched mortarboard.",

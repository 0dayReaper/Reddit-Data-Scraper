They'll come after you eventually if it's your car, call HUPD/boot/tow you if they catch you a lot. But the ticket doesn't hit your license. Be clever and make friends with the parking folks and it'll bring you far.",

            "comment": "While I\u2019m all about avoiding/contesting \n parking tickets when possible, I think the U police are still regular police so it doesn\u2019t matter what the school knows \u2014 an unpaid parking ticket wont affect you as a student, it\u2019s just like getting a parking ticket from anywhere else (they\u2019ll probably pester you to pay it, boot your car if you have lots of unpaid tickets and they find you later, or most likely just send the ticket to collections if you don\u2019t pay for a long time).  \n\nCollections would come after the car owner on the car registration, since stationary tickets are owed by the car owner rather than the driver I think.\n\nEDIT:  Better option if you don\u2019t want to pay is just to contest the ticket, set a court date, then call to reschedule the court date just before a major holiday weekend.  If the officer is on PTO that day you\u2019ll automatically win the case and the ticket will be dismissed.  I\u2019ve done this for some absurd tickets (like 4-5 mins late parking meters) before.",

You will likely have to pay if you ever try to get a parking permit from them, but it's not really clear to me if there's any way for a private property owner to actually enforce their own parking rules under municipal or state authority on private property. They can certainly tow you from private property. But again, not a lawyer.",

The university matched the address to me and put a hold on my account till I paid it. So when you say \u201cthe school doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s my car\u201d what do you mean? Is it like a family members or a friends? They have ways of putting the pieces together.",

            "comment": "No one can tell the answer to your question based on the information given. Harvard\u2019s parking tickets get certified to the state, just like any other police department\u2019s. If the car is registered in Massachusetts the ticket will be sent to the registered owner for payment. The state will garnish tax returns to satisfy the fine, and will eventually suspend the owner\u2019s driver\u2019s license for failure to pay a fine. Unpaid tickets get farmed out to private firms who get a cut of the proceeds if they make a recovery, so they\u2019re very aggressive.  \n\nIf the car is not registered in Massachusetts, the answer depends on whether that state is part of the interstate citation compact. If so, the Massachusetts ticket will follow the car and registered owner to their home state where it will eventually be collected. If not, the ticket will languish in Massachusetts.\n\nSo all in all, it\u2019s hard to know. But the odds are more likely that the ticket will follow the owner because most states are part of the interstate compact.",

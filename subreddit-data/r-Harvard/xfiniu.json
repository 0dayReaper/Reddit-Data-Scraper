    "postText": "As a freshman that just started here, the Harvard comp process is a little bewildering. I totally understand clubs having application processes so that they can ensure that they have members that are committed, but why do they have to be so damn selective?\n\nLike, I can understand the selectivity for pre-professional organizations like CBE and HCCG, but for clubs like Harvard T4SG (Tech Social Good), which yes is still pre-professional but has a purpose of social impact, they are literally taking like 10% of their applicants?! Like, why? It's literally a club for social good and one of the most useful clubs to get real software engineering experience, but they reject tons of applicants. Who said performing social good should be so exclusive? Again, even in clubs like the aforementioned, I'm not saying to accept everyone, but does it really make sense to basically make the application process just another round of college admissions, especially if you're a club that promotes itself as doing something that is \"good\"?\n\nWouldn't it make more sense to have more of a completion-based comp, that's meant to be challenging to complete to successfully filter out inadequate prospective members?",

            "comment": "Just to be blunt about it- Harvard's social scene is really toxic and competitive. People are addicted to the mindset of achievement &amp; exclusivity, which is really the opposite of what you need to cultivate a healthy social environment.\n\nI felt like a total loser for most of my time in undergrad, blaming myself for not being \"cool enough\" to get into these spaces. I ended up making friends outside the clubs and living with them senior year, which helped. After graduating I realized I was actually great at making friends in normal, healthy social settings - and I'm glad I didn't waste too much energy on the clubs. The kids I knew freshman year who got sucked into those exclusive spaces are still (10 yrs later) in that weird \"put others down to feel special\" mentality - not the folks you want to be friends with in adulthood.",

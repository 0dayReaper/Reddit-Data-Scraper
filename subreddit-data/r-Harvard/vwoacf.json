You just can't have a **microwave** that's not from HSA so that's why people think you need to buy it in a bundle.\n\nThat said, still, save your money. Buy your own micro-fridge and then use the microwave that will be almost all the freshmen common rooms or dining halls.",

Walking down, across the yard, then back across, and walking up the stairs in the middle of winter with snow pouring down is not ideal and I'm glad I had the service. I probably saved a lot of time and effort. \n\nBut unless you're in this specific situation, it's really not a hassle to do laundry. I didn't use it after that first year because the next three years, I had laundry in the House I could easily access.\n\nWith this being said, if you decide to use the service, DO NOT SEND THEM DELICATE CLOTHING. Or anything even remotely valuable. Basically only send them things you wouldn't necessarily mind replacing.",

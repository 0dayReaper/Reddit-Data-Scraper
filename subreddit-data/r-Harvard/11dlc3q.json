    "postText": "Hello! I am interested in pursuing this degree because of the ethics side, and absolutely would love to learn more about medical education and clinical care. However, I suck at math. I would like to apply, but I don't know if there are any math or science classes where you need to do math, or are the classes more of general conversation of the topic and discussing topics and whatnot?\n\nI am currently pursuing a master's in social work degree but would like to work in a hospital someday.\n\nThank you!",

Very few are hired for their ethics acumen ....but ethics positions are hired with people that understand the underlying science (medical, animal, legal and so on) and have an interest to deal with the ethical aspects.\n\nWith regards to sucking at math: Once you learn math with an actual problem to solve (and not as a dry topic in and off itself) math becomes a lot more palatable and is really just a tool to work with. You don't need to love math, you don't even need to understand math to just use the tools you learned from it\n\nYMMV",

    "postText": "Incoming freshman here with questions about classes for next year.\n\nI am planning on taking Math 21A, LS1A, Econ 10A, and CS50 but highly considering (most likely) dropping either Ec or CS for a freshman seminar just to ease into things the first semester.\n\nWould you recommend taking both since I've heard that freshman seminars aren't that worth it sometimes or is it a lot of work/p-set heavy schedule. If I were to drop one what is the difficulty/time commitment/grading like for Ec 10 and CS50 (take as a letter grade)?",

            "comment": "The workload in a freshman seminar depends on the instructor, but in general, it's far less than a pset course. Remember, it's graded SAT/UNS, so any stress over the workload is self-induced; you really have to fuck up to get a UNS.\n\nIs a freshman seminar worth it? Coming from a person who took 2, it depends. If you're interested in the topic, and it does not prevent you from taking a course you need, go for it. If not, don't.\n\nKeep in mind that CS50 has a SAT/UNS option (which is also the default), and unless your concentration requires the course for a grade,  I'd highly recommend **not** taking for a grade. CS50 is also an exception to the rules, so you can take both CS50 and a FS SAT/UNS.",

This means that you will do 5-6 psets a week (which means that you and either cabot/lamont will become very good friends). Do you (obvi), but you may experience a substantial quality-of-life increase by taking a humanities/essay-based freshman seminar.",

I don't think you can actually compare the two because graduate vs. undergraduate admissions look for different things, and a lot can change about a person in four years. Ignoring that, most competitive graduate programs have an acceptance rate higher than the College. Prestige is a weird thing, nobody really cares about your graduate program's ranking unless they're in the same field as you, so to the average person, it doesn't mean anything.",

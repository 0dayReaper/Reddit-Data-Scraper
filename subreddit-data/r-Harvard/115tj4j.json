Price-wise, they\u2019re comparable to Cardullo\u2019s, but Monica\u2019s subs are much larger, and are full of some of the freshest and most flavorful ingredients. The prosciutto special is my holy grail - and then you can go go Bovas across the street for some of the tastiest pastries you\u2019ll ever have. I know it\u2019s not near Harvard like you asked, but whenever you\u2019re in the mood and able to, get out of Cambridge to experience some of this incredible food!",

            "comment": "Is ABC pizza still on Mass Ave in Central?  I used to live on that block (moved somewhere else in 2010, so... a while ago) and I used to get Italian subs there.  It's gotta be a pizza place, because I like anchovies on my Italian sub.  It's *good*, yo.  When I moved, I went to Davis, and I discovered Angelina's in Teele Square, which became my sub place.  Not Mike's.\n\nI bet there's a pizza place towards Porter that has a good Italian sub too.  Shells, maybe?  (And someone's already mentioned Noch's, but when I went to get Italian subs at Noch's they were always very busy.)\n\nIf you're going to Davis anyway, you'll want to get a sandwich at Dave's Fresh Pasta.  Very good sandwiches of the nicer type, not the classic Italian (they do have an Italian sandwich, and it's pretty good, but it's not a sub).  Another good nicer sandwich place is Darwin's, on Cambridge St.  There's one on Mt. Auburn too, but that one's just not as good, I don't know why.\n\nGustazo's in Waltham has *amazing* Cuban sandwiches for lunch, including an amazing vaca frita.  I'm not sure whether the Gustazo's in Porter has them too, but you might want to look into it.  When they first opened, they weren't doing lunch yet, and when pandemic happened they still weren't.  Don't know about now.\n\nAlso there's Al's.  There's one by South Station, but there's also one by MIT somewhere.  Al's is pretty great, but I don't think they toast Italian subs?  Maybe you just have to go to the hot sub line; I haven't tried.  Their large sub is *large*.\n\nThere used to be a Subway in Harvard Square, in a market on Mass Ave towards Central (possibly in the building with the Cafe Sushi, but it might have been the other one).  I don't know if that's still around.  Oh, but there's a Subway in the Garage, isn't there?  Subway is not the place for a great sub, but it *is* the place for a Subway sub, and sometimes that's what you actually want.\n\nHonestly, Cardullo's is always a disappointment.  They're *way* more expensive than they should be, and they never have a particularly interesting selection of products.  Their sandwiches are... OK.  I always go in there when I'm in the Square because I always think they'll have something nice, and they usually don't have much.",

Bob's Italian near Tufts has great Italian and other old school sandwiches.  If you can ever make it to Revere check out the New Deal Fruit Market.  Old school treat.  \n\nBonus...If you're from NYC and Joe's Pizza they're opening right in the middle of Harvard Sq taking over the &amp;Pizza and Milk Bar space.  They don't make sandwiches but it'll be a welcome slice shop in the neighborhood!",

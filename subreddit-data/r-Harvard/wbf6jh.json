Closest to the dining hall and science center which is where you'll spend most of your time (comes in handy in mornings and when it's cold). Also close to the yard which is a great place to be. As for the comfort... not the best but you're not in your dorm much anyway.\n\nI also really enjoyed having only two 5 person suites on my floor. We all became really close and it was basically a 10 person suite. Good times --  '23",

Auburn has better prices than Porter Square, I do know that, and there are two bus lines going to that spot (71 and 73 split there), so not much waiting on the bus.  Porter Square has the advantage of being in walking distance, or one stop on the subway, and an awesome food court.  Great place to go get pho.\n\nThere's also a Whole Foods and Trader Joe's on Memorial Drive, for the record.\n\nEdit: now that I think on it, there's a Shaw's or Stop &amp; Shop, same difference, on Beacon St. about 4 blocks north of the Divinity School.",

All my classes were like a 3 min walk and you\u2019re super close to the science Center and Annenberg which is so clutch. Also if you\u2019re concerned about safety Canaday is probably the most secure dorm. It was actually built to be riot proof. There\u2019s 3 sets of doors before you get into your suite: the Main building doors, the stairwell doors and your suite door. Don\u2019t lose your keys though or you\u2019ll be screwed.

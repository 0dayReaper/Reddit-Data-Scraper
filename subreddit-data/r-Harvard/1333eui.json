I was accepted into HYP as well with similar FA packages, and made the decision based off of location of each school. Cambridge/Boston is far superior to NJ or New Haven.",

It\u2019s a very diverse community that can be down to earth sometimes. You\u2019ll find what you\u2019re looking for here (or anywhere you\u2019ll go for that matter) in terms of social scenes or people to hang out with. I found incredible, very accomplished people to interact with while there. The thing that stood out to me while visiting during prefrosh weekend was that when approached with the question of whether to attend Harvard vs Y/P, students at Y/P would often tell me their school was far superior. In contrast, H students never told me H was superior or put down Y/P, and just relayed their experience. While I didn\u2019t make a decision solely based on this fact, I considered the \u201cbrand name\u201d of the school in my future endeavors as well. Hope this helps",

But this comparison with NYC goes only one way: people in NYC believe they live in the most important city in the world, so to them there is no rivalry at all.",

You think it may help to find out what people regretted?  Would not any person have some regrets with respect to a four year experience. Unless there is a very particular area of study or family situation or financial reason, or friendship reason to decide on one vs the other, it is basically a which one do you like based upon your experience with the school and which one is a better fit for you.  Pretty awesome choices.  You know it comes across as a major flex as compared to a legit question, the answer to which is unlikely to  persuade you in any direction.",

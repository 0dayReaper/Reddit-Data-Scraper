It\u2019s not really private tho\n\n*Oh and the there\u2019s also one in Cabot down the hall from the building manager\u2019s office which isn\u2019t locked behind swipe access",

The piano is in the lounge beside the study/ping pong/pool table area and it\u2019s available for anyone to play 24/7. You just need access to Caspersen itself - the building is unlocked during the day and you can typically just follow a law student inside in the evening.",

Wander around any upperclassmen house basement and you\u2019ll probably find one. If you\u2019re a freshman, there are 2 in the matthews basement, 1 in the straus basement, and 1 in the straus common room. I would recommend Lowell anyway",

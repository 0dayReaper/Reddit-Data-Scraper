            "comment": "At Harvard, undergraduate research opportunities in engineering and computer science are abundant, and students have access to a wealth of resources to support their research endeavors.\n\nHarvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) has a strong emphasis on research, and faculty members are actively engaged in a wide range of research projects. As a result, there are many opportunities for undergraduate students to get involved in research, either through working as research assistants on faculty-led projects or by conducting their own independent research. You may wish to bring by emailing a few professors and see if they have ongoing research projects in which you might fit.\n\nHarvard also has a number of programs and initiatives in place to support undergraduate research in engineering and computer science, including summer research programs, research seminars, and independent study courses. Additionally, Harvard has several dedicated research labs and facilities, such as the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) Laboratory for Innovation Science, which is designed to support interdisciplinary research projects in engineering, social science, and other fields.\n\nTo take advantage of these opportunities, students should begin by exploring their research interests and reaching out to faculty members in their area of interest. They can also seek guidance from academic advisors, participate in research seminars and workshops, and attend networking events to connect with faculty and other researchers in their field.\n\nIn summary, undergraduate research opportunities in engineering and computer science are plentiful at Harvard, and students have access to a wide range of resources and support to help them pursue their research interests. With dedication, hard work, and a proactive approach, students can take advantage of these opportunities to gain valuable research experience and advance their academic and career goals.\n\n**TL;DR** \\- just go to the C.S. Department website, download the list of professors in the C.S. department on there, fire up ChatGPT, ask it to tell them about your undying love for computers (don't worry - I don't expect you to be a genius at writing also -- just worry about the programming part, my friend) and there will be somebody out there who will reply to you. If that doesn't work, try the electrical engineering department. Electrical Engineering exists for people who couldn't get into Computer Science. This reminds of an old joke about a group of electrical engineers, &amp; computer engineers who were on a train to a conference but I will tell you that joke another time.",

My experience in the class is that the assignments can't be fully completed by one person in time, collaborating within the rules helped me a ton. Use the Ed board and office hours as well, posts and attendance are tracked and can bump your grade in the end. Assignments are fun but long and difficult, same with the class content, Eddie Kohler is a really good instructor who is tough but fair. I got a 65% overall and was given a B.\n\nThe past assignments are available online so you can preview what you will be expected to do. The assignments do change each semester but the concepts remain the same.",

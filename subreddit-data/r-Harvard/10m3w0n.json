I was curious to see if anyone else liked the idea of content creation or if anyone currently does it. I think it\u2019d be cool to talk ideas, editing styles, and overall just talk about our ambitions and why content creation. Haven\u2019t really found anyone who shares this interest so I\u2019m turning to Reddit! Lmk!",

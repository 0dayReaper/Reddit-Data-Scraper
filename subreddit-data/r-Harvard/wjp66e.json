    "postText": "Just curious: if you work at Harvard, is it difficult to sign up for HES courses? I've heard that Harvard staff can sign up for an HES course for $40--that is, the tuition drops from $495/credit undergrad or $775/credit grad to just a flat fee of $40 for the whole course--but are there any hoops you have to jump through in order to get this deal? For instance, forms you have to fill out and submit by some deadline, or supervisor sign-off, or anything like that?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "It depends if you're taking classes at the undergraduate or graduate level. If you're doing grad school, you have to prove job-relatedness for your classes, otherwise the difference between the full price and the TAP fee is taxed. This is a newish change for compliance with federal law from 2019/2020. That being said, depending on your role at the University, a lot can be considered job-related. You just need to make your case on the tax attestation form. There's info about this on the Union website. I'll see if I can find it and will edit this post if I do.",

I hope it's helpful.\n\nWhen you register for a course, you'll need to select \"UG\" or \"GRAD\" on the Extension School course selection page. It's at that point where if you've elected to do graduate-level courses you'll need to determine if you think the course could be argued to have job-relatedness in line with IRS guidelines. Either way, you need to do the TAP Form, here: [https://www.benstrat.com/clients/harvardtuition/](https://www.benstrat.com/clients/harvardtuition/). The University will automatically withhold tax from your paycheck ***if*** you selected graduate course credit when registering, ***and*** as the poster below noted, the total non-job-related tuition benefits you've received in a given **calendar** year (not tax year) exceed $5,250 when calculated as \\[full course cost-TAP fee=imputed taxable value\\]. That's basically one class these days, since a 4-credit grad level class costs $3,100. When these tax rules were being rolled out, one of the things the school noted is that the federal cap (that's the $5,250) on graduate benefits hasn't been subject to any updates since the 70's, which is why the cap is so low. I found a little more information about the federal cap here: [https://www.naicu.edu/policy-advocacy/issue-briefs/tax-policy/tax-code-section-127-employer-provided-education-assistance](https://www.naicu.edu/policy-advocacy/issue-briefs/tax-policy/tax-code-section-127-employer-provided-education-assistance). Also, here's a Harvard-specific info sheet that might be useful to you: [https://hr.harvard.edu/files/humanresources/files/qa\\_tap\\_process\\_change.pdf](https://hr.harvard.edu/files/humanresources/files/qa_tap_process_change.pdf).\n\nOn the Benefits Strategies page that I linked above, select TAP, and then you'll select whether you elected undergraduate or graduate-level credit on the Extension School course registration page, and whether the course is related to your job. If you think the course could be argued to have job-relatedness in any way (writing skills, verbal communication skills, general coding skills, skills development related to specific software like Access or Excel that you'd use on the job, etc), write the best argument you can, and then submit the form. Pro tip: **either save, print, or screenshot the form after you fill it out but before you submit it** and then again after when the confirmation page loads. Your manager should be notified that you've submitted the form, review it, and submit it as agreed or note that they disagree with the argument you've written and that your tuition should be taxed. However, sometimes they forget, and those screenshots can be very helpful.\n\nI hope this information is useful to you!\n\nEdit: clarity and grammar.",

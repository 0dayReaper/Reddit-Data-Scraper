New alumni emails are [no longer issued](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/6/12/alumni-email-address/) as of May 2021, and as of Fall 2022 [existing alumni email addresses are being shut down](https://alumni.harvard.edu/help/email-forwarding).  \n\nThe communication of this issue has been terrible and I'm surprised about the lack of alumni/student response.  I do not remember seeing anything in the Crimson since the 2021 announcement, a search of the Crimson comes up empty, and HUIT has no updates on their website.",

I have a [alumni.psu.edu](https://alumni.psu.edu) and [Alumni.Temple.edu](https://Alumni.Temple.edu) as well, and they still work. \n\nIf Temple could figure it out, I don't understand why you guys can't.

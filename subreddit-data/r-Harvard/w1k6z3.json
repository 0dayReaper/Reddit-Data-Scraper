    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m an incoming freshman interested in doing a double concentration in Economics and History of science on a pre-med track. I\u2019ve always been invested in the world of science/medicine, but in the last year my interest has centered around public health! Since money is at the center of health inequity,(and watching a crash course vid on Econ really peaked my interest lol), I\u2019m thinking additional study of economics would be a good idea! \nWhat are your thoughts? Has anyone double majored as pre-med,and what was the experience? Any feedback is greatly appreciated:)",

            "comment": "I'm not sure this plan is possible. \n\nHistory of Science allows joint concentrations, but requires History of Science to be primary. Meanwhile, Ec does not allow joint concentrations of any kind. \n\nDouble concentrations is supposed to make joints easier by removing the thesis requirement and allowing a few courses to double-count, but I can't see this getting approval if the two individual concentrations don't offer a compatible joint in the first place. It's worth exploring with your advisors when you get on campus, anyway.\n\nYou could concentrate in History of Science and get an Ec secondary. The Ec secondary requirements are not too heavy, so you would have room for your premed classes. This will severely limit your electives, however.",

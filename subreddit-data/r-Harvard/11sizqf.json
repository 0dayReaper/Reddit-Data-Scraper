    "postText": "Hello everyone! This is my first time posting here after a few months of lurking lol. I was admitted to HGSE and like many of us here, it\u2019s a dream come true. I\u2019m an international student and now waiting for finaid results and I am also in the process of applying for a couple of scholarships in my home country. I\u2019m married with one kid (5F) and while i really hope that I could bring them with me I have to do some reality check that that\u2019s gonna cost a lot.. even if I score a scholarship, it will only fund my costs. My husband could probably work under J2 visa but I heard it takes 4-6months to get work authorization. And due to weak currency, I would have to spend my whole life savings if they follow me since the cost of living in Cambridge is so high. I hate the thought of leaving my daughter behind but I know this is the kind of sacrifice people make all the time.\n\nIt would be great to connect with any alumni/current students who have/had similar situations before and managed to bring their families with them and make/made it work!\n\nAlternatively, I plan to be as frugal as I can and save up and have they come to visit me for a few weeks.\n\nThank you very much in advance!",

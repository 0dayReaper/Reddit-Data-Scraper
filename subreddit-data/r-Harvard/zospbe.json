    "postText": "Hi guys!! I just got admitted and I\u2019m 99% sure I\u2019ll be committing. I wanted to ask for some advice on if it\u2019d be a good idea to bring a skateboard to college and what kind would be the best. Also what are your opinions are on bikes (I heard they get stolen a lot)?\n\nEdit: and also just general tips for preparing as an incoming freshman? (Thank you so much for your time)\n\nEdit edit: Is it better to get merch in person instead of virtual? (Sorry if that was a dumb question)",

I\u2019m a freshman starting my 2nd semester and I finished CS50 with a B+. Should I take another CS class instead? I\u2019m planning on being an electrical engineering major.",

            "comment": "You probably will be fine. That said, CS141 isn't a class that sophomores typically take. Most will take CS20 (to prep for theory courses to take later on), CS51, or CS124 (if they have already taken a proof-based math course). I also have seen CS181 to be a popular option if you took STAT 110 in the fall.",

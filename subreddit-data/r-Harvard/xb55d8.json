    "postText": "Current schedule is cs50, math21 a, physics 15a, and a freshman seminar. Ive heard that this would be a very tough schedule and honestly I can see how that is possible because though it is only the first few weeks I do have much less time than my peers. Im looking to joint concentrate in cs and physics so I do not know any alternative routes here, one option I have considered is tsking cs50 pass fail to lower stress and yea. Should I dropp a class for an easier one? If so which one? Any advice would be appreciate!",

            "comment": "Hm, I think this depends on how much background you have in cs and physics. If you\u2019ve taken AP CS A, CS50 should be a breeze and just fun psets with only weeks 4/5 being more difficult with memory allocation and such. If you\u2019ve taken any multivariable calc/calc 3, math 21a should also be very comfortable and not too stressful grade-wise. And freshman seminars aren\u2019t generally known to be difficult; it\u2019s definitely way lighter than expos if you care about getting an A in expos.",

Just worried this course scheduke wont allow me time to make wuality connections during my first semester.",

And if you continue as planned in physics/cs50 you might build lasting friendships bc you\u2019ll likely keep taking similar classes and start to rly need pset groups LOL like for cs 124 and harder physics classes",

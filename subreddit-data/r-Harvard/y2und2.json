            "comment": "I don't understand the sarcasm, but a general rule is to only take 3 core STEM courses a semester max then plus one liberal arts course. \n\nHowever, there are exceptions, such as if your astronomy course is more like a reading and regurgitation course (read, note, quiz, done) then you could probably do this with good scheduling techniques. \n\nBut fair warning, I'm in grad school right now for physics taking 4 courses and I'm in the gutter. I barely have A's right now, but I have no free time. Granted in grad school, an A- is an 82-86%, but it's a serious struggle. (I am in QFT 1, QM 1, classical mechanics and E&amp;M 1).\n\nSo bottom line, if you are truly dedicated, and are willing to sacrifice about 80% of your free time, sleep, and some relationships: do it. Get ahead, work hard, and do your best. Good luck and message me if you have any questions.",

Also, Tufts has a nice system we're we can take courses at other universities and get credit here (MIT and Harvard mainly) and it's easier to convince a professor you want to take their course if you have the grades to back it. For example, I want to take a formal QFT 2 and strings course, and if I can just show on paper I have an A in QFT 1 and GR, then it makes the decision more likely a yes.",

I would actually disagree with the other comments here - I think this is actually a very doable schedule, *depending on your academic background and how you are handling this semester*. \n\nI think you should consider how your current courseload looks for considering whether or not you think you can handle the coursework. I'm assuming that you are taking hum 10a and math 25a, so you probably have a good sense of how much time those courses are for you, and the Q is a good way to gage the relative difficulty of the other courses you are thinking about. Another thing to keep in mind is whether you tend to be overconfident or underconfident with how well you can handle your workload.\n\nThere are a good number of people who take difficult courseloads (think Math 55b + CS 124 + other hard classes) and handle it fine because they have a strong math background, and I do think this courseload is handleable for some of the smartest students at Harvard, but definitely not for the vast majority of students. But simply asking whether this is a doable spring schedule (without a sense of your background) is not a helpful question and comes of like a flex (which is probably why you are getting so much sarcasm).",

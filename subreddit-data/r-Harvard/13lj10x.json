    "postText": "Title. I just finished my freshman year, and I had fun. I made friends and learned a lot, but I feel really unfulfilled in terms of extracurriculars. I really want to socially reboot next year and get more involved in fun, non-preprofessional clubs. I am thinking about joining a club sport, but I don't know which one to join. I am in pretty good shape, tall (a guy), and generally work out a good amount in the gym, but I never really did any sports in high school. I was on the golf and tennis team, but I wasn't great. Ideally, I would like to join a club where it's kind of expected that you'll learn in the club. I also would prefer not to have to pay super high dues (idk if club sports have dues but still). \n\nAre there any good club sports in the fall that I should join? What about sailing? or rugby? Which club would be the best way to meet other students (specifically upperclassmen who I wouldn't probably meet otherwise)?",

You can register on archery USA and become a competing member and compete in competitions, or just shoot at practices as a non-competing member. There is no pressure, you can ask for as much coaching as you like or just shoot and figure it out on your own without any coaching. It's very chill and low key, relaxing and like a meditation in a way. Coach Preecha brings bows and equipment for people to use. You can just show up and be shooting in 20 minutes on your choice of distance.\n\nBut you can meet people and do the same activity together regularly. Some people are really hypercompetitive when it comes to sports and some aren't. I think archery is a good one of you're on the laid back end of the spectrum. \n\nI never got a chance to do it but followed the Curling club on social. It seemed very open and welcoming, fun and exciting.\n\nBoxing club is also great if you want good, hearty exercise but don't want to be tied down to a competing schedule. Train and learn the sweet science. No pressure to ever get in a ring and get beat up. You can just punch bags and do padwork with partners for fitness if you don't want to risk brain trauma. (That's what I did.) Flexible. Come to the practices you want, miss the ones you don't have time for.",

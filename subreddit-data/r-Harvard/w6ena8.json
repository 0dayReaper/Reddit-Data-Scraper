I\u2019m on the math side of things, so I don\u2019t know much (anything) about the Econ department. Survivors/causalities, please give me your two cents! \n\nA couple questions:\n1) does this class help one get competitive summer internships?\n2) what do you do after completing it (the next year)?",

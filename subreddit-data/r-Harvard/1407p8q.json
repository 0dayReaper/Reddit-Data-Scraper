    "postText": "Hi, I will be starting a **masters program** (CSE) as part of GSAS starting this fall, and I have a question about the grading requirements.\n\nIt says on the homepage that you must maintain a GPA of B (3.00) to successfully graduate:\n\n[Grade and Examination Requirements | Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (harvard.edu)](https://gsas.harvard.edu/policy/grade-and-examination-requirements)\n\nHow is this GPA calculated assuming that we take 4 courses per semester and that they all have the same credits?\n\nFor example, (as a drastic example) assuming one has three 'B+'s and one 'C', I calculated the GPA to be 2.997. In this case, is the number rounded \"up\" to become \"3\" and the final GPA you receive will be B, which satisfies the requirement set up by GSAS? These kinds of specifics aren't mentioned on the homepage so I'm wondering if anyone knows about it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, it is mentioned that the GPA of B must be maintained for **\"each academic year\".** In that case, for a 3-semester program, what would the grade requirements be for the third/final semester? The first two semesters combined should count as one academic year, which would make it easy to apply the rules set by GSAS, but I'm not sure about the last remaining semester. Would appreciate if anyone can shed some light on this matter as well.",

So you must have a 3.0 at the end of the spring semester *and* at the end of fall.\n\nYour program may have different requirements, make sure to check with them.",

For instance, if you have like 1C, 4B+s and 7Bs that you received until now (just generating random letter grades right now), the GPA is calculated to be\n\n(2.00 + 3.33\\*4 + 3.00\\*7)/12  = 3.02666666\n\nWhich would translate to a CGPA of B (assuming that the courses all have the same amount of credits). Is this the correct calculation approach?",

So if you have a **C** and and **A-**, that is still offset to **B** since +/- is not taken into account?\n\nThis is indeed a bit confusing. What if you have like one C and four B+s? If calculate the CGPA using the corresponding numbers it is above 3.00 but according to the FAS rules, that won't be accepted and you can only use a grade in the A range (A- or A) to offset the C and pass the degree requirements?\n\nThe SEAS department doesn't have anything like that on their homepage though. They only say that you need to have a minimum average of 3.00 to pass, which sounds less strict compared to what's written on the FAS link. I'm a bit confused on which requirements will apply to my degree haha",

I'm just curious about what letter grade one would get if they get those kinds of numbers that don't match (like, if they get GPA of 2.8 would that be a B or B- ?).",

Why ignore the decimals and regard B+ as a B? I'm sure GSAS doesn't regard B+ the same as B numerically  and calculate B+ as 3.00 instead of 3.33 right?",

    "postText": "Is math 21a structured differently in the fall vs the spring? I was looking at the fall 2021 syllabus and it sounds awful with daily psets, weekly psets, meeting 4 times a week, and 4 exams. However, for spring 2022 there's no actual syllabus posted (that I could find. If you have it please send) but on the q guide someone said it's only 1 pset per week. That, I could manage. If you have any insight on this please do tell",

There are a lot of exams (not sure if it\u2019s 3 or 4) but overall the course isn\u2019t that bad. \n\nThat said, you should be able to handle 21a.",

            "comment": "Even tho they say daily psets, they were usually one question, pass it in and show that you put like half a brain cell of thought in, and you got full credit. The weeklys were tough but doable, and MQC is helpful if youre stuck. Exams are pretty low key, and i seem to remember them letting you do correctionsfor half the points back but i could have misremembered",

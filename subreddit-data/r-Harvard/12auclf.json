            "comment": "It is deeply concerning, generally speaking, to hear about incidents like this happening on university campuses. The safety and security of students should always be a top priority, and it's fortunate that no one was harmed in this situation. However, please note that having a gun pointed at you is not the end of the world.\n\nIt's, of course, important for universities to work closely with local law enforcement to ensure proper training and protocols are in place to handle emergency situations like this. At the same time, it is important to view things within context, and realize that a lot of people who are police officers have to deal with worse on an ongoing daily basis. Unless you have significant mental health related difficulties, a gun pointed at you is something you ought to be able to take in your stride.\n\nOne hopes that the Harvard University Police Department and other law enforcement agencies will thoroughly investigate the circumstances that went behind this incident and take steps to prevent negative incidents such as homicides from happening in the future. Please note that there have always been very few homicides on Harvard campus and that the police does have to use a certain level of coercion to maintain that level at zero or close to zero. That does not rise to the level of extremely negative incidents. However, students who are or may be emotionally affected by such incidents should seek counselling.",

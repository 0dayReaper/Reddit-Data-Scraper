They're often taken into the city and then sent to another as a batch to resell on Craigslist etc. If it's really unique people have found them several states away on craigslist themselves by searching. It's an issue for Cambridge and H, with the hot spots being around T stops. Don't trust the garages, don't trust it being public, if you can't take it inside with you where you're going it needs to be expendable.",

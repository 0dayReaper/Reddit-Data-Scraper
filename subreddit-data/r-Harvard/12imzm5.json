That means the money doesn\u2019t have to just sit in the endowment collecting interest in order to fulfill some niche demand. The university can start spending it right now on whatever it thinks is needed most.",

Stanford has 2 admins for every 3 student ( grad and undergrad), and I think it\u2019s uncontroversial to say a *very large* number of them are useless fatcats ( many of whom come from privileged demographics ) whose contribution to the university is negligible or even negative ( eg the Stanford admins who drove a female student to suicide, or the Princeton admins who drove a Spanish professor to suicide). \n\nI\u2019d much rather this have been like Bloomberg\u2019s gift to John Hopkins, restricted to making tuition free. That\u2019s the kind of trend I want to see.",

I've always thought of Harvard as the school that's \"above\" playing this game of naming schools after donors. For $300M, a lot but tiny relative to total endowment, Harvard is technically forever branding one of its largest graduate schools by endowment after a relatively unknown hedge fund guy. You can say Citadel is a leading fund and a guy being $35bn rich is sufficiently well-known. But in reality, outside of the educated/finance realm, Griffin's relatively unheard of. \n\nI understand the Paulson SEAS branding as SEAS is relatively new and needs the dedicated funding. But not GSAS! Very few people are of the caliber suitable to Harvard's naming. I think a reasonable case is Harvard's Graduate School of Government's naming after JFK, considering one, he's JFK, and two, the naming was not influenced by any donation.\n\nTL;DR renaming one of its flagship schools after a relatively unknown guy for less than 1% of endowment is not very prudent.",

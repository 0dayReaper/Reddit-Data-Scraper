Wow, art class sounds interesting. Do you have any suggestions on which to take there?  \n\n\nLibraries, YES! I have visited a few like Lamont, Widener, SEC, Law, Gutman.

I can't recommend any others in particular, but I've heard good things about Loitering, if that's still a class. Film classes at the Center are also fun, but you don't get studio access from them. (You can always just ask art major friends for the door codes...)\n\nAs for other libraries to visit, you've hit a lot of the good ones, but it's worth checking out the Yenching library and the rare books collection at Houghton! And definitely take an afternoon to go and study at the Cambridge Public Library nearby, too \u2014\u00a0it's a great spot and not far from campus at all.\n\nI forgot to mention this in my original post, but being a Harvard student gets you free access to Boston museums like the MFA and Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. You should definitely take advantage of that while you're living in Boston.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman trying to schedule this mess of requirements out and I\u2019m just wondering if 15 minutes is enough time between classes? I\u2019m looking at scooting over to a Life Sciences class from French 40/50 and it seems to only be a 6 minute walk, but I guess I\u2019m just worried about what I\u2019d do if my French class ran late (does that even happen??). Worst case scenario I abandon my scholarly pursuit of French and take on BCS or Japanese or something.",

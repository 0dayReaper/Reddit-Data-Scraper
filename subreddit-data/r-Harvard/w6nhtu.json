In all these interactions, I've never mentioned it unless I'm explicitly asked about where I'm going for college. It definitely hurts to see someone think I'm some entitled jerk before they get to know me. \n\n**Over time, do Harvard students adapt some way of dealing with these types of interactions or just learn to ignore them?**",

Make them good and memorable.\nThe other thing is geography.  Folks from Boston and \u201cnear Boston\u201d know the stereotypes about students are wrong because they see and interact with students all the time.  People from further away only see the media caricatures.  Same goes for stereotypes about us \u201ctownies,\u201d by the way.\nHave fun, \u201826.\nSincerely,\nPh.D. \u201891.",

No.\n\nLook, we get it. You chose Harvard for the prestige. Just because you're incapable of understanding that prestige is not the number one reason for every Harvard student's choice to attend, doesn't mean that you get to try to decide for them their reasons.",

Maintaining an elitist mindset shuts you off from friendship and interaction with the vast majority of the population, the vast majority of whom are not the \u201ccommoners\u201d you denigrate.

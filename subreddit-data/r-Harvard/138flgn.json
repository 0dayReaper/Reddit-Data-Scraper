I was wondering whether anyone on this sub has been a program assistant for the student activities office during the summer and if they can share their experiences with it as well as answer some of my questions:\n\nHow was housing? Did you get a single?\n\nHow big is the time commitment and stress? Is it like you can have a fun summer while doing the job or is it pure stress?\n\nWas the overall experience worth it?\n\n\nI would appreciate any advice and assistance with this! Thank you in advance :)",

It's really difficult to have conversations with people when they are too busy responding to how they feel about where I went to school.",

But if you wear Harvard, it's often perceived as a \"statement\".\n\nPeople will ask \"Lol so did you REALLY go to Harvard?\" I stopped wearing them.\n\nIn the workplace, people that know I have a Harvard degree will sometimes give me weird shit about it. If you hand in a document that's got some goofy error because you've been working on it so long you got too numb to see it, I've gotten \"wtf is this bro. Aren't you supposed to have gone to Harvard?\" There are a lot of other weird microaggressions too difficult to explain. I think the brand kind of trips a switch in people who are naturally really competitive to subconsciously look for ways to try and take you down a peg.\n\nOther times it'll be a weird inferiority complex. Coworkers say weird things like *sad tone* \"Well I wish I could have gone to Harvard instead of my stupid cow college.\"\n\nAnd the \"cow college\" in question will be a high quality Carnegie R1 research University frequently competitive in national championship athletics. And I think what tf are you talking about? Literally everyone I grew up with either dropped out of HS, never finished community college or went to third tier schools on a band scholarship. All of us would have killed to go to that so-called cow college.",

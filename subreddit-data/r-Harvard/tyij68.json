First I read about stealing work for this website, then in another thread I see that he created another website that allows total strangers to host Ukrainian refugees without any vetting whatsoever. That means pedophiles, creeps, human traffickers, you name it, are able to be matched with refugees. Refugees who don\u2019t know the language or culture of the host country, they\u2019re the most vulnerable group in a society. He claims there are over a million active users and many of the posts on the site are men looking specifically for unaccompanied young girls or women only to house. I\u2019m so disgusted\n\nIt seems that in chasing newspaper headlines and internet fame to be the \u201cHarvard man who made website to help refugees\u201d he\u2019s completely forgotten about his morals.

People reached out to him with concerns weeks ago about the human trafficking problem on his site, but he did absolutely nothing and the site is STILL up. I guess it doesn\u2019t matter for him if refugees are being put in danger so long as he gets his name praised all over mainstream media. I want to ask Avi this: If it comes out that Ukrainian refugees were trafficked, murdered, raped due to using your site, will you take responsibility? How can you live with yourself!!!",

I had made my peace with it and moved on before this burst out and it got dredged up again and I reckon it will pass quickly once the whole to do dies down again. Sucks that he made the choices he did but it is what it is. \n\nLife goes on and all I know is shitty habits like that have a nasty habit of lingering. I hope Avi learned something from all this because I think he legitimately has some good impulses on how to help disseminate information in a crisis, but his dishonesty and recklessness makes it a challenge to take his efforts seriously.\n\nAs for money he took donations on a site that had massive traffic figures.

            "comment": "Hi this is Avi and my response.\n\nWhat this is referring to is a map that was on the /map page of my coronavirus tracking website for 2\\~ weeks in the earliest days of this project (over 2 years now). The purpose of the site was to aggregate data about covid.\n\nAround this time I was an active member in the coronavirus tracking world on reddit, I was actually one of the earliest mods of r/Coronavirus, and their map was a great project in a similar subreddit. I thought it would be great to showcase their work on the site, and posted on their subreddit to great response that I was adding it. At the time, my covid site was the \"official\" site of the main Coronavirus subreddits as well, linked in the sidebars and all. There was no ill-will in doing this, simply my site had a lot of users and I thought, why not include a different visual way to represent the numbers on a separate page of the site.\n\nHere\u2019s a link to my post on the covidmapping subreddit from over two years ago, proving I credited their team, which apparently has been removed by their moderators a few minutes ago, very suspicious on their end.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CovidMapping/comments/fc7srx/the_new_map_is_on_the_website/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nScreenshots from my POV, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some kind of removed Reddit service out there that will allow you to verify this image:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/rDY6Jcb\n\n\nHowever, the main issue rose when an article came out in the Seattle Times featuring the site, I was showing them the different pages, and never once did I say the map was mine. I vividly remember telling the reporter how awesome it was that it was ran by a group of volunteers on reddit, and specifically told her it was not my work. However, in the article, they displayed photos of me holding up my laptop showing the map page, I guess they thought it was the most visually appealing part. In a way, it made it look like the map was my project, I remember telling her to credit the team, but again we had talked for over an hour and the map was just one additional part of the site, not the main page/content of the site, and I guess the reporter glossed over including a specific subreddit in the article.\n\nAgain, I want to reiterate that the main home page of the site was where the VAST majority of traffic was on the site, as that was my main project that I was coding all day, completely separate from anything related to the mapping team. If anything, there wasn't even a map on the site for a month+ after I launched it. The map was only ever one addition I thought would help people who prefer visuals over plain-text numbers.\n\nIn the end I decided it would be better if the map on the site automatically pulled the data from the main content of the site, rather than embed a different project's map. This is what has been on the site for 95%+ of its existence.\n\nI am sorry that the author of that post believes I \"stole\" from them, if anything I only thought I was helping them get more eyeballs to their project, their names and links to the subreddit were literally in the main popup of the map when you used it. In that same post, one of the main contributors to the project said \"he just embedded our map on his site, meaning he didn't really copy or steal anything we've made.\"\n\nIn hindsight, I should have made it extra clear to the reporter to specifically include links to their subreddit, but not once in my life have I ever said that map was mine. I'm happy to answer any more questions, as again, nothing related to this is nefarious at all, simply just trying to get vital information into the right hands.\n\nHope everyone understands,\n\nAvi",

How does this make any sense? Thats like me telling you in a DM that I am through a DM giving you credit, no one will see it but only you. Next to this, you posted that post long after media hype, so why did you? While the whole world continues to believe it's you as there is no mention by you in any interview online, or any action that you tried to get the volunteers credited. In fact, when the media started you instantly put a donation button up to start farming it. How much did you earn through donations?\n\nI would suggest that you re-read the main post again.\n\n&gt; The site currently has over 150 unique sources for data, with some of the major countries having multiple sources each that are cross-checked with each other to ensure accuracy.\n\n\nExactly that is currently. But at the beginning of the first several months, I believe the data came solely from BNO. Why did you state in the media that it came from various sources when proof shows it comes solely from BNO? \n\nIn this video, I believe, you are lying. This makes it sound like you did a lot of work, but it was just copy-paste from BNO. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/Nigel__DSouza/status/1247547357505323008\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/KiRJVSJ https://imgur.com/a/mjpMngi\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20200408013326/https://ncov2019.live/",

    "postText": "Just graduated and moved to Boston recently and was planning on visiting Harvard this weekend to take some photographs and explore the campus. Was wondering if you guys could recommend some of the spots on campus with the best architecture in your opinion, or really any cool visually-pleasing buildings. I will be sure not to disturb any students at all.\n\nI have seen some pictures of the library online which seems nice but I was wondering if any of them are publicly accessible and worth a trip in? Is there an official tour where they show some buildings I otherwise wouldn't be able to get into? Appreciate any recommendations you guys got, and if any of you are free to offer a tour on Saturday that would be pretty great \ud83e\udd79",

            "comment": "I'd visit the Center for European Studies. They have a very pretty courtyard, and there's also a space which has a replica of part of a 13th century Freiburg church. Not sure about visiting hours, but I've stumbled in a few times. There are occasional organ concerts there and I'm pretty sure it's usually open to the public.\n\nThere's a video here with a preview: [https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/about-us/history/our-building-adolphus-busch-hall](https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/about-us/history/our-building-adolphus-busch-hall)\n\nNot sure what kind of architecture you're into, but I always found the Barker Center really nice too, though it might require swipe access. And I wonder if you might get some interesting shots in the Fogg Museum. It's spacey with nice natural light if nothing else lol.\n\nWhen I took a history of architecture course, we had to sketch Widener, Memorial Church, the Graduate School of Design, and Johnston Gate, so those are probably the best-known for their architecture besides Memorial Hall (which might be more difficult to get into unless you're content to view the entrance). There are some interesting details on Robinson Hall, and it could be interesting to go inside - I seem to remember a cool atrium space.  I haven't explored the business or law schools too much, but they might have some interesting things.\n\nThere are lots of cool spaces in the Houses too.  Those will be hard to enter unless you befriend an affiliate, but there are some externally photogenic ones.  I'd try taking some photos from the river side as well as the facades.",

I really like the way they integrated the old and new buildings.\n* Novartis building -- designed by [Maya Lin](https://www.mayalinstudio.com/architecture/novartis) of Vietnam Veterans Memorial fame. (I'm actually not a fan of this building, though.)\n* Stata center at MIT -- designed by Frank Gehry",

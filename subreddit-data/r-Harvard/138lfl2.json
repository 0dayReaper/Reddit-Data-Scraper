I stop, say sorry, and then keep it pushing. But as I leave I notice there's a bunch of men in suits around her. Didn't think much of it since a lot of famous/wealthy people like to visit. Imagine my surprise when a friend shows me a picture of Princess Kate on campus, and I realize it's the woman I almost ran over \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

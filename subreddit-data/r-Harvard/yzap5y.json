Have you showed this to anyone who WORKS for Harvard/Yale? I would love to see this used for something for real\u2014the game day webpage AT LEAST, maybe some swag\u2026.\n\nAnyway it\u2019s freaking amazing. Well done. You should approach HSA (Harvard) or the Student Engagement Team at Harvard. Worst case email Lauren Brandt/Rakesh  or the Dean of Students with this! DM me if you need a starting point.",

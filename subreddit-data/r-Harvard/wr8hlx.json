    "postText": "I'm a first-year pursuing the pre-med path. As I'm looking at course recommendations to complete my prerequisites, I'm debating on whether taking the easier intro classes like math1a or LPSA over math1b and LSA1. Since they all complete the requirements, would taking the \"easier\"  classes be a smarter choice since I would typically have an easier time keeping my GPA higher?",

                    "comment": "I'm under the impression that LPSa is a bit more work than LS1a (lecture one more time a week), and also that it spends a lot more time on chem. I did well in AP Chem in high school and felt comfortable with my chem background, so I just took LS1a and felt comfortable with it. Then again, I know things have changed a lot since covid; the course structure for LS1a's been very different since it hit.\n\nIf anything, I recommend reaching out to [Gregg Tucci](https://chemistry.harvard.edu/people/gregory-tucci). He's one of the instructors of LPSa, an advisor for chemistry concentrators, and a really great guy overall. He could probably give you a really good idea of the structure of both courses and which one to take based on your background.  \nAs for Math 1a, while I normally do recommend taking \"easier\" courses your first semester, I've heard the pace for math 1a can be a bit slow. If you're already comfortable with derivatives and can brush up a little on integrals, 1b shouldn't give you much trouble (for context took Calc AB in high school, brushed up a little on 1b content over the summer, then took 1b my freshman fall). Welcome to Harvard, and good luck!",

    "postText": "I would love to hear any sort of feedback for the Online Ed.M at HGSE. Almost half of tuition will be covered by grant and plan to apply for new available scholarships for this new program. I've been admitted to an in-person program there but the online makes sense given the finances.",

            "comment": "It's really hard to gauge whether a program is \"worth it\" for a specific person. It really depends on whether the median placement of the program is a desirable outcome, given the tuition and opportunity costs of the program. I've heard mixed things about the Ed.M program, FWIW. The most satisfied students seem to be the ones that intended on returning to a teaching position.",

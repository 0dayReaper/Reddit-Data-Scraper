How does it work? \n\nOr can you just take any beginners courses without taking the placement exams.\n\nThank you",

            "comment": "Placement exams are for if you have prior experience in a language, to find out which class level is appropriate for you (or to \u201cplace out of the language requirement\u201d ie prove proficiency so you don\u2019t need to take any language classes). So if you\u2019re hoping to study a new language, you can start with the intro class and you don\u2019t have to worry about placement tests.",

I'd like to join some sort of Harvard chamber music or orchestra group but honestly there are so many options and it's hard to tell which ones are at the right level and time commitment for me. Anyone have more information on these or other programs? How serious are each of them and how much time to they require?\n\n* Mu 189: chamber music\n* Harvard Radcliffe orchestra [https://www.harvardradcliffeorchestra.org/](https://www.harvardradcliffeorchestra.org/) \n* Mozart Society Orchestra [https://mozartsocietyorchestra.com/](https://mozartsocietyorchestra.com/) \n* GSAS Student center orchestra [https://engage.gsas.harvard.edu/organization/gsasstudentcenterorchestra](https://engage.gsas.harvard.edu/organization/gsasstudentcenterorchestra)",

            "comment": "&gt;In 2019, Donovan joined the Shorenstein Center to serve as the director and lead researcher of the Technology and Social Change project.\n\n&gt;At Harvard, Donovan was a leading force in bringing the study of misinformation and disinformation to prominence in academia. Donovan has testified in front of House and Senate subcommittees on the spread of misinformation online.\n\n&gt;Tensions between Elmendorf and Donovan rose in fall 2021, according to three HKS staff members, around when Donovan started to work on HKS\u2019 Facebook archive project, fbarchive.org. The archive will provide researchers and journalists with access to photos of documents obtained by Frances B. Haugen, the 2021 Facebook whistleblower who disclosed internal Facebook research on its technologies\u2019 negative effects.\n\n&gt;A year later, at the start of the fall 2022 semester, Donovan was informed that the Technology and Social Change project would ultimately end in summer 2024.",

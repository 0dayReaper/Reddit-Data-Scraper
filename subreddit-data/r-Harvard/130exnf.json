    "postText": "(Starting sophomore year next term.) I would be taking this as a fifth class, so I wouldn\u2019t want it to be too stressful or crazy, but I would like to come away from college with proficiency in a language. Any suggestions for well taught, useful language courses that aren\u2019t extremely stressful (preferably with small class size)? \n\nThanks in advance!",

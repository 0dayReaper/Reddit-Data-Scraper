    "postText": "Recently admitted \u201827. Not committed but was just bored and decided to look at what a first year course load might look like. I\u2019m interested in pursuing graduate study in math, stats, or cs but also want to keep the quant door open.\n\nWas thinking of the following: \n\nMath 55\nStat 110\nExpos 20\nand then either some cs or some gen ed.\n\nInterested in what people think would be a reasonable CS course because I\u2019m struggling to parse the website. I am quite advanced in Python and C++ and have taken AP CS so know some Java. Have a very strong theoretical cs background so if there\u2019s something advanced I can do there, that\u2019s great too. If there\u2019s not a good fit, I\u2019ll just do a gened.\n\nI have self-studied much of the Blitzstein textbook intermittently during hs and took a course in abstract algebra last semester and am taking a course in real analysis this sem, both at a peer institution. As such, although it seems a bit heavy, I think I\u2019m well-equipped to handle it and also have a functioning college experience\u2026 But lmk if that\u2019s delusional.",

            "comment": "I wouldn\u2019t worry about this, you have plenty of time to speak with advisors, explore courses etc. \nBut I will say, expect adjusting to college to be like a fifth course, especially Harvard. Also, idk your background, but this is a little overkill for first semester. Math 55 is like the hardest first-year-level math class in the country. Stat 110 is maybe the hardest intro course at Harvard. Expos isn\u2019t a walk in the park. It\u2019s ok to challenge yourself, but err on the side of an easier schedule rather than a harder one. You have plenty of time to raise the difficulty later on.",

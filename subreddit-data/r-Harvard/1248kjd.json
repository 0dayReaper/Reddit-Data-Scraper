    "postText": "Hi\n\nI'm a depressed as fuck senior taking ec50 because I have to. My motivation and general ability to function are 0, I can't feel any pleasure or drive whatsoever, and I barely make out of bed every day to drag my ass to required classes. I have something between depression, diagnosed PTSD and probable ADD\n\nEc50 has been bad. It's a lot of work when you have no friends in the class, so you have nobody to work with on the labs like most people do. I keep trying to get myself to OH, but can't get over the deep fear and embarrassment I'll feel when I show up and these TFs, who are my peers and younger, will (as I can't help imagining) laugh at me in their heads seeing that I know jack shit and shouldn't be at Harvard n stuff\n\nI did bad on the midterm and bad on empirical proj part 1 because I didn't know it was due until the day it was due. (I entered the class about 2.5 weeks into the term and managed to just miss reminders about the deadline). When I realized the deadline I managed to work at it for a few hours in a frenzy and ended up with about half credit\n\nMy lab credit aside from that ^ is O.K... I did fine on most of the previous ones and have all the attendance points. Not submitting anything for the one due in a couple hours because even when I muster the ability to stop staring at the wall long enough to look at the screen, I can't look at the questions without my vision blurring or without floundering on Stata until my 0 drive gets to negative drive and I give up.  It's only what 3 points so I really can't make myself do it\n\nI have the guest lecture attendance points\n\nI plan to work really hard on project part 2 and study really hard for the final\n\nI know most posts here are bored happy '27 high schoolers asking the big questions, like what the weather's like in Boston, but figured I'd see if there are any alums that can come out of the woodwork and share how hard I'll have to grind to pass \n\nSo anyone know what the grading is like? Is there inflation? Is it curved down, ie should I kill myself?* How likely are they to fail me? I don't give a shit what I get as long as it's not a D\n\n*barely joking but joking all the same\n\nThanks Top Gs",

Just know there are resources to help you and you\u2019re not alone, even though it feels like it. FWIW, Wellbutrin didn\u2019t work for me. \n\nMaybe you can reach out to the professor or a TA too. \n\nAlso, March in Cambridge sucks. It\u2019s cold and spring still feels like it will never come. So just get through a few more weeks and the warm weather will help a little.\n\nEditing to add: ASK FOR VYVANSE, it\u2019s a miracle for me (with ADD). If you are like me, your brain has no dopamine or seratonin right now. It\u2019s hard to function. The combo of vyvanse and seratonin has made me feel so much better. I totally know what you mean about feeling like an imposter. You\u2019re not. You need help and you deserve it. Tell your Dr exactly what you said here, or go online and find a Dr who can prescribe. And see a counselor. Get this squared away now while you\u2019re young!! I wish I had known when I was in grad school at Harvard.",

It might be at some other pharmacy, but I can only go where GoodRX works (don't have insurance that works in Mass). So I haven't gotten to try it. If I ever get to and it doesn't work, definitely asking to try Vyvanse!\n\nThanks for the insight. I can't imagine going through grad school with ADD et al. Holy shit. You're a trooper.",

It makes me feel grounded, like you said. Kind of sucks that we are so bound by brain chemistry. \n\nBut there are things that you can do to help in the meantime. Exercise! It will immediately help. And do something nice for someone else-Random acts of kindness type stuff; Help someone who needs it. Pray. Even if you don\u2019t believe in God, just try it. Proven to help mood!\n\nAlso check out some podcasts like ADHD Rewired. It has some good strategies and stuff. \n\nTBH I was a lot happier when I left Harvard and moved south. It\u2019s warmer and people are much nicer!! So just try your best to finish. You\u2019ve got this!",

When I told her after reading up on it that I think I have it, she said 50% of her patients are parents who realized they had it after their kids were diagnosed. I burst into tears. \n\nI did really well in high school and college like you, and many Drs wrongly think that you can\u2019t have ADD if you have positive school performance. ADHD/ADD is mis-named. It\u2019s actually not an attention deficit disorder, it\u2019s rather an attention regulation disorder. We hyper fixate on what we\u2019re interested in. For me, that was learning new stuff. Probably half the professors I had have it. So just go to a different Dr if they don\u2019t understand that grades don\u2019t matter at all in terms of diagnosis. \n\nYou seem like a really kind and caring person.

Don't keep your instructors in the dark here, they're usually more than willing to do anything possible to help you succeed and be healthy. Harvard has the CAMHS support line at (617) 495-2042, and I believe they offer TimelyCare as well. TimelyCare can get you counseling with therapists even on short-notice, for free. Don't think you have to wait until there's a crisis to utilize these resources!! Also, I see you're on Wellbutrin with meh results. It pairs very well with other medications as add-ons, that could be something to bring up to your prescriber, as well as the adderall shortage (that's my ADHD med, I understand the struggle right now!). Again, getting in touch with your instructors is  the best thing to do here. You don't have to have some huge thoughtful speech ready, just let them know \"I'm struggling, but I am still trying and I don't want to fail.\"   \nHang in there.",

Your resident dean would also be a good person to reach out to about possible accommodations in the course. \n\nI have also gone to the ARC about similar issues and found a counselor there to be really kind. One coach I spoke to there (Khaleem) was very helpful to me. Though they will likely encourage you to reach out to CAHMS and your house tutors/deans but it can be helpful to have someone encourage you to reach out to your support system.\n\nI graduated in December and school can just really suck but things will work out in the end and you have so much to look forward to.

I felt the exact same, my office hours were with people 3-4 years younger than me but they helped me regardless of how they felt, they never made me feel dumb either, and are the reason I'm getting an A and passed CS50. I literally cannot do a single pset by myself as a humanities concentrator and just started asking people for help in class and getting their numbers. We'll collaborate, especially since I've been diligently coming to OH once I realized how helpful they were, so they get info from the TAs and I get their own expertise in exchange. You have to stop being in your head about it bc no one will pull you out of this and it's better to look like a loser asking for a help than fail the class bc you were afraid to.",

I thought I would have to delay graduation and what if I can't pass it on the second attempt either and all this was for nothing and I'm a failure and and and and.\n\nAt the end I passed with wiggle room and another student (my study partner) who was faceplanting even harder with worse grades on assignments ...after the final we both somehow made the exact same final grade (I assume due to however the hell a curve works). And all was well. \n\nMy advice is try to find a way to do a mental reset. Remember you're here because you're supposed to be. Then go HAM on the rest of the class, refusing to give an inch and leave no more \"money on the table.\" Turn in everything. Get every participation point, extra credit point etc from here on out.\n\nI tell my kids all the time about participation pointa/extra credit points they whiff on out of laziness, \"NEVER LEAVE MONEY ON THE TABLE.\"",

I'm going to office hours on Sunday to bite the bullet and tell them I'm struggling to even start the current assignment. i know it's the right choice.\n\nI won't leave money on the table!

I guess I do have some advice actually- you might reach out to the AEO/DAO. Mental illnesses count as disabilities / you should be able to get accommodations",

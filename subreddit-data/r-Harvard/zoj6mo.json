    "postText": "Hi, I'm a 2026er considering taking Chem-20ab over the summer for premed requirements. I'm on financial aid and was wondering if financial aid would cover tuition/housing/food for summer courses as well?\n\nI've also heard about HSS Proctor positions where you get free housing/meals and a 4-credit course, but since Chem-20ab is 8 credits are there other programs like the HSS one but for 8 credit courses?",

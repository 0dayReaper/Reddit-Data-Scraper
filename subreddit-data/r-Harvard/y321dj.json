However, I've been seeing a lot of shirts with just the \"H\" on them, and the coop doesn't seem to sell it. Are these knock offs trying to skirt copyrights?",

Not 100% sure.",

However, the Harvard H is a pretty common symbol that\u2019s been around for a long time, for example the harvard crest in athletics is just an H. I have an H sweater from the Harvard Shop that I love",

    "postText": "Hey everyone! As my username indicates, I'm Prof Matt Blackwell from the Government Department and I'm taking over Gov 50 this semester after a couple of years away. For students that might be interested in the course, we have a [course website](https://gov50.mattblackwell.org) that lays out the plan for the semester and thought it might be of interest here. For context, Gov 50 is an introduction to data science for the social science that assumes no background in statistical computing or statistics (first years welcome!). The goal of the course is to have you learn the professional tools of the data science trade while also understanding vital concepts like causality, prediction, and uncertainty. \n\nThere are several great features of the course that will help students learn. We are moving to a quasi-flipped course structure where students will get practice coding live during class. There is a final project that is producing a public website that documents a data analysis project you will work on all semester (the first entry on your professional portfolio!). We're also planning to have an optional speaker series for the course with great speakers from industry (data scientists at places like the Boston Celtics or Twitter). And so much more. \n\nI'm hosting a Zoom Q&amp;A/Info Session this Thursday, August 18th at 5pm ET (you can find the link on the course Canvas page), but I also want to create this thread in case students have questions that I could possibly answer. I'll try to monitor and respond as questions come in. Hope to see some of you in the Fall!",

A lot of popular tools like git are just a bit more complicated on windows to install. But windows users might have more insight into this.",

Wondering how such a large endeavor like this is orchestrated and organized. \n\n* What sort of \"internal\" tooling is there? \n* How are teaching resources developed?\n* Who maintains the course website? \n\nAre there any public blog posts/videos that go into this? or is David Malan just a wizard!? :p",

Same thing with managing the website, developing course material, video production, etc. Not just all Malan!",

Understanding and digesting CS concepts takes time and lots of help. Luckily, there are tons of ways to get support: sections, labs, tutorials, and so on. If you attend those frequently, CS50 is definitely manageable as a STEM class",

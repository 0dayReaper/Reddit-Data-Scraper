    "postText": "Hey! Hopefully I'm not intruding into your subreddit, but I was hoping I could get some advice on classes to cross-register for at Harvard as an MIT student. MIT's been pretty tech-y these past few years and I'd like to get some of what you guys have going on over at Harvard, since I may have heard a thing or two about your humanities and social sciences ;) Do you have any recommendations for interesting classes that I can take? Any classes that you liked? Famous classes? Classes with great professors?  \n\n\nThanks for any advice at all!! :)",

I'd also recommend anything in the EMR department: I took EMR 1020 on AAPI studies and it was an amazing experience!",

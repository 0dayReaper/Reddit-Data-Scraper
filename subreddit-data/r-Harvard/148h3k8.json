    "postText": "I\u2019m starting a PhD program in the fall and will be continuing my current full-time job as a part-time employee, so I\u2019ll be able to stay on my health insurance plan. I\u2019m trying to figure out if it\u2019s better to do that, or to make the switch to Harvard\u2019s student plan. I also will likely be leaving this job some time next year, either early on or mid-year, so I don\u2019t know what the logistics are around getting on Harvard\u2019s plan when I no longer have insurance through that job (or if they\u2019ll even let me sign on at that time). \n\nWhat are other people\u2019s experiences like in this space? I believe I have access to a financial aid advisor who can help me navigate some of this, but I wanted to first hear what actual students have witnessed.\n\nOn a related note - have any of you actually met with a financial aid advisor and if so, how helpful were they?\n\n\nThanks in advance!",

Had an ER visit with a CT scan and copay was like $100 which was then covered by the union fund. Have been to see three specialists over the past years, all were pretty easy to setup, I think copay was like $35 which was also then covered by the union fund.\n\nProbably either choice would be fine for you. Harvard will probably just tell you to stay on your employer health plan so they don't have to pay for your health insurance.",

I know they\u2019re paying for our health insurance but I\u2019m unsure of how the costs we pay come into play",

For prescriptions you pay at the pharmacy and can also request reimbursement for those receipts. Haven't had any other costs.",

I\u2019ve been so confused looking over all the info packets on student health insurance while hearing coverage is great/not terribly expensive from a handful of folks, scratching my head. \n\nBut - the costs involved with prescription copay\u2019s that I\u2019m seeing suggest medications are super expensive especially if you use mail order pharmacy options, and that really flabbergasted me. I\u2019m assuming this element of the insurance plan is consisted across students? Not sure if you know anything about this piece!",

My health insurance was completely covered. I think it should\u2019ve come with your offer letter whether your health insurance would be covered. \nThe prescription copay depends on the medication. I think it\u2019s covered to a certain percentage. My doctor found a cheaper alternative and it went from 30 bucks copay to 3 every couple of months.",

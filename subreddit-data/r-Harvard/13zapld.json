    "postText": "Hello all!\nI just secured a unit through HUH and it is marked as an accessible unit. I didn\u2019t check the floor plan before I click on to it(I had no luck at the lottery last month and when I saw one unit available I just clicked into it without second thought). Now I\u2019m waiting to receive the lease agreement and there is an accessible rider document under my unit. \n\nI\u2019m not disabled and according to the document, I can sign the lease and move-in with no issue. However when another person needs the room, I would need to move out after HUH\u2019s 60 days notice. I fully understand and respect that, and I\u2019m happy to move and give the room to someone who needs it more than I do. My only concern at this moment is the document says \u201cRelocate you to another comparable unit within Havard University Housing, IF AVAILABLE\u201d. My question is what\u2019s the HUH availability looks like once we go into the semester? My understanding is that the HUH will help me find a place if they can, but the sentence is open and I want to avoid situations for example they have no available units at all and I have to hunt for apartment during finals. \n\nAnyone has experience with HUH availability outside of the summer/lottery time? Should I be concerned about potentially having to move and I\u2019m all on my own? \n\nThanks!!!",

            "comment": "Not sure about in-semester availability of apartments, but also I think you are worrying about a very slim possibility that will presumably never come to pass. Harvard is very cautious about everything and that's why the lease contract is a behemoth that goes over 80 pages, with all these riders and addenda. If you read all the small print, you'll get into a panic mode over all the things that could go wrong. Those things are there to avoid liability, but are really really unlikely to happen in the first place.",

And yea I think you\u2019re right about the \u201cif available\u201d is their way of using words cautiously to avoid any legal issues in the future! \n\nI\u2019ll wait till they send my lease back and sign it without overthinking!!!",

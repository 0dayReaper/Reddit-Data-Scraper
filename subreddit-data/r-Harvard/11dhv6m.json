Coming from out of state, I need to figure out whether to stay on my parents\u2019 Aetna insurance and find new providers. \nIf you have needed neurology or GI, would especially appreciate your thoughts.  Thank you!",

When I needed a neurology consult last year, the wait was definitely under a month. (I didn't end up needing further care from them, so can't comment on quality/experience.)\n\nETA: That said, I have friends who have been less thrilled about their experiences at HUHS. It seems that which primary care \"team\" you get assigned to can make a difference, but you are also able to ask for a switch if you are dissatisfied.",

    "postText": "Hello Harvard students,  \n\n\nWhat are some of your best tips and tricks on saving money/using most of your student status in Boston/USA? Curious to learn what has been your \"golden\" discovery?  \nFor example, I've heard there are quite a lot of places in Boston where you can get discounts on food with your Harvard ID (haven't tried it myself, have yet to arrive on campus in August).",

            "comment": "If you have some background in abstract math / proofs, and want to dig deeper, some courses that are really good are Math 22, Math 25, Math 55 - 25 and 55 are good if you want to spend a LOT of time on math each week, 22 is definitely more chill. These course might be helpful if you want to take any of the theoretical CS courses later, as many of them are proof based. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t done abstract math before and want to get an intro, I had a friend who\u2019s taking Math 101 this term and they really enjoy it!",

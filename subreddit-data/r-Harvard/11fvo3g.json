    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nMy name is DJ, I\u2019m a neurosurgery researcher at MGH/HMS. Since moving to Boston I\u2019ve noticed a lack of any organization such as Free Geek, which sponsors volunteer tech drives to encourage the recycling of old/used pc and consumer tech hardware for either proper disposal or to be repurposed for people/students/other organizations that lack access to decent technology. Being able to give a student in need a functioning laptop is something I\u2019m very passionate about. \n\nI\u2019d like to start a volunteer-based organization such as this and want to find other tech-loving students interested in joining and getting this off the ground. Ideally, it would become an official student group at Harvard but since I am an employee, I would need others' help to make it happen. I hope that making it formal would allow this to continue for many years, hosting tech drives, etc. Let me know if you like the idea, hoping there are enough people to start a discord server and chat more! Thanks in advance!",

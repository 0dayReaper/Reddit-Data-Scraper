    "postText": "Hi their, I'm asking on behalf of my friend. He got an early admit, and full scholarship, for his program. He mistakenly rejected his offer last week, and has just found out that we was removed from the list. Is he still able to get back in if he phones admissions? But they never answer. What would you do in this case?",

If your friend is in the north east, I would consider driving around and knocking on doors.\n\nYou can also try calling Financial Aid, student accounts offices - they may know who to put you in touch with.\n\nTime is going to be of the essence here, because they will be offering his spot around. \n\nIf your friend gets told a hard no, he borked it, and it's done, here are the questions that I would be asking:\n1. Would it be possible for you to process my rejection as a deferment request instead? Can I keep my scholarship?\n2. Can my application be evaluated in the general pool?\n\nYou may want to head over to r/AskProfessors and ask them as well.",

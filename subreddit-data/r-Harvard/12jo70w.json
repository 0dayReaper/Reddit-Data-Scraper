            "comment": "Thank you for sharing this article.While it is clear that the authors have identified several key issues, it is important to acknowledge the complexity of the matter and the need for thoughtful and strategic solutions. I don't think that the conservative-versus-liberal divide is really all that much of a concern for most non-faculty who are actually at the University, irrespective of what tenured professors might think. What most people care about, including students, is just the ability to get stuff done.\n\nWhat is really need is a more inclusive academic culture. In order to create a more inclusive academic culture, it is essential to address the root causes of the problem rather than simply focusing on the symptoms. This could involve implementing measures to prevent bullying, promoting diversity and inclusion, and providing platforms for students to voice their concerns. A number of universities have already succeeded in creating campuses where the students seem, by and large, happy and productive. Harvard could easily learn from their experiences. By taking a comprehensive and collaborative approach, we can work towards creating a more welcoming and supportive environment for all members of the academic community, but I don't think the University is there yet.",

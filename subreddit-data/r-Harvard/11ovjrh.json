Triple deckers generally have shit insulation and you're going to hear the neighbors upstairs.  \n\nHUH costs more but an on-staff maintenance guy will be dispatched same-day to fix an issue with your unit.  You don't pay for heating oil or heating at all, since there's central steam and you can get as cozy as you want without paying for it.  \n\nOh, and unlike the private market, no agency fees!",

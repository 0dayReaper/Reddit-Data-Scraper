Boston free walking tours downtown; tall ship cruise at the harbor;\n\n3. Boston Common, Chinatown, Quincy Market, etc\n\n4. JFK musuem;\n\n5. freedom trail, USS Constitutions....\n\nMost important, I think it doesnot matter where you take them, you spend quality time with family.",

Mount Auburn Cemetery is nearby and hard to explain how beautiful of a walk it is right now without going and seeing it.\n3. Nightshift brewery makes a really decent detroit-style pizza.\n4. Depending on where you're from, pick an orchard 30-40min away and find some cider donuts. The ones downtown at the market are good too, but not quite the same.",

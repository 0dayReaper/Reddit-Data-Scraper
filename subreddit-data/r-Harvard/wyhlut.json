The class is pretty much a show, and you might end up putting 10h+ but I don\u2019t know any single CS student that didn\u2019t get at least an A- in the class.\n\nThis class is considerably easier than the theory classes.",

Most of the class ends up with an A or A-.\n\nCS50 isn\u2019t a weeder class. It\u2019s tailored to be a course that anyone can take. The only reason people would say it\u2019s a weeder course because they think it\u2019s hard.\n\nIf you\u2019re actually planning to concentrate in CS, you should take it letter graded, period. Taking it SAT/UNSAT only leads to cheating yourself in terms of effort.",

In just trying to finish the PSets and make sure things work and stuff like that I had an easy A and did really well on the Final\n\nBig mistake :/",

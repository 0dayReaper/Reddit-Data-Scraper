It is totally fine to do as long as all your roommates agree. If you do plan on having lots of friends over, it is nice to keep the common room free. You might not initially plan to host others, but that might change mid semester. Personally I would only convert it if everyone will be able to have a single or your roommates really want a single.\n\nThe bathroom was attached to the common room, so he didn't have a lot of private space. He ended up hosting some people in the beginning of the semester, but later started to spend more time out of the room where there was more privacy.",

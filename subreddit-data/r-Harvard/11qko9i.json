    "postText": "Hello friends, t'is the season for application results, and I've just got accepted with full tuition coverage! I'll be attending the Div school as a Master's student. But looking at the estimated cost, there's still the $30k worth of living expenses that's a bit...concerning.\n\nThere's also the housing situation that I've heard is a nightmare for Cambridge. Should I just go for on-campus housing (despite the costs) for the first year just to get used to the place, and perhaps I can focus on finding better options later? \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on keeping costs manageable or about finding places to live? Thanks so much!",

In addition to the area right next to the divinity school, if you don't mind being a bit further away the comm ave area in Allston might have cheaper options. The 66 bus runs frequently enough to campus that it is not a terrible commute.",

Units are nice, but the prices are really bad compared to what you can find on Zillow.\n\nEdit- only thing nice about on-campus is that you can move out after 3 months. There\u2019s a $200 fee but at least you\u2019ll be able to get to Cambridge. The only stipulation is that your on-campus unit has to be leased out to someone else before you move, or else you\u2019re stuck with the bill. My unit was leased 1 hour after posting, so this isn\u2019t a huge problem",

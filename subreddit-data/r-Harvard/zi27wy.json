    "postText": "The concurrent masters program is something that I was thinking of looking into (specifically stat), but the webpage for it states that \u201cadmission is often quite competitive.\u201d\n\nThe specific cutoffs to apply for the stat masters are an A- in Stat 110 and 111 and a B in a 200 level stat class by the end of junior fall, as well as a 3.5 GPA overall.\n\nHitting these requirements seems doable for me. However, I\u2019m not sure how competitive the admissions process is. I am not the most stellar student here; I got a B in Math 21b, probably an A- in Stat 110 this semester, and overall my GPA will probably be between a 3.7-3.8. Would I be a good candidate, and if I apply could I reasonably expect to get accepted?\n\nPursuing a concurrent masters requires a lot of course planning beforehand, as well as an increase in course workload and rigor, so this information is very important for me. I would hate to go through all that just to get rejected from the program, so any information on the topic is appreciated!",

            "comment": "I went to a stats concurrent masters info session last semester and the acceptance rate for the program is 100% as long as you fulfill the requirements. I don't think the same holds for other concurrent masters programs, as I'm pretty sure there are people who do get rejected from the CS concurrent masters.\n\nI will say that you should seriously think about whether or not the concurrent masters is right for you\u2014 between the difficulty of grad-level stats classes, the increased workload (4 semesters of 5 classes each) and the opportunity cost of not being able to be as flexible with the rest of your classes, it definitely requires a high level of commitment that might be better spent elsewhere depending on your goals. I personally considered it but will likely end up not pursuing it when applications roll around next year",

    "postText": "Bit of a clickbait-y title, but I can try and explain. \n\nI was admitted to the class of 2027 a few months ago. Since then, I\u2019ve tried to learn about Harvard in a way that\u2019s a bit outside of the standard applications brochure - focusing on courses I\u2019d like to take, concentrations or departments that seem interesting, cool clubs or opportunities, etc. basically trying to inform myself more as I figure out my plans for college and where I\u2019ll go. \n\nMy biggest remaining question mark, though, are the people. What are people actually\u2026 like? I\u2019ve run into two competing explanations and I don\u2019t think either is fully or always true: everyone is either an obsessive networker or it\u2019s just full of amazing magical super smart people. \n\nWhat are people actually like at Harvard? How easy is it to make friends? How toxic(or not) is the environment? hopefully this subreddit can help me figure out a bit more lol",

With the exception of small, liberal arts colleges where random chance of which students join the small incoming class can determine a lot of the vibe, basically every year of students in every T20 college in America is the same. You'll have the \"cool kids\", the pre-meds/laws, the obvious legacies, the student athletes, the stoners, etc. Most universities (and the real world) aren't like high school. There are enough people where, if you don't like spending time with someone, you never have to see them in your free time again. It's all about finding a group and a community you belong in.",

It is the only place I have been where people try to compete with each other for being the \"most stressed out\". Though, this is probably true other peer institutions which attract students with ultra-competitive personalities/mentalities.",

Of course it's not everyone but you're either super magically smart/diligent in your coursework or you're an obsessive networker or you fall through the cracks. Finals clubs having &gt;$4k in membership fees is a symptom of the issue. \n\nThere's a distinct difference between students here and at ivys, than at other schools. An air of pretentious that those that lack it make for great friends.",

People are still much smarter and accomplished compared to the general population. That's it.\n\nOther than that, you'll find all kinds. Rich, poor, modest, boastful, stuck up, humble, euphoric, depressed, hopeful, nihilistic, liberal, conservative. Granted, some of these apply to more people than others, but they are all there. Finding the kind of people you want to be around is non-trivial. There is really no organization for humble people as far as I know:) So it is not as simple as joining a club--well sometimes it is, but usually not.\n\nSo what do you do? Meet and get to know many people. I know it sounds a bit old farty but here is the secret: Harvard students may appear to be superhumans but depression and imposter syndrome are everywhere. A lot of people feel like they have been admitted by mistake and that they would be found out at some moment. So if you are willing to be curious about people and relaxed about your shortcomings, if you are relaxed about your grades and how well people seem to be doing, if you are willing to lend a helping hand when you see someone struggling, it is actually easy to meet people and get to know them. And once you know them, you will get to choose who you want to be around.\n\n(the flip side of all that is if you act like a jerk, you will be miserable, because one thing Harvard students are really good at is being a jerk, that hasn't changed either, so yeah, don't be a jerk, that would make for a really unpleasant Harvard experience:).",

You can be friends and hang out with networking freaks who treat harvard like a stepping stone to their next big thing and not the achievement and great place of learning and experiences that it is, or you can hang out with normal people who share your interests act like you and have similar ideals. A great thing about Harvard is the opportunity to interact with so many kinds of people with many different backgrounds. I guarantee it that you\u2019ll find your kind of people here",

They\u2019ll talk behind your back, make fun of you, and refuse to even acknowledge you.\n\nThese are some of the fakest people I\u2019ve ever met.

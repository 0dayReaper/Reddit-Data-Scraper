    "postText": "hi everyone! i'm scheduled to take ap calc bc, ap macro, and ap micro in the spring, but wasn't sure if it would really help with any placement, advanced standing, etc. i've read conflicting things online so just wanted to clarify.\n\nis it worth taking the calc/econ exams? will it help me skip the intro courses? and even if so, do you think the intro econ courses are worth taking at Harvard if I'm interested in concentrating in econ?\n\nlastly, do students with 4 5s still get to graduate a semester early/take a sem off, or is that all in the past? really appreciate the guidance; i'll be canceling the exams if they're not going to be very helpful in the course enrollment process. thanks sm :)",

Econ is up to you. If you get 5's, you  can bypass 10ab and go straight to 1010ab. Whether. You should do that, even with 5's, is another question.",

My personal opinion as an undergrad was that since you're taking basically \"only\" 32 courses, I did not want to use any of those spaces to retake courses if I didn't have to.\n\nThat said, I was not an econ concentrator, so they may have a different PoV.",

            "comment": "The Micro &amp; Macro exams are crucial for placing out of 10a/10b, while the BC exam is helpful but ultimately a corner case for bypassing 1b (since your placement test for Harvard will ultimately have more say).\n\nDefinitely try to place out of Econ 10a and 10b \u2014 they\u2019re pretty dry + skippable. You\u2019re required to  then sub in 2 Econ electives, so not really \u2018saving\u2019 any time in department by getting a head start, but those hand-selected 2 will likely be far more interesting than Micro/Macro. Would note that you need a 5 to skip a given semester (or two 5s to skip both), so you can\u2019t falter in your prep or on exam day.\n\nBC should be a slam dunk. If you get a 4 or a 5, you should be well-positioned to score well enough to bypass 1b and move into multivariate (21a and the like). A 5 places you out automatically even if you somehow bomb the placement (not likely).",

    "postText": "I\"m a gap year student who took Calculus in my junior year of high school\u2014which was over two years ago\u2014and I worry that I won't do well on my math placement.\n\nI took a statistics course in my senior year, and having this full year of not taking a math course makes me worry that my math skills have become rusty. I don't intend to concentrate in math/engineering, but I also don't want to fail the math placement\u2014as that would not be representative of my STEM-abilities. **Is there any way I can prepare for this? What can I expect from the test?**",

            "comment": "If you don\u2019t do well then you probably shouldn\u2019t be in the higher math classes. I was also a gap-year student and I had taken Calc BC my senior year of high school and got a 5 on the exam. I was placed into Math 1b by the placement test, which is basically Calc BC. Was I offended or did I feel cheated? No. I took the test because I knew I hadn\u2019t used calculus in over a year by the time classes were starting. I still got my degree in chemistry with honors. You\u2019ll be fine.",

I left that job at the end of last school year, and I\u2019m now working as a financial planner studying for my CFA. The math required to do pchem and financial and economics analytics has a pleasantly surprising overlap.",

So probably going through Kahn Academy through AB and BC calc might be good\u2026\n\nbut I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about failing the test because ultimately they say it is just a \u201csuggestion\u201d of what class you can take whatever you want. If you review the above concepts you should probably be okay! Good luck",

Most freshmen that have taken Calc BC will start off with Math 21A (Multivariable) or Math 21B (Linear Algebra). If you\u2019re a more advanced freshmen or want more of a challenge, consider 22A, 25A, or 55A.",

It was the right place for me, and I still graduated with a physics degree. If you want to prepare you can check out a test prep study book for AP Calc from your local library and work through it, skimming the parts that are familiar and digging in to the parts that are fuzzy. But if you're not going to need lots of upper-level math for your concentration I would instead focus on enjoying your summer!",

Literally, as soon as I graduated I forgot everything, and took the placement test and got placed into 1b. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to take 1b, you don\u2019t have to. They likely  won\u2019t stop you from enrolling in 18,21, or 22. I\u2019m grateful I took it because being thrown into more difficult math psets with my limited math expertise would have probably sucked. And it was better taught than my hs math classes lol.",

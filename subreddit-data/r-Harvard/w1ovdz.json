Would you recommend taking them? I\u2019m undeclared now and will remain undecided because I don\u2019t know what I want to do :( just no physics pls lol!!",

It\u2019s also graded pass/fail, so theoretically has less grade-based pressure. \n\nSince you\u2019re undecided I\u2019d say you should go for one in an area you think you\u2019d like to explore, as a way to try something out.",

The class size is small, and most are taught by senior faculty that you would not normally have this type of exposure as a first year.",

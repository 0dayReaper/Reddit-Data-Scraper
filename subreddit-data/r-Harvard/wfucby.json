I didn\u2019t mind taking the exam because if I had wanted to concentrate in classics, it would be good to have that placement taken care of. Instead, I took a modern language I had never taken before at the appropriate into level. \n\nAnd no, you can\u2019t just talk to the professor. It doesn\u2019t work that way for a reason.",

I had talked to a current student in person who told me they didn\u2019t do the placement and the prof said it was fine and they took the not intro but still level-100 class I want to take. My main concern is that I\u2019m taking the language sophomore year so it will be very far away from the placement so it feels moot anyways and I don\u2019t have a lot of the time right now to schedule a placement.",

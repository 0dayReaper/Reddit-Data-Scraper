I'd say (anecdotally) that 1/20 people at the university (outside of HES) that I meet don't consider HES \"real Harvard\", and their argument is always that the barrier to entry at HES is the financial commitment. If that's the case, is an HES degree of someone receiving aid more legitimate than one who is paying their way through?\n\nYou're trying to put shame behind students carrying the name \"Extension School\" on their degree which is wholly unnecessary. As an HES student, I see people all the time in my program who try to pass off their studies as being from the college or another graduate schools, which I find appalling. The idea that our degree is any less legitimate than any other student at the university's is mainly perpetuated by people outside the university, in my experience. A grandparent of mine with a degree from the university considered it legitimate, my family friends with degrees from the university consider it legitimate, the person I'm dating at the college considers it legitimate, the people I meet and become friends with outside of HES at the university consider it legitimate (going as far to tell me to stop adding on \"Extension School when people ask me where I go to school). Are all these people (who have no reason to lie to me, and have a track record of being brutally honest with me) systemically lying to me, even though they have no reason to? If so, why?",

Do some people get in, not because of their grades, but because their family has money? Maybe; I actually have no idea, but that's not my point. Nobody has to buy their way into the Extension School, because HES is one of the least selective bachelor degree programs out there. For all intents and purposes, everyone gets accepted to the program. A couple of years ago, a high school student got his degree from HES before he finished high school. So yes, in theory an HES bachelor's degree would cost less than one from the College, but I don't think an HES degree would have the same value as a degree from the College. I don't think there's any shame in getting a degree from HES, or any school.",

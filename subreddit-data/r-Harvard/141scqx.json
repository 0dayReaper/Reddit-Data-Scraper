Don\u2019t take it personally at all; so many people get rejected from the different programs. If there\u2019s any other pre-o\u2019s you\u2019re interested in, try reaching out to them! (FAP didn\u2019t have a limit in 2021 for instance)",

It is true that FOP is (as we do every year) re-evaluating our safety protocols in coordination with the DSO and other University officials. Due to a plethora of factors which, we did scale back the scope of the program this year, but it is more along the lines of 3/4 of last year's program, which was the largest FOP in recent history (potentially in program history).",

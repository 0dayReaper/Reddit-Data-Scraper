Thanks in advance!",

Basically getting your routine into place. Maybe sit in on a big class.\n\nHonestly if I had my time again, I'd over index on familiarising myself with the surrounding neighbourhoods if you aren't living on campus. I started out on Cronkhite but moved to Porter Square later. I would have stayed off campus the whole time knowing what I know now.",

            "comment": "The school of public health is in Boston, next to the medical school and near the Longwood Medical Area (which is home to several large hospitals). It's not at the main campus in Cambridge where the tours and famous buildings are, though those places are worth visiting, too.\n\nSome places to visit that are reasonably close to the SPH are:\n\n* The walking path through the woods along the scenic (though poorly named) Muddy River, next to the Riverway.\n* The [Isabella Stewart Gardner art museum](https://www.gardnermuseum.org)\n* The [Museum of Fine Arts](https://www.mfa.org)\n* The Fens (basically a big park), behind the MFA. (Not to be confused with Fenway Park, which also isn't too far, but not the right season to visit.)\n* Symphony Hall, home of the [Boston Symphony Orchestra](https://www.bso.org) and host to other events such as a speaker series\n* [The Huntington](https://www.huntingtontheatre.org) for live theater",

I know that Trademark Tours runs a really great student-run tour and the times are super flexible since they run every day as I see tour guides with the signature straw hat all the time!\n\nAlso, make sure to visit some of the open places on campus like the smith center, and the science center to get a feel for the vibes!  \n\n\nIt's an amazing institution and I hope you have fun!!",

I recommend both. https://www.harvard.edu/visit/tours/ \n\nI\u2019d also recommend visiting the museums on campus. The Harvard Art Museums are combined into one entity with joint buildings. It shouldn\u2019t be missed. There is also the Museum of Natural History. \n\nOtherwise, get a paper map and just wander the Yard, checking what you see to the map so you understand where you are. If you\u2019re here on a Sunday you may enjoy services at Memorial Church.  Check Eventbright and see if there are any campus events you can see.\n\nThe Smith Center and Science Center are both open to the public. You can eat at the cafe in the Science Center.",

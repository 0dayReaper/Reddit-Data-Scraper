You will not have access to the full course catalog (one of the highlights of HGSE), all professors (another major draw), cross-registration amongst the various grad schools at Harvard (or MIT), or the general in-person experience - which feeds so many of the relationships (read: connections) one goes to Harvard for in the first place. You won\u2019t come close to receiving the same experience or value. Perhaps if it was half the cost. It isn\u2019t, and it\u2019s absolutely not worth what they\u2019ll charge you for it.\n\nETA: additional detail",

If you\u2019re considering a future as a school administrator, running for a school board position, or as a corporate training manager it should be worth the investment; however, for other things it simply would just be a couple of lines on a resume that might only help if the general qualification is a blanket master\u2019s degree. It wouldn\u2019t be a get rich af degree.",

I had a great first semester in so many ways, and I feel ready to take on a more challenging course load second semester. My other classes would be econ 10b, Spanish 50, and expos. Thanks!",

It depends on how many others enter the lottery for a particular section, as concentrators  get priority. But there are almost always undersubscribed sections.",

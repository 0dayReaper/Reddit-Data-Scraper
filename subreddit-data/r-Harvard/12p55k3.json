    "postText": "Are people at Harvard genuinely happy? I am an incoming Government major and would like to know if people are actually happy to go to Harvard outside of the prestige. How is the Hispanic community (this is a big one for me since I associate myself heavily with my culture)? School spirit (pretty nonexistent im assuming)? Work/life balance? Social life in general?\n\nI am super scared of coming to campus and honestly and worried if I made a the wrong choice and would regret it. Social life and happiness is one of the most important things for me outside of academics and prestige. My top options were Harvard, Brown, and Notre Dame. Mainly between Harvard and ND and am praying I made the right choice.",

Because of this, you'll have a lot of free time to participate in extracurriculars and to make friends. If you don't put yourself out there, it can be lonely just like any other place. However, if you want to have a good time in college, Harvard is great place to be.",

There were groups that catered to both Latino/Hispanic men and women, and a shared umbrella type organization that coordinated shared events and more. Dinners, soccer/fifa, parties. There were also some educational/technical groups Hispanic student groups focused on stuff like specific fields of study and interests. \n\nSchool spirit is not like, as big or pervasive as a big sports school, but it is still very much there. It turns out lots of people are people are pretty proud about attending Harvard. It was all-consuming around Harvard-Yale, and then again during the March Madness runs. I know plenty of people who never attended a single sports game, but there are subgroups who attend everything.",

            "comment": "It's understandable to have concerns and doubts about your decision to attend Harvard, especially given the importance you place on social life and happiness outside of academics and prestige. It's worth noting that the experience of happiness is subjective and varies greatly from person to person.\n\nThat being said, Harvard students, like students at any other institution, experience a range of emotions and circumstances that impact their overall happiness. While the institution's reputation for academic excellence and prestige is undoubtedly a source of pride for many students, it's important to remember that Harvard students are not immune to the stresses and challenges of college life.\n\nRegarding the Hispanic community at Harvard, the university has made efforts to support and celebrate the cultural identity of its diverse student population. There are various student organizations and cultural events on campus dedicated to supporting Hispanic students and promoting cultural exchange. It may be helpful for you to connect with these groups to get a better sense of what the Hispanic community at Harvard is like.\n\nIn terms of school spirit, while it may not be as pronounced as at some other universities, Harvard students do have a strong sense of pride in their school and its history. There are a variety of extracurricular activities and events on campus that foster a sense of community and belonging.\n\nAs for work/life balance, like any rigorous academic institution, Harvard requires a significant time commitment from its students. However, the university also provides resources and support to help students manage their workload and maintain a healthy balance between academics and other aspects of their lives.\n\nCourtesy: chatgpt",

Some people have an easier time than others, but college for everyone does not come without struggle even though it is heavily glorified in tv, movies, etc. Harvard is not a perfect school by any means, but they do a decent job of supporting you with events/opportunities to meet students your first year through your entryway (people on your dorm floor you have weekly/bi-weekly fun events with), your peer advising fellow/PAF (an older student to serve as a touch point throughout the year), your proctor (basically your RA), and having a ton of clubs to join. I have a lot of friends who really love being a part of the Hispanic community at Harvard - I\u2019d recommend joining clubs like Candela (Hispanic dance club), Fuerza Latina, [among many others.](https://sites.harvard.edu/latinx/latinx-organizations/) to help meet people.\n\nIf you prioritize your own social life and happiness then you will eventually find the people on campus who also do. You might find those people in the first week or it might take some time, but know that it is definitely possible.",

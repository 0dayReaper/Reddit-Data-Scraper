    "postText": "Hi everyone. I'm an admitted student for the class of 2027 with some questions about how important AP scores are for senior year. I'm currently signed up to take 4 AP exams this May but I'm concerned I won't do as well as my previous track record (five 5's and one 4). I think I can probably pull off 4's in AP Stats and AP Lit, but have almost zero course knowledge in AP Gov and AP CSP. I'll still end the year with straight A's in the classes themselves, but will Harvard rescind my offer of admission if I get 1's or 2's for those exams? Would that constitute a 'significant decline in academic performance' that could jeopardize my spot? Is it worth spending the next month cramming and trying to get higher scores? \n\nI'm especially worried about the AP CSP make task - I haven't had a real teacher in that class since November and we really have learned nothing over the entire year. I literally cannot make an app. Can I even just skip that exam? Or do you guys have any resources I could use to do a crash course in Javascript and push out a 2-worthy app? \n\nClearly, I'm a little anxious so any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

You could get all 1s and it would make not one bit of difference.  \n\nA 5 on a language exam fulfills the foreign language requirement.  \n\nCalc can be helpful to pick a math course but no more helpful then the required placement exam you\u2019ll take.\n\nThe 5 on the Econ AP exams can get you into a more advanced class. \n\nOther than that there is no reason to take any exam.",

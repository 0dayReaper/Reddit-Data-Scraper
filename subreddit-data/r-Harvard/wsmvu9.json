I\u2019ll have Tuesdays and Thursdays mostly free, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s better to spread my classes out more.",

I\u2019d say the main thing you should be concerned with are due dates and exam dates. Make sure there isn\u2019t too much overlap because if you\u2019re looking at say 3 classes that have assignments each due Monday, then goodluck with your weekends my dude",

Honestly my favorite semester so far was Tuesdays and Thursdays off and all my other classes on MWF. I did the whole all classes on MTW and thursday fridays off and it made mondays hellish especially when I inevitably procrastinated on my homework because I had a long weekend",

To do that, I took whatever I had to leading up to that year with some pretty bad schedules. But I always tried to have a lighter end of the week.",

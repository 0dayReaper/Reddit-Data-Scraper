    "postText": "Hello,I just finished 124 and did really poorly on the final and my grade took a nosedive. My GPA as a whole has tanked this sophomore year. I'm curious what people's experiences are with their GPA's and its effect on recruiting. I have some extenuating circumstances so I definitely have an explanation but I still can't help but feel super disappointed and worried.  \n\n\nThanks for the replies in advance",

My experience was either \"do these leetcode/design problems and we'll hire you if you do sufficiently well\" (when interviewing for jobs in major metro areas) or \"wow you went to Harvard, when do you want to start?\" (when interviewing for jobs elsewhere).",

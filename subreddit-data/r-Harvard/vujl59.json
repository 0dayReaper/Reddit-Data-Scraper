    "postText": "I\u2019m feeling really overwhelmed by the breadth of courses offered and honestly don\u2019t even know where to start with deciding what to take. I\u2019m a prospective gov major but also very interested in cs possibly as a joint or a secondary or through the gov data science track.\n\nI was thinking some combination of: a seminar or expos depending on where i get assigned, a gov class, a cs class, and maybe a gen ed or language?\n\nAny tips on either specific classes you\u2019d recommend or just advice on navigating course selection would be greatly appreciated.",

I don\u2019t know if there are any other gov classes that freshman usually takes since I\u2019m not a gov concentrator. Expos or frosh sem are easier to pick so I think you know what to do there. Last class can either be a gened, language, or math class if you have to fulfill any requirements for a joint concentration. Thus, a prospective freshman fall schedule for you could be Gov 20, CS50, Frosh Seminar/Expos, Language/Gened.",

            "comment": "I understand the anxiety of starting college, but picking courses for freshmen (especially when you have an idea of what you want to do) is ultimately pretty simple. Don\u2019t overthink it. \n\nTake CS50 and Gov 20 for starters. Your other possible 2 courses could be:\n\n- a gened and seminar\n- a math course and seminar \n- a math course and gened  \n- a language and math course, seminar, or gened. \n\nThe other 2 courses you choose won\u2019t really matter too much. You have 4 years to fulfill the reqs. Just take what interests you. \n\nOtherwise, here\u2019s my hot take: seminars are overrated.",

            "comment": "I am biased, but I don't think anyone's been worse off for having taken more math courses. Especially if you like math and are willing to put in some effort, try Math 25 (you don't need to have been part of the competition circuit or having extensive experience with proofs) or Math 23, if you think it's too much. If you're looking for something perhaps more directly relevant to your expressed concentration interests, consider Stat 110. Joe Blitzstein is great.",

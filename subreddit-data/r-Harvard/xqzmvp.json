Construction is going on now, so I don\u2019t know if that makes a difference, but it didn\u2019t recognize my card at either the main entrance or the accessible entrance. I asked a kid I know who\u2019s a guide for Crimson Key what the deal is. He said that Annenberg is the only place on campus open to undergraduates that serves a full hot breakfast, so it\u2019s open to all UGs for breakfast only, but it\u2019s limited to UGs.",

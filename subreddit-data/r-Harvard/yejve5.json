Tatte has a second floor that often has room, but in general they're both packed.  \n\nGoing a little wider, the Peets Coffee by HKS has tables and outlets.  Darwins on Putnam (RIP Petsi Pies), Darwins on Cambridge and Broadsheet on Kirkland are also good choices.  \n\nMy personal favorite:  The atrium and cafe in the Fogg museum.  Its pretty quiet, the space is stunning, and the espresso is above average for Boston.",

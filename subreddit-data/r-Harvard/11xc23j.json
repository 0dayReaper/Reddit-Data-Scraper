    "postText": "Hello! I'm an incoming freshman, and I'm currently exploring freshmen housing options in advance, and was wondering if anyone had any advice on filling out the housing questionnaire. Looking back, is there anything that you wish you had answered differently or included on the questionnaire? Any advice or insights on this topic would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAdditionally, I'm particularly interested in hearing from anyone who was placed in Grays House. What type of responses did you provide on the questionnaire, and what qualities do you think they were looking for in a Grays House student?\n\nAny insights or advice on this topic would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance.",

Could you expand more on what you mean by no control over your dorm? I thought that was for upperclassmen housing, and that freshmen housing was more personalized, and that the Dean read through each survey.",

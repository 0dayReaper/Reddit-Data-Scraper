    "postText": "My flatmate and I (incoming master students) secured an apartment through the Harvard Housing lottery whose lease starts three weeks before our visas start. Is it possible to ask HUH to delay the start date (and pay less)? If not, how easy is it to sublet the apartment for 1 month? That must be the situation for many lessees so I guess that getting someone to sublease for that amount of time is incredibly rare.",

    "postText": "Good afternoon everyone! \nI\u2019m an incoming graduate student, and want to ensure that on the day-to-day I\u2019m not over dressing or underdressing, how would you describe the average way students dress? \n\nAt my undergraduate university business casual was the norm within my program.\n\nTo be clear I\u2019m not trying to impress anyone, I really just want to blend in and not look messy, or conversely look like I\u2019m trying too hard. If business casual is the norm, I\u2019m happy to do it, but if I can wear jeans, my new sweatshirt I just ordered from the coup, and my berks around campus, that\u2019s fine too.  \n\nThanks for the help!",

A few deans or central admin folks may wear business formal attire, but most profs dress casual or business casual, and students generally dress casual. You may get a very few older male profs that wear a sport coat.\n\nThere will be slightly more formal dress in the law school or the business school, and less formal in FAS or SEAS.",

But I don\u2019t want to look like a parody of how Hollywood says Ivy League people dress lol \n\nMy second question is when I do go casual is it normal to wear Harvard stuff?

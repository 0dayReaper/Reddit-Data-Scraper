    "postText": "I am a recent admit into HGSE\u2019s Human Development and Education Ed.M program. After attending the Open House this week, I\u2019ve gotten a better idea of how I might like to spend my time here, should I enroll\u2014but I would love to hear perspectives from any current or former students!\n\nSome questions\u2026\n\n1) The length of the program is only one year (full-time). How did you make the most of that time? Do you feel that the relationships you made with faculty and other students \u201cstuck?\u201d \n\n2) For students interested in developing their quantitative and qualitative research chops, do the available data analysis and research methods courses provide more than an introductory overview?\n\n3) How did you incorporate applied practice during your program via internships, research, jobs etc.? Did it feel that there was not only proximity to professional development and networking opportunities, but actual *availability* of those opportunities (or are there a ton of \u201clottery-based\u201d classes e.g.)?\n\n4) What helped you determine that an Ed.M was the right degree pathway for you? I am torn considering between this program and one in social work and policy. They both would be conducive to my social impact career goals\u2014albeit in different ways\u2014and I worry that one year would provide more limited opportunities to adjust, make relationships, and learn new skills. But maybe I\u2019m being too pessimistic?\n\n5) What are the ways you engaged with Harvard beyond HGSE?\n\n6) Any other advice for incoming HGSE students more generally?",

            "comment": "Congratulations on being admitted! Current HGSE Student, but in the Education Policy Analysis ('EPA') concentration. That said,\n\n1. There is a lot of FOMO 'Fear of Missing Out'. Many students take more than the required courseload, almost everyone tries to cross-register at other schools (frequently its with MIT or at HKS/HBS). Time flies. It's so intense and HGSE cohorts are naturally so outgoing and supportive (it's a lot of people passionate about education, so naturally a lot of positivity) - so yes, making bonds has been quite easy for everyone. Professors are highly welcoming, too. I just partook in a series HGSE has called '3D Dinners', where volunteering HGSE students are paired up with professors (ranked by their preference) then have dinner with that professor either at their home or a restaurant. Each professor has a theme for their dinners, relevant of course to their own research interests. Mine was a dinner debate about the role of standardized tests in higher ed admissions - loved it.\n2. There were a lot of lottery-based classes unfortunately, but the good news is that isn't mutually exclusive to having plenty of opportunities to incorporate applied practice. I've taken more classes than required for graduation precisely because of these opportunities. For class projects, I've gotten to complete consulting projects and presentations before BPS's administration (Boston Public School District), non-profit startups, I've had former big-name university presidents as regular guests in higher education classes, engaged in Q&amp;A with countless incumbent congressmen. Granted - that that last one has happened almost entirely through cross-registration at HKS and HLS, although the US Secretary of Education Dr. Miguel Cardona did come to speak at HGSE last semester. But again, I'm speaking as someone concentrating in Education Policy Analysis with an emphasis on Higher Education policy - I can't speak to you OP on how Human Development might see applying practice differently.\n3.

I've taken more classes than required for graduation precisely because of these opportunities. For class projects, I've gotten to complete consulting projects and presentations before BPS's finance administration (Boston Public School District) and consulting collaborations with local non-profit startups, I've had former big-name university presidents as regular guests in higher education classes, even engaged in countless on-campus and remote meetings with incumbent congressmen. Granted - that that last one has happened almost entirely through cross-registration at HKS and HLS, although the US Secretary of Education Dr. Miguel Cardona did come to speak at HGSE last semester. But again, I'm speaking as someone concentrating in Education Policy Analysis with an emphasis on Higher Education policy - I can't speak to you OP on how Human Development might see courses applying practice differently. Some warranted criticism on course registration is that, while the course catalog is limitless, the 1-year nature of it means you do have way less flexibility on course enrollment. Moreover, the course lottery system can be arbitrary and frustrating. But perhaps it's the fairest method we have for popular \n4. The program is fantastic for people who want to develop their quantitative and qualitative research chops. Right from the time you step foot on campus, there is rich and abundant courses that focus precisely on research methods. And even the ones addressed on other topics, HGSE does great incorporates plenty of opportunities to practice research methods and scaffold more research analytical methods. However, it is challenging to find research methods outside of the classroom and you're rather left to your own devices as far that goes.to rapidly find an employer after graduation because of circumstances tied to their visas. All that criticism of the program duration aside, its intensity does add value in being so much more immersive and encapsulating. This Ed.M. is my second graduate degree, my first being an MPA 2-year program - so I say I dare say this with credibility - it's the cohort that makes the difference. Maybe this is more of a point of HGSE's value than it is of EdM, but HGSE is made up of some of the most intrinsically supportive, accomplished-but-humble, brave, and collaborative people I've ever met. I'll spare the benefits of my MPA degree, but note its drawbacks being that degree type attracts more egos and competitive sort of applicants than it does humble characters. Beyond the cohort discussion, the professors at HGSE are generally super polite, inclusive, and amazingly accomplished in their respective niches. Because I'm an EdM candidate with an EPA (policy) focus, and someone who has an MPA, both simply being alternative language for 'public policy', I can't say there was a whole lot difference in curriculum compared to my first-grad degree, and my comparison thereby narrows to comparisons of universities (the other being the University of Washington in Seattle). Despite the aforementioned duration criticism, I will say HGSE was comparatively better at implementation. Professors range widely in their teaching style, and not every course has been perfect, but HGSE altogether has engaging classes full of so many simulations and chances to collaborate with its cohorts of amazing individuals and accomplished professors.\n5. I've really dived too deep into the maximum number of credits and consequently lack the daylight hours for internships, but I know a few students that do manage to squeeze in internships. I do find my MIT finance and both of my HLS classes more time-consuming than my HGSE classes. That said, I'm a history fanatic at Harvard's campus is so rich in history. Cambridge itself is an international city full of experts (professors and students) with highly-accomplished specializations in their respective areas, all from different corners of the entire planet, and all concentration in a triangle between Harvard, MIT, and Tufts. It's truly the Athens of America. I'm not alone in being one of the many HGSE students with intentions of staying in Cambridge post-graduation because of how historically charming and global-influentially that places like Harvard Square always give you a sense of. I  love Cambridge; I'm from Seattle but my roommate is from LA and can't stand the weather or cultural adjustment of the Boston metro. He's a car guy, and Cambridge best serves pedestrians and the subway system. He's also a guy who likes to go clubbing, and Cambridge's nightlife is more in its pub culture, although there is still plenty of dancing at the local concerts, karaoke, and some seasonal outdoor venues. I think Cambridge is paradise, but my roommate exemplifies that is not for everyone.\n6. Equip yourself with the mindset that this experience will assuredly result in you forming lifelong bonds and friendships with your cohort. When you start the program, you might be overwhelmed at keeping track of the countless driven and accomplished people you're meeting for the first time - know that many of these people won't be strangers for too long, and some might become meaningful friends somewhere along the life-changing experience that is HGSE.  \n\n\nHGSE admits, now and readers looking at this in the future, feel free to DM me to discuss the HGSE experience. I hope I showed the tradeoffs above. It's a challenging but meaningful experience. I could not imagine having matriculated into the other grad programs I had also applied to when I applied to HGSE. This experience has been positively life-changing.",

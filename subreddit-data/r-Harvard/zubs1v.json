Does anyone have a recommendation for somewhere safe with a low likelihood of theft/vandalism in the $300-450/month range?\n\nPlease save the \u201cget rid of your car statements.\u201d I require a car for disability related mobility issues.",

It\u2019s usually super hard to get but you might be able to apply for the accessibility spots. In terms of parking off campus:\n\n(1) street parking is 25 bucks a year through the city. The areas near the law school have very low vandalism or car break ins. However, people do get things stolen when they leave cars unlocked overnight or if they drive a Toyota Priuses with unprotected catalytic converters. \n(2) if you\u2019re looking for housing off campus, you can also specifically look for apartments with off street parking. It\u2019s usually 150-300 bucks a month depending on the building",

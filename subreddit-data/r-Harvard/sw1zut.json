Regret is a lot of wasted energy and needless suffering. We all make the best choices we can with the information we have and we can never know if other choices would have fared better. All you have is right now, so try to make the right now the very best. Do something everyday that brings some joy to your world and focus on appreciating anything that makes you feel good \u2014 it can be as small as a good sandwich! When you focus your emotional energy on what\u2019s happening right now, it doesn\u2019t have time to get lost in past decisions. Glad you posted your feelings. So important to just recognize where you\u2019re at.",

When CAMHS is booked months out and the resources I do have access to would not be able to help me, like AEO, or my resident dean who would tell me to take a leave of absence (which I already did), it leaves me feeling stuck and lost. And transferring would be silly and potentially impossible when I have a year left.\n\nAcademics is not the problem- I'm going to grad school when I graduate. My professors tell me that Harvard is unique for their environment and not all academic environments are like this. \n\nI was just making a post about my current feelings. I know it's something I am just going to have to ride out but it felt good to say somewhere that I have these feelings",

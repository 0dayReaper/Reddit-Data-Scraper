The websites don't seem to have any calendars or options to add myself to a mailing list. How do I keep track of events happening across campus? Feels like everything spreads through the grapevine.",

            "comment": "Unfortunately, there is no one source for *all* events at the University or even within the College/FAS. \n\nDepartments can submit their events to the Gazette's [Harvard Events](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/harvard-events/) calendar. It doesn't look like there's an email subscription for it but digging around in the code, there is an RSS feed, https://www.trumba.com/calendars/gazette.rss. RSS is great but if you don't use it, google for a service that converts RSS feeds into emails. I will note that this particular feed is annoying because library and museum exhibits that are up for months will have an entry for every damn day.\n\nI don't know how many departments submit events to the College's calendar, [calendar.college.harvard.edu](https://calendar.college.harvard.edu). If you click the \"Resources\" button there, there's a Build an Email Digest feature that will email you events. If you click Filters, there's a Subscribe to Results section with links for Google Calendar, iCalendar, and RSS (I didn't check but I suspect these will not include events that require signing in with HarvardKey to see).\n\nMany departments to list events on their website, [Philosophy](https://philosophy.fas.harvard.edu) lists upcoming ones right on their home page. Philosophy hosts their site on the most popular platform at Harvard, OpenScholar (look for the Powered by OpenScholar logo in the footer). Any OpenScholar site that lists events will have a /calendar page and on that page is an \"Export\" button; there are iCalendar (aka \"subscribe\"), RSS, and Google (Calendar) options.",

(Probably a Snopes.)\n\nWell it's incumbent upon us to put it back. As the resident Oxonian of the subreddit (or Jeffersonian if you prefer), I feel I should commission the plaque. But I live down South. So I'll have to mail it to you, and it's up to you to install it.\n\nAre you comfortable with drilling and screwing into brick to make a future plaque more tamper proof, or do you want to just use an adhesive like liquid nails?",

    "postText": "This year has def been difficult with applying to college but I just feeling like I have no real motivation to work in my ECs or academics even when I want to do well. Unfortunately, I got like 2 B's first semester and probably 3 more this one so I might even get rescinded on top of it.\n\nI have a few ideas why I might be feeling this way... Although I thought of college just as a stepping stone, I'm wondering if subconsciously the pressure of \"making it\" has lifted off me. I also had a literal existential crisis and feel like I have no purpose in life that matters and genuinely accepted the absurdity of life after reading Albert Camus. As dumb as it sounds, hope is a fundamental pillar of one's humanity and Im not just sure how to do it anymore.\n\nIs it normal to feel this way and do you gain more motivation at college?",

I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ll get rescinded over B\u2019s based on the experiences of my friends and other people asking questions in this sub, but someone else can correct me if I\u2019m wrong.",

Soon you'll get your excitement and motivation back as you enter the next phase in life and see how many new opportunities there are to explore at college!",

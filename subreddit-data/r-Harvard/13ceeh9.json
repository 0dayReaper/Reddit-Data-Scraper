    "postText": "I am an incoming postdoc and just got a 3B Peabody terrace apartment. Is anyone live in Peabody before? Is it good or bad in general? \n\nAnd my lease actually starts from today and none will move in till early July. So is it easy to sublet Huh apartment during May and June? And do I have to use HUH sublet platform?",

            "comment": "peabody is pretty good.  the location is killer, you're right on the river, the units are well thought out and filled with natural light.  concrete can be surprisingly soft.  if you land a garden terrace 3br or one of the 3brs in the low buildings they're the best units in cambridge, imho.  full kitchen and bathroom remodels done only a few years ago.  superb on site childcare if you have kids.  \n\ndownsides are no built in overhead lights (you need a lot of lamps), no ac, skip stop elevator floors mean moving might be a pain.  huh is --constantly-- doing maintenance which is a good thing but when i lived there it meant concrete drilling promptly at 7am for almost 6 months straight.   shared steam heat, the pipes can clank.  \n\nno idea about subletting, sorry!",

Which means that a criminal is sitting in our lobby with a knife.",

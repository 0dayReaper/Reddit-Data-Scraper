    "postText": "I\u2019m a student who is going to be attending classes during the 7 week summer session. Unfortunately, housing got full before I could register so I will end up having to live off campus. Does anyone know any apartments that I could get a 3 month lease for that are either walking distance to campus or where I could have easy access to public transportation to campus? Ideally, I want the least expensive possible but at this point what matters most is accessibility and safety. Thanks in advance :)",

I've had a good experience with it, not sure about everyone but it seems alright so far. It gives you info on who is currently living there and it lets you vet new applicants once you live there. I got a place that's not too bad and close to harvard for under 1400.\n\nAlso, a lot of the leases are three month minimums I believe",

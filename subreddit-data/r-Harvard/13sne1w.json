I was talking to colleagues about applying to a support position in the department and was told in no uncertain terms to avoid the music department. I think there are probably a few factors contributing to that answer but certainly this confirms it to me. \n\nMany western classical music focused programs might have issues like this but I can imagine that Harvard has some aggravating qualities that make it this way.",

Harvard is a major research university and the faculty, as such, are expected to produce research. That's the focus for faculty because it's what the system for promotion and tenure incentivizes. The reality is that no one gets or keeps a faculty job at Harvard because they're good at teaching undergraduates. If faculty are distant or unwilling to engage in undergraduates its because they're protecting their time to do what will keep them in their jobs (eg publish, etc).\n\nIf you really want a department that commits to undergrads, the place for that is a small liberal arts college not a major research university.",

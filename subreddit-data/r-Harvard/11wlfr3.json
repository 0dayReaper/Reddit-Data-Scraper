    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI\u2019m taking the plunge and have accepted admittance to grad school this fall. Besides all the worry of financial stuff, I\u2019m pretty excited for this awesome opportunity! \n\nQuestions:\n1. I\u2019m from the southwest with mild winters, how are winters in MA? \n\n2. I\u2019m thinking of driving, epic road trip! I want to have a car there so I can explore New England. Pros/cons? Like will I need to register with MA? \n\n3. School culture - what can I expect? I\u2019m really laid back, and love to meet people\u2014 are people friendly? \n\n4. On campus or off campus housing? Was looking at the HU site for apartments, they are expensive. I also don\u2019t want roommates or to stay in a dorm - I\u2019m an older student who has had my share of that! \n\n5. Elitism \u2014 how will I fit in as a middle/low income teacher? Are there Walmarts around? Lol\n\n6. Best places to visit around Boston or to eat. My fam will probably come at some point would like to recommendations to get true east coast experience. \n\n7. Down time\u2014 how much down time should I expect as a grad student? \n\n8. Any other tips or advice! Thanks!",

It's not out of the question though just make sure to stay on top of the parking situation because somerville/cambridge can be brutal with ticketing) It would be best if you could find a place with a driveway/on site parking but those are rarer. You will have to register your car as well as switch insurance if you decide to bring your car. Also fyi it's called the RMV here and not the DMV\n3. Chill, especially in grad school. Lots of very different and cool people.\n4. There are pros and cons to both. I have a friend who lived on campus in the grad dorms and LOVED it. She eventually became an RA so saved a TON of money in grad school. \n5. People come from all sorts of backgrounds and I haven't really experienced elitism. There aren't walmarts around (i think the closest one is like 15ish miles away). \n6. Yo check back later because this list is way too long.\n7. This depends on your project/mentor as well as what you plan on doing after grad school. If you want to go into academia then your grad school productivity expectations are higher.\n8. Do what you want to do! Try not to tie yourself down to projects or ideas or people or places if it doesn't sit right with you. Have fun, learn, enjoy the journey, don't work too hard and burn out, STAY HEALTHY",

Basically you\u2019ll be fine. \n2 hard no, dawg. The driving itself is HELLACIOUS and Boston refuses to have organized streets with proper signage. We literally built many of our roads by paving over the cow paths.  On top of this, Boston drivers (self included) are notoriously aggressive assholes and Cambridge driving is like playing a game of frogger against cyclists and students who aren\u2019t paying attention. Then there\u2019s the parking which SUCKS. For most trips it is faster to bike than to drive and then park. Car will bring more stress than benefit IMHO. \n3 yeah amongst grad students pretty much\n4 bruh, housing here is absurd. You\u2019ll be lucky to find an apartment let alone to live without roommates. Boston has an endless demand for housing and very limited supply. Start your search RIGHT NOW. It is NORMAL to pay 4 months upfront just to get keys (first last security and on refundable broker fee even though the broker doesn\u2019t do anything). Good luck. It\u2019s brutal. Prepare yourself accordingly. Like seriously.  It\u2019s bad. Don\u2019t think you can have a list of \u201cdemands\u201d or \u201cwants\u201d you\u2019ll get what ya get. If it\u2019s a roof and safe, it\u2019s all good. \n5 the elitism can be not great. There are no Walmarts close by (I mean Saugus or Lynn\u2026.)\n6 there is no true East coast experience. Take them to the places you enjoy and discover. Thinking \u201cthey need AUTHENTIC clam chowder\u201d e.g. is just a recipe for eating at tourist traps. Especially in Cambridge there\u2019s so much good food dozens of almost every cuisine and nationality from Andean to Tibetan. \n7 down time? Nah. Work is like a gas and will expand to fill any volume you give it. So set limits for yourself that make sense \n8 I love Boston and East Coast. The people are great but don\u2019t have an initial \u201cmidwestern nice\u201d vibe. I think folks are a bit more standoffish here until they get to know you so don\u2019t get startled by that. It\u2019s not meannness it\u2019s just affect. \n\nCongrats and good luck. Hope you love it here!",

            "comment": "Congrats! I am also moving this summer to start grad school at SPH. But I\u2019m moving from maine where the winter is harsher. You want some snow boots and a good parka. Parking is a nightmare. Rent is insane if you aren\u2019t going to have roommates. Keep in mind that student housing looks expensive (it is) but that it is inclusive of utilities. So keep that in mind when you\u2019re comparing it to things on craigslist. Also, if you rent through student housing, then you won\u2019t have to pay brokerage fees, which can usually equal about one months rent, so that\u2019s another huge added expense.   I have been going through this whole process myself learning how housing works and figuring out where to rent.  There is a target right near campus in Porter square but it\u2019s really tiny.  If you can get away with no car consider it. Paying to keep a car in the city just so that you can go away once in a while on the weekends may not be worth it. The cost of renting a car for the weekend might be better for you.",

It was $100 for the academic year compared to $1000+ for Harvard so well worth it for the occasional road trips. In Quincy house we have 2 hour street parking that got me over $500 in tickets so either buy a Harvard spot or get a garage nearby. Was worth it though in my specific situation since I got to explore all of Massachusetts and drive to nearby states to see friends or like go to six flags\n\nAlso yes you do need to register with MA, Its super easy and also get an EZ Pass or equivalent scanner for tolls since they cause a headache without one. Harvard might have a policy for freshman and cars but I think that's just for dorming\n\nAlso driving here is 100% better than where I'm from. I hate coming back home and having to put up with the drivers. You haven't met aggressive until you've driven in Florida.",

I have met so many lovely people, but it honestly depends so much on the program and even more so, the department. \n\n4. For what you want, off campus, but it\u2019s not easy. Probably worth getting a broker since you\u2019ll pay brokers fees either way. \n\n5. As a first generation lower/working class thirty something: you\u2019ll encounter snobs and legacies and you\u2019ll learn to avoid them (and they\u2019ll avoid you). You\u2019ll be perfectly happy and oblivious when you find your own tribe. Stuff is expensive in Harvard square ngl but if you can budget you\u2019ll be ok. \n\n6. I got nothing, nor really a foodie, I\u2019m sorry. \n\n7. You are here because you deserve to be here. It will be frustrating, rewarding, stressful, bewildering, lovely. Take advantage of all the free Harvard stuff you can\u2014milk EVERY grant and fellowship and scholarship you can. Make them pay for your desk chair if you can. And have fun. It\u2019s actually a cool place. Also, there is a very real cultural, experiential, and overall \u201cvibe\u201d difference between grads and undergrads. Don\u2019t fight it. These aren\u2019t your college years and that\u2019s ok. There\u2019s cool stuff for you too. \n\nFeel free to DM if you have questions, or would like to go for a coffee when you get to Cambridge.",

This winter has been mostly high 30\u2019s in the morning and 40\u2019s in the afternoon.  Downtown Boston is a wind tunnel though if you plan on venturing beyond Cambridge. \n\nParking can be $$.  Check Harvard garage rates on the Harvard Transportation web site.  There are beautiful places to see in New England but you could rent a zip car for that.  All this depends on your financial situation. \n\nAll rentals around this area are stupid $$$.  Sure, you can find some fleabag basement apartment for less money but the advantage of the on-campus graduate housing (if you can get it) is no broker fee, no security deposit, first and last month aren\u2019t required up front, and utilities are included.  GSAS and Harvard Housing have apartments.  The GSAS apartments can be downright trashy though.\n\nWalmarts?  Not really anything close, but there are Targets. Have you thought about opening a map and doing some research on grocery stores, pharmacies, etc?\n\nAs far as Eliteism?  It\u2019s Harvard.  Small condo\u2019s sell for $1M.  Every other person drives a Tesla.  Biotech money is flush, but Central square (on the red line and close-ish to campus) has a lot of homeless peoples.  In the schools, yeah, there is Eliteism, but there is an okay cross-sampling of people so you can find other middle income midwesterners or likeminded people too.  It\u2019s just not going to be served to you on a platter - you have to work at it. \n\nOpen TripAdvisor for food recommendations. Seriously. Food and opinions go hand in hand. I honestly don\u2019t know what defines \u201cNew England\u201d dining. We have many of the same food chains as anywhere else.  There are plenty of high-end local places in Cambridge/Boston but I would not call the food regionally specific.",

Getting a street permit means registering your car with MA DMV and changing insurance. Only bring a car if you plan on living outside of the city centre or desperately need it.\n3. Varies from school to school. Generally the social scene at Harvard is poor compared to most universities. However, you will make friends and it will be fun.\n4. On campus housing is more convenient and landlords are predatory in Boston. Cheaper options will exist as you move out of the centre.\n5. You will find likeminded people and I wouldn\u2019t worry about this too much. \n6. Compared to the southwest - food sucks here. People will say to get a lobster roll or oysters but it\u2019s pricey. North end has great Italian food. Not NY, but good.\n7. Depends on program but generally a lot.\n8. Public transport is not good so really think about where you will live.\nDM me for more information from a fellow slightly older grad student.",

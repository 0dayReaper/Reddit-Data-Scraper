            "comment": "I think dorms are decent, not fancy mattresses amazing, but decently okay. I have a large single with basically two walls of ceiling to floor windows. Food is getting better but definitely something many students will complain about. Stress levels are high depending on what you\u2019re studying/planning to do, but I would assume the same of schools of equal academic rigor. Fun level depends on who you\u2019re hanging out with, you\u2019ll definitely find your people! School spirit is low unless it\u2019s Harvard-Yale. There will be some pretty terrible cutthroat awful people and they\u2019re easy to identify and avoid but also some really amazing, kind, caring, fun people and you\u2019ll find the crowds you\u2019re looking for eventually! A lot of weekend partying is centered around student groups, roommate/friend parties, and final club things, some are listed some are open. Many will also go to mit for frat parties.",

I would say that it's usually stress from classes and extracurriculars, which will just be what you choose to take/comp. You could take really easy classes + join chill clubs which will be fairly easy on you, but there are also people that are taking really challenging classes and joining really work-heavy/competitive comp clubs that are enjoying it nonetheless.",

The visits made the decision clear that Harvard had the vibe she was hoping for. We stopped to ask random students questions and everyone was super friendly and willing to chat, too.",

            "comment": "I actually switched into bio *and* went vegan while at the College, so I can recommend Harvard on both counts!\n\nAcademically, the strong curriculum and institutional support (including summer funding) for doing world-class research as an undergrad are big pros. Cons are that you need to be proactive to stand out from your similarly impressive classmates and get into smaller upper-level classes and interesting labs where you can actually interact with faculty, and you do want to ask around when picking a research lab to make sure you don't get vacuumed up by one of the PIs who notoriously exploit eager undergrads for cheap labor. I imagine these considerations are similar at Yale.\n\nOn the other hand, I'd say that HUDS (Harvard University Dining Services) performs far above replacement level in terms of providing several edible-to-excellent vegan options at each meal. They're very proactive about centering attractive plant-based options throughout cafeterias for climate and sustainability reasons, and if you ever find the entr\u00e9es subpar you can ask for a vegan burger to order.",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t think Yale has a biology major. I could be wrong about this though. Also, I\u2019m a rising first-year, who is picking Harvard over Yale, so take my opinions with a grain of salt. \n\nAnyway, Harvard is one of, if not, the best universities for biology in the nation. If you\u2019re looking to do premed or anything of that nature, Harvard\u2019s med school placement rate is amazing (98-100% of undergrads get into a med school). I\u2019m sure Yale\u2019s med school placement rate is also pretty good, though, and their biology education is probably just as good as Harvard's. \n\nFor housing, all first-years are required to live on campus, usually in The Yard. After that, you will be randomly sorted into one of the 12 residential houses where you will spend your remaining three years at Harvard. I believe Yale has a similar procedure as Harvard for housing as well.\n\nI can\u2019t speak too much about the food yet since I\u2019m a rising first-year, but from what I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s pretty average. There\u2019s nothing too special about it, but you get unlimited meal swipes unlike the limited number of meal swipes at Yale. First-years usually eat at Annenberg Dining Hall, but you can eat at other houses if you get swiped in by an upperclassman. After your first year, you will usually eat at your house\u2019s respective dining hall, so the food is a little better, but you\u2019re still free to eat at other houses if you get swiped in. There are a few vegan options for those who need them, and you can always check out the general menu [here](http://www.foodpro.huds.harvard.edu/foodpro/menu_items.asp?type=30&amp;meal=1).\n\nOverall, I don\u2019t think you can go wrong with either Harvard or Yale, so it comes down to personal preference and whether you like Cambridge/Boston more than New Haven.",

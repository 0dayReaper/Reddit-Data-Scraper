The reason I ask is that I am an RA in two labs at my university and combining both for my undergrad thesis.",

Culture and many policies come from the department, so it things like that don't generalize well across FAS, let alone across the university.\n\nAt least for PhD students, GSAS policy does allow co-advising, potentially including time spent outside of the department or school (e.g., at MIT or one of the hospitals). How much support you get from your department for doing this may be another matter.",

Some departments guarantee more. The terms of that funding, such as balance of RA vs. TA vs. no-strings, may vary a lot by department and individual.\n\nIf you are US citizen or PR, securing outside funding like NSF GRFP, DoD NDSEG, etc. gives you a lot more freedom.",

I think a couple might field you to TF for them, otherwise they just pay so that you arent being \u201cdistracted by teaching\u201d.  the grad scholarships are nice to have for your resume, but you dont get paid any more and you are no more or less likely to have autonomy on your project.",

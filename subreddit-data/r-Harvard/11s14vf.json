    "postText": "Hi, everyone,\n\nFirst time posting. Got admitted and just wanted to ask you guys for some tips and pointers on how I can take advantage of the socializing aspect of Harvard. I'm a pretty quiet person as a whole but I figured that will have to change. What club/ events/ areas should I look into or how would you go about it.\n\nKnowing myself i'd probably ended up curling into a ball a coffee shop and make no real connection in all the years I'll study here and just.. glaze through it without making any meaningful relationship. It seems daunting, i don't want that.\n\nI've read the brochure and search all the infos i can on my own, but i'd really love to hear some hard-core personal tips. I'd really appreciate some personal experiences as well.\n\nThank you",

Biggest things are just show up to freshman entryway events and in Annenberg take advantage of the first few months where you can sit next to anyone and people will be friendly &amp; want to meet you. Say yes to everything (parties, grabbing late night food, working in Lamont) and invite people to come with you when you do any of those things too. You won\u2019t be close friends with everyone you meet but eventually you\u2019ll find your people.\n\nFor clubs I recommend in general trying a bunch at first but narrowing to 1-2 that you really want to spend time with. I ended up joining like 5 light commitment ones my freshman fall (fell victim to the Harvard well roundedness/want a position for everything trap) and as a result didn\u2019t really get to know anyone. If the club takes a lot of time from its members (eg Crimson, Model UN, acapella, etc) you\u2019ll inherently get close with people there. The cultural affinity groups throw a lot of events and parties too. Also all of the high commitment clubs throw parties so you\u2019ll get to invite your entrywaymates or friends to come with you!\n\nAlso the freshmen pset classes are a great way to build late night memories with other people - CS50, any math entry level class, LS1a, etc",

            "comment": "The other comment gave great advice, I second finding 1 or 2 extracurricular groups that require higher commitment so you can use it to meet people in depth.\n\nThe other thing I wanted to add is that consistency is key to converting people from acquaintances to friends. If you can set a routine with someone, like eating at the same time, or being gym buddies at X time every week, or having a study group for a certain course, they\u2019ll likely become more consistent and reliable friends. For example in my year, there were a few people that always ate at Annenberg around 7:30/8am (earlier than most people when few others are around), and their breakfast table became a solid blocking group. You\u2019ll probably find that with some classes and schedules you\u2019ll be eating meals at the same times/dates with similar people.",

Or if you finish getting food and don\u2019t see any acquaintances, just pick a table with 2-4 people talking and ask \u2018hey do you mind if I join your table? I don\u2019t know anyone around\u2019. Introduce yourself, ask them about classes etc. People won\u2019t find this weird in the first 2-3 months of school.\n\nI\u2019d also recommend trying to make friends with people in the entryway, so before you go for a meal, ask around your dorm to see if anyone else is headed that way. Or hang out in an entryway\u2019s common room (depending on the building style).",

            "comment": "Ok as general advice, I've known a few people who did college \"wrong.\" (My opinion.) By wrong I mean they thought college is about academics. So they stayed in, studied hard, kept their noses to the grindstone and ACED college with killer grades. What they DIDN'T do was live, make friends, have big crazy experiences. \nWhen they were out of college for several years, they came to realize all the B- and C students they'd known were farther along in life than them. They figured out the reason why was because as the old saying goes, it's not what you know, it's WHO you know. And how you form lifelong bonds with people is to have big experiences together, grow together and learn things about yourselves together. \nSome students come in with this plan that they're going to network heavily...but in my experience trying to network for the sake of networking never really works as well as organically just experiencing stuff together that forms natural and powerful bonds.\n\nSo more specific advice is don't try to meet people for the sake of meeting people but rather instead be intentional about putting yourself in situations where it's just more likely you are going to end up meeting people as a byproduct of the situation. Try everything. Join a bunch of clubs and athletic/recreational activities, but be okay with falling out of some of them that aren't for you. Get surprised by ones you never thought you'd be into but it turns out you are. Take a ballroom dancing lesson. Do learn-to-curl and learn-to-crew instructional sessions. Pop into the archery club and shoot (all equipment is provided! No obligation to compete! You can do it just for fun with zero pressure.) Go to ballgames. Boo Yale at every opportunity. Talk to a stranger at Grendel's. Compliment somebody in the Queen's Head. Ask for help when you're lost. When the red line is unexpectedly closed, call an Uber at 2am and ask the one other complete stranger, \"you need a ride too?\"\nGet out of your comfort zone (but always follow your gut about being safe.) Outside of your comfort zone is where all the growth happens.\nThere is no model you have to measure up to and no blueprint you must follow. Fail often and spectacularly. Be ok with falling on your face. It's how we learn best. Everyone's path through life is unique to them and that's okay. Everything you need to succeed, you already have.\n\nYou got this! Remember we only get one bite at the apple so make it count. I'm confident you'll really surprise yourself!",

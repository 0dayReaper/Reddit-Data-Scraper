    "postText": "This may be a silly question, but as an incoming PhD student this fall, I'm in the pre-matriculation excitement phase of wanting to get as prepared as possible, and am wondering how folks manage carrying all of their belongings around when they come to campus for class and whatnot. \n\nEspecially in the first year where I'll be in class most of my time (I imagine), are there grad student offices or lounges with fridges to throw your lunch into? Or do people invest in lunchboxes with lots of storage for ice packs and whatnot? \n\nWill I look crazy carrying around a big sports duffle bag to lug my gym stuff around with me, along with my books/laptop plus lunchbox? They don't have like, lockers or something comparable available to students, do they?\n\nAnd, semi-related while I'm thinking about the gym - does Harvard really make its grad students pay to use the facilities? My initial glance from the website tells me this is the case, but that can't be true, is it?! I'm currently wrapping up my Master's at another local university and have always had free access to the gym, but I know each institution does things differently.\n\nAre there printers on campus for those of us who prefer to read on paper over devices (don't worry, I recycle)? Do we have to pay to use them?\n\nAnd, what's your favorite/preferred location on campus to study or hole yourself up to do some work? As someone who's lived close enough to Cambridge for years to have seen the craziness that is Harvard Square, I know I haven't seen enough of the actual inner workings of the university, and imagine there are libraries and other spots around for students to gather, buckle down, and do their work.\n\nWould love to hear people's experiences/thoughts on any of these things, in addition to anything else you think an incoming grad student should know about!",

            "comment": "Congrats and welcome to HGSE! \n\nThe gym is free for PhD students. A locker to leave stuff overnight (toiletries and such) is $120/year. Worth it for me. But plenty of people carry around multiple bags so you won\u2019t seem out of place. \n\nHGSE just put in free daily lockers on the second floor of Gutman. No need for a lock as you set your combo in them. \n\nThere\u2019s a (small, windowless) doctoral lounge in the bottom floor of Larson with a fridge. I never use it but others do. I just have insulated containers for food that should stay cool. \n\nFor studying: I prefer to reserve a room in Gutman and study with a friend or two. Gutman can be loud, social, and distracting. I like being in the mix but able to wall myself off if needed. The second floor of Widner has a huge, SILENT room that is cool if you want to feel like you\u2019re a serious, Ivy League student. I\u2019ve heard the law school library is cool and maybe has free coffee. HKS has done beautiful spaces as well. The smith center is also nice for that more cafe, chaotic vibe. \n\nPro tips. Get a study group together early. If your a POC, I recommend the summer institute that they have. It\u2019s like two weeks of half days discussing various readings, taking tours of the campus, eating free food, and learning about the PhD process. And you get like $2k. The HGSE students that did it with me became my closest friends and my pro seminar study group. If you\u2019re not into stats, you CAN waive s052 with another course. Ask me about that if interested. \n\nWhich concentration are you?",

I definitely want to hear more about this summer institute; I\u2019m coming in with a Master\u2019s and have plenty of stats experience/coursework under the belt already, and would love to get that waived if possible. That time to get to know people and get $2k doesn\u2019t sound too shabby either! \n\nAnd, I\u2019m in the CIS concentration!",

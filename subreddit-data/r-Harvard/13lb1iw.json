Of course it's up to you how to spend your summer. If you do decide to do some advance preparation, you can check out the free resources I have at [stat110.net](https://stat110.net), especially the book and youtube lecture videos. \n\nOn campus the resources are even better, especially since we will have amazing TFs and you will hopefully either have some good friends (or make some new friends!) in the class to work with. In any case, I look forward to meeting you in the fall!",

            "comment": "First, I really hope that you're not spending your summer studying for Stat 110 because that would be depressing. \n\nSecond, I don't see any reason why you would need to study for Stat 110 before taking the class or for any academic class at Harvard for that matter. Especially since STAT 110 doesn't require a lot of prerequisite background other than single-variable calculus. This is coming from someone who studies Computer Science and just took CS124. \n\nThird, if you're looking for tips, I would say the most important thing is that you do lots of practice. There are a lot of resources in STAT 110, including an extremely well-written and clear textbook, which has a one-to-one-correspondence with the lecture plus more (because the professor wrote the book), additional practice problems from section notes, the textbook, and strategic practice, and an excessive number of practice tests provided for exams. \n\nIn terms of taking the class, I don't think there's a lot that you can overthink given how many resources that are provided. Read the textbook, going to lecture and section are recommended, and do lots of practice to get comfortable solving probability problems. The class is also not necessarily time consuming, and the workload is very reasonable. Grading also tends to be fair and even lenient compared to other classes. \n\nThe only daunting part about the course are the exams, but that could be said about many STEM classes at Harvard. To prepare for them, just make sure you do lots of practice, and keep note of general problem-solving strategies and mistakes. \n\nIn short, I really see no benefit in studying for STAT 110 over the summer if that's what you're looking to do. The course is a challenging  (not even close to the most challenging at Harvard though), but very reasonable.",

            "comment": "From [Globe.com](https://Globe.com):\n\nKatey Stone, who has coached the Harvard\u2019s women\u2019s hockey team since 1994, is retiring, the school announced Tuesday.\n\nStone\u2019s Crimson have made six Frozen Fours and four national title games, including a championship in 1999. She won nine Ivy League championships, 12 Beanpots, and coached Team USA in the 2014 Olympics.\n\nHarvard finished with a 7-21-3 record in 2023, only the second time it has won fewer than 10 games in a season since 1996.Stone was the subject of a Globe report that detailed wide-ranging abuse allegations, including hazing.\n\nThe Globe reported that Stone in 2022 uttered a racially insensitive comment in front of Indigenous members of the team, saying the team was playing as if there were \u201ctoo many chiefs and not enough Indians.\u201d\n\nTwo Indigenous players, Maryna MacDonald and Taze Thompson, later left the team, as did Sydney Daniels, an assistant coach with Indigenous roots. Daniels, a former Crimson captain who scouts for the NHL\u2019s Winnipeg Jets, filed a complaint against Harvard and its athletic department with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination.\n\nThe Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations called for Stone\u2019s resignation.\n\nThe other allegations involving Stone fall into wide-ranging categories, including denigrating players in ways that made them demoralized, anxious, or seeking mental health support; insensitivity to mental health issues; pressuring players to return from concussions and other injuries; body shaming; adversely influencing academics; and hazing.",

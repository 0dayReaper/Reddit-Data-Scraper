    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman and have experience in math up to IB Math HL. I am planning on concentrating in History of Science with a focus on Medicine &amp; Society. I also want to be on the pre-med track. Would starting out with Math 1b okay as a person wanting to be on the pre-med track? The concentration I want to pursue allows me to use Math 1b to also fulfill the major requirements but I wasn't sure if the class would be competitive/rigorous enough for medical school applications later on.",

            "comment": "I don't get what you mean by \"competitive/rigorous enough\" for medical school applications. Any college class that fulfills the requirements will be considered rigorous enough. 1b is the highest and only Calc II class that you can take at Harvard; plus, med schools will not look at if you took the hardest class in a subject; they'll care if you did well in those classes and fulfilled all the requirements. Plus, it's a math class. For med school, I'm pretty sure all you need is Calc. \n\nIn summary, taking Math 1b is obviously okay for pre-med.",

Hope you have a great summer!",

            "comment": "The vast majority of medical schools in the US do *not* require calculus: statistics is enough.  I am talking about regular medical school, not biomedical engineering. \n\nHarvard medical school is among the few that does require applicants to have taken some calculus (see https://www.theclassroom.com/medical-schools-require-calculus-8202483.html for others), so it's natural for pre-meds at Harvard to take calculus since many of them probably dream of going to Harvard for medical school too. But it's worth being aware that you can apply to all but a few medical schools with a college math coursework only in statistics. And note Harvard medical school's math requirement is a semester of calculus and a semester of (bio)statistics, so I wonder if placing out of Math 1a would count as satisfying the calculus part of the math requirement.",

My score breakdown when I took the MCAT on April 30th, 2022 was the following: CARS (128), Chemical and Physical Foundations (130), Biological and Biochemical Foundations (130), and Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior (128). Since then, I tutor at local public libraries and recently moved my services to zoom. I charge $25/hr (after 4-5 sessions more, then $20 for MCAT services) and $20/hr for medical school application revision and personal statement editing. Thanks!",

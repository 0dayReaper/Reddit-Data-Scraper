    "postText": "I\u2019m a rising freshman at Harvard planning to major in Econ and I\u2019m wondering which classes I should take my first semester. So far I have Math 1A, Econ 10A, a freshman seminar (hopefully lol) and I don\u2019t know what else to add because I was assigned Expos 20 in the spring. What does everyone else recommend for an easy course? Any core classes? Thanks!",

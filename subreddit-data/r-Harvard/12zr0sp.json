But DoD funding or not, Professors at research universities aim to publish as much of their work as possible (the old 'publish or perish'). In other words, they aim to make the results of their work public, as much as possible. In my experience, I've never seen any DoD funding at a university that required any form of secrecy. So, given that this guy is already screaming his results from the mountaintop for all to hear, what exactly do people think is happening here?\n\nEdit: Whoa, he got $50k per month from this (not sure if true- read on a comment on the /r/boston posting of this same article)? Thats crazy. But what did the Chinese actually get for their money? He has tons of expertise, but does he have any trade or government secrets or something? Again, university professors are doing their best to make the results known to get citations and prestige...",

He actually named it the WUT-Harvard Joint Nano Key Laboratory\" -- when H and the DoD asked him what was going on, as we had paid him $15M via the NIH and now he was ending up with $18M in grants given to him he for some reason said he'd never been asked to be a part of the thousand talents program.\n\nHe admitted to things [like bringing $20k in cash](https://cen.acs.org/research-integrity/misconduct/Harvard-Charles-Lieber-trial-China-daily-updates/99/web/2021/12?PageSpeed=noscript) back from China he never reported. There are a lot of these investigations happening right now (almost 200?), there are a few weird things going on:\n\n1. Double-dipping where the same science is being paid for multiple times by tax payers. e.g., they apply and receive funding to look at X from one place, then don't disclose it when applying to another.\n2. Access to confidential information has been shared -- there were instances of confidential grant applications being shared abroad that should not have been.  That may not seem like a big deal, but not all of them are public for a reason. This isn't happening in social sciences, it's happening in areas where they will have access to sensitive information and technology.\n3. It's well known there are rewards in the program for bringing sensitive and proprietary information to China -- how that happens isn't always someone copying a database onto a keydrive and flying home. They're expected to bring in students and other things towards the program and file on the research patents there, and often just as importantly bring students from the China program along and give them access.\n4. Examples of where access like this can go wrong are varied, [like Zaosog Zheng](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/us/chinese-scientist-cancer-research-investigation.html) the cancer researcher who stole vials of cells from a colleague's research at what appears to be the behest of the Chinese government -- where he'd publish it in China as his own in order to boost his own career. Or Yanqing Ye, who hid they were part of the PLA and continued to do assignments for the military while at Boston U.\n\nIt's true that at the end of the day, much of what happens and is developed will end up in academic papers, but both H and the NIH need to know the real risk someone presents when giving them access to other technology and other's research. In intelligence parlance they're called \"non-traditional collectors.\" So it's not illegal to take money from them, but it's illegal as all hell to lie about it. It isn't a paperwork mistake.",

                            "comment": "What I'm still not reading in your post is what the Chinese government was getting for almost a million dollars per year. It sounds to me like they were mostly getting a high-profile researcher to work with their students at a lab that they funded him to set up at their expense. Most of the assertions I find hard to believe just because they seem to rest on misunderstandings of how modern science is conducted. Let me address your points one by one:\n\n1. Ok, getting funding for the same thing from two different sources seems bad, especially if one of those sources is a foreign government. But in practice, these profs have relatively narrow ranges of expertise, so most of their funding is variations on some them/idea/technique. So it could be very easy to say that all of their funding is for the same thing depending on who is being asked. So, I would expect we'd need people with real expertise to weigh in on this to have a sense of whether something wrong was done. But, this doesn't answer my question about what the Chinese government is getting for their money, and its not clear to me Leiber even did this. The work in the lab in China could be legit different in a way only someone with real expertise could evaluate.\n\n2. Ok, so as a working scientist, Leiber is asked to evaluate all sorts of proposals and ideas from other scientists- to serve as a peer reviewer for grant applications and the like. These are not public because they dont represent fully worked out ideas or experiments- people have ideas and often some preliminary results, and are asking for money to do the 'real' experiment. If they were already worked out and understood, they would end up as published literature and wouldn't need the funding. However, many of these ideas are deemed by their peers to be unlikely to work, unlikely to yield good results or to make sense with the funding goals. I've only really been on the proposing side of this equation, but I can tell you, based on what I've seen and heard, there are very few things being proposed that aren't anticipated or aren't variations on existing thems, or aren't straight up the same idea used in one place transposed into another. Basically, the idea that some scientist hears some amazing idea because they have access to funding proposals is pretty.. far-fetched. Nonetheless, if Leiber did share confidential information with the Chinese government, that seems like a clear violation of his duties as a scientist/reviewer, and possibly a violation of the law. This does get at the question of what the Chinese government could be getting for their $750k per year, but its a whole lot less nefarious than you seem to be making it out. Modern science, unlike what you might think of it from reading standard-bad-science journalism (where every small advance has to be billed as the next cure for cancer, otherwise lay people wont read, know or care), is not being advanced by brilliant singular ideas that are being carefully packaged into grant applications that are then sitting there waiting to be nicked by the unscrupulous. Instead, its so much more incremental. A professor at a place like Harvard, who is plugged into what is going on, is probably not getting blind-sided by amazing ideas by reviewing grant applications.\n\n3. Ok, but again, is Leiber in possession of ideas that aren't already freely circulating in the professional circles/literature/whatever that he takes part in? Like, does this guy have literal state secrets that he is giving up to a foreign power? My guess is the answer is no, he's a professor at a research university who wants to publish as much as he can. He's not working on secret/top secret things. Even his DoD funding, I'm guessing from my own experience as a grad student, does not restrict his making public any of his results. He's a professor; part of his job in doing research is to engage with students and get them interested and motivated. I would expect if he's (legally) set up a lab, wherever it is, to do the type of things you've described. My PhD adviser took a sabbatical year in a foreign (not-China) country. There he worked with and mentored students, conducted research, and used and benefited from the resources of said country. His involvement on some level may have benefited said country and its students (much more so than the US). Is he guilty of the same impropriety as what Leiber is accused of?\n\n4. What does this have to do with Charles Leiber? As an aside, I've talked to a PhD Biologist who thinks this whole situation is trumped-up nonsense. I don't work with biological materials, but according to him, sharing cell-lines is common, and the reporting here is highly skewed to make it sound like something it's not.\n\nHonestly, I think many people have the wrong idea of how science works, and in cases like this, where a state actor that we distrust or dont like is involved, it's easy to see something that's not there. Maybe Leiber did something more like what you're suggesting and shared something truly secret or confidential in a way that goes beyond what a university professor would typically know about. In that case, he should be held accountable by the law. However, I seriously doubt it. I'm more concerned about the chilling effects this and other cases have on science and scientist's ability to transcend boundaries for the sake of advancing human knowledge.",

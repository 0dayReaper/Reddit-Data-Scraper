    "postText": "Hello everyone!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an Asian student with a burning passion for AI research, and I'm on the hunt for remote research opportunities at Harvard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot only do I have a strong academic profile, including a perfect 4.0 GPA and straight A\\*s, but I also bring over 700+ hours of practical experience in AI to the table. I've been actively involved in hands-on projects, honing my skills in machine learning, neural networks, and other AI applications.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough I can't physically be on campus, I'm fully equipped for remote collaboration. We can connect online and work together seamlessly! I could also travel to the US depending upon the opportunity :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're looking for someone with practical expertise to contribute to your AI research project, count me in! I'm eager to explore cutting-edge areas like machine learning, natural language processing, and more. If you want to see the details of my experience, just let me know\u2014I'm happy to share my resume and other relevant documents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo the faculty members, researchers, and students at Harvard, if you have any leads or recommendations for AI research opportunities, I'd greatly appreciate it. Feel free to send me a private message.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for considering me! I'm truly excited about the possibility of joining forces with the talented research community at Harvard and making a real impact in the field of AI!",

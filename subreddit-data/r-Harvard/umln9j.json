I'd consider it very likely more issues would come up if someone looked back through her prior work.\n\nAs to what she was thinking, cultural differences between here and many countries in how plagiarism/cheating is viewed may be a component, as has the shift to viewing students as customers to be appeased across academia (look back through the events of the 2012 scandal here). It's often now about how likely you are to be caught and what the consequences will (or won't) be, as opposed to why taking someone's work and presenting it as your own effort is so wrong.",

Interested students were invited to submit concepts for the speech so she sought out the opportunity and had the fraud lined up before she embarked on it.  \n\nThis movie is going to take a predictable turn. In a matter of weeks people will switch over to defending her, saying she is being targeted by online bullies and she is a victim of patriarchal backlash because she tried to take her rightful place in the world. Details remain to be worked out but will likely be her dad \"making her\" apply, giving her this speech to read \"even though she wanted to write her own\", and making her read it.  \n\nEventually she'll get gigs as a motivational speaker sought after for her ability to inspire people to overcome their obstacles, and will probably run for office. Cynical prediction but wait and see :)",

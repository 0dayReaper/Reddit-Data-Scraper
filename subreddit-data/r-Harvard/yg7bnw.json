Think about your other commitments, how efficient you are with your work, and look at the Q guide for your current classes and gauge your actual outside of class hours to that of the average hours listed. Then calculate potential spring classes based on that. Maybe make your fifth class a fun one with sub 5 hours of work outside of class?? Don\u2019t overwork yourself \u2014 it\u2019s not a a race. If the fifth class is going to cause you stress or cut into your sleep and/or social I say forgo it.",

I was working 15-20 hours per week and tried to take five classes (social sciences) and it wasn't feasible. If I didn't have outside work I could've done it however. Also depends on the difficulty of the classes.",

It\u2019s doable, just gotta devote a lot of time to class and make sure you balance your classes to be easier, like if you have a couple humanities courses that\u2019s perfect and should work out. Limit yourself to 2 hard classes and you\u2019ll probably be fine, but no matter what it\u2019s probably a time commitment",

Harvard encourages depth &gt; breadth (explicitly prevented double concentrations up until this yr, for example), so students will tend to load up on grad-level courses before taking more overall courses. E.g., I've known people at UPenn taking 7+ courses while similarly competent people at Harvard will take 4 grad-level courses.",

Daddy long legs (spindly creatures commonly mistaken for a spider) cannot harm humans or can the common wolf a spider. Just keep your window shut or at least the screen down (if you have one.) Both are occasional guests in even the cleanest of homes. I suggest reframing your opinion on spiders as they are primarily helpful as they prey on other insects that are harmful/annoying. /r/spiderbro",

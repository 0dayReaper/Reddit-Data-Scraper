    "postText": "I am taking math 21a, cs50, physics 15a, and a freshman seminar this semester and wondering if it would be a good idea to drop one of the pset courses. Ive been managing so far but scared that things will ramp up and I wont be able to keep up. I dont really go to parties to socialize and most of my socializing happens while eating or in pset groups but I also want to have time to develop meaningful friendships this semester. Any help is appreciated!",

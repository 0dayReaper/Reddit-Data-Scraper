They won\u2019t rescind your admission unless you commit a crime, have a major scandal that they can\u2019t justifiably ignore, or fail all of your classes, or something on that scale.\n\n2. AP credit does not count for course credit at Harvard. AP languages will, however, exempt you from the language requirement at Harvard. If you plan to take at least two semesters of a language anyway, AP language will be useless, credit-wise. AP Calc can help with math class placement, but the placement is more of a recommendation than anything else, so you can take whatever math courses you feel ready for, even without AP scores or high placement exam performance (which you have to take anyway, regardless of AP).",

Math placement is based on the placement exam, although a 5 on BC provides another data point, but not credit. And really, the placement results are a guide; the recommendations are not forced on you. \n\nThe AP foreign language exams can fulfill the graduation requirement with the appropriate score, but no credit is given. And again, the same can also be accomplished by the departmental placement exam.\n\nSome exams, e.g. econ, psych, allow waivers for the corresponding Harvard course.\n\nBut bottom line, Harvard won't care if you don't take the exams.",

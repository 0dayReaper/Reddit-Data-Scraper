It may then seem obvious who should be in the double. Some people care more than others, snore, sleep hard, sleep light, have varsity practice early am etc. \nSwitching always sounds like a good idea, but it\u2019s a hassle. It does work sometimes, but try to see if there is an organic arrangement first.",

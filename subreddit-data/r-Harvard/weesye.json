At a supermarket buy one or two 2.5 gallon jugs of water which will be just a few dollars, and they usually come w an open and close spout. I cut a small hole at the top near a corner and once it ran out, i just refilled it at a water fountain. I only had to refill it around once or twice a week max but it was a nice amount of water to have as a reservoir in your room! If you are careful with the container and just leave it atop your dresser or something, the jug will last you the full year.",

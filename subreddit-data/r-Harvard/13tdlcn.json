    "postText": "Title sums up my issue pretty well. I\u2019m an MIT engineering undergrad interested in potentially pursuing patent law after college. The issue is that I worry about committing to 2-4 more years of school for a field I have relatively little opportunity to expose myself to at MIT. I was hoping Harvard would have some good courses that serve as introductions to the nature of law-related work (ideally in the patent law space, but not strictly necessary) but I have no idea where to even start looking. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.",

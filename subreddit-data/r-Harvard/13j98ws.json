    "postText": "Prefrosh here. I'm facing a tough decision regarding which pre-orientation program to choose AND have general questions regarding the arts community at Harvard (how closed off it is, especially film, theatre, &amp; creative writing).\n\nFor pre-orientation, I'm between FAP and FOP. On one hand, FOP seems like an ideal choice for a pre-orientation program. It offers a chance to connect with nature, meet new people, and recharge before the academic rigor begins. It could be a great way for me to find my footing and would be helpful with the burnout I'm currently experiencing. On the other hand, the arts have always been a significant source of joy in my life, and I genuinely want to continue pursuing them during my time at Harvard. \n\nI've heard that the arts community can be somewhat closed off so I was thinking that FAP might be my only opportunity to start off there--especially as an international student. Plus, I ALWAYS meet the coolest people doing the arts, and I know I'll be pursuing my passion for all four years at Harvard. It's just that FOP seems like a more fitting pre-orientation program, whereas FAP aligns with my long-term aspirations.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any insights or advice from those who have experienced either program or have faced a similar dilemma. I would also appreciate any insight into the arts community at Harvard!\n\nTHANK YOU&lt;3",

And I even came from an outdoors/hiking background.\n\nI had a good low ratio of coFOPpers who got on my nerves (I mostly liked the whole bunch!) AND I had great weather.  I think if both of those factors were a disaster it could be different.\n\nI was a concentrator in an arts(ish) degree anyway so I knew that I might as well just do FOP.  I don't think you should discount the arts community, no matter what the crowd, you always find your people, and it's not like missing FAP would be some lost opportunity to make inroads.\n\nGo with your gut.",

Imo the theater scene is easy to join (they're always looking for staff/pit members, for example) and people are kind but it can be hard to join in socially if you have a peripheral role. Honestly I'd just go with whatever sounds more fun, as everyone said, it's probably pretty low stakes :) FAP did introduce me to a lot of people in arts but I don't think it would be your only opportunity by any means. DM me if you need more details!",

I went on it my freshman year then led trips sophomore through senior year. So much fun and so many good memories. If you get the chance to do a Switch trip (canoeing and hiking) do it!!!",

            "comment": "I would do FOP. Like you, I did SO much music/art in high school, so FOP was an excellent way for me to do something I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise done. It also is just so much fun and like you said, is a great chance to find peace and reflect before starting a new chapter of your life.\n\nI\u2019m quite involved with theater at Harvard (and I did FOP), so feel free to send a message my way :) but that being said, the theater community on campus is INCREDIBLE and just filled with wonderful, talented people. The Froshical (first year musical, an original show entirely written, produced, performed by freshmen) is an excellent way to sort of \u201cbreak in\u201d your first year, as it traditionally has a LOT of people doing theater for the first time and is a great experience in general. \n\nLike I said, feel free to send me a message anytime, but good luck!!",

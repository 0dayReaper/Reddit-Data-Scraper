    "postText": "Hello,\n\nIn my first semester at Harvard, I was pretty sure I wanted to pursue CS. I took CS50, fresh seminar, expos 20, and math 1b. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure now CS/software engineering isn\u2019t a fit for me, and I want to try something along the lines of finance &amp; business.\n\nDoes anyone recommend certain classes for a freshman\u2019s second semester interested in finance and business? Thanks!",

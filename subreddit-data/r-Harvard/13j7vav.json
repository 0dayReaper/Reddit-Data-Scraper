    "postText": "I've only recently just learned that a few courses at Harvard can be enrolled in simultaneously (for reference, I'm an incoming first-year so only just beginning to take a look at the nuts and bolts of how courses work). Do people typically enroll in a simultaneous course, or is it a pretty rare thing to do? Do you still get assigned a section, etc or is it closer to just auditing a course? What's it like?",

            "comment": "The College only allows simultaneous enrollment for a small number of courses that meet various criteria. There is a list at [https://oue.fas.harvard.edu/simultaneous-enrollment](https://oue.fas.harvard.edu/simultaneous-enrollment) that gets updated each semester. \n\nYou mentioned auditing. It's almost the *opposite* of auditing. An auditor typically attends in person but doesn't attend section or office hours, and doesn't submit assignments or take exams. For simultaneous enrollment, it would be typical to attend section and office hours in person, and of course necessary to do the assignments and exams.\n\nOften the course that allows simultaneous enrollment offers lecture videos as a substitute for attending lecture in person, to make it feasible to attend the conflicting class in person. Some students find it harder to focus with lecture videos than attending in person, while other students prefer the convenience of lecture videos (being able to watch it anywhere, any time, as well as being able to pause, rewind, and fast forward). \n\nThere are surprisingly few legal time slots in a day (with further complications due to Allston scheduling and the fact that Tuesdays 3 - 5 is reserved for FAS faculty meetings). So it is helpful to sometimes have this as an option. It is not always ideal, but it may be much better than only being able to take one of the two conflicting courses that you really want or need to take. You could also take one of the two courses in a different semester, but some courses are not offered every year, or you may need the material sooner, or there could be other conflicts next time the course is offered.",

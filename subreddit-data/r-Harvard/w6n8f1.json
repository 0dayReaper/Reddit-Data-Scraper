The idea is that young people who have erred, been disciplined at school, or even committed a crime may still be highly qualified, and deserve a chance to demonstrate they\u2019ve made amends, gone to therapy, continue to contribute positively to society, and are competitive applicants.\n\nNot the line of work I\u2019d choose, but it\u2019s likely that this student\u2019s application was very carefully tailored to either sidestep the issue or tell the story through a lens of accepting responsibility, growth, etc.",

More common in private schools too since parents hold more power and more flexibility. Not limited to sexual harassment - cheating, stealing, etc with parents threatening lawsuits usually end up in a student being withdrawn.\n\nI would question whether the student you know was actually expelled - likely they just withdrew and transferred to another school.",

There's an issue where someone violating a policy can mean a whole lot of things, and without context it's just a witchunt.

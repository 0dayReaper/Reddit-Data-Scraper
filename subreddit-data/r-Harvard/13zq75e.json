There are so many here, and it can certainly be overwhelming to decide which ones to commit to. I'd like to learn more about what the comp processes were like, unique events/opportunities, camaraderie, etc. Thanks!",

For instance, The Crimson has well-outlined requirements for joining on their \u201cAbout\u201d page. I might also ask this question in the Harvard Community Hub Discord if you haven\u2019t already. Hope you find what you need!",

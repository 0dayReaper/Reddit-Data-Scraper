At the main campus there's the FASRC cluster and I think everyone has to pay for that. \n\nI think most are set up for research labs, so if you're affiliated with one that would make it easier, but you could probably get some access as an undergrad by convincing the right people if you have a legitimate use of the resources.\n\nYou might also look into AWS because I heard they give lots of free credits for academic uses.",

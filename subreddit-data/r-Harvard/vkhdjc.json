This is a gem for sure - the grading is very light and the assignments are straightforward and not too much work. Prof McKeon is a classics phd but loves sports as well and teaches the class very well imo. Take this course absolutely if you have any interest in sports (or not!) and the intersection of ethics.\n\nI gave a medium amount of effort and got an A-",

He\u2019s teaching it again in the coming fall and spring semesters. He\u2019s a good teacher; brings good energy, very engaging and helpful, and very flexible. For example, we were allowed to format citations however we chose to, while some preceptors forced students to do Chicago only or MLA only, etc.\n\nHis grading was quite generous, so on a scale of 1 to 10, maybe a 3 or 4. Keep in mind that this is relative to other preceptors, who I\u2019ve heard can be very harsh in their grading.\n\nDefinitely would recommend the course.",

The second part you connect 1984 to the outside world and do a research essay and a capstone project.\n\nCole is a very chill professor and he is understanding with extensions and all, his grading is fair, generous even. His class isn't one where only a certain amount of people get As. I put it not too much effort into the class and ended up with an A. \n\nIn terms of difficulty, the class is a 2 or 3, the only hard part is the time crunch in the second unit when you have to do the essay and the capstone project near finals. \n\nI would definitely recommend the course, it's an interesting and engaging topic with a great professor and relatively light workload.",

I say this because many of you have no idea what ur concentrating and to get required classes out of your way is a blessing when you are more aware of what you like second semester.",

Assuming expos is required regardless of taking Hum10, I would take expos 10/10 times to get it over with. I heard that Hum10 is hard as it is, but if you are truly interested in it, go ahead and take it. I am not trying to shit on expos btw, many people have liked it. From a strategy standpoint, you should try to get ur prereqs over with ASAP because chances are you don't know what you are studying/interested in.",

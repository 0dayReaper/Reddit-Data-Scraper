    "postText": "(plot twist: I'm actually the husband)\n\nMy wife has the chance for a fellowship at Harvard Center for Astrophysics, which would involve us moving out there with our dog in tow. We're so early along the process that she hasn't even applied yet, nevermind been accepted etc etc. So this is a vague question based on a possibility rather than a certainty - but it's something we need to try and square away in our minds before making any decisions (or applications).\n\nSo yeah: she's early 30s, I'm late 30s, we're both well past our partying student days, we have a dog who needs a fair bit of space, and she wouldn't want to commute more than 30 or so minutes each way per day.\n\nWhat are our options?\n\nWe'll be in a decent financial position, but looking at rents around the Cambridge area it looks like we'd be expected to pay at least three times what we pay here (Worcester (UK, not MA)) for a one-bed. That sort of makes me feel physically sick, but hey whatcanyoudo.\n\nAny local knowledge-help would be appreciated. And apologies it's a bit vague - as I say, very early along the process. But it's a big (potential) decision, so I want to try and get as much info as we can.\n\nEDIT - thanks for the replies, genuinely appreciate the insight. She's, right now, probably going to put her application in for the fellowship so we might be there in a year or so!",

Harvard Housing is much more expensive than that, especially dog-friendly suits. If you check out farther locations, you can find a 1bd that will also be cheaper than Harvard Housing. When I was looking for apartments this spring, there were some decent places near Reservoir and in Brookline. Check them out, but plan early, and you'll be fine. Just look for somewhere you can take a (single!) bus to Harvard from.",

We have 2 cats and live in a decent-sized 2 bedroom near Brookline. There\u2019s a bus stop very close by that I take right into the Square. It\u2019s actually a very quiet neighborhood and the reservoir nearby has tons of folks out with their pups. Good luck!",

Just be aware that the neighborhoods around Boston college are full of students and they like loud parties. Otherwise, we like it here a lot. \n\nThe other area we liked a lot was Beverly, but we didn't end up there, so I can't give you more details. \n\nGood luck to you both no matter what you decide.",

            "comment": "Rents in the Boston area are insane.  I'm an alum -- so, not a Harvard affiliate anymore, and I don't have to go into the Harvard campus -- and I live in Arlington (but we bought the house; it's not a rental).  You might have luck finding something in Arlington where you can walk to the 77 bus, which goes down Mass Ave and your wife can get out near the CFA, which is out in that direction, instead of all the way in Harvard Square.  But rents will be ridiculous wherever you go.\n\nOne thing you might consider is looking at a bus map.  Harvard Square Station is a major bus hub -- it used to be the terminus of the Red Line about 40 years ago before they expanded it north, but it kept its bus routes -- and there are a bunch of places around the area with direct buses to Harvard.  There's Allston (no space for a dog, though), Watertown, and Waltham, for example.  But 30 minutes for a commute is pushing it.\n\nI haven't mentioned driving in.  THAT'S BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT FIND PARKING ANYWHERE NEAR HARVARD unless you have a Cambridge permit, which you will not have if you aren't a Cambridge resident.  You'd end up paying a ton of money in parking at a garage (there are a handful here and there).  Really, your options are bus or subway, unless you want to bike.  Which some people do.  But, like, it snows here.",

    "postText": "I'm a rising sophomore thinking about what CS class to take this fall. I'm leaning towards 120, but I would like to know what course would appear to be better to take. For context, I'm not particular interested in doing theoretical CS in career, but I could find the material interesting while taking the class. I've taking CS50, CS51, and CS20 so far. \n\nBased on the QGuide, I hear much more positive reviews (although from a smaller sample size) about CS120 and mostly negative reviews about 121? Although CS120 is supposed to be easier than 121, will I learn significantly more from 121? Is 120 more practical?",

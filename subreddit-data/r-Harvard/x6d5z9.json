They've helped me personally before.\n\nHarvard is a place that will mess with your mind. Imposter syndrome is everywhere; even many faculty face it. I really wish the faculty would talk about it more. A few years ago, a professor teaching a class I sat in on gave a talk about it and you could see visible relief from the students. It's something many Harvard affiliates experience.\n\nI'm unsure about bullying, but depression and anxiety are very common, too. People (at least at the grad schools that I'm familiar with) tend to put their coursework/program/research first and their social life second. The environment can become toxic to mental health quickly.\n\nIn terms of suicides, I've known two people who lost their lives here. The pressure-cooker-like environment here makes people do things they wouldn't normally consider, much less plan out.\n\nIf you're having a rough day, please consider texting 988. They're completely confidential.",

Cambridge has some extra weird vibes in the same way Notre Dame does where it's disconnected enough from the city that it can be very isolating if you haven't found a clique in your program and aren't willing to head into Boston. You're staring at a lot of banks and homogenized *flavorless* *adequate* *sameness* which can take a toll.",

            "comment": "Bullying - to the best of my knowledge and experience, of course - does not happen much. However, depression is, sadly, extremely common. Suicide also happens from time to time. Why? Well, to answer simply, studying is hard. The workload, the amount of stuff you have to do from day to day, is absolutely intense and extreme. Way too much, frankly. A lot of times, you'll find yourself working hard but still not getting the results you want. The environment, the social pressure, the so called imposter syndrome and every other aspect combined, creates an extremely stressful and toxic experience. It is so bad for your organism and mental health that, honestly, I'd even say that studying at Harvard - all things considered - is not worth it.",

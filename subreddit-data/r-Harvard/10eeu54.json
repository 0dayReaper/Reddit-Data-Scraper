    "postText": "Lease time is coming up - I hate this process. \n\nHas anyone ever used:\n\nHarvard University Housing (HUH) Rentals, Coldwell Banker Rental Services, or Private Market Rental Resources...?\n\nI've only ever done the zillow/Craigslist dance in the past. Having an agent assist would likely be nice, but not all agents are created equal. Is it worth the effort to go through Harvard, do the properties tend to be managed better/in better areas/be good deals?",

            "comment": "I just moved out of Harvard Housing. Terribly overpriced, but there are perks. Such as things get fixed super fast, no 1st/last/deposit (just the prorated amount of the month), rent isn\u2019t going to increase on you at the rate a privately owned one would, super fast/free internet (most properties), easy to transfer to another (so long as there is availability), and you can move out with just a few weeks notice in case you find something better. \n\nCons: as mentioned super expensive (I was paying $2700 for 450 sqft), no parking at most buildings (if you have a car it has to be registered in MA to get street parking and some buildings don\u2019t even qualify for parking), most units are not pet friendly, it\u2019s a free for all in the early summer they just release hundreds of available units and you got to pick one within minutes of the release or they\u2019ll all be taken by other Harvard affiliates.\n\nI lucked out and got a sweet condo in Brookline Village (I work in Longwood). $350 cheaper per month, twice the size, pet friendly (got a cat), parking spot including, heating included, 2 mins from the Brookline village T stop. It was a hell of time getting it though, Boston area housing market is rough! And I\u2019m from Los Angeles and went to college in the Bay Area. \n\nDM me if you have more questions.",

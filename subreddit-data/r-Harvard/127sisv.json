I am an exchange student who thinking about taking a summer course, so actually not much I can choose from (restricted to the 3-week [session I](https://courses.dce.harvard.edu/?srcdb=202303&amp;summer_school=summer_school_adult_and_college&amp;session=SU2) &amp; [session II](https://courses.dce.harvard.edu/?srcdb=202303&amp;summer_school=summer_school_adult_and_college&amp;session=SU2) offered by Adult, Extension, &amp; Visiting College and  I am only able to take on-campus and undergraduate course that are outside Science range (e.g. CSCI, MATH is not allowed).). How about the grading of this course? Is it easy to get an A?",

            "comment": "Most people don\u2019t realize this but transfer credits are entirely determined by the school accepting the credits and it varies considerably.\n\nIn general, a school will give credit if they have a class that covers similar material.  For that reason you\u2019re better off taking Intro to Spanish than Advanced Modern Polynesian Folklore.  That said, some schools might accept a class they don\u2019t offer and count that class as a free elective.  \n\nSome schools accept no transfer credit at all, some accept a limited number, and some allow you to virtually graduate entirely using transfer credits from other schools.\n\nWhether a school accepts a transfer course has nothing to do with the rigor of the school.  MIT might allow a course to transfer while Bunker Hill Community College might decline that same class.\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve never seen grades transfer with a course.  There\u2019s usually a minimum earned grade to transfer in a class (usually a C) but once it\u2019s transferred in, your transcript just shows the credit with no grade and treats it as a \u201cPass.\u201d \n\nSome schools post their transfer equivalents online (classes that have historically been allowed to transfer in), so you can search for that.  Beyond that, the best advice is to contact the school you might transfer into and ask them if a particular HSS class will transfer.  They may or may not be able to tell you (it requires a syllabus review and they may not want to spend time on that for a prospective student).",

    "postText": "1.) I'm an incoming freshman at Harvard. I\u2019m trying to decide whether to take Math 21a or 1B. I did relatively fine on Calc BC during my senior year in high school (4 on Ap exam). \n\n2.) I have never coded before (until just very very recently), but I am now planning on becoming a software engineer. Is cs50 too hard to balance with math 21a for someone who has never coded before? \n\n3.) How is CS at Harvard, and why does it not rank as high as some of the other ivies?",

            "comment": "1. What did you get recommend for based on your math placement exam results? To get recommended for Math 21-55, you need to either pass all 3 sections or pass the first 2 + get a 5 on the Calc BC exam.\n2. CS50 won't be too hard with no experience and it is a great class for beginners. You'll be fine, but if you are interested in concentrating in CS, take it for a letter grade.\n3. All STEM majors are pretty accessible at Harvard for those with no prior experience except probably Math. If you take CS50+CS51, you'll feel much more caught up by the end of the year (in terms of coding). I can't answer why CS ranks lower than some of the Ivies, but I don't think you need to worry about that. People say that CS here is very theoretical, which is kind of true, but you will best learn software engineering by doing practice outside of school through internships or personal projects. Sophomore year CS courses (CS121 + CS124) tend to be quite difficult, but that doesn't really have to do with coding experience (in fact, you don't really need much coding experience to take these classes). They tend to be difficult because you need a high level of mathematical maturity. However, overall, you will be fine concentrating in CS with no prior experience, and your prior experience won't really matter at all after freshman year.",

Your AP score and math rec doesn\u2019t indicate that but only you can tell whether those two tests are an accurate representation of your calc knowledge. Best thing is to take 21A and drop it if you think it\u2019s too hard.",

How comfortable did you feel? If you got most of the stuff on a single pass, with only a few thing that you are unfamiliar with, you should be fine. Otherwise, you may struggle (not a bad thing necessarily if you do not go nuts over grades). If you have struggled with the first few topics, but still want to take a 21, you have a month. Just go  over it on your own. A lot of people do that if a stem course has a math prerequisite they have not fulfilled and a lit of the time they are fine. Re cs50, it is not a hard class and there are tons of resources for students, but it is a ton of work, especially with near zero coding experience.",

If you want to take a class in software engineering, you should be able to take it. I am not saying we should kill our theory requirements, just give more options to students",

Not software engineering. \n\nLike there\u2019s no denying Harvard CS could improve a lot. I don\u2019t know what you are arguing here. Why wouldn\u2019t it be good for students to have options?",

    "postText": "Hello, all,\n\nI'm starting a doctoral program next month and I'm currently trying to plan out my classes. Is there a way to see where courses have been held in the past, or, ideally, where they'll be held in the coming semester? The search on-line just lists TBA everywhere. I tentatively have two back-to-back courses with fifteen-minute breaks between them, and, as much as I want to take all four, I'm a bit hesitant to sprint across a still-unfamiliar campus twice a week.\n\nI'd appreciate any insights or suggestions. Thanks in advance!",

But **in general**, most courses for a given department are in the same building.\n\nRegardless, 15 minutes is ample time to get between classes from most buildings",

If you happen to have classes between the SEC (very South) and Pierce (very North) like I did, I recommend getting a scooter or a bike or a bluebike membership (you get a school discount), or take the shuttle if the weather is bad, and you should be fine. SEAS classes can have this arrangement since SEAS splits its department all over the campus. But like others said, for other departments, the classes should be close to each other.",

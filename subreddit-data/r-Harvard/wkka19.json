    "postText": "Hi!\n\nFor current/past students of Harvard, would you say that it is easy to tailor your class selection to find classes taught exclusively by professors. I'm a little concerned about getting a really bummy grad student instead of a professor (evidently not all grad students are bummy), so would you say there is a way to maximize my opportunity to enroll in such classes, and is it easy? This is barring any major lectures with celebrity-esque profs. Thanks so much in advance.",

            "comment": "There seems to be a misconception behind your post that because someone is a professor, they are a good teacher. This is not true, and many faculty are not particularly interested in teaching undergrads (they're generally hired in the first place because they're great researchers). Of course, there are the gems who are both world-class researchers and teachers; and you should take as many classes as you can with them.",

    "postText": "Ok I'm just pissed and want to share my anger. \nHarvard recreation reduced hours and now I can't go to the gym at all!\n\nMAC is the only gym open in the afternoon and the only gym that has showers, but it is CROWDED all the time (I've tried 10am, 12pm, 2-3pm, 5-8pm is just hell).  They put a picture on the door with \"MAC usage rates\" last week, so I assume that I'm not the only one unhappy with the situation. This picture is just not true, this data is from last AY and not from this summer! Also there are just fans and no central AC in the basement where the machines are.\n\nHemenway is open till 2pm. So if I go there, the only option is before work. But Hemenway has no showers.\nMurr center is lovely and never crowded, open till 3pm, but has no showers either. Same problem. \nI even went to Quad, but the showers there STINK and the locker rooms are disgusting, I didn't dare to use them. \n\nAnd here am I, a grad student who works on campus every day and desperately needs the gym for my back pain caused by my sedentary work. How am I supposed to fit workouts into my schedule? Quad is out, MAC is out. When I go to MAC, 3 times out of 5 I just see the crowds and leave right away. I could go to Hemenway/Murr in the morning but I live off campus, am I supposed to go to MAC to get a shower before work? \n\nAnyone else suffering from that?",

Therefore, I go to MAC, which doesn\u2019t have AC\u2026 Wtf? \n\nI was in the weight room at 6:30 pm earlier this week. It was literally hotter than outside, while we were in a heatwave. I felt like I could overheat, and I was underperforming because of it. However, when I went yesterday, the AC was on and it felt fine\u2026 Why is it only sometimes on?",

They actually also used to have 2 Olympic platforms at Murr but then they got rid of them.\n\nIt's kind of a joke how much more organized this stuff is at BU. I had a winter membership at the BU gym through my partner during the winter/spring to use the indoor track, and unlike Harvard BU posts their indoor track hours, and they have Olympic platforms at their gym, and it was open until like 11 during the academic year and 10pm during the summer session in june (although not as many squat racks as Murr now)",

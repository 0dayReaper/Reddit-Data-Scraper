    "postText": "I'm interviewing for a doctoral program at HGSE next week (very excited about this, it's the first I've heard back from for this cycle!) and am curious if folks who are at HGSE themselves, or have second-hand experiences, could share some insight into what the grad school is like. Do students actually hang out with each other? Is it the kind of environment that everyone is secretly competing with each other but pretends they're not on the outside? I'm trying to get a sense of what to expect if/when the \"culture shock\" hits, so to speak, if all goes well next week.\n\nWould love to hear anything and everything y'all are willing to share about the HGSE world!",

            "comment": "I have mostly positive things to say about the community. I haven\u2019t experienced any toxic competitiveness firsthand. From what I\u2019ve seen, most people at HGSE are more than willing to go out of their way to our support fellow classmates. If you\u2019re here, it\u2019s probably because you care deeply about the kids at the end of the day, and I would say that most people recognize that it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interest to support each other to become the best educators/policymakers/etc. we all can be. However, every place on the planet has jerks and Harvard is no exception. Overall though, it\u2019s firmly a net positive in my view.",

This is definitely the sense I've been getting so far, from conversations I've had with current students in the program I'm eyeing. Definitely appreciate the reminder that there will be jerky, privileged people everywhere you go, including Harvard.",

No, the vibe wasn\u2019t overtly competitive, and I don\u2019t think it was secretly competitive either.\n\nThere were tons of resources and opportunities, and students had a wide range of interests. There were times when peers were selected for opportunities over me (because they were a talented group!), but it probably went both ways. I felt super-fortunate to be there, inspired by my peers, supported by my peers, supportive of my peers, and motivated to make the most of the opportunity.",

I\u2019m anxiously awaiting a decision after having interviewed for the PhD program yesterday, and am more invested than I ever expected to be - Harvard\u2019s program was one I applied to \u201cjust because\u201d and I didn\u2019t have high hopes for having a fighting chance. Now that I\u2019ve somehow made it as a finalist and it\u2019s an actual possibility, I\u2019m dying to go there and am freaking out! But, it\u2019s great to know that if this works out, I\u2019ll be around good-hearted folks \ud83d\ude0a",

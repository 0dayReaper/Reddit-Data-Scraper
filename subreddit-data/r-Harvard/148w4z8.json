If your supervisor/boss is an HMS faculty member, you can ask them to fill out the [Countway Library Proxy Form](https://countway.harvard.edu/about/research-assistants) on behalf of you. \n\nThey\u2019ll get in touch with you and set you up with a Harvard ID as well as a library card that grants you access to Countway and it\u2019s online services. Hope this helps!",

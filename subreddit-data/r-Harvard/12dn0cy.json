Loans could hinder buying a home and all sorts of other things later in life.",

I'd say they target political science nerds, and people from developing countries.\n\nThe former are expected to pay from their own pockets; the latter tend to get scholarships from their own countries' governments.  \n\nWhen I attended we had many Japanese students who got full scholarships from the Japanese governments. I guess the government had already agreed to hire them as diplomats upon graduation.\n\nAt the end of the day, the core objective of the HKS is to spread democracy, democratic values, and increase the number of democratically-governed countries around the world.\n\nIf you're not learning about democracy and democratic governance/change/transition; and you're not into political science, then you're unlikely to benefit from attending this school.",

There were some for foreign students, but virtually non for Americans. The best offer I got was a student loan at virtually 0 percent interest rate. I ended up paying out of my own pocket and using the tuition cost as a tax exemption",

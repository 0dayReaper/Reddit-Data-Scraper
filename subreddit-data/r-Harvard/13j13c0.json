    "postText": "Hi there! I\u2019m attending as a visiting student next year. Currently, I hope to use the opportunity to develop technical skills. \n\nAs per the title, I would appreciate any recommendations. Ideally, I would cram as much of a CS degree into one year as possible. But I also understand that they schedule classes across semesters under the assumption most people will take them over four years.\n\nI come from a humanities background, so I have limited experience. However, if it counts for anything, I hope to finish CS50X (the Python one) online before I get on campus.\n\nMy programme has no module requirements, and I can cross-register at MIT.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I took these courses in the span of four semesters that significantly improved my data science and computation skills:\n\n\nFall 2021: Stat 110\n\nSpring 2022: Math 21B, Stat 111, CS 32\n\nFall 2022: Psych 1950, Stat 185, CS 182\n\nSpring 2023: Applied Math 105, 115, 120\n\nI would say Stat 111, CS 32, Stat 185, CS 182, and Applied Math 120 were most integral to my growth. These can definitely be taken in one academic year, but note that Stat 110 and Math 21B or their equivalents are pre-requisites for these courses. These also aren\u2019t the only classes you could take. Others include CS 181, CS 109A/Stat 121A, lots of class from the Stat department in general.",

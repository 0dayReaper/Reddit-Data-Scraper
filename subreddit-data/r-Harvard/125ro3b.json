            "comment": "If you're more interested in the field of academia or think tanks, I'd recommend GSAS. If you're more into policy (politics, public service), then HKS would be a better fit. HKS is geared towards working professionals or individuals with some experience who want to advance in their fields whilst GSAS skews younger. Anecdotal, but the networking opportunities at HKS tend to be farther-reaching/more international in scope. I've also observed HKS to have more UN/international folks in comparison to GSAS, so it your interests are more national vs international, that's something to look into. \n\nYou'll have an amazing experience either way. Have fun, and if it's still there, check out Gato Rojo in the basement of Lehman. Hidden gem, fairly quiet :)",

    "postText": "Hey y'all. Wish I was not in this situation but I am. International student on little financial aid. I thought I could afford a graduate degree but a terrible tragedy happened and between funeral costs, flights back home etc I lost up a bunch of my savings. Don't have a job lined up this semester... although I guess I will get one later, but for now I can either afford rent or food. School has declined any possible aid, I need to know any stable sources of food. Sometimes I crash events for food but they're like once in a week. Know any food pantries which will give food to international students? I visited the community centre in Cambridge and could only see a farmer's market. Also paranoid considering my F1 visa status, do food pantries even serve people like me? Will appreciate any help. Please be kind, I don't know how I ended up here either.",

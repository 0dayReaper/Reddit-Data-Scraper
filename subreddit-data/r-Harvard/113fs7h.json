Great way to find people with mutual interests or ambitions. For me, it\u2019s political figures at HKS or HLS.\n\n- Athletic events. Harvard may have less enthusiasm for its sports teams compared to the typical large American college, but there is still plenty of school spirit to bond over. Sometimes I make friends out of high-five celebrations right after our team scores a goal, sometimes it\u2019s while waiting in line to win prizes or buy concessions in other parts of the stadium. In my experience of (unintentionally) finding friends at sports games, hockey and basketball are ripe scenarios but football not so much (outside of the Harvard-Yale game). Even beyond meeting students from any and all parts of campus, athletic events are great ways to connect with alumni as well.\n\nI hope this helps:)\n\nSource: current grad student at Harvard",

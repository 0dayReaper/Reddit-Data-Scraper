    "postText": "Thinking of taking CS50 as a humanities major. I have experience with HTML and CSS, and basic JavaScript and Python - a few weeks of classes of each. I haven't taken any computer science courses before. I really need to keep my GPA up, but I do have a slightly heavy courseload in the fall, so I'd be worried about how much time the course would take up.",

            "comment": "CS32 is another option for beginner-level CS. The difference is that it focuses on just python. A lot of people recommend this one. I took it last semester, and even though I am garbage at coding, I got an A-. The psets are straightforward and aren't even graded for accuracy until halfway through the semester. No final exam, just a final project that's very easy to get a 100% on. Also each pset has like a week of grace period to turn in. I still feel like I learned a lot and can now do the simple leetcode problems without help.",

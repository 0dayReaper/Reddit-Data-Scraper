I was recently admitted to the Class of 2027 and was wondering if anyone had thoughts on what is something they wish they did before going to Harvard as a way to prepare or just for fun. *Is there a specific skill you wish you honed? Book(s) you read? An experience you had?* Literally anything. Thanks so much :)",

And then traveled around central america.\n\nI'm very glad I did. Working, living on my own, and experiencing the world meant I was in a much better place to get more out of Harvard. It was also just a lot of fun to not be tied down and go and experience the world.\n\nI think the more you can figure out what you want out of your undergrad experience and what you plan to do after, the better.",

Not saying don't--rather, just saying to be thoughtful about what your goals are and basic next steps towards them.\n\nLastly, to the above--\n\nFreshman year will go really fast.  If you know what you might want to do on day #1, you can hit the ground running.  E.g., if you want to work in software, familiarize yourself with the internship interview process--it has a very specific cadence that is very learnable.  \n\nTo be super clear, I don't say any of the above to stress you out!  Rather, being thoughtful now can make it *less* stressful in the future.  \n\nAbove all said--\n\nIf you change your mind 10 times in undergrad, that's incredibly normal, and you shouldn't take any of my above advice as concerns about \"falling behind\", or anything like that--you'll get to where you need to go in life.  Just providing advice that will help make it a calmer journey.",

I learned way more taking it in person because of sections and office hours and such, so I\u2019d highly recommend taking it.

When you do it online, you don\u2019t have to do it super thoroughly\u2026just helps to have seen the psets before so you don\u2019t procrastinate starting",

    "postText": "I think Harvard bills student twice (one before school start before Fall and another one before Spring semester start). cost/expense should be similar for each bill, but how about the financial aid part? Do they give out financial aid per school year or per semester? I got some  one time external scholarship before Fall starts, but not for Spring, does it mean I have to pay more for the Spring when they need to recalculate the aid??",

            "comment": "I took it last semester and previously had next to no coding/stats experience. Coding wise, it's definitely very approachable for beginners and I can say that I do now feel pretty comfortable with base R. However, the course tried to cram tons of stats into the last 1/3 of the class, which was a lot less intuitive for most and caused some students to feel like they'd hit a brick wall. At one point, they even had to give a pset extension to the entire class because of the abrupt change in pace. This part of the course definitely felt rushed and I honestly wish they'd spent less time on intro coding and more on teaching stats, as they seemed to think the former would confuse us more when it was actually the latter. Overall, don't regret taking the course though and do feel like I learned a lot. I think the professor and course model may be different in the fall though.",

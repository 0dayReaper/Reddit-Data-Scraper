These seem like great places to write/do work but so many of the libraries are in dorms and it feels weird to be there when I'm not an undergrad. \n\nI can't seem to find any agreed upon list of - \"Yeah technically you are ALLOWED to be there but like, only students go there man. Stay out.\" (except for Annenberg Hall which sucks because that room looks BEAUTIFUL and I'd love to see it) \n\nFellow staffers, students, what are some cool places I can go to \n where I won't feel like I'm encroaching on student space?",

            "comment": "Yeah, like someone else said, Barker cafe; also the cafe/Clover in the science center; Ticknor lounge in Boylston Hall. As a grad student I honestly don\u2019t even really think about the libraries in the dorms - Lamont and Widener are solid study spaces. Law library is good too,  as is Gutman (ed school library) and Tozzer (over on Divinity ave). Also there\u2019s a lot of open space in both the Smith center but also\u2014maybe better\u2014the law school student center. I\u2019m not a law school student, so similarly was concerned about feeling like an interloper, but it was all good!",

            "comment": "Senior Fellow here. Since I teach undergrad classes and have undergraduate researchers under me I tend to work a lot at Widener, Smith Center and the science center (which is mainly students). I see older profs there too so I think these spaces are fine. I did my PhD at Yale and the profs on my committee and my advisor would regularly be in the undergraduate common spaces, dinning halls, and libraries. I think Yale really leans into the whole liberal arts college pedagogy philosophy. \n\nOr you can always do what Mr. Burns did and dress up like Jimbo Jones so as to fit in.\n\nEdit- I do my office hours for research and classes at these locations since my lab is in Longwood.",

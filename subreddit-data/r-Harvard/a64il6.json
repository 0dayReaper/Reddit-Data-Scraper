    "postText": "Congratulations, you were admitted to Harvard. You're one of us, but with great power comes great responsibility. I'm not talking academic responsibility, but properly respecting the Harvard name. We're a special breed. People are out to get us, and it's the job of all of us to maintain the prestige behind the name.\n\nYou've probably already ordered your Harvard, Champion brand hoodie from the Coop. You made a good choice, it's the best hoodie. But the next time you're at Chipotle and wearing it alongside your friends going to Brown, Cornell, or worse, *Yale,* do you know how to properly address the fact that yes, you do in fact go to Harvard?\n\nHere's a little guide of the time tested responses to the typical situations Harvard students may find themselves in having to discreetly explain that you're better than whomever you may be speaking to.\n\n**Ordering at Starbucks:** If you're getting a hot drink, make sure you ask for one of the red holiday cups. If they ask why, just a simple \"I'm a Harvard student\" will do the trick. They may give you a funny look, but it's jealousy, don't worry about it. Persist until you get your red cup, you wouldn't want to be seen with a green cup and have people think you go to Dartmouth.\n\n**Talking to a parent's friend:** Your parents are going to brag about you. Get used to it, it's the rest of your life. You need to lean to embrace it. Play the offence. Ask them where their children are going to college, such that you have the upper hand in saying \"I'm attending Harvard in the fall.\" You don't want to be cornered. You'll receive an array of responses. \"That's very impressive, your parents must be so proud!\" Tell the truth, don't beat around the bush. \"It is, and they are\" is the only proper response. Veritas means truth, after all.\n\n**On a date:** This one is tricky. Being self confident is important. It's good to let them know in the first few minutes, primarily to quickly figure out if they're a Yalie. The easiest option is to buy Harvard socks, and as soon as you meet, go down to tie your shoe. Your pant leg will rise, and their eyes will be drawn to your socks. It's discrete, but a good power move.\n\n**Being asked about college but you're unsure how to mention you go to Harvard:** This one takes work. People can sense the Harvard on you, but they'll often ask for confirmation. The easiest option is to say \"I'm a student at the college.\" Don't mention Harvard at first. This is to establish that once they ask \"which college?\" it's implied that they should have assumed Harvard. If they ask what you're studying, philosophy is the best answer. They're expecting finance, but philosophy will help further establish your intellectual dominance over them. Also, remember, it's **concentration**, not major.\n\n**Talking to your friends:** Your friends already know you're superior to them, but a bit of consoling for their admittance to Bowdoin or Wesleyan won't kill you. \"That program there is great\" is a good response to their concerns. Don't mention the discrepancy in endowment size, unless reassuring them that no college really needs more than 2bn anyway (make sure your fingers are crossed behind your back, just to be safe). If you're missing them, make sure you go visit them. You don't want them seeing how much better you have it, and besides, it gives you more opportunities to tell their friends where you go to school.\n\nI'm sure you've all updated your Facebook/Instagram/Tinders already, but make sure to do so now if you're yet to. You're going to have a great two years here before you start your business and drop out, make sure to make the most of them. Remember, don't be downwind of John when you and your friends go to pee on him, and, most importantly, YUCK FALE!",

When speaking to any person that you aren't certain is aware that you are a Harvard student, make sure that you mention it within 7 minutes of meeting them. \nSometimes this can be tough because people want to talk about things that aren't relevant to your announcement. Getting a Harvard phone case and setting a 7 minute timer is key, if it hasn't come up within the first 6 mins, go ahead and pull up your phone so they can see it and Google whatever subject they are talking about and Harvard, there will usually be something that pops up and work that into the conversation quickly.",

I just copy-pasted the email from Kirkland house admin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Where can I pick up my parcels when I arrive at my House?**\n\nFor most of the year, your House\u2019s building manager\u2019s office will receive your parcels and make them available to you at your House.\u00a0 Due to high parcel volumes at the beginning of the year, however, Harvard University Mail &amp; Distribution Services (HUMS) is opening temporary parcel receiving and distribution facilities called package depots.\u00a0 This is where you\u2019ll be picking up your parcels at the beginning of the semester.\n\n**When can I start sending parcels to my House mailing address?**\n\nThe depots can start receiving parcels on Wednesday, August 17th.\u00a0 Prior to that date, the depots will not be open to receive them.\n\n**What dates are the package depots open, and what are their hours?**\n\nThe package depots will be open between Wednesday, August 17th, and Tuesday, September 13th.\u00a0 They will be open Monday-Saturday, 8am-4pm.\u00a0 The depots will also be open on the Sunday of move-in weekend, August 28th.\u00a0 The depots will be closed on Monday, September 5th, for Labor Day.\n\n**Where are the package depots located?**\n\nThere will be three package depots this year.\u00a0 Please note that some of these locations have changed from previous years:\n\nMather, Dunster, and Leverett residents will pick up parcels from the Mather JCR.\n\nCurrier, Cabot, and Pforzheimer residents will pick up parcels from the Gilbert Living Room in Currier House.\n\nAdams, Eliot, **Kirkland**, Lowell, Quincy, and Winthrop residents **will pick up parcels from rooms 101 and 103 at 1201 Mass Ave.\u00a0 Those are the two rooms adjacent to the dining hall.**\n\n**How do I know when the depots have a parcel for me to pick up?**\n\nWhenever a depot receives a parcel for you, an automated email will be sent to you with instructions on when and where you can pick it up.\u00a0 Those emails will be sent from \u201c[notification@witstracking.com](mailto:notification@witstracking.com)\u201d.\u00a0 Please do not respond to parcel notification emails.\u00a0 You can contact [hums@harvard.edu](mailto:hums@harvard.edu) with any questions.\n\n**I have to move some heavy/large parcels from the depot to my House.\u00a0 Can I borrow a cart from the depot?**\n\nUnfortunately, none of the depots will have carts available for use.\u00a0 Your House building manager\u2019s office, however, will typically have carts or dollies you can borrow to move your parcels.\n\n**I\u2019ve tracked my parcel, and the tracking information says my parcel has arrived.\u00a0 Can I go pick it up from my package depot?**\n\nNo.\u00a0 Please wait for an email from the package depot alerting you that your parcel is ready for pick-up.\u00a0 If you come to pick it up before receiving that email, it will not be available for you.\u00a0 If over one business day has passed since your parcel\u2019s tracking information shows it as being delivered, but you still haven\u2019t received an email notification from the package depot, please contact [hums@harvard.edu](mailto:hums@harvard.edu), and let them know the tracking number of the parcel you\u2019re concerned about.\n\n**I\u2019ve received an email from an online store that my parcel has arrived.\u00a0 Can I go pick it up from my package depot?**\n\nNo.\u00a0 Please wait for an email from the package depot alerting you that your parcel is ready for pick-up.\u00a0 If you come to pick it up before receiving that email, it will not be available for you.\u00a0 If over one business day has passed since you received an email from an online store telling you your parcel has been delivered, but you still haven\u2019t received an email notification from the package depot, please contact [hums@harvard.edu](mailto:hums@harvard.edu), and let them know the tracking number of the parcel you\u2019re concerned about.\n\n**What about letter mail.\u00a0 Where can I pick that up?**\n\nLetter mail will be available to you at your mailbox in your House.\u00a0 If you haven\u2019t received your mailing address and your mailbox combination yet, you should receive them within a few days.",

            "comment": "From today's story on [Globe.com](https://Globe.com):\n\nKatey Stone\u2019s 26th season as the Harvard women\u2019s ice hockey coach, brimming with promise most of the way, suddenly was sinking \u2014 and Stone\u2019s anger was rising.Her 2021-22 team, champions of the Ivy League and ECAC regular seasons, had entered the regional ECAC playoffs as the top seed, only to be upended in the first round by a mediocre Princeton rival.\n\nAs the Crimson skated through a subpar practice before the ultimate challenge, the NCAA tournament, Stone\u2019s whistle shrieked. She abruptly curtailed the practice, profanely ordered everyone to the locker room, then stood before her players, two of whom proudly identified as North Americans of Indigenous descent.\n\nIn an outburst that witnesses described as degrading and dispiriting, Stone accused the players she had recruited of showing her too little respect and devolving into a collection of skaters \u201cwith too many chiefs and not enough Indians.\u201d\n\nMaryna Macdonald, a junior starting defenseman from the Ditidaht First Nation of Canada\u2019s Vancouver Island, said Stone looked her in the eye when she made the remark.\n\n\u201cI had learned to navigate a lot of her toxic environment,\u201d Macdonald said. \u201cBut now she was disrespecting me and my family and my heritage in front of everybody.\u201d",

            "comment": "I was originally going to give the coach the benefit of the doubt, as the offensive phrase was common parlance a decade ago, but starting a chant of \"I hate Mac\" against a player is way over the line. In Div 1 women's sports, psychological abuse is how many coaches try to get the max from their players.  For some reason, I didn't expect it at Harvard. Good for the players who put their self-respect first and moved on. Sounds like it's time for Harvard to move on from this coach. Note that the fact that there is a diversity of experiences on the team doesn't mean that the worst experiences didn't happen. The usual way the abuse plays out is for the coach to pick favourites, pick targets, and terrify the rest of the team that any slip-up will move them into the target category.",

                    "comment": "&gt;but starting a chant of \"I hate Mac\" against a player is way over the line.\n\nI agree on that. I'm trying to keep an open mind, as the article is well-written but also leaves out context needed. eg, they don't follow up with other players about that happening, which should have been easy to do considering how egregious it would have been if you visualize it? And when they do follow up with players, they mention the coach being supportive as people struggle with personal issues like coming out or other things and many coming together to sign a lettet of support.\n\nThe lack context really harms what's said -- they mention how some players have left the program but theres no comparison with the rate at which others left comparable programs elsewhere either for academic, personal or other issues.\n\nA large section of the article is about hazing of 1st years that sounds like she is involved, but then says theyre only talking about it because some think she has more of a duty to end the practices and is responsible for everything that occurs on the team.\n\nThe \"chiefs\" complaint is also a struggle as  the term is still commonly used today even if it's fallen out of favor as a metaphor and someone would say \"too many chefs instead of cooks\" or something. It's something that someone should be taken aside for and only more of an issue if it's intentionally happening.\n\nThe more you read the more complex it gets, like those complaining of body shaming because they were told they were too skinny or too big depending on their role. Considering the level they are playing at, I don't know how a coach can't tell players that within reason. The example where a player was injured during a game and the coach went with them to the hospital and followed up, and one day they were late due to treatments for their concussion and were berated -- the coach said they'd basically forgotten at the moment they'd been hurt. Which is honestly believable as each player has things going on, the coach has their head filled that practice and out it goes.\n\nThe real issue seems to be the berating for being late, or berating as a whole, and how expectations are changing from team members. Are other successful coaches at that level nicer about team members showing up late? We can kind of have an idea as to what will happen if it's entirely ignored and resentment and anger builds, but there's likely a middle way that doesn't involve all feedback being compliment sandwiches.",

Regarding ripping the player and claiming she forgot she had a concussion, unless the coach has had a brain injury herself, it seems hard to imagine she forgot that her player was knocked out on the ice and that she accompanied her to the hospital in an ambulance. Regarding the hazing, even if coaches are not involved, they are responsible for forbidding it, and ensuring that team leadership knows it's forbidden. Thus it does fall on the coach, and many coaches have been suspended when hazing occurred even though the coach was not present and had nothing personally to do with it.",

I can understand the coach has a life, christmas break, team responsbilities/admin with the university, all the interpersonal drama of team members and requests and scheduling, and that day it's believable to me they forgot the person hadn't been fully cleared for practice.\n\nThe real issue there to me is whether a team member should be berated and told they are selfish if they're missing practices or late.",

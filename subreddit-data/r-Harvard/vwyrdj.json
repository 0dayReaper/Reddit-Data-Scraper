            "comment": "Glad you're interested in Statistics! Typically about 10 students per year do the concurrent masters in Stat. The most common choices for the bachelors part of the degree are (in no particular order) math, applied math, CS, and statistics itself. Make sure to read up on the double-counting rules carefully, as doing a concurrent masters is much more feasible if you can double-count some courses. \n\n\\&gt; Is stat 110, stat 111, stat 210 sufficient by end of junior fall sufficient for entry? Thanks.\n\nYes, depending of course on your grades, this combination can satisfy the requirement at [https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/am-statistics](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/am-statistics)  \nthat \"Prior to applying, at least three statistics courses need to have been completed by the end of the semester in which the application is submitted, including at least one 200-level statistics course.  The grades must be at least B in each course.  Among these courses must be Stat 110 (or 210) and Stat 111 (or 211), with grades of at least A\u2212 in both.\"\n\nIt's fine that junior fall grades are not available until after the application is due (application is due December 1, which is before finals); decisions aren't made until the fall grades are in. \n\nNote that I teach all 3 of the courses you mentioned. So a possible downside is the risk of getting sick of me. But hopefully you'll enjoy the courses and learn a lot!",

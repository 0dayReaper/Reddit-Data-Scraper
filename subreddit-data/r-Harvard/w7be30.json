    "postText": "Incoming freshman here. I took the Spanish placement test and it recommended \u201cAll Spanish 60s courses.\u201d \n\nI got a 5 on the AP Spanish exam my junior year and was initially planning on taking Spanish 40. I\u2019m honestly very intimidated by the idea of Spanish 60 and am not sure what would be best. My speaking, writing, and grammar are decent but I sometimes struggle with reading actual books/plays/stories due to vocabulary.\n\nDo lots of non-native freshmen take Spanish 60? Or should I opt for Spanish 40 or 50 instead?",

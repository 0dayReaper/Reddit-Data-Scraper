    "postText": "Hi! I'm an incoming freshman and was wondering how competitive course registration is? Here are the current classes I want to take: \n\nLife Sciences 1a, Math 1a, History of Science 100, and Expos 20: Narrative, Media, and #MeToo. \n\nI was wondering if any of these courses are deemed competitive when choosing your courses? I know that the Expos 20 I want to do is limited to 15 students, but that's as far as I know when it comes to class limits.",

I personally don't feel that it makes much of a difference about **which** section of Expos you get, unless the topic is really uninteresting to you.",

            "comment": "By competitive, I assume you're referring to competition for spots. My understanding is that LS1a and Math 1a are service courses, so I wouldn't expect an issue. I'm not familiar with HoS 100, so I have no comment. I am personally unaware of people not receiving their first pick for expos, though I expect it happens. At the end of the day, an expos course is really about teaching you how to write effective essays, the specific content was, in my experience, really just subject material for said essays. For what it's worth, in my opinion, expos is heavily biased towards writing in HASS and not so useful for STEM writing (e.g. writing a math or physics paper is very different than writing a cultural studies paper).",

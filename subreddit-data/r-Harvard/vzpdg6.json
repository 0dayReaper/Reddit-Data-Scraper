    "postText": "Is it a bad idea to take 2 classes back-to-back? Or is 15 minutes plenty of time to get to the next class?\n\nAnd along the same lines, when I\u2019m picking classes, should I prioritize having a nice schedule? I\u2019m deciding between 3 Gen Eds that I frankly have no strong opinions about (my preferences for one over the others are very marginal), but there is one that\u2019s a clear winner in terms of schedule. Should I just take that one for the sake of my schedule?",

Like one class was 1:00 to 2:30 and the next was 2:30 to 4:00, which seems like 0 minutes in between but Harvard had an unofficial \"7 minute rule\" that said each class starts 7 minutes after the officially listed time.\n\nA couple semesters I *taught* back-to-back classes in different buildings, and literally ran from the end of giving one lecture to give the next lecture 7 minutes later.\n\nThe schedule changed completely in 2018: [https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/9/2/new-schedule-explainer/](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/9/2/new-schedule-explainer/)",

While stacking can be efficient, it might come at the expense of certain opportunities. What if you really enjoy the first of two back-to-back classes? How would you feel if you never had time to stick around after class and chat with your favorite professor?",

For the GenEd, having the content be at least mildly interesting and chill assignments will make a world of difference so do factor that in, but also don\u2019t wreck your schedule for a GenEd, if that helps.",

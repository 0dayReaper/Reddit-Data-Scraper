    "postText": "Hi there, I am a rising sophomore interested in participating in research in the Fall when I get back to Harvard, but I don't exactly know how to find good opportunities, besides just cold emailing professors. I am interested in computer science and electrical engineering, so I would definitely want a very technology-focused internship. Is it at all possible to participate in research at MIT? This would be my goal if it is.",

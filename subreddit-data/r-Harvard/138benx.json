That's why you are there. What got you there will take you to places in life as well. Being sad about being mediocre at Harvard is like being sad about being  a mediocre player in the NBA. Sure you may not be Lebron, but you can play in the national teams of every country and you would make a killing in European basketball. So chin up. Really. You are good. Really good. It just does not seem like it at the moment.",

And even Lebron could spend his time dwelling how there\u2019s someone in the history of basketball who did something better than him, or maybe he\u2019s insecure that he lacks other skills if he get\u2019s injured. The list goes on, no one is perfect, we can either spend our time thinking about what we don\u2019t have, or celebrate our strengths and cultivating them.",

In both situations, I had to carry all the weight of group projects. A few students really should not have been in college.\nBut then I do grad school at Harvard, and all the sudden I go from feeling like the smartest guy in the room to easily feeling like the dumbest. And you know what? That was a great experience. If you are the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room. \nSurrounding yourself with more talented, smarter, and harder working people will make you grow as a person. The universe is providing the challenge you need when you need it.",

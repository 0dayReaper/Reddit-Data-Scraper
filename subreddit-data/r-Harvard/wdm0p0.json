To my understanding, multiple readers review the Studio 10 recommendations, so more than one seasoned freshman writing instructor is predicting that you\u2019ll struggle to be successful in Expos 20 if you were to take it right now without any further preparation. You can decide that they are wrong or that you\u2019ll just struggle and get it over with, but they wouldn\u2019t be advising you to take 10 for any reason other than your benefit.",

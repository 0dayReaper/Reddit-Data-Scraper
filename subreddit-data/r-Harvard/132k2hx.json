    "postText": "Hi, waiting for the i-20 as an incoming GSAS student here! For folks who submitted the financial certification form early/mid April, have you received the i-20 yet? Does anyone know what the expected timeline for visa docs is?\n\nAlso, for people who have gone through this before, you know if the Notice of Financial Support from Harvard (PhD with full funding) is enough to get through the F1 visa process? I was notified that additional financial certification docs aren't needed unless you have dependents. Still, somewhat anxiously wondering if any additional bank letters are required for a solo F1 student further along.\n\nThank you!",

I emailed the GSAS contact and was told they expect to process those submissions and pass it along to the international office by early May. After that, my HIO advisor said they take about a week to send I-20s.\n\nAs for financial documents, I didn\u2019t upload anything since I also have full funding, and checking the amounts listed on the form, the grants and fellowships more than cover it. You shouldn\u2019t need anything else",

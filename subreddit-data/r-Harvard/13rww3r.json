After your first or second job you\u2019ll be in a better position to land at your tech company of choice. Tech companies aren\u2019t always the best place to start your career, but are great mid-career or later (my opinion)\n\n(~15 year Econ alum who was at McKinsey and eventually got into tech industry)",

I'd understand if you're a PM at a tech firm, but for someone targeting a software engineering role (like OP), wouldn't a direct-entry into tech propel their career further than brief stints at consulting/banking firms?",

Interns at bigger tech firms are much more cush, but only exposed to a sliver of the actual code base. It's really hard to get into a FAANG right out of school these days. I work for Google and most of my colleagues are on their 3rd or 4th job before coming here. Experience and industry knowledge is gonna get you further than doing LEET code unless your like in the .01%.",

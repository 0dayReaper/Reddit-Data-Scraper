    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nDoes auditing a class show up on your transcript? Sophomore here considering my options for taking a fifth class that I am really interested in (stat108) for a letter grade, sat/unsat, or auditing, and pros + cons of each. I'm not stats anything, just think it would be a helpful class to take given that I appreciated stat100 + might do some work with R over the summer, but my normal four courses are taken up by concentration reqs that I need to finish + I will likely have a busy sem outside of class as well. Thoughts? Any input would be loved lol.",

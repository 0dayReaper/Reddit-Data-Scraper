If you get a good one though, don\u2019t be afraid to reach out to them for anything! Also they aren\u2019t professionals in the courses, and they won\u2019t know what each class consists of, but they will tell you to have a well rounded schedule",

I met with my freshmen advisor a total of 2 times, and both of the meetings were non-consequential where we just made small talk.\n\nYour freshmen advisor will reach out to you at some point later in the summer.\n\nAs for other aspects of academic advising, you'll have to meet with a person affiliated with the department you're interested in concentrating in during the (late) spring.",

    "postText": "I\u2018m a junior now and been stressed about optimizing my college experience, and jealous of my peers here (I know a couple of people who have it all: 4.0 John Harvard scholars, are in the student orgs that are really hard to get into, have amazing internships, and on top of that are in final clubs). They make me feel like I won\u2019t be as successful as them in the future, but is it really so? Will they have better careers and make more money than someone with 3.6 GPA who wasn\u2019t in the exclusive clubs? How much all these metrics will matter in the grand scheme of things?",

And you can become successful by being good at \u2018only\u2019 one thing. \n\n\nFWIW, in the grand scheme of things, you're way closer \u2013 in terms of both current and predicted future attainment \u2013 to your 'aspirational' peers than you are to average folks. I'd try to re-center your 'success' measurement away from others, but if you can't, you still show very favorably.",

This may or may not sync up with a path planned to minimize any regrets. What'll make life interesting are the unexpected turns the path will take, how you deal with them, and what experiences you have that you did not anticipate. You will be ~21 when you graduate.

Work backwards from there.\n\nThe FOMO makes some--painful--sense if you are trying to keep your optionality open to literally be able to do anything.  But a) that isn't realistic and b) that probably isn't actually what you want!\n\nIf that thought experiment includes, e.g., law school or med school, then, yeah, you need to think really hard about GPA management.\n\nOr maybe you want to do quant/hft...OK, yes, you better be on the math/CS grind train (and generally have a sterling GPA).\n\nOTOH, if you're excited about the idea of doing a startup in the valley or helping running a political campaign or being a playwright in NYC...nope, matters very little.\n\nThe same logic follows for clubs and other activities.  (And, other than very specific careers, these matter vanishingly little once you leave.)\n\nYes, there is *always* going to be a sense of \"maybe I missed some super special connection/inspiration from something you didn't do\"...but that will hold for almost any way you spend your time.  \n\nThe value of spending your time in a focused manner &gt;&gt; serendipity (depth &gt; breadth), *in general* (and \"serendipity\"/luck tends to disproportionately come for the prepared mind, anyway).\n\nIf something seems *fun*...great, go do it!

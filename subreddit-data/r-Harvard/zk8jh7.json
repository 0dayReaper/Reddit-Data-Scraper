Does anyone know if any of the gyms (MAC, Hemenway, QRAC, etc.) have [woodway treadmills with the caterpillar type tread](https://cdn3.volusion.com/aqyor.dadrn/v/vspfiles/photos/WW-4FrontQuickSet-2.jpg?v-cache=1649708384)? Or any other nice treadmills? Or are they all your standard lifetime fitness sort of models?",

I can't speak to the specifics of HKS, but socially transitioning into any new program can be difficult. Give it time. If you still hate it after a semester, you can reevaluate.",

Interactions will get better and as you settle away from expectations and into your new reality\u2014I truly believe you will find comfort in change.\n\nChange in your intellectual curiosity and change in yourself as you push boundaries in interactions which, in the beginning, feel rivalrous and surface level.\n\nThere will come a time where you will be deep into research, projects, psets, or assignments with your peers\u2014these times are moments of growth and times you will develop a deeper connection with others. And you will find that your feelings are not so isolated and others will validate your feelings with their own experience/vulnerability.\n\nThe alternative is to lean in to comfort, lean in to what feels safe now; but ask yourself, who do you want to be and will your future self thank you dropping out? If the answer to the later is yes, then for sure transfer/drop out. However, remember why you started the program and know the future is not easily predicted. You had expectations of the program, and thus far, the beginning is not at all what you hoped for. This will happen again in the future, however, it will happen to be that your expectations of failure/disappointment are challenged. The future is not so easily predicted. Whatever you decide, I wish you the best.",

It took time to adjust to the networking, the unending parade of events, and to be honest\u2026not being the smartest person in the room anymore. Harvard is a place of incredible opportunity and that can be overwhelming to take in all at once. \n\nMy experience was that the feelings of alienation and anxiety about your program are temporary. You will find your way toward student and professional groups around campus that have people you can relate to and that will make life easier over time\u2026or you will become too busy to care by the end of October. \n\nTake a deep breath. You will find your path.",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm looking for flight tickets to go back to my home during winter recess. On the website it says that the examination period ends on December 17th (Saturday). I was wondering if we may have exams on December 17th.\n\n(I'm an international student, that's why I'm already looking for flight tickets. The sooner I but them, the cheaper they are)\n\nThanks!",

It's unusually early this year, most often the last day is the 20th.\n\nI'm not a student and don't recall how early the [final exam schedule](https://registrar.fas.harvard.edu/take-exams) is set.",

            "comment": "hey! idk if it's up on my.harvard yet, but iirc, it should say at the bottom of course descriptions when the final exam is scheduled (when they release it).\n\nif your course is project or essay-based, the instructor is likely totally fine with you taking off early as long as you submit your project on time (some even make their final assessment due during reading period), just clear it with them first. also, check syllabi and email instructors; most will tell you what they have in mind for deadlines wayyy before the schedule is released (frame it like you need to buy plane tickets while they're still affordable, which is true).\n\ni think you can petition ad board to reschedule an exam (for this sort of reason) once in your college career, but be forewarned that they will likely reschedule to the beginning of the following semester. i've also never tried this (so don't quote me, ymmv, etc.). your res dean (non first-years)/yard dean (first-years) prob has experience with this.",

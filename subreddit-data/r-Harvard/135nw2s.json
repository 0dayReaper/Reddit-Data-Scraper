    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI am a prefrosh who is planning on concentrating in Linguistics, and I was wondering which intro class was better. At Visitas, some people told me to take 83 and some said 101, and reading the course descriptions on my.harvard, it seems they are very similar courses. I also read the q scores and they seem pretty similar. Which is better to take, and is it worth it to take both or are they essentially the same course?",

            "comment": "Hey! As a ling concentrator (we\u2019re far and few in between) I can tell you they\u2019re essentially the same class. Ling 83 has some more emphasis on the cognition part of language for like the first two weeks and has a final project instead of a final exam, but other than that they\u2019re made to be interchangeable so their contents are in line with one another, they\u2019re both broad-sweeping intros to the field.\n\nAlso, if you already have some background in linguistics (or are willing to put it in over the summer) you can skip them entirely and move onto the 100 series classes, which are more focused on one specific area of the field and may cater more to you if you have specific interests. In terms of your concentration, that\u2019d mean you have to take an extra ling course at some point in the future instead of 101/83 but that should not be an issue.\n\nHope this helped, feel free to DM!",

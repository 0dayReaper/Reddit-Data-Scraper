None of this seems to be good judgement. \n\nAnyways, there\u2019s always paperwork with money this size. I\u2019d return the money if I were her.",

From the Crimson reports, it seems like there's enough evidence to get her for wire fraud/embezzlement/criminal conversion. Maybe there's more to this story than what's being reported?\n\nApparently Harvard PD opened a case against her last month but it was closed without action",

In any case, whether the money is returned or not, I think that there's going to be a considerable hit on the former president's reputation based on the fact that there was a payment for a clear non-club-related expense in their hometown. If I were her, I would do what it takes to return the money. $30k is pennies compared to the damage in reputation.",

Transferring $30,000 of the HUFPI's funds to her personal account, regardless of whether she returns some or all if it, is potentially a crime and should be investigated.  Her later actions add to the presumption of wrongdoing.",

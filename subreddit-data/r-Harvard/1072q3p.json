    "postText": "Hello folks --\n\nFor the past few years, I've been removing posts that are news articles about Harvard if they are not from The Crimson or if there isn't a corresponding story in The Crimson about it. The reason for this is that otherwise we would get too many news articles from outlets that like to include \"Harvard\" in their article title, and karma farmers who cross post those sorts of things.\n\nThe other reason I do this is because generally The Crimson is a pretty good standard for news about Harvard -- if it is truly Harvard-related and important, the Crimson will report on it; if not, then it won't. So that's why we have this unwritten rule in place. \n\nIt was brought to my attention that this should probably be clarified in our rules on the sidebar. So this post just a notice to everyone that I am adding that as a rule, unless enough people are against it and we need to rethink it.\n\nThanks, and let us know if you have any feedback here.",

They often cover news about faculty and research publications that may or may not be covered by the Crimson.\n\nApart from that I don\u2019t feel strongly one way or the other about external news sources. Another thing you could allow are other Harvard student publications. There\u2019s also the art magazines, which don\u2019t cover news, but people may want to share their work here?",

Obviously your standard \"Harvard Professor says you should eat 36 cockroaches a day\" nonsense should be completely excluded, but I've seen articles that have significant reference to Harvard as a University which have not been picked up by the Gazette. \n\nWould limiting articles just to local Boston news sources like the Globe be a possibility?",

I can add some reputable Boston news sources to the approved list as well.\n\nHowever, we still might remove those on a case by case basis. Sometimes they can still be \"only kind of relevant\" and better suited to another subreddit.",

            "comment": "I disagree with the Crimson holding the standard for what's newsworthy. They do a good job on campus life, admin news, and faculty scandals - but they don't actually cover research news that well. They also ignore a lot of events, and their coverage depends on their publication calendar. If a news event happens during break, they won't cover it until weeks or months later.\n\nI think a better way would be to allow news articles from reputable journalistic sources, and adopt a rule against obvious click-bait and news aggregator sources with no obvious editorial oversight. \n\nFor a sub that's regularly critiqued for being dead, heavy-handed link moderation seems like unnecessary gatekeeping.",

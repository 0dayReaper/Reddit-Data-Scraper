Harvard and Radcliffe houses were integrated by then, but just barely. It would make sense that a young lady would have a full seven digit number. The campus extension to Mass Hall\u2019s apartment at A-43 appears to have been 83619. That would probably have been a male classmate. I gather the OP\u2019s father was a first year when he kept this notebook.",

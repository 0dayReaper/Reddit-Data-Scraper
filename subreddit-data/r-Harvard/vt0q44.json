People concentrating in CS or engineering or pursuing the pre-med track will typically take 2-3 pset courses each semester. \n\nFor reference, in my first year, I took 3 pset courses in the fall and 2 in the spring (as a prospective CS major). The workload was fine because I tend to start problem sets as early as possible. I also don't have much of social life (in terms of going out or partying), so I had plenty of time to finish assignments.\n\nIf you're on the more social or procrastinating end, then multiple pset courses won't be a fit for you.",

I don't like advancing this notion that you can't do STEM if you wanna have fun in college. That is absolutely not true and dissuades people from studying STEM subjects. \n\nObviously, on average, hard-STEM courses will take more time than paper-based ones, but if you're on top of your time management, start work early, and make use of your day efficiently, you can certainly carve out time for social activities.",

Unless you\u2019re doing stat 110 CS 61 and like some other CS class all at the same time, most combinations of classes allow plenty of social time. On the contrary to yourself, i took 2-3 every semester, and I procrastinate a decent amount, and still managed to do everything in a reasonable amount of time. \n\nI think these answers are highly variable, but seems the average recommended is 2-3 courses, and how hard they are remains tbd",

Keep in mind that any class that isn't a pset course will typically hit you with multiple papers, the longest of which will likely be due during reading period.\n\nPersonally I found the best way was to stick with at most 3 in a semester if one of the classes is on the more difficult side of psets, but you could get away with 4 if none are particularly difficult.",

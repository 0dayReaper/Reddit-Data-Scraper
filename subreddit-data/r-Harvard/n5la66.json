Please note, however, that these students may be subject to additional requirements, such as more frequent testing, until they are considered fully protected by a vaccine.",

It makes sense that a vaccine should only be accepted if its efficacy and safety has been independently verified. I wonder if the WHO might authorize more vaccines in time for it to count. If not, those students will be further along in [becoming invincible](https://www.tiktok.com/@richblackguy/video/6950024923339443462).",

                    "comment": "You make a fair point, although shipping out whatever vaccines we have won't significantly affect the mutation rate in other countries. First of all India has 1.37 billion people, so we couldn't get nearly enough vaccines over there to make a sizeable dent in population immunity. Second, even if we did, there are likely enough anti-vaxxers there (or anywhere really except maybe the one sane country NZ) to let the virus continue to propagate and mutate. Unfortunately this pandemic seems to have become a game of everyone for themselves, on basically every level of society, from individual/family to state to country.\n\nI think there are much bigger forces at play here than just Harvard's decision to require the vaccine. Other universities have already made this decision before Harvard, so (1) Harvard is doing this to basically be politically in line with what's considered \"good\", but also (2) taking advantage of the Biden-mandated widespread availability of vaccines.",

I was thinking more like an 80-20 type thing where by just vaccinating like 20% of the population (the most at risk people), you could eliminate 80% of excess mortality, etc. I agree though that herd immunity seems pretty unlikely, even in the US where access to vaccines is excellent in most parts of the country. Certainly Harvard's official position is not going to be the consequential from a global standpoint, but it is interesting to me that these ethical discussions aren't even really being had; speaks to your point of everyone for themselves.",

So yes they reversed course which I suppose is good news (although imo is the bare minimum considering what they\u2019re realistically capable of) but the change still doesn\u2019t affect graduates after the class of 2022.",

As a result of this research, the University will create a new partnership with an external email forwarding service that we are confident will add significant value to this program. In a phased approach, we will be offering this service first to the Classes of 2021, 2022, and 2023, after which we will migrate existing users. Starting in 2024, we will open up the service to all eligible alumni.",

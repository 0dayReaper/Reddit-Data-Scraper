            "comment": "The common joint concentrations with Statistics are CS (most common) and Math (second most common). There are a few Stat/Gov concentrators per year. There would probably be a lot of joint Stat/Econ and Stat/Applied Math concentrators, but Econ and AM don't allow joint concentrations.\n\nJoint concentrations between Stat and humanities concentrations are rare. But on rare occasions there have been joint concentrations such as Stat/English, Stat/Classics, Stat/HAA, and even Stat/TDM.\n\nWith double concentrations now allowed by the College, it is now somewhat more feasible to combine a STEM field and a humanities field (without having to write a senior thesis integrating the two fields). And we are now starting to have, e.g., Stat/Econ double concentrators.",

Harvard\u2019s philosophy department is very well-renowned for mathematical logic, meaning that there are people working on set theory, pure logic, etc. In addition, Bayesian epistemology and philosophy of probabilities are huge topics in philosophy and there are professors in the department who have worked on both of those areas.",

    "postText": "Hello just another frosh asking about dorms! Didn\u2019t see a post about Hollis and I couldn\u2019t really find anything online about it except it being supposedly one of the worst dorms, which doesn\u2019t make me very excited as someone who got it haha. (I\u2019m in room 04 which is in the first floor i believe.) \n\nTalked with a upperclassman and he told me that he thought it was actually one of the best due to size of the doubles and location. What should I think? Is it a good dorm or not? \n\nAlso, I\u2019m very curious about the social life at Hollis. Does everybody get to know each other usually, do any parties happen there, etc. \n\nThank you!",

Goated\"\n\nWhen I went to the room, it was pretty big for a double and the overall layout was nice. You could probably have two visitors stay overnight in sleeping bags/ air mattresses pretty comfortably.",

Super central location (you\u2019re about halfway between the square and annenberg). Rooms are MASSIVE. Probably the biggest rooms of any freshman dorm, other than the overflow dorms which were basically full appartements. They don\u2019t put ppl in dorms based on how social they are so social life will obv vary, but my entryway (basically the ~30 ppl off the same stairway as you) was very close, made a lot of friends especially on my floor. All my other friends were jealous of how big my room was, and there were almost always parties in my entryway every weekend night bc the rooms are really great for hosting.",

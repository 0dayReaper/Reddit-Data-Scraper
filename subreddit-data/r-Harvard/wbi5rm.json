    "postText": "Hey!\n\nYes, another Freshman asking about dorms. I didn't see anyone post about Weld recently, so I thought I'd ask. (Also, this post is mostly out of my impatience. I really just want to be on campus and I'm trying to learn as much as I can about it to satiate that incessant desire!).\n\nI was assigned to Weld in a five person suite - so excited! If anyone has experience with Weld and/or living in a space with a large amount of people, I would appreciate hearing about it! Advice, how to keep the space clean, whether to grab a microfridge...etc. etc.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Weld is a great dorm! Had a bunch of friends there and used to hang there a lot. Will say a 5 person suite is likely to get pretty dirty so you should figure out garbage rotations early. Also might be a good idea to get 2 of the HSA microfridges instead of 1 with that many people",

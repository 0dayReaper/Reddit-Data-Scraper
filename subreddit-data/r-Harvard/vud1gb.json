Most students work to meet their student contribution, and jobs on campus are plentiful and varied. Some students use outside awards or loans to meet their expected contributions. If you can't save up enough for your student contribution, the Harvard Loan program may be able to help.\n\nSo it's not billed but it says that I'm expected to contribute, so do I have to pay the $3,500 cost if I choose not to work? Also they only talk about outside awards and loans, can't I just simply pay directly? It's just $3,500, even though I qualify for total financial aid that's little money and I can pay it.",

It is simply the amount of money you can make working a federal work study job. If you do not work, nothing happens except maybe you run out of money, but the 3500 is a very generous estimate on expenditures you may have.",

    "postText": "Hi I have a new project to share.\n\nIs this how you feel when using My.Harvard?\n\n*I just want to take a class about*\u00a0***\\[X\\]***\u00a0*but searching the online catalog is so slow, and my results are largely irrelevant. WTF?*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/29xv56ytcph91.png?width=1808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ee4fcd6ddd96f41805bde7e279868b2d3765ad4d\n\nThen use\u00a0[https://classes.wtf](https://classes.wtf/)\u00a0and get search results for your courses, 3x faster than you can blink.\u00a0And it has full-text search by default. You can filter by attributes like subject, instructor, class level, and semester. I aim to have search algorithm quality that is\u00a0*better*\u00a0than My.Harvard\u2019s search.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xtyyaq6qcph91.png?width=1571&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6137d31af10ff96b489f2c607411f0c566cfd5a5\n\nThis is completely free. I don\u2019t make any money on this, nor do I track you with analytics. I\u2019m running servers in multiple locations around the world so that you can have ultra-fast search (limited by the speed of light). This is paid for out-of-pocket.\n\nHave fun and consider sharing with friends if this helps you! :)\n\n[**classes.wtf**](https://classes.wtf/)",

            "comment": "Feel you, today I got rejected from one of the social orgs too, just after the first round. It feels so embarrassing in a way, like something is wrong with my personality. Especially because I know quite a few people from that org I started to feel so inadequate and couldn\u2019t figure out why they got in and I didn\u2019t. Also it hurt when the friend I brought as a plus one actually got to the next round and I didn\u2019t. After calling my mum about it for an hour lol it just seems like Harvard is weird. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re doing anything wrong, the system is just stupid. Maybe we dodged a bullet; let\u2019s make friends that we don\u2019t have to pay for (as the fees for these orgs seem to be rather high), and thinking of the class sizes and how many people actually are in an RSO, it\u2019s probably 10% max of the whole student population, so let\u2019s vibe with the other 90% instead",

            "comment": "What kind of things did you talk about during recruitment rounds? I\u2019ve noticed that people tend to be less successful when they only talk about classes or extracurriculars\u2014 you might think that you\u2019re showing off your personality, but the recruiter might leave the conversation not knowing if you\u2019re someone they would have fun with/not have a good sense of who you actually are. Also, recruiters are going to try to make you feel welcome so you feeling like the conversation went well doesn\u2019t always mean the recruiter learned what they were hoping to learn about you. Recruiters are often looking for people they can see themselves having fun with, possibly drinking and going to parties with, etc. I\u2019d much rather hear about how much you love traveling and hanging out with friends by going out to eat than about what classes you\u2019re in, or about the nitty gritty of you being premed. Tell me about yourself, not who you are in classes, because that\u2019s probably not the person I\u2019ll be hanging out with in the RSO. \n\nAlso know, it\u2019s not weird to try to join twice! People probably won\u2019t remember you a whole year later so you\u2019ll have a pretty clean slate. It\u2019s a whole other thing about whether it\u2019s worth it to you, but I don\u2019t think people will look at you funny for trying twice (and if they do, that\u2019s their problem not yours).",

While I\u2019ve not been a student here (rather a professor), my suggestion is to just focus on building a social community beyond the structure of these types of orgs, making friends in classes, volunteering in the community, etc. (if you haven\u2019t already). For what it\u2019s worth, I made my closest friends and found my communities in my second year of undergrad, so just hang in there!",

After all, we can all probably think of at least one instance where our natural personality wasn't taken well too; I have a very bubbly friend (peppy, optimistic, giggly, etc), for instance, whose pep was sometimes taken as being fake. On the other hand, I'm a fairly serious person who can also be forgetful, and I've had cases where people accused me of \"withholding information\" because I genuinely forgot and wasn't warm enough where it could be instantaneously excused. You can't win all the time. \n\nAs for clout and personality markers...So I did my undergrad at another very elite but non-Harvard institute, so I can't speak for the specifics of the organizations you're looking at. I'm sure being rich, white, and famous would help, but based off similar organizations at my home institute, I'd say a very important personality marker would be [ease.](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/09/blame-the-bobos-creative-class/619492/) \n\n&gt; the knowledge of how to act in open environments where the rules are disguised\n\n&gt; A student who possesses ease can walk into any room and be confident that she can handle whatever situation she finds. She knows how to structure relationships with teachers and other professional superiors so that they are treated both as authority figures and as confidants. A student in possession of ease can comfortably engage the cafeteria workers with a distant friendliness that at once respects social hierarchy and pretends it doesn\u2019t exist. A student with ease knows when irony is appropriate, what historical quotations are overused, how to be unselfconscious in a crowd.\n\nA huge part of this IMO is coming across as \"conventional,\" and being white especially helps with that. Wealth, especially being comfortable with it, helps a ton in mingling as well. \n\nIndividual student groups also often have their own culture, and they'll gravitate towards people that fit that culture (i.e., \"click\" with the current members on a deep level). \n\nOf course I don't know you personally, but I'm sure you're doing fine socially. I highly doubt there's any particular aspect of socializing or personality that you don't get, as much as...You're in the Harvard bubble, essentially. Most of the kids here are super polished. IMO it's part of why they got in. Like the undergrads I've met and taught here...they're not all super smart, but they more often than not can talk their way through things and also seem nice and affable. If you went elsewhere, you'd see that a lot of people genuinely aren't that smooth at interacting. You just happen to be among a crowd of very charismatic people. \n\nClout markers would just be things like, flashy accomplishments. Student life involvement (like are you in other exclusive groups?). Big things (6 figure book deals,  famous dancer, etc). That sort of thing.",

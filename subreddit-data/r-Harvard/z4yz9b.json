Here's where you'll get sent if you submit a ticket, it's their standard response and it usually works:\n\nPC\nhttps://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/How-do-I-clear-my-browser-cache-on-a-PC/ta-p/48\n\nMac\nhttps://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/How-do-I-clear-my-browser-cache-on-a-Mac/ta-p/43\n\nLast thing to check is any weird extensions added. Error 400 is a bad request, which means the server is confused by what it's being sent. If it's one of the Canvas systems, they seem to get confused a lot and especially with chrome.",

    "postText": "Hi! Thought I\u2019d hop on here for some advice. For context, I\u2019m interested in concentrating in Econ, ESPP, or Physics as a pre-med. I don\u2019t want my course load for the first semester to be too difficult because I\u2019d like a (relatively) smooth transition into college. Please let me know if there are any options I may not have considered! I've got a few dilemmas. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve got:\n\n1. **LS1A** \\- placed into this, rite of passage for premeds. I\u2019ll probably have to take this one freshman fall regardless\n2. **Math** \\- I tested out of 1b, so I\u2019ve got so so many options. Some top contenders\n   1. Math 18a - seems cool based on the syllabus and QGuide comments, fulfills a concentration requirement and if I take Math 18b/19b in the spring, I can place out of the really difficult intro Stat classes. The biggest issue with Math 18a is that it is also at the same time as Econ 10a.\n   2. Math 19b - not sure if I want to take this, but it's a worthy option. Heard that it's multi + some biology-related readings each week. Feedback on QGuide is significantly more negative than 18a.\n   3. Math 21a - this one would probably give me the most flexibility if I wanted to change my concentration? fulfills a requirement for honors in Econ (but this would also be fulfilled by Math 18a). 3 psets a week\n   4. Math 22a - more theoretical math and more proofs than 21a, 1 pset per week, well taught judging by QGuide.\n   5. An applied math intro course? Not familiar with them and not sure which would be a good fit\n3. **Introductory Concentration Course**\n   1. Econ 10a - I have a 5 on AP Macro, so I won't have to take Econ 10b. Unfortunately, this class overlaps with Math 18a. Could possibly take 10a in the spring to avoid overlap with 18a?\n   2. ESPP gened\n4. **Freshman Seminar**",

            "comment": "i think ec10 is a simultaneous enrollment class, so you could still take it even though it's at the same time as math 18a and just watch the ec10 lecture recordings instead.\n\ni will also put in a good word for math 22a tho\u2014 i really enjoyed the class, the instructor is great, and i knew a bunch of physics majors who took 22a",

I can\u2019t speak to 18a or 19b, but I had a great experience with Math 21a. This can vary a lot though with many different people teaching it, but if you felt comfortable with calculus in high school, it shouldn\u2019t be a huge leap forward. 21a is also probably better then 18 or 19 if you choose to go the physics route",

I heard that they are restructuring 21b but unsure of when that will go into effect. \n\nYour schedule looks good. The seminar will take some pressure off, but only take if you are genuinely interested in the topic.",

            "comment": "Since you\u2019re still exploring what you\u2019re interested in, then maybe Math 21a is the way to go! The content overlaps for 2/3 of the semester with 18a, but for the last 1/3 of the semester, 18a goes more into economics. If you know you\u2019re premed tho and if that\u2019s not going to change, I\u2019d suggest 19a. I\u2019m premed (rising sophomore) taking 19a next year. I haven\u2019t rly heard good things about 22a though, so only take it if you have experience writing proofs. \n\nI got a 5 on Macro too and I took Ec10a in the fall. I think it\u2019s a really good class and worth to try it out since so many people take it. It did make me realize I didn\u2019t want a secondary in econ, though. You can do simultaneous enrollment, and lectures are posted so you can watch the videos later in the day. Even if you don\u2019t end up liking it, you at least got the social sciences divisional distribution requirement done with!\n\nBy ESPP gened do you mean a GENED course that counts as a course towards the ESPP concentration?\n\nOnly do a freshman seminar you\u2019re truly interested in. Look at the syllabus and do one that really speaks to you. People who do so will really love it, but I know people who took a seminar and didn\u2019t enjoy it as much because they took it for the sake of taking a seminar",

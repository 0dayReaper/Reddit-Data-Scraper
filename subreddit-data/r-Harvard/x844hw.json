    "postText": "I understand that CSE SM is focused more on the computational aspects of development and modeling. But I'm looking for insights on how the job placements, class culture, coding/mathematical rigor, and acceptance rate varies in each program. What are the typical JDs of a CSE grad vs a DS grad?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from that, any information except that on the website would be great. I would also love to connect with any alumni from either course!",

            "comment": "I was in the 2 year CSE program so I can talk a bit about it. When I was there, many people in CSE took data science courses, and many in data science took CSE-related courses. The difference between the two programs can be incredibly small if you want it to be. That said, CSE does offer more flexibility in terms of what courses you can take, especially in the two year program.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClass culture was incredibly collaborative and the department does a great job of fostering this through final projects in virtually every class. Most people also realize how incredible of a networking opportunity a place like Harvard is and take advantage of it. I found people tended to be very friendly as well. People also come from a very diverse background, some direct from undergrad, others from various industries, some after completing other advanced degrees, or seeking a total career shift. This brings a lot of different perspectives to each cohort.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would say difficulty (I'm assuming this is what you mean by rigor) of the core courses is fairly high. There's a lot more to data science than just training models, so its not as mathematically intense as, say, an ML theory course, but it's still math heavy. AM205 and AM207 will likely be quite difficult if you don't have a solid background in numerical methods or bayesian statistics, respectively. Both are doable, though. The programming is largely numerical methods and machine learning in flavor, so you'll be writing your fair share of code too. For courses outside of the CSE/DS core, rigor can be whatever you want and you can cross-register at MIT as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAcceptance rate for both programs is &lt;10%, IIRC. Data science is larger, so I believe it's more difficult to get into.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor job placement, that'll depend on which courses you take and how you prepare for interviews. I didn't really notice much difference between DS and CSE, most employers don't really differentiate either from what I have seen/heard. A lot end up in consulting or data scientist roles (for both CSE and DS). From memory, more CSE students went on to pursue PhDs than DS students. Placement is great at both top universities and companies/firms, depending on which route you take",

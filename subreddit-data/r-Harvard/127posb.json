They\u2019re just out of touch and choose not to prioritize the financial wellbeing of their students.\n\nI also wouldn\u2019t consider a university\u2019s name to be a good justification for underpaying. If anything, a university like Harvard has the resources to pay comfortable wages, if only they cared. The other offers I mentioned would provide the same opportunities as Harvard.

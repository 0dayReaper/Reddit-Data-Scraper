    "postText": "Hey, everyone. Prospective student here, interested in the Chemistry and Physics concentration even though I lean a bit more towards physics than chemistry. I've heard nothing but positive things about the physics department, so I've got a few questions and if you've got the time, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could answer any of them, either here or via PM. \n\n1. What is your favourite thing about your department/concentration? Least favourite thing? \n2. What exactly being a Chemistry and Physics concentrator entails as opposed to doing either one separately or as a joint major?\n3. Most memorable course or experience?\n4. Any advice for incoming students?\n\nPlease feel free to add literally anything else that you would like to, as anything you say will probably be of great contribution. Thanks for taking the time to read this and while I completely understand if this is not possible, on the off chance that is for one of you, I would seriously be super grateful if I could borrow a few minutes of your time to talk about your experiences with your concentration. \n\nOnce again, thank you.",

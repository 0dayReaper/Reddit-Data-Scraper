Whatever the recommendation, it is ultimately up to you to decide whether you take Expos Studio 10 or Expos 20. I mean, what did you say in the writing exam?",

Easier transition vs. best-fitting course given past writing experiences. \n\nI would think that someone who has taken Expos Studio 10 would give you the perspective of someone who was a good fit for the course. If you might actually fit better in Expos 20, then you will obviously have an easier time taking Studio 10.",

You can probably pick one up off the rack and get it tailored with like two weeks notice. I personally love the look though so I find any excuse to attend black tie events.",

I would bring a suit if you have one, and some nice clothes, but don\u2019t worry too much. Think about a formal dance where everyone dresses up. Certainly wouldnt call this high society since you can get away with not wearing a suit to anything, but i think having one was nice. \n\nYou\u2019ll probably get a water bottle but pro tip dont leave it out in the sun, or else youll have to clean it way more often. Clean it regularly but you dont need to do it every day. Pretty sure most dorms have small kitchens tucked away somewhere anyways. Again, probably not much to worry about",

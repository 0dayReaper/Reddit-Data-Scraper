Harvard brings in twice or three times as much donation money every year compared to most other US colleges: https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/2/8/harvard-fundraising-tops-stanford/\n\nBecause of this, Harvard probably leads US colleges in gifts received from almost any source. If you recompute the figures as a percentage of gifts received, Harvard is no longer at the top of the list.",

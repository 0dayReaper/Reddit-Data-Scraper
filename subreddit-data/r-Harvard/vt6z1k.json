            "comment": "I took the class without much programming experience (all I had taken was CS50) and for me the class was very challenging due to the content and how new information is supposed to be learned. I walked away not liking the class. Since then, as I gained exposure to other languages and how good code is written, I realize that CS51 actually covers a lot of important topics and teaches them fairly well. While it may seem dumb learning Ocaml, with expose to more languages, it is easy to see the transferability between languages regarding the concepts taught.",

Every person I have spoken to who took 51 has said they are not a fan of the course and that they feel it added unnecessary stress to their life/drained their time, and it does not seem that they had a programming advantage over me in higher level courses (I do have a good amount of experience with python by self-teaching after CS 50).\n\nFurthermore, in the new CS requirements CS 51 doesn\u2019t do anything for you credit-wise if you plan on taking CS 50 and CS 61, which is a good idea since 61 (though quite difficult) is a very well-liked course that also satisfies the systems requirement.\n\nTo me, taking 51 seems to not be the best option for many if not the majority of people.",

I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the format of the class (almost no lectures, taught mostly through labs). But as I have been trying to learn some more programming over the summer, I find myself picking up languages/frameworks a lot easier",

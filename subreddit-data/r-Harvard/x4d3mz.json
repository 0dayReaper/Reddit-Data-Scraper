    "postText": "Context: The president of Mexico has a daily morning \"press conference\", which is broadcast on social networks (but in reality it is propaganda for him, his political party or his interests) and in one of them he exclaimed that people who study at Harvard learn to steal.\n\nMore context: Of course, the consensus of rational Mexicans is that these words are absolute nonsense, however, in this period, unfortunately, many irrational people are sharing this kind of speech by the president.\n\nThese speeches are a way of indoctrinating the exaltation of patriotism/nationalism, where the rhetoric is that foreigners are \"evil by nature\" and thay \"they prevent us from developing because they only want to take advantage of us\", in addition to demeaning the education, in a country like Mexico where half of its population only completes the first half of secondary education, this kind of speech in general mobilizes the masses who are looking for an imaginary enemy, generates feelings on ignorant people and unfortunately increases the popularity of the president. \n\nAs a Mexican, I would like to hear your comments, this video has been around for a long time, it was on the news in our country and yet I never heard an official response from Harvard or its community, I would really like to see what you think without holding back. Thank you.",

An education just allows you to better understand how things work and what the likely outcome will be better than someone without it.\n\nIf you're playing a game of Monopoly with people who don't know you want to buy the railroads first, they'll often get upset even if they're happy when they're selling you their railroad.

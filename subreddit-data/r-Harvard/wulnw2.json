            "comment": "Unless you are concentrating in physics, there's no need for Physics 16. And even if you **are** concentrating in physics, 15a gets you to the same place. Don't let hubris get in your way.\n\nBoth 15a and 16 are well more advanced than AP Physics C, and neither is a light workload, but 16 is much more work than 15a\n\nAs for math, that's personal preference based upon your experience with proofs. If you're comfortable with them, opt for 22a; if not, go with 21a.",

If no, go with option 1.\n\nIf you\u2019re confident in your math and logic skills enough for Math 22a, could you say the same for chemistry and physics? Have you taken intensive courses in each before? Would taking Physics 15a or PS11 feel redundant?\n\nOption 2 seems like the one that would be least overkill. From what I\u2019ve heard about PS10, it\u2019s not pretty. Same goes for Math 22A and Physics 16 tho. The combination of them all seems troubling",

If you would be comfortable with a bit of proof-based maths I would recommend considering: Physics 15a, Math 22a, PS10, Freshman Seminar. To my knowledge Math 21 has three psets a week plus a weekly pset, whereas 22 only has one pset a week, so while it\u2019s not easy, it might make your schedule more manageable. I agree with what others have said about Physics 16 vs 15a too.",

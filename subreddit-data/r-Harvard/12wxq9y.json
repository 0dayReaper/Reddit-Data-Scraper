    "postText": "Hi all! Like most people on this sub in the past month, I'm an admitted prefrosh considering attending Harvard. I'm definitely leaning toward it but something that's holding me back is the alleged [lack of undergraduate club funding](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/5/23/yir-student-funding/)/[hot mess that appears to be the UC or HUA](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/2/28/hernandez-clubs-funding-jobs/). Maybe it's just the people I've talked to, but I've heard that most clubs (sports/service/just for fun) get very little funding outside of the popular ones like The Crimson and pre-professional clubs that are self-financed. Can someone dispel or attest to this claim?\n\nI'm particularly interested in progressive advocacy and volunteering groups. 1) Is social justice advocacy work popular on campus? I'm a little scared by how dominant consulting and finance groups (ngl literally the antithesis of what I aspire toward) seem to be. 2) Are volunteering groups funded? I know that at some similar colleges, clubs can get thousands of dollars to cover volunteering trips across the country.\n\nIf anyone is involved with anything related, I would love to get in touch! Thanks so much!",

So I would recommend trying to reach out more directly to current students and faculty to get a better sense of things.",

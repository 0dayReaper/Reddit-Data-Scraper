            "comment": "Well, I'm not Egyptian nor have I accepted the Egypt public service fellowship, but I did once accidentally order a falafel wrap with extra hot sauce, so I feel like I have a deep connection to the culture.  Does that count? One tip. When asking about their experience during studies, why not just ask how people from the Middle East, in general, fared? Also, overall, the process of passing the program and interviewing is likely to be the same as what many other people in similar degree programs are facing in other universities and so you might want to broaden your search to other university reddit forums.\n\n**Update:** I don't want to participate in this forum very much. I have probably been blocked in some way here, and I don't have the time to argue the mods about this particular issue. So, I will just update my comment in place here.  \nNow, regarding your comment \"My question was pretty straightforward. You don't seem to have an answer\", my comment on broadening your search to other university reddit forums seems reasonable given that you have received few replies. The rest of my comment was just a humorous reply. You can ignore it.",

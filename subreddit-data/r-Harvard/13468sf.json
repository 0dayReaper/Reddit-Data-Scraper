    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am a pre-frosh interested in pursuing finance (investment banking, PE, VC, etc). I really like math and did very well in advanced math classes throughout high school (I am in calc3/multivariable right now). Right now, I am leaning towards an Applied Math concentration with a specialization in econ. Does anyone have experience with this concentration? If so, what classes did you take freshman year?\n\nThanks",

I recommend taking the appropriate math intro course (math 21,22,25,etc) and some econ course. if you\u2019re pretty confident you might be able to take ec 1011a, otherwise maybe take stat 110. advisors will help you.",

Would focus on getting a high gpa even if in a random concentration, and cross registering at MIT for as many business / accounting courses as possible.",

But in terms of being prepared to hit the ground running day one of your finance career, harvard is not the right choice. Any undergrad business program (Georgetown, BC, USC, etc.) is 100% better if you want to actually prepare for a career in finance. It\u2019s too bad that harvard doesn\u2019t dedicate any classes to prepping kids for finance, even though that\u2019s one of the top exit routes for each graduating class.",

    "postText": "Help Me Choose: Harvard vs. Yale vs. Stanford\n\nI was accepted to these schools with very generous financial aid (full rides or nearly full rides for each school.) I love so many aspects of all three of these schools so it\u2019s going to be very hard to choose!\n\nIntended major: **neuroscience** (symsys at Stanford) but I might consider cognitive science, psychology or computer science. Im interested in working in a hospital as some type of clinician, but I\u2019m also interested in **biotech** and might want to see what consulting has to offer me. I might go **pre-med**.\n\nImportant things I want:\n\n*Support for FGLI students, a non-elitist culture\n\n*Strong Black community\n\n*Support for students with learning disabilities/ neurodivergent students\n\n*Good social scene (I want to party weekly)\n\n **HARVARD**\n\n*Pros of Harvard:*\n\n*Black community seems strong\n\n*Really cool classes in every major I\u2019m considering\n\n*Many research opportunities\n\n*Close to biotech/neuroscience opportunities\n\n*Close to home\n\n*Cons of Harvard*\n\n*The social scene isn\u2019t as good as yale \n\n*Competitive culture?, rumored to be grad-school focused?\n\n*The food is apparently not great\n\n **STANFORD**\n\n*Pros of Stanford*\n\n*Black affinity housing that I\u2019d love to try\n\n*Plenty of majors I can try. The classes sound so enriching!\n\n*Their SymSys/CS/psychology/HumanBio opportunities are really appealing\n\n*CS coterm sounds cool!\n\n*Higher FGLI population\n\n*Quarter system makes studying abroad easy\n\n*Cons of Stanford*\n\n*Quarter system \u2014&gt; hard to line up breaks with my friends/ less rest between academic periods\n\n*Black community isn\u2019t as large as Harvard\u2019s, doesn\u2019t seem as closeknit as Yale\u2019s (correct me if I\u2019m wrong)\n\n*Culture seems influenced by Silicon Valley/tech bros\n\n*Far from home\n\n*Worried about student culture: is stanford v preprofessional? Does everyone worry about getting a career and forget to have fun?\n\n*Social scene isn\u2019t as robust as yale\n\n **YALE**\n\n*Pros of Yale*\n\n*Close to home\n\n*Love the residential college system\n\n*Its culture (artsy, liberal arts) aligns with my vibe\n\n*Campus is beautiful\n\n*Love the black community!\n\n*Strong support for FGLI students\n\n*Love the social scene\n\n*Cons of yale*\n\n*Neuroscience/CS/Biology program isn\u2019t as strong as Harvard and Stanford\n\n*Unlike Harvard/Stanford it\u2019s not near a career hub that I\u2019m interested in",

Lobster roll night was amazing. Crawdads Cajun style were out of this world. Prime rib being sliced in front of us in line was great. Not every night was like that, but those are all meals I had while an undergrad from 2016-2020. Sorry that Eliot had the best food.",

They revamped the menu very recently, and the grills (especially Quincy grill)/Harvard square always have good food. There's also tons of free &amp; good food you can find at club &amp; speaker events. \n\n\\- Social scene: even if harvard's not throwing that weekend (which we usually are), you can always go to other Boston schools. MIT &amp; BU typically throw some pretty great frat parties, but I'm sure other schools do as well. It's one of the perks about being in Boston (of which there are many). \n\n\\- culture: I think there will always be a subsect of Harvard that's fairly competitive, but you can definitely find people that are laid back and very chill as well. I imagine that's true for most schools, though. I also don't feel like the purported 'grad school focus' affects my experience at the school all that much to be considered a con. There is no dearth of opportunities to explore as an undergrad, and you can cross-enroll at the grad schools + MIT &amp; other Boston schools as well.",

            "comment": "I would say -- all three are good choices.\n\nHere is what a leading A.I. program had to say.\n\n\"Congratulations on being accepted to Harvard, Yale, and Stanford with such generous financial aid offers! It's understandable that choosing between these three prestigious universities can be challenging, but considering your intended major and important criteria, let's break down the pros and cons of each school to help you make an informed decision.\n\nStarting with Harvard, it offers a strong black community and many research opportunities in your areas of interest, including neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology, and computer science. Additionally, it's close to biotech and neuroscience hubs and located near your home, which can make visiting easier. However, Harvard's social scene might not be as robust as Yale's, and there's a perception that the culture is highly competitive and focused on graduate school. Furthermore, the food may not be as great as you would like.\n\nMoving on to Stanford, it also offers a strong black community, with the added benefit of black affinity housing. Stanford has an impressive array of majors that you can explore, and their SymSys, CS, psychology, and HumanBio programs are all highly regarded. Additionally, Stanford has a higher FGLI population, and the quarter system can make studying abroad more accessible. However, the quarter system might make it hard to coordinate breaks with friends and may lead to fewer breaks between academic periods. There's also a concern about the student culture being too preprofessional and career-focused, with less emphasis on having fun, and the social scene not being as vibrant as Yale's.\n\nFinally, let's consider Yale. The university offers a strong black community and excellent support for FGLI students, which are important factors for you. Additionally, the residential college system and campus aesthetics align with your interests, and the social scene is highly regarded. However, Yale's neuroscience, CS, and biology programs are not as strong as Harvard's or Stanford's, and it's not located near a career hub that you're interested in.\n\nOverall, all three universities have their strengths and weaknesses, and it's up to you to prioritize your needs and wants. Harvard offers a robust research environment and is near biotech and neuroscience hubs, but may have a less vibrant social scene. Stanford offers a variety of majors, a higher FGLI population, and black affinity housing, but may have a preprofessional culture and a less lively social scene. Yale offers a strong black community, excellent support for FGLI students, and a beautiful campus and residential college system, but its programs may not be as strong, and it's not near a career hub you're interested in. Take your time to weigh the pros and cons of each school and consider which one aligns best with your values and goals.\n\nGood luck with your decision!\"\n\nIf you want to chat with a live human, ask me. Harvard has pretty good food. So has Stanford and Yale too, AFAIK. That is not a real problem at all. \"How much money will you have to spend on food\"\" is the real question. There are always going to be restaurants around too. Food should be literally the last of your worries. You should be able to figure out how to get good food at any of these places within three weeks or I will be so disappointed with you, lol.\n\nHave you been to each campus? Try and watch Youtube videos of each campus, at least. The more the number of happy students you see, the more likely you will be happy too. If you are happy, then most likely, you will be productive and successful.\n\nTo me, it seems like you cannot go wrong with any of these choices - althugh it will be helpful for me to understand what sort of vibe you like the most.",

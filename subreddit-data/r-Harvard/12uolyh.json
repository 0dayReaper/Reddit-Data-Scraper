    "postText": "hi everyone,\ni\u2019m an incoming freshman (\u201827) who\u2019s been accepted to both williams and harvard. i\u2019m leaning heavily towards harvard and will probably end up committing, but i\u2019m worried about my finances as an fgli student.\n\nit\u2019s not that my package from harvard is terrible, but williams gave an extra $8k per year in stipends on top of a full ride (no work loans). i would still have to pay 3.5k in student work loan at harvard, and i\u2019m predicting another 5-6k for out of pocket costs for the year (laptops, supplies, etc). i know this is probably one of harvard\u2019s most generous fin aid packages, but i can\u2019t seem to forget williams generous offer. i visited this week and absolutely loved the people and the campus as well.\n\nharvard is the \u201cobvious choice\u201d, but for my family $8-10k is still a lot for a year, and i want to be able to spend college without worrying about money. i am currently working two jobs to save for college, but i feel conflicted knowing that i don\u2019t have to if i choose williams. is there any chance that i might be able to get a better deal if i appeal (anyone who has and gotten more money?). i know it\u2019s a long shot since this is literally harvard\u2019s most generous package.",

            "comment": "I thought about this thread overnight and came back to offer another perspective that might be more useful than my curt initial response. \n\nTo the OP: your education is the biggest investment you\u2019ll ever make. While the money seems huge now, the cost difference between Williams and Harvard will be a rounding error in your total cost of getting an education. \n\nYou should certainly call and see if you can increase your grants. But I don\u2019t think your post is really about money. I think you\u2019re having the typical jitters over whether you \u201cbelong\u201d at Harvard and your anxiety is coming out in the form of worrying about finances. \n\nWilliams is a great school, but Harvard is Harvard. No one thinks they belong at Harvard when they first arrive, even legacies who were raised to be familiar with the school. You belong at Harvard. In a year you\u2019ll look back and smile at how anxious and nervous you were and how you realize what you were worried about as a pre-frosh turned out to be nothing at all. The money will work out for you and you\u2019ll find your place at Harvard. And you\u2019ll be glad you took the leap of faith and went to a college in Boston (no, not Tufts).",

I've visited Williams maybe 5-6 times now and know it really well. If you don't have a car getting food or groceries is almost impossible since delivery services are scarce. It's a super isolated place. To get to Williams you'll have to fly into Albany and leave from Albany unless you want the 3 hour bus ride into Boston. Having said that, they THROW money at you. During COVID my friend got aid refunds. They actually gave them a fridge filled with food, and that they'd regularly stock during the semester, to help during the pandemic. So many more funded opportunities with less competition. I'm not at all surprised that they're being this generous. But as someone on full financial aid, I'd still pick Harvard. The location, campus, even weather (winter is harsher), student body, beats Williams. Also if you have any questions let me know. There are some huge differences in the resources and support between the schools",

I am pretty sure the student work contribution is just referring to the opportunity for you to get a job (like part term during the semester or over the summer) to help you earn  spending money for your day to day expenses not covered by room and board. That would be like clothes, supplies for classes. \n\nI asked the financial aid office if they can add in health insurance and they did no problem for all 4 years. You should also ask to see if they\u2019ll give you dental coverage! If I remember correctly, Harvard also sent me a couple grants probably totaling to $2k (i.e. direct deposited money to my account) in my first year to help me buy things like a laptop, school supplies, coat. You should ask the financial aid office about that. I think they might even help you with the cost of travel between home and campus on breaks if you ask.\n\nMost every event or club on campus that requires money has a financial aid option that is free. It\u2019s a pretty good system. This sort of stuff is not stigmatized on campus and I felt very comfortable thankfully.\n\nWilliams made it very simple by giving the flat yearly stipend, but I\u2019m pretty sure Harvard\u2019s financial aid office matches that, but they do it on an itemized basis. Definitely ask them about the expenses I mentioned!",

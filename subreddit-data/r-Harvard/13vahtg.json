            "comment": "Thanks for your interest in Stat 210! The course is similar in spirit to Stat 110 but at a much higher mathematical level since it is a PhD level course and part of the core theory sequence (Stat 210 through 213) required for first year Stat PhD students.\n\nThere is some overlap of topics, but where in Stat 210 we can go deeper. For example, in Stat 110 we discuss the law of large numbers and central limit theorem for i.i.d. random variables, while in Stat 210 we show that the LLN and CLT hold far beyond the i.i.d. case, and we are also able to delve into the proofs much more. There are also various topics covered in 110 but not 210, and vice versa, e.g., we introduce Markov chains in 110 and martingales in 210. \n\nFor Stat 210, real analysis is highly recommended but not required. There is a lot of analysis-style math in 210, but also a lot that is more purely probabilistic thinking, in a way that different in flavor from analysis. I try to make the proofs self-contained (and in particular introduce the needed measure theory from scratch). But it's certainly harder to understand such proofs without having prior familiarity with real analysis. Many students have done well in Stat 210 without having studied real analysis, but they almost surely (no pun intended -- and in analysis people say \"almost everywhere\" rather than \"almost surely\") found the course substantially more challenging and more time-consuming than they would have with some real analysis background.",

You can take 114 concurrently with stat 210 ( that\u2019s what my friend did and he said 114 helped A LOT with 210). Ofc, to take 114 you should have a working knowledge of real analysis (or at least a chunk of it), but if you took 22ab you\u2019ll be fine too.\n\nedit: clarification",

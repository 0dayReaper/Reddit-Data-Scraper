That\u2019s more of not completely understanding the material in the class. 21b teaches matrices from the ground up. \n\nI came in with 45 min of matrix experience (when my Calc teacher showed us them on the last day of class) and I was fine.",

Toward the end of the class you start the differential equations section, which is very heavy with the 1b content as you cover Fourier Series and the Heat and Wave Equation. Taking 1b will make the differential equations section easier, but as long as you have a good enough grasp of Calc 2/BC content, you should be fine.",

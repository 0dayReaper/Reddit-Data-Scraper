I wanna know if the schedule is doable, I\u2019m considering switching from math 21B to am 22a to reduce course load but I\u2019d like to know if this class is better to take than 21B?",

I heard that 120 seems to be more practical and 121 teaches you theoretical science that's not really practical for the industry. 121 seems to be more for those interested in academic CS, but I'm not really interested in that. Also the Qratings for 120 are much better than 121.",

The assignments were a but miscalibrated and the content slightly disorganized (no central textbook, etc) and overall 121 is more of an old reliable type of thing.",

I got lucky that it was in my pass fail semester. Let me know what else i could clarify.",

I think they\u2019re going to do 1 pset per week starting next fall.\n\nIt\u2019s just a standard math course.\n\nThat said, I think 22a is better because it covers proofs which you\u2019ll do in your theory-based CS classes.",

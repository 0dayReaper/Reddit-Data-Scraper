I didn't know who else to ask, but I'm currently embarking on a voluntary medical leave from the college\u2014want to know if there's a way to still access research/archival resources like HOLLIS as a non-active student, who still wants to be able to freely read and research on their time off?",

I've heard both that it's only granted for those who need it for thesis research etc and that you just have to ask and they'll grant it regardless if you need it. I personally got mine deactivated and when I emailed my dean they said no bc I didn't need it and didn't ask before leaving.",

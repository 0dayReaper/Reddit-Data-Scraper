Would it be better to take it in the spring?\n\n3.) Would you say math 21b is harder than 21a? Is a calc 2 foundation all you need to do well in 21b?\n\n4.) Club recommendations for someone concentrating in CS?",

Most people say 21b is harder, but in terms of Calc foundation, you don\u2019t really need much other than knowing how to solve basic integrals.\n\n4. T4SG, Datamatch, HODP",

Math 21A and Math 21B are offered every semester. I don\u2019t think it would better to take it in the spring and keep in mind to concentrate in CS you don\u2019t need Math 21A.\n3. I don\u2019t think 21b is harder than 21A, and is not really that hard in general. I would suggest even taking 22A since it\u2019s teaches you proofs, which will be helpful for CS courses. \n\n4. There\u2019s quite a few clubs. Some are Tech for Social Good, Datamatch, Harvard Undergraduate Data Analytics Group, and Harvard Open Data Project.",

You barely need Calc for 21b, it\u2019s just good to understand differential equations and have some knowledge of series and you\u2019ll be fine.",

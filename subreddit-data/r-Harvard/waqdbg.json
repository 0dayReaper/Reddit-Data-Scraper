Good rooms. No tourists trying to peak inside. The central spiral staircase means you can get to meet people more easily, which is a plus",

            "comment": "My freshman year there was a mysterious rash that broke out in Pennypacker. Rumor was that it was scabies. The college actually had the other proctors talk to all of us about how it definitely wasn\u2019t scabies, and it was ok to hang out with friends from Pennypacker. One of my good friends (to this day) was in Pennypacker and we still occasionally call him \u201cScabies [first name].\u201d",

            "comment": "I was in pennypacker this last year! I honestly loved it! The guaranteed in-suite bathroom is so nice! Common rooms are huge (we had enough room for a bean bag chair, two desks, a full futon that folded out into a bed, and a coffee table), some dorms even have an extra little foyer space where we just had extra storage. In my setup, we had one smaller room and one bigger room. Both rooms had enough space to debunk and hold dressers, but the smaller room didn\u2019t have enough space for the desks too (hence the 2 in the common room). Overall, it\u2019s a really nice dorm, close to the first year office, close to Lamont, and it really isn\u2019t that far of a walk from annenberg, if anything the stroll is nice. You really don\u2019t feel that disconnected from the freshman/yard life, you\u2019ll have friends there anyways to hang out with. The only downside I saw was having to wake up a bit earlier to make it to my classes at the Northwest building which was a good 15 minute walk away. Plus all of the proctors in pennypacker (assuming they stay the same) are amazing and pretty chill! I was pretty bummed out about getting pennypacker but really learned to love it after only a couple of weeks!",

            "comment": "From [Globe.com](https://Globe.com):\n\nCONCORD, N.H. \u2014 Denise Lodge, 63, covered her face with a printout of the indictment against her Wednesday afternoon as she walked silently from the federal courthouse following her arrest on charges related to an alleged scheme to steal and sell donated body parts.  \n\n\n  \nHer husband, Cedric Lodge, 55, the morgue manager at Harvard Medical School, had allegedly taken human remains from his workplace without permission and engaged in an interstate conspiracy to profit off of them.  \n\n\n  \n\u201cWe are appalled to learn that something so disturbing could happen on our campus \u2014 a community dedicated to healing and serving others,\u201d George Q. DaleyDean, of the Faculty of Medicine at Harvard University, and Edward M. Hundert, Dean for Medical Education at Harvard Medical School, said in an e-mail statement.  \n\n\n  \n\u201cThe reported incidents are a betrayal of HMS and, most importantly, each of the individuals who altruistically chose to will their bodies to HMS through the Anatomical Gift Program to advance medical education and research.\u201d  \n\n\n  \nCedric Lodge was terminated from his job at Harvard on May 6, according to the university.  \n\n\n  \nA federal grand jury indictment returned Tuesday in Pennsylvania alleges that the couple, who live in Goffstown, N.H., conspired with others as part of a yearslong nationwide network that illegally bought and sold organs and cadaver pieces pilfered from Harvard Medical School and a mortuary in Arkansas.",

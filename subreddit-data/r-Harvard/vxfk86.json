    "postText": "How much spanish do i need to relearn to test out using the placement test? What is the difficulty level and does the proctored speaking portion happen right after you take the online exam or once you get on campus. I took SL Spanish all throughout high school but it\u2019s been a year since then and i wanna know my chances of testing out and how much I should relearn.",

            "comment": "I don't have advice for the studying or difficulty level since I am native speaker, and I took the test last year and both parts were online so idk how helpful this will be. The proctored test was just a zoom where we did the basically the same test and the proctor just made sure you kept your eyes on your screen; I guess it'll be different for you.\n\nAs for the test content, one part is literally a bunch of sentences with a word missing and you choose the right one from a dropdown box which has a lot of words. The other part is listening to a narrator speak about something and then you pick out the correct response. The last part is reading a passage and then choosing the correct response. Hope this helps.",

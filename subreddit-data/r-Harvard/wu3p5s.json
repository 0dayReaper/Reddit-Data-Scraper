    "postText": "I'm figuring out whether I'm going to take CS 120 or CS 121 in the fall, and I have skimmed over Pset 0. After taking CS20, most of the problems (if not all the problems) on Pset 0 don't look that bad, and I am pretty sure that I could solve all of them.\n\nI have looked at the Q guide, and some comments say CS20 does not provide enough mathematical preparedness to take the course, but it appears that Problem Set 0 can be done pretty comfortably with just CS20 knowledge.\n\nDo you really need much more significant proof experience (than CS20) to do well in the class or does Pset 0 not really accurately gauge mathematical preparation?",

Most people I took the course with had no proof-based experience at all. \n\nIf you can do Pset 0, you\u2019re definitely ready to take the course. \n\nAs an aside I was way over prepared after taking CS124 and CS152 before 121. That was a bad decision, because 124 demolished me. CS121 is good preparation for the harder proof-based CS courses",

            "comment": "You've asked this same question multiple times. \n\nCS120 is preferred over CS121 because 121 intersects more with the mathematical/theory side of Computer Science while CS120, though still a theory course, is deemed more practical because of its focus on algorithms. Also, CS120 is generally easier. \n\nIf you're more interested in academic CS, then take 121. If not then take 120.",

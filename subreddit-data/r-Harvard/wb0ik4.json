            "comment": "Straus is right next to the street so it can be a bit loud at night. But it\u2019s also basically at the square so really nice location. Walk to Annenberg is a bit far but not too bad. It has an in-suite bathroom so that was very convenient. The common room is really big and it has really high ceilings. However, the rooms are really tiny. I had the room to myself bc my freshman year everyone got their own room and I still felt it was tiny for one person. So be ready to get very close with your roommate.  Also the basement seems like it\u2019s haunted, very creepy. Also it doesn\u2019t have its own laundry room so you have to go to the building in the front. It\u2019s like right in front so it\u2019s not too bad but can be a bit inconvenient in the winter. The basement of the building in the front is also really nice and I used to do work there a fair bit. Overall, it\u2019s not the best and it\u2019s not the worst",

You'll get to know your roommates and people in your entry-way super well.  Felt like a family/community.\n\nNever noticed the street noise.  You can always use headphones anyway.  Laundry was a walk but never bothered me for some reason.",

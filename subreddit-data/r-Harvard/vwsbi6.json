Easier to get an A than PS2/3, but the physics itself isn\u2019t \u201ceasy physics\u201d if that makes sense. It\u2019s also a lot of work, hard if you want to be correct but easy if you\u2019re just going for the A, and that is definitely a draw back. No lecture, you learn from reading the textbook which is an assignment on its own.",

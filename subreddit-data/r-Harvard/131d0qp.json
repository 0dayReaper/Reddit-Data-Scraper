    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nAs an incoming freshman deciding between the Stats and Math major, I'd love to try out classes to decide which one fits me the best. Unfortunately, these 2 first-year courses (STAT 110 and MATH 25) only take place in the Fall. I want to fill the other 2 classes on my schedule with (very) easy, non-psets, courses. I'd appreciate your input on whether STAT 110 and MATH 25 are even feasible. If they are, could you let me know which 2 other classes should I take to make sure I won't die? If they are not, what should I do to know if math or stats is right for me? I really want to do a proof class in the Fall. \n\nRegarding talking with my academic advisors, I'm afraid they can be misleading because they told a freshman that STAT 110, MATH 55 (:skull:), HUM 10, and Freshman Seminar *balanced.*\n\nMy math background:  \nAIME Qualification (not USAMO)  \nClasses taken: Calc 3 (Multi and Vector), Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations (non-proof based)  \n\n\nAny input is appreciated.",

            "comment": "Welcome to Harvard, and I'm glad you're interested in Stat! I teach Stat 110 so can hardly not recommend it. You can consider joint or double Stat/Math concentrations, or concentrate in one and secondary field in the other. For all of these as well as various other possible STEM concentrations, taking Math 25a and Stat 110 will give you a lot of foundational material that should be well worth the effort required.\n\nEven if 25a or 110 were offered in the spring, it would be helpful taking both in the fall as preparation for various possible spring courses that depend on them. Taking both sounds completely feasible with your background (but I agree it's a good idea to balance these out with a couple easier courses).",

If you do end up finding it too hard for your first semester then it's also completely fine to take Stat 110 sophomore year (which is the most common time to take it). But based on your math background and interests that you described, I think you should be able to handle it in your first year.\n\nAbout summer preparation for math, it's not necessary, but could be useful (and fun, considering that you have mathlover in your name). There is a free book about proof [here](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/Main.pdf) but I especially like [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Proofs-Long-Form-Mathematics-Textbook-Math/dp/B08T8JCVF1) by Jay Cummings (currently $16 on Amazon).",

I\u2019m an incoming freshman at Harvard planning on a joint concentration in sociology and statistics. Both fields are obviously extremely strong at the school so I\u2019m super excited for the next four years! In my preliminary thinking about freshman year math, I\u2019m currently deciding between the 21 and 22 sequences\u2014I have taken Calculus 1-3 (though I\u2019m admittedly a year removed from them now) and am currently dabbling in linear algebra and discrete math as a senior, but have no competition or extracurricular math experience. Do you think that 21 or 22 would set me up better for the stats curriculum or are they similar enough? I don\u2019t have any experience with proofs outside of introductory discrete math stuff and admittedly don\u2019t want to get lost in my first semester with with 22\u2019s proofier methods. Also, any tips for doing a joint concentration with stats? Are there any professors or programs you think someone interested in the more computational/statistical social sciences should check out?",

We've had some amazing joint Soc/Stat concentrators over the years (feel free to email me and I will put you in touch with a couple of them, and they would probably be happy to share their experiences and advice with you some time). \n\nI think 21 or 22 are both fine, but learning a deeper level of mathematical thinking from 22 could be very helpful for some future courses that require some theoretical and mathematical thinking. It will be harder but that initial investment could pay off later, as long as you don't let yourself get overwhelmed. However, it also depends very much on who is teaching a course in a particular semester! That can affect not only the difficulty level but also the style, emphasis, and overall experience in a course. Dusty Grundmeier, who was beloved for his teaching of Math 22, is unfortunately leaving: [https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/4/13/dusty-grundmeier-farewell/](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/4/13/dusty-grundmeier-farewell/)  \nI don't know who is teaching 21 or 22 next year, so it would also be good to know more about that. Although shopping period is, sadly, going away, it should hopefully still be possible to try out both for a week or two and then settle on one. \n\nAbout computational social science, check out [IQSS](https://www.iq.harvard.edu) and all the faculty affiliated with it. There are various Stat faculty with strong interests in the social sciences, and Gov, Soc, Econ, and Psych faculty with strong interests in statistics. Try attending office hours, talks, and whatever events you can find where you can get to know various faculty and students with interests related to yours. \n\nFor joint concentrations in general, think about whether a joint or a double would be more suitable (joint has fewer restrictions on double-counting, but requires a senior thesis combining the two fields). If things get too busy later or you feel there are too many requirements, you can drop down to a concentration in one and secondary field in the other.",

You really don't need much content-wise to do Math 25--just some mathematical maturity, which your background suggests you have. From what I have heard, Math 55 is not quite as demanding as it once was, so the academic advisor's advice may not be ill-informed.",

HOWEVER Harvard does not withhold taxes from the stipend disbursement, so I have to add additional withholdings to my W-2 and Massachusetts withholding statement to not owe money when I file taxes, which only works because I hold other hourly jobs on campus that do withhold taxes. It is complicated but it is taxed as if it is regular income from work, subject to the regular tax schedule.",

As a first year (sciences - we\u2019re paid as a stipend for the first 2 years) I had no other jobs except my stipend and I put away about 20% a month to cover the impending bill and I overshot it a bit. Once you get a ballpark for how much your tax burden will be this year (filing year 2022) you can start paying estimated taxes as well (for 2023 onward) to alleviate the burden at the time of filing.",

So you can guess what we chose. I\u2019m not saying I won\u2019t get audited, but that was back in 2016. With how expensive it is for the IRS to audit someone I doubt a graduate student is their primary target. I later had a NASA space grant (also in grad school) that came with a stipend increase and that was heavily taxed (automatically by the university) This was in CT, I know each state has their own state tax rules etc. anyways, not a tax expert, this is not tax advice and I can\u2019t think of anything more boring than messaging about my grad school taxes. Im in MA now getting my ass handed to with taxes ~20% of my income.\n\nEdit- TLDR IRS will always win in the end",

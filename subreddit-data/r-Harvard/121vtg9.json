    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m an incoming undergraduate researcher here for the summer (not any of the REUs), and I\u2019m from the West Coast. I wondered if there were any resources (clubs?) for finding friends and adjusting to this new atmosphere since I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s like in the summer (or Harvard in general) (i.e., are there still students around?). I know there\u2019s discord, but I sadly don\u2019t have a Harvard edu address and probably won\u2019t get it until June, so not sure if there are other platforms where I could meet other undergraduates/people in the Boston area. Also, I'm not 21, so I can\u2019t head down to the bars.",

You'll also be living around the other undergraduate researchers (assuming that your housing is provided by the college) and I honestly met great people just befriending those in my hallway. I'm personally going to be on campus researching this summer too, so feel free to shoot me any specific questions :)",

I will be living off campus (though within walking distance of Harvard square), and I tried looking at my department\u2019s page for events, but I couldn\u2019t find anything for the summer. I\u2019m aware of the summer school here, but I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019d be eligible for any of their extracurriculars since I\u2019m not part of any programs here. Would you know of any other departments/areas I could look into for finding events?",

    "postText": "Hello everybody! I am an incoming second year at the college and have recently beem grappling with some course related stress. \n\nI am a potential cs and stat or physics double concentrator(will be decided this semester based on how I like my courses). My original plan for this semester was math 101(discrete math req), stat 110(probability req), ec 1010a(stat rec), and a gened, however, I recently saw cs 124 is a an essential sophomore spring course and thay it really helps to take 120 before. My new schedule would be math 101, stat 110, ec 1010a, and cs 120.\n\n I am a bit worried about taking cs 120, however, because I have no proof experience and just got done taking 21b and also have only taken cs 50. \n\nI would appreciate if anyone could give me advice on my schedule and whether it is doable given my current background. If it turns out to be doable, what is some essential preparation I may need to do this summer to make sure I dont do poorly in 120? I appreciateany feedback given and thank you in advance! :)",

Taking CS120 before has a marginal benefit on how you'll do in CS124.\n\n&gt;I am a bit worried about taking cs 120, however, because I have no proof of experience and just got done taking 21b and also have only taken cs 50.\n\nYea, you need to know how to write proofs to take 124 and write proofs well. This is an area where CS120 will be particularly beneficial for you in getting practice on this front. However, I will say you're in a bit of trouble if you don't have proof writing experience before 120. Before you take the class or during the first week of the fall semester, you'll want to gain a good understanding of induction, proving bi-directionals, proofs of contradictions, and the overall approach to writing proofs before taking the class.\n\nYour course plan is a tough schedule. I took CS120, STAT 110, and EC1010A in the fall semester, and it was a bit difficult from a workload perspective. You're trying to take 4 pset classes, which seems like a bit much. I am not too familiar with the Physics concentration reqs, but do you need to take Math 101? If not, you might want to forego taking the class because it's a soft requirement for CS.\n\nFeel free to reply or PM directly with questions. I can speak specifically on CS120, STAT 110, and ECON 1010A as I took that course schedule last fall, and I'll also be TFing 120.",

Thank you so much for replyingz really appreciate it!\n\nIn terms of where I heard it, when looking at the cs120 qguide it seems common for people to mention they can see how cs 120 would help for 124 and say it would help people be eased into it. \n\nHaha yes I know me not having proof experience is a big worry of mine. On one hand if I just dont take cs 120, I was planning on 101 being my primary proof experience before 124 but on the other I dont know if that is enough? If I do decide to take 120 I will definitely self study proofs the majority of the summer so as to not be that behind. Are there any resources/ more topics you recommend reviewing?\n\nYea the schedule is looking very rough and I am planning on dropping one course most likely which will be probably math 101, cs 120, or math 101 depending on what I decide. Math 101 is apart of some reqs (related courses req) for stat if I decide to concentrate in it and would also be a physics req(same related courses req) if i stick with that. What does soft requirement mean by the way? \n\nAs for ec 1010a, I can always take it any semester to fulfill the req but yk just nice to get it out of the way and it doesnt seem to be as much work as the others. What was your experience in ec and how it played into your other courses? Was the workload more than the you expected?\n\nAlso how did you find that course plan when you took it? Did alot of the exams overlap and make life stressful or was it fairly spread out and just took some time management?\n\nLastly,  would you suggest not tsking 120 this semester and just focusing on 101 and stat 110 to prepare for 124 next semester? I know you may not have an answer but just interested to see what your plan of action would be as someone who has taken a similar schedule haha.\n\nSorry for all the questions haha just very stressed rn!.",

                            "comment": "I\u2019m not too familiar with 101 but given it covers discrete math and is a proof based class, it should be enough. \n\nEC1010A is definitely not bad as a stand-alone course. The only issue is when you take 1010A with two or more pset heavy classes. 1010A isn\u2019t difficult per se, but it does require some amount of work.\n\nHonestly you really want to take 120, taking 110 and 101 should be fine. Ultimately, you can enroll in all these classes the first week, see how it goes, and then drop. \n\nMy issue with 1010A is that there were points in the semester when I was so focused on 120 and 110 that I didn\u2019t put enough attention in 1010A, which resulted in me literally studying less than 24 hours for the midterm, for instance. Ultimately, I was still able to do relatively well on the exams since I didn\u2019t find the course particularly challenging, but there was definitely a lack of focus on my part when taking it.\n\nIn terms of how I found the course plan, taking 61 and/or 120 + Stat 110 is fairly standard for a CS sophomore. I took EC1010A because I\u2019m still considering an EC secondary.",

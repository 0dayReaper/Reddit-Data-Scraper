It sounds like they were just tired of devoting IT staff time toward resolving issues with this feature, and rather than tackling this issue with some simple training (like the 10 min EHS training required for campus access during Covid)  they just cut it cold turkey...really lame to do this, it's really a final 'fuck you' to grads of this Covid era (and obviously beyond)",

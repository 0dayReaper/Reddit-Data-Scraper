I can understand being interested in hearing from a student about their experiences, if they found the bureaucracy difficult, if staff and faculty were generally helpful, etc.\n\nKeep in mind that accommodations at Harvard, and in higher ed in general, are overall different than in K-12; in higher ed there's much more of an expectation to work independently and to express what you need.\n\nNote: DAO only serves students in the College, GSAS, and SEAS. Other Harvard Schools have their own [student disability coordinators](https://accessibility.harvard.edu/student-coordinators).",

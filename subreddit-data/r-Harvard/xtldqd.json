When I was sick, I called the clinic and they had me come in that same morning, I saw someone right away, and was sent to their facility in the basement of Smith Center for x-rays which I only had to wait 30 minutes for. I've been very happy with the quality of service - Google reviews from students are definitely going to suffer from selection bias.",

Since I was a new patient, the doctor and I had a long talk about my history, needs, meds, etc. Probably the most time I've spent with a doc in years. She was knowledgeable, listened, and didn't seem in a hurry to fob me off, which is rare these days. \n\nAlso in the waiting room, I noticed an older couple talking with a nurse who'd gotten a same day appointment due to illness. I'm happy to wait for a routine physical if that means folks can get in right away when they're really sick or hurt. \n\nMy partner has also had good experiences.",

My PCP is very responsive in the patient portal which means that I get answers to my questions quickly without having to play phone tag or make an unnecessary appointment. I appreciate having access to urgent care within the system and not having to figure out what urgent care to go to that will take my insurance.",

            "comment": "Bad reviews are common for any kind of clinic because people usually don't bother writing about their successful experiences but never forget to write a bad review if something went wrong. I've been to the clinic many times (I have a chronic condition), plus I've been to urgent care a couple of times. Urgent care was terrific because they gave me an appointment right away. The only issue is that sometimes you need to wait for some appointments for months, but this is usually for something not urgent like a dermatologist or an ophthalmologist appointment. Overall I'm very happy with them!",

P.T. and optometry have been good experiences too. \n\nI waited 3 months to see a dermatologist. They were 50 minutes late then my appointment was only 20 minutes , so I had to wait again for another appointment to discuss all my issues. \n\nThe mental health services are bottom of the barrel and only exist to serve student mental health crises, not any kind of extended therapy. There's a therapy shortage in the area and I spent months trying to find a therapist. During that time, CAMHS basically refused to see me and I had to fight them to give me some kind of care while I looked for a permanent therapist. \n\nA really big issue is that Harvard student insurance requires you to do everything through HUHS. If you need anything short of ER care, you have to be close to campus to use it. And if you need to see an outside specialist, as you are prone to do if you have serious health conditions, the insurance limits you to 12 total outside specialist visits (that is not per specialist but total).",

I'm in recovery from an eating disorder and i needed my vitals taken and a blind weight done (i'm not supposed to know my weight). they decided they needed a urine sample(??) and they needed me to undress and get in a LITERAL HOSPITAL GOWN to take said urine sample(????). the nurse was nice to me, but she didn't explain why she needed what she needed, and i felt kind of violated by being asked to undress like that. it was honestly giving inpatient.   \n\n\nthen she weighed me in the hospital gown and told me my weight exactly like she wasn't supposed to. it retriggered my ED and now i'm struggling to eat regular meals. i'm supposed to go back for some blood work, but i really don't want to. i'm kind of scared at this point.\n\nanyway if you have a cough they might tell you you have an upper respiratory infection :)",

It\u2019s not like restaurants where people are excited to talk about service and maybe even go there with the plan of review. Medical service providers are disproportionately likely to get very negative reviews since it\u2019s often only when service is very bad that it occurs to people to leave a review in the first place.",

Having a good PCP is key as they're your gateway to other specialists.\n\nThe only bad experience I've had was a demeaning nurse practitioner when I was at the urgent care.

I'm an admitted class of 27 student who will be attending Visitas on April 23-24.\n\nI will also be in the Cambridge area for the following two days, Tuesday and Wednesday, and would prefer to room on Harvard campus. Does anyone have a room in their dorm that I could use for those two days? I would be happy to pay a reasonable price to do this.\n\nPlease DM me if you think this is possible. Thanks!",

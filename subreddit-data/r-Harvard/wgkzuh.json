            "comment": "Two factors to consider: Harvard is private property, so you'd want to check with HUPD first. Secondly, depending upon whether you'll be earning money from the video (including just ads on YouTube) you would need a license from the FAA (since it would be considered a commercial operation under federal law) and you'd need to comply with the relevant regulations like prohibitions on flying over people or vehicles. Most drones have a module built into them these days that acts as a transponder, similar to what you'd see on any other aircraft. This is for safety within the shared airspace, but also allows the government to prosecute if anything goes wrong and someone/something is injured/damaged.

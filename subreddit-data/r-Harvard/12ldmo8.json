    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nUsing a throwaway account. I recently got into a master\u2019s program at Harvard GSE with a decent scholarship, and I have had straight A's for a while, but I am in one class this semester that I am struggling in and I might finish with a C, so is it likely that my scholarship could be rescinded for getting one lower grade? I know I will pass the class, but am not sure if I'll end up with a B or C quite yet. \n\nAlso, it is a class in my field of study (though not a required one, just an elective) and my GPA in my major is a 3.9 but might drop a little if I end up with a C.",

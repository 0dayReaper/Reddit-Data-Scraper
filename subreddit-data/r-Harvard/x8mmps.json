This may be a silly question, but I was in the Widener large reading room today (the one with long wooden tables that have lamps built into them) and couldn\u2019t figure out how to turn on the lamp. It\u2019s probably obvious, but I looked all over and couldn\u2019t find a switch or anything. Can someone enlighten me?",

You pull out your wand, point at the lamp, and yell \u201cLumos!\u201d You have yell it really loud otherwise people will just think you\u2019re weird.\n\n\u2026What this spell does is get the attention of the nearest person who will take pity on you and tell you the secret. \n\nEdit: \u201cIt\u2019s LOO-mohs, not Loo-MOHS.\u201d",

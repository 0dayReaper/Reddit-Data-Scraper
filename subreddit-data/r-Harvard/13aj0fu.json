    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m an incoming Harvard Law student and am considering HUH options. I got a pretty decent window (I think) so I\u2019m trying to make a list of priority units. I know they go fast, so I want to be ready with the units I want most. I\u2019ve heard apartment buildings are better than houses converted into apartments, so I\u2019m considering Terry Terrace, 29 Garden Street, 85-95 Prescott and Kirkland Court. I\u2019m open to Haskins but it looks like it might be far. Are these units more or less equal in quality or would you recommend any one over the other?\n\nFor context: I\u2019m looking for a studio ideally or alternatively, a 1bed/1bath. I\u2019m happy to walk 10-15 minutes for class, I went to college in Vermont. I\u2019m also not partial towards central A/C or parking. Mainly, I\u2019m wondering which buildings have the best rooms in terms of layout / sunlight / surrounding location and overall, which will have the coziest room to cry in when the workload gets too much lol.\n\nIf anyone has lived in or visited rooms in the above places, any insight would be welcome! Thank you :)",

            "comment": "They're all pretty good.  I think walking distance is key - you'll want time to decompress from school to home (imho).  29 garden you have to cross mass ave which means walking to a crosswalk/waiting for signals, not a big deal at all but not a mindless walk home like towards kirkland court.  Flip side is you're closer to bus connections up into davis and out towards watertown--good restaurants and sofra access.  Kirkland Court and Prescott are close to whole foods and inman square. \n\nDark horse i'd recommend would be a garden level unit in Peabody Terrace - super quiet, huge windows out on a shade dappled courtyard with towering oaks.  Close to b school activities and more b school people if you're into that sort of thing.",

I think I'll likely spend most of my time at the law school, otherwise Peabody Terrace seemed like a great option. I'm also adding 472 Broadway to the list, since it seems about as close as Prescott. Any thoughts on whether I should be open to the townhouse apartments, like the ones on Sumner St and Mellen St? Thank you again!",

Do you know by any chance why this is the case and whether there is also a possibility to stay longer (because I am planning to stay in Boston until 8/31/2024)",

My window just started, too and I\u2019m already disappointed by the rather small number of units in each of the places I\u2019m interested in.\n\nThe [HUH Q&amp;A](https://files.constantcontact.com/13030f81601/eb946660-ebdb-40e4-bd8a-03d8eeb34d46.pdf) states that all leases end 6/30/2024, but you will have the option (next March) during the Housing Election Period to get a short term lease renewal until 7/31/2024 or a long term lease renewal until 6/30/2025. You can even opt for the long term lease renewal and then terminate your lease early by 8/30/2024- this is doable if you pay the early termination charge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: added a link to the Q&amp;A, it's a really helpful document! Good luck with your search!",

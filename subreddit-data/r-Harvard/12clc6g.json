I will be attending both the SROH program and the Classics Scholars-In-Training program (I'll be in the ancient Greek course) this summer, and was wondering what to expect, and if anyone has any advice for either? As well, I am coming from the south, so any tips with regards to life/summer in the north would also be appreciated :)\n\nThanks in advance!",

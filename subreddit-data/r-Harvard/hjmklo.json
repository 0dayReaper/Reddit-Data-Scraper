Good question, but the better question is why do people post things on Tik Tok that are edgy? \n\nI rant a lot, but not on a platform with my photo attached to it. \n\nI know of a university rescind the enrollment for a 17-year-old undergraduate for something said student wrote when she was 14. The mob demanded action, and the school decided admitting her was a poor business decision.  \n\nWe can debate the merits of the decisions of this school and Deloitte, but it misses the point. Companies and schools are going to err on the side of caution. People posting on social media should do the same when it can easily be tied to your real life person.",

I'd imagine that a Chinese company would have an even bigger problem with this than a company run by Republicans.\n\nIf a client hires Deloitte, and she sees that the client doesn't have many black employees, is she going to go on TikTok and blast them? Deloitte isn't taking that chance. Representing herself poorly in public doesn't give Deloitte the confidence that she can represent them or their clients.",

It is included bc she is a bloody fool that is an idiot irl but at work/school, she can add big numbers to make bigger numbers.  It is a warning for many who think they are too smart to get themselves into trouble. Harvard is involved in this like it was with the education of 18 presidents and hundreds of senators. Get off your high horse Harvard.",

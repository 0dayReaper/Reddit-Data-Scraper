The College?\n\nIf you\u2019re at the College you should email your Res Dean about this as I think it has to go before Ad Board. Your faculty do NOT have discretion here to decide. So email your Res Dean (or RDF I guess)",

The key takeaway is when it comes to finals they have to follow the larger policy. I think it changed for this year\u2026might not require Ad board anymore. Regardless yeah make sure you connect with RD directly, which sounds like you have done. \n\nFeel better!!!!\n\nMakeups often happen \u201clate\u201d so once you recover start studying and really continue to do so over the break\u2014even just a little every day. Trying to \u201cre study\u201d for a final AFTER break\u2026ugh I tried that once and it SUCKED.",

So, hopefully OP got everything sorted. \n\nIf they are second week in January though my advice still holds: it\u2019s easy to sort of procrastinate and I tend to forget material fairly quickly if I\u2019m not practicing it so my advice would still be to study steadily over the break.",

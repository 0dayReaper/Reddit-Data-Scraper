The show this year is genuinely hilarious and has some great original music to boot.\n\nThe show is running for another couple weeks at Farkas Hall in Harvard Square before heading on tour to New York and Bermuda---- 10/10 would recommend going with a few fun friends!\n\n[hastypudding.org/buy-tickets/](https://www.hastypudding.org/buy-tickets/)",

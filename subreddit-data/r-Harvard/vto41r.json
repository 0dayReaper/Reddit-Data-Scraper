Plus, if you're going into something like consulting or engineering or medicine, a few ten thousand dollars in loans isn't the end of the world. \n\nThat said, OP just needs to explain why the package isn't ideal and see what Harvard says.",

I think people have conflated \u201chaving hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans is bad\u201d with \u201chaving any amount of student loans is bad\u201d and that\u2019s not realistic. \n\nOP, don\u2019t finance a graduate degree from NYU film school but if you get out of undergrad with a reasonable amount of debt at an acceptable interest rate, you will be ok.",

If you're at that level or lower, you're definitely going to college for free and most people with household incomes well below six figures here will be paying little to nothing in tution.\n\nIf you're in that category, where you're not quite broke enough to be paying nothing and not quite rich off enough to be casually off-loading 80K per year, then study something useful and you'll pay all your loans in 10 years after graduation.\n\nIt's time to put on your big boy pants. No one is saying that you should go out there taking 200K in loans to go to Harvard. That said, anything under the six-figure loan mark is manageable if you pursue a career that gives you a guaranteed salary per year larger than your loan amount.",

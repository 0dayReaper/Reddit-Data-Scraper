    "postText": "Hi! I know this is extremely early, but I was just at Visitas checking out stuff this weekend and had some questions that I didn\u2019t get to ask/just thought about. \n\n1. If I have some experience with CS (think AP CSA, AP CSP, CodeForces, some USACO), should I skip CS 50 and take CS61 in the fall (or a different CS course, any recommendations?) \n\n2. This is probably thinking too far ahead, but should I take CS 124 (DS&amp;A) in my first-year spring? I don\u2019t know how many first years take CS124 b/c I know the class is very challenging so idk if 61 would even prepare me for 124. My logic was that I should take 124 early for internships and research and whatnot, but idk if taking it first year spring will be the best idea, but I\u2019m not sure, what do y\u2019all think? \n\nThat\u2019s all I have for now :) thanks!",

            "comment": "61 and 124 are on *completely* separate material, the former will not prepare you for the latter. \n\nThe coding in 124 is not very challenging, so if that\u2019s what you\u2019ve had experience with before, don\u2019t expect it to give you a leg up. 124 is hard because the proof writing and the concepts are difficult to wrap your head around. \n\nUnless you have a *very* solid foundation with writing proofs and thinking about CS algorithms, I would highly recommend you take one or both of CS20/CS120 before jumping into CS124",

If you've never done proofs before have fun playing catch-up 30 hours a week. \n\nOne option to consider is CS 120 in the fall - it's a gentler intro to theoretical CS than 124, and maybe with 22 + 120 you could hack it. And then you could do 124 frosh spring without 20\n\nEdit: Also, don't neglect Stat 110! Biggest regret of college is not taking it freshman year. Amazing class, you understand *nothing* about probability without it (or equivalent), but even if you don't care about that in general (which would be stupid) 124 is heavy on probabilistic algorithms because Mitzenmacher designed the class. You'll struggle a lot in the 2nd half without 110.",

I definitely recommend taking CS 61 first semester, but i would hold back on 124 if you don\u2019t feel very comfortable with proofs (enough to take math 25). CS 50 is fun too (and will be quite more chill compared to 61) but if you wanna get to the more interesting CS electives your sophomore/junior year, every requirement you complete is a win. \n\nFor CS 20, I don\u2019t recommend taking it. If you take math 22ab+, and have discrete math experience, take a different course that\u2019s more interesting. For instance CS 51, 161, 141, etc depending on your background. I definitely recommend stat 110 freshman fall, but that\u2019s up to you.\n\nDon\u2019t be too stressed as you\u2019ll most likely change your mind about classes. I recommend enjoying your summer and thinking about reflecting about what you want to do in the future academically, clubs, and other things. Class choices will be natural when the time comes.",

I\u2019m looking to do a joint in CS &amp; Statistics, but I would like to take a CS course in the fall as well. I think Stat110, Math22A, and Cs61 would be overkill and hell, especially in first year fall.\n\nSEAS strongly recommends you take a linear algebra course first semester of your first year.",

I think it\u2019s not impossible to do 22a, stat110, and cs 61 but if you feel like that\u2019s too much, you can either drop stat 110 or switch to cs 50. Stat 110 is extremely foundational and you will use it in many other courses (any ML course, cs 124/121). CS 61 is really important too, but if you\u2019re not going to do a lot of systems, it doesn\u2019t hurt to take it sophomore year.",

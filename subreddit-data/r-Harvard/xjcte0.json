I've planned a couple days ahead of then to check out the campus and surrounding area. Are there any good food spots or anything else around I should make sure to check out while I'm in town?",

The doors on the sides are sometimes open and you can go in and look at the stained glass from inside, and Sanders Theater.\n\n* Walk along the Charles River, and over the Weeks footbridge. View of campus from the other side of the river is classic.",

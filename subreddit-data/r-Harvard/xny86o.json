    "postText": "Hello! So my dad is a competitive sailer and a sailing instructor. He has collected sailing shirts from all of the schools his children have attended. Most of them just read \"Georgetown Sailing\" or \"Yale Sailing\" maybe with a little graphic of the university logo, but pretty simple. He's very cute and will text us photos of himself wearing the shirt corresponding to our school on big days for us (interviews, presentations, etc) or for the school (e.g. major football games). I am getting married to a woman who attended Harvard and thought it would be fun to get my dad a \"Harvard Sailing\" shirt in honor of his first daughter-in-law so she can join the weird little family tradition! \n\nI have looked very hard to find a Harvard Sailing shirt online but cannot find one. We live in Boston so I took the T down to Harvard Sq and looked around the Coop and the Harvard Shop but didn't see it either. Does anyone know how I can get a Harvard Sailing shirt?",

Not sure that they had a shirt for sailing, but I wasn\u2019t looking too closely. They might be able to help there.",

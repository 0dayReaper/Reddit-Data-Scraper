Although both Harvard and Yale had equally impressive programs that interested me, the amount of times they mentioned the 2004 football prank was out of this world annoying. I remember my mom quoting Mean Girls to me (*why are you so obsessed with me*) and making the Regina vs. Janis comparison, summed it up pretty well.",

Many years later, I went to graduate school at Yale. New Haven had improved, but it was still bleak. I met a number of people who had gone to Yale as undergrads and they adored Yale. Too bad I didn't meet those people during my weekend.",

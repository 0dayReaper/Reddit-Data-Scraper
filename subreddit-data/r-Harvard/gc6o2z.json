Given the silence on u/admeeted's part, I would imagine that most of the other allegations are true as well, unfortunately.",

Obviously what he did is reprehensible, but at the end of the day he is just a dumb kid. He didn\u2019t kill/rape/kidnapped someone, his mistake is purely ethical and moral. Something like that can be fixed by attending a good college, like harvard, and having a couple of ethics courses.",

To make matters worse, the current owner (Nick) has zero experience working with modern media and communications. (The guy doesn't even use a cellphone). \n\nI was hoping to get the word out through this subreddit and help prevent another long-time, independently owned business to disappear from Harvard.  To help, just go and get a haircut.",

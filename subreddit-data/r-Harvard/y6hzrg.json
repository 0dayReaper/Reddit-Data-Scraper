On campus housing applications are March/April, and most landlords don\u2019t even know if tenants are staying on until the end of spring. You\u2019ll have much more luck in the late spring/summer months - up to July even places will pop up for August move-in dates",

A colleague of mine ended up renting a very expensive Airbnb though because he didn't find anything.",

Have we taught you nothing? Get the fuck out of here, next semester will be taught entirely via Club Penguin and guess what, you still have to pay room and board suckers.\n\nor \n\nHaha, forget what Larry said, five days to get the fuck off campus and we will give you a little under 6 hours to petition to stay!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand that Harvard is in a difficult position but over at Harvard Medical School their deans have nightly calls and updates for their students, we have to settle for a one two email punch that gives us basically no useable information. They can't keep throwing emails at us like this, it's reckless, ineffective and cruel. If you are going to fuck us over at least have the decency to do it in some bullshit pre-recorded video--Jesus.",

If people want a better experience they can always transfer to an institution that will provide that experience.

If not, then talk to your dean about taking the semester off until things return to normal.\n\nMaybe I just didn't grow up with an inflated sense of entitlement when things don't go how I planned or expected, so I see things differently.",

I have to wonder if Harvard had kept the government funding, if it would have allowed for discounting?

Harvard prohibits Master's students from accessing scholarships and financial aid, so I just paid $75k out of pocket for a half online experience. I had to make a very tough, very costly decision whether to go to Harvard and the main reason I chose to attend (the community) was just cut from beneath me. Had this been any other school, I wouldn't have gone, and I had exactly this conversation with a mentor at work before making this decision; he said if it was any other school, don't go, but for Harvard, the cost might be worthwhile.\n\nSo to summarize: you're wrong, you're arrogant, and the answer to your question disproves your point.",

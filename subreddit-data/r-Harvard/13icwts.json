Has an art gallery, excellent dining hall with some of the best views of the river, fabulous kitchen because it only shares it with one other house, cool library, not one, not two, but THREE common areas for you to watch TV, cook, play pool or ping pong, or just chill. It\u2019s got it\u2019s own kiln. And the low rise is perfectly set up to accommodate parties and the mythical \u201ctunnel party.\u201d It has something for everyone. \u201cBut, u/gacdeuce,\u201d you say, \u201cMather is ugly brutalistic, concrete architecture. It looks like Soviet housing!\u201d  Well, well, well, let me tell you! The Kremlin on the Charles might not be the prettiest or most photogenic house at Harvard. It might even get edited out of a postcard at the Coop every now and then. But when you\u2019re in Mather, you aren\u2019t looking at Mather. You\u2019re looking at the pretty little domes of Dumpster House and it\u2019s neighbors. So, comrade, come to Mather and experience singles for life. And remember, cockroaches can\u2019t live in concrete.",

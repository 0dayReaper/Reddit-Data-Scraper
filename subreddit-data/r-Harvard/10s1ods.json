    "postText": "I am fortunate to have been admitted to Harvard and MIT. Financials aside, i would lean slightly towards Harvard. However, assuming stipends are like this year, my stipend would be ~$7.5k higher at MIT for their respective departments. That difference just seems to big to pass up, especially considering that the two schools are in the same area.\n\nI\u2019m going to guess it isn\u2019t possible but figured I may as well ask, does anyone know if there\u2019s any possibility of negotiating your funding?",

            "comment": "The Graduate Student Union at Harvard already did this negotiation - even if you don\u2019t opt into the union is this the agreed rate. I would not recommend hassling the program that accepted you to negotiate as it\u2019s not under their control.\n\nMIT stipends are a bit higher since than Harvard\u2019s right now but there can be differences in guaranteed funding time, other funds you can access for professional development, and how teaching/other additional activities are compensated that varies a lot between the two schools. For instance, my understanding is that teaching after your program obligation to is completed is generally paid at Harvard but is not at MIT. Group cultures are pretty different too - $8K per year is not enough to work in a bad work environment if you don\u2019t gel with the people, and that pool of people is smaller at MIT in most fields. As much as money matters, I would try to put that a little aside at first and pick a place that functionally feels good to you and then consider the finances.\n\nI\u2019ve been at both institutions so I could go on a longer rant about the vibe at both places but that\u2019s enough for here. You don\u2019t say what field you\u2019re in - I\u2019m in biology (neuroscience adjacent - I was accepted to MIT BCS also but chose Harvard) fwiw and i have good friends who did/do physics and math at both places. Feel free to PM me if you want to chat.",

                            "comment": "Technically true, HGSU negotiated the rates for a research assistant and teaching assistant for specific types of students. Though because every Harvard student in science and engineering (which I presume this person is considering becoming because they\u2019re choosing between Harvard and MIT - the latter of which has a vanishingly small number of non-STEM PhD offerings), gets a research assistantship appointment as their primary appointment, this is effectively the same as what is colloquially considered a stipend. I think I\u2019m correct in asserting that my points still stand. \n\nRe: stipends are not wages. Also true by the letter of the law though for STEM students because of my above statement the difference between stipend and Union negotiated wages in practice is how it\u2019s reported on taxes - which the presence of the union did not modify, it was always kind of funky and not consistent between programs. Certainly something that I advise current students on how to navigate but is too inside baseball to be worth consideration for a prospective, IMO",

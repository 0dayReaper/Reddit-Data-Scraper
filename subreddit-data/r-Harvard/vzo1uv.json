    "postText": "Hi y'all! I'm an incoming freshman thinking of concentrating in econ/stats/something along those lines. \n\nI just got my math placement rec and it was for the math 18 - am 22 column thing. I got a 3 on the calc bc exam junior year and honestly I was planning on taking math 1b since I forgot a lot of stuff and was doing a lot of guesswork on the math placement exam. \n\nI checked the flowchart regarding placement results on the math debt website and I barely met their requirement for the math 18 - am 22 section (minimum of 2-2-2 in each of the 3 sections of the math level 3 placement exam). \n\nI'm very conflicted about which math course I should take. I'm probably going to take ec10a, a freshman seminar (i hope i get one), expos20/stat 110? (not sure about this yet) alongside a math course.\n\n Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks!!",

            "comment": "Welcome to Harvard! Glad you're interested in statistics (I teach Stat 110 and co-direct the concentration). \n\nI think you should start with Math 1b. Even if you were only going to ever take one math course at Harvard, I would still say that, since it's much better to have a strong understanding of single variable calculus than a shaky understanding of both single and multivariable calculus.\n\nThen I recommend that you take Stat 110 sophomore fall (which is the most common year to take it, and it will help a lot to have done a little more math first). It's fine to take Stat 110 concurrently with Math 21a or 21b (or various other possible multivariable or linear algebra classes). \n\nIf you want to take a Stat course in your first year, the newly revamped Stat 100 is awesome! It will be offered both semesters, and has no prereq.",

I don't think that's crazy at all, as long as you study 110 really in depth (not just watching lecture videos and reading the book, though that's a good start, but also doing lots of practice problems). Sometimes self-studying is hard (in staying motivated and without access to sections and office hours), but maybe you also have more time on your hands than during a normal semester. \n\nIf you feel you have a good understanding of the material from Chapters 1-11 of the [Stat 110 book](http://probabilitybook.net) then you should be in good shape for Stat 111.",

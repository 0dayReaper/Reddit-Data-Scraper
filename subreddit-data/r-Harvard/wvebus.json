    "postText": "I'm planning on taking math 21a, econ 10a, and a frosh seminar/gened depending on the lottery results. I don't want to wreck my gpa and mental health freshman fall which is why I'm worried about hum 10. I like to read and consider myself a relatively fast reader, but according to the q report, the writing labs aren't considered to be that great, which is why I am questioning if I should take it or not.",

If you're fairly confident, then you should be fine - if its more of a challenge, then the additional instruction time in Expos might be better.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m currently trying to decide where to attend for PhD and am trying to compare funding. From my understanding, universities can only pay for 20hrs a week during the academic year, but at many universities professors will pay double, 40hrs, during the summer.\n\nIs this typically the case for Harvard too, or do you get paid the same year round?",

For STEM, all students get paid for full time work year-round (all STEM PhD programs are fully funded, so you get paid ~45k per year over the 12 months, though there may be a teaching requirement depending on the dept). Not sure about humanities, but I believe they are fully funded too.",

I guess I don\u2019t know the details or reasons of half time appointments, but my UGs \u201chalf time\u201d stipend is a typical monthly stipend, but double that in the summer for \u201cfull time\u201d in the summer",

I\u2019ve only ever seen rats and roaches outside and once in a while, in student common spaces (probably because other people are being nasty).",

They treat, but things will try to come in and if you leave food around and other things they'll find it. People act like they're at home and their parents will get it, or the park-like setting makes them think bunnies and turkeys will be eating what they throw outside.",

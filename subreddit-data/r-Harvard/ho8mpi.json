In fact people can be hired for the mainstream professions without having to attend college. \n\nI re read my post and it seems that the post was communicating a different idea which I did not intend : I am *for* people having an easy time finding and working in any profession they desire to pursue. It is indeed true that many of the \"other\" professions and even the \"not-other\" professions are accessible (or ought to be) to people willing to contribute to society.\n\nI edited my post that has garnered a whopping negative score.  It would have been nice if someone had bothered to tell me that what I was saying may be misconstrued instead of simply expressing disapproval by down voting.",

I also appreciate all the classes they have made available for free online. \n\nHarvard does more than that (hopefully in all the classes) - it is renowned as our alma-mater (spirit mother) for a reason - it imparts a *spirit* which is far greater than the mechanics of videos and lectures &amp; the logistical similarities it may have with MIT or Stanford or any university.",

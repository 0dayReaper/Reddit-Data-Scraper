Apparently this has happened to a few other people.\n\nI just got an email this morning that I was dropped from my summer residency in creative writing due to non payment of the full tuition. However the payment deadline on the summer schedule is listed as May 15 on all website documentation, and in every email I have received. This is an important part of my degree requirements.\n\nI then logged in and confirmed that the residency was no longer showing in my courses and my balance is now zero.\n\nFortunately, I managed to add myself back to the residency in the course catalog. My seat was available on the residency section. I don't know why it didn't get passed to a waitlist student, but I signed back up and paid in full.",

I will complain in writing and we all should do the same. In my case, the reason why I pay towards the deadline and not before is so I pay closer to my employer reimburse date for my existing course (the course I am taking now will be reimbursed once final grade is out which is in a couple of weeks).",

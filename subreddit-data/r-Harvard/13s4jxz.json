In a way they\u2019re like quasi-philosophers whose decisions have societal implications. \n\nHowever, I do get why it can be Slytherin due to other career paths like being a lawyer or working in corporate law firms. \n\nThis is just my guess based on no direct experience with HLS culture. Perhaps the actual HLS culture is more Slytherin, would love to hear!",

The whole point of squibs is that they are non-magical, so if they know about Hogwarts which they should being descended from witches and wizards they would actually show up with an acceptance letter and it is only once at Hogwarts their non-magical abilities will be revealed.\n\nAs for your attack on HES, it\u2019s a graduate school of Harvard, we are taught in many cases by Harvard faculty and we graduate with Harvard degrees. You clearly don\u2019t rate the school but Harvard does and so do employers. As for the quality of HES students at HES perform very strongly for example students in the pre-medical programme have an 85% acceptance rate into medical school compared to a national average of less than 30%. Such students have gone on to HMS and other Ivy League medical schools repeatedly. Approx. a third of HES Masters students go onto PhD\u2019s including at Ivy League and other top institutions. Anecdotally I know of at least half a dozen students that I took classes with for my masters that are going into further masters and PhDs at top institutions including other schools at Harvard, several Ivy League schools and Oxford and Cambridge.  So hey don\u2019t rate HES if you don\u2019t want but don\u2019t pretend what you say is the objective truth about the school.",

Much like how Harvard operates HES but does not conflate HES with the rest of Harvard, the Summer School and HES are also separate entities under DCE. The handbook specifically states that Harvard students are not allowed to take HES classes for credit. To suggest otherwise is a lie. An HES student being admitted to Harvard for graduate work means that their prior individual work, recommendations, test scores, personal statement/writing sample, and interview were such that the admissions committee wanted them. Those committees are well aware of what HES is and also what it is not. That's no different than any student applicant to Harvard from any university anywhere, and has no bearing on the fact that HES students aren't the same as Harvard students proper (although if they are admitted as you describe, they certainly become so). Also, there is no factual basis for your claim of \"all the time.\" I have been around several of these institutions and not met a single HES alum, nor do I know anyone personally who has (I do know *of* one who later graduated from HKS and another who did grad school at Yale. Awesome!). I'm sure a few do get admitted here or there but that has to do with the substance of their individual work and quality of their application materials, not their educational background. If anything, I think the majority of HES students would run into difficulty due to their work having been done online and a lack of meaningful physical access (for most) to faculty and other resources.\n\nThe fact is that Harvard does not see HES as equal, as evidenced by the fact that they give HES students degrees of \"liberal arts in extension studies,\" charges them a lower tuition rate, allows open admissions and a 100% acceptance rate for the extension studies degree, prohibits them from accessing open cross registration, limits the classes they take outside HES to two classes only (for which they must apply to take), and prohibits them from accessing/living in both undergraduate and graduate Harvard housing, among *many* other differences. I am not trying to be convinced nor trying to convince, I am simply stating fact.",

The summer school is managed by the Dean of DCE the same one who manages HES. \nThe handbook specifically states college students can take summer school classes for credit and those classes are DCE classes run by and taught by HES lecturers and sanctioned by the DCE Dean that sanctions all HES classes. \nThe reason the degrees are named liberal arts is to distinguish them from the College due to the fact originally the Extension issued ALB degrees (no mention of extension) and the College AB degrees. The extension part is a later addition though I don\u2019t see it matters. \nThere is no 100% acceptance rate for the extension degrees indeed it\u2019s around 30%, this is lower than legacy students at the College with a 50% admissions rate. HES students can access accommodation indeed the until recently when he graduated the president of the Harvard Extension Student Association was living on campus at Harvard. I know of others that have done so. \nSo again for someone who claims to be spouting facts you don\u2019t seem to have a tendency to be accurate about these alleged facts.",

My point here isn\u2019t to try and convince you of anything, it\u2019s to make sure that anyone who reads this is aware of the misrepresentations and falsehoods you are posting. I\u2019ll address just one, to prove my point- you can google Harvard housing and find links to both the undergraduate housing system at the college and HUH graduate student housing websites, which specifically state that extension students are \u201cnot eligible.\u201d What they can do is SUBLET an HUH apartment from an actual Harvard student, which would be highly unlikely to happen since that student is probably living in their housing (at least over the school year). Alternatively, extension student could conceivably live in the college houses during the summer only, when all the college students are moved out. During the summer, the houses are filled with everyone from high school students to random adults to extension students have at enrolled in Harvard Summer School, which is also entirely open enrollment. \n\nAnyone can find that out (and all of this, like the fact HES is totally open admissions with a 100% acceptance rate) with a simple Google. Unless he was subletting from a Harvard student, your extension friend was not living \u201con campus,\u201d if by on campus you mean housing that is owned and operated by Harvard. Again, facts. Here\u2019s at least one link:\n\n1. https://www.huhousing.harvard.edu/application-process/eligibility-and-occupancy-guidelines#:~:text=To%20qualify%20for%20housing%2C%20you,March%201%2C%202024%20or%20later. \n\nOh also, I looked up the LinkedIn profile of who I think you\u2019re talking about. He\u2019s currently engaged in academic fraud by misrepresenting his degree and status as an extension student by leaving out the \u201cin extension studies\u201d bit in the degree title. That\u2019s the sort of thing that is so common among extension students though, and nobody who actually attended Harvard or is familiar with it is going to be fooled by that sort of conduct, nor by your spurious claims here.",

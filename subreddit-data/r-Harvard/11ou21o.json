    "postText": "Hello there, \n\nI am an admitted student at HGSE for 2023/24. Currently, I am admitted with a concentration in Educational Leadership, Organization, and entrepreneurship. However, I want to change my concentration before I start my studies. Can anyone guide me or help me in this case, especially folks who have worked or have the know-how of the Registrar's Office at HGSE? Kindly inbox me for further discussion. I would be highly thankful to you as it is an important step for me. Thank you.",

I\u2019d go on the page on the HGSE website and email the assistant director for ELOE or the connect with admissions contact listed there as a first step. Best of luck!",

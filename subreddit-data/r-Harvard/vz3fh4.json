    "postText": "I'm an astrophysics concentrator starting my sophomore year and I'm deciding on a math class. I took the math 1a/1b sequence freshmen year and now I'm deciding between math 21a and math 22a. How different are the classes content-wise, workload-wise, and difficulty-wise? I'm also wondering which is considered more compatible with Harvard's physics and astronomy classes. Thank you!",

            "comment": "22a definitely deeper content, more workload, and slightly more difficult.  in terms of compatibility with Harvard's physics and astronomy classes, I would say you could be good with both, but 22a will build you a better foundation. hope you have a wonderful semester. miss my days back at harvard. covid kind of wiped out my junior and senior years. good luck.",

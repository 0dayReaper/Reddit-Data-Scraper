[As of yesterday, we've launched our mobile app's open beta, enabling users to stream multiple articles back-to-back](https://testflight.apple.com/join/FB0fe0hn). \n\nThe Narrativ team would love to get your feedback throughout our open beta! Specifically:\n\n1. Features that you like / don't like / want to add\n2. UI / UX that feels good or clunky\u00a0\n3. Audio quality\u00a0+ where you experience bugs\n4. Anything\u00a0else that you'd like to share!\u00a0\n\nPlease email our team your thoughts directly at support@narrativ.ai or via the TestFlight\\* app. Thanks very much for your support!",

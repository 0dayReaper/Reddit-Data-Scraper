    "postText": "Hi everyone, hoping to get some guidance on what class might be best for this coming fall. I originally planned to do CS 61 and then 32 in the spring (to knock off a requirement and have a more chill course load), but I\u2019ve heard CS 124 is an important course to take for internship/interview prep and that CS 120 is a good course to take to prepare for 124 in the spring. \n\nLooking at the q-guide, it seems 120 would be slightly less of a commitment than 61, but I\u2019ve also heard that 61 is good for teaching raw programming skills vs 120 is better for theory. I have a few questions as I try to make my decision:\n\n1) How helpful will taking 120 before 124 be if I have extensive proof experience in math (not CS though)?\n2) Is it better to take 124 sophomore or junior spring w respect to prepping for internships (if it matters at all)?\n3) How useful is CS 61 as a class for building tangible coding skills?\n\nThanks a lot!",

            "comment": "1. It's somewhat helpful in terms of learning how to write proofs of correctness and a basic understanding of algorithms, but I don't think it's that crucial to taking 124. I took 120 before 124, and to be honest, it doesn't help that much. I found 120 super easy, but 124 was just on a completely different level. \n2. Take it sophomore spring. Your whole understanding of data structures and algorithms will be enhanced, which will make coding interviews much easier. \n3. Fairly useful. \n\nOverall, if I redid sophomore year again, I probably would have taken CS61 over CS120. The relevant material (for internship/interview prep) in CS120 is already covered in CS124 at a more advanced level. CS61 introduces you to systems programming, which will help you more over taking two algorithms/DS courses that overlap in terms of material.",

I had thought I could take 124 junior year but will switch it to the spring.\n\nFor 124, I was wondering what you / other people found the most difficult. Was it the proof/math aspect or the coding aspect (or just everything \ud83d\ude2d)? And in that respect would you recommend any particular preparation for 124 in the spring based on your experiences?",

There are a few programming assignments that can be a bit tricky when dealing with time and space complexity, but I wouldn't say they are difficult. \n\nThe most difficult part of CS124 is easily the exams, which basically decide your entire grade in the course since most people are getting As on their problem sets and programming assignments. \n\nIn terms of preparation, there isn't really necessarily a way to strictly prepare, but I'd say trying to improve your problem-solving and critical thinking skills would help through practice problems in common data structure and algorithms books like [CLRS](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844). Leetcode may help a bit, though the problems in 124 are a tad bit more difficult than what you'd typically see in an interview.",

Looks like I have some studying to do before then haha.\n\nWould you say the exams are pretty fair around the material they cover vs. what is taught? I.e. would it be fair to say that if you start studying early and in great depth you will do well?",

It is possible that I will be taking this course as a graduate student coming from overseas, and I wish to understand exactly what is necessary to smoothly adjust to this course.\n\nBackground: I have some experience in Calculus, Linear Algebra, basic statistics and basic Python programming but that's about it (I didn't do a technical/quantitative major in undergrad so you can take that into account in your answer). I'm required to take a CS elective (has to be above CS100) for my course requirements so I have been looking for doable courses I can take with my current level without consuming much study time (I'm not trying to become a software engineer btw, just interested in satisfying the CS elective requirement). CS120 definitely seems to satisfy my criteria at first glance but I'm not too sure. \n\nIs my background enough for me to complete this course easily, or is more required in your opinion? I would appreciate your advice!",

The combination of science with history of science was enjoyable and memorable (only occasionally did a history topic feel shoehorned in without the necessary detail to make it worthwhile). Prof Berry is an exceptionally entertaining lecturer, Prof Browne is also good, the course was well-designed and not hard (fyi, lecture attendance was de facto required, so if you don't want to go to class then don't take it).",

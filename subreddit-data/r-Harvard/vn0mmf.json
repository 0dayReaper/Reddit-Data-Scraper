When I was at Boston University for undergrad, typically the undergraduate population was 22 or younger and there is a reason why a lot of people make friends in college, as the age range is very similar and you are going through the same life-experiences. HES is mostly for working adults and there is a requirement that you need to have graduated from high school at least five years out before applying to the ALB program.",

And I live somewhere with no quality 4 year school in reasonable commuting distance. Was unable to secure a dorm because of my age at a local public college in the past.",

But the College is significantly harder to get into than the Extension School, so it's not something I would bank on. There are definitely non-traditional older students at the College, but they typically have really strong reasons for being non-traditional. For example, being an Olympic athlete, or working for a big tech company after high school, or being an actor, just to name a few off the top of my head.",

I\u2019m still an undergrad and I\u2019m very low income (SSI / self-employment) and in a dead end hole financially that I\u2019m trying to dig myself out of. I\u2019m a MA resident so I\u2019m not *too* far from campus but I am disabled and don\u2019t drive or have a car and live at home across the state with one disabled parent and one who works constantly and can\u2019t transport me. So I would have to be given money by my parents for the room or huge amounts for Uber every day unless I could secure something or get a job in Cambridge that pays the rent for a semester",

Then you use FAFSA for the rest.  \n\nAlso, on campus requirements at HES can be met using weekend intensive courses.  So the 4 on-campus courses can be completed in 4 weekends (a total of 8 hotel nights).  Not cheap but far less expensive than spending a semester in a dorm.",

Much easier on the wallet when it comes to housing, although I see others have recommended the special student/summer term housing. Second-best to the ALW option is the J-Term, which is 3 weeks long.",

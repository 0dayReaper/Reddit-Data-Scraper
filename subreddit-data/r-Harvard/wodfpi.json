    "postText": "Hi. Tested in Math Ma, and I'd really like to get a double concentration in Gov/econ. unfortunately, with econ 10a, gov 20, expos 20, and hopefully a freshman seminar, I can't start math ma till the spring. i know econ requires both math ma and MB, to get the concentration, and take several other required classes. Is it possible to take math ma this spring, math mb next fall, and still get through required econ courses? I also took AP calc Ab and Bc, so I could ignore the placement test and take math 1a in the spring, but I don't know how wise that is. Any advice is appreciated",

However, Harvard does have a diverse student body and a vibrant campus life with plenty of clubs and activities to get involved in.\r  \n\r  \nRegarding the applied mathematics program, Harvard has a strong mathematics department with renowned professors and research opportunities. However, I encourage you to research each program thoroughly and compare their curriculums, faculty, and resources to determine which best fits your academic interests and goals. As an undergrad at harvard, however, you will have limited exposure to the business school program.   \n\n\nIf you got into Wharton for undergrad, and you want to do a business concentration, then that is a really good fit. In your case, despite the fact that I would have liked to recommend Harvard, don't you yourself think that Wharton is the best fit? If not, why not? At the undergrad level, however, it doesn't matter that much. You cannot go wrong with any of these choices.\r  \n\r  \nI can understand why you asked about \"hot people\". It sounded like you wanted to make your question more relatable and/or cool. Now, as for your question about attractiveness, I believe that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and everyone has different tastes. But Harvard students come from all over the world, so you're bound to meet some interesting and attractive people during your time here.\r  \n\r  \nOverall, Harvard is an excellent institution with a strong reputation in both academia and the business world. It's up to you to determine which school is the best fit for you academically and socially, and I wish you the best of luck in making your decision.",

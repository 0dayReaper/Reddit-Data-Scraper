    "postText": "I know it can be really annoying to see posts from high schoolers so I apologize in advance and I won't ask you where I should go, but I'm a high schooler choosing between Duke, Northwestern, and Harvard, and I was wondering if anyone could give their thoughts on the entrepreneurship scene at Harvard. Do people not have time for it? Do people have opportunities and resources for it?\n\nI'm also thinking of double concentrating in Econ and Envir. Sci. and Engineering, and although I have a lot of AP credits, I'm not sure just how time-consuming that would be. \n\nAny thoughts would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",

Dorm Room Fund, Rough Draft, etc have big presences on campus and 5-10 students every year drop out or go on leave and go raise a round or go through YC. Your peer group is unmatched here\n\nStanford/MIT are probably the only schools in the country that do it better",

If you have an interesting idea, it seems like you could get connected to various funding opportunities as well. While there might not be many classes centered around entrepreneurship, there are a couple that do (ES94, ES95r). Harvard also brings very interesting people to its campus. For example, in class today (ES94) we met one of the Co-Founders of Nextdoor in person, and we met Biz Stone (original founders of Twitter) in person as well in ES95. There are also some opportunities that you can persue at the business school including HBS's Tech Fellows and possibly some cool research opportunities with HBS professors.",

They have two classes called CE10 and CE11 that bring in tons of guest speakers and offer resources to help ventures. They also do community events and run an accelerator with the school of public health. It's called the Lemann program on creativity and entrepreneurship",

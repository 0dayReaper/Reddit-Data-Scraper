    "postText": "We have been looking for a place to live for several months. Found this perfect apartment and were so happy. Thought we could move in on July 1st and everything, then right before we were about to put down a deposit we noticed the transaction was a wired payment to someone with a different name than the lease we were going to take over. Turn out it was all a scam\u2026. Found the same address on another post listing, but in Spanish. Is this a common thing? Any recommendations to find housing or safe places of listing?",

We liked Zillow because the vetting process seems strong so there are few if any scams, and you can set up filters with email alerts so that you get notified immediately when a place gets listed that fits your specs. \n\nThe competition is fierce, but if you act fast and you\u2019re willing to rent site unseen (we did), then I think you\u2019ll eventually be successful. Took us 3-4 applications before we lucked out with the one we signed for.",

When applying for a programme, does HKS consider the financial status of the applicant? If the applicant's family is receiving minimum income will the school pay for the tuition (as is the case with undergrad applicants)?\n2. From your experience (those who got in) , what is it that HKS looks most for in an application? I know this is a very broad question - but some general guidelines would be greatly appriciated.\n3. Finally, how much of an impact do letters of recommendation play in? \n\nMany thanks!",

I am not sure if they are looking for anything specific. I was convinced I wouldn\u2019t get in. But check out Grad Cafe and you\u2019ll get a better understanding of what most admitted applicants have. From my understanding is seems like everyone has a demonstrated, multi-year commitment to their interest in their work experience, a defined and specific interest, good to great GRE scores, excellent GPA from a reputable if not exceptional school, excellent letters of rec, a unique background, and beautifully crafted essays.",

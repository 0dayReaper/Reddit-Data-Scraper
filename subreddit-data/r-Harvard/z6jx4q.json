Do they take away ID swipe access for people who have not filled out the form? \n\nBasically, if someone just stayed on campus without approval, how would they know? ",

Campus becomes a ghost town. Staff and offices ACTUALLY close. People go on vacation. So you don\u2019t want to find out at 1 AM you don\u2019t have access to your room when it\u2019s freezing cold and you\u2019re standing outside. \n\nAlso in general \u201casking for forgiveness rather than permission\u201d isn\u2019t wise. You can get in hot water after the fact AND remember, you\u2019ll probably be a student here for awhile. You don\u2019t wanna be the person that throws up a middle finger to staff and rules because &lt;whatever your reasons are&gt;: the people you\u2019d be causing extra work for are the same people who you might need to support you in some other thing later on. I\u2026may have done this once upon a time here  and oh man I had to eat some humble pie.",

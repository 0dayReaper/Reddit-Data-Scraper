    "postText": "Hi, due to work I'd been in the Boston area for a while. Now I'm finishing my second semester pursuing a graduate 16 credit certificate. \n\nCan someone recommend to me how to take all the advantages of living near the campus? \n\nAs a HES course taker I have a Harvard ID card.  I accessed the library and can take books, but what else can I take advantage of? Study groups? Events? Cultural activities?\n\nThanks for reading.",

My name is Lili and I am a gap year student who was admitted to Harvard's Class of 2026 and will be entering the fall of 2023. \n\nI'm super anxious about making friends and connecting to the Harvard community while I am in my gap year. It seems like so much is happening and I am super worried about missing out!! T\\^T Any advice?",

It\u2019s like freshmen feeling left out because sophomores already have their houses. There\u2019s not really a point to it because it\u2019s going to happen with the class that you\u2019re in eventually.",

Focus on yourself, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to connect to class of 2027 and 2026 in the future",

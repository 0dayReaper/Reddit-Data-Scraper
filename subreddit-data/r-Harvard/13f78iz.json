    "postText": "I'm committed to Harvard and am aware of their AP score requirements (5 for placement but not credit), but was wondering if performing poorly on my recent AP's will put me in danger of my offer being rescinded. I was contemplating canceling my scores before they were sent because I don't want them to see, but wasn't sure if it mattered. Does anyone know if AP scores are grounds for being rescinded post-commitment?",

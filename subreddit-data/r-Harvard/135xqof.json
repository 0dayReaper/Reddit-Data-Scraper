I got paid the same as many other campus jobs, and the publications that I managed to get helped me win scholarships for grad school. I also switched labs a few times, which helped me find what I really liked, academically. \n\nHowever, jobs that let you do homework while at work also sound pretty good.",

Sometimes I was paid hourly and I had to submit a time sheet, other times I was given a lump sum stipend for the semester. Sometimes I did it for course credit and then I didn't get paid.",

But the work had a sort of meditative quality that helped my head immensely that first year. It was also the type of job where you could \u201cwrite papers in your head\u201d sort of, doing the thinking about them so when you were in front of the keyboard, you could just knock it out.\n\nBut, most importantly, you will shed something that many of your fellow students will not admit to having until much later: a fear of Widener Library. Some just refuse to go in there, which is a shame, because it\u2019s one of the best libraries on the planet.",

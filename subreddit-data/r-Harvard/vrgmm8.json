    "postText": "Hi, everyone! I'm in the class of 2026 and have a few questions about course selections. (Small disclaimer: I know I can probably get these questions answered whenever we meet our advisors, but I'm just very confused, have anxiety, and am trying to do some planning.)\n\nSome background: 1) I want to concentrate in Social Studies and 2) my language requirement has been fulfilled with an AP score.\n\n1. In addition to Expos, I was thinking about taking an Econ class (since that's a requirement for Social Studies) and a Gen Ed in Ethics &amp; Civics (recommended as a gateway course for Social Studies), but I'm unsure what to do for my fourth course and would appreciate any advice.\n2. Along the same lines, should I try to satisfy as many of the Gen Ed/distribution/quantitative reasoning requirements in my freshman year?\n3. I was also hoping to continue studying Spanish in college, but I'm slightly worried for how this could fit in my schedule with the requirements (both the general ones and the Social Studies ones).\n4. Is it worth it to take a freshman seminar/what are the pros and cons of taking one? And do most freshmen take one, or is it only a select few?\n5. For Econ: I took AP Micro and AP Macro this past year and found it pretty manageable (though I was somewhat checked out during AP Macro with senioritis...). Should I still take Econ 10A and 10B, or should I take a different course?\n6. Probably dumb, but do the Gen Ed courses fulfilling the 4 areas have to be 4 separate courses, or can one course fulfill multiple areas?\n\nThanks so much! :)",

            "comment": "1. Don\u2019t count on expos this semester, you have a 50/50 chance of having it now or in the spring (unless you\u2019ve already been assigned it this semester). Freshman seminars are good to fill the 4th slot, or you could take a language. \n\n2. Eh you can space it out more, that\u2019s what I did and it was nice to change things up a bit. It is nice to have more flexibility later though. In the long run, you have enough electives it shouldn\u2019t be a problem either way. \n\n3. You\u2019ll have plenty of space to continue a language in college, especially since most people need to take it anyway. I would recommend taking it freshman year because you lose a lot very quickly if you wait a year in between classes. \n\n4. It\u2019s very much worth it if you can find one that interests you, it acts like a release valve on your schedule. In my experience, maybe 60-75% of freshmen take a freshman seminar over their first two semesters (honestly maybe more)\n\n5. AP Micro and Macro are in no way a substitute for Ec10a/b, I would recommend taking them. \n\n6. GenEds can only fulfill one requirement each. If it has multiples listed, you can choose which one it fulfills.\n\nHope this helps! I\u2019ve been a Peer Advising Fellow the past two years so I\u2019ve had some experience advising freshmen.",

            "comment": "The other comment made some great points but just a note on the freshman seminar\u2014 from my own first year advisor, freshman are really pushed to take these seminars by Harvard but in my advisor\u2019s experience it was actually more common for people to dislike their seminar because it\u2019s not a given that you\u2019ll become close to your professor and some can have lots of work. I would only recommend that you take a freshman seminar if you get into one that you\u2019re genuinely fascinated by. If you want the seminar ONLY to ease into college, just know that it\u2019s pass/fail so it doesn\u2019t affect your GPA. Meaning, if you have some other hard classes it won\u2019t pad your GPA at all. I personally wish I had done a gened my first year because it would\u2019ve been the same amount of work, but an A in a gened would\u2019ve helped my GPA whereas the pass didn\u2019t mitigate that I got 2 B+ and 1 A. \n\nSource, also a PAF. My main point is if you get into the one that you feel like you can\u2019t live without, do it! But be careful about taking one that\u2019s less interesting just to make your semester easier, considering the GPA component.",

            "comment": "The other comments answer the brunt of it, but I would highly recommend you take Spanish. I'm not exactly sure at which level you would be entering at, I assume around 40+ level. I took 40 last semester and really enjoyed the class, and have heard amazing things about the teaching staff and the other higher level courses. You probably will have space for the class, although I will warn you that my schedule for next semester is going to have 3 consecutive classes because there is only one Spanish section that works for me.",

            "comment": "The other comments answered your questions very well, but just my own input :) I had one gened each semester my freshman year and I thought it was a good idea so I won\u2019t have to worry so much later. However I ended up being one of the only freshmen in the course which was a bit intimidating at first but in no way affected my grades or anything. I personally didn\u2019t take a freshman seminar because I wasn\u2019t selected for one lol. I\u2018m taking a language in addition to my concentration and secondary so it can be possible! You only need 4 language courses for a citation :)",

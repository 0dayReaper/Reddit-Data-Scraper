    "postText": "Hello guys, I\u2019m wondering are there any music concentrators or graduate students in the music department at Harvard. I\u2019m currently a first-year undergrad majoring in Music at Oxford and I hope to apply for a PHD in musicology in the US. Harvard graduate school attracts me a lot due to their encouragement in interdisciplinary research and huge amount of funding. I am very interested to know more about the department, are there any students in here that work closely with the music faculty?",

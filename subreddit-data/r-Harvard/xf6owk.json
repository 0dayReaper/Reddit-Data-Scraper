Most are from southern schools (especially A&amp;M), but I had a guy once that immediately ask when I graduated Harvard because of my ring. It\u2019s nice as a little conversation starter, but their popularity differs depending on the place.\n\nI can't remember the last time I noticed someone wearing a Harvard class ring in the wild, and I work with many Harvard graduates and current faculty, but perhaps this type of thing is valued in different fields more than mine.",

It's stainless steel - super durable, doesn't tarnish, and it's the most affordable metal they make it in. \n\nI wear a lot of rings, so this being silver, blends right in with all my others if I wear it. \n\nDo I wear it a lot? Nah. Is it worth it to have? I think so. Once I'm old, I'm sure I'll be glad I've got this little reminder.",

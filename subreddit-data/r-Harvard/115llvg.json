    "postText": "Hey, so i'm very concerned about my financial aid situation. I'll be renewing my CSS and FAFSA soon but realized that we have to submit 2021 tax files. My parents' 2021 tax file came out to be around $164k but only because of capital gains over covid but there was a huge decline and in our 2022 tax file, it comes out to around $70k. If we go with 2021, I might have to pay 25k a year for next year but are they flexible with this kind of stuff because they said we can include 2022 info if there is a decline. But i'm unsure if they'll actually consider my situation or not cuz my family income has never been over 70k before 2021. Please help im stressing.",

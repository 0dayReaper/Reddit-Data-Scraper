    "postText": "According to my placements, I can take Math 21a/b. Would it be alright for an incoming freshman to take Math 21b?\n\nAlso, when choosing between gen-eds, should one choose gen-eds that are \"easy As\" or  gen-eds that are both more challenging and you could learn possibly more from compared to the \"easy\" gen-ed? I am not sure if I want to prioritize grades or learning something that will be more useful/substantial to me (granted all courses would teach you something useful, just some more than others).  \n\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated!",

I\n\nThis is a big old \"it depends.\"  Personally, I would choose a gen ed on a topic in which you have some interest, and the instructor is good, vs a course that is an easy A, but carries zero interest for you.. ideally, you'd find one of the gems with a great instructor, interesting subject, lower-than-average workload, and easy A.",

            "comment": "Why do you want to take 21b, because you want to do linear algebra before multi? If so, consider Math 22a, while it\u2019s a bit more proof-based it starts with linear and then goes to multi in 22b. \n\nIn my opinion, GenEds tend to be pretty similar difficulty wise, but some will be more annoying than others in how much they make you do to get a good grade. So look for the easy GenEds, but also try to find ones that are at least slightly interesting to you.",

I am truly lost in terms of if I want to push myself and choose one that will make me work harder for that \"A\" or one that is more relaxed.",

People generally take them to lighten their course load. Still take it seriously and everything but you will probably be fine in whatever you pick.",

If you\u2019re studying something like CS (which only requires a linear algebra course to fulfill the math req), then 21B is probably your best option unless you are interested in proof-based math (for that I would recommend 22a-55a)\n\n2.

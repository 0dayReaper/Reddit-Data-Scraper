    "postText": "Apparently college students need to report money that we get that goes towards room and board. However, Harvard gave me my financial aid statement as 1 number that didn't specify what part of the money went to tuition, room and board, etc. I can't tell if my room and board was covered by aid or if my parents paid it with the amount due for us, so I'm not sure if I have to report it on my taxes. Any advice? Thank you!!",

            "comment": "Not a CPA, but my understanding is that if you didn\u2019t work outside of getting financial aid (as in were not issued a W2 or 1099) I don\u2019t think you need to file. If your financial aid did not cover all of your expenses (which if sounds like it does not) - I would presume the amount you got was not taxable (as in used for a qualified educational expense - literally anything school\nrelated except room and board). Unless the amount you got in fin aid/scholarships exceeds the amount of attendance (as it does for most grad student but not undergrads), you don\u2019t need to report it. Most regular domestic undergrad students need not do much else other than file a 1040EZ with your W2/1099 info as applicable. If your parents can claim you as a dependent and deduct interest on loans for your school/other expenses via a 1098T that will be on their filing not yours. \n\nI didn\u2019t file until I had a job until mid-way through 2nd year and then basically just reported my W2 info every year until I got more adult things like an investment account, a car, and a spouse. Haven\u2019t been audited yet. Hope this helps!",

    "postText": "Accepted (and committed slay!) student here. I had signed up for 5 AP exams and reported that I planned on taking them in my application before I knew what would happen on Ivy Day, and I learned that Harvard doesn't accept any credit. Also, the score report sheet doesn't even show up on my application pdf, so I doubt they even looked at it. To get rid of the stress for studying, is it allowed to cancel the scores?  I do IB as well, and plan on taking the exams just to get the diploma, but the AP is just an add-on that I don't find necessary for my mental health in may lmao. Have people cancelled their exams before and was the college fine with it? Thanks!",

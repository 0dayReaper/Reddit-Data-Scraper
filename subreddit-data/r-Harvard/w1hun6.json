    "postText": "Hello!! I'm an incoming freshman hoping to concentrate in Government who is completely and utterly lost choosing classes. Does anyone have any advice on a government class that might be good for my first semester? I'm particularly interested in international relations, and since I also want to take Hum10a and Econ10a, I'd prefer a class without a crazy large workload. Any suggestions?\n\nAlso, would you recommend/is it possible to bypass taking an intro Government class (Gov 10/20/30/40) and instead take a 1000 level class first semester? Or taking a government-related GenEd instead?\n\nThank you immensely for your help, and I apologize for my cluelessness :)",

            "comment": "I would definitely recommend bypassing the intro classes (10-40) and taking a higher-level course if there are any that align with interests you have! I always advise this route. They're much more interesting (and often much less work, actually).\n\nIt'd be difficult to recommend a specific course without knowing your more detailed interests beyond international relations, though.",

I ate every meal in my House and did all my studying and homework in the dining hall, because it was a place I could just show up and know there would be some people I knew and liked.\n\nBetween day-to-day life, intramurals, House events, basement hangouts, study breaks, etc. essentially my whole life revolved around my House community.\n\nNot everyone is interested in the House culture, and they find their social life in the Final Clubs or sports teams or whatnot - and that's fine.  But if you want to socialize with Housemates, that is pretty much an option 24/7.  I miss it a lot!",

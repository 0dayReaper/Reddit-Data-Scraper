    "postText": "I've stumbled upon a bit of Harvard history that has me completely baffled.\n\nPrison reformer and Harvard alumnus [Thomas Mott Osborne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mott_Osborne) \u2014 Harvard University 1884, Harvard Law School 1887 \u2014 voluntarily entered Auburn Prison to live as a prisoner for one week in 1913. In his 1914 book ***Within Prison Walls*** that recounts the entire episode, he details going through the admission process of the prison where [he states the following](https://archive.org/details/cu31924100610371/page/n61/mode/2up):\n\n\"Then a series of measurements from top to toe is taken, and every possible means of identification noted and registered: color of hair and eyes; shape of head; characteristics of eyes, nose, mouth; the scar received at football thirty-four years ago, which I supposed was successfully concealed by my right eyebrow; the minute check on the left ear from a forgotten frostbite; the almost imperceptible bit of smooth skin on the back of my right hand, where a small lump was once removed by electricity; no blemish or defect is over-looked\u2014until I begin to feel like a sort of monstrosity.  \n\"I derive some satisfaction, however, from the fact that my business-like inquisitor is quite at a loss to account for **six peculiar scars upon my upper left arm, familiar to Harvard men of my generation**. It is some satisfaction to know that my Alma Mater has not sent many of her sons to take a post-graduate course in this institution.\"\n\nAfter much research I have yet to discover *any* information about what those \"six peculiar scars\" are, exactly. Why six? Why the upper left arm? Were they ever administered on the right arm? Were these scars only familiar to Harvard men of his generation, meaning the 1880s, or was/is this a continuing tradition? Was this a kind of initiation? Or something earned?\n\nI have so many questions... \n\nAbsolutely any help, leads, or sources of information about this bit of Harvard history would be much appreciated. Thank you!",

            "comment": "They're talking about The Dickey Club or *Dickeys* and whatever else he joined after. We know part of the initiation rituals involved the branding with an iron on the upper arm, though in the 1890s there was incident involving cigar burns as well that led to some medical issues and angry letters at the family wanting the University to do something about the behavior. The president at the time, Eliot, basically said it's between them nothing he can do -- and even if they clamped down on the drinking they drink more in town anyways.\n\nDickeys came out of DKE, a fraternity out of Yale with different societies for freshman vs sophmores vs seniors. More secret/elite societies would then choose members from DKE to join. When DKE came to Harvard it kind of morphed into it's own thing but the behavior stayed the same even if the names of the clubs changed. e.g., sophmores would be invited into Institute of 1770, and the more socially-affluent would then be invited into Dickeys, and the Final Clubs like Porcelain and Fox and others then selected members from them.",

The Dickey Club info led me to this bit of information from an editorial found in the January 1892 edition of the Chi Phi Chakett ([pp. 94-95](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Chi_Phi_Chakett/QAITAAAAIAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22The+Dickey+Club%22+arm+brand&amp;pg=PA94&amp;printsec=frontcover)):\n\n\"The secret society known as the D. K. E. has long been a source of scandal and of private indignation. Aside from the witless penalties attending the initiation of members, a cruelty has been superadded, akin to the barbarism of the Feejee islands, or the practices of degraded Indian tribes. **As a culmination of the ceremonies and as an indication of pluck and endurance, the victim's arm is bared for branding.** In the case which has just come under my observation, **six deep and savage burns, from the shoulder to the elbow, were inflicted with a lighted cigar**. Lifelong scars and disfigurement are bad enough, but the shock to systems already reduced in vitality by previous physical exactions is severe and dangerous. In comparison with a cigar, a branding iron would be merciful, but it seems necessary to add to the danger of the burn that of blood poisoning . . .\n\n\". . . the customs of the Dickey club have received an unenviable amount of attention. The leading American weekly journal printed and embellished with illustrations an account of the ordeal which the most popular students in Harvard are supposed to undergo before becoming members of an organization which, for the last forty years, has included in its membership the leading men in the oldest and, many persons think, the greatest institution of learning in the United States. This account began with the notification of the candidate who is pulled unexpectedly out of bed, and passed down a long line of men to the street and there dropped to scamper back again; through his five days' probation when he is 'running for Dickey,' and is bound to perform every task set for him by any member of the society; **down to the evening when the candidate 'is blindfolded, his arm bared and a freshly lighted cigar is pressed against the arm till the cigar goes out. This is repeated six times, and the result is six little scars, which those who have them regard as badges of honorable distinction** until they forget all about them.'\"\n\nStill, though, why six?",

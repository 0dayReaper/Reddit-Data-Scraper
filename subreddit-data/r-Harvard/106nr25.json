There was an email Thursday from Health Services that, due to the current cases, reemphasized following the existing recommendations but nothing is mandatory.\n\n* mask indoors &amp; on public transit\n* test when returning to campus from home or travel\n* wash your hands\n* keep up with vaccinations\n\nIn Reddit terms, do this or YTA.",

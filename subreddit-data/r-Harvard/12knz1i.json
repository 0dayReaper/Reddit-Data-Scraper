    "postText": "Hey everyone, throwaway account here. I was recently admitted to Harvard as an international student and I wanted to know how much the final IB scores were important. I'm mortified by the thought of getting rescinded and get cold sweats all the time. My predicted IB score is 45, and I don't believe I'll get anything below a 38, but I was thinking if I got a 38 or a 39 I could get rescinded and this is making me terrified. How true is that? I heard final AP exams aren't *that* important, is the same true for IB exams? For internationals?\n\nThank you, and hopefully see you guys on campus next year",

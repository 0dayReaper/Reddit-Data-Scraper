    "postText": "I'm deciding between taking CS107 or CS182 as a possible 2nd CS course in the fall. \n\nI looked at the hours for both, and they don't seem bad which is tempting me to add an extra CS course. For reference, I was thinking of taking ECON 1010A instead of an extra CS course which is like ~8 hrs. Both 107 and 182 seem comparable in terms of the ECON 1010A workload. I have a few concerns with each: \n 1. CS107 worries me because it might be a bit too easy. Yea, I want a \"chiller\" CS course but I don't want to basically learn nothing. I've looked at the syllabus and while it might give me a bit of Python practice, I feel like a lot of the stuff that is covered in terms of data structures, algorithms, and theory was already covered in my previous courses of CS50/CS51/CS20. Other concepts taught in the course are git, version control, and databases (really i.e. sqlite3) which are tools that I already have a good amount of prior experience in + you can easily learn on your own.\n\n\nEdit: Just realized I can't even take 182 because it's at the same time as STAT 110 so ignore my second comment.",

If I were in ur shoes I would say maybe email the cs182 professor and see if it\u2019s possible to take it concurrently with stat110 Bc I know some people that took cs181 without stat110, tho honestly that may defeat the purpose of having an easier class lmao",

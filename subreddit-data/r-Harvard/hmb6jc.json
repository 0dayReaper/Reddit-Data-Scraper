I was listening to a nyt podcast today that said covid isn\u2019t even a respiratory illness, it\u2019s a vascular illness that attacks your blood vessels and causes millions of blood clots in your body. The cough is just a side affect of this, by the time your coughing it\u2019s already done damage to your kidneys, brain, literally every organ. It mutates every two weeks, with a mutation in Italy resulting in it being up to 10x more contagious then the Wuhan strain. \n\nIt\u2019s going to be an absolute shit show at college campuses in the fall. Headlines like \u201cEvery student at Cornell forced to quarantine, 20 dead, over 60% of students positive\u201d. Harvard starting small with a pilot program they are likely to be able to manage is the smart thing to do. And bringing back freshmen first is also the smart thing to do. \n\nYou can be upset at the decision and recognize that it was the right one. I think in hindsight we will recognize that this was the right decision",

If undergraduate instruction is what you want, then you should be at a school like Williams. Research Universities serve to advance research, and the real money is spent on faculty doing research. Undergraduate education is generally consider a lower priority than publishing papers.\n\nStudents attend Harvard for two things: (1) the cachet of the name on the diploma (and from a pure economic utility standpoint the admission letter should have the same value) (2) the political and economic connections one makes on campus. A small number of students also connect to and benefit from direct research opportunities while undergrads, but its not required, hard to do, and only a minority of students do this.\n\nRemote learning undercuts both of these. #2 is clearly lost, but #1 is undercut as people start to question the value of college degrees in general. Why should an firm pay top dollar for a graduate from the COVID years over a student who self-taught themselves the same material with online courses? What is the distinguishing element between the two?",

I don't know anyone who has been at Harvard who could believe this statement to be false. A significant portion of teaching for the first few years is done not by professors but by their graduate students. This is the norm at Harvard and most major research institutions.\n\nAs for thesis it is a very different situation than being actively incorporated into a professors ongoing research activities. At smaller colleges that do not offer graduate programs students can be incorporated into the professors ongoing research as if they were graduate students (in fact they have to be because the professor has no graduate students).",

How do you answer the question \"What makes a Harvard Graduate better than an X graduate?\" Does your answer rely in some way on classroom instruction? Or opportunities outside the classroom? How are those impacted by remote learning? Is Harvard really the best prepared for transitioning to remote learning, or will there be better outcomes for institutions that have focused on \"mass production\" of higher education and have prior experience with remote learning?\n\n&gt; Sure, they run sections and grade assignments -- but the teaching has always been done by the prof \n\nI'm sure it varies by department, but my feeling is that the real learning was from the section, not the lecture. For the record I was a math major, and the real instruction on how to make mathematical arguments was in the detailed feedback we got from the grad students who graded our proofs, not the lectures where we learned the material.\n\nIn later years there would be a big difference between a course taught by a non-tenured professor and tenured faculty. If you could get a tenured professor teaching a course relevant to their area of study... it would be an amazing course, with constant nuggets of wisdom scattered throughout. On the other hand non-tenured faculty had to teach the course and would do so adequately, but you could tell their focus was on their own research not on the instruction.\n\n&gt; cost of having 'ongoing research' that is not interesting/rigorous enough to require grad students\n\nThat certainly is a valid criticism of schools like Williams at least in my field. Most Harvard math majors graduate having completed most of the coursework required of PhD programs in advance of prelims. Whether or not that is actually valuable is a different question entirely.\n\nAs someone who can proudly admit to completing an ABD, I can say its absolutely useless. Could have saved a few years and a lot of grief by being guided through some research as an undergrad and realizing it wasn't my future.",

I\u2019d be surprised if such expenses were unique to that department. \n\nThe best analogy I\u2019ve seen is this: you bought a luxury-class airline ticket, but halfway through the departing flight, through no fault of your own or the airline\u2019s, you had to be relocated to the cargo hold (spring 2020). Then on the return flight you had to spend the entire time down there (fall 2020-). \n\nThe airline could reasonably argue that you got where you were going, which was the point of getting on the plane, but you sure as hell didn\u2019t get what you paid for and you\u2019d have every right to expect some of your money back.",

It ignores that this is about what we make families pay to give their children opportunities and instead frames it as what we make the student pay. I didn't pay for my education, my dad did. (To be even more technical the federal government did through my mother's Social Security benefits that my father diligently saved on my behalf.)\n\n2. It doesn't distinguish between the millionaire class, the multi-millionaire class and the billionaire class. The impact of these means testing programs on families who are saving for college is markedly different. For those in the first group it means meaningful sacrifice, for those in the last it's nothing.\n\n3. In this particular case it is problematic because it ignores the issue of the promised value for money. Any individual who is paying has the right to ask if they are getting what they were promised, even if the relative impact of that broken promise is less. To argue that this isn't wrong in some fashion, is to take the position that the wealthy can be ripped off on any commercial transaction, because it is a relatively smaller impact on them. So sell them a lemon of a car, serve them watery coffee, etc... Nobody appreciates being ripped off.\n\nThe best capitalist model for higher education funding would be one that involves paying schools back with a percentage of lifetime earnings. That would give everyone equal access, and reward successful programs.",

RNA viruses have a lot more replication errors, i.e. mutations, but that tells you nothing about the rate of *consequential* mutations. Yes, each mutation is another \"at bat,\" another chance that it gets better or worse (from the host's perspective) but it's probably not an equal chance.",

I talked to someone who happened to be a doctor (he wasn't wearing a mask). He told me that us talking to each other and me wearing a mask, that there's a 0.00000000001 chance we can get the virus. I happily told him, \"That's sounds great! I'm sure the cops would love to hear that as they are writing you a ticket for not following law regulations set by the governor of California.\"\n\nDoesn't matter how you feel about the whole quarantine issue, the quicker we FOLLOW THE RULES, the quicker things will go back to normal. Trust me, things can be a lot worse. For those students, you just got accepted to one of the most **selective** schools in the world. Not that many people get to say that.",

Harvard owes them nothing \u2014 they haven\u2019t even submitted their final transcripts yet and could defer their acceptance with zero academic consequences. Meanwhile existing students, who were treated unfairly by the school and received a stunted and subpar semester last spring, are given second priority. It\u2019s not ideal to take time off as a junior or senior! Makes no sense to me. There\u2019s not going to be any on-campus networking or orientation activities for the first years because there can\u2019t be (Covid) so might as well bring the students back that have already dedicated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Harvard.",

Even when 100% of students return the freshmen will be outsiders since we won't even know our own college. But taking a gap year isn't as good as it sounds because they can't guarantee housing and there could be consequences for applying to grad schools if '25 is too large of a class.\n\nThe 40% space could've been used for seniors and others who need in person access to Harvard",

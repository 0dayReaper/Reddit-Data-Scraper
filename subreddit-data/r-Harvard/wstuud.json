    "postText": "Hi all! I'm a grad student looking to cross-register into some CS courses at the college because I've always found CS super interesting and intellectually rewarding. Even though I don't plan on pursuing career opportunities within CS, I would like to learn enough of the fundamentals so that I can continue studying CS in my free time/make it a lifelong hobby.\n\n**I'd like to take these 5 courses over the next 4 semesters: CS 50, CS 51, CS 20, CS 121, CS 124**\n\n**3 Questions I'd like to ask you all:**\n\n**1) Are these 5 CS courses enough to learn the fundamentals/build a solid foundation?**\n\n**2) On the other hand, is this plan overkill?**\n\n**3) Will I be alright if I take these CS courses without knowing Linear Algebra? Unfortunately, I'm unable to fit Math 22A into my schedule.**\n\nWould really appreciate any insight. Thanks a ton, everyone!",

            "comment": "1. Yes, these 5 courses combined cover a solid breadth of topics and computer science, and you'll be a competent CS person / programmer after these courses. In fact, these courses cover essentially all the material you'll need for the tech industry. \n2. The typical CS concentrator takes these CS courses in their first 4 semesters at Harvard. As a grad student, you're essentially taking the same courses as CS concentrator+grad courses you have to take for your field of study. Since you don't plan on pursuing career opportunities, I would suggest not really worrying about grades in these classes. Keep in mind you can also take CS50 SAT/UNSAT. If you take these courses with purely the intent of learning and don't put stress on yourself, you should be good to go.\n3. You don't need Linear Algebra for any of these courses.",

            "comment": "1. They are more than enough. \n2. Over 4 semesters no. A common CS schedule you'll see from first-years and sophomores is to take take 50 freshmen fall, 51 and 20 freshmen spring, 120 soph fall (with STAT 110), and 124 soph spring.\n3. You don't need linear algebra per se, but taking a math class builds your mathematical maturity, which will help you a lot in 121 and 124. 121 and 124 are theory classes and are not focused on programming.",

If you don't care/mind about taking your time with your PhD, then go for it, take those courses, but just keep in mind that you want to start research as soon as possible.",

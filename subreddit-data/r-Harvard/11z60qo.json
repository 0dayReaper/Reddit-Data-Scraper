Cheaper, more practical, more low key to park and you could run the engine on idle for air conditioning and keep your shit charged. A comfy sleeping bag in the floor and you're set. Park next to a public restroom. Get a summer student athletic membership and use the MAC or QRAC for showers. \nBut don't leave your electronics in the van. Take all your important s*** with you in a backpack",

Heard muffled commotion a bit behind from the direction of Pusey, heard the door slam open and a guy ran past the aisle with a girl chasing behind by a few lengths shouting something I couldn't understand. By the time I got to the walkway and followed they were gone. I'm assuming they were real because the lighting came on, but there was no noise from the doors closing and no sound of footsteps on the stairwell or shouting. Went into west a bit to see if it was there, went up the stairwell a bit but just nothing. They didn't come back that way, so I guess we'll never know unless one of them sees this and fills us in.",

That weekend, one of those friends comes up to me and says, \"Look, you're in FM!\"  I'm like, WHAT?  \"Yeah, look, isn't this you?\"  Apparently, when I told one of my friends about this while walking around in the Square somewhere, I was overheard -- badly, I might add -- by an FM editor, who printed a badly garbled but still unambiguously recognizable version of my story in the \"Overheard in Harvard Square\" section.  I was friends with an FM editor, so I got her to issue a correction the following week.  I still have that issue of FM around somewhere.",

But the first time it snows and you\u2019re trying to get to Annenberg in sneakers, you\u2019ll totally regret not having boots. LL Bean boots are pretty affordable and do the trick, but really any snow boots will work.",

Even then, I\u2019d only wear them until my usual walking routes were basically cleared. I\u2019d say its better to learn to walk around Cambridge in sneakers without getting soaked for falling.",

Any of major brands can provide everything; they all fit a bit different so may want to try them on this fall. It won\u2019t get really cold until late October/November so you have time. REI, LL Bean, Patagonia, North Face, etc make the full line of stuff; Canada Goose is just coats but mighty good (and expensive) ones. Consider a 2-part jacket system for more flexibility \u2014 it has a fleece layer for cool days and an insulated waterproof layer for cold/wet days. A balaclava to cover your face can also be nice if you prefer that to a scarf. \n\nAlso take a look at your shoes and make sure you have a waterproof pair for when it\u2019s cold and slushy, or hot and raining. Full-on winter boots will be too warm on those days but you want to keep your feet dry.",

They also have excellent boots (I wear a Garibaldi 3 and a Stockholm 2 in the winter, plus have a Vanir Canter for hiking etc.)\nFYI I saw that Nordstrom Rack had their big winter parka marked down from $300 to $79 just days ago...",

If you can't afford one, don't worry about it, you can do just fine with a model from Patagonia, REI brand, or even Uniqlo. I recommend a scarf (I didn't understand how nice they are until I tried one) and a hat of your choice.\n\nA nice pair of long underwear can be handy, although this is personal because sometimes it can get too hot when indoors. Keep in mind you'll likely be going directly from one warm place to another, so you you'll want layer(s) you can easily shed.",

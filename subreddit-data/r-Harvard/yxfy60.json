    "postText": "My mental health has been constantly declining and I\u2019m also thinking I may have ADHD, although I\u2019ve never been tested, which has been making it difficult for me to study. This, along with potential GAD based on symptoms I\u2019ve seen online and research I\u2019ve done. \n\nI\u2019d love to speak with a psychiatrist about the issues I\u2019ve been having and receive a formal diagnosis potentially, as well as actually see if I do have ADHD or something else. Out of paranoia, I don\u2019t want to speak to anyone at Harvard because this is already a big step for me and I get worried the university might freak and take drastic measures if they hear how bad my mental health is. Probably just my paranoia, but alas. I\u2019m committed to getting better but just need to find the right person to get me there. I\u2019ve been holding off on this but it\u2019s time to talk this through with someone. I just don\u2019t want to feel like I have to hold back in conversations to not overly freak out university officials and so on. \n\nWould appreciate recommendations!",

Some offered Tele sessions.\n\nThey do have certain rules, Harvard doctor or not, to keep your treatment confidential, unless they have concerns on public safety.\n\nAlso u r definitely not the first or last to seek mental help at Harvard. They seen it all. So do not worry too much, just go get help soon!",

The University isn't going to freak because you are struggling, they're going to work with you to get you what you need so you can succeed.\n\nNobody wants you to be doing poorly, *especially* the University. The last thing they want is you eroding down to where you arent going to be successful. Asking about this here is a great step towards getting that help, and the next one is going in.\n\nAlso keep in mind more of this is happening than you think vased on how everyone around you seems; outward appearances aren't reality and you are one of many struggling in the programs. If you sprain your ankle, you get it looked at so you can get better, and if you sprain your brain it's the same.",

If you have Harvard insurance you need to contact the referral counselor who will give you a list of numbers or put you in contact with people. I got placed with LifeStance and really like it. All remote.  Even with a non-harvard therapist though, if it\u2019s really /that/ bad you can express s-word thoughts but not active plans. Signed someone whose friends have been (in)voluntarily hospitalized through CAMHS and only narrowly escaped it myself.",

They\u2019re not paid well for the work they do and are stuck in a rigid work environment so they don\u2019t attract the best candidates. I\u2019ve had H therapists tell me to \u201cstop being sad,\u201d say racist shit to myself and friends, and more. If you can put in the work to get a Non-harvard therapist please do bc I personally think they\u2019re much better trained and you get the first 8 sessions covered by insurance than a $35 copay (financial aid may be able to help)",

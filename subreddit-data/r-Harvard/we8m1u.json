    "postText": "I am currently in the process of looking into options for a masters degree course. I have done all my schooling in the UK and am therefore unfamiliar with the US system which I have only just started looking into. \n\nI was looking particularly at the possibility of pursuing a master's degree in Italian or Hispanic studies at Harvard though their website doesn't seem to offer this. The website in fact seems to offer very few masters degrees. \n\nThis may just be me being ignorant here but is this normal? Does Harvard not offer such programs or is the system just very different to the uk whereby it has confused me? \n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Harvard has a [department of Romance Languages](https://rll.fas.harvard.edu/). They offer a PhD in romance languages where students can focus on a particular romance language, but do not offer a standalone master's degree program. \n\nFor the most part, master's degrees in the U.S. are major cash grabs. They can cost ~$50k per year, usually offer no or negligible financial aid, and offer little benefit to the recipient on their own. \n\nIf you're getting a master's degree, it should usually be one of the following cases:\n\n(1) the degree is an end in-itself (e.g. MBA, Counseling/Social Work, for career advancement and paid for by an employer)\n\n(2) the degree is a starting point to get you into a PhD program. In this case, you really need to be sure that getting a PhD is what you want and try your hardest to spend as little money as possible on the master's. \n\nI don't know what path a master's in Italian would open up. Obviously, education isn't only good for career advancement. But a master's degree isn't undergrad, and it is usually too expensive to do just for enrichment.",

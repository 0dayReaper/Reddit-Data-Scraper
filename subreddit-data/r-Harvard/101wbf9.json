    "postText": "Hey guys, I am a sophomore at Harvard concentrating in CS. I feel that I often fall at the lower end of the CS courses here ex. CS51 and CS61. I got a B+ in both of these classes even though I try my very best. I go to every office hour, start early on the psets, go to lectures, read the textbook, etc. How can I do better? Is a B+ a decent grade? Any advice/response would be appreciated!",

If you put the same effort in other CS courses, you probably will get even higher grades at some points. Don\u2019t worry about the grades, just try to understand the material as best you can, and the grades will sort themselves out.",

So: just understand the material. Don't worry. Some of these concepts take a while to seep in.",

Plus, generally communication from the higher-ups tends to be poor (from my experience).\n\nEven if you\u2019re working for tutoring or the Academies (where you\u2019ll be payed more), the work you\u2019re doing still does not necessarily correlate to your pay.\n\nThat said, you shouldn\u2019t be discouraged working for HSA. They are a pretty well-known company (i.e. biggest student-run employer in the US/world) and it can be nice thing to put on your resume (especially if you\u2019re a manager or something).",

You can pull now.*\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.\n\n*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*",

The way that they hardcore advertise to prefrosh and freshman, present them with rentals like the micro fridge in a way that makes it appear to most first years that you can\u2019t have a fridge or a microwave unless it\u2019s this exact one that you rent for $300 a year. And the water service is insane, and having undergrads do laundry for other undergrads is ridiculous no matter how well you pay them. The fact that there\u2019s so many Harvard shops in the area for no reason. The people in charge of HSA act like they\u2019re \u201centrepreneurs\u201d and are so self important it\u2019s not even funny. The whole establishment reeks of elitism and a disdain for the majority of the student body",

    "postText": "There's a seminar I'm especially interested in taking and would be pretty disappointed if I didn't get the opportunity to. Obviously I'd like to do everything I can to be able to have the privilege of taking it. However, if the class falls through, I'd still like to find a way to engage with the content of the course in some manner. Would messaging them help with this? Thank you!",

But if you don\u2019t get it, it\u2019s possible that not all seats initially offered will be accepted, so it might end up on the list of open seats that they post before the registration deadline. In that case, it\u2019s totally appropriate to write the professor to ask for an open seat.",

In my experience, 9/10 professors want to engage with students even in a capacity like that.",

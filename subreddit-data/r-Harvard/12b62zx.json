    "postText": "Helloo, i am a current highschool senior who was just accepted to these schools. I am mainly debating between Harvard and Princeton as they gave me full aid (i have to pay around 10k for mit). I\u2019m also planning on going to grad school for physics. I would appreciate any input on Harvard\u2019s academics, social life, and location. I\u2019m an international student so i am clueless on a lot of things, especially in terms of location (like the whole city life (Boston) vs college town (Princeton) situation). Thank you!",

            "comment": "ok this is pretty long but just to speak a little on social life - it can definitely be really good at Harvard once you find your people, and there are so many opportunities for you to find your people here. As a freshman, you'll spend your entire year eating in Annenberg, where you can sit down and eat with pretty much anyone, especially in the first couple of months. The majority of people (Harvard's website says 98%) remain on campus/in dorms + housing is guaranteed, so it's always really easy to go out and do things with friends as well. I've also heard that house life as an upperclassman is also really great, but there are others that can probably speak more on that (I'm a freshman).\n\nThe international community is also extremely close here, especially if you do the international pre-orientation. As a fellow international student, I thought it was overhyped before I showed up to campus, but I was genuinely shocked at how great the international community is. It really does live up to all the hype.\n\nBeyond that, Boston's a college city/town and it's quite literally just across the river. You'll constantly be running into people from other schools &amp; be invited to mixers with them, and there are always parties going on if that's what you're looking for. I agree with what other people are saying as well; Boston has so much to offer in terms of social life, opportunities, and attractions.",

You can also only do research or stray off somewhat to work as an engineer. Funnily enough some physicists also work on physics for game engines (but this is a very niche job so if it's the only thing you want to do I wouldn't recommend physics). You can also abandon your dignity (/s) and work in finance banking etc., especially if you also get a math degree to go along w it (you don't have to though). Worst case scenario, become a high school teacher (/s) and you won't starve lol (the reason I joke about it is there's this ongoing joke that the destiny of physicists is to become hs teachers). But yeah these are some, hopefully you choose whatever's best for you!",

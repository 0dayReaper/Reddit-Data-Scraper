From what I\u2019ve heard, if you have a strong mathematical background, then you\u2019re more prepared than someone who has an economics background but no math background. \n\nIf you\u2019re worried about economics background, just watch the videos on Khan academy on introductory microeconomics \u2014 the course might take you a week or so if you put in 1-2 hours a day. If you do this, you\u2019ll be more than set.\n\nEdit: clarification",

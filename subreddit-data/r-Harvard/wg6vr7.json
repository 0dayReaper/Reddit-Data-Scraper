That means that even short term options like air b n b or motels or sublets are all getting snatched up and prices too are way way up. \n\nFrankly, there are dozens of thousands of students who HAVE to be here for their programs. If you just wish to be here it might be wise to wait until there is ANY slack in the housing market. \n\nIt\u2019s a bloodbath right now.\n\nEdited to add: good luck! Didn\u2019t want to sound like a bummer but things are brutal right now. Absolutely do NOT come unless you have secure housing lined up. I know folks who just assume it will be fine and they will find something once they\u2019re here\u2026no, not this year.",

It goes up pretty quickly from there.\n\nThe school provides some [links and info](https://extension.harvard.edu/for-students/support-and-services/visiting-campus-and-finding-housing/), but no direct assistance with finding lodging.\n\nEdit: [https://www.harvardhousingoffcampus.com](https://www.harvardhousingoffcampus.com) does have some month-to-month leases, but I'm not sure how far out you could secure one. While HES students don't qualify for student housing, I'm pretty sure you are allowed to sublet them, but be sure to read the fine print first.",

The summer school does have a residential component, so they can assist with visas and there are on-campus and off-campus housing opportunities. For HES the best you can do is search the off campus opportunities on their web site. For what it\u2019s worth, the cheapest lodging within walking distance of Harvard is Irving House. It\u2019s about ten minutes walk to campus. Their cheapest room is what looks like a tiny single with a shared bath for $165 a night. Decent for a weekend. Probably cost prohibitive for a month. But Harvard Yard is right on the MTBA line, so you could stay anywhere close to a station and have less than a 30 minute commute.",

I started browsing for convocation weekend and shit is *expensive.* I saw a Holiday Inn Express not far from campus for nearly $500/night \ud83d\udc80\n\nA trick I've used in the past is also to call a hotel directly and get a manager on the phone. Tell them you're looking for an extended stay and was looking into what sort of discount they could offer. Most hotels will jump at the chance to secure a single room being booked for weeks on end and many will wheel and deal.",

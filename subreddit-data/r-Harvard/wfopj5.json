As for \"major changes\" (putting it in quotes here for a reason), they used to be representatives for each freshmen yard and each upperclassmen dorm, but those were replaced by officers relating to certain aspects of the university (e.g I think now the job titles are like an academic officer, social life officer, activities officer, etc.).",

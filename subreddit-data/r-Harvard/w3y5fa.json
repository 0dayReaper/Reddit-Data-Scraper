    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m an incoming freshman and when I think about all the resources available at Harvard it can be super daunting. I know it\u2019s implausible to utilize all of them in a span of four years, but I was wondering whether there are any less known resources you regret not taking advantage of or wish you had found out about earlier. Thank you!",

It\u2019s also a great resource for getting to see a lot the cool historical stuff around Boston without spending an arm and a leg. \n\nMake sure you don\u2019t focus solely on Harvard resources - check out other things as well. Off the top of my head, there are 50+ free outdoor movies and several free outdoor exercise classes around the Boston area through sometime in September. \n\n[https://outingsandinnings.harvard.edu/](https://outingsandinnings.harvard.edu/)",

You can also get free access to the Washington Post. There are a number of free softwares you can get on your personal computer through HUIT.\n\nFree admission to museum of fine arts in Boston, not to mention all of the Harvard museums on campus. You can also probably arrange to visit the museum archives if you take the right class or meet the museum staff.\n\nIf you are creative, you can usually find a way to get funding for any sort of project you want to work on including term time work or research or summer work or traveling. You can also work towards applying for a fellowship when you graduate which could give you funding to travel or do research. Funding for projects is not that hard to find if you seek it out.",

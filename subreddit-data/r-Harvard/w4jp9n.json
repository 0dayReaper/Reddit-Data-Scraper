    "postText": "Hey everyone? Im interested in taking a cs class this upcoming year and while I was planning on taking cs 50, I saw in a thread someone suggested to actually take cs 1. Both say they are for people with little or no coding experience so was just wondering what you guys think about both courses and any advice on which one to take?",

It's a challenging course (especially for beginners), but it'll be rewarding in terms of the material you learn. Plus, you can always take CS50 pass-fail and the grading is fairly lenient.",

Lots of people take CS50 with no/little experience and it really is a good intro class.\n\nCS1 seems to be taken by people who want to learn a bit of coding but aren\u2019t too interested in CS. It also seems to have a bit of an ethics/privacy spin. Read the Q guide too to see past students\u2019 comments.",

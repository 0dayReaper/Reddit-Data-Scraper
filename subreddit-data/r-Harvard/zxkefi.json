But once one gets over that\u2026.My favorite thing is how the College really feels like a small liberal arts school attached to an amazing R1. Almost every person I\u2019ve met working at the College with students really loves students and their work. It\u2019s an amazing wonderful place and Cambridge is the best of both a city and a suburb\u2014lots of trees everywhere, so many interesting, diverse people, an amazing food scene\u2026.\n\nCongrats on your acceptance and I hope that you come to love Harvard College and Cambridge as much as I do!",

Not that Harvard is easy, but coming here dispels the mystical nature of the place to an extent. That professor whose research you idolized is just a human just like everyone else. They are brilliant, but there comes a point where even an amazing class is just a class.\n\nThe opportunities are also plentiful. As long as you put yourself out there, you will find some way to either find or create a hands-on learning experience to apply the skills you\u2019re learning during your studies. Many schools have limited resources to provide such opportunities, and those limitations also can come in the form of available support even if you have the initiative to create an opportunity for yourself. Even so, you still have to work to take advantage of those opportunities no matter where you go. It\u2019s just that your hard work probably goes farther at Harvard.\n\nMost of all though, Harvard has been a great experience because a place like this attracts many incredibly bright people (and I\u2019d be lying if I said their brilliant marketing didn\u2019t have anything to do with it). Those people and the connections you will make with them are what make this place what it is. There is nothing quite like being able to have a deep conversation over a mutual passion. Throughout my undergrad and even as a working professional, those kinds of connections were harder to come by, but they have been much more common at Harvard. Furthermore, usually the best I could hope for was someone to talk ideas with. At Harvard, we talk about plans instead.\n\nThat being said, my experience as a graduate student may differ from yours as an undergrad. I hear that undergrads at Harvard often struggle with a culture of competition, and the first few years of college will also a major adjustment no matter what school you go to. High school was probably a completely different ball game and I won\u2019t sugar coat things: many people REALLY struggle (and it\u2019s okay to struggle!) in one way or another. It might not happen for you right away, but there will come a point where you\u2019ll stop feeling threatened by the impressiveness of your fellow classmates and instead feel inspired by it. Give it time and self reflection, and eventually you will be able to bask in that sense of wonder and appreciate each other to form connections instead of rivalries. Not everyone will be pleasant to interact with and not everyone will be friend material, but when you find your people (and you only need a handful) the world is your oyster.\n\nCongratulations and welcome to Harvard!",

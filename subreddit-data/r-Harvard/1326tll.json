    "postText": "I am an admitted student to HSPH for the fall. I have been trying to find housing for my family for over two months on the open market and it\u2019s brutal as I\u2019m sure everyone is aware. Absolutely nobody wants to rent to a family.   At this point I\u2019m just praying that HUH will be an option. I spoke to somebody today and it sounds like approved applicants with a family get their view and select day on the first available day, which gives a pretty good shot at securing housing. I\u2019ve heard from some people though that the housing is terrible. I\u2019m just trying to weigh the options at this point because to continue to search on the open market is exhausting and quite frankly just really sucks to get rejected over and over again.  I have school age kids so we need excellent schools and prefer Cambridge over Boston.  Anyone living in HUH with kids in elementary or middle school? Any thoughts or advice on securing housing?",

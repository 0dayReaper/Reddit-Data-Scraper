    "postText": "Hi, \n\nI'm a rising junior with a few questions about the AB/SM program. On the Harvard website, it says that assuming you are admitted to the program, you must complete at least 4 extra courses beyond the requirements of the AB degree (since the SM degree comprises 8 courses, and Harvard allows you to double-count four courses for the AB and SM). \n\nIn terms of courses you can double-count, can these be any course that goes towards the AB degree? Or, are these courses still beholden to the restriction that at most 3 out of the 8 courses in the SM degree may be 100-level courses? \n\nNow, also wanted to clarify my math in terms of the requirements for the degree, assuming that the latter holds. In terms of courses I've taken so far over the last 2 semesters, I took 21B and Stat 110, so I've filled the 2 courses needed for mathematical preparation. In terms of the CS reqs, I've done Programming 1 and 2, Formal Reasoning, and Computation in the World Tags, which gives me 6 CS courses in total, so I believe I need to do systems (I'm taking CS161 in the fall) and 2 more 100+ level CS classes for the AB. \n\nOverall, I'm planning to take at least 2 CS classes each semester for my remaining two years, so suppose at a minimum I have 7 classes to work with (aside from 61). To get the AB/SM, suppose I count two of my 100-level courses towards both. Next year, I take 61 + three 200-level courses. This fulfills all the reqs for my AB, and then (if my math is correct), I have 4 courses to complete for the SM in my senior year (with 2 counting for each semester). \n\nAm I understanding the requirements for the AB/SM program correctly?",

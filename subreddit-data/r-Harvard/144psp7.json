    "postText": "honestly everyday im torn when i think about how ill be paying 40K to get a masters in education. dont get me wrong i love learning and i am passionate about the topic, but to give up my full time job, go into debt, and jobs search again in 9 months is bonkers in these times. what has been everyone elses experiences after harvard? was it worth it? (im first-gen low income so dont come for me and tell me how special harvard is, i of all people know im so lucky). ",

            "comment": "For context, my wife is a classroom teacher and got into HGSE for the Masters program (she did not attend but only because she ended up going somewhere else closer to where we lived at the time).\n\nI think it could make a big difference whether you want to be an in-classroom teacher for your career or whether you want to go into admin, curriculum, policy, etc. From a classroom perspective you may not make much more money, but you may have more choices in schools you could get a job to teach at. Also, the younger you are, the longer you have to pay it off, so even if your state offers something paltry like $1500/yr extra for having a masters, you can in theory pay it off over time though if you need debt to attend HGSE that may be entirely offset my interest on the loans.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to switch from the classroom to another part of the ed sector, a masters could be an extremely helpful step for shortcutting that process. My wife wants to get into curriculum (and honestly we could afford it) so for her it would be an easy choice to go, especially considering the excitement of being part of the Harvard community.\n\nI hope this helps, even if just a little bit. I would really underline the lost income in that year as a cost that people sometimes overlook or underappreciate, but I wouldn\u2019t worry *at all* about the job search at the end of the year\u2026 you will have a degree from Harvard and the help of their career services, which is significant. Good luck with your decision!",

            "comment": "Not an HGSE alum, but my mom worked in teacher certification policy until quite recently, and her refrain is that there's basically no reason not to go to a state school unless you're specifically looking to teach at a top-tier private school. You'll save money, the career pipeline is usually just as good, and the quality isn't markedly different. \n\nI went to a public school. I had teachers that went to HGSE, but most of my teachers went to state colleges or local commuter schools. There was no correlation between credential and quality, because teaching is something you can only get good at by doing. One of the best teachers I ever had did her masters while teaching classes in a prison.",

I took a job earning more than $40k more than I had been making before the degree and the degree definitely helped landing that job. This money multiplied over my career makes it a very easy return on investment but usage may vary.",

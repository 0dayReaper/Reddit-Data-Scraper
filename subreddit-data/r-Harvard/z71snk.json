A quick perusal of your comment history shows you trawling through people's profiles to harass them from here leaving snark on all their comments in unrelated videogame subreddits.\n\nYour \"be better\" schtick you're dropping is you implying you're being better and looking down on them, but it's kind of transparent, creepy and cringe as hell especially in the context of your actual behavior. We all know that overcompensating guy, and that guy ends up lonely as hell.  \nBe the butter and muffin the cringe behavior.\n\n**Edit:** Oh no, ChasingHorizon's edited their profile and blocked me.

I'm currently trying to plan out my freshman spring schedule and was wondering if LS1b has changed its schedule from Tues/Thurs to Mon/Wed/Fri, as that is what it says on my.harvard. I was kinda confused because in all the previous years, it was consistently a Tues/Thurs schedule similar tot LS1a.",

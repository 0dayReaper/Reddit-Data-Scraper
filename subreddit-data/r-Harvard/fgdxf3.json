    "postText": "By now I'm sure you're all aware that classes after spring break will be held virtually. \"But HarvardDating, how will I flex as hard digitally as I do on campus?\" It's a troubling question. Through the eyes of a webcam your classmates won't know you're wearing Yeezys, and won't be able to see you carry your Boosted Board into class. It's a troubling issue, now you'll be restricted to the small view your webcam allows in order to show everyone how much better than them you are. Luckily, there are some solutions for this conundrum that will allow you to continue to flex in your virtual classes.\n\n* Headphones\n\nSince people will only be able to see your upper body, headphones are the obvious go-to. Your Bose or Sony's won't cut it anymore, you need something that displays your true status. My recommendation is the [Sennheiser Orpheus.](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/sennheiser-he-1) Coming in at just shy of $60,000 they serve as a good starting point for displaying your wealth and status. The disadvantage is that you won't be able to claim you missed hearing something in class, forcing you to actually pay attention for once, but it's a small price to pay for the amount of drip they come with.\n\n* Your background\n\nThe concrete walls of your parent's basement where they're quarantining you until all your filthy Boston germs are gone isn't sufficient. Hopefully you've beat the rush and already reserved the [AirBnB penthouse in Manhattan](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/33279205?location=Manhattan%2C%20New%20York%2C%20NY&amp;adults=1&amp;check_in=2020-04-22&amp;check_out=2020-04-30&amp;source_impression_id=p3_1583846555_GQPQOEZl0kOpVvF4) you're staying at until your summer internship starts. Robot concierge included to prevent infection. Sitting by the window for your classes here reminds everyone that it's worth paying over $1,000 per night for the luxury of not having to be around the sickly. A way to increase your flex is to step away from class halfway through to grab the Peking duck you ordered from Seamless for lunch. Just make sure the driver leaves it at the door so you don't have to see them, let alone talk to them.\n\n* Jewelry\n\nSince your neck will be in view, it's only logical that you show off some ice. This [diamond-studded white gold Cuban chain](https://www.avianneandco.com/collections/diamond-cuban-chain/products/14k-solid-white-gold-mens-diamond-cuban-chain-20-00-ctw) will glisten in the light that comes in through the windows of your penthouse, overexposing your webcam with light so that your classmates will have no choice but to notice it. A bonus is getting a custom Harvard piece commemorating the occasion, which shouldn't take too long to produce if you already have a jeweler on retainer.\n\nThere are many other subtle ways to remind your classmates of your superiority during this transition to virtual classes, but I hope this serves as a good starting point for those of you unsure of where to start due to the sudden shift to distance education. **Most importantly,** make sure to remind any Extension students you might come into contact with that your virtual classes are more legitimate and educational than theirs. They should know this already, but a gentle reminder never hurts.\n\nGood luck and good health to you all. I'll see online you from my island in the Maldives that I'll be avoiding the rest of you from. Make sure to wash your hands before you eat those McChickens, and only cough on the Yalies.",

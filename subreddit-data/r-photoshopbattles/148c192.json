That is 225.8 million requests per day or 9.4 million requests per hour or 156,810 queries per minute.  \n  \nQuoting the top stickies post on /r/apolloapp \n&gt; The price they gave was $0.24 for 1,000 API calls. I quickly inputted this in my app, and saw that it was not far off Twitter\u2019s outstandingly high API prices, at $12,000, and with my current usage would cost almost $2 million dollars per month, or over $20 million per year. That is not an exaggeration, that is just multiplying the 7 billion requests Apollo made last month by the price per request. Could I potentially get that number down? Absolutely given some time, but it\u2019s illustrative of the large cost that Apollo would be charged.",

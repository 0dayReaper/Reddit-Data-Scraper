You need to shoot at a very fast shutter speed to get the bird sharp, motion blur is a result of slow shutter speeds on moving subjects.\n\n*Edit: correction, it is possible using rear curtain sync with your flash. But I don't think it was used here, as the wings aren't blurred, just the butt.\n\nThough others have pointed out that the blur is not in the water, but I do see traces of it there.\n\nSo maybe it could be real, with some of the exposure tweaked in post. Honestly though, that's one way to make an extremely difficult shot just that much harder, especially when you can just add it in post.",

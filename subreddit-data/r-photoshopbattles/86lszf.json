The purpose of protection is to soften the concussive sound waves that damage the fine hairs of the ear drum. \n\nAccording to LEOs, you are correct. They train them with no hearing protection because that's what they hear in the field. In some situations, such as when operating flash bangs, it's recommended that the handler cover the ears of their canine companion. The dogs may suffer from some hearing loss, but that's likely the price to pay for a well trained animal that can operate in realistic scenarios. \n\nhttps://www.officer.com/on-the-street/k-9-equipment-services/article/10985424/canines-and-gunfire",

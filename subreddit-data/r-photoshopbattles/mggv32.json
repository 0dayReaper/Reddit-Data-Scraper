In the original picture you can faintly see the reflection of the person taking the picture in the surface of the table, and this edit is meant to replace that reflection.\n\n It creates a new scenario for the viewer: first you see this goofy, bizarre scene of this guy being bamboozled like a chump with an iPhone coffee table, but then you say *\"wait a second, what the fuck is that in the reflection?\"*\n\nYou squint and strain your eyes until suddenly you realize this stupid son of a bitch with his iPhone table is the *least* interesting thing happening here, as Big Bird is holding a firearm just across from him. \n\nI hope this clarified things, thank you for coming with me on this journey.",

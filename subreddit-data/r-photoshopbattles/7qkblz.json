I've never actually had a iguana shipped to me, but I've had various other reptiles shipped to me. \nFirst, they'll only ship them to you in weather that wont affect the lizard. Like some breeders won't ship if it's too cold. \nSecond, They'll pad the boxes so the lizards won't like bounce around in there or whatever\nThird, they'll put these little \"cubes\" in there that is used a water supply for the lizard. They'll also put a good amount of paper towels in case the lizard takes a big ol shit in there.\nFourth, 1 day shipping that needs a signature (so if no one is there to retrieve the package the lizard won't just be outside stuck in the box, It'll go back to the post office)\nOf course i don't doubt that there are shitty people that just ship animals in a way to maximize profit and don't care about the animals at all.",

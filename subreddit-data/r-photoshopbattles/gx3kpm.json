There has certainly been a population boom in some capacity. They used to be pretty uncommon, and seeing one with a baby used to be like seeing a unicorn, now I see probably 3 or 4 of em every time i got out on my boat, and i\u2019d say one in every 15 or 20 has a baby with em. If you\u2019re not in immediate eyeshot of a wildlife officer, they love a gentle pet on the head, and will actually start to play games with you, like doing barrel rolls and such. And even if one does see you, it\u2019s basically a verbal warning anymore if you weren\u2019t doing anything visibly malicious.\n\nAnd yes, whatever you\u2019re thinking a baby manatee looks like, they are *that* cute.

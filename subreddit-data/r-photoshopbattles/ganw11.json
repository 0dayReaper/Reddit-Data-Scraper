I don't use Photoshop, but I will list out my steps which should be translatable to whatever software.\nPoster used as base for image (https://i.imgur.com/Loi0RAy.jpg)\n\n-----\n\n1) cutout Danny, and paste over machete, USM sharpen low radius, bring out details, slight s-curve, some dodge/burn to adjust lighting to match, and colour adjustments to match the vintage yellow tint to the poster\n2) Clone out machete's machete and Rodriguez rifle using some chunks from background\n3) add switches to all parties, some adjustment of fingers to help them hold on to the hardware. \n4) clone out all remaining weapons using clonestamp and nearby bits and bobs\n5) replace title with title of your choice, used Aachen bold font(Google searched machete font), made a 3d font downward perspective, overlay some background texture.\n6) this step is mostly just spamming filters until happy, but basically - oil filter overlay set to lighten to smooth and slick up things. HDR filter to pop the colour and details, and lots of obsessive adjustments to highlight/shadows/ambience/saturation etc until I felt it looked nice.\n\nThat's it, hope that helps, next time I will try to screenshot along the way.",

American Kestrels are colloquially called sparrow-hawks sometimes. And Kestrels are actually falcons, unlike the pictured bird here. Falcon's are actually more closely related to parrots than to hawks.",

Also Kestrel's predate much more heavily on smaller rodents like mice, voles etc, hence the hovering to find these creatures. A Sparrowhawk hunts smaller birds on the wing chasing them through the air.  In the right areas you'll sometimes see a SH taking something down on your back garden. They're specatularly agile hunters.",

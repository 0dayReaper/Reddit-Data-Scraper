This loss will affect a significant portion of /r/photoshopbattles' mod team, our creators, and our subscribers.\n\nSo our community is joining the protest, and calling for a solution that will allow these 3rd party apps to survive.\n\n&amp;#0160;\n\n**Effective immediately: Only submissions of [blank black images](https://i.imgur.com/TtfG07H.jpg) will be approved.**\n\nOur comment sections will remain open, so that photoshoppers can creatively express their opinions about the situation.",

Unfortunately /r/photoshopbattles doesn't get the number of visitors it once did; and if we shut down, not many people would notice.\n\nBut what we do have are a lot of talented creators, and an enormous latent userbase that [has shown itself willing to come alive and make noise on this issue.](https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/1461hls/psbattle_steve_spez_huffman_ceo_of_reddit/) Leveraging this unique position of our community is the most effective thing we can do to contribute.\n\n&amp;#0160;\n\n*Edit: If you would like to participate, feel free to submit a blank black image of any size; but the title must be boring and describe the image itself (e.g. `PsBattle: A dark rectangle` or `PsBattle: Blank image`). The intention behind allowing only blank images is so that we don't generate submission content; and by the same spirit, titles shouldn't be content either.*",

I\u2019m a moderator, not a fortune teller.\n\nWe have no plans to relocate or replace PsB. The only question is, how much will PsB deteriorate and will there be enough redditors to keep the battles going.\n\nI\u2019ll be going with Apollo in any case, so none of this really concerns me much longer.

The API allowedore than just the 3rd party mobile apps to work, it's also fundamental for bots, we're not talking just novelty bots like haiku bot, but also moderation tool bots, and accessibility bots that help hard of sight users to use the site. This isn't exhaustive either.\n\nSo a few days ago Reddit announced that they're increasing the API costs to use it, by a lot. Some high user API apps have been quoted up to 20M for their use of the API after the change.\n\nThey are grossly overvaluing the cost of API calls, likely spurred on by Elon Musk doing a similar thing over on Twitter. All this is essentially to inflate the value of the platform for their IPO when they go public so they can finally cash out.\n\nThen Spez, the CEO of Reddit did an AmA, and didn't really answer anything, but did act like an ass.\n\nReddit has a history of going dark to protest actions by the leadership of the site, with varying success, so they're doing it again.",

I indeed used to use the website exclusively, but as years went by, so changed my real-life surroundings, which eventually led to my Reddit usage evolving over time to very very different situations compared to what it was a decade ago. For years and years I have no longer taken time to *specifically use Reddit* but instead, nowadays I use Reddit while waiting one thing or another to happen. I never use it on a computer anymore, I\u2019m always on mobile, and have been for a very long time.\n\nAs for the API fees, asking 3rd party app to pay API fee of multiple times that of what the app generates, is just a dick move. This is no mistake, because Reddit killed not one, but all the 3rd party apps, and when they heard that\u2019s going to happen, they said they will do it anyway.\n\nI mean sure Reddit can do whatever they want, but as I don\u2019t work here, so can I. So what I\u2019m going to do is stop doing all of what I was doing 12.5 years as a contributor and a moderator. I suppose Reddit is happy enough with me gone, hey at least there\u2019s one less whining freeloader to worry about.",

As someone working in software industry, I think I have pretty good grasp on what a complete and utter bullshit reddit is pulling here.\n\nThe web experience in mobile is quite bad compared to what some 3rd party apps provide. Perhaps you wish to try out a few different apps before making bold claims about them. Objective platform capabilities don\u2019t give a rats ass about your struggles to understand these things.",

To be fair to you, the official app is seriously broken at the moment. Maybe they're taking advantage of a lot of users saying they're breaking for a few days to try to implement certain changes.\n\n You know nothing about me - I get your frustration dealing with having to drop your favorite way of browsing reddit or leave it entirely, but chill with making it personal. This is such a nothing issue, not worth being an ass to me over.",

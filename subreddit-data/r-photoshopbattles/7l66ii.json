If you did, it is so much easier to make a selection with the lasso tool and then fill that with black or white when you have your mask selected. That way it is much easier to get clean straight lines. You could also feather the selection a bit if you wanted. \n\nHope that helps / made sense!",

I put the photoshopped cat layer on the background and reduced the opacity of the cat. Then I erased the parts covering the bars. Then I reset the opacity to normal. This is pretty new to me. This sub encouraged me to try new things so I bought Photoshop 3 days ago. Thanks man you have helped more than you think.",

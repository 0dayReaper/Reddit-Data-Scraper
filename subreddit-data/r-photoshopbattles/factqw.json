For this one, the text looked a lot like Arial and since it was NASA, I couldn't imagine they would use anything too fancy. So I started from there and it seems like the font was Arial Black. Then I took my text and edited it using the Character and Paragraph palettes which let you control how close and far away both characters and individual lines are. I also did a very slight amount of warping because the paper is bent, so just tilting the text in one direction or another didn't achieve the effect I wanted. \n\nOnce I had it pretty much lined up, I then typed my own text over what was there, clone stamped out the original text, re-clone stamped in a lot of JPEG compression to make it look authentic, applied a very slight blur and was done.",

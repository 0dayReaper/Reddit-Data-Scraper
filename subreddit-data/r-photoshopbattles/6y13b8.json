The cormorants of the ends of his pole are trained to catch fish for him. The fisherman rig a line or something around the neck of the bird so it can't swallow the fish completely. After the birds have a catch, they are trained so well and I don't how but they return to the boat to spit up their food for the fisherman. This is in China. I've watched part of the Wild China documentary on Netflix and they have a very cool segment about this. They train the birds for a very long time and take care of them. ",

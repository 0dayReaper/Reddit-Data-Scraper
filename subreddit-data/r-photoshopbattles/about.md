Rules:

Subjective Title: * Titles should objectively describe what's visible in the image.

 Non-descriptive titles, such as `this has potential`, `what is he doing?`, `make this epic` or `this cat/dog/baby` are no longer permitted.

* Please avoid:
 * Making jokes
 * Giving suggestions
 * Contextualizing, or giving background info
 * Sharing personal anecdotes
 * [Mentioning your connection to the image](https://np.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/2xcj5q/my_blind_husband_juggling_our_rescue_dog_cat_and)

Request: Please do not post requests on /r/photoshopbattles.

Submissions seeking specific modifications, such as `please touch-up this photo`, can be posted to /r/picrequests or /r/photoshoprequest.

Bad Link: * Image links must be in the form of a single, static image.

 GIFs, albums, and tiled images are not permitted.

* The URL posted should be a direct link to an image file; i.e. it must end in `.jpg` or `.png`

 With Imgur:

 http://imgur.com/R9j1gvQ is an HTML webpage containing an image.

Submission Deleted: Please do not delete your thread if there are any photoshops on it. If there are and you feel you must, please [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fphotoshopbattles) first. If it is found that you are deleting threads with photoshops to maximize karma or without good reason, you will have your posting ability revoked. This subreddit is first and foremost a platform for photoshoppers to create their work and be seen, please do not impede this.

NSFW: NSFW tags must be used generously.

Sexually suggestive or gore-y images may also be removed at the discretion of the mod team.

Junk / Off Topic: Junk comments distract from this subreddit a lot more than in other subreddits that are not based on original content.

Top Level Comment Without Original Photoshop: Top-level comments must contain an original photoshop.

If you entered but didn't get one, just [send the mods a message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fphotoshopbattles), and we'll fix you up.\n\n* Winners can enter Weeklies for which they have submitted the stock image, but they will not be eligible to win.\n\n* Please be sure to tag NSFW entries appropriately.\n\n If you see anything inappropriate that's not tagged, either report the comment or [send a message to the moderators.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fphotoshopbattles)\n\n&amp;#0160;\n\n###The Schedule\n\n* **All entries will be hidden for the first 48 hours.**\n\n* Voting will open on Tuesday, after which all entries will be visible.\n\n [Contest mode](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof2012/comments/159bww/introducing_contest_mode_a_tool_for_your_voting/) will be enabled for another 24 hours. This will sort comments randomly, obscure vote counts, and automatically minimize child comments.\n\n* Contest mode will be disabled on Wednesday.\n\n From there on out, each comment's vote total will be visible, and entries can be sorted by karma (just like any other Reddit thread).\n\n* **The Battle will end on Saturday, June 3^(rd).**\n\n Next week's battle will be posted early Sunday morning.\n\n&amp;#0160;\n\nBest of luck, everyone; have fun!",

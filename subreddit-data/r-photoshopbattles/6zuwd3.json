IIRC she was supposed to orbit the earth a couple of times and her last meal was supposed to poison her and there was no re-entry plan.",

She was also strapped down and the cabin was tiny, which certainly hastened the process. If that hadn't happened she would've lived possibly for six days since that was how long the on-board oxygen lasted, and she had enough food in the form of gelatinized meat that was regularly dispensed and she was trained to accept that diet while on Earth. Soviet Russia actually did claim that she lived for 6 days and the real information only became public after their collapse. ",

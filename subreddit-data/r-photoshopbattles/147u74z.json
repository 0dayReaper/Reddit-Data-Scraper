After the break dance movie Breakin' 2 came out (and bombed) \"Electric Boogaloo\" was adopted and kept alive as a term for a sequel nobody asked for. At least, up until it became recent slang for a Far Right 2nd Civil War (lol) in the last few years here in the US, which makes it an absolutely hilarious joke.",

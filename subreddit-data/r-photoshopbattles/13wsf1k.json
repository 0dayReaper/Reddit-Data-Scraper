It protects what is in the helmet being your skull and face. The outside crumple zones of your car don't protect you if you aren't wearing your seat belt. The seat belt does that. You don't have a seat belt for your brain.\n\nEdit: Also to add, If a helmet prevented concussions and brain damage, why do so many NFL players have CTE? CTE doesn't even happen because of concussions. Just the softer, subconcussive hits that they endure most plays. A helmet doesn't even protect from that. \n\nIt's theorized that helmets/face masks have made the game deadlier long term because people feel invincible with this armor on them.",

On your second win, you'll get [this winners' flair](http://i.imgur.com/yjrg5S4.png), etc.\n\n* Get to keep the [trophy](http://i.imgur.com/Zd7BGXX.png) for a week, after which it's handed on to the next winner.\n\n (more information on flair [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/17qz8z/flair_overhaul/))\n\n&amp;#0160;\n\n###The Rules\n\n* Submit your entry as a comment to this thread.\n\n You can post as many as you want.\n\n* To vote for an entry, just upvote the users comment.\n\n You can vote for as many different entries as you want, but please **do not downvote.** Downvotes will not be counted when deciding winners.\n\n* Every entrant gets a [contributor flair.](http://i.imgur.com/g9Lf3Cb.png)\n\n These will be handed out by a bot, but due to our comment hiding system, sometimes it misses people. If you entered but didn't get one, just [send the mods a message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fphotoshopbattles), and we'll fix you up.\n\n* Winners can enter Weeklies for which they have submitted the stock image, but they will not be eligible to win.\n\n* Please be sure to tag NSFW entries appropriately.\n\n If you see anything inappropriate that's not tagged, either report the comment or [send a message to the moderators.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fphotoshopbattles)\n\n&amp;#0160;\n\n###The Schedule\n\n* **All entries will be hidden for the first 48 hours.**\n\n* Voting will open on Tuesday, after which all entries will be visible.\n\n [Contest mode](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof2012/comments/159bww/introducing_contest_mode_a_tool_for_your_voting/) will be enabled for another 24 hours. This will sort comments randomly, obscure vote counts, and automatically minimize child comments.\n\n* Contest mode will be disabled on Wednesday.\n\n From there on out, each comment's vote total will be visible, and entries can be sorted by karma (just like any other Reddit thread).\n\n* **The Battle will end on Saturday, June 10^(th).**\n\n Next week's battle will be posted early Sunday morning.\n\n&amp;#0160;\n\nBest of luck, everyone; have fun!",

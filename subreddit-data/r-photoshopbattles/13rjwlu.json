This is a tutorial I made a while back (originally for an exploitative site that I think people should avoid called \"hitrecord\"), explaining the basics of my animation process:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/y2h0wLYe6PM\n\nSome of it's out of date (especially the site-specific stuff) but those are the basics. I know a small handful of tricks that I use in different ways to create all sorts of animations. There are definitely better and more in-depth tutorials on YouTube that you can find to do just about anything you can imagine.\n\nThe Photoshop Battles subreddit also has a tutorial page full of basics for picture editing, including After Effects:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/wiki/tutorials",

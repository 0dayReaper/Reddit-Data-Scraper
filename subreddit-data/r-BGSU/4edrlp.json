    "postText": "Hello, finally got my funding from my grad program. Scholarship for tuition, and a stipend of 10,000. I still need to pay for the student health insurance.\n\nI'm prepared to live modestly, I don't need much, but is this even possible? I'm currently in California, so my cost of living is distorted.

            "comment": "My stipend is considerably more than that (~15k/yr), It's pretty comfortable with no expensive hobbies or habits other than frequent takeout/restaurant patronage.\n\nI would say it's definitely doable if you are frugal with food and entertainment.\n\nThere are several graduate housing options for less than $400 a month rent and less than $100 utilities which would be well under your budget (~$830/month). You'll be surprised how cheap housing is. I currently spend less than $400 a month with one roommate. \n\nMight find even cheaper if you're willing to have a few roommates. However you may end up out of walking distance from campus.\n\nGood grocery stores in town. There's a Kroger (good reward program) and Aldi (cheap).\n\nFurniture can be had pretty easily. There are of course many garage sales in the summer, some of which have reasonable prices. Goodwill has an entire store for just used furniture. It's of generally good quality and reasonable price.\n\nA few expenses you may not consider when budgeting:\n\nMost graduate departments don't pay the general fee which is pretty hefty. Ask your grad director about that.\n\nOut of state tuition may or may not be covered by your scholarship.\n\nYou already know about insurance.\n\nParking pass is $100. Walking is free.\n\nUnfortunately Time Warner cable is the only show in town so they gouge ISP prices a little. Negotiate for a good promotional price.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you have specific questions about cost of living.",

Also, my program didn't cover all of my tuition, so that is another thing, but even if they had, there is no way I could afford to live here on that stipend. (My expenses outside of the everyday things are a $200/month car payment).",

Most assistantships count for somewhere around 15 hours. BGSU limits you to 28 hours total per week. \n\nThere are plenty of jobs that have off hours that need covered. ",

I was just talking to someone in the program currently who also has an outside job for 25-30 hours a week and she seems to handle it fine.\n\nThe 28 hours per week, is that for all jobs on campus? I'd take a job off campus too, anywhere really, if I can make this work. This week I was prepared to pass it over, thinking it was dumb to try to live on that, but now my heart says this is something I shouldn't pass up.\n\n",

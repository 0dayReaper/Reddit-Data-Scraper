    "postText": "If any of you out there are grad students in the music department, I would appreciate your help on this matter, and even if you're not a music student, your input could be helpful too.\n\nI'm currently about to complete my first year in a master's program in North Dakota, though I've felt increasingly dissatisfied with my experience so far (e.g. lack of resources, poor treatment of grad assistants, lack of enriching instruction, etc.). Despite the shortcomings, my gig as a grad assistant here basically covers my tuition and fees (we break even with our stipends). I pursued BGSU on my girlfriend's recommendation and the reputation of music program for nurturing contemporary/new music which is perfect for our clarinet/percussion duo. I've been accepted to the CMA for Fall 2015 and offered a half-time tuition scholarship (which doesn't cover fees or insurance or anything) that I need to accept or decline by Monday (5/4).\n\nShould I quit my gig in North Dakota and head to BGSU despite the seeming financial quagmire that lays ahead of me? Is the music program worth essentially another two years of study? How do others feel about their experience? Is Bowling Green worth the move?\n\nAny advice and information would help.",

The faculty is outstanding on a personal and musical level, and there are a ton of performance opportunities. It's not the most...cultured area, but the cost of living is low and you're close enough to Toledo, Columbus, and Cleveland to make a trip if you're getting tired of the small town stuff. Plus you're coming from the Dakotas so maybe that won't be as big an issue. \n\n",

I was a trumpet major but I wanted to diversify, so I started taking lessons with Schupp and some of the doctoral students...ended up putting some percussion stuff on my degree recital. I was in the MuEd department, and I mostly just wanted to have some fun and get more familiar with the \"back\" of the rehearsal hall (BG only allocates half a semester for Perc Methods and I didn't feel like I learned enough)... I was never more than a mediocre percussionist, to be honest, but Schupp always treated me just like part of the studio. \n\nSchupp is a hell of a musician, and a wonderful repository of knowledge. He's fair, almost always smiling unless someone really deserves a bitching out, and he doesn't have an ego. He's had a rough few years between his and his wife's health but I swear that man would give you the shirt off his back without a moment's hesitation. \n\nIf you like, I can get you the emails or facebooks of some of the doctoral and masters guys I went to school with, if you'd prefer to hear from someone at your level.

I studied music performance and jazz studies under Dr. Schupp and while it was difficult and frustrating at times, it was a great experience. Many, if not all of my friends who came from the program are prospering in the field. \n\nIf you'd like, pm me and I can give you some names of some students who went through the program. Also, I'm still living in the area if you need a friendly contact.",

I've felt somewhat hesitant because of the financial situation but it seems worth it. I've scheduled a phone convo with Dr. Schupp later today so I will touch base with him personally about the program. His credentials are very impressive.",

I think in my 4.5 years of being in the trumpet studio we had maybe 4 or 5 masterclasses, and not all of them were even trumpet players. We had that many in a single year with the percussion studio.

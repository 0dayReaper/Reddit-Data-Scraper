It would be nice to figure this out so I can pay and what not before their is a deadline.\n\nIf their isn't one id be willing to setup a team with anyone that is also interested. Btw I am an incoming freshman.",

Depending on your major a lot of peeps will also play so ask around the different fraternity's and major specific clubs too. ",

    "postText": "I thought it was common sense that they would be, but looking at the evaluations on Canvas that are done through EvaluationKit, there is nothing stating that any of my course evaluations are anonymous. What brought this question up is that in a few of my friends' classes last semester the professors came in on the last few days appearing upset, and brought up specific criticisms that sounded like they may have been from an eval. Maybe they are anonomous but they can read them before exams? Or maybe those were coincidences.  Just figured I'd see if anyone here knew. ",

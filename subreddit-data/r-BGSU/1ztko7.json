Do want to work on or off campus or does it matter?\n4.  Are you willing to work late hours and weekends?\n5.  How much are you looking to take home a week?",

Campus offices hire a LOT over the summer to train for the fall, but it will be hard to get anyone to hire you knowing you will not be here in the fall.  Your best bet is going to be looking at something in food service or looking at Meijer or Walmart.  That being said, none of those places are going to be really interested if you only working mornings would be hard.  \n\nAnother thing to consider would be http://www.tmdinc.com/  They are on Gypsy Lane, which puts them at about a 12 block walk from Campus.  That being said, they hire anyone basically that can show up to work on time and follow instructions.  They pay fairly well too.  I had a friend get hired there in April and work through August getting paid about 11 dollars an hour.  They also gave him 35 hours a week because he wanted that many hours.  That would put you around 285 a week, so you clearly work few hours if you decided to.  Just be prepared to work 2nd or 3rd shift.",

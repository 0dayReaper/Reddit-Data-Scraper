I just submitted my general scholarship application as well as 3 others that were recommended. \n\nDoes anyone have a rough estimate of when I will be notified if I have received these awards or not? Thank you!",

My scholarship with a january deadline got back to me by late march after an interview, but another from the general sholarship didn\u2019t get back to me til april since it was due in march. Not hearing anything for a while is pretty common",

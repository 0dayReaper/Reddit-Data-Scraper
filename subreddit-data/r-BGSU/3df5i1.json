Given the bunch of apartment buildings on that block and the street's proximity to the school (like 2 blocks), my worry is that it gets pretty loud there. Is that the case or no?",

            "comment": "I'm a delivery driver, I drive all over the town and have worked all shifts from 10am-6am (not at once, but over time) weekdays and weekends. The worst it'll get is during sporting events at the stroh or in the stadium. There are no bars down there, nothing other than housing. \n\nThe Fox Run apartments (200 block on west side of the street) seem to be townies. If not townies, then definitely not loud freshmen.\n\nUniversity Apartments (200 block on the east side) are probably sophmore-senior level undergrad students.\n\nFurther down in the 300 block on the same side seems to be the worst place for parking, but I haven't heard much noise when I go there. No idea on the noise though. Can't imagine its too bad.\n\nFurther back in the burrwood and bent wood and all the freaking \"B-something Wood\" streets are the jocks. Thats just my impression, anyways. No idea to be sure.\n\nYour biggest issue is probably going to be some kind of generator or pump that makes alot of noise constantly. I always think my car is breaking when I drive through there before I realize its the pump thing.\n\nHope this helps!!",

            "comment": "It's not a bad place to live.  Many grad students (PhD students in my experience, but others as well) usually live on the town side of Enterprise St.  There's bunches of small bungalow type houses for rent in that area.  They're usually around $700-$900 a month, which isn't bad split a couple of ways.  They're much quieter then the apartments around campus and you don't have to worry about annoying neighbors sharing a wall.\n\nThere's a bunch of other places to rent as well if you look around the town side of Bowling Green.  Really, until you get out west of the Park, you're going to be close enough to ride/walk to campus or downtown.  The only issue with living town-side is that the campus shuttles don't service you at all.  They mostly stick between campus and where all the student housing is.",

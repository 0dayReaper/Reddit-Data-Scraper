    "postText": "Last year we did a few of these threads, with the idea of helping people share really unique or cool experiences in and around BG. This one is a little different though. BG is a great little town, but sometimes it can help to get your head out for a weekend. With that in mind,  what are your best single day trip ideas. To avoid this just becoming best vacation ideas, here are a couple ground rules:\n\n1. All trips must be by car.\n2. All trips must have an intro cost of no more than 250 dollars.\n3. If the trip requires an overnight stay, the cost of a hotel must be included in the 250.  ",

They have a really cool [tour](http://bellsbeer.com/visit/tours/), which really shows off their operation. The [restaurant](http://bellsbeer.com/eccentric-cafe/) they run down the street is also really good, and showcases a few beers they don't always ship.\n\nSecond, I would recommend [Great Lakes](http://www.greatlakesbrewing.com/home).  Again, cool [tour](http://www.greatlakesbrewing.com/brewery/around-the-brewery) and and great [pub](http://www.greatlakesbrewing.com/brewpub/around-the-brewpub) packaged close together with some unique beers only offered on site.  Also, the area of Cleveland where they are located has some great local markets and attractions.",

It's a 30 minute max drive south.\n\nThe toledo museum is always cool to go to and it's free.\n\nToledo walleye  are starting back up.\n\nThe lights before Christmas will be starting soon at the zoo.\n\nColumbus has tons of fun places to go to and great places to eat that you could do in a day.

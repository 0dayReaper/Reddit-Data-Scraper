    "postText": "Hi everyone! The title says it all, really, but I could use some help finding naturey spots in the surrounding area. \n\n1. The girl I'm seeing loves stars.. But I've noticed it's hard to spot them here. I'm more broadly interested in just some nice spots to sit together at after dark, too. \n2. She loves nature trails and the like. \n3. I love trail running .. And am also interested for this reason :). \n\nThanks in advance for your input!!! And, I'm more than happy to drive a ways out of town.",

Lots of flowers, local art work, zen garden, and a few Pokestops \ud83d\ude0a. \n\nFor more nature hikes try oak openings, it's a 25-30 minute drive maybe. Trails are a few miles long along a river. There's a small park and yummy ice cream place along the way for a treat",

You get to look through the big telescope on top the Physical Science building too! Check the message board just inside the building to the right of the planetarium dome for schedules, but they normally start around 10 PM the second week of classes. ",

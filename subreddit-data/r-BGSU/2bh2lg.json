We're always looking for new players, any experience level, 18 and over.\n\nWe've heard over the years that a lot of students on campus are totally unaware of the rink and the city park for that matter.\n\nAny questions feel free to ask.\n\nThanks!",

Guys from the Club Hockey team and believe it or not a couple guys that may play in the NFL(not a typo). Anyone is welcome, male or female. \n\nWe play Sunday nights from 4:30PM TO 9:30PM if anyone would like to watch a game.\n\nThanks",

I was searching google for pictures of the pizza/cheesy bread/everything else and now I'm filled with nostalgia. DC has absolutely no pizza like it. I just wanted to post some love for Myles (and Pollyeye's stuffed breadsticks, holy shit).",

If you ask for a \"half baked\" order of polleyes breadsticks they will make them and partially bake them and give them to you with instructions to bake them at home. If you've got a cooler and a craving you can take some home with you and make them there!",

It's fucking huge and will feed you for a week if you are broke, but its burnt on the outside and raw in the middle. Pisanellos is the way to go for local pie, but pollyeyes bread sticks take the cake.\n",

    "postText": "I'm starting grad school at BGSU in the fall and am relocating from the west coast. The falcon landing seems like a pretty good deal for a nice apartment thats fully furnished with all utilities included. The only thing is that I would be sharing it with another grad student I don't know. Has anyone lived at these apartments that would be willing to share their experience? Do you find your own apartment mate or is it selected by the complex? Does falcon landing do a good job of matching compatible apartment mates? ",

            "comment": "I lived there last year. It is way overpriced. You can find a place that is cheaper (utilities included) with/without a roommate. I ended up rooming with someone in my program. I didn't know him before moving in, but it worked out ok. Another guy in my program lived with a stranger and it seemed to be ok. It's quiet. Everyone is a grad student or professional, it's pretty serious, so that is a plus. We didn't have a good experience with the fees they charged us when moving out. They are really nitpicky. ",

Washington is already overrun with corporate lobbyists buying our politicians votes, so there is no way I want them to take more of my money. Do you really think universal healthcare is going to work when big pharma is already so buddy buddy with the government? The program would directly help certain companies. A lot like that marijuana bill that came through ohio last year but created a forced government mandated monopoly of weed growers. \n\nFix the corruption problems and maybe then we can talk about adding social programs.",

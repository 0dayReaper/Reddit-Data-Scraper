We don't have an iPad install movie, but we do have information on setting it up on this page under the OneDrive install guide:\n\nhttp://www.bgsu.edu/its/services/computer/personal/mobile-devices.html\n\nEdit:  You can install it on up to 5 devices, so both your iPad and your computer can be setup!",

Log into your email and check it out.  The link for Office that the guides shows after clicking Office 365 Settings &gt; Software will not be there if you are not a student yet.",

I dunno. I'll try it now and see what happens!\n\n**edit:** It's letting me install it. I guess I became a full-fledged student when I scheduled classes today, haha.",

    "postText": "I was just curious to see if anyone had any guidance on the timeline for hearing a decision about being admitted or not? \n\nI applied to the clinical psych PhD program back in August for the upcoming fall semester. I emailed the graduate office yesterday to see when I should be hearing back and they gave a blanket answer of it could possibly be 2-6 weeks after all materials have been submitted and to keep checking the status page. That wasn't helpful so here I am.",

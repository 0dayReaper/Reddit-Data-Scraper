    "postText": "Is anyone else having this problem? No matter what I do, I can't get on the internet in the Student Union with either my laptop or my smartphone. The former won't recognize any networks, and the latter uses my data plan when I want to be on the internet, and says that all the networks in the building are \"Out of Range\". And yet, when I walk around, I see people browsing canvas, going on Youtube, and doing homework. What's going on?",

Make sure you have signed in on the authorization page. Also too many people in the building could cause the Internet to be slow if you are able to connect. ",

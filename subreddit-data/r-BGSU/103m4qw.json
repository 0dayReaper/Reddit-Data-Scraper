The communal bathroom has its ups and downs but by far the market is the best thing imo. There\u2019s been weekdays where I just study and go down there to grab food. Especially when it\u2019s cold out you don\u2019t want to walk to the oak alone just for food",

I paid my housing app on the day it came out and all of my classes are science labs and i think i have one math left (because of college programs at my school) and I was really hoping on getting a dorm near my classes",

It\u2019s a dorm for all years but people dropped out since first semester so there\u2019s definitely a chance lol. Someone mentioned wind at the entrance, this is the only like major downside the wind is awful around this building",

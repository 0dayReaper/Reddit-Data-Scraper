    "postText": "Hey guys I'm currently looking for a roommate to move into my apartment with me. I'm a third year student here at BGSU,  I'm renting a two bedroom apartment with two baths. The apartment is very close to campus, and are about a 10 min walk from downtown. Rent would be around $300 and we would have to split the electric and internet bill. If you're interested let me know, and I'm sure we can find a way to get into contact with each other.",

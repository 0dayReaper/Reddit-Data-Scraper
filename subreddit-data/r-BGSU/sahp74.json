Not that I can help attract people here (I'm living in England!), but have you considered adding stuff to the sub's sidebar to help generate interest when people arrive?  (I'd have suggested 'sticky' posts but I always order by 'New' so I won't see them.)\n\nI frequent r/Browns and more recently subscribed to r/BGSUFB.  Though there's a substantial difference in traffic levels both have basic information which reduces the need to search through or scroll duplicate posts, e.g.:\n\n* Basic team information (maybe adding links to official sources would be more appropriate due to the sheer number of sports across the university?)\n\n* Current standings (probably links, same as above?)\n\n* An 'action' photo (the Browns is updated often.)\n\n* [How to watch or listen to the Falcons](https://www.reddit.com/r/BGSUFB/comments/sgeuwb/how_to_watchlisten_to_bgsu_football/) from off campus or out of state/country/planet ;)\n\nOf course people asking the same old questions isn't *necessarily* a bad thing once numbers grow; might it increase engagement and keep things fresh?  Dunno.",

            "comment": "I never had any major issues. Maintenance requests were handled pretty quickly, the square footage is hard to beat, and private bathrooms made it perfect for me. \n\nThe downsides are that heating can get a bit expensive in the winter (possibly due to insulation?) and I've heard that some people have issued getting their deposits back. Personally I find these pretty minor for what I consider to be the best apartment I lived in while in college, but that's my opinion.\n\nIf you have any more questions feel free to PM me and I'll be happy to answer them.

            "comment": "Old post but regardless of what you decide you'll be fine overall, as it's pretty limited options for 4 people. Basically got Cooper beech, falcon point the edge, or a random big house. \n\nCB Pros: big as fuck, the walls between houses are good, private bathrooms, a deck with a yard that is kind of yours, lots of parking, close to Meijer. Cons: far away from campus, heating bill in winter is huge, downstairs apartments get cold as fuck, party scene was lame, gym is terrible, they will nickel and dime you on deposit, noise isn't great between floors.\n\n\nSo biggest things, if you want a pool, not good, a good gym, not good, if you are cold, don't live down stairs, if you are a light sleeper, be up stairs.",

            "comment": "I really liked living in Bowling Green and going to BGSU.  Nice small town atmosphere, a strip of bars and clubs and lots of tasty food.  A little of something for everyone.  If you like Mediterranean food (gyros, shawarma, tabouli and the like), please go to South Side 6.  It's a little convenience store that sells mostly beer, cigarettes and some of the biggest darn gyros you'll ever see.  I've lived in some of the biggest cities in the country and I haven't found a gyro that compares to So and Amal's at SS6.  \n\nGreek life is big there, seemingly more prevalent than at other universities.  It wasn't my cup of tea but those I knew who were in a Greek club seemed to like it.\n\nThis might not be the most prudent advice, but don't take your studies *too* seriously (unless you have a scholarship with a GPA requirement).  Certainly, put the work in that will help you succeed, but you'll be graduating before you know it.  Enjoy this time to come of age and find folks you can spend time with while you prepare yourself for the professional world.\n\nDon't hold on too tightly to old friends that may also be attending BGSU.  Some of my closest friends and lots of others from my HS and hometown went to BGSU and I remained close with fewer than I thought I would.  You'll move on from some, others will move on from you.  Don't take it personally, it just happens.\n\n*Graduate*.  Despite the growing sentiment that a bachelor's isn't as valuable as it used to be, it's much better to have it than not.  Something considerably less valuable than a bachelor's is $20k in student loan debt that you racked up before dropping out at the end of year 2 or 3.  Graduate.  College can be easy for some and hard for others, but as long as you have a decent head on your shoulders you'll be ok.",

And I was telling my parents.\n\nMeanwhile, the friends I made at BG have made a difference in my life as I traveled the world, they've given me food, a couch to sleep on, a job to work at. \n\nStudying is important, but no one goes to Harvard to learn. College is about making connections.",

I'd really be excited to see them. \n\nLong shot, but I figured I'd just go ahead and ask. ",

It looked like there were quite a few more letters in other folders, but these were the only two in folder 4.\n\n",

Or, if you'd rather take someone on a date - tell me the restaurant and i'll hit you up with a gift cert. Thanks a lot. Just some of the back-story. I originally saw the context summary of these letters about 10 years ago and was kind of disturbed to hear there was a history of mental illness in the family. None of my relatives would really talk about it so I was left just wondering. \n\nThese letters don't provide a lot of context obviously. I guess they were duking it out over some inheritence or will execution. But, it's still amazing to see. To see handwriting from someone I'm directly related to - all the way from 1830's. It's kind of unreal. \n\nIt makes me realize that life is short. These types of arguments are a drop in the bucket. Life will move so fast, and as time moves on, just as fast.... my great great great grandson might have the same faint microscopic understanding of who I am. \n\nRather, the way that I love my son... and the hope that I can impart love and genoristy to him, to build his character into a good man -  will hopefully be my legacy that will echo into future generations - even in the likely event that no one remembers anything about me. \n\nThank you again - wholeheartedly, for taking time out of your day to provide a window into the past. \n\n-J.Fowl ",

    "postText": "hey! i was admitted to bgsu with a graphic design major, i\u2019m going to be an incoming freshman this fall.\n\ni\u2019m not sure what i want to do as a career, but am leaning more toward packaging design? should i still stick with graphic design or switch my major to visual communication technology? i didn\u2019t know the university offered vct until last week, and the program sounds appealing. \n\ni\u2019m still trying to decide between university of cincinnati\u2019s communication design and bgsu. the vct program is seems similar to cincinnati\u2019s communication design\u2026 however i\u2019m not sure what to choose.\n\ni\u2019ve also heard about the deciding student program\u2026 would it be beneficial to come undecided and spend a semester choosing between the two majors, or should i pick one, see if i like it, then go from there?",

            "comment": "VCT 2015 grad here. It\u2019s a tough decision. And it depends if you want to lean more artistic in your career or more technical. \n\nIf you want to spend more time making designs for packaging rather than applying the designs to packages (like placing them in a CAD program, printing them out, and cutting corrugated packaging material on a computer-guided cutting table), then I would say go for the Graphic Design major. \n\nVCT, as its name implies, focuses more on the technical equipment, both software and hardware, that is used in the industry for producing visual media. Think the Adobe Creative Suite, DSLR cameras, studio lighting, video editing, screen printing, HTML and CSS coding, and more. \n\nThat being said, since VCT is called a \u201ccross-media major\u201d it does give you the opportunity to try out a wide variety of career paths in photography, videography, print design, and web design so you can really get an idea of what you like. Especially since the program requires you to do 3 co-ops (internships) in order to graduate.\n\nI went into the VCT program as a freshman thinking I wanted to do filming and editing but after taking my first photography class, I fell in love with that. Later on, I took more print classes that taught me how to use inkjet printers, lithography printers, and color theory. I took web classes along the way, but thought for sure I\u2019d be in some sort of print/photo job when I graduated. As fate would have it, I ended up working in marketing and digital content as a web designer/web content manager.\n\nThe program has enough flexibility in it that you can have a healthy mix of VCT classes and Graphic Design classes. I took Intro to GD, Intermediate GD, History of GD, Typography I and II, and I think a few others I\u2019m not remembering at the moment.\n\nI don\u2019t know much about the deciding student program. Most people I knew there just picked a major and then changed it if they didn\u2019t like it.\n\nHope this helps. If you have anymore questions, lmk.",

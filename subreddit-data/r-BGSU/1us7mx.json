    "postText": "Hey /r/BGSU, my family is opening up a Mediterranean restaurant downtown this February and I wanted to shamelessly plug it here. We are located where Dave's Cosmic Subs was, right in between Vito's and Reverends. If anyone has been to the Franklin Park Mall in Toledo we owned and operated the \"Kabob It\" there for the past 4 years and we are bringing that concept to BG. \n\nLike us on facebook: www.facebook.com/KabobItBG\n           \nFollow us on Twitter: www.twitter.com/KabobItBG",

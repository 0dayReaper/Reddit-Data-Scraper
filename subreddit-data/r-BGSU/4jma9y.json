I was a music major, so living on the music community floor was nice for me, but overall, it's just a good atmosphere. The doors don't automatically swing shut, so you'd be surprised how many people you can meet and create memories with just by leaving your door open. Enjoy BG wherever you end up living! I just graduated and I already miss it dearly. ",

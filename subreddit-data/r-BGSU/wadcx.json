    "postText": "A few friends and I created a facebook group called the \"Bowling Green Comic Book League\" (BGCL) so that we can meet other people who appreciate comic books, as well as some of the genres that are related  (like sci-fi). Unfortunately our group is pretty small right now, so we'd love to have some new members to spice it up!\nNext week we're going to see the midnight premier of The Dark Knight Rises, and we're hopefully going to meet and discuss it afterwards. Hope to see you!\nwww.facebook.com/groups/BGCBL",

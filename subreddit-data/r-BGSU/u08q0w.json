It was actually the dumbest thing, there were like 15 of us waiting outside the professors office because we \"plagiarized\" the definitions of words from the book instead of putting it into our own words. But my email was from the professor, I had to go in and talk to her, she showed me my work and told me that this was wrong and that I could be kicked out. But then said since it was my first offense with her she was going to let it slide but that my assignments were now going to all be graded by her and not her grad assistants.",

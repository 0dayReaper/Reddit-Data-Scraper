That said, the management sucks and doesn\u2019t really listen to you when you speak to them  about an issue of money or maintenance. It\u2019s not a bad place to live, the actual townhome itself, just don\u2019t expect too much (your parents either) while you\u2019re living there.",

Management is awful when it comes to screwing you or of your deposit.\n\nWe had given them every opportunity to undo the charges when we moved out that their own paperwork proved as BS.  I walked across the street and filed a lawsuit with the county courthouse.\n\nI won back the entire deposit times two (the law grants twice the deposit back if not returned in 30 days and we were approaching 60) and court costs.\n\nWas a fun experience in the legal system but your money is tied up for a while.\n\nPersonally, I think it's a good place to live for sorry term. Just cross your Ts and for your Is when moving in and out with LOTS of pictures and thorough documentation.",

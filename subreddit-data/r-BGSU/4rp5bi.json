I stayed until the end of the fourth quarter. \n\nIt was my freshman year. I came in so excited by all the talk from my brother, who had gone to BGSU during the Urban Meyer era. I was expecting high-flying football. I was expecting to blow out Western Michigan 70-7. \n\nBut no. I got 4-8. I got Mud. Poor Shaun Ellis, he didn't deserve the attention he got.\n\nHere's the [Sportcenter highlights](https://youtu.be/0UOZwFhxYkY), if you were wondering.",

Women's Basketball has made the tourney a few times and won the MAC. The guys have been improving. \n\nBut really, it's a MAC program lol. I'd say that major programs should be on this list before small town universities. ",

I'm a current undergrad so I don't know the full breadth of BG sports history, but between football, hockey, the men's rugby, women's basketball, and quidditch, BG is usually in some sort of contention, but the ratio of championships played to championships won seems quite defeating.",

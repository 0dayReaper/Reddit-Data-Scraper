    "postText": "Hi there, \n\nI'm currently a student in the UK and my university has approved me to apply and potentially study at BGSU in the coming year. I had a few questions that I hope I might be able to get the answers for. \n\nWhats student life like at BGSU? Wheres best to rent from? (I checked the list previously made, but its 2 years old!) Is there not a 'student' accommodation that is run outside of the university? I checked the website, but the ones that BGSU endorse are a little.. iffy? \n\nWhat should I expect or would be good for someone visiting the US/staying in the US for the first time? \n\nAny answers to these with extra information would be appreciated!

Distances are large enough that things like Uber would get expensive quickly without one.  If having a car is cost prohibitive, make friends with the people around you that do have a car.  \n\nMake use of free athletic tickets for home games.  You would be surprised the amount of people that go to game, even if they care nothing for the sport, it's a community thing.\n\nFinally, just have fun.  There is enough to do on and around campus to keep yourself entertained, just enjoy it.",

Rent gets cheaper the further you get from school, however the weekends are usually for parties and going out to the bars. If you are into going out to bars and clubs definitely look for something in the town as a DUI is a serious bit of trouble to get into. Get involved as much as possible, there are lots of clubs to get involved with. Hope this helps!",

            "comment": "&gt;Whats student life like at BGSU? \n\nThe town is like ~5,000 people when school is out and it's in the middle of fields. When school is in there are ~45,000 people in town. Everyone is young, and they've put a lot of money into infrastructure lately from what I've seen. \n\nThere's always something to do or somewhere to go. \n\nPretty solid nightlife (and beers will be heaps cheaper than what you're used to--but you'll have to be 21 to drink!). The main strip of the town has something like 28 bars, all within walking distance of campus.\n\nThere are tons of campus activities--clubs (as in groups, not night clubs) around campus anything from Choirs and Theatre to Water Skiing and Anime. There's also tons of computer labs, a athletic center (with exercise equipment and basketball courts, pool, etc.) and tons of opportunities for community service/charitable work (Check out Dance Marathon!)\n\nSports are big, like at most American Universities. There's a giant stadium on campus for American Football and a great Arena for Basketball. Ice Hockey is another huge sport at BG that's not super common at other Universities. Definitely worth checking out. Students (at least when I went there) got in for free to all sporting events. We also have a national championship caliber Rugby team if you're interested in that.  \n\n&gt;Wheres best to rent from? Is there not a 'student' accommodation that is run outside of the university?\n\nBasically everything in town is available for rent. I never rented from the big apartment complexes where you have three roommates. Instead I always opted to rent from [Newlove](http://www.johnnewloverealestate.com/) and got a single apt, as I prefer my privacy and space.\n\nIt's been a few years since I've lived in BG ('11 grad) but as far as I know it's still pretty much all accurate hearing from my friends who graduated as late as '15. \n\nIf you have any Q let me know. I studied abroad as well, so I know a lot of the challenges associated with it, as well as I was a guide for new arrival study abroad students.",

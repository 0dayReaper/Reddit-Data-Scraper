    "postText": "Kind of a weird question, but does anybody have any recordings of the top jazz band or any of the jazz combos at BGSU? I'm a senior in high school trying to figure out where I want to go. I am trying to decide between BGSU and University of Cincinnati-CCM. One of the most important things to me is the quality of their top jazz ensemble. All of the recordings on YouTube are from like 1981.\n\nThanks in advance!",

[You can find their contact information on the CMA website.](https://www.bgsu.edu/musical-arts/faculty-and-staff.html) They should have access to anything you would want to hear and, importantly, can definitely answer your questions. If you're coming for jazz, you'll be working with them a lot, so it will be a good chance to get acquainted and decide whether you'll enjoy working with them.\n\nI may be biased, as I'm also a music ed grad (choral), but one of the reasons I chose BGSU over a conservatory is because the professors genuinely care about you and want to help you succeed, which is something you may not get at a conservatory. Plus, our ensembles are still widely recognized and respected even though we're not a conservatory.",

I'm much more interested In jazz than in orchestra and other stuff, but I still want to do education.\n\nSorry for all of the questions, I wanted to go and do more visits and see a concert, but BGSU isn't open.",

Happy to answer as much as I can!\n\nThere isn't a specific jazz \"track\" for music ed - up until sophomore year everyone takes mostly the same classes (theory, aural skills, history, instrument techniques classes), and then there are a few classes later on that vary depending on whether you choose to specialize in choral, band, or orchestra. There are some jazz classes in there, but it isn't a huge area of focus. You can certainly take your experience in that direction though! The MUED professors are all about using what YOU are personally passionate about to inform your teaching.\n\nAs far as I'm aware, all music majors should be able to audition for every ensemble, though there may be some that jazz performance majors are given \"first dibs\" on getting into. I wasn't involved with the jazz ensembles, so Bixler will be able to give you a lot better information than I can.\n\nSorry I can't be of more help about the jazz side of things, but if you have any more questions about the MUED stuff, feel free to reach out to me!",

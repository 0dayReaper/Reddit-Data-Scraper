At Cooper Beach turn left, then after the poor visibility bridge turn right and you'll hit East Wooster Street. From there you can go downtown, but since there's no streetside parking due to the construction, you'll have to carefully weave your way into a parking lot unless you had the foresight to know to use a back street. Easy Peasy. /s",

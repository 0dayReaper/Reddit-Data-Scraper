    "postText": "Hey I don't know if this is the right place for this but I was at 149 tonight (2/2) and my jacket got stolen or mistakenly taken. It is a black knee length Nike feather coat size small. If anyone wakes up with a new jacket or your friend mentions it please let me know. It's the only warm jacket I own and I really can't afford to get a new one. Thanks guys. ",

    "postText": "I am wanting to hire a student mid April to begin helping my brother organize and pack up his belongings for storage. His commencement is first week in May and then Navy mid May. \n\nHe's got a ton on his plate and a short amount of time to do it all. He is *stressed*. He has a full apt of STUFF and furniture. He lives in Falcon Pointe. We moved him in with the help of movers but his packing was *so* horrible that it made the job so much harder. \n\n\nI want someone who knows how to sort and wrap glasses and such, to not pack the boxes so they are too heavy,  to pack Winter clothing separately from Summer, not to be too overwhelmed with the job (he will just stand or sit there shaking his head). Someone to work with him, helping him stay focused. He has so much to do between now and then that I would love to take this part off his plate. \n\n\nMust be resourceful, organized and have a hazmat suit and cattle prod (just kidding, not really). This job will most likely need to be done in stages, packed, labeled, and stored in the apt until the movers take it away. I'm offering $150 for the job. If interested, please message me.\n",

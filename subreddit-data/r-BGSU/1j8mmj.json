Don't be afraid to speak up in class, especially in classes that require participation, but make sure it's substantial, not just piggy-backing off someone else's thought.  There will be people in your classes that will want to study for exams, but are not too vocal about it, so you could break the ice if you want to study with a group or just another person.  The end of the year reviews of professors also mean squat, so if you truly have an issue with a professor go see your academic advisor.\n\nJoin clubs that you have interests in, and don't be afraid to find your niche of friends.  Don't be a jackass and pee on the way back from a bar, or party, because BGPD is always lurking about and will get you eventually for peeing behind someone's house. Just hold it in.  Be courteous to your RA's, even if most of them are relatively weird; they are mostly nice people that will be nice if you're nice.",

If your going to buy food GO TO WALMART OR KROGER outtakes is the campus convenience store and its expensive Oreos cost 8$. There are buses that go to Kroger. As for Bars SKYBAR is a freshman bar. KAMI's is the athlete bar 149 and all the others are more mixed crowds. The most fun your going to have is at house parties though.There easy to find. Anything else you might be curious about I will do my best to answer ",

The ones rated positively on Google maps have obvious fake reviews made by the property managers so it\u2019s hard to gauge which ones are good or not.",

Sharing what you\u2019re looking at online can help too. There are a few grad-only apartment complexes that I\u2019ve heard are alright",

They kicked up out in the summer after our first year because of COVID, as they used the complex as quarantine housing. They gave us the option to live in a Greenbriar owned complex right by the railroad tracks on the other side of campus. They were slightly more run down and not just grad students, but honestly also pretty nice. Repairs were quick and easy at both places, but I think that was a facet of Falcon Landing - they basically kept us on their roster even when we were at the other apartment, and did all the repair/rent/support stuff for us.",

There\u2019s also stadium view apartments closer to the high way. Greenbriar owns half the town and they\u2019re kind of a shitty company but they do have some decent cheap rentals. Campbell hill apartments are pretty big and cheap albeit dated. Are you trying to live alone or with roommates?",

I don\u2019t know how much you have to be on campus but if you\u2019re set on a one bedroom you could look into south Toledo. It\u2019d be a little more expensive and you\u2019d have a 25 or so minute commute but you\u2019d probably have more options. In town at this point though you might just have to look into roommates. I\u2019d keep trying to call up landlords for now and just see what you can find. There\u2019s a master list somewhere online of all the property managers in bg. I\u2019ll see if I can find a link for you.",

Make sure you have all weather tires and double your following distance when it\u2019s icy and you\u2019ll be totally fine. I don\u2019t love commuting but I used to commute from Yorba Linda to anaheim every day and around LA and if you\u2019ve ever driven down there then commuting in Ohio will be like nothing. Perrysburg/Maumee or south Toledo are all 20-30 minute commutes.",

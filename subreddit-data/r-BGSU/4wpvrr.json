Whitehouse has oak openings. Really great for hiking, riding a bike, etc. Globally rare oak savanna habitat. \n\nNorth: zoo, MudHens, walleye as mentioned previously. Art museum is very nice. Perrysburg has some fishing access as well. Wildwood Metropark is very popular for good reason. \n\nEast: the quarry. Also some hiking trails there. Not terrible. \n\nSouth: Findlay has a couple of reservoirs that are good for fishing. Also have a large park there that rents cross country skis in winter. \n\nIn bg: wintergarden park is nice. Carter has disc golf. There is a bike trail that goes from BG to North Baltimore, runs just west of Wal mart. \n\nSylvania has a quarry, it's about 40 min, I hear it's nice, never been. \n\nIf you're into a sport the campus doesn't offer, there is Toledo sport and social club. They have softball, kick ball, Dodge ball, volleyball, etc throughout the year. \n\nCedar point is one of the best roller coaster parks on the planet. Just go. Halloweekends is a fun time. \n",

Do it once while you live near here, though it is about an hour and a half from BG and is a whole day type of thing. \n\n35 minutes will get you to Toledo where you could watch a Mud Hens (AAA Baseball for the Tigers) Parking runs about 5-10 bucks, tickets run 12. Come Winter, you can do the same drive and cost to see some local Hockey with the Walleye (ECHL farmed to the Red Wings)",

King's has more general attractions I suppose, but Cedar Point has a much better overall selection of coasters. Nothing in the world compares to Millennium Force and both it and the Top Thrill Dragster are a lot taller than Diamondback.\n\nThis site is a bit out of date, there are two new coasters at CP not on this list so I am sure King's is missing something, but for a general comparison: \n\nhttp://roller-coasters.wanderbat.com/d/c/Kings-Island\n\nhttp://roller-coasters.wanderbat.com/d/c/Cedar-Point",

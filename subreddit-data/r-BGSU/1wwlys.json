Watch your grammar, fix typos? \n\n\"**her**\" \n\"**offically**\"\n\nAnd that's not even mentioning your horrible use of punctuation. I would never work for you because you didn't even take the time to make sure your advertisements (and job postings) look professional. Who wants to put up with that type of lackluster attitude from their bosses? \n\nMaybe your parents don't know you are posting about their business on Reddit? Take serious consideration on the image you are projecting for their business when you post this poorly written job recruitment on a major social network. ",

I chatted with the son of restaurant (I think) for a bit, about their family and where their from and he surprised me and my girlfriend with free rice pudding to what was already a fantastic meal. I hope your business enjoys a long and prosperous stay in BG.",

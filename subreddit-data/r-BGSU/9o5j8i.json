    "postText": "Hi, I am applying for BGSU Computer Science Masters program as an international student for the the January 2019 intake. The problem is that my CS bachelors score is 2.64 CGPA and BGSU requirement is 3 CGP minimum. My local consultant is telling me that he can still get me enrolled with my poor grades because the minimum requirement is flexible. Do you think is there any such possibility for me? ",

            "comment": "Current graduate student here. Most admissions programs will be flexible with GPA as long as you have good letters of recommendation. It will also depend on the program. The best thing to do right now would be to contact the department or graduate admissions to get a better answer. All programs are different so it would be best to talk to talk with a graduate advisor in your chosen field. ",

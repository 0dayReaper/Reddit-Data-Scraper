Do you think anyone would be willing to hire me, just for the summer part-time? I have been a server at a restaurant in my hometown for three years now, so a serving job somewhere would be ideal.",

            "comment": "If you want a summer job I seriously recommend trying to get hired as soon as possible. It's very hard to find a job after students leave. The town is pretty much dead, and many places cut back on hours and employees per shift. Serving is even tougher to find, but I'm sure you can pick something up if you just start dropping applications off everywhere.",

Its not the best job ever, but a job is a job. They gave me 30 hours a week and were reasonable about taking days off. The best part about the job was meeting some cool people because all the workers were students. It is also a seasonal job. Another good job is at Parker Hannifin in waterville. It is like a 20 minute drive north of bg. It is a factory warehouse and a decent place to work. They are very flexible with schedules and they pay decently. And most importantly they are currently in need of college employees for all shifts.",

Pay guaranteed at $10/hour for part time and $12/hour for full time but you can make WAY more with commission. It's inbound sales calls, not too bad if you're okay with talking to lots of people, sitting for long periods of time, and occasionally assholery from your coworkers ;-)\n\nGo here to apply: http://umg1.atsondemand.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=512277.viewjobdetail&amp;CID=512277&amp;JID=484282",

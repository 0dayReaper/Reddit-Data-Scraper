I like to have at least 2 meals per day and I'm not planning on going home too often. Do you guys think the silver meal plan is enough for someone living on campus basically all year or is it worth it to upgrade to the gold plan?",

            "comment": "My freshman year I had the silver plan for the fall semester. I had so many swipes and dollars left over at the end of that semester that I downgraded to Bronze so as not to waste any more. I certainly did eat a decent amount of food from off campus (pizza and cookie delivery) and I had a reasonably well stocked fridge for breakfast and whatnot. Unless you eat a large amount of food, silver will be plenty of food. It\u2019s probably worth getting the silver plan for the first semester and then downgrading (or upgrading) accordingly. Just make sure not to waste too many swipes as they don\u2019t carry over to the spring like falcon dollars do.",

I had bronze my freshman year and ended up adding more bc I probably spent too much money on snacks, lol.. but really i think if you are mixing that in with eating out with friends occasionally or buying snacks from the grocery store bronze is okay. But if you're leaning towards silver it's definitely enough, especially if you like getting snacks and things like I did",

You can still eat at the dining halls and actually save money because breakfast/ lunch costs less than dinner but swipes are all the cost of dinner.",

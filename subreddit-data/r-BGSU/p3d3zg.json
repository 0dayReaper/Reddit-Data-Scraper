    "postText": "So I goofed. I've been a bit busy last month and waited until the last minute to look for housing. I've called a good number of rental offices only to be told that they are at max capacity. The Airbnbs around BG are way too expensive for my meager stipend (north of $1000 a month). The website [apartmentsforrentbowlinggreen.com](https://apartmentsforrentbowlinggreen.com) does not seem to be helpful (the apartments listed are not up to date or are well into the 2022 term). The only lead I have is Greenbriar but they have an archaic system of having to show up in person in order to apply but I currently reside out of state and have to wrap up my job.  I think at this point, I'm pretty sure I will end up camping in my car waiting for a place to open up. Any advice or suggestions?\n\nUpdate: Still looking for housing but it might come down to waiting to take over leases. Thanks for the suggestions everyone, I really do appreciate it!",

IDK if you are a returning student but if you are, check to see if some of your friends have any extra space where you can crash temporarily until you get something more permanent.",

Tomorrow at the Union I will be willing to stand in the middle of the Oval in a green power rangers hoodie and wait for people to show up. I can have time to kill until around 8 pm when I'm off home for break. I can stand in the Oval from 2-5, on the basis that it gets dark by then. Bring something to talk about, share photos, draw each other I don't care I just want to meet yall finally. ",

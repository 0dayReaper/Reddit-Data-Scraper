    "postText": "I am living with two French grad students this fall.  They were out drinking this weekend and one of them stepped on the sidewalk while at a party and a cop immediately grabbed him.  He didn't know you couldn't be on the sidewalk with a beer in your hand as that is pretty much only the law here in the US.  Anyways, while the cops were handcuffing him he asked them if he could go lock up his bike (they each bought a bike from an individual at the beginning of the semester).  The cops said no and made him sit in the cop car while they wrote him a $145 ticket.  In the meantime, his bike was stolen.  \n\nSo, I'm hoping one of you know's someone willing to give or sell a bike to this guy. He is very nice and I feel like he deserves a better experience at BG than he has had so far.  \n\nThanks for reading and hopefully one of you can help this guy out.",

College is long, you're going to have plenty of time to get hammered at big keggers. Don't risk your future so you can do it 10 months early.",

They will wait in the parking lot and watch for minors in the car when the buyer goes in. They will follow the car and wait for the minor to be in possession of the alcohol and the arrest both. As for just drinking, as long as you aren\u2019t an asshole you\u2019re good to go. Good luck and enjoy BG!",

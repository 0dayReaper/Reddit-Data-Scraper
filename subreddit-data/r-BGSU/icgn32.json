    "postText": "After seeing all these other colleges shut down after a week of starting in-person classes, I wanted to see how long everybody thinks BG will stay open. My bet is it'll be a week to two weeks even though BG has regulations to go by if you do have/get Covid just so they can keep our money even though most of the college students won't ever get it and it'll probably be 100 students max who will get it.",

The only classes I can see possibly staying in-person are labs where you literally can't do the work online. Anyways, BG was never going to refund tuition for moving to online classes. The only thing they refunded last semester was a portion of room and board and some parking expenses. They've already said they want people to stay home or in an off campus apartment.",

If they close it saves them the trouble of enforcing social distancing and masks and reduces the chance of spreading Covid. And college students can get Covid the problem is most of them don't show symptoms so spread it without ever knowing they had it.",

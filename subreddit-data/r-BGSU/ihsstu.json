Especially considering lots of classes are already fully online, and many students are also taking all of their classes online.\n\nSide note: We were told that if you're a graduate student, you're likely going to have to come to campus for various things like research and whatever else, even if we close.",

This is about to be the first weekend of the school year and I have no doubt that there is inevitably going to be some kind of off-campus party that will spread COVID like wildfire- that's what happened at many of the colleges that have shut down for the semester already.",

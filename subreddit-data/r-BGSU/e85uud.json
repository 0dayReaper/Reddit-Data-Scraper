Howard\u2019s Club H has live shows Wed-Sat nights, but I\u2019m afraid it might be 21+ (I haven\u2019t been in forever). \n\nGrounds for Thought Coffee and Bookstore is a must-see local spot, and Finders Records is another popular downtown spot. As far as food Easy Street and Call of the Canyon are both slept on spots for a nice sandwich for lunch (Grounds too). Shame there\u2019s not a hockey game this weekend, we love hockey here!",

(got off work; going home, looked at the stadium, saw the gates were open, investigated, stood on the 50 in the middle of the night. super cool.)\n\n**ANYWAY**, for my buddy's birthday, I told him they don't lock the stadium at night. So we went with some other friends and played football on the field until sunrise. I kicked a field goal from the 25. Decent night.",

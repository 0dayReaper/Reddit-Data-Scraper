The theatre is a sleazy bar now, there is a dance floor where the seats were. Also the bar scene has gotten very rough with toledo and detroit over flow. It was so bad a couple years back that the police filled downtown with tear gas/pepper spray to break up a giant dj lime lights inspired street fight.\n\nAlso kamikazes is now shots, ziggys is blo, and sky bar  is liquid. I forget which ones exactly but they are now hookah bars. But brat haus got a make over and is selling great beer, no more natty light on draft!\n\nBut there are a lot of cookie stores and frozen yogurt places to hit up!",

Clazel is gone? i stopped paying attention to the place as soon as i could buy drinks like an adult, it did have a creepy vibe and most of the girls there where 16-19. You are saying its a bar now? \n\n\nedit* just read your comment again and the crapy clazel that I'm used to is the new clazel you where talking about isn't it?",

You can do everything on this still, though I am not sure what Bill's Hill is...\n\nI would also suggest a Fishbowl from Nate and Wally's and a Legal Joint from Brauthaus.\n\nThere are a lot of new places in BG, Stone's Throw/Melt/City Tap all are worth a try.  \n\nIf you are not from Northwest Ohio, there are a few things I could suggest that are within a short drive:\n\n1. The Toledo Zoo is about 30 minutes away and is top 10 in the US.\n2. Mud Hens Baseball is downtown Toledo.  They are a AAA team for the Tigers so big names play there from time to time.\n3. If you go to a Mud Hens game, I suggest trying Tony Packo's or The Blarney.\n4. Ceder Point.  This really should be the most important one.  It is an hour and a half drive, but I can't do enough in this post to sell how much fun it really is.  If you have ever ridden a roller-coaster and enjoyed it, you have to do Ceder Point.",

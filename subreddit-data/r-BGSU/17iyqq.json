            "comment": "I came into BGSU as a transfer student and was paired with a random roommate. Personally I got a great roommate but I have heard plenty of other people with horror stories, but you're likely to find that at any college. Typically people at BG are pretty easy going and involved in something. If for some reason you get paired with a bad roommate you can always switch if it's absolutely terrible or find things to do on or around campus to keep you out of your room. \n\nI would also advise to not room with high school friends. College is a time to branch out and meet new people, people who only hang out with their high school friends usually end up not making any new friends. Or if they do they're usually \"group\" friends and those just aren't the same.\n\nBG is cool, definitely consider it if you want to stay in Ohio and want a good social campus.",

One thing you have to remember is to go to class no matter how comfortable your feel about the material. I would wake up and go to work at ITS then go to class for about three hours then I could hang out with friends or do whatever. BGSU is pretty fun there is always things to do here.",

Cool guy a little too \"bro\" for my tastes, but the real problem was that he had a girlfriend who literally lived in the same room as I in harshman bromfield. She didn't even go to BG...\n\nHonestly though I don't know too many people who are still friends with their freshman roommates and where you make friends is by being active on your floor and keeping yourself out there",

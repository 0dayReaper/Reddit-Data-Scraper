If you want to get drunk and party then I would visit one of the bars or late night taco bell.\n\nIf you like coffee shops I'd go to Grounds for Thought.\n\nIf your interests are more academic then I would walk around campus more than downtown.\n\nIf you have a concern about the dorms then I would check those out.\n\nSo what are your interests? What are you looking for in a college? Have you decided on a major yet?",

I grew up in an urban areas and appreciated the small town feel of BG, but still having all the needed necessities. It's a true college town and safe place. You're not likely to leave campus and be in a dangerous area like at Toledo, CSU, Cincinnati, and other colleges in a major city.",

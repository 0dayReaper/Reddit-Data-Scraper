[Ohio State University](http://hack.osu.edu/), [The University of Cincinnati](http://revolutionuc.com/), and [Kent State University](https://khe.io/) all have their own hackathons. [The University of Michigan](http://mhacks.org/) and [The University of Pennsylvania](http://www.pennapps.com/) also have major collegiate hackathons. However Bowling Green and northwest Ohio as a whole has no collegiate hackathons to my knowledge (Not counting the failed Glass City Hacks in Toledo).\n\nDespite the name, few Hackathons are actually about hacking, and almost any major can find a roll to fill at a Hackathon.",

My buddy is a film major, and they always get super pumped about the 48 hour film festival. I want in on the slightly masochistic fun. \n\nNinja edit: \"brought up last semester\" meaning it was suggested as an event for this year, not that the idea was shot down. ",

As great as our CS department is, a lot of the faculty (not naming any names here), only want to do research. Anything outside of research and they just do not really want to do it. \n\nIf you talk to Dr. Green and Dr. Chao, they might be able to get the ball rolling to get one going. American Greetings might might still be interested in helping out.",

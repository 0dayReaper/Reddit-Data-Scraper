Your share of rent will be $255 per month, plus half of gas (which is practically non-existent), and half of the internet ($30). Electric is paid for already. Room will be available after July 24th\u2014no deposit required.\n\nGamers preferred (MtG, Hearthstone, LoL, tabletop, etc). Send me a message if interested, and we'll all get in touch to see if you're a good fit.",

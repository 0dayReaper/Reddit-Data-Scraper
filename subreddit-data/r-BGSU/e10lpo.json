Civilized and polite discussion is invited. \n\nThe \u201cFirst Lady of American Cinema\u201d Lillian Gish has had her name removed from a university theater and it\u2019s not sitting well with many movie buffs. More than 50 film industry leaders ranging from Martin Scorsese to Helen Mirren to James Earl Jones are protesting the decision of Ohio\u2019s Bowling Green State University to remove the name of actress Lillian Gish from a campus theater because she appeared in the 1915 film *The Birth of a Nation.*\n\nThe letter accuses the university of making \u201ca scapegoat in a broader political debate.\u201d Lillian Gish is considered a pioneer of film acting. {snip} She was called the First Lady of American Cinema, and for more than 40 years, the theater at Bowling Green has honored Ohio-born actresses Dorothy and Lillian Gish with its name.\n\nThat changed after students said they were upset that Lillian Gish appeared in *The Birth of a Nation* in 1915, a D.W. Griffith 3-hour silent movie that includes the Ku Klux Klan in what many claim to be a positive light.\n\nfrom\n\n [https://www.amren.com/news/2019/08/outrage-as-university-strips-name-of-lillian-gish-from-campus-theater/](https://www.amren.com/news/2019/08/outrage-as-university-strips-name-of-lillian-gish-from-campus-theater/)",

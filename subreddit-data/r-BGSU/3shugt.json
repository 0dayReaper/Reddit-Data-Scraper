I always left my door room door open and meet people on my floor that way. \n\nYou don't always HAVE to schedule with a advisor but I'm a 5th year here and did it every semester to make sure I didn't fuck anything up. No joke. ",

Leave the door open at your dorm and spend a lot of time in the community longue and what not. Find people to go to hockey, basketball, and football games with. My RA my sophomore year said something to me I will never forget. \"college can be really boring if you let it be\". Find stuff to do with either the people you meet on your floor or in your classes. And as far as advisors go meeting with them freshman/sophomore year is very common just to make sure you're on the right track. After awhile though you get the hang of scheduling classes. Im in my 4th year and haven't seen an advisor in about two years. There are \"flow charts\" on the BGSU site that will show you what classes you need to take in order to stay on track. The degree audit is also a useful tool. Although if you are feeling uneasy about anything your advisor is literally just a call away. Hope this helps!",

If you went to your advisor ever semester and you get screwed over with a not available class, you can have it waved. \n\nYou can join clubs, meet friends, play sports. ",

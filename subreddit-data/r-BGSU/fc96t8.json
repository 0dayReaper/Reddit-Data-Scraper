    "postText": "Hello BGSU,\n\nA few months ago, a Discord community by the name of \u201cWelcome to College\u201d was created for college and university students around the world. It is now over 1,200 people in size, made up of students and alumni. The server is based out of North America and we are looking to expand our community further. Unlike other Discord communities, which tend to be meetup or hangout chats with little purpose or direction, our server is focused on being oriented for college and university topics, while also offering space for the exploration of a variety of other subjects.\n\nWe have both a Semi-Vanilla and Modded Minecraft server along with a Steam group. Various community events occur weekly and our custom Discord bot is continuously being updated with new features.\n\nWe also have channels catering to a variety of interests, including sports, music, politics, technology, cars, anime, gaming, and lots more! We also have a college advice channel for people looking to learn more about university schooling, a class scheduling channel to both show-off and get feedback on your schedule, and tutoring/homework help channels with Tutors you can reach out to, along with various other college-related channels and resources.\n\nIf you need people to play games, vent, chat, or study with, consider hopping in and introducing yourself! Whether you\u2019re a high school/secondary school student or have already graduated from your university, everyone is welcome here at Welcome To College!\n\nLink: https://discord.gg/QMGCnpg\n\nTL:DR- We've made a college and university orientated Discord server.\n\nFeel free to join and hang out for a bit!",

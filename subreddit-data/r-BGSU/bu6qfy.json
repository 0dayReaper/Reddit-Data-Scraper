    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nCOLUMBUS \u2014 Ohio Senator Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, today introduced Senate Bill 156, legislation that would prohibit the manufacture, sale or possession of synthetic urine.\n\nSynthetic urine is an increasingly popular substance used by drug users to defeat drug tests, administered by employers, law enforcement or the court system. By cheating a test, workers, particularly those who operate large machinery, can put the safety of the public at risk because of their drug use.\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, at least 18 states have enacted legislation to ban the sale, possession or use of synthetic urine, including neighboring states of Indiana and Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cWorking in the transportation, trucking, and manufacturing industries requires attention to detail, critical thinking and strong communication,\u201d Gavarone said. \u201cDrug use severely impairs all of those skills, and with the easy access to synthetic urine, many are choosing to cheat a drug test rather than seeking treatment.\u201d\n\nThe bill also prohibits the use of a person\u2019s urine collected before the test or the urine of another person in an attempt to defraud an alcohol, drug, or urine screening.\n\nSenate Bill 156 will be referred to a Senate committee for further consideration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLink to article addressing her bill\n\n[https://www.sent-trib.com/news/gavarone-introduces-bill-to-ban-synthetic-urine/article\\_0e5f47dc-817f-11e9-8e96-ab0d5832b00a.html](https://www.sent-trib.com/news/gavarone-introduces-bill-to-ban-synthetic-urine/article_0e5f47dc-817f-11e9-8e96-ab0d5832b00a.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLink showing connection to Mr. Spots\n\n[https://bgindependentmedia.org/gavarone-selected-to-fill-state-senate-seat-vacated-by-gardner/](https://bgindependentmedia.org/gavarone-selected-to-fill-state-senate-seat-vacated-by-gardner/)",

That would be blood tests.\n\nAnd even those are fuckign common as hell for any job involving machinery or driving - and for good reason.\n\nI've had several of those jobs.  I PREFERRED to work for places that did drug testing because that meant I was safer.  Maybe only marginally, but safer nonetheless.",

            "comment": "If you're a small government conservative then you should oppose this bill because it's unnecessarily imposing. If a business wants to monitor for fake pee when they do their tests then that's up to them. The government shouldn't be shouldering the cost of making sure people don't own, buy, or distribute fake pee -- it should be on the businesses because they're the ones who want to do drug tests. Anyone who says they're a small government conservative who supports this bill is either not very good at being a small government conservative, or more like they're showing that what they really want is a government that uses its resources to protect business owners (who incidentally are on average much more well off than their employees) from people who use drugs, mostly weed (which shouldn't be illegal at all)(and aiming for drug users to protect business owners is pretty literally aiming to disadvantage some of the worst off to protect those who are already doing well).",

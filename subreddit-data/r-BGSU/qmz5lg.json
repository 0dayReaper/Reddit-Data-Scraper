I have the times to potentially run in college, but I don't plan too. I am just really worn out of the sport, really don't want to have to run in college, and a recent injury might hurt scholarship chances. 400m-49.5 high jump-6,3\n\nI was at a fast food place 40+ hrs a week from June to September 2020\n\nI worked at a restaurant as a head cook 30hrs a week from September to December 2020.\n\n**Schools applies to:**\n\nI am really just wanting to get into UT or BGSU and am willing to go to cc for a year then get in but I really want to go to a normal college and get out of the house. \n\n**Context:**\n\n**Freshman year**\n\nI moved back to the USA from living in Europe for a year 8th grade. I was going to a top 150 public school in the US. Took two honors english and bio. Ended with around a 2.7 or 2.8.\n\n**Softmore:**\n\nCompletely depressed and worn out and just completely gave up. I was in way easier classes but was just giving up on everything so easily. I think Q1 I had like a 2.6 and Q2 I had like a 1.6. It was a terrible start. Then COVID started S2, It wasn't as bad as Q2, but was still very drained and ended S2 with like a 2.6. Ended the year around a 2.3 gpa\n\n**Junior year:**\n\nMoved from a top 150 school to a school around 15,000. Rough first two quarters because I was working 40+hrs a week as a head cook until December. Ended with around a 2.8\n\n**Senior/current year:**\n\nDiagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Focalin XR which has really helped. Q1 3.5 and so far in Q2 4.00. I'm taking statistics and Bio 1 at a local community college and my other classes around as hard as Junior year.",

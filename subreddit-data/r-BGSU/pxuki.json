They may just \"serve food\", but some of the money that you and I give them for food is going to directly finance oppressive political groups.  It's naive to say that refusing to give money to a business that supports oppressive policy is \"[forcing] beliefs on others.\"  By not supporting Chick fil a, we are sending a direct message that we do not agree with them trying to force *their* beliefs on others.  That is how capitalism is supposed to work.",

    "postText": "So far, every vending machine I've seen on campus either doesn't vend, is out of product, refuses to take bills OR refuses to give proper change, or has moldy drinks. I'm not kidding about that last one. The vending machine upstairs in East Hall actually gives out moldy Coke, and I nearly got sick from just a few sips of it. \n\nThe only vending machines I've encountered that work are in Olscamp, and even then, they only take one bill at a time; you can't put two $1's in for a $1.25 candy bar. Seriously, what the hell? ",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I will be a Freshman this upcoming Fall (class of 2025) and BGSU and I can\u2019t be more excited to be on campus!\n\nAs I have been looking into my Housing and Meal Plan Application, I noticed that you are able to pick what specific room you want. I wanted to ask any upperclassmen/alumni what recommendations they would have for me if they were able to go back and pick their room again. Ideal dorm? Does floor level matter? Best views? Etc...\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "I personally loved living in founders and falcon heights. Founders is mostly for honors kids and falcon is mostly upperclassmen but some freshmen do get in. Most freshmen like centennial as well! As for the floor you\u2019re on, it probably doesn\u2019t matter for most cases, just depends on your own preferences. I believe all the buildings have elevators so you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about walking up too many stairs lol. The last thing I\u2019d consider is if there\u2019s a market in the building, which can be really nice, especially in winter. It\u2019s basically just a convenient store but founders kreisher and offenhaur have one in the building and centennial and falcon are right across the street. Hope this helps!",

The open door community is great, I made friends so quickly. You\u2019re next to the (better) dining hall, Dunkin, and closer to the union. Sharing a bathroom might be weird at first, but you get used to it quickly. But because it\u2019s a community bathroom, you don\u2019t have to buy extra bathroom supplies or worry about cleaning it. \n\nAlso, I felt that Mac was in the best location for my classes. \n\nCould not recommend it enough",

            "comment": "i\u2019m in founders and it\u2019s pretty nice! freshman who get in are mostly honors kids, but when you apply after this year (when you\u2019re a returning student) you\u2019ll no longer have to be in honors to get in. it\u2019s a little more expensive, but you get to have your own shower and two toilet-only restrooms in the suite! you\u2019ll most likely share a suite with five other people, but you get a little common area/living room that comes furnished with a couch, chair, and a table with chairs along with a light and come coffee tables. (also note: the six-person suite contains three double rooms with a large common area, but you also have the more expensive option of getting a single room, where there\u2019s two single rooms connected by a much smaller common area that i don\u2019t think is furnished (but i could be wrong), but i\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll still get a private shower and bathroom) there\u2019s a market in the basement (which isn\u2019t open rn for covid but we\u2019re expecting to be back at full capacity next year so it\u2019ll hopefully be back open when you get here) and if you\u2019re in honors i\u2019d highly recommend it because the honors college offices are in the basement along with some classrooms that you\u2019ll most likely have classes in (you could very easily just go to class in you pajamas and slippers!). there\u2019s also adjustable AC and heating (there\u2019ll be a little panel you can manipulate to get the temperature you want), and as for floors i personally like being above the first floor and the basement, just because those floors are higher traffic areas for people walking in and out of the building because it\u2019s also honors office/class space. the fourth floor is all-gender housing if that\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in as well! good luck and i hope you like the dorm you choose!",

I did however have the best time at BGSU and made some great friends.  I know it\u2019s been a while and lots of have changed since I was there in so many ways, but I love sharing my experiences. Don\u2019t be afraid to pm me either.  I don\u2019t know a lot about the way things have been over the last fifteen years but I still enjoy sharing my experiences.",

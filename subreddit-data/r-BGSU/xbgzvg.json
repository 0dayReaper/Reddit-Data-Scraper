    "postText": "I think it's well known enough that BGs funding isn't the greatest. It's actually amongst the worst amongst D.1 schools unless I'm mistaken.\n\nWhy does the school still offer wages of $400,000+ per year to our head football coaches when the athletic department as a whole is financially strapped? Jinks had an annual guranteed salary of 400k and then was replaced by Scott with an annual salary of 425k(after he took a paycut that is). \n\nIf I'm not mistaken the mens head coach of the basketball team is making $400,000+ a year as well. \n\nThe women's head coach is making around $245,000 a year pre annual raise.\n\nThe head coach for hockey is looking at $200,000+ a year.\n\nUnless there is some law that requires these kinds of pay, I'd set a limit of no more than $200,000 for any head coach. That's 300k+ being saved from Scott's original contract per year. That's over 200k+ from our men's head coach salary and so on.\n\nImagine how that newly found half a million dollars per year could be reallocated to other aspects of the athletic department.\n\nWhen this school starts bringing in more money, maybe then you can reevaluate paying these individual coaches that money again...\n\nAbout 1.5 million a year cut down to 800k a year for 4 head coaches even if that means hiring new people willing to work at ONLY $200,000 a year plus benefits like a house and university car and so on... I could see this benefitting the athletes across all of the teams pretty well and in turn creating a better product which could help lead to more money in the future.",

Most schools our size go negative on their athletic budget, so they would have only made 100k profit if he didn't take the pay cut. Personally I think him taking a cut in pay for his players nutrition budget is admirable. BG is lucky to have a coach that is willing to take such a pay cut to do the same job, that's a rare commitment from any employee.\n\nAre you arguing coaches are paid too much money at BGSU alone or at all schools? Or that their pay should be based on funding or performance? It's hard to stay competitive when other schools can offer coaches more money and benefits. I went to school when they were talking about getting rid of hockey. If we were to limit to $200k salary cap the quality and availability of qualified people will be incredibly low.",

In my original post I recommended that the pay be limited to 200k because of that and the fact that our current women's basketball head coach is making just north of that which shows it is definitely feasible to find quality leaders in that price range. \n\nCoaching across the nation is over paid but at better funded schools like Ohio State its not an issue paying them so much Because they have plenty of money to put literally everywhere to the point that there's Never a need for anyone to take a pay cut in the first place. \n\nAt BGSU in particular we've been severely tight on athletic funding for years so it's not even a secret to anyone who's ever been staff for any of the teams including myself. \n\nIt is hard to stay competitive I agree 100% BUT it's our reality. Fact is that at even 200k a year plus benefits you can find quality coaches, you just can't hire the typical names that will be out there. Example. Some current college coaches were literally highschool head coaches only years ago. If we look for our next head coach at the highschool level you can definitely find someone with a winning culture and sway him to move up to D1 college at that pay. He'll probably jumpsuit the moment we have a good season and someone else gives him a better offer but at that point you rinse and repeat until someday somehow we are a better funded program..",

If BG decided to cap, say, the football coach salary at 200k then the team would be even worse than they are. Now, I don't care about that, and by the looks of attendance the student body doesn't really care about that, and all the locals will still come to the games nonetheless, so really what's holding them back is (i) donors and board of trustees love having \"competitive\" football teams, and (ii) you're not seen as a real top flight public research university without a \"competitive\" football team. I think the best way to save money here would find a way to quietly switch the football team for D2, cut funding to it more, and keep basically every other sport where it's at. That might be able to save nearly 500k per year, which could be 3-5 *tenured* professors pay per year, which is better for the core mission of the school -- to be a fucking school.",

So glad that changed atleast slightly\n\nHighly doubt the story is that simple. My guess is that the best coaches -- Saban, Rich Rod, Lloyd Carr maybe even, Urban Meyer, etc., negotiated higher pays because they're the best coaches (and coaches matter a lot in college football esp.), and the universities they negotiated with care a lot about football institutionally. Then the coaches slightly lower than them negotiate for more but not as much as the higher tier, etc. etc., and then the top tier continue to negotiate for higher pay and it keeps moving everyone up until we get to this point. Never is there a point for each individual school to say no because each time it's just 25-50k here and there, but it then adds up to high salary. \n\n&gt; I honestly believe you could find great coaches at 200k plus benefits, you'd just have to keep recruiting from highschool. You'll never find someone already established at the collegiate level to come here but I wouldn't doubt it finding a highschool coach that could make that move up to college and orchestrate a 3 to 4 win season just like what were already getting. Heck Urban Meyer or Nick Saban could be coaching us right now and unless we start recruiting some of the better athletes from highschool it wouldn't matter anyway. 5 star is five star and 2 star is 2 star for a reason in prospects.\n\nAgain, doubt it. You'd need an NFL level scouting team to find just prospects for a good BG coach, and that's already way out of budget (NFL scouting teams are in the millions per year). Plus, the majority of high school coaches, even at the feeder high schools, are just not good college coaches. A good chunk of college and NFL coaches never coach at the level lower than they're at (again, Nick Saban's a good example). \n\nAlso, just to say, BGSU isn't overall strapped for cash. I don't know about the athletic dept. specifically. I'd have to look into that myself. But the university at large is pretty safe money wise. If the ath. dept. is \"strapped for cash\" it's probably because the university admin already say early on after the peak of MAC BGSU play that they'd never be the same and the chances of return to top play without a bump in funding wouldn't happen, and a peak football team isn't really worth that much to the university right now. I agree that players should get paid too, beyond scholarship and housing and such, but ironically the most likely way for BG to cut football funding even more is if like 5+ starting players all got long-term NCAA suspensions at one time.",

You saying that it's because a coach negotiated for higher pay is still one school paying more and everyone else following suit. It's like your trying to disagree and elaborate without realizing that were talking about the same thing purely because I didn't go more in depth...\n\n2. You don't need an NFL level scouting team for any of these universities. Never did. It's a matter of being able to do like earlier BG coaches and take lower prospect players, 1 to 3 star players and bring the best out of them. Michigan State routinely put together contenders in most years despite primarily only getting the 3 star and below prospects. It wasn't that analysts were wrong and marked a kid as a 2 star when he was really a 5 star all along and MSU just had nfl caliber scouts, it was that the program just did an excellent job of helping kids reach their full potential. \n\n3. You can say someone coaching highschool isn't a good college coach until they've tried and failed. Otherwise you honestly can't know if they wouldn't make a good college coach. URBAN MAYER is one of many former High School coaches that went on to Excell at the college level once given the opportunity. There's been a lot actually so I'm not sure where you got the idea that it's unlikely you can find a good coach out of highschool... \n\nLovie Smith, Chip Kelley, Gus Malzahn, and so on between not only the collegiate level but also the NFL started off as high school coaches. If we aren't being lazy and put in effort we can find a decent to good even coach as well.\n\n4. Iv been talking specifically about the Athletic department this entire time even back up in my original post. The Athletic department is definitely strapped for cash and part of the problem is purely budget allocation. Our AD Bob Moose just got fired for a reason. As a prior BG athlete and eventual staff member, I learned a lot about our situation from being involved with two of our teams while there. We could always use more money but we could be doing better even with the current resources at our disposal. No suspensions of players needed. \n\nFirst step is to stop feeling like we NEED to pay our head football coach a minimum of 400k+ when we don't have that kind of breathing space. Our hockey coach is already sitting at 200k flat which is reasonable since hockey is atleast a revenue generating sport and is usually one of our more successful teams on top of that. Lower that HC football position to 200k and find a high school coach to bring up. Never know, he could turn out to be another Urban Meyer, Chip Kelly, or Paul Johnson..",

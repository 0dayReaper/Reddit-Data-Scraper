Depending on how used to trains and noise you are, it's extremely close to campus. I had no problems with it.\n\nNot sure what you mean by \"are nearby houses quiet enough to live?\". I guess the aspects to look at are: BG has two major roads, which are Wooster and Main. Those are always busy and will always be noisy. Trains come through quite often. The east side of town consists of mostly college students, due to the university. Many students make a lot of noise. The west side of Main is pretty quiet, since it's mostly actual residents that live there. I think the south side of town, near Wal-Mart is relatively quiet as well but I'm not as familiar with that area.",

It wasn't a problem though ",

I never noticed them living in the numbered streets south of campus, which are only a couple of blocks away from the tracks.  Since there aren't actually that many crossings the train doesn't blow it's horn constantly through town so you can find some pretty quiet pockets close to the tracks.",

We got used to it almost immediately. There's a few trains throughout the day and then there's usually one around 10pm and another sometime in the middle of the night, but it's really not too bad. Although the trains have very weird whistles here, the chord is off somehow.",

    "postText": "Hey fellow Falcons! I was curious if there was a BGSU photoclub, either official or unofficial, that I could join. I just got into digital photography (from using film rangefinders and SLR's) and have been itching to use my DSLR. Just kinda looking for some folks who dig photography and cameras as much as I do. \n\nFlickr Page: http://www.flickr.com/photos/chodg/\nInstagram: coreywhodgson\n\n\nThanks!",

I think as long as you care about photography they'd let you in. I quit awhile ago so I don't know if it's active. Jeff Hall is the VCT photography professor and is in charge of the Facebook group. You might be able to start an in-person group there. By the way VCT stands for Visual Communication Technology that is a degree in the School of Technology. \n\n\nGoodluck",

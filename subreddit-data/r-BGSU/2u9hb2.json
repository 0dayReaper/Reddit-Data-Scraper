Haven't met a single girl who truly purchases their flowers and not just throws a couple bucks or expects to be smoked out. I'm not a huge fan of it personally. But it is what it is, what you make it out to be I guess. ",

Townie ents know where the forests are, actual student ents work at the small businesses for the most part, and then there's the rest of the city that work in the boring cookie cutter jobs and don't know anything about etiquette.\n\nI've got my roots in all three groups. It's the weirdest intersection of people ever.",

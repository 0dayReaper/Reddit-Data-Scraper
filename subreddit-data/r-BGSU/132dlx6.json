    "postText": "I am considering moving back to BG just because the cost of living is pretty good and it honestly has everything I really need. Cheap living, peaceful if you're not right on campus, some decent food spots open late. Within 2 hours of 3 major cities. Plus I have some connections there.\n\nI'm kinda on the edge about it and I know some people would look at it like I'm trying to relive my college life or something. But I honestly felt pretty good in BG. Also I could work nearly half the hours I currently do and still pay rent.\n\nHas anyone moved back to BG area after they graduated? Or for the townies or the ones who moved there permanently, how has it been for you longer term?",

Yes it\u2019s kind of isolated and the entertainment seems to be aimed at college age. But if you can get past that/that stuff doesn\u2019t bother you, it\u2019s great. The cost of living is insanely manageable, at least for me moving from Dallas area my jaw hit the floor. It\u2019s safe and calm. There\u2019s a huge sense of community. My neighbors are like actively interested in my well-being, tons of opportunities to network, granted the job opportunities in BG do have a bit of a cap on how much you can make and grow. But it\u2019s great, I go to tons of collegiate sports and art presentations. Detroit and Ann Arbor are very close. You can justify just going for an afternoon to either. I recommend it, it\u2019s different but there are tons of upside imo.",

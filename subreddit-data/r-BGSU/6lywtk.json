    "postText": "Integrated science major here. There's a requirement for a 3.0 cumulative gpa and a 2.8 major gpa- the advisor at orientation yesterday said that some of my transfer grades actually do count towards these figures. Do all of them? Is it just the ones that fulfill requirements of my major? I have a whole bunch of random credits from when I thought I wanted to do film, and before that I was at UC for engineering and did horribly. If that shit is weighing me down then I feel like I'm dead in the water before I've even started- I'd need something like a 4.4(!) my first semester to get to those goalposts. Could somebody help me?",

Heads up: BGSU is awful when it comes to advisors (and they're aware of this), so it's like pulling teeth and you'll have to keep following up until you get your answer. \n\nI wish you luck! ",

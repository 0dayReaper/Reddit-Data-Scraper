To match UT at least, classes would have to be moved up two weeks. UT starts August 17th while BG starts August 31st. ~~Also spring semester already starts right after New Years and even if they got rid of spring break (which is unlikely IMO) we would still end in May.~~  \n\n\nEdit: Spring semester starts February 1st.",

MSU's plan is to go 100% online after Thanksgiving. \n\nI didn't realize BG started their spring semester right after New Years. Next Fall is going to be my first semester at BG. My other college started their spring semester like 2 weeks into January.",

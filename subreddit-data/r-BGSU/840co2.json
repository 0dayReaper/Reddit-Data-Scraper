    "postText": "I have never attended BGSU, but I do live in Ohio. My only guess as to how I obtained this SD card is it's been somehow stuck in my dryer (dryer is owned by the apartment I'm in) for the past 2 years and just now came dislodged?\n\nIf that's not the case, then someone slipped this card in my pocket and it got washed or something. Which seems unlikely.\n\nThere are a good number of pictures and a few videos from a group of people in some outdoors club. There's a picture of a journal mentioning BGSU, and also a BGSU flag in a couple pics.\n\nShould I post some pictures and see if anyone can claim it? They seem to be from 2015, so it might be a lost cause at this point.",

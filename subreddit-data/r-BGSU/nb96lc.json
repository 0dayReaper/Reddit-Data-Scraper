    "postText": "Hey, all. For those of you who live off campus and use Spectrum, have you noticed frequent disconnections? It\u2019s infuriating. I\u2019ve used spectrum for 5 years, and this issue has only cropped up over the past year. Have had many technicians out and what not. What\u2019s stranger is that I seemingly only lose upload speed, not download speed - thereby, being able to still hear friends in discord even though they\u2019re unable to hear me (also disconnect from whichever game I\u2019m playing). Any else experiencing something similar? Thanks.",

I upgraded my router and now have blazing fast speeds are disconnects are rare.  I consistently get 400+, sometimes just under 500mpbs.",

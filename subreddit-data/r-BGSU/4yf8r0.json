We have four or five semiprofessional smash players (Little Mac, Kirby, and Samus mains), but we also have Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, and Poken Tournament (which is essentially Tekken with Pokemon). \n\nThe other room is board games, everything from Red Dragon Inn to Munchkin to CAH to Pathfinder to Axis and Allies to Betrayal. This side usually has more people, and is more fun IMO.",

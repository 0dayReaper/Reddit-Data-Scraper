            "comment": "On a purely serious level, has the level of play and the general maturity level of the game increased over the last few years?  During the second year of the game I was in my third year at BGSU sitting in the commuter lounge when a \"human\" player came in and started punching lockers and throwing his gear around in frustration.  It was the second to last day and he had been turned.  He went on for over an hour to the room full of people who clearly did not give a shit about the game about how he was a leader of the humans and how it was so unfair for him to lose at this stage.\n\nI know I should not let a single event like that color my experience of the entire game, but every single time I see the game played since then I just can't bring myself to draw any new conclusions.  Does anyone have any stories of situations in which the game was played in a mature fashion lately?",

However most of the time these frustrations are voiced with moderators and dealt with internally. In fact, there is a strict do not interact with \"non-players\" about any aspect of the game to prevent such negative opinions you hold now because of this persons behavior. Most people are good, fun loving and easy going about the game.",

The game always just felt extremely clicky to me and to be honest, it always left me wondering how people had that sort of free time.  I was by no means in a difficult major, but with trying to work enough to fund myself in addition to a full course load, I ended up always just wondering how anyone would have the kind of time to devote to this sort of game while in school.",

The ones who skip classes for the entire week, plan mock military strategies in their head, and deck out in gilly suits to surprise people in bushes, while strapping 17 guns to their chest.\n\nThen there's lots of folks who maybe carry a single pistol, play in between classes a touch, don't take things too seriously, and go on suicide missions for the hell of it. Those are the fun people to play with. If you ever play, just ignore the guys who seem to be \"in charge\" and have fun with it.",

The owner can get in most things D&amp;D related (just have to ask him if he doesn't have it in stock immediately), and recently we've been exploring the possibility of running in-store one-shots with the possibility of turning into longer campaigns.",

So I learned that BG has a game club and I think I\u2019m gonna wait until the big club get-together on sept 10th and see if there\u2019s already a dnd thing going because maybe there\u2019s already a dnd club who\u2019s looking to start a new game too. But I\u2019ll message you my discord and Instagram and snap too if you\u2019d like to stay in touch!!!",

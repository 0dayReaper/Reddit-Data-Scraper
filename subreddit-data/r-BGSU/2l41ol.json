I was wondering what your opinions were on those programs. \n\nWhat's the rugby team like? \n\nI'm kinda chubby so, I was wondering what the rec center there was like.  Also, would anyone be interested in helping me out once I get there?  \n\nI appreciate any help I can get and I really regret my username just incase anyone was wondering.",

Pro tip, if you need to take a girl on a date and have no money take her to the art building. There's usually a show in the galleries. Even if it's late you can watch the glassblowers. ",

I'd like to help people like myself in whatever career I ultimately select and I saw that Bowling Green State's program is very highly ranked. I was wondering if anyone has any experience with this program and would be willing to share any advice about it?\n\nThanks!",

Some of the professors I have teach the graduate level courses as well and they are all very good! If I were to pursue grad school I would definitely consider BGSU\u2019s education department. Hope this helps:)",

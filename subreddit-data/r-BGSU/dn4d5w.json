    "postText": "I do not live in Bowling Green, but I need someone to walk by a property for me and take a picture. It is very close to the BGSU Bowen-Thompson Student Union. It is either vacant, demolished, or under construction. Streetview is recent as of May 2019, and the building is still up; just need to know if anything has been done with it.\n\nIf you can help, send me a PM here and I'll give you more details. I can do Venmo or Paypal.\n\nI need this done by Monday, so hopefully, someone sees this by then.",

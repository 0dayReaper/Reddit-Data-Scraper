    "postText": "So as the title may suggest, my friend and I from high school are both planning on attending BG next year as freshmen. We are both pretty reserved people and really just want solid place, with some, but not too much concern for how much the cost of the dorms are. I have looked on the website and it showed the different options with the halls, but I thought it would be a good idea to ask some people who actually go there. I am able to get into the honors I am pretty sure without too much hassle, so I was wondering if there is any options I have for housing. Thanks in advance.",

The rooms are really nice and it is an all freshman dorm with in room bathrooms, so i would totally recommend trying to get a room there. Thing is you need to be on the ball with it because the rooms in that dorm go FAST. Im living in offenhower this year and i think its nice.",

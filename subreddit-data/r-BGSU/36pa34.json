    "postText": "Hello Falcons! Are you currently 18-24 and enrolled at Bowling Green State? Have you read or heard anything about 'hook-up culture', or participated in it yourself? I'm a sociology/public health student at another American public university, and I'm conducting a study about hookup subculture on college campuses. \n\nIf you answered yes both of the above, I'd be incredibly grateful for ~10 minutes of your time to share your experiences and perspectives via online survey. \n\nA few things you might want to know off the bat: \nResponses are anonymous. Data will be compiled, then presented to the sociology department for academic credit. This data will not be published in an academic journal. Anyone who participates is invited to request a copy of the results. (I plan to post a copy on r/SampleSize as well.) If you have any other questions about the survey or how it will be used, I'd be more than happy to go into greater depth. \n\nIf you're down to help me out, thank you(!), and here's a link to the survey: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1s3vfpGF3xSOluPJZWWcgzFna3csMpNFbDeqKhKxWsuk/viewform?usp=send_form\n\nThanks so much! Cheers!",

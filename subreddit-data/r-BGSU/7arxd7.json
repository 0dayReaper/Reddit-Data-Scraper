The only downside so far has been that they wanted us to let them know if we where staying next year in October. We moved in, in August and they asked about next year in October. The lease is for a year but you save money here than any other place around. They have a shuttle service and the BG bus comes through too. I recommend living here. The amount of space that you have is amazing compared to other places. ",

I like it fairly well, haven't had too bad of problems from the management or maintenance, and the shuttles seem pretty consistent (I don't use them). Pretty decent little community of people, haven't had any problems. The appliances are kinda cheap but they work, and for the price what do you expect? ",

The campus shuttle goes by on a regular basis which is nice (there\u2019s a tracking app). Downside is how far they are from everything. You can\u2019t walk to the bars or carry outs. Also depending on which building you get, there\u2019s a slaughter house nearby and you can hear the screams of pigs...",

    "postText": "Stuck in BG this June? Do you sell hand crafted items of any kind? Or maybe you just want something to do the weekend of the 27th-28th... I am the head of the Weston Days Festival Committee and we would love to see you there.  We are looking for crafters of all kinds to set up and sell their goods on both days and if you do food related items, we would love to have you set up at our farmers market on Saturday morning. Maybe you are a runner? we have a 5K on Saturday morning!  Just want to drink and listen to live music? The fire department has a beer tent!\n\nPm me for more info on being a vendor or with questions about the festival!  Like us on facebook and help us get the word out! https://facebook.com/WestonDays\n",

I have a question about BGP courses as they relate to my major. Can BGP courses also fulfill credit requirements for my major?\n\nThank you for your time, and I look forward to your response.\n\nSincerely,\n[name]",

I think maybe I had one that did, but also that might\u2019ve been something else. Perhaps I did not and really never did? Well...here\u2019s my advice:\n\nShake a magic 8 ball or contact your advisor. Your audit MIGHT have that info depending whether or not you\u2019re in a course right now for that",

    "postText": "Alright so I'm not trying to be a dick here but I was looking at some college statistics and this caught my eye. Does anybody know how BGSU has such a low acceptance rate? Looking at ACT scores and GPAs, BG's peers in Ohio are schools like Kent State and Cincinnati, however looking at acceptance rate it's close to OSU, one of the best public schools in the country. Does anybody know what causes this disparity?",

The study of supply chain management was invented as a curriculum and we were rated as the 2nd best school for supply chain internationally back when I was a freshman there (09). ",

I'm telling you, it has not been single digit ranked since at least 2008. The case competition (which I've competed in multiple of them) ranks have nothing to do with program performance. A better analogy would be like ranking a basketball team based off your star players skills in a dunk competition. Also business insider is literally the buzzfeed of professional life.",

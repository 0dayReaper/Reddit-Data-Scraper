So, is there anything I should know beforehand? Like if it is full of \"weeaboos\" or very nerdy young kids who don't know when they are annoying? IF anybody knows please say so its this Saturday",

No one was doing anything noticeably stupid or disruptive, so that seems like a good sign. \n\nAlso, rolling out of bed in the morning for work and walking into an anime convention you had no idea was going on is an interesting way to start the day.

(Part of this is because the student union is still open to the public during Animarathon, so there will be people walking around who aren't actually attending the events.)\n\nUsually there's a handful of people who don't realize or care that they're being excessively loud, or getting in the way while they're stopping and posing for photos. I think the only thing that's happened to me there is that one year, I was walking along in one of the public areas when a guy who was taking a picture for some cosplayers decided *really suddenly* to take a couple steps backward without looking behind him, which is where I was, so I got slammed into a wall pretty hard. He did apologize, though. So basically you might have people behaving inconsiderately, but nothing serious. ",

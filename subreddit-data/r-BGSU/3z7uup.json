I spent a week in Denver, made 6 round trip flights, and overall I vacationed in Tampa, FL, Indianapolis, IN, Oakland, CA, Baltimore, MD, Buffalo, NY, Pittsburg, PA, Phoenix, AZ, Cleveland, OH, San Francisco, and Denver, all this year. I had a girlfriend (who ended up being a terrible person), and in the ~2 years of working I've also managed to save up over 30k in only-from-paychecks money, plus 401K. I work in Cincinnati, Ohio as an iOS developer. My student loans weren't bad, I only owe around 18k right now IIRC but I make quadruple payments every month (~$1000/mo). Full insurance through work.\n\nI live very comfortably. I happen to enjoy traveling, most of my coworkers probably save more money than I do though. This year I plan on either going to the Superbowl (If the Bengals make it), or purchasing a house.",

In highschool I programmed video games, so I came into BG with a bit of an advantage. I flew through the classes with ease, while still learning a good bit of how to be a \"real\" computer scientist (and learning what it REALLY means to be a computer scientist)\n\nI ended up getting a job at the Agile Software Factory, which is a CS department employment opportunity that I was paid decent money ($12/hour while a student). I did iOS Development there, as I had already published my own iOS apps to the store (Ampache on iOS, https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ampache/id532578754?mt=8). I made the BGSU Campus, BGSU News, BGSU Athletics, BGSU Cares, and a few other apps while I was there. That helped me build up a decent iOS resume.\n\nDuring my interviews, I found a company that really appreciated my iOS drive and experience and I was given a good offer! :-)",

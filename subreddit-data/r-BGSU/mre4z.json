Employers don't care so much about a specialization as they do your experience, skills, and what you can bring to the table. And the 48k is an average starting salary for SCM students that graduated from BGSU, not THE starting salary for any SCM starting job. Some will have a starting salary above 48k, and others will have one much below that figure. I'll be lucky to even find a purchasing/logistics job close to where I want one after graduation.

I understand that I didn't pick a major that is particularly aimed at making money right out of college, but I've seen enough of my friends graduate with degrees aimed at making money only to work at Applebee's, or have some mid-level management job that doesn't require a degree.

It has more to do with the fact that I just love to drink. To be honest it would be easier for me to continue to go to school and drink heavily, rather than work 40 hours a week. Especially at BGSU, most of the professors are a joke. There are a few that actually challenge their students, but most of them are reusing the same lame ass Power points from the book then reading you the book to you durring class. This is to be expected at a college state college that requires the same test scores as a community college. \n\nI know my perspective on education is a jaded one, but it's for the most part right. America's education system is designed to keep people in the economic class. Though education can introduce people to new opportunities, it's rarely a result of what they learn in the class room and most often because of the networking the did in their free time. College isn't bad, paying outrageous amounts of money on it is. Especially when you can achieve the some level of success by spending all of your time on Wikipedia, and Facebook. ",

Trying to find a career without a paper saying I can teach myself would make me want to drink as well. \n\nShit I doubt any of these classes will do anything for me but the companies love that well rounded bullshit. \n\nThat being said, I also hate BGSU. Nothing to do here. I don't drink, do drugs or party so wtf can I do. Going to NKU next year, at least I'll be closer to home if I don't find shit there.\n\nComputer science is my major, without some form of school work. I really doubt I could push myself to learn a new programming language or be able to really do something professional. So I'm willing to pay for something that will get me a career that pays good money and will be useful for a long time",

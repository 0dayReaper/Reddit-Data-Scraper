WorkNet typically has some listings. However, if you are ever in one, ask a cashier or a manager if they are hiring. Generally, a really easy way to get a job around campus is to just give them your schedule. They are almost always hiring student workers (for reasons I will get into next) so maybe you can find an open slot. Years do not matter. It's availability that matters.\n\nWhat is it like? It's easy food service work. Most of the students do food prep, serving or cleaning. Students typically don't handle money. It's not hard but it's not fun. It's money though, especially if you are paying your way through college and/or you live on campus. Worst parts about it are 1) the variety of people you meet. Some people don't want to do dishes or clean. They don't stay long. Sometimes, people are just bad workers. You will encounter that everywhere. 2) Work schedule isn't very flexible. It's great because you will get a weekly schedule. However, if you want to go to a concert Tuesday night and you normally have to work Tuesdays, you have to find a sub. If you don't, it counts against you and can be frustrating. \n\nAnyway, hope this helps!",

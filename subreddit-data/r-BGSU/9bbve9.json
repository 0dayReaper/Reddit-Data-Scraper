    "postText": "I only got a parking pass in March last year so missed the early semester rush. It's honestly impossible to find a spot midday and it's killing me--I teach and tutor on campus around noon four days a week and it would be a very bad look to be late to either of those, but I'm getting there 45 minutes early and still barely making it. When does the parking crush normally ease up?  I'm gonna get a ticket or miss something important sooner rather than later if this keeps up.\n\nIf parking or admin ever read this: give students with TA/TI/GA-ships the option to buy staff permits since we're doing staff work!!!",

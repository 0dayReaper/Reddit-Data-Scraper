Better go fast if you wanna investigate that - They're tearing it down next semester.\n\nThere's a public school in Toledo that ended up with one of Nikola Tesla's personal Tesla coils. Not sure which one got it exactly.\n\nThe railway station in Findlay from the 1800's is supposedly haunted, as are some of the gas boom relics like the Great Karg Well.\n\n[I referenced this website for a few more ideas](http://www.forgottenoh.com/Counties/Wood/woodcounty.html).\n\nIt's burned down for over a decade, but apparently the Potter House outside BG was a goldmine for this sort of thing because some dude lost it and murdered his whole family there in the 70's. Ruins might still be around.\n\nThe upper floors of SamB's and parts of Euler Road are supposedly haunted.",

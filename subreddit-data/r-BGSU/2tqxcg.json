                    "comment": "**Sports Bar:** Frickers\n\nNone of the sports bars in BG really have great food, but Frickers has a consistent menu and low prices. The experience is nice, without being totally overwhelming. Honorable mention to City Tap, which I wouldn't classify as a sports bar technically, but that has TVs with most games on.\n\n**Burger Joint:** City Tap / Two Foxes\n\nThis is a split, and it really depends on what experience you want. \n\nCity Tap is loud, fun, and has a wide variety of beers and drinks. They also have a decent deal on Tuesday nights for two burgers at the cost of one. During the warmer months, their outdoor patio is a really relaxing way to spend and evening.\n\nTwo Foxes is brand new and has some really unique and amazing burgers at really reasonable prices. Normally it is a very quiet and relaxed environment without many TVs to interrupt the experience. They do not have a HUGE selection of beers, but what they do have is amazing craft beers on tap. You can get bottled beers if you prefer something more mainstream. With them being new, they can be slow on service if you go during a peak hour.\n\n**Chinese** The China\n\nThis is not even close. The China, located near the Fair Grounds, is easily the best Chinese in BG. The food is amazing and way, way above the quality of the competition. They do not have extensive hours, so make sure to go around standard meal times. If you are looking for a buffet with longer hours, I would recommend Old Time Buffet near the mall. If you are looking for take out, go with King Buffet for quantity for price and Bamboo Garden for quality. \n\n**Pizza** Myles\n\nThis one is harder. I am answering all of these based on where you would go to sit down and eat. Personally, I prefer Dominos are Vitos for take out, but Myles is really an experience you have to have while in BG. The inside is a little run down these days, but the atmosphere is really nice and the pizza is a trip. Go on a Wednesday and get dollar drafts. Campus Pollyeyes has amazing bread sticks, but the pizza is middle of the road. \n\n**Mexican** El Zarape / Qudoba \n\nI think most of BG would want my head if I didn't put Zarape on this list. Food is reasonably priced and well prepared. Their margaritas are amazing, and come in insane sizes. I do like the point out that they have been around for over 15 years while every other sit down mexican place goes under within 3 years, so that has to count for something. \n\nIf you are looking for quick style food, I personally love Qudoba. They have a much more diverse menu then Chipotle. I know some people LOVE their Chipotle so I guess this comes down to your preference. ",

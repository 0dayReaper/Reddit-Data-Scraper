    "postText": "Whats up, I'm a college student, though not really college aged (25), new to town for an internship and looking for some people to jam with. Wasn't sure what the best sub to post this on would be but at my university I've seen plenty of people look for jamming partners on their sub so figured I give it a shot. I can play guitar or bass, and while I'm not terrible, I still have a lot to learn. Unfortunately I am pretty busy and so really only have time available on Friday, Saturday or Sunday. I'd be willing to play almost any genre. If anyone's looking to jam let me know!",

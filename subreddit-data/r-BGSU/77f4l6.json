    "postText": "OH BOY. I hate the commuter parking on this campus. Why the fuck is there nothing in the middle where all the buildings are. They could make half of the Wolfe Center parking lot commuter, or part of the Union parking lot. But NO! I have to walk my ass across the railroad tracks or from Lot 12 to get anywhere. \n\nWhat are your commuter parking experiences?",

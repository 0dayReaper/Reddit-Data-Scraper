    "postText": "So I thought I had all of my classes planned out in order to graduate in spring 2015. It turns out, I will be missing ONE credit hour at the 3000/4000 level. Any suggestions for what I could / should take to fill this? My major requires 40 credits at the 3000/4000 level, so as far as specifics goes, there aren't any :D. ",

It is a class in the library where they teach you to use research tools.  My dad told me about this so I'm paraphrasing it the best I can but I think you could probably do it. it was designed for people who needed extra credits later in the semester.  There is also a way to design a 1 credit hour independent study.  If you have a favorite professor, or one that you know decently, ask them about it.  They usually know how to do it, and if they don't you can PM me for more info.  I have done a lot of them.",

I can't remember for sure, but I think Greek mythology is a 3000 level and doesn't require much work. It's more credits than you need, but if you enjoy the class it won't feel like more work",

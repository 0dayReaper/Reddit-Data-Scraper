She'd rather live off-campus in an apartment next fall and her dad said she needed to sign a lease by January or something to do that.\n\nAs someone who's been in the military and has never had to go through this process, I'm not really sure what she should do, how to do it, or when. \n\nSome education for me might help me help her.\n\n",

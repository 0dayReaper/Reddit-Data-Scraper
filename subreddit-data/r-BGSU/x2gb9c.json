The office was always a welcome hangout spot in the union. They had a bunch of desks, a couch etc. You get to meet all the bands/artists who come to campus to perform. In my time, we had Kid Cudi, 3oh3, Cobra starship, Florida Georgia Line, Bo Burnham. You can Collab with other organizations too.",

I'm biased toward Ten40 since that's the one I was in, but I hear there are 4 groups now and they're all fun to be in!\n\nI know at least Ten40's auditions are coming up soon, I would assume the other groups (Acouschicks, Tonal Eclipse, and I think the new one is called Retrograde?) are going to have auditions soon too.",

    "postText": "Not sure if anyone would be up for a CS discord to allow you to connect with classmates to work on group projects and side projects but I'm thinking of making a discord for this. Obviously we would have rules in place to help against academic dishonesty because I don't want anyone getting in trouble over using the server but I feel like it could help people branch out and connect with others in their major. I'm doing CS because I'm a CS major and I feel like most of us would use discord at one point or another, and while doing group homework or side projects it could help with letting those who need to connect with each other.\n\nNot sure how many CS majors are on this subreddit but if any are and would like to have this let me know because I made it already, I just need to iron everything out and invite people.",

I don't know if any professors or TA's use this subreddit (my 45 year old manager at my work spends his entire day on Reddit so you can never be too old lol) but you might need to set up guidelines about what to post.\n\nUnfortunately, unlike the real world, you are not supposed to work together on projects unless it's the software development class. I graduated three years ago but someone in one of my classes mentioned something along the lines of, \"Amy and I were doing this and we couldn't figure out how...\" which led to the instructor dropping everything and giving us a lecture about how we cannot work together. We can ask questions about concepts but we can't work together. (People work together all the time. I worked together with some friends. We just never mentioned it to anyone and made sure you couldn't tell we did not work together.)\n\nI think your idea is great, but you'll have to enforce that folks only talk about things conceptually instead of outright asking how to write a loop to do this and what not. Hopefully all of this made sense.",

Honestly, I believe that most projects in CS are better done in a group and most classes encourage it. As long as you aren't sharing code and you are actually working together, I believe that their is nothing wrong with it.",

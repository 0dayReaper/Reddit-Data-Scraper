    "postText": "Hey Guys, looking for some suggestions on apartments or preferably homes for rent. \n\nWe\u2019re on a month-to month lease right now so move-in dates are flexible. Ultimately looking for a two bedroom that will allow our dogs. I work in Toledo and my girlfriend is taking classes in Findlay, so BG is kind of the middle ground. \n\nGreat income, decent credit. \n\nThanks in advance.",

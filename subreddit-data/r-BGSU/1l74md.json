As a sophomore who just wants to make sure you guys aren't ridiculed by basically everybody that sees it, please don't use those things to carry the ID. Just put it in your wallet or something, and fear not about such silly things as LOOKING like a freshman. Cheers to all you new people.",

It broke in about a month and it was like 20 bucks for a new one, but I missed it. That said, even though I carried on of them around I met a group of upperclassmen that became my best friends. They didn't judge me for something as small as my fucking wallet. These are real friends. Personally I wouldn't even talk to any of you fucking idiots that say, \"you shouldn't carry one because they make you look like a freshmen.\" Everyone thinks that things change when you get to College or out into the workforce, but they don't. OP and everyone that agrees with him are they same judging idiots they were in High School and they will be the same way once they get a job. You know what judging people gets you; Nothing! You get to hang out with people that think the same way you do. No one ever challenges your ideas and you never experience new things. \n\nSOURCE: Former BGSU student now living in CO working at one of the Fastest growing companies in America. \n\nPS.

For that, there's much better alternatives like zenpen.io (which has a hella nice medium-toolbar in it that I need to clone sometime). The twitter is so that you can one-click publish and don't have to worry about another login, then share that url and let other people read what you write, hence the \"blogging\" aspect.",

Most people are finding it via twitter, and those writing small posts to post on twitter is pretty much the main audience.\n\nI totally respect not using twitter, but this is most certainly not the first service to use it as a login platform.",

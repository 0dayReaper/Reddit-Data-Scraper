The university cut the budget for the planetarium 30% this year, and a back up projector for these sorts of problems was never acquired. So the shows being played right now are using the system from the 80's, which is okay, but they're falling apart. I suggest waiting for the Christmas shows if you want to see a good one. ",

Favorite bar is definitely quarters, they know how to make drinks and it's not too packed to enjoy. I'll graduate in May so if there's anything I should do before I leave I'm definitely open to suggestions!",

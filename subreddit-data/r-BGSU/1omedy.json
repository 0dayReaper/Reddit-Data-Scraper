    "postText": "Hi, fellow Falcon and alum Redditors! Just wanted to make a post about the Take Back The Night event which happens tomorrow on campus! It will be hosted in the multi purpose room of the Student Union and starts at 7pm! It is a march and rally to stand up against rape, sexual assault, street harassment, and domestic violence. This is for women, men, and those with non specific genders. We're focusing a lot also on the harassment and discrimination against individuals of color and those within the LGBTQ community.\n\nWe will be having music performances, spoken word, and safe places to share experiences with any of the above topics! If this sounds like anything you'd like to be a part of or support, I would strongly encourage you to come on out with us! :)\n\nOh, and after the march downtown, I'm probably going to Blo, so you're welcome to come there too!",

So basically, ain't no way I can sleep for 5 or 6, let alone 8 hours straight at home, and I'll have to try to get a few hours of sleep at school a few times a week.",

Also about the library, the only real sleep able place would be either in the booths on the learning commons, or the little lounge thing that's to the left when you enter. Lastly, if you ever go to the Oaks, try just sleeping upstairs. The employees won't bother you because they don't care that much, plus you can eat more when you wake up.",

            "comment": "I have lived at ST for a year now and while the apartments are nice they are sinking into the ground resulting in cracks in the walls and doors getting hard to open which need maintenance.\n\n The recent acquisition by Kwapich has made dealing with the office way harder than it was when we had our lease drawn up and it really feels like they are driving this complex into the ground like every other company in town. \n\nAs for amenities: we were told the pool would be opened and when it was found to be broken this summer, they ignored emails and then decided to put in a \"gym\" which is going to be in the  old maintenance room and when asked to drain it to avoid mosquito and other bug populations from expanding here, we were told they were going to take care of it that week (over a month ago now) but instead we have been watching the water steadily rise and turn greener and greener. \n\nRegarding management: a week before we moved I called to make sure we were ok to get keys and we didnt get a good response until 24 hours before move-in stating we had to get certified funds from the bank to pay our prorated rent (NOT our security deposit which was already paid). We also had issues getfing in touch to make sure everything was set up. We had two friends move in last year as well. One set had their SIGNED lease LOST by the office and when they arrived to move in were given trouble. Another set of friends had their apartment not cleaned or prepared for their move in date. Our last major issue came with updating our lease to include this summer. A contract that should have taken a week or two max to negotiate took over a month because we would not get a response to questions/ move out date negotiation for several days up to 2 weeks after we would pose one. In the end they have us moving out August 15th before graduation, making a big deal about how students need to move in for the fall semester; but one of the sets of friends mentioned above has a sibling moving in here and their move in date is AFTER the semester starts. They are out of touch with the college calendar and refuse to work with tenants in a reasonable time period. \n\nOther general complaints include the laundry card machine to pay for laundry being down for a week plus at a time, office hours being inconsistent, internet frequently going down (multiple times a month with no explanation sometimes for an entire day at a time), a \"pet free property\" suddenly being allowed pets after we signed, note: our lease says no pets but other leases allow them (know someone here got bitten by an agressive dog following this change also dog poop is frequently not picked up). Oh, and I think a utlity fee is being added so goodbye included utilities.\n\nFor the good things: Denise is great, as is the tall maintenance man! They are some of the better employees at kwapich and do a much better job at ST than previous employees when we first moved here. The apartments are nice (all hail the gas stove) and fairly spacious. Its also quiet which we like, so if this stuff is good enough take my experience with a grain of salt. If it helps i would probably resign if I was staying in town another year, there just is a lot to be aware of otherwise.",

Denise the manager is super nice and understanding. Only downside right now is that the pool is broken. But they are putting in a gym right now.",

            "comment": "Summit Terrace is a fairly decent place to live. My girlfriend and I signed a school year lease(August-May) and recently moved out this year. It is a fairly cheap place to rent for 1-2 people. Before living there, i had previously lived at The Edge which was insanely expensive and overall not worth it in the long run. Everything except for electric was included in rent. The WiFi is not the greatest at the apartment complex. Doing school work/working from home was not ideal. It would cut in and out on a daily occurrence as an FYI. Maintenance typically is very quick to resolve things if something has happened. A few examples I\u2019ve seen/experienced include our heat randomly not working and a mouse problem we had. Maintenance fixed those problems in a timely manner. The complex is on the older side, I would definitely recommend getting renters insurance. During the winter, a apartment in our building had its pipes burst and it essentially ruined everything in there. Also be careful on where you park your car in the lot because with snow removal you be blocked in. Management there is very spotty. When we first moved in we virtually had no contact with management. It slowly got better with time but still not great. Our apartment was not cleaned before we had moved in. However it is not all bad, the middle green area with picnic tables is a great place to hang out with friends and play games. Besides the train, it is a much quieter place to live. It is also in walking distance to downtown but I would say a little too far from campus. The apartment itself is a good size and very spacious. I wished there was more storage but that just might because of all the boxes we kept for when we moved out. I do have more to say so feel free to reach out for questions",

            "comment": "This coin has two faces. I will explain both in the attempt to give you all of the information to make your decision.   \n\n\n**Positives:**  \nI lived in a New Love Rental for one year and I can confirm living with them is awful. ST will **DEFINITELY** be an upgrade for you. Utilities are included (for a small fee now) with the ST apartments and you only pay for electric. I lived in a two bedroom apt and I felt my roommate and I had ample room for ourselves and guests. First floor apartments also have gas stoves/ovens which is an upgrade over nearly anywhere else in town. Maintenance is quick and solved my problems no matter how small within 24-48 hours via online requests. All apartments have an outdoor space/porch around back which is really nice to spend time on in evenings! The mix of college students and townies gives a very nice vibe/neighborhood feeling. My sister recently moved into my very apartment per my recommendation and is looking forward to living there two years or more depending on her degree path.\n\n**Negatives:**  \nA simple shortcoming with the apartments themselves is that they use a single AC unit at the front of the apartment to cool the entire apartment and depending on the luck of the draw you may get an apartment with a really old/inefficient one that runs up your electricity bill despite not cooling the entire space.\n\nManagement at this apt complex is horrendous in terms of being available/in the office. It is highly likely that you will call during business hours and they simply do not pick up. They changed managers in the summer of 2020 and the new office workers managed to lose my lease prior to moving-in which was a debacle I dealt with on day one.\n\nAnother shortcoming of this apt complex in my eyes was their stance towards pets. My lease strictly stated no animals on the premise; however, this has since changed for new leases. This is problematic as they do not have any sort of verification process or screening system on the dog/cat itself. I suffered a very dangerous dog bite on the property by a dog that should not have even been there in the first place according to *my* lease. \n\nFinally, Summit Terrace states they require renters insurance for all residents, but this is simply untrue as the offenders of the dog bite did not have any and I am now having to take them to court for my medical bills. Its a positive requirement at apartment complexes, but there is no rule enforcement it seems.  \n\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nSummit Terrace is a lovely place in BG to live and I wish I had lived their longer than one year off-campus, but just like every place to live in BG/the US, there are shortcomings you deserve to know ahead of time! I would call the office sometime and ask them about anything pressing this post or any others on here have detailed.",

    "postText": "Hey /r/BGSU, I\u2019m a second year looking for more things to do, and this summer I got involved in some 5e campaign that my friends wanted to do. I was wondering if there were any kind of groups in BG that are accommodating to somewhat beginners, and aren\u2019t too serious. Also any other kind of board game groups, on campus or not. I love in Offenhauer, so if you know of one or are looking to start a group, hit me up",

They usually have I think 2 or 3 campaigns of various pen-and-paper rpgs going, as well as rooms for smash bros and other video games in addition to their main room for people to play board games. Look for them at campus fest to get on their email list! ",

We have also discussed possibly holding like, a few club sessions maybe this year. Usually though for that type of stuff I'd recommend Gaming Society",

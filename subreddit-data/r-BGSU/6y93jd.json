For most dining areas, if you walk in with your schedule and say you applied online and that you'd like to follow up, they are eager to find a time you could work. They were during the first month of every semester when I worked there, anyway.\n\nAnd it's not uncommon to submit a resume to a food or retail job. It's a paper with all of your information, which makes it easier to right click and save to their computer, rather than go through all of the info in the application that gathers every one that was submitted.\n\nIf you aren't interested in food service, follow up to the jobs with a phone call. Phone number not listed? Google the hall/facility you're looking for and call that.",

Chances are they'll tell you enough insightful things that you'll be fine to resubmit it, albeit for the 5th time.\n\n2. Think about off campus jobs, especially the fast food places on Wooster, and the casual restaurant places toward Main Street. Depending on where you live, the walk is definitely manageable, and places like Taco bell are starting at 9.50 instead of 8.15.\n\n3. Try talking to the places you're applying to; if you want to apply to be a student monitor at the PD, then fo to College Park and ask them about it without mentioned that you've already submitted. Try that with whatever jobs you've applied for -- find the actual location where the job's at and talk to them.\n",

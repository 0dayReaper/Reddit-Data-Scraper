That's fine because about five thousand other freshmen are also going to look like freshmen. Be kind to others, look both ways before you cross the street, get a map of campus and walk your class route before the first day, and drink lots of water when you party and you'll be okay friend. ",

Town is safe, but the first 2 or 3 weeks when the weather is nice, and there are so many new faces, there are always a couple of incidents. Safety in numbers, especially after dark. \n\nMake friends, have fun, go to class, get involved with experiences beyond the classroom, and in 6 years you may just wish you were a freshman again. It's a great experience, one I would do again any day. HS was a drag. College was an opportunity. Work hard and enjoy it.",

Lanyards are fine, but not the BGSU freebies they give you at orientation week that all the other freshmen will wear around their necks with their PED. \nMake sure to introduce yourself to your professor after your first class with them. They'll remember you and like you more and if you ever have issues with grades, probably help you out there. \nAlso don't wear tons of BGSU or any of your high school logo shirts. \n\nYou're definitely going to look like a freshman and it's completely fine because there are thousands of you, but as long as you walk on the right side of the path and don't take it up with your new group of friends who you're totally going to be best friends with forever (I give it until November), you'll be fine. \n\nAlso, skip Clazels and head to the Attic instead, and always eat at dining halls on tour days.

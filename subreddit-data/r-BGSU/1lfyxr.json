    "postText": "Having worked with Canvas for a while, one of the most common questions I see students asking lately is how they can get old courses off their list in Canvas.  \n\nHere is a quick guide on customizing your courses list:\nhttp://guides.instructure.com/s/2204/m/4212/l/48284-how-do-i-customize-my-courses-dropdown-menu\n\nIf you really want to get those courses gone, you are going to need to talk to your instructor.  Here is a guide you can even pass to them on how they can concluded past courses and move them to a read-only state:\nhttp://guides.instructure.com/s/2204/m/4152/l/57128-how-do-i-conclude-my-course-at-the-end-of-a-semester\n",

            "comment": "This is a very informative and useful post. I'm glad someone else is concerned about their Canvas experience. In addition, if your professors need Canvas assistance (or you've noticed that your learning experience is being hindered by your professor's lack of knowledge regarding Canvas) you can point them to [The Center for Online and Blended Learning](http://cobl.bgsu.edu/index.php) (which will be known as The Center for Faculty Excellence soon enough). We provide Canvas support and pedagogy assistance for professors who would like to take their teaching experience to the next level. I recommend they make an appointment; we're extremely busy.\n\nIn addition, if there are students that need help utilizing Canvas they can visit the [Student Academic Resource Center](http://www.bgsu.edu/its/arc/), which is now located in the library.",

I lived in Kreischer Freshman year, the lack of AC was horrible. I moved to Offenhauer my sophomore year and that one was pretty good.",

            "comment": "I lived in Kreischer for 3 years and would highly recommend it. Yes, the lack of AC sucked for the 2 months when it was hottest, but with fans and opening your window and door it was fine. Kreischer rooms have an incredibly large amount of space compared to some of the other dorms. It also encourages community and makes it a LOT easier to meet people and make friends. Offenhauer is kind of like this too. I had several friends in Falcon Heights and Centennial who regretted living there because no one ever talked to each other. Don\u2019t dwell too much on the AC factor in my opinion, as making connections as a freshman is more important and will lead to a much more exciting and successful experience",

There's also a market inside which is nice for late night snacks.\n\nDefinitely do not go to Kreisher. Everyone who lives there has told me they don't like it. Plus, it's a pretty far walk from center campus and waiting for the shuttle in the cold sucks.",

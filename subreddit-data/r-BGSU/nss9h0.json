Im thinking centennial or Offenhauser but am unsure. \n\nthank you :)) I really hope people respond",

I lived in Conklin and had an amazing time and made life long friends with a good chunk of my floor. The building has A/C, is a bit smaller than others, the rooms are solid and the people made the time great.",

    "postText": "... is not a real organization, yet.\n\nI'm looking to gauge interest in a potential electronic music club here on campus. We would meet either weekly or once every 2 weeks for ~2 hours to learn about the history of various electronic sub-genres by listening, explore production tools, and share music we enjoy (as long as it falls under the electronic music umbrella).\n\nIf you are interested or know someone who might be, please contact me either here or by e-mail (gtraut@bgsu.edu). I'm open to suggestions and will take your availability into consideration when scheduling meets. If sufficient interest is generated, I'll move forward with the registration process.\n\nThanks!",

That might make for more active and engaging discussion to attract those who aren\u2019t so inclined to music studies \u2014 Merely a suggestion. I wish this was something when I was in school but I was not nearly as EDM-biased as I am now!",

The club's main focus would be sharing music we enjoy informally, but that would be after the main topic of the day (could be a historically significant mix like Dubstep Warz or FabricLive.37, one of RUN DMT's genre history mixes with commentary, or a short documentary). I want it to be more informal than academic for sure so I'll try my best to make it enticing for general EDM fans as well as Music students.",

It\u2019s something you really can have fun with, especially if you encourage the PLUR culture so BGSU backs you, so just make it fun and maybe nerdy and have some fun events that draw people. This could really be great I\u2019m sure",

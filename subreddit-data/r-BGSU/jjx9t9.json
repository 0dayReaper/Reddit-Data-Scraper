I\u2019m a longtime Reddit lurker but I finally decided to make an account. \nI\u2019m living at home in Cincinnati right now so I\u2019m not expecting nearby bars or restaurants to show the BG v Toledo game. Are there any good places to stream the game? I\u2019ve tried googling and haven\u2019t had a ton of luck.",

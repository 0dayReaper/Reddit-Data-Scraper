    "postText": "Hey guys. I\u2019m a DPT BGSU student, recently was accepted. Looking for housing options! All the reviews I\u2019ve seen online are primarily negative. I\u2019m looking for positive reviews but have yet to see them \u2014 if they are positive it\u2019s the owners making a fake positive review. I\u2019m torn between living in Bowling Green, Ohio or just living in a quiet apartment in Perrysburg, Maumee, or even Toledo. I\u2019m studying 60 hours a week, need a quiet place to study but also want to be social in the rest of the time I have left. What do you guys recommend? I also don\u2019t want to pay $1450 a month for rent \ud83d\ude2d also prefer living alone. Thank you so much in advance!!",

            "comment": "My gf is currently in the DPT program here and we moved to BG last October. No specific recommendations (we found a 3BD/2BA house west of Main to rent off Zillow), but can share a few observations:\n\n1) The rental market here absolutely ebbs and flows with the student population, so most leases run from August through May or August. If you\u2019re able to find one outside of that window, you can often negotiate a better deal. \n\n2) There\u2019s basically two rental companies in town that run the market: Mecca and Greenbriar, and then a few smaller players like John Newlove, Almar, and Mid-Am. \n\n3) Don\u2019t know if you have a pet, but finding a rental that will accept one was especially difficult. FWIW, I negotiated a \u201cpet fee\u201d into a \u201cpet deposit\u201d. \n\n4) If I was a student and didn\u2019t have a dog, I\u2019d look for a 1BD/1BA apt on Main St. IIRC, you could find something for like $700/mo. Forget the apartment gym amenities you see at other places, the BGSU campus has an excellent rec center with gym, pool, fitness classes, etc. and living on Main would put you close to coffee shops and restaurants, while still being walkable to campus.",

            "comment": "From an alumni of BGSU, here are some suggestions: \n\nTry to find graduate housing. There was one particular apartment complex I can recall (not the name of) that was only for masters students and above. \n\nDO NOT rent through Greenbriar under ANY circumstance. They have a monopoly over BG student housing so they know they can do whatever they want. \n\nIf you choose not to live in Bowling Green, Maumee, Perrysberg, Waterville, etc. are all good options. I personally have never lived here so I can\u2019t offer much advice, but I\u2019ve heard good things.",

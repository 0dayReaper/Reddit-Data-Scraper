Old Town Buffet is pretty good, the cuisine is Americanized to some extent but the food tastes really great. \n\nYaya Kitchen is legit Chinese food in Perrysburg. About 15 minutes drive north of BG across from Levis Commons.\n\nWithin Levis Commons there's a restaurant called Tea Tree that is phenomenal but pricey. They're marketed as an \"Asian Bistro\" so they have a little bit of Korean and Japanese bit their Chinese food and Sushi are the best in the area.",

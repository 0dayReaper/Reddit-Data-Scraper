It was a really fun night when I went down there, and because they house hot steam pipes, it stays warm all year round. When I went in, there was one hatch that was left slightly open but I'm sure they keep closer tabs on them now. This was also ~17 years ago.",

The first one to close was because the tunnel underneath it was in danger of collapsing to car traffic.  I would guess that they simply are not maintained enough for regular use.",

It gets really hot in the tunnels, and they're narrow, and some of the pipes are scalding hot, so it's really not fun to go down there. If you have an above ground buddy you won't get lost, but still not really worth it.",

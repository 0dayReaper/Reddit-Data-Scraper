Ive had extreme triumphs, and extreme failures to where I\u2019ve even had to move back with my mom for while. \n\nNow I just turned 30. Fuck. Just starting to get my shit together. It\u2019s hard out there man. Enjoy school and don\u2019t fuck it away.  Take some time to walk around town and stuff at night. It\u2019s a neat place , and a place that thousands have had memories at. \n\n\nI\u2019m fucked up right now but you get what I\u2019m saying. I fucking fell in love there. Now I\u2019m an asshole with a dog.Insane. \n\nI used to live in Campbell hill haha Is that still a thing ?",

Being young and dumb was fun in it's own way, but now we got another kind of fun. \n\nBeing at BG was some absolutely great times and I almost tear up just thinking about those days. Absolutely to any student out there--get out and enjoy your time there, however you define enjoy. Drink/Dont Drink, Keg Party or Mario Party, whatever you do, do it well and enjoy it. These years don't last forever, make them count.",

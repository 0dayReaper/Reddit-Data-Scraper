There are a couple groups such as the Queer Trans Student Union and Queer Literature Club. There\u2019s also the Multicultural Greek Council and UMSO which is a religious group that\u2019s very inclusive! I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more that I\u2019m missing and I may not be the best person to answer your question, but these are some of the things that have been most apparent to me on campus!",

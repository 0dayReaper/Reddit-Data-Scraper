    "postText": "Hey everyone, I am looking for someone to sublease at my Field Manor apartment on Frazee Avenue from the end of May when school gets out until August 2020.  You will be living with three others in a 4 bedroom apartment with your own bathroom.  Rent is $340.50/month + utilities. May rent will be paid off, so you will only have to pay June/July. If you have any questions or want more information, please contact me.",

You need to purchase a separate membership to use the wall but lot of the outdoor program staff hang out there and the regulars at the wall are super friendly and always looking to expand our friend group! Feel free to PM if you want to connect!",

They even host a wilderness first responder course. You might be able to meet some people through here once the semester kicks off.\n\nhttps://www.bgsu.edu/recwell/outdoor-program.html",

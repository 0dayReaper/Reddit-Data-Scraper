    "postText": "Me and my roommate found a fantastic house that we have been living in for the past month, And now we need you, a third roommate to partake in our silly shenanigans! The house is quite spacious and large, we have two whole floors and a gigantic kitchen to cook in. I'm a righteous cook by the way. But that is besides the point, rent is $225 + utilities. The address is 535 south maple street apt a. Where a little bit of a walk to campus. PM me for additional details.",

Oh and whats that smell... just some motherfucking fresh baked [bread](http://i.imgur.com/yLAvz). Even if you're not interested pass this along to a friend who maybe is. ",

            "comment": "I'm late to the thread, but I wanted to point out that before COVID-19 happened, the campus network was being upgraded. These upgrades in part, called for an upgrade to wireless access points across campus. These upgrades would have featured network segmentation support, which would let you use Chromecasts and other local streaming solutions in your residence hall room (Currently a PITA &amp; Discouraged). \n\nI don't know if that's still the plan or not. COVID-19 has necessitated a lot of changes. (ITS lost 16 staff members and 4 full time employees due to budget issues)\n\nFor anything that supports it, ethernet is still the way to go as others have said. You'll have to register the MAC address of your device with ITS before it can connect to the network. Make sure you grab the MAC of the Ethernet controller, and not the WLAN controller if one is present. \n\nOther BGSU Computing tips.\n\n* If you don't have a smartphone, or want an absolutely minimalist phone setup, DUO can work with a physical token for 2 factor authentication.\n\n* Make a spreadsheet of your devices and include a photo and serial number of each, then store it in a few locations on the cloud. Theft isn't really a big issue in BG, but the police are more likely to be able to do something with solid info they can act on.\n\n* Back your stuff up. BACK YOUR STUFF UP. Keep an external drive at home or use the university provided onedrive account. You get 1TB of storage for free through that. Professors don't play around with lost work.\n\n* Don't pay for MS Office or windows, since you are eligible for free legitimate versions of both through university partnerships. Don't use shady software.\n\n* You can set up Outlook to filter mail by sender, which is really handy for segmenting your inbox by topic. I personally just keep anything immediately actionable in my inbox, send old emails that I may need to reference to the archive folder (built in), and delete anything that is no longer needed/junk (Helps speed up searches for things I actually care about).\nMost people will just have a giant inbox of every email ever and that's fine too. Don't waste time optimising something if you don't think it works for you.\n\n* If you want to learn GNU/Linux you can request access to the university Linux server and SSH in. No VMs or dual booting on your own machine required.\n\n* Check the library ebook collections for your textbook. You may get lucky (Don't count on it though).\n\n* Check out the student orgs on Presence. You've mentioned gaming in some of the responses on this thread, and I can vouch that there are quite a few gaming and nerd culture orgs. The fall 2020 season includes Super Smash Brothers. There's a few Melee players still lugging their CRTs to campus, but I think most have gone on to ultimate at this point.\n\n* You can get free wordpress blogs from blogs.bgsu.edu, but it's kind of janky.\n\n* Download the starship app and make the robots bring you stuff. The $2 fee sucks, but it's better then getting sick in a crowded space.",

Also thanks for all the tips too! I really appreciate it :) \n\nI have a couple comments on the tips\n\n* I've always wondering how DUO would work without a mobile device. The push, call, and text all go to your phone, so it's good to know if I lose my phone, I can still use DUO.\n* I already have a list of all my electronics saved and everything backed up :)\n* I already torrented MS Office, oops\n* I don't understand people who don't filter their emails. I keep on getting OCM emails sent to my spam. It doesn't really impact me, but it's still annoying :/\n* I've already been in contact with the BG esports org! I'm super excited to play with them since I've never really had an opportunity to play competitively with anyone in person. Also I'm glad to hear there are some Melee nerds with their CRTs LOL. I don't actually play Melee, but I love watching people play it. I mostly play Ultimate.\n* I'm gonna spend *a lot* of money using starship, especially in the winter!",

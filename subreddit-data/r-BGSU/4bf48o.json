    "postText": "Hey, so I'm new here, what would you say I need to wear to iNation so as not to get charged a cover charge? I really own almost nothing that's black. (I'm a guy.) The best I can do is dark navy jeans and a charcoal gray t-shirt but it has an American Eagle logo so that's not going to fly either. I'm going to have to hit up a mall or Old Navy or something and I can't spend a lot, so let's just call this my \"starter\" wardrobe for iNation and I'll do better in the weeks or months ahead. So maybe a plain charcoal gray hoodie and a pair of black cargo pants or shorts? I honestly have no idea. And I can't envision myself wearing all black, but if that's what you suggest I'll go for it. I just want to have fun and be part of something cool on a Wednesday night and not have to pay a $15 cover. Thanks.",

You don't need much.\n\nThe attic does country night on the same day as iNation. I think the cover charge thing is to keep the good ol' boys out.",

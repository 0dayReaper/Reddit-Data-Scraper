Former president of Japanese Club and fluent Japanese speaker here. \n\nI currently live in Asia, so I can't tutor you, but I can put out a message to my contacts to see if any of them still live in or around BG. \n\nI'll be in BG for homecoming next weekend as well, so perhaps I'll be able to meet some people then who would be interested.

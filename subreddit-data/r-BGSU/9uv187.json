I've read a lot of BGSU is \"Bar SCene\" but I'm wondering if there is a big Greek life scene and lots of \"house parties\" as I'm def gonna rush a Frat and I saw the Greek Village on my tour. Are there usually house parties and Frat parties on weekends that freshman can go to easily? Like are parties easy to go to?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

If you know the frat you can get in, some charge a cover fee. Frats here are pretty good, Delta Khi, Alpha Tau Omega, Pike are some good ones. I hope this clarified anything you were looking for. If you have any questions I am well versed among the frats. You can reply or PM me.",

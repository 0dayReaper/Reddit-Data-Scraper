            "comment": "From my experience working for residence life, it is more of a benefit to live where your community is rather than live somewhere else. I will say that kohl shall has one of the best overall building communities on campus compared to the halls that have air conditions. Weather in bg is really only hot until about october when you can finally close the windows. You get used to the temps fairly quick. I will also say that living in a different hall than your learning community. Sometimes getting access to the spaces you are allowed to use can be a pain if the desk staff and hall staff is not on top of getting all the PEDs that students need. \n\nKohl hall may have small rooms and no air conditioning but the benefits of leaving the doors open and getting to know the people around you far outweigh the 2.5 months of eat you'll experience.",

The perks of having your peers and likely classes and meeting in the dorm will probably outweigh the slight inconveniences you mentioned. \n\nAlso I was in Kohl hall-I can\u2019t believe they haven\u2019t torn it down yet but it is a blast",

The air conditioning isn't noticable as most of the year bowling Green is colder. So I would say give Kohl a try it's actually a great dorm and community inside the dorm.",

However, everyone had their door open and I met pretty much all of my friends I\u2019ve kept all year either through Kreischer or in Kreischer. Other guys I know who lived in places like centennial didn\u2019t know their neighbors, and I knew pretty much everyone in all floors of Darrow. I lived in falcon sophomore year and never saw my neighbors once",

I know back in the day they used to stop at 5, but I don't know if they work later now.\n\nEdit: I just bit the bullet and bought a pass.",

So like not having a student parking pass and parking at overman even after student passes are allowed, you\u2019d get a ticket. \nAlso if you\u2019re completely violating parking, say, sitting in a Offenhauer turnaround for more than half an hour, the campus security officers will be dispatched to write a ticket or tow the car",

Overnight the student security can still ticket you if you\u2019re parked somewhere you\u2019re not supposed to be, but they don\u2019t check for permits like parking services does.",

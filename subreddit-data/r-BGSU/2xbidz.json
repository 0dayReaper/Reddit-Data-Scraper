It also says under Eligibility \"Services offered by the Counseling Center (with the exception of mandated alcohol and drug education programs) are free to all enrolled BGSU students.\" \n\nContact information for their office is:\n104 College Park Office Building\nBowling Green State University\nBowling Green, OH 43403\nPhone: 419-372-2081\n",

I can reach out to some of my former professors if you need help or you can PM me with any questions. I'm not LGBT, but I have plenty of friends who are and I can find you an answer to anything you might need to know.",

From what I understand if you're taking at least 1 credit hour with the college, the service should be provided for free, but I'm not 100% sure. Give them a call bathe receptionist there is the nicest person I've met. ",

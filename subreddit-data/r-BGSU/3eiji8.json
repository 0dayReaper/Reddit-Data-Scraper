The side panel image has also been changed because the stadium picture was getting a little old. If anyone else has any other suggestions for the subreddit please let us know.",

I think with small subs the content needs to be driven from the top in order to get people interested and participating. \n\nDuring sports seasons if we could get links to game streams/info and scores/game threads it would be awesome. I live on the other side of the world so it can be hard to keep up with all of the news. \n\nAlso notices alerting people of updates like concerts, events, sibs n kids, homecoming, etc. Would be great. Maybe have them in the sidebar? (note: I'm a mobile user, so maybe that's already there?) ",

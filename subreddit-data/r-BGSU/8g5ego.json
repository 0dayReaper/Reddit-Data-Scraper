We\u2019ve been asking around, and are having no luck. If anyone has an extra ticket, please PM me. If it comes down to it, I\u2019ll probably end up giving mine away, but I want to be there for the biggest day of her life. ",

I\u2019m grabbing my ticket from her the day of or I\u2019d have a better description. I was trying to surprise her a bit so I didn\u2019t ask too many details ",

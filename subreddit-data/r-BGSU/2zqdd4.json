I know personally I have found my two favorite rental homes by complete accident and had never heard of the company before moving in. I will add the places I know of, but please feel free to comment with rental companies you have rented from/heard of. We can also do a little bit of review in the comments hopefully! I have only added a few for now, I will add to this more as I can.",

Greenbrair for example, allows pets in about 12 of their 120 or so properties and only allow a single pet regardless of weight or type.

Pets allowed with deposit and rent increase. \n\nWinthrop/Summit Terrace (http://www.investekmanagement.com/wintrhop-terrace-bg/winthrop-terrace-bg/) Rented from them once, would not recommend. Most utilities were included, including basic tv/internet, obviously having the drawback that you are paying for those services regardless of whether you want them or would rather have a different provider. Not sure about pets. The leasing manager at the time I rented (a few years ago now, so possibly now a different person) once made racist remarks in my presence (not directed at me). It was pretty uncomfortable. \n\n",

It's actually the only place I've lived in BG where I've renewed my lease on the same apartment for a second year. \n\nIt has on-site laundry, and the rental office is in the building, so that's pretty convenient. Possible drawbacks are that there's only one parking space allotted to each apartment, so if you have two people with vehicles, one has to find alternative parking.\n\nI get the impression that it's a mix of students and non-students that live here. It's generally pretty quiet, both in the actual building and for being downtown. (Occasionally you hear people being a little loud leaving the bars on the weekend, but it feels like a very minor disturbance compared to places closer to campus.)\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!

No AC kinda sucked and the building is old, but you lived with people who either majored in or were highly interested in the arts. They had lots of cool activities and classes and programs that you could all do together. 10+ years later and I\u2019m still friends with people I met my first year in the AV. (don\u2019t know why I\u2019m still on this sub, but whatever)",

There's a real soul about Kreischer in my experience because everyone bonds over being stuck in the \"shitty dorm\" as it were. A lot of genuine people there. My sophomore year I lived in Offenhauer and it was not the same at all.",

Things were way more communal back then, and standards were a bit lower for quality of life features. It hasn't aged the best, and it's the most plain residence hall on campus, but it's not destitute living either. Even though it's close getting to the library is mildly annoying since you have to walk around the building to get in (There used to be a shortcut, but it's been demolished).\n\nKreischer does have some perks. It has it's own dining hall (Only open for dinner), convenience store (Open morning to night). It's also the closest residence hall to the music building (Go to concerts), theater building (Go to plays), Ice Arena, Football Stadium, and rec center (Dodge the weight gain). The walk to parking lot 12 (The biggest one) from Kreisher is moderately inconvenient compared to majorly inconvenient for other residence halls. It's also really close to the art building (Check out the gallery). Everything else is a bit further, but there's nowhere on campus you can't leisurely walk to in about 20 minutes or so.",

It's also relatively far from the \"hub\" of campus (like 10 minute walk). Another small thing is that most of the drinking fountains are pretty terrible, so you might have to go to the lobby to get decent water.",

No AC\n\nof course there are others including: **Centenial, Conklin, Falcon heights (kind of an apartment style) ,and kohl halls**\n\nI don't know too much about these, only that conklin is similar to Mcdonald so expect similar things and that falcon heights is more an like an apartment complex than a dorm\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, these are my experiences so things could be different for you",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! A good friend of mine has been working tirelessly to set up and spread the word for an event he set up for his fraternity, and I am here to help support him and try and spread the word. This Sunday the 11th on the Bowling Green campus, some of the top Ohio State Buckeyes football players will be doing guest speaking and photo op/meet n greets. This is a great chance to meet them for a good price and on top of that all proceeds from ticket sales will be going to the iamstonefoltz foundation. Spread the word or stop by if you can :)\n\nhttps://app.registrationguru.net/#!/portal?eventId=83e2397b-7ab5-4c1a-b884-8bfda4d5700d\n\nHere is the link but also visit ksbgsu on instagram for more info",

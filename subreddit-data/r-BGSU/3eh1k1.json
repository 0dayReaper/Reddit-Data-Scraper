Yes? *GREAT!* **Here's your chance to host live pub trivia for Sporcle!**\n\nSporcle is searching for responsible, friendly, engaging, entertaining folks to host pub trivia in Napoleon *and* Findlay!\n\nOur ideal host has a clear, strong speaking voice on a microphone that they use to command the attention of a gathering of jovial beer-fueled trivia. Basic computer skills, ability to multi-task, and quick wit are also crucial. **Hosts must be at least 21 years old.** \n\nWe supply our hosts with the questions and equipment they need to host. Hosts provide a laptop/tablet for scoring, some great tunes, and a great personality to keep teams coming back each week.\n\nThis is an excellent way to ditch your pjs, meet new people, and earn extra cash. **Our hosts earn $50-$75 for each show**, depending on how many players are involved. OK, so you won't be on TV for this gig, but you would have a chance to be locally famous with your players!\n\n[Apply right now!](http://Sporcle.com/jobs)",

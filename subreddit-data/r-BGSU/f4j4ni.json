            "comment": "I went to OU for a year and transferred to be closer to family and activities. Both aren't bad choices. They offer different atmospheres.\n\n\nOU is a heavy party school. It's in the middle of nowhere, but if you like nature it can be fun to hike around. Columbus is about an hour away and is the closest major city. You can take a bus there. Also, it's very hilly. If you live at the bottom of the hill and walk to classes you'll probably gain some leg and booty muscle by the end of the sem. The school has a very \"quintessential party school\" vibe. In fact, the school is *extremely* party focused and was once ranked #1 party school in the US years back. Expect to experience some interesting townies and drunken people. I turned to a dark alley once and saw some old man sniffing cocaine lol. Still, I had some good nights.\n\n\nBG has slightly smaller undergrad population and there are cities and other attractions close by. If you want slightly less \"craziness\" BG has a good balance of party/work atmosphere. People like to party here and it's definitely a party school but we don't go as far as breaking out police on horses to keep things in order. There are good local food options and coffee spots. Probably a bit more undergrad job opportunities as well. As for going in for science ed? Well good news because half of my friends here are ed majors for a reason. BG is known for it. I'm not one myself though. It is flat here so it can get pretty windy. Our mascot should change to bunnies or geese because weve got an overpopulation of them lol. \n\n\nYou'll probably thrive regardless of which you choose, so don't overthink it. If you have any more questions about either school lemme know.",

            "comment": "You ok with snow? How about hills? How much do you plan on partying?\n\nI do enjoy OU to visit, I went down for a halloween and to visit my fraternity and some concerts at Jackie O's. It can still feel like a huge party school. The freshman dorms are old AF and it's quite a walk to some parts of campus and uphill at times. All you really have to shop is walmart but there are some pretty good mexican restaurants to get out to. My sister liked it but transferred to BG where I was after a year and a half.\n\nI personally prefer BG. It is freaking cold at times but it's flat. Campus is pretty well confined to a walkable area and downtown isn't that far of a walk either. My favorite spot to live was in the neighborhood between campus and downtown (shout out to 310 E. Merry). You will never run out of pizza options and like other suggested you don't have to drive as far to get pretty much any restaurant you want because Toledo isn't too far away.\n\nBoth BG and OU have reputable education degrees but I would argue for BG and Kent over OU. Kent sucks, i transferred from there. Another option on the table is Eastern Michigan who has a better education program and doesn't (or didn't?) charge out of state tuition.",

Schools will look at that degree and it'll look really good for you. \n\nBut. \n\nThe College of Education and Human Development is an absolute fucking disaster. Nobody knows what's happening at any given moment. My academic advisors were useless at best and wasted my time at worst. There were times when they outright forgot about prerequisites and corequisites and I had to spend the first week of the semester sorting my schedule out. \n\nIn addition, the curriculum claims to be evidence based but that's hokey bullshit. A lot of the teaching methods I was taught were simply impractical for everyday classroom use on account of how little time teachers in the real world have for this sort of thing. I've even heard of higher-up professors advising students \"I know this isn't how it works in the real world, just do the assignments and keep your head down\" or something to that effect. \n\nFinally, don't join the learning communities based around teaching. There's been too much drama, and it'll suck up all your time. Go out and make friends outside of your major, for your own sake.",

I was a STEM major. With the exception of biochem, I really enjoyed all my classes. So on the science end of things, also pretty good. It's easy to make friends and it's easy to find part time work if you want. It's a great school. I highly recommend.",

    "postText": "The Bowling Green Roller Hockey League is currently looking for new players. Games are played at the BG City park on a concrete surface and with a roller hockey puck. Games are played at a competitive recreational level and players are required to wear at minimum skates, gloves, a helmet and of course use a stick.\n\nThe season consists of ten regular season games and potentially three playoff games. Many teams need additional spots so free agents as well as full teams are welcome.\n\nEach team consists of eight skaters and one goalie. Games are played four on four.\n\nThe cost for registration for skaters is $80. The cost for goalies is as always, free.\n\nFor more details visit our website http://www.bgrollerhockey.org and be sure to \"like\" Bowling Green Roller Hockey on Facebook! ",

Referees specifically we'd prefer have experience but if you own a pair of roller blades, know about hockey and have a willingness to learn it would be a nice to way to make well over minimum wage.",

Its really all about having a positive attitude and playing with the right team. Some teams take it more serious than others. Also physical contact is as limited as possible to keep players safe. \n\nIf you have any further questions feel free to shoot me an email and I'll answer them for you: bgrollerhockey@gmail.com",

    "postText": "Hello everyone. I am moving to BGSU next semester for graduate school and was wondering if anyone had any recommendations or tips. I looked at most of the off campus housing resources but I still have some questions. Are there any studios that are not listed online? Any cheap places that could have heating and electricity included in the rent? Are there any on campus options that are worth it for grads?",

Also it is less than 10 mins from the BGSU shuttle route though in the winter it my as well be an hour. But it's more than suitable.... and if you have a car, it's perfect.",

Rent is pretty cheap (split 3 ways) and it's not super close to campus/downtown, but it doesn't feel out of the way. So you don't get the noise from the downtown scene and also don't feel like you're out in the middle of nowhere.",

They have specific graduate and family housing options that have some stricter rules on noise, parties, and are generally nicer units. The office is also super great to work with and I had most maintenance issues taken care of within 24 hours. Look at summit terrace as well. The units are good and it is in a very quiet part of town. The new management company kind of sucks but the ammentities are with the price. There is also Stadium View Apartments close to the highway. They are similar to summit terrace in price.  Avoid Newlove, John Newlove (different from Newlove), Greenbriar, and falcons point or The Edge.",

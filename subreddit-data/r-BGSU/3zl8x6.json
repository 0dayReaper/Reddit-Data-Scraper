    "postText": "2016 is going to be our year. I want to gather everyone in a 10 mile radius interested in making music. I live right outside of campus in Campbell hill.\n\nIf you have ever had a desire to produce music, message me.\nWhether you rap, sing, play the trombone, piano, the electric triangle, or know a bit about sound engineering.\nId like to gather everyone to help with networking, feedback, and that oh so good encouragement. \n\nI'm currently working on a Chillwave/Hiphop album, if anyone is [interested,](https://soundcloud.com/youngster-siddhartha-joey/creme-de-menthe)\nand I of course would love to hear some of your work and ideas.\n\nDon't let your dreams be dreams.\nLet your new years resolutions be 1080P not 240P.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, my younger brother will be a freshman this fall and I\u2019m a little nervous for him. \n\nHe is coming in undecided. I always thought he would lean towards business, but as a business major myself at another school I\u2019m not sure about the math classes with it &amp; accounting. Any business majors here and the challenges with it? Or someone who really likes their major?\n\nAre there any other majors represented on here that can speak to why they like it? He would need a program that you don\u2019t need to apply for anything within it if that makes sense. I couldn\u2019t see him doing something in science, although he LOVES nature and animals (we have housed 6+ wild animals over the course of his childhood.)\n\nAlso, he has orientation coming up in 2 or so weeks. I am nervous for him to schedule classes. Any tips with that? Can I go back and look at what he picked and possibly make edits with him before the semester starts? I know someone will be assisting him with this there but wasn\u2019t sure how much attention he will get and how invested they will be in helping him make smart choices. \n\nLastly, any tips for a student athlete at BG? \n\nTHANK YOU to any and all help! Feel free to add something that doesn\u2019t relate to a question I asked - all advice welcome :) ",

I waited for a very long time and then it turned out that the person I was to meet with wasn't there. Someone else came to help me. They were nice enough but I got scheduled for at least one class that I shouldn't have bothered with. You could always tell him to get an appointment with a real advisor. My advisor has been very helpful in getting me in the classes I need and staying away from the ones I don't.\n\nAs for major, I am Computer Science. There are a lot of CS majors on campus so there's almost always someone around who can help you in some way.",

            "comment": "Just as the other commenter has said, at his SOAR date an advisor will help him schedule classes. For spring semester, he will have to meet with his advisor (a different one I\u2019m guessing) again to help schedule classes. Advisors are helpful if you reach out to them! Nothing to be nervous about. As long as he has an idea of what he\u2019s doing (initially with BG perspective courses) then he\u2019ll most likely find a major that interests him! I believe there are special courses for undecided majors specifically designed to help pick a career path! I just graduated from BG with an English degree and I\u2019m coming back to BG in the fall for my Masters program! ",

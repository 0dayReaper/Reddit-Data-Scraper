Having a car, I didn't have to wait for family to pick me up. I got to drive anywhere when I wanted to. I also worked so I could afford the pass. I used my car about once every one or two weeks.",

If you happen to be an education major, you might need one to go to field experience, yes even freshman year. Otherwise Toledo is only 20 minutes away (and yes it is not all bad), Detroit is 1 hour and Columbus and Cleveland are both 2 hours, which make for easy weekend trips. The shuttle goes to Meijer sometimes if you are stressed about that, but it also goes right to the parking lot so your car is always only a bus ride away. Hope that helps :)",

The bus goes to the grocery but if you want more than you can carry a car helps. Also the stores on campus have a few things but they are basically glorified convient stores. So if you want something super specific you may be out of luck. \n\n",

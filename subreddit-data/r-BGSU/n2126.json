Toledo Museum of Art is very nice, and they have one of the best glass museums in the world.\n\nDo they love hot dogs? Tony Paco's. Grilled sausage with spicy chili in a bun with Hungarian dumplings and pickled peppers on the side. 'Nuff said. (go to the original location on Front St.)\n\nAnn Arbor is a pretty great little town, lots to do, Jolly Pumpkin brewery is there. Just a little over an hour away.",

Reverends and City Tap have a really good selection of beer, but for food I suggest Reverends over CT. I'm not really sure what type of bar you are into for going out on a Friday night, some I avoid because the crowd is younger (18-20) but I'm also not in that age bracket anymore lol. My suggestion is to just do a bar crawl until you find a place you like. There aren't many places that have a cover charge (except Howards and Nate and Wallys if there are bands playing) so you won't be out anything if you hate the place.",

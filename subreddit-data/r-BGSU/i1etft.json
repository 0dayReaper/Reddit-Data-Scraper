Some of it is going toward scholarships, which is nice, but mostly for business students :/ Since I'm not majoring in business, I feel kinda left out tbh. BG advertised it as a \"transformative gift to all students\", but it's not going to impact me one bit.",

I think that donors shouldn't be able to unilaterally decide what their money is going to do once they give a certain amount (because then you're just buying mass influence), so either the donors should take it upon themselves to not do that, or the laws in Ohio concerned donors should dis-allow that. You may think it's a good thing, other things equal, that people donate to universities, but if you're only donating to an already supported subset of the university, then it's like starting a charity just for middle class americans.",

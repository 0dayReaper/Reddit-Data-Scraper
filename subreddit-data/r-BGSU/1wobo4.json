    "postText": "I was admitted to BGSU in the fall semester of 2012. I was a creative writing major. I'm not from Ohio, and absolutely no one from my high school, or any of those surrounding me, went to BG. In fact, I was told that it had been 20+ years since the last person from my hometown had gone to BGSU.\n\nI was scared. I was alone. I was nervous. These are emotions all college freshman experience. However, all of these feelings were intensified by the fact that I knew absolutely no one. I went in with the mindset that I would be a loner, and focus on my school work. I had no intentions of making friends. I didn't think that was what college was about. I believed that, for me at least, college was the era of all work and no play. The Falcons changed that mindset.\n\nWithin four hours of moving into my dorm, I was already friends with my roommate, who happened to have the same first name as me. We seemed to have so much in common, and what we didn't have in common, we bonded over. Within a week, I was friends with a good portion of his friends from high school. After two weeks, I branched off, and became part of a group of five or six guys and girls, some that lived on my floor (Offenhauer West, go floor six!), and some that lived all across campus. Within a month, I had established a strong core group of friends, and had even started considering Phi Gamma Delta, aka Fiji. While I didn't end up becoming a brother, the gentlemen in that fraternity continued long into the future to provide friendship and support to me. (If you are looking into joining a fraternity, I would strongly suggest Fiji. Even though I'm not a 'typical frat guy', I felt like I fit in with these gentlemen.) \n\nI recently had some medical issues, and have had to leave Bowling Green, for good. I'm hoping to go back to school, but it will have to be closer to home for me. The whole point of this ridiculously long post, is that I want to thank you, Falcons, for providing me with one of the best years of my life. Even when things were tough, even when things were dismal, even when everything threatened to collapse around me, my fellow Falcons kept me afloat, and provided me with the strength I needed to carry on. Even though it was only a little over a year, my time at BGSU will stay with me forever. Thank you, Falcons, for being so Falcon awesome. Roll along. \n\n\nTL;DR: Despite my short stay, the Falcons made my life amazing.",

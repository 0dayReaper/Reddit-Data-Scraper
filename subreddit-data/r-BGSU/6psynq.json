He's not very reddit-savvy, I told him I would check here for him.\n\n\nHe would like to meet twice a week (maybe 3 times?) and help him review class work, keep him accountable for homework and help prep for exams. \n\nI know there are tutors provided by the University, but he's looking for consistent, one-on-one tutoring with regular hours. \n\n\nKnow anyone who'd be interested?",

Do that first because your brother is already paying for it with his tuition and fees. If he needs more than can be provided, go to the TAs or SIs for the 1000-level classes, and they will probably do one-on-ones too, for free.",

The biggest here in town are Mecca Management, Greenbriar, John Newlove, Preferred Properties, and MidAm management. I lease with Mecca and have a great experience but I have some friends who haven't liked them very much. I've heard only bad things about Greenbriar. Newlove has some of the lowest prices but also some of the shittiest properties. \n\nSeriously consider living in an apartment that's converted from part of a house. That will get you closest to campus at the lowest price. If you wind up in Falcon's Landing (the university grad housing) it's not the end of the world. Everyone I know who lives there is cool it's just way too expensive.",

Areas like liberty street, Evers, even right on Main Street . The town is basically split up into high turnover areas ( east of main, # streets), and more stable local areas ( west of main )  West of main is mostly all local people, professors, grads, etc.There are some cool big old houses divided up if you are living alone. I've rented from Greenbriar and yeah renting sucks at times, especially from companies that deal with students non stop, but usually everything is ok. Newlove doesn't rent to undergrads. Call around, I'm sure you'll find a good spot. There are a few gems, and everything is pretty inexpensive. Feel free to pm me if you have questions, good luck!\n",

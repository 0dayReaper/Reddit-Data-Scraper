I hope these allegations and praying for everyone involved, the poor kids shouldn\u2019t have to go through this. It\u2019s a shame too because I actually got a chance to talk to him at the BG Football game this fall and seemed like such a great guy. \nNot to mention, he has a promising future in the league. It would be a shame if all of his hard work went down the drain. \nOur program has our own problems we need to address.\n\ud83e\udd85\ud83e\udd85\ud83e\udd85\ud83e\udd85\ud83e\udd85\ud83e\udd85",

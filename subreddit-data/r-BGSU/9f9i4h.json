    "postText": "My family will be in town this coming weekend and will begin the process of looking for an apartment for my now sophomore daughter. I am of the persuasion that looking away from campus might be cheaper and a better deal. I also understand that the leases near campus come at a 9 month lease. Just looking for graduates and current students who have started the struggle to find the right place at all the different factor to possibly give me a crash course in what to expect for my fun weekend. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.\n\nJust a small Update for all involved in helping me with tons of comments: I survived the weekend with only touring two apartments and can tell you that I was not prepared. I ended up in a hotel room with two double beds, and a couch pull out bed with my wife, two younger teens, and a small needy dog. On the bright side they all survived too...",

Only gripe I have with them is if you need any maintenance done it takes em a while to actually get to you. Just had to call and yell at em today because my toilet had a leak but they just ended up canceling my maintenance request after three weeks. I called back and they said they\u2019d have someone out by the end of the month. I told them that\u2019s unacceptable and if they couldn\u2019t get someone out by the end of the week I might have to call a lawyer. Maintenance showed up 10 minutes later. Other than that though pretty nice place. Get a huge condo style apartment for relatively cheap rent per month. Only have to pay electricity and water. Get cable and internet included. Overall satisfied just a little angry with the leasing office but it\u2019ll blow over. Other friends I have here said they\u2019ve had no problems whatsoever, maybe I\u2019m just on the shit list. Definitely recommend though, might be resigning the lease. ",

            "comment": "My best friend and I rented from Mecca for three years. For a two bedroom apartment, which was really a house split by the levels, it was about $450. House was ancient, no AC, but close to campus. It was ideal for myself, who was both a biology and computer science student, and I really liked it. It was a bad place for my roommate, who was an English/Psychology major. (Buildings are located in different areas, depending on the major and the major's main office location.) At the end of it, we got nearly all of our deposit back, except for $75 for not getting the carpets cleaned. Mecca allows for full year leases as well, as they seem to appeal to more than student housing.\n\nMy friend then got a place from Newlove. Both Mecca and Newlove were very responsive when it came to maintenance. Her apartment had a lot of space for very cheap. However, she has mixed feelings about them now, since she just moved out a month ago and they took all of her security deposit and then some on things that made no sense.\n\nAnyway, that's my experience. Falcon's Pointe always looks like dorms. but they have a shuttle. Copper Beach tends to be homier but way further from campus, but they also have a shuttle. My friend had a fairly good experience with a house from Greenbriar on S College Dr. so I think they are decent too.",

I\u2019m looking for a place to buy cheap BGSU T-shirts or sweatshirts.  \n\nI\u2019ve been to Elite Collegiate (GREAT place for higher quality stuff), but the only place I could find cheap gear is the Meijers out east of 75.  \n\nAny suggestions would help.  Thanks!",

I\u2019ve also seen some stuff on ebay before too. The campus apparel store in the union also had some decent discount racks when I was an undergrad",

            "comment": "&gt;best wages/flexibility\n\nPick one, because that is what you get.\n\nFor best wages, it\u2019s off campus jobs. I can\u2019t give you exact places, because I don\u2019t know where everywhere pays, but just look on Indeed or the BGSU student employment listings. But these jobs generally have different schedules every week and sometimes, they aren\u2019t accommodating when they screw it up for you. \n\nFor best schedules, it\u2019s on campus jobs. Most on campus jobs have you working the exact same schedule every week because they schedule around your class schedule. They also alternate weekends. For example, every week, you work Mondays and Wednesdays, 7am-11am and then every other Saturday and Sunday, you work 10am-2pm. Plus, they completely change the schedule around when exams come around. The issue is that it\u2019s not flexible, so if something comes up, you\u2019ll be in the same situation as the other jobs \u2013 having to find someone to cover you\n\nQuick edit: I worked for dining services for about four years. I personally loved it but I'm a busy body and I got to be a supervisor after my second year. If you work more than 4 hours, you get a meal card that cuts prices in half, so you can live on the bronze plan. You work with people who aren't just students. You do more than just sit around. But, for lazier jobs, there's desk positions where you kind of just sit around and watch a computer lab or wait for people to ask you questions.",

The shifts are between 3-4.5 hours. We get paid for our travel time to go to a local elementary school and help 2nd graders practice their reading. The kids are hilarious &amp; the teachers plan everything out for us. It's a ton of fun and you don't have to be an education major or anything.",

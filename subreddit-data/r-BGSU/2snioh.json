I can't speak much for the graduate program though.\n\nAs /u/kplis said Toledo is pretty close and theres some cool things that happen there as well as cool bars. The Ottawa Tavern, The Attic, etc. There is Frankies for shows as well as The OT puts on shows pretty often. BG has a really good night life when school is in session although the bars can get old after a few times out and about. ",

Do people go to Toledo? Nah, not really\u2026 you aren't missing much, Bowling Green is a slice of heaven in Lucas/Wood counties. Lots of great restaurants, booze is cheap, and there are 21 and up bars you can go to in order to avoid undergrads. I lived in the \"thick of the jungle\" my entire stay there (Merry and Enterprise) and the noise of the undergrads never really bothered me\u2026 close to campus and bars, BG is super walkable and bikeable in general. I love BG and would recommend it to anyone. Also, if you decide to become a Falcon.. GO TO MR SPOTS. ",

I still know a decent amount of people there.\n\nIt really depends on what program you are there for to give recommendations. I will say this, either live on the west side of town or do what I did and live in perrysburg. The undergrads really do little less besides constantly drink and wreck havoc. It has become progressively worse over the years and after a while I was sick of my car being messed with and other drunken mishaps. \n\nThe only thing to really do is drink in this town and I welcome the down votes but it is true. I taught for two years and the undergrads really do not care much else besides trying to get a passing grade after only showing up to class every so often. Toledo is in the middle of becoming better in parts but it is a rather dull town with exception to the downtown bar scene and the museum. There are lots of malls though...\n\nThe biggest concern you should be worried about is funding. The university is constantly slashing budgets and cutting faculty especially in the sciences. This will concern you because unless you are funded exclusively by your advisor and not the department your funding could be cut because you technically have to reapply every year in some programs. My program lost summer funding starting this coming summer.",

The secure network requires you to sign in only once, where as the standard network requires daily sign in. A lot of people assume the secure network must be for staff only, but students are free to use it as well.",

Being from Akron, I was very apprehensive coming in because I, too, was worried about the change from urban to rural and that I would be bored out here.  However, I am now a third year and couldn't be happier.  The community of students and faculty here are consistently welcoming wherever I go and it really adds to the quality of going here.  Plus BG actually has a lot of well-kept secrets in terms of fun places to go in town.  I would absolutely recommend it!  Go Falcons!",

            "comment": "I'm not still in BG, but I went there for undergrad a few years ago. I grew up in Cincinnati, and while I didn't live downtown, I certainly had access to all of the amenities that a city offered, so it was a weird change moving to BG.\n\nI really love the town. It may not seem like much, but there is enough there. Being in a small town was a nice change of pace for me, everything just seemed a little more relaxed. My friends and I did go up to Toledo every once in a while but not too often. Its close enough that its not a pain. We would go up for shopping, concerts and minor league sporting events. The main limitation of the small town over a city is there are some stores and things you don't have easy access to, however its not much of a problem with BG, as Toledo is so close. There's also malls and shopping in Findlay, Perrysburg and fallen timbers, so you don't have to go further than 20 minutes or half an hour if there's something you need that isn't in BG.\n\nIf you're used to living in downtown Chicago, it may be quite a shock, but if you're used to a smaller city or the outskirts of one, its not too big of an adjustment. I used to joke about BG being in the middle of nowhere, but compared to going to Ohio U for grad school (where I am now) its actually pretty close to stuff. Now I often remember how easy it was to just go up to Toledo.\n\nThe bigger concern may be the weather. If you're coming from down south that may be a shock. Even just coming from Cincinnati I was shocked by how cold it gets. The wind makes a huge difference. If you don't mind the cold, its fine though.",

There's no point really in going to Toledo because...Toledo kind of sucks tbh. There's some fun smaller bars around town and if you're looking for culture you can always go up to Ann Arbor. It's a quiet place and I'm going be honest a lot of the undergrads kind of suck sometimes, but people are nice and there's good food (if you like bar food). We have no intention of continuing to live here after graduation but for grad school it's not too bad.",

It's not just bars and things, there are a ton of great places to eat and hangout. The Stranahan Theatre in Toledo host many great shows/ballets/performers. Even though it is in the middle of nowhere, there is plenty to do. \n\nIf you do come here, let me say welcome! BGSU and the surrounding area is a great community, and we take care of our own. ",

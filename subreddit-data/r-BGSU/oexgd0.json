    "postText": "When I was a BGSU student, there were several times when I would see this guy riding around campus on his bicycle playing a boombox and interacting with students. Everyone called him Boombox Guy. Much of what he played was whatever was on FM radio at the time, often on K100.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's an example of some of the strange behavior this guy has exhibited.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES1L4p\\_3Yss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES1L4p_3Yss)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe BG News also did an article on this guy back in 2008.\n\n[https://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8963&amp;context=bg-news](https://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8963&amp;context=bg-news)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas this guy been hanging around on campus often since that time? I know the video I linked dates back to 2015 a few years after I graduated.",

It would be some amount like 10 thousand, or 100 thousand inches of snow. Didn't matter what season it was, it was always going to snow.",

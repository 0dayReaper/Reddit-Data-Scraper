    "postText": "This is something that's been on my mind for a while and I'd like everyone's thoughts on it. A little background:\n\nMy family has had a number of people go to BGSU. Both of my paternal grandparents, my dad, his older sister, his aunt, and my 1st cousin (who even played football for them in the mid 80s). I always planned on going to BGSU, but with money being tight, I stayed with my maternal grandparents for the first year and went to the Firelands College in Huron. That turned into the second year and I decided to move home (I'm from Akron originally) and transfer to Kent to finish my Bachelor's degree. \n\nBut when I was at Firelands a number of people, including a professor, said that people at the main campus look down on Firelands people. I'm not sure why, maybe they think we aren't *really* BGSU students? I personally met Dr. Mazey twice in two years at Firelands when she was president. That's probably more than most people at main campus. I mean, it isn't a competition, but it says something (or maybe not, I'm just riffing).\n\nPoint is, what (if anything) do BGSU people think about the Firelands College? Good, bad, indifferent?\n\ntl;dr - always wanted to go to BGSU, went to Firelands for two years than transferred to Kent. What do you think of Firelands?",

            "comment": "If a main campus student were to look down on a Firelands student then I would definitely say they have some sort of insecurity they need to work on. I go to BGSU and it is definitely not a prestigious school by any means, so to look down on someone for going to ANY other school would just be dumb in my eyes.",

            "comment": "I've been a student and faculty at the main campus, including working with Firelands faculty, which was a pleasant experience. Most people don't think about Firelands at all, much less to think *less*  of it. If anyone felt that main campus folk look down, I'd say that's 90% or so likely their own insecurities projected out. (To be fair, I think almost 100% of what we think about others is our own inner issues projected outward.) Especially the professor who said that, perhaps feels down about not going to the main campus. As for students, the Firelands campus gets a very small portion of the graduation. (It's much smaller in comparison and gets announced last. I didn't like that at spring graduation. Firelands should be integrated with the rest of the colleges. It was cold and windy for that ceremony so most everyone was gone by the time Firelands students walked.) So that could contribute to their feeling looked down on. (And as I said, I don't think it's right that they were separated. I mean, all the colleges were separated, Arts and Sciences, Health and Human Services, Education, etc., and then Firelands.)\n\nIf your own experience, through evidence of meeting the previous president twice, is good, I'd say don't let the bad feelings of others taint that.",

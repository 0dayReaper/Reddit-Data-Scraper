The Green Platform is nearly identical to Bernie's though does not support the drone strikes, as an example. We would like help at BGSU and in Wood County to get the word out.",

I say that as a guy who wants the party to be successful, who voted for Nader years ago. Environmental issues matter to me (top 3 along with education and healthcare) and I would rather see the money spent and effort made in places where there is actual potential for success. Stein for Prez is a black hole for limited resources and honestly the only impact she can have in Ohio is to help Trump have a shot. Hillary is no prize, but Trump is a disaster waiting to happen and I don't trust the House with this decision given how badly districts are gerrymandered. ",

                    "comment": "First, Jill Stein is absolutely NOT anti-vaccine. She said the federal government should require all children be required to have vaccinations on preventable diseases. She is however, and rightly so, concerned that the FDA use information that is directed by science and not the profit of drug companies. On a side note, years ago I wrote a news story about BST, Bovine somatotropin, used on dairy cows, after a story appeared in the NYT or WSJ (I don't remember which now) They had interviewed some people from the Center for Science in the Public Interest. My story went out on the wire. One of the main items of interest for me was that the FDA had such lax standards. The FDA does no independent testing. Testing for BST had been done on a herd of cattle. Guess how many cows make a herd? Eight. And there were no requires that the cows even be different breeds. (I should add here that I had my own dairy herd at this time.) Where am I going with all this? That Jill Stein, like myself, believe the FDA should have stringent requirements and questions the results of tests provided by the very companies that stand to profit from the approval of drugs. At the University of Illinois, a drug company donated millions of dollars worth of buildings and equipment to the university who in turn conducted the research and testing for drugs. I call that a conflict of interest and honestly, do you expect the university to be free to criticize a drug? To last part of your statement, that is what they said about Bernie. Nothing will ever get better from people who vote out of fear. Nothing will ever get better unless people take a stand against the partisan politics that have gotten us in this mess. Nothing will ever get better unless fight. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.",

You do know that most voters WANT a third option as they oppose both choices? \nHow about you move along instead of arguing? If you are not interested in helping, so be it. People like you just make me more determined to create change, because your attitude is everything that is wrong with politics. Doing what you have always done will always get you more of the same. We are not going to settle for more dysfunction. ",

If a president gets 25% of the vote, it's harder to govern. I would be fine with an open primary that gets us to two candidates regardless of party. That feels like the kind of change that could get us somewhere. \n\nI want change too, we just differ in opinion on how to get it. I understand your desires, I just don't see a path that creates results when the primary effort is a candidate that polls under 5%. ",

Stein has the same issue that Bernie did. The msm and major parties do not want anyone upsetting their plans. Hillary was chosen years ago. So your idea is to go along with the most corrupt politician to be nominated by the DNC in years! Sorry, but that is no answer. Jill is rising in the polls and will continue to rise. You don't see a path because you don't want to see a path unless all the hard work is already completed for you. If you want change, you put the time and effort into making change happen. But you go ahead and vote for Hillary, because it is easier.",

If Jill Stein gets enough votes to win a few states, we could end up in a situation in which no one has enough electoral votes to \"win\". If that is the case, the House of Representatives as it exists before the election (currently heavily republican) decides who the next president is. Not sure I like that option enough to vote for Stein as much as I dislike the idea of voting for Hilary. ",

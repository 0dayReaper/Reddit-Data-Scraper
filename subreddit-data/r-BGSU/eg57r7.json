Dunno if there's any Cryptomythography or Cryptozoology courses though.\n\nSurely there are English courses that study the English classics and great works of fiction.\n\nNot sure if you're actually asking for a class that just studies a made up world though.",

There\u2019s also CLCV 3800, Classical Mythology as well as a few others under classical civilization. You could even minor in that if you want!\n\n[link](https://www.bgsu.edu/content/dam/BGSU/catalog/Spring-2020/arts-and-sciences/Classical-Civilization.pdf)",

I would recommend looking into English, Pop Culture, and CLCV (Classical Civilizations). I know that right now they are in the process of trying out new classes like Norse Mythology, and I wouldn't be surprised if they branched out and started covering how various mythologies impacted things like literature (including Tolkien, Riordan, Martin, etc)! Hope this helps!",

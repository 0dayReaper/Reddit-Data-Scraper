    "postText": "Hi i recently got accepted to BGSU and wanted some input from people already on campus before i make a commitment. How is the social life , what is the weather like (I'm from the warm south),how are the parties, how often are parties, how is campus and off campus food, how are the academics, is dorm life good, do you love bgsu , should i spend the next 4 years of my life here? I should also add that I'm an athlete and will be on the Track and field team (idk if this changes the social aspects) . Basically i'm trying to find out what weekly life is like here for students. Thank you.",

            "comment": "Gonna preface this by saying I graduated May 2015 and answer what I can, but it's just my perspective.\n\n* The social life is what you make of it. You can make no friends being a total hermit (which I did my freshman year and had a meltdown for, would not recommend.) or you can do your best to get involved in what you care about and things related to your career to make friends and put yourself ahead.\n\n* Oh boy. Coming from the South? It's way different. Summer is warm. (70-90 degrees) Spring is wet and cool. Fall is mostly dry and cool. Winter can be COLD and windy. After fall break, invest in a coat, hat, scarf, boots and gloves. The warm kind.\n\n* Parties are everywhere, academics depend on your major but they're generally pretty good, dorm life is good. I enjoyed BG, I have coworkers that graduated before me that enjoyed BG and interns who went to BG who seem to be having a good time. I think it's your general college experience.\n\n* One of my best friends played Soccer for BGSU. It's probably useless to mention but being an athlete affects your life greatly. You have people you'll probably become friends with quickly but all athletes know each other. It's definitely a sort of clique. They're not bad people, but from my experience, you all party and sleep with each other, which granted, isn't too out of the ordinary of anyone else. I guess it was just weird because everyone came with a title. \"Greg, the baseball player.\" \"Katie, the basketball player.\" Anyway, I don't think it's much different than high school either, but being an athlete seems to mostly be a good thing. Well, other than having to wake up for morning practice while everyone else gets to sleep in. Have fun with that. :P\n\nAnyway, assuming you're 18 and heading out of high school, don't sweat it. You'll probably have a good time. The climate is going to be a big adjustment for you though.",

            "comment": "Hey there, I'm currently a sophomore at BG who also comes from a warmer climate. \n\n\nSocial life is always what you make it, but everyone I see seems to have a friend. And even if you're not as outgoing, you'll probably stumble onto a few friends like I did. \n\n\nWeather: Like I said, I also come from a warmer climate. Besides what was already mentioned before (coats, boots, scarves, etc. for winter), you'll also want to bring a good umbrella and/or rain jacket because I didn't take that into account and had to buy both once I got there. It also gets pretty humid in the few weeks/month before fall hits.\n\n\nparties: I couldn't tell you much about the parties since I'm not much of a partyer, but I know that they happen every single weekend (including on thursdays, or so I've heard) \n\n\nFood: campus food is fine until you have to live there four moths in a row. My advice to you is don't eat there all the time if you don't have to. It gets repetitive real quick and you'll basically lose your appetite for everything. Luckily they kick you off campus after the first two years so you'll be able to make your own food then.\n\n\nAcademics:  generally good, but I don't know which program you're in. I'll just tell you that I've had 3 sucky teachers in my 3 semesters here so far. \n\n\ndorm life: I hate it, but then I'm also in Kreischer, the cheapest dorm possible. Don't live there if you can afford it. Pick a dorm with AC and a non-communal bathroom then pray to God your RAs will actually enforce quiet hours.\n\n\nI don't love BG but I don't hate it either. \n\n\nYou should spend the next four years of your life here if you don't mind moving away and leaving your friends and family behind for four years. I didn't realize how much I'd miss everyone once I left for college and I'd heavily advice you stay in-state if you prefer to be close to family.\n\n\nCan't tell you about athletics except that I know the football players are constantly busy (but the team still sucks)\n\n\nanother thing to consider is how much you want to bring. If you fly out, that'll vastly limit how much you can bring. You'll probably end up needing to rely on your roommates to bring the furniture like I do.  And on that note about storage, BG does not have anywhere for out of state students to store their stuff over the summer, or if they do, it's not well advertised. \n",

Like others have said Bg is a windy place but you get used to it. Food wise there is so much to eat, pisenellos is probably the best pizza in town. We also have this place called the cookie jar which is a little bakery that makes the best cookies in the world. Howard's is my favorite bar because they play live music every weekend but there are plenty to choose from",

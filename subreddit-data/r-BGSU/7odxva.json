The Aspen Dental in town is complete trash. I\u2019ve heard good things about Corner Dental on small things like caps and cleanings, never been there personally though.",

If it's Aspen or another chain dentist place, it's bad. This is because they hire random dentists who may not be reputable, but because the actual name isnt on the company, it's harder to stake a reputation on them.\n\nName businesses are the way to go for sure.",

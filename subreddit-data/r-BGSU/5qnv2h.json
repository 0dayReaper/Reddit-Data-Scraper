They have an awesome internship help program, so make sure to take full advantage of it when you can, as internships will help you more in some ways than school. As far as professors, all of them are cool and nice, the problems are with some of their teaching methods. Dr. Kresman is a good example. Great guy, but his classes are very hard compared to the others. Lots of learning has to be done outside of class to get a full understanding of what he's talking about. I personally enjoyed taking his classes for the extra challenge, and I felt like I learned a lot, but like I said, he's a tough one. Dr. Green, however, is your go to professor for classes. Whenever you have a potential class to take with him,  do it, he's by far the best professor in the department. He knows his stuff, and will help you anyway he can. Take his classes, you will learn a ton. If you have any more questions you can PM me.",

            "comment": "Graduated two years ago but I have a full time job in the area and one of our interns is going with a CS major and he's confirmed a lot of the stuff is the same.\n\nI agree with /u/TheMasterBaker01 . They require you to have an internship, and have you take an internship prep class, which is actually pretty amazing, from hearing other majors and their struggles getting into the workforce. None of the professors are bad people but a good half of them are not very good teachers. Maybe it's because they've taught the same things for 5-10 years now, but you are going to have to teach yourself a lot. On the bright side, they are always available for their office hours and are willing to help. Dr. Green and Zimmerman will likely have a line out their door, but it's worth seeking additional help. \n\nAlso, my biggest complaint about the department is how dated the material they teach you is. The great thing about coding is that once you learn one language, it's fairly simple to learn them all. When you go for an internship or full time job, they're going to be happy you know how to code C++ but as soon as you start working, you're going to learn HTML, CSS, JS, VB and C#. My advice is that, as you go along your college career, keep an eye on programming blogs and communities to give yourself that jump start. It will help you tremendously in classes too. ",

I'm sorry to inform you though that Dr. Zimmerman retired a year or two ago, but Dr. Green is thankfully still around and hopefully will be for many years, since he's easily the strongest professor in the department in terms of teaching skills.",

It's a good way to explore what employers interested in BGSU students are looking for.",

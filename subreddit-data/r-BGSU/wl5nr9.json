Honestly if you bring any \u201cno-no\u2019s\u201d in the dorms it doesn\u2019t matter as long as your RA doesn\u2019t find out (some are chill enough and don\u2019t care). McDoanld Hall while not being one of the nicest has a small more enclosed feeling that\u2019ll help with making friends on the floor. As far as the strictness of the school it\u2019s a pretty laid back experience and pretty much everyone I know that went to BG loved their time at school.",

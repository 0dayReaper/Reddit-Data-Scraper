                    "comment": "The original link I posted has more detailed guides on every type of device, but the general break down for wifi connections are:\n\n**Wireless**\n\nLet me start out by saying we have a very large number of new connecting users during this week, most heavily on Thursday and Sunday. Sometimes during this high traffic period, we see some issues with devices not connecting. To clear the bad network data that is causing this, we suggest rebooting your device. \n\n*Computer/Phone/Tablet:*\n\n Connect to the SecureBG Network and log in with your BGSU Username and Password.\n\n*Other Devices:*\n\n Register the Wireless MAC (Physical) Address of your device on http://netreg.bgsu.edu, wait 15 minutes, and then connect to the network ResMediaNet. This can be complicated, I would highly recommend watching the guide. \n\n**Ethernet**\n\nEthernet cables can be purchased at Falcon Outfitters, or off campus at Walmart. The process for setting those up is basically:\n\n*Computer/Phone/Tablet:*\n The cable to your device and launch a browser. You will need to pick a browser that allows re-directs this first time and load a page that is not a secure website. http://cnn.com generally works, but anything without the \"https://\" A page will load that for you to agree to terms. After you accept, register your device by using the Detect button to pull in your Wired MAC (Physical) Address. Wait 5 minutes and reboot your device.\n\n*Other Devices:*\n Register the Wired MAC (Physical) Address of your device on http://netreg.bgsu.edu, wait 5 minutes, and then reboot your device. This can be complicated, I would highly recommend watching the guide. \n\n\n**Speed**\n\nOur speed on the networks depends generally on how many people are using the network at any given time. That being said, the speed should always be as good or better than cable internet. Yesterday we had a large number of new users testing their devices which could have slowed things down, but here is a screenshot of my network speed test I ran this morning:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Kse2vqQ.png\n\nIf you find really slow speeds or if something won't connect properly for you, we suggest contacting ITS directly with their page http://www.bgsu.edu/its/contact. We won't know what to fix unless it is reported!",

Get one long enough for your needs, plus a bit. You should be able to put in a work order to turn on the Ethernet if it isn't already turned on in your room. Ask at the front desk what work order to put in, as some of the dorms are different.\n\nDepends on where you are if the WiFi is slow or not. Ethernet is almost always fastish though. I don't live in the dorms anymore, but they also disconnected me for using a VPN, so watch out. ",

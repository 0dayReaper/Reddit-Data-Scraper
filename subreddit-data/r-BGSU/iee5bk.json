    "postText": "If you're looking for a house to rent for the coming school year, DO NOT go through Frobose. They are so so so shady. They tried to tell us that we owed more money than was on the lease that we signed. They threatened to sue until we went to legal services and they told them they couldn't do that.\nThey also were mowing the lawn one time, and the lawn mower chucked a big hunk of metal that was on the ground right through the window, all the way across the house and put a big hole in the wall. If someone were standing at the stove cooking food, it would have hit them in the head and would definitely have put them in the hospital. When we told them about it they literally just shrugged their shoulders and said \"we'll have someone come replace the window\". 100% do not go to them.",

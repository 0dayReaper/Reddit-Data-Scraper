I had a great teacher for it in high school, but never got college credit for it so I had to retake it here. As I was taking it here, I kept thinking to myself, \"if I didn't already know how to do this, this class would be really hard with how the teacher is explaining it.\" So maybe you just have a bad teacher, making the class harder than it actually should be.

I've known people who went to highly rated schools and I can say with confidence that their experiences there were no better than mine at lesser known schools. You know who really goes to the \"top tier\" schools? Rich kids. I mean, give BGSU a $32 billion endowment and I'm sure we'd be at the top too. ",

A rich kid going to a top tier school may be lazy and end up doing absolutely nothing more than that \"art student working at Starbucks.\" The most important part of college is to build a professional network and plant your foot in the door. Classes will only give you so much information but if you work as a volunteer or gather intern experience you can build a good network of mentors and beef up your experience. I'm a VCT student and this is the very reason I believe that BG on TV at WBGU is better than VCTO because the former produces content and builds contacts in different fields while VCTO has largely been lectures and trips to Photoshop World.

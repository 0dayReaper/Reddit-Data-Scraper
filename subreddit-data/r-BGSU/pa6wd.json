None of which (other than intercourse) would be really fun for a date, imho anyway.\n\nIf you're on a date, some choice things to do would be to head over to the woodland mall's cinema.  Its half an hour walking distance if you don't have a car, and its not that bad to walk to or back from (there is a campus bus that operates to it, but for some later time slots it won't pick back up).\n\nGoing to a party or bar like webbedgiant suggested *might* be fun if you and your girl are into that sort of thing, but otherwise it probably won't be.\n\nIf you just want to spend some time together without doing anything fancy, you can take a walk down to the pond next to the technology building.  Its quite serene and might set a nice atmosphere.\n\nAs far as food is concerned, a nice place in town to eat at is \"Call of the Canyon\" and I highly recommend it.  BRING CASH THOUGH as they don't take credit cards, and I'm not sure on their policy regarding checks.",

Take her to starbucks on a date, stargaze, etc.\n\nTrust me, I've done it all. Just do what you think youd both enjoy!",

In fact, there's one opening up on the 16th, and running for two weekends: The Arabian Nights (Which I'm in, woo!)\n\nThe music department also puts on concerts daily or weekly...\n\nBut these are simply suggestions from the department I come from :)",

Probably most known is the Slippery Elm Trail, but there are a couple nice parks over there on Wintergarden Road, including Simpson Garden Park (much nicer in spring when stuff is in bloom) and the St. Johns Nature Preserve. \n\nThe disc golf course at Carter Park is fun, but not exactly the best time of year to engage in that activity. \n\n[Grumpy Dave's Pub](http://www.grumpydavespub.com/), above Easystreet, has a comedy night on Tuesdays and open mic on Wed. \n\nReverends is another great restaurant downtown.

Possibly the best in the nation but I may be biased. I would recommend it all day everyday and it is a great program that will get you in the air in the first month of school. ",

I\u2019m really happy with how the program has grown in the last few years and our fleet is pretty great compared to other schools. For the commercial aviation route a part 141 school like BG or OSU is great for qualifying for a restricted ATP. I can also see the appeal of other campuses, thankfully as long as it\u2019s a part 141 program you end up with pretty similar job opportunities after getting your licenses. You should definitely come for a tour and check out other schools as well and see what works best for you. I\u2019m happy to answer any questions you can think of. You can send me a PM if you want the details on getting a tour at the flight center, if the weather is good people on tours usually get to go up in a plane as well. Also make sure you get your medical done before you start training.",

Morale of students in aviation is at an all time low and only gets lower each week. Only 17% of fall 2018 freshmen finished private 1... when I started here it was 80%. Now that\u2019s not because they didn\u2019t try, there just aren\u2019t enough planes or instructors to accommodate the number of students we have here... this program will soon take 5 years for incoming freshmen to finish. Absolutely DO NOT waste your time at riddle though, you\u2019ll be more than $500k in debt for nothing but a name on your diploma, that being said the quality of classes and instruction is great... but do you really want to be a lifelong slave to the bank? I think Alex means NORTH dakota, which is a good program, but you\u2019re nothing but another number in the system, the directors of the program will never know your name and you\u2019ll likely never even talk to them. You\u2019ll get your licenses but get nothing out of the experience other than that. Again I recommend BG for the quality of the school and things you can do here, but you will be disappointed by aviation here",

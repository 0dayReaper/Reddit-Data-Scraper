    "postText": "My name is Zach and I'm a Junior at Adams High school in Michigan. Soon, I'm going to have to apply to colleges and Bowling Green seems like an amazing choice. From what I've seen, the school has a very nice campus, not too big and not too small. Attendants/Graduates of BGSU, how was/is your experience at the school? I am very interested in computer science and anything music related by the way.",

            "comment": "I had a great experience! Coming from Ann Arbor to Bowling Green helped me get a bit of a feel for college life, but still was a great time. Downtown is really close to campus, plenty of good restaurants around, and decent living options if/when you move off campus. Campus life is pretty great too, lots of organizations to join, activities like free movies at the BGSU Film Theater/Gish. Nightlife is pretty solid as well, some good bars downtown and a few pretty close to campus. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience.",

I graduated in the early 2000's, but I can tell you that any college experience is going to come down to what you make of it...wherever you go. Sounds like you already like the BGSU campus and town, which is a big part of it. I was only coming from Toledo, so it wasn't that different, but I did like the small \"college town\" atmosphere without it being too small.\n\nI can't speak for the music dept, but I do remember they had a pretty solid computer science program when I was there. I studied visual communications. I was also in a fraternity, but I think the greek life is a little different now than it was in those days.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed my time at BG. The campus is nice, good off-campus housing options, great local bar scene and restaurants, plenty of clubs and sports. Again, its what you make it. Good luck!",

If you're interested in broadcasting (radio, visual, podcasting, etc) they just had a new facility with fresh editing bays put in. If you're interested in that, can't recommend getting involved with falcon radio or wbgufm enough. Great experience at BGSU btw.",

            "comment": "Recent music ed graduate here! Whether you're thinking about majoring in music or just joining a choir/band for fun, BG is a great option for it. I focused on choral music so I can't speak to instrumental ensembles, but our choirs are awesome and super welcoming no matter what your skill level is.\n\nMen's and Women's Choruses are comprised of mostly non-music majors and are a great way to get connected socially on campus very quickly, while also getting to be a part of high-quality music making. Worth noting that Men's Chorus has a very strong and long-running tradition of barbershop singing if that's something that interests you.\n\nA Cappella Choir is kind of the entry level choir for music majors, but is open to non-majors as well. They do a little bit of all kinds of choral music and most people generally have a good time in that choir.\n\nUniversity Choral Society is more of a community ensemble and is open to students as well as just people from the area. They focus on the big choral staples and are probably the lowest-commitment choir. UCS is a great opportunity to meet all kinds of people, including people who may work in the field you want to get into.\n\nCollegiate Chorale is the highest level choir and is comprised mostly of music majors, but occasionally some non-majors will make it in as well. If choral music is a passion of yours, this is the choir to be in as every single person in that choir is dedicated to being the best musicians they can be both as individuals and as a collective. This and Ten40 (more on that in a second) were my two favorite choirs to be a part of.\n\nIn addition to the above choirs that can be taken for credit, there are also 3 extra-curricular pop a cappella groups on campus.\n\nTen40 is the all-male group and the group I was a part of. We did a little bit of everything from pop, hip-hop, choral, rock, barbershop, etc. While it isn't a requirement to be in the group, most of the guys end up also being in Men's Chorus and/or Phi Mu Alpha. As a group, we believe very strongly in the power music has to bring people together and the ideal of brotherhood, which connects to Men's Chorus and PMA as well. If you want to join a group the members of which will become some of your best friends for life, this is the group to seek out. We also compete almost every year in the ICCA's (think Pitch Perfect) which is a blast. We placed 3rd at semifinals last year which was super exciting!\n\nTonal Eclipse is a relatively new co-ed group on campus. I think it's mostly musical theater majors? Truth be told the 3 groups didn't do a whole lot together, which is something I hope changes in the future. Despite being newer they've been competing in ICCA's too and have done pretty well.\n\nThere's also the Acouschicks, the all-female group. They're mostly non-music majors but they still compete pretty regularly! If you have any female friends who are also considering BGSU and are interested in singing, have them check them out!\n\nSince I was a music major I can't speak too much to the other programs you mentioned, but if you have any questions about anything music at BGSU feel free to send me a message!",

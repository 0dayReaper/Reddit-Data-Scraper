    "postText": "In light of a conversation on another post here I figured I'd make a quick comment here. Professionals working on the highschool level shouldn't be understimated or undervalued. \n\nI'd imagine I'm not the only one that had highschool teachers that were to this day amongst the most inmpactful people you've ever met. Most of the teachers I had were honestly just as good as the professors iv had at Bowling Green. This is in no way a slight against BG professors as they were excellent.  \n\nConnecting this to the other post that was referring to our athletic department and future coaches that could be had. Some believe you can't find quality highschool level coaches that could do a good job on the collegiate level. \n\nTommy Tuberville was the NCAA coach of the year. He started off coaching highschool, then did an assistant role and before it was all said and done he was noted as the best coach at the time. There's the more obvious names like Chip Kelly who coached at Oregon before the NFL and Urban Meyer but there's been so many more. \n\nHiring a highschool coach and developing him in your university for a couple to even a few seasons as an assistant with the long term intention of making that person your next head coach is far from crazy. \n\nHighschool teachers, coaches, and even counselors can be effective at a high level on the collegiate level when given the opportunity. I feel like people don't value highschool level instructors nearly enough for what they can bring to the table...maybe I'm just venting or maybe I'm actually on to something. Thoughts?",

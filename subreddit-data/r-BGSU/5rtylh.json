We like to think we still have what it takes to crush beer pong... and are looking for some protoges to mentor.  We'll bring plenty of beer (and promise we're not *too* weird.  Well... one of the guys is, but we'll control him).\n\n[We *may* be chronicling our journeys here, too.](http://twitter.com/BGSUalumnipong)\n\nWho's game??",

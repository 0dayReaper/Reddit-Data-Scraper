I didn\u2019t go to BG but someone told me to ask here! We can just start as a discord group or something and have some watch parties if the playoffs start up soon! DM Me!",

If you\u2019re interested I\u2019d go to a few BG hockey game, they\u2019ve got a great team and it may be a good way to meet some fellow hockey fans.",

I agree with other poster... get involved with BG Hockey as a fan and you\u2019ll develop a good network.... they got a hell of a team",

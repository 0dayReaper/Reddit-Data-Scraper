It's right across the street from Mister Spots in downtown. \n\nThey're not too bad, about the same price as other salons in the Toledo/Maumee/Perrysburg area. However, my experience there is that they will just blindly do what you ask them. Even if you ask for input, they seem like they're more concerned about getting paid for the job than telling you that what you want will barely be visible and fade for 100 bucks. Granted, I'm a novice but the two times I've gone there for coloring, I've had to go back because I wasn't happy spending as much as I did for such little results.\n\nAnyway, if you know what you want, they're good there. They offer you water and tea. If you kind of just want to try something new with little knowledge, I wouldn't recommend them. /rant. ",

Every other salon I proved started at $100 for JUST the color. I'm not willing or able to shell out $150 for a cut and color in BG or PBurg. ",

It's changed a lot though (I still have friends who live in BG).\n\nHope that by the time you enter college this will be behind us.  Though I'm not in school, I feel for all the high school, elementary, middle and college kids throughout the world over the past year.\n\nThat being said, college was the best time of my life!  I'm not a bar scene person (wasn't in college) but I made a good group of friends I still keep in touch with, though we are all spread apart.\n\nI'll second that, you can stay on campus during weekends.  As for holidays, I don't know exactly, but I think you might for short breaks...maybe not long ones.  I don't know what's open though.  My freshman year a good friend had roommate who lived out of state (he wasn't able to go home often due to expenses).  \n\nObviously things have changed....but I still have great memories.  If you have further questions, you can feel free to DM me, but as I've said I graduated from BG over a decade ago, so things are different.  The campus is much different for sure, but I still might be able to give some advice (there are some things I think that haven't changed)....hope you seriously consider it for your choice of college.",

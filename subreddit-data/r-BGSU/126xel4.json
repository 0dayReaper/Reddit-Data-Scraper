Our alumni group has been officially recognized by the University and we have a clear path towards modernizing the club. The link below will describe exactly what our goals are and where you can contribute. They can be recurring or one time donation.\n\nWe have over $150,000 already committed toward this 5 year plan.  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/yQ3m3tX8cD4\n\nCurrent contributions during the BGSU One Day Initiative\n\nhttps://oneday.bgsu.edu/giving-day/67039/department/74812",

            "comment": "This will NEVER happen and you can thank Title IX.\n\nHave you looked at BGSU and every other D1 school and the number of varsity women's sports vs men's sports? Men's varsity teams were cut to deal with the gender equity gap caused by football. As a former varsity T &amp; F athlete for BGSU I can't begin to tell you how hard we tried just to keep a sport that was already established... I can't envision any route that would be successful to get a new one established.\n\nA small summary of our arguments;\n\n* Men's T &amp; F has an equivalent women's team, so there was equity for T &amp; F\n* The team was comprised of a multitude of non scholarship athletes that had a varsity team not existed, would have opted to attend a different university. These athlete's tuition should be considered part of the revenue enhancement of having a team\n* With the minimum GPA required for competition eligibility, this saw many athletes work very hard on their academic studies. Without being on the team, they would likely not have  had the extra motivation needed to succeed and graduate (we had a very high graduate %). We also argued that often these athletes represented race/ethnicity and/or socioeconomic populations that we thought the university wanted to impact in a positive way\n* We highlighted our rich tradition of success and positive exposure our athletes have had for the university... ALL Americans and always a few athletes making top US performance lists, sometimes even worldwide lists\n* (see above) We had Dave Wottle, 1972 Olympic Gold Medalist advocate for us keeping the team. He spoke to the BGSU President and every various board member\n* We organized with the other MAC schools for a SaveBGTrack campaign... I could tear up thinking about the other MAC T &amp; F athletes wearing \"Save BG Track\" T shirts at competition\n\nI will add that I have sat on two university boards, and and given emeritus title for both. I also received a BGSU Accomplished Graduate Award. I've attended the black tie events and rubbed elbows with all of the right people... and it didn't do anything in the end. I predict you will get a forum for discussion and an opportunity to present your case. That will all be semantics only.\n\nThe BGSU Club Rugby team has a rich history of top tier performance. As a student athlete, I went to a good number of home games. I was super impressed by the toughness and athleticism of the players. It bothers me as much now as it did then that the sport was not varsity. It deserves to be a varsity sport but I'm afraid that ship has sailed.",

Varsity is a goal down the road and there are many forms of varsity as they exist in the spectrum of college rugby. The university has met with us and given us the path to accomplish the goals needed to become varsity. The women\u2019s club are involved and included with everything we are doing. \n\nIt is a progressive, multi year plan to accomplish all of these benchmarks. We shall see what happens in the future.\n\nI personally think at some point NIL will play a role in assisting this but that will take some time. \n\nThank you for all the information and sorry for your experience at BGSU. Title IX was created for many positive reasons and continues to accomplish what it was put in place to do. Though it has some flaws that maybe should be looked at but we know the NCAA and federal government can\u2019t accomplish anything without having multiples years of studies and committees before coming to a conclusion.",

It will only get muddier now that we have the whole trans athlete situation with the NCAA.",

Mine was by the end of the week.\n\nI have over flown multiple times because I am a slow learner in the plane. Practice makes perfect and I need extra. The additional $ sucks, but other than that it doesn't matter at all. Academically I have not had much trouble, but students literally have CFIs cell number and shooting them a text is nothing and expected. CFIs often have empty slots in their day due to cancellations or people waiting on check rides so scheduling extra is usually really easy. Many of your actual professors will be pilots too so they can always be asked. We have professor pilots with experience in B2 bombers, Gulfstream 4s, multiple 747 profs, and the head of the program is a DPE so the experience is without question. Most CFIs there are CFII and MEI as well\n\nGenerally speaking at any given time there is always a minimum of 3 CFIs sitting around the flight center lobby bored waiting for the next gig and just dying to help someone so time goes by faster. And the more senior students in CFI training like myself are always dying to brag-explain what they know also.\n\nIdk if you have done a discovery flight yet, but once you get hooked on flying its easy to get obsessed, so the building is basically like comic-con for aviation studies everyday. Its the nerdiest most wholesome thing.",

    "postText": "Hey all! A couple days ago I finalized my transfer application for the fall 2019 semester. I  have been doing a ton of research on the college, watching videos, emailing, etc. so I can be as knowledgeable as possible about the college. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to come here to ask if anyone has any opinions or advice for me assuming I am accepted in? I should have zero worries getting accepted btw I have a 3.25 gpa and 63 credit hours completed haha\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance everyone!",

I transferred for the spring semester and had to pick on of the latest dates, which meant that when I went to register for classes during orientation there wasn't a lot of what i wanted available... and if it was available, it either didn't fit into my schedule or made my schedule worse. Good luck! ",

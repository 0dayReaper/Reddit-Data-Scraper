    "postText": "I'm a CS major, and am looking for a summer job. I have a job at BK from back home I can go to, but I really don't want to. Is there anyway I could get a summer job at/around BG? Even if it's just with ITS, do they offer summer positions? Doesn't necessarily have to be CS/Technology oriented, as long as it's not fast food/Retail. Thanks!",

Check worknet in MyBGSU or fill out our application here: https://www.bgsu.edu/content/dam/BGSU/ITS/documents/application.pdf\n\nThat being said, we are really only looking for people who are willing to work during the semester and during the summer. I can't speak for the rest of the University, but we do not offer summer only positions. ",

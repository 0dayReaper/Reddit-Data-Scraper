He was left with nothing.  Anyone who has followed BG football knew he had a complete and total rebuild.  He redshirted everyone.  He\u2019s going the Dave Clawson route, Clawson just inherited a strong senior class.  \n\nI\u2019m not saying he is the man, we definitely need to show progress this year.  But it\u2019s ridiculous to say we need to fire him at this point.",

    "postText": "Hello there!\n\nI have my eyes on going to BGSU for a Masters in Pop Culture Studies. I\u2019m currently getting my Bachelors and am at a sophomore-to-junior level. I have done a bit of research into the program itself and emailed the department head with some general questions, but I was hoping to speak to someone who has experience with the Pop Culture MA, or the department in general, themselves. I have some questions about the graduate requirements and would love some recommendations for what they look for in a resume for admissions for the major?\nThank you!",

    "postText": "Ok so as a freshman with a pretty good first day room draw time, I know I want to be in Centennial in a double.  Beyond that, and perhaps the floor I prefer to be on, how do I make a list of rooms ahead of my draw time.  I can\u2019t find a floor plan anywhere and don\u2019t even see room numbers in YouTube dorm room tours, so how do I know if one specific room location on a given floor is better than any other?  Thanks in advance for any advice anyone can offer.",

            "comment": "I guess I got my answer when I went through the selection process. There is no way to know where these rooms are unless you\u2019ve been in the building yourself or know where specific rooms are ahead of time.  During the selection process you only see room numbers and the identical few room layout options in the chosen building.  \n\nThis could be improved dramatically with a floor plan that would show students where each room actually is and which ones are taken/available. This seems like a simple and useful thing to produce and would take some uncertainty out of the process for first year students.\n\nHope someone reads this and improves the process as a result.",

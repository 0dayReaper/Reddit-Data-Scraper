I've done shows  in 23 states, i've opened for Rory Scovel, Kyle Kinane, Myq Kaplan,  David Liebe Hart, rapper Open Mike Eagle, queercore bands GRLwood and  Boner City, and a guy at an open mic who tried to throw his father's  ashes into the crowd. Come make my first time in Bowling Green a good time.",

    "postText": "I was recently accepted into the Masters of Health Administration program at BGSU and was wondering if anyone has had experience within that field or know any alumni who were successful after completion. I know the program is fairly new which is why I\u2019m hesitant and also considering Grand Valley in Michigan. Any advice/comments are useful even if you\u2019re not in this major, I\u2019d love to hear about BGSU since a visit may not be doable due to corona",

Great people and it\u2019s not too big, plenty to do while also giving you the chance to feel like you\u2019ve escaped. A lot of other cool cities are easily accessible from here as well. This is also the cheapest place I\u2019ve ever lived. I\u2019m in a grad student house rn and I pay 300 a month. Bigger than any of the houses my parents raised me in.",

            "comment": "I know some of the professors who helped create this Masters program. It was created after the dissolution of the Masters in Public Health consortium with UT. UT took the more \"health science\" oriented tracks and BG took the Health Administration track since they have such a strong business college. It's a newer program, so it's hard to say much about it, but BGSU's Health and Human services college has a strong track record of hiring faculty and staff with here strong professional experience; academia and research is there, but they definitely tend to be more employment skills oriented, so it just depends on what you want.",

    "postText": "Hi Everyone, there is a lot of undergrad input on here, but I'd like to hear from a graduate student perspective. How is life for masters' students? How available are your advisors, and how much hands on experience did you get? I'm considering the American Culture Studies program with a speciality in Public History, but I'm open to hearing from everyone. There isn't a lot on the alumni page of the BGSU website, which is why I'm asking reddit. :-) Thanks!",

            "comment": "I got my PhD in that program and loved it. The faculty are great, they\u2019re open minded about your course pathway and they believe in collaborating with grad students. ACS also is very generous with providing assistantships for their grad students- if you TA the intro to ACS you\u2019ll work with Rob Sloane who is just a great teacher, mentor and cool guy. With Public History you\u2019ll probably end taking classes with Andrew Schocket who is brilliant and rigorous. He worked me hard but it made me a better student, writer, and researcher. I greatly respect him. ACS also plays well with other departments so you\u2019ll be able to take classes in history, PopC or anywhere else without a lot of hassle. I was always a little jealous of the masters students because they were in classes with PhD students- so they were getting next level academics while honing their skills and research. I can\u2019t recommend it more.  Good luck with the process. Feel free to PM if you have any more questions. ",

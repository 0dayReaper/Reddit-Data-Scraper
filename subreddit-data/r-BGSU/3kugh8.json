So the previous owner of 149 had this verbal agreement with the owner of the building(149 and Lunar Station) that if she ever wanted to sell it, he would have right of first refusal. Essentially, allowing him to make an offer on the address, not the building, just his premise, before anyone else.\n\nWell the woman who owned the building died, and her daughter inherited it. 149 owner was preparing to make a bid, but in waltz's the owner of the Clazel, and make a better offer. He offered to buy the whole building in one simple deal, daughter doesn't live in the area, and just didn't want to deal with it, so sale approved. Clazel owner then comes in with a new lease for 149, upping the rent by large bit. 149 owner tries to fight it in court, but once money changes hands, the courts usually won't help you. \n\nEventually, 149 owner says screw it, and just moves back to Florida were he is from, as I understand. So Clazel owner, lets the guys who own City Tap opens a new bar. So the building is owned by Clazel owner, but the new 149 is owned by someone different.\n\nThat is the basic story, it might be a bit confusing/crap grammar. I am at work and don't have the time to be terribly articulate. \n",

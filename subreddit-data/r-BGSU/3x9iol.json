The only problem is that I don't know if I would have to transfer out of it after I get my bachelor's to go get my masters. It's still probably top choice for me for now, especially with how affordable it is. It would definitely be worth it if they offered a masters degree. I'm just not clear on whether or not they do because  of the website.",

I'm heard from people such as Dr. McKay (ask the admissions office, he'll be happy to talk to you) that the Toledo, Clevland, and Shedd aquariums are almost entirely staffed by BG grads.",

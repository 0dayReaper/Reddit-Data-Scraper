            "comment": "Sorry for the slow response, but the answer is it really doesn't work like that... \n\nCanvas is built primarily to be the source of information on active courses.  Once a semester a set of courses are created for all active courses that term.  The instructors for each of those courses is then given control of what appears within Canvas for that course, and when that information is available.  This is where things get a little confusing.  BGSU does not currently have a policy or rule on exactly how a course in Canvas should be ended.  Some instructors do nothing, leaving the course open indefinitely.  Some instructors choose to put end dates for the course, archiving the course after a set date and moving it into the \"Past Courses\" section.  Still other instructors choose to fully conclude the course removing it from Canvas all together.  \n\nIf what you are looking for is your past grades, you can locate those at any time by logging into MyBGSU, Clicking Student Center, and then clicking the drop down that says \"Other Academics\" and choosing grades.  At the moment that is the only information guaranteed by any rule or regulation to be available online for past courses.  \n\n**tl;dr:  Your instructor chooses when and hour a course is removed from Canvas** \n\n*edit a word.",

            "comment": "It's tough. I don't know anyone who doesn't match one OR MORE of the following categories:\n\n1) Takes out loans\n\n2) Has a spouse or partner they live and share expenses with\n\n3) Works the extra 8 hours allowed in the grad student contract (or more...) doing something for another department or off campus\n\nIt kinda depends on your program, as some offer better stipends.\n\nRegardless, it is possible. The low cost of living in northwest Ohio helps (though BG city taxes are kinda high), and Ohio car insurance, near the top in terms of affordability, is great (especially if you come from last-by-a-mile Michigan like me).\n\nBut here's what has helped tremendously: Figure out how much you (and partner, if applicable) will make in a year. All sources of income. If you can figure out or estimate the net, even better. (I started this after a semester so I knew what percentage of my paychecks were getting taken.)\n\nNext, add up all known and regular expenses. Rent, phone, internet, car insurance, health insurance, any subscriptions you have (Spotify Premium, Showtime, and Hulu are $5/month for ALL THREE COMBINED for students, FYI; take advantage of student discounts, always!) Multiply by 12 for monthlies then add to the total of annuals.\n\nNext, figure out and add up yearly estimates for unstable recurring expenses, like electric bills or filling your gas tank. For example, my typical electric bill is 35 dollars and double for three or four months in summer. Add a bit to each month because variation and just-in-case, and we get (40 x 8) + (80 x 4) = 640. Do that with everything. How often do you fill your gas tank, and what does it typically cost? For me, usually every two weeks for 20-25 bucks (25 x 26 = 650). Plus a couple hundred for trips back home. How often you do laundry, and what's the typical cost? Add in the cost of two oil changes because that's cheaper than fixing your whole goddamn car.\n\nFinally, add some amount as completely unknown expenses. Car might need new brakes, or you might want to visit Cedar Point, or you might lose your phone, or whatever. Be realistic here. There's no need to make this number overwhelmingly huge, but it's certainly gonna be more than $200. But I can't tell you what it is.\n\nNow, add together the three above paragraphs\u2014known, estimated, and unknown expenses\u2014and subtract that total from your total net income. Now, divide by 53. This is your weekly budget, how much you can spend each week. At the start of each week, buy groceries, toiletries, shit like that. Subtract that cost from your weekly budget. The remainder is your weekly allowance, how much you have to buy whatever you want. If you have leftover at the end of the week, it rolls over and gets added to next week's weekly allowance (not budget, unless you don't share the budget with anyone else). I keep my current allowance on my phone and update it as I spend it. Forgot lunch and had to order in? I subtract the amount, round to nearest quarter (though maybe I should do dime), and update the allowance. (I round to make the process streamlined. Doing it imperfectly is better than not updating the amount or getting fed up with it.) If you have a partner, you can split the post-grocery-run allowance so that you don't have to get every expense approved.\n\nKeeping this rollover allowance is really inspiring sometimes, and I'll challenge myself to grow it as much as I can (I got close to $300 once). Yet it's also good for reassuring you that you do have money and can afford on occasion to take your boyfriend on a date or replace your wife's broken travel Thermos or buy yourself a new fountain pen. (Okay, that last one might be more of a me-example.) Living on every copper-squeezed penny is for THE toughest motherfuckers, and it's no good for the heavy mental workload of grad school.\n\nAn important reason for dividing by weeks is the stipends usually don't cover summer, so knowing the weekly average instead of monthly helps keep those months from being absolute hell.\n\nA few final things:\n\n1) Want to save up? Put some money from your weekly allowance into savings. Or set it aside as part of the known or recurring expenses.\n\n2) You can move some things around (except fixed, mandatory costs like rent). I could remove the high gas estimate from expenses and take it from my weekly allowance, splitting the cost with my spouse. I could do that with laundry, too, or some others. But estimating high on some things is helpful so that the actual cost is less. It also keeps more of my allowance amount as reliably mine instead of having to wonder if I'll need to fill up my tank and therefore set aside anything.\n\n3) If your total annual expenses exceeds your income, you might have to take out some loans. (Then add the loan amount to your income.) If you're not comfortable with the numbers you get, that's something to really think about as you consider grad school.\n\nAnyway, this is what has worked for me. It might not work for you without modifications. But I think it's useful especially for dealing with no pay in summer and allowing some monetary freedom without being irresponsible.\n\ntl; dr: Figure out your weekly budget and roll over the unused amount into a weekly allowance. But yes, grad student stipends are tough to live on.",

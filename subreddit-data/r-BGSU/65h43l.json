Green carpeting, nicer appliances, vinyl kitchen flooring. Best place to live in town for the price.\n\nIf you are talking about HEINZ from Greenbriar, well, Greenbriar loves to keep things on the cheap. I lived in a few units by them and it was pretty much average. They tend to use the same things in all of their units. Honestly, see if Campbell Hill is available, is probably the nicest set of units Greenbriar has available, just a bit of a walk.",

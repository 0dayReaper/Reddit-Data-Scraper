Biking/walking to Kroger, Meijer, Aldi or Walmart shouldn't take too long no matter what part of town you live.  ~30 minutes one way to walk, ~10 minutes on bike, max.  Both limit the size of your haul, so consider Amazon Prime for non perishables and make produce, meat and milk runs a couple times a week.\n\nI don't currently live in BG and haven't for a few years, so I don't know if Uber/Lyft are active there, especially during summer.   If that's cost prohibitive, maybe just walk there and ride home, especially since you don't want to have to walk home with meats and milk in July heat.   ",

            "comment": "I genuinely think all social frats should just be banned because they provide little to no value to the university (in the sense of everyone affiliated minus the admin), and they incur a fair amount of negative things.\n\nPeople say they bring in money to the university, but if you look at donors the percentage of them that're former fratties is about as much as there are fratties on campus. The university might lose some amount of people who came mainly for the frats, but frankly I don't think that's a big loss. And as for the parties they put on, I don't think that's really much of a social positive either. They're either exclusive in dumb ways, and/or dangerous for women, and/or not even that fun, and/or the majority of people aren't interested in them. The worst alleged positive that's just false is their \"philantrophy.\" Everyone knows all (or most) of the frats don't really do that much community service, and of the amount they claim to do a significant (even if not majority) amount of it is faked or fudged. The greeks are so behind on social awareness that they're still doing big fundraisers every year for Austim Speaks, and obviously bad organization ([here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Va_XXoD5LE) for the unaware). All the positives they claim to bring are just not there.\n\nAnd the negatives are more than obvious by now. They enculture shit environments and attitudes of student on campus through chapter stratification and selecting members based on race, conventional attractiveness, and ability to conform. Their (usually unofficial) events are the most dangerous for women of the many things you can do around campus, overtly encourage dangerous drinking, and have predatory methods (e.g. freshman poaching during opening weekend, the signs put up during move-in). And obviously all the hazing sucks ass. Plus those greek houses are significantly empty (not as in less than half full, but much less full then the dorms), and the resources that went into building them was largely wasted in my judgement. \n\nObviously not all fratties are bad people, or cognitively endorse the norms of frats. But I'm not really talking about people: I'm talking about organizations. It's telling that the major greek response to this is trying to paint themselves as majorly against hazing even though the majority still do it (admittedly to various degrees), and advocating to make hazing a felony in Ohio. Usually wanting to make something against the law is an attempt to ignore a systemic problem and instead substitute it for a disciplinary problem. The issue isn't that frats aren't getting disciplined; the issue is that they exist.\n\nNow, I don't think they'll be banned on campus anytime soon (the temp suspension of greek activities is just that: temporary). I also think that my comments here apply more to frats than sororities (although they have similar and unique issues themselves), but you can't treat them differently due to Title 9. But, if there was a movement to ban greek life on campus (well, social greek orgs; not academic or multi-cultural), I think that'd be a welcome movement.",

They can even let orgs have whole house if they can fill them up, and the leftovers can go to people willing to pay around the same as Falcon Heights.

Excluding multi-cultural and black frats (I think the black frats have problems, but not in the same way the white frats do), they form about 11% of undergrads. Of that 11%, a little less than half join after their second year (I got this number from a national stat, not bgsu specifically). To me this signals that second year joiners aren't coming to BGSU for greek mostly. So let's say 5% of undergrads are into greek: of that 5%, at least half would be ok being part of other communities (even if there's an initial frustration) in my estimation. So at bottom you'd lose 2.5% of the current (and prospective) undergrad pop. But, I think that 2.5% can be replaced quite easily. Schools similar to BGSU have boosted 10-year enrollments through relatively cheap means (BGSU has quite good enrollment in the first place). \n\nSo I truly don't think BGSU has to pander to the fratties to keep going. The large portion of them just do not care about them. There's an analogy to be made here with the sports here. Despite it getting so much money, their attendance is quite bad. There's a feeling that they need to keep sports to be a university, but the students don't really care that much. It's likely the larger outside of campus community (alumn, non-alumn community memebers) that care more about the sports than the students.",

I\u2019ve also spoken extensively with a lot of other alumni, and they all agreed that this frat already had a reputation when we where students. For context we graduated within the last 5 years.\n\nMy own personal feelings about the administration unwillingness to address these issues comes from my own personal experience with them. If you\u2019ll remember a few years ago another frat dressed up as stereotypical Mexican gangsters, and the university was not able to punish them because they hadn\u2019t violated the student code of conduct. \n\nIf my memory is correct it was actually this exact same frat. \nhttps://www.toledoblade.com/sports/bgsu/2018/11/30/bowling-green-students-suspended-from-fraternity-after-mocking-mexican/stories/20181130131",

I graduated in May of last year and heard bad things about pike all 4 years I was there. \n\nI\u2019m just not sure how you address those toxic aspects of Greek life. For instance, BGSU promotes the saying, \u201cthese hands don\u2019t haze\u201d and I\u2019ve heard from several people in fraternities and sororities that members will mockingly say this phrase as they haze you. It just seems like such an undertaking that no one will be receptive of. It\u2019s like the silly alcohol tests we had to take online as freshman. It was annoying and didn\u2019t actually stop people from drinking excessively. \n\nI think something needs to be done, but I\u2019m not sure what it is so I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not in charge of policing Greek life. I think that in practice Frats and Sororities serve a function on campus for people who had problems making friends elsewhere like in their dorms. \n\nI\u2019ve seen people on this subreddit say that exact thing. They lived in Centennial their freshman year and no one came out of their rooms so they felt their only option was to join Greek life. I also think Frats like Pike make all fraternities look bad. There are Frats at BGSU like Phi Delt, and Theta Chi that just seem to be a bunch of nice nerdy guys in my experience and they aren\u2019t hurting anyone. (I\u2019m pretty sure one of President Rodgers sons is in Theta Chi)",

Especially when we have plenty of warnings about this type of behavior. That\u2019s the whole reason I bring up the situation with Halloween, and it sounds like this frats reputation was not limited to my own social circle.\n\nIt seems like there\u2019s an unspoken agreement that certain frats are allowed to engage in these behaviors, and so long as it doesn\u2019t receive publicity the university will not step in.\n\nMy biggest issue is that it really feels like BGSU is just covering their ass now that this story is getting national media attention. However there have been plenty of red flags up to this point that should of caused someone to step in. Once you\u2019re aware of the fact that as recently 2018 this same frat was doing toxic shit, and the university didn\u2019t punish them I think it becomes a lot harder to defend the university.\n\nAlso as someone who commuted my first year, never lived in the dorms, and never joined a frat i personally won\u2019t lie, I\u2019ve never seen frats and sororities as more than paying fora group of friends. They absolutely serve a purpose, but I think the nature of dues leads to a toxic relationship with those who may struggle to financially join a frat.",

Not having any idea that she was talking about frats I responded truthfully that I was in fact Italian American but I could understand why she might think so (I have brown eyes, at the time black hair and olive skin).  She sneered at me and said \u201cGod damned independent \u201c and stalked away.  The guys at the next table who were laughing at the encounter then explained what she meant.  When I responded that  perhaps she thought I was being flippant one of them responded that it was more likely that she had wasted her breath on some one with no value to her.  This experience sort of sums up my present feelings about these groups, they hold no value.",

Greek life was a problem then, and it's pretty clearly still an issue today.  I currently teach at a community college, where thankfully, there are no fraternities or sororities.  I honestly can't think of a single time I have said to myself: \"You know what would make this campus better? A frat.\"  \n\nThe problem is that BGSU has a long-rooted Greek tradition, and those organizations bring students and money to the University, which is what keeps it up and running.  These are large and rather influential (in several senses of the word) organizations with nationwide reach.  If the college bans Greek organizations, they could run afoul of some very wealthy donors.  Unfortunately, I think they will always be a part of BG.  \n\nSo, what can you do?  Refuse to participate.  Encourage your friends to do the same.  If so-and-so says \"Hey, you wanna hit the \\[fill in the blank with Greek letters\\] party?\", just politely decline.  Don't be part of the problem, be part of the solution.  It won't solve things overnight, but what it can do is start the school down the path that eventually does away with these glorified drinking clubs.",

I should admit that I knew people at BGSU as a freshman, so making friends was probably less challenging for me then it was for others.  I wouldn't judge another for joining a fraternity or sorority.\n\nI did not have a good opinion of this fraternity either, but they did not seem much different than the more dominant partying fraternities I have witnessed at other universities.  Let's not overreact to one very unfortunate incident by singling out an entire group of people.  You cannot assume that every member of this fraternity thinks and acts the same, nor is it fair to evaluate all fraternities and sororities the same.\n\nI can remember a group of sorority pledges being put on probation by BGSU and required to complete mandatory education on hazing in addition to doing community support for something really minor.  I could  have sworn it was because the pledges purchased little gifts for their bigs.  At the surface, it did not appear to be wrong at all, but because it was considered hazing, the administration took it really seriously.  I have a hard time believing that the staff involved simply turns a bind eye to alcohol related hazing.\n\nIf you really care, then do something good like donate to this man's family or reach out to see what you can do to support the family or friends affected by this tragedy.  Just jumping on social media and attacking people feels \"toxic\" as well.",

So far I haven\u2019t seen a single person attack this young mans family, and all I have seen is people rightfully point out how admin should of stopped this frat years ago.\n\nPeople are just rightfully pointing out that for years now there have been warning signs about this fraternity. It\u2019s seriously disgusting that as recently as 2018 Bgsu failed to discipline the fraternity for dressing up as racist characters because it didn\u2019t violate the student code of conduct. That seems like a major oversight on the administrations part. \n\nI\u2019ve had friends who where placed on academic probation for getting busted with weed because that was considered a violation of the code of conduct, but the university fails to routinely punish this frat for much worse things. All you have to do is read through this thread and see that this fraternity has had issues for years. It really shows the lengths that the admin will go to cover up for certain organizations. \n\nI really hope the national media that\u2019s now covering this story discovers all of the warning signs that have been there for years. More than anything that\u2019s what this thread is attempting to highlight.",

Considering what we have all heard, it is a reasonable assumption that this man died of alcohol poisoning as a result of fraternity hazing or peer pressure.  However, until the facts are better established, I find it hard to make assumptions about such a tragic event.  This man lost his life.  Rushing to judgement is not going to bring him back.  Why not gather all of the facts before addressing the problem?\n\nI never stated that anyone was attacking the man's family.  If you are \"genuinely curious\" then why are you resorting to straw man arguments?\n\nYou keep insinuating that the administration has been ignoring a past pattern of behavior by this fraternity, however the only real evidence you provide is an incident where members of the fraternity dressed up as mexican gang members.  One event does not make a pattern.  One event + a bunch of unsubstantiated claims is weak.  This is not to mention that in the case of the halloween incident, the administration's hands were tied.  As they stated, it was determined that the student's actions were protected by the constitution.  So here I will make an assumption, but to me it seems like kicking those students out of schools and suspending the fraternity would be the easy decision.  What a PR nightmare!  If you want to insinuate that the administration's decision was anything but a legally motivated one, then I truly believe that you are only interested in twisting the facts to suit your own narrative.\n\nYou mentioned the fact that you were busted for pot by the university and had to pay some consequence.  Are you still having a hard time dealing with that?  Are you looking for retribution?  Why not leave that in the past.  You have referenced the repercussions of getting busted with pot more than once in this thread and I don't see how that is really relevant to this case.\n\nJust reading your opening statement, says a lot about your intentions:\n\n\"I think it would be very beneficial for all of us who are either alumni, current students, or staff to discuss some of the more toxic aspects Greek life.\"\n\n...so you created a thread to talk about the toxcity of Greek Life, invited every person with a negative view of Greeks (kind of like shooting fish in a barrel), people pile on.  Unfounded allegations of rape follow. Flaming ensues.  The whole thing seems pretty pathetic to me.\n\nAs I stated previously.  I don't care for Greek Life, myself.  I had my issues with some members while a student.  However, I moved on.  I'd be happy to lend a my input to make my Alma Mater a better place, but this is not the way.",

I think people are a bit too harsh on the university in regards to policing Greek life. Of course is there is more that they can do but this horrible situation regarding Stone could happen outside of Greek life.\n\nI think this situation might have a lot to do with hazing, but it also has to do with binge drinking culture which is not exclusive to Greek life. I was never apart of Greek life and I had my fair share of instances where I drank way too much. \n\nAddressing the issue of binge drinking is nearly impossible because college students aren't receptive to being told they drink too much. You can police the streets and bust people for fakes, but underage people will still get alcohol.\n\nThe last instance im aware of where a student died at BG because of drinking was in the 80s and he passed out in the middle of winter outside and froze to death. There will always be issues that arise from the over consumption of alcohol.",

I wish somebody had told me half the stuff I know about BGSU I knew now as an incoming freshman. I understand that you may disagree with my intent, but I absolutely think it\u2019s important to show some of the more toxic aspects of this university. If we as former students don\u2019t speak up than nobody will ever know about this stuff because the university sure isn\u2019t advertising this stuff.\n\nAs myself and others in this thread have attempted to tell you this has been an ongoing issue for many years. It\u2019s a tragedy that this young man died, but hopefully the national media attention causes the administration to take action.",

                                    "comment": "&gt; Neither of us have any facts at this point other than comments repeated through the media. Considering what we have all heard, it is a reasonable assumption that this man died of alcohol poisoning as a result of fraternity hazing or peer pressure. However, until the facts are better established, I find it hard to make assumptions about such a tragic event. This man lost his life. Rushing to judgement is not going to bring him back. Why not gather all of the facts before addressing the problem?\n\nYou know this is BS. Foltz died because of hazing. People don't voluntarily drink to the point of great bodily harm, even when they're wasted. Also, the epistemic standard of evidence you're invoking here is a judicial one. The point of court epistemic standards is to adopt a higher standard of evidence than is sufficient to judge in every day life to mitigate the potential for abuse by the government. You invoking a court level standard is just ignoring the fact that we should think, right now, that Foltz died because of hazing. You even say it's reasonable to believe he died because of hazing. I don't know about you, but if I think something is reasonable to believe, and I have no significant evidence to the contrary (there isn't right now), I believe what the evidence suggests if it's sufficient. I think the evidence as of now is sufficient. If you don't think the current evidence is suffices to justify believing that he died from hazing, then say why you think that.  \n\n&gt; You keep insinuating that the administration has been ignoring a past pattern of behavior by this fraternity, however the only real evidence you provide is an incident where members of the fraternity dressed up as mexican gang members. One event does not make a pattern. One event + a bunch of unsubstantiated claims is weak. This is not to mention that in the case of the halloween incident, the administration's hands were tied. As they stated, it was determined that the student's actions were protected by the constitution. So here I will make an assumption, but to me it seems like kicking those students out of schools and suspending the fraternity would be the easy decision. What a PR nightmare! If you want to insinuate that the administration's decision was anything but a legally motivated one, then I truly believe that you are only interested in twisting the facts to suit your own narrative.\n\nThis is also BS. Anyone who makes effort to ask around knows that more than half the frats at BGSU haze to some degree of danger. Even TKE, the \"goofy guy\" frat, hazes at their big formal in a similar way with binge drinking. The amount of hazing isn't an open secret because the frats do make a significant effort to keep their hazing secret, but it doesn't take a NYT journalist to find out that they haze bi-yearly. Plus, it's also common knowledge that frat activities (mostly unofficial) are responsible for a disproportionate amount of Title IX reports that are submitted to the university. I'm not even gonna talk about the racism because I think it's well known that frats recruit partially by race (and not in the affirmative action kind of way), and have n-word touting white members not infrequently. If random recent students like me know (graduated 2015), then I'm pretty sure the admin can figure it out pretty quickly. Again, it seems like you're appealing to some epistemic standard that's inappropriate here, or that you just don't know what happens in BGSU greek life and are saying that because you don't know others don't know either. The university admin either know and don't care, or don't care enough to actually officially find out. My guess is that this is so because, like sports, the university admin think they need a greek life to keep running a university as successful as BGSU currently is. As I've said, I think this an understandable judgement, but I still think it's mistaken.\n\n\n&gt; You mentioned the fact that you were busted for pot by the university and had to pay some consequence. Are you still having a hard time dealing with that? Are you looking for retribution? Why not leave that in the past. You have referenced the repercussions of getting busted with pot more than once in this thread and I don't see how that is really relevant to this case.\n\nNot really addressing the substance of their comment. Trying to psychologize about a contributor in a discussion about what BGSU should do is just not appropriate. I have an urge to do the same to you, but I won't because I know that's inappropriate to this context. \n\n&gt; Just reading your opening statement, says a lot about your intentions:\n\"I think it would be very beneficial for all of us who are either alumni, current students, or staff to discuss some of the more toxic aspects Greek life.\"\n...so you created a thread to talk about the toxcity of Greek Life, invited every person with a negative view of Greeks (kind of like shooting fish in a barrel), people pile on. Unfounded allegations of rape follow. Flaming ensues. The whole thing seems pretty pathetic to me.\nAs I stated previously. I don't care for Greek Life, myself. I had my issues with some members while a student. However, I moved on. I'd be happy to lend a my input to make my Alma Mater a better place, but this is not the way.\n\nNowhere in your original comment, or this response have you addressed any of the substance of this person's concerns, or anyone else's concerns in this thread, including mine. Instead you have speculated about a random commentor's intentions, brought in unjustified skepticism (yes, being skeptical or suspending judgement is also something that needs to be justified), and brow beat some person for having a completely reasonable (in my judgement) response to his contact with university admin. \n\nYou say that you don't care for greek life yourself, but if I took out that portion I would have thought you were defending them or at least saying that we shouldn't negatively judge them in light of this recent hazing death and other public (or semi-public) knowledge. Why not just actually say what you think the university ought to do? That's what this thread is about.",

It's not about the individual members at this point: it's about the kinds of institution they have built and the norms of their institution. Their norms suck, and have bad consequences at the university and beyond. They also refuse to change their norms. Universities, including BGSU, have changed their actions towards greek life to some degree since, say, the 70s, but largely the greek orgs are allowed to do their thing by the uni (as in the rules say they aren't allowed to, but it's basically a semi-open secret, and nothing is done year in and year out). Making this about judging individual members is just a tactic to make it look like the growing number of people that want frats gone just want them gone because they don't like the people, which is obviously not a good justification. The justification is about the institution, not any set of members within the institution.",

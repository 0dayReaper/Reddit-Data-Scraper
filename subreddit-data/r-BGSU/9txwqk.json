Nope, apparently she quit and they couldn\u2019t be bothered to send even an email.",

They\u2019ve got nightclubs, chill bars, sports bars, and plenty of others that I can\u2019t really describe. As far as house parties go if that\u2019s your thing, there\u2019s almost always multiple house parties going on during the weekend. It\u2019s just a matter of finding a friend who doesn\u2019t mind letting a shit ton of random people trash their house lol.",

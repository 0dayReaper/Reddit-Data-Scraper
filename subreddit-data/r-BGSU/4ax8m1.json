    "postText": "Thought I would make a post mentioning the job fair that just happened on Wednesday, 3-16-16. I was able to meet with some various companies and exchange resume with them (make business cards, they all were impressed and some of them liked my card design). So far I got one phone call back from one of them and the others I already emailed so I'm just waiting to see what happens. Overall for just the half hour I spent walking around and maybe an hour of just tightening up a resume I now have a chance for a summer time internship or even full time job right out of college.\n\nAlso as a sort of happy note, entering the job fair puts you into a raffle for a prize. The prize was an Ipad mini 2, and I won it. [Thanks ITS](http://golffanatics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/So-I-got-that.gif)",

I feel like something similar to that class should be required for every major. Learning how to apply for jobs and actually attending the job fair, getting experience with interviews, it genuinely one of the most valuable lessons I learned while in college.",

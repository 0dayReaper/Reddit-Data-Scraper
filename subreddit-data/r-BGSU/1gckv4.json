    "postText": "Like a kid who is 10 minutes late to science class, all my friends are already paired off for the big project and I'm left to my own devices. I'm a 25 year old male attending BGSU for VCT/CS (I haven't decided yet). When I'm home all I really do is play video games, watch netflix, or read so I'm fairly quiet. Aside from that I workout, play disc golf, and go to the bars. I'm not one to throw parties, but I wouldn't mind if my roommates threw one occasionally within reason. I smoke (cigarettes) but I'd be willing to do that outside if need be. I don't do any drugs, but it's not my concern whether or not other people do. I have no problem with pets. I'm a decently clean person, so I'd like to live with a person(s) who won't trash the place. I would like to have roommates who are 21 or older, but aside from that I don't care if they are male or female. I don't have a place in mind right now, so if you already have a place lined up or if you want to find people before you start looking I'd be ok with either. I would only be looking to live in town, starting in July or August would work for me. 9 or 12 month lease would be fine. I can afford around $300/mo in rent, and I have a job as well as a car. I'm not sure if I'm forgetting anything, but feel free to shoot me a message or comment if you have any questions or you think you might be interested. ",

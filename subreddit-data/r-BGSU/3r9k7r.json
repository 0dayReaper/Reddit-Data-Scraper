    "postText": "Whats up ladies and gentlemen. Name's Davis and I am in a band called The Sunday Post out of Sandusky Ohio. I am a 4th year here and just wanted to let anyone who likes live rock shows that this Friday (November 6th) we will be in Port Clinton at the Lock, Dock, &amp; Barrel playing a show with the Bowling Green based group Ordway as well as some other great local groups! Just thought I'd spread the word around! If by some miracle you're interested in going, or just want to help support some local musicians you can contact me here and I can get you a ticket! Here's the bands that are playing! Have a great day!\n\nThe Sunday Post (pop punk) \u2013 https://www.reverbnation.com/thesundaypostohio\nColour Rise (indie rock)\u2013 http://colourriseband.bandcamp.com/releases\nOrdwary(hard rock) \u2013 https://www.reverbnation.com/ordway7\nUnlabeled (post hardcore/poppunk) - https://www.reverbnation.com/unlabeledband\nAncient Elephant (indie/reggae) \u2013 https://soundcloud.com/ancient-elephant\nSidewalk Outlines (pop rock)\u2013 https://www.facebook.com/Sidewalk-Outlines-1559820444278084/\n",

I also took Post-Communist Russia, which dives into modern Russian culture. That class was also interesting. You could go with a pop culture class, but I haven\u2019t always heard the best reviews from those types of classes. Not a humanity, but I recommend taking marine biology, it is something like BIO 1080. Super fun class.",

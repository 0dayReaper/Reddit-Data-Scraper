    "postText": "Hey all, just wanted to let anyone who may be a fan of the crew know we\u2019re starting a supporters group! The idea had been on pause given the news last year, but now that the team has a positive outlook the wheels are in motion! If you\u2019re interested we have a Twitter, @BGSCrew96 . With that, I\u2019m also looking for people to help build the group. If you\u2019re interested please PM me! Thanks! Go Crew!\n\nEdit: I just realized I didn\u2019t even tell plans. We\u2019re hoping to find a place to meet up and watch matches and maybe travel down to Columbus to see a few matches in person. ",

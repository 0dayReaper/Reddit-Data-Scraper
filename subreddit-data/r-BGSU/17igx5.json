We should try to liven it up here, get more posts, start making this a great place to talk to other students about life on campus and academics and more importantly get more people on here and spread the word. If anyone has any other ideas about how to make this happen we can message the mod and see if he would like to bring /r/bgsu to its full potential.",

I know some people suggested this before. However, how about meet-ups for board game night, COD/BFF/Halo game night, bar night, Reddit group to on-campus events (eg sporting/magician/on-campus mischief).\n\n2) Flash Mob events? \n\n3) Group for the Zombie V. Human games? \n\n4) Reddit group trip to Cedar Point/Mud Hen game/Toledo Art Museum/whatever. \n\njust throwing things out here.....",

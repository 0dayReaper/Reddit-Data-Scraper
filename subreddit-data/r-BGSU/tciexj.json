    "postText": "r/BGSU. If you're planning on writing the MCAT and are looking for a CARS resource, check this out! As you might already know, doing well on the CARS section requires a lot of practice. That's why CARShub has hundreds of CARS passages (new passages added weekly) all presented in the typical MCAT user interface. Please give it a try at https://carshub.xyz ! We've put a lot of work into it and would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks!",

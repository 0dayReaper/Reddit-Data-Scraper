I play a video game at the top world level and get paid a significant amount for it, and if I don't have the internet to do it.. well then I don't get paid, lol.  Most of what it is is out of state competitions, but I still need to be able to practice from where I live.\n\nDorm assignment still unknown.",

Vent/Skype/TeamSpeak all tend to lag a bit on campus...",

To give some more context, I am planning on majoring in Environmental Policy and Analysis, and I am wondering what scholarships I should apply for as well as which ones could automatically apply.  I know about the University Freshman Academic, Falcon Achievement and AIMS, but I'm looking for others.  Down below includes some info about myself that could be relevant:\n\nGender: Male  \nPart of the LGBTQ Community: Yes  \nRace: White  \nNationality: American  \nGPA: 3.821 (unweighted), 4.375 (weighted)  \nACT: 23  \nIn/out of state: In state for all of my life  \n\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and consider helping me out! :)",

Also the lobby of Kohl Hall which had been renovated recently was always nice quality, as people rarely used it, and then was one that was private, massive bathroom that had a door lock. ",

Since you seem to be a commode connoisseur, I'd suggest you check out the single occupancy bathroom in the basement of West Hall.  It's not particularly \"nice,\" but it's very spacious and hardly anyone is down there.  Definitely wouldn't make the list but worth checking out if you're up for something new.",

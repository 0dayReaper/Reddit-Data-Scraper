It really depends on if the faculty member was within his/her rights as deemed by the university. If they broke a rule of some sort, legal services would gladly represent you. It really depends on exactly what they did. I can't think of an example where they would refuse to represent you unless you were expelled. \n\nThat being said, don't take legal advice from the Internet though. Even /r/legaladvice openly acknowledges the best thing to do is just talk to a lawyer. They're pretty fantastic on campus, and will do everything they can for you :) ",

            "comment": "After graduating with my bachelors from BGSU, I went down to Ohio University for my masters and PhD. At the time OU was the #1 ranked party school, and this is what I learned about being party school rankings: They are absolute Bullshit. There isn't any difference at all. Everything listed in this article is true of all colleges (well maybe no the religiously affiliated or some really pretentious ones). Yes, BGSU is a great school for partying, and I had a lot of fun there, but the idea of there being a difference between party schools is really not true. The official rankings are also largely based on number of arrests. BG cops were pretty relaxed when I was there. If you weren't driving drunk, they didn't care. They may stop to lecture you that you weren't fooling anyone by using febreeze to cover up the smell of pot, but they preferred to let the minor college crimes slide and focus on keeping people safe. The cops at OU are dicks. They arrest you for everything, and will spend an hour searching your car. They ride up to the giant parties on horseback and in riot gear. That's why OU has the party school reputation, not anything about the parties.\n\n\n\nIf you want to argue that BGSU is a party school, don't focus on attractive girls, bars, frats, halloween and st. patricks day. Those are true of every school. When I've tried to explain what made BG different or more fun than the OU, I focus on things that made it unique. I remember people jumping off balconies into giant snow drifts. I remember the crazy late night cook in the utili-kilt at the Corner Grill. I remember seeing the Misfits at Howards, along with countless shitty bands. I remember crazy hockey games where BG would beat the far more talented Michigan just by pummeling them into submission. I remember eating alligator on a stick at Black Swamp Festival, and then feeling bad about it when I ended up at a party where the hosts had a pet alligator in the bath tub.\n\nEnjoy the parties and have fun while you're at BGSU. Some of the best memories of my life are from there, and I'm sure many of yours will be too. Just don't get wrapped up in party rankings or arguing that BG should be ranked higher. It doesn't matter.",

Amazing bar, and in an article dedicated to the alcohol scene of the town all Quarters gets is a shoutout in the last sentence? \n\nPower Hour, 14th of every month are both the best deals in town. \n\nI mean Christ, no mention of the Shot Charts? I still wear my shirt when I'm at home!",

            "comment": "Yep. BG is the cheapest place to drink, but it's so lacking in culture and life that it kinda just sucks everything out of you.  Strange place to be.  I always find it strange that \"drinking\" and \"partying\" are synonymous. BG is my home, but rarely have I found myself at a party where people were actually celebrating life.  Usually it's a shit show, a fight, and the noble quest for a hollow hook up.  Fuck the top party schools. Why would anyone want that. ",

I am asking Reddit because something similar happened at BGSU in Olscamp (a building with classrooms that that dozens of students, including ones who may potentially be on this subreddit, had visited during that semester). Your snarkiness is undue. \n\nI mean, the ability to draw something like that from memory probably isn't all that common. If you took a class with this instructor, I'm sure you'd remember him drawing it out and you'd probably remember the building. This pic came from a different thread on Reddit, and the OP mentions living in Ohio in his/her history. It's not like the idea is far-fetched. Even if this pic wasn't the map the instructor at BG had drawn, at the very least I thought someone might remember the map in Olscamp since it was kind of cool. It wasn't that long ago, and the map stayed on the board for a long time (I had a class in that room).",

Otherwise, expect little difference in average grocery costs.\n\nThis is your supersaver option. Avoid building 8 though if you decide on this option.",

My rent is 575 a month.\n\nGas had been around 25-35 dollars a month, but this winter it hasn't been below 90 dollars since October.  (Gas Heat)\n\nElectric runs 75 or so in the winter and 100 or so in the summer (3 Computers, 2 TVs, AC in the summer, electric hot water)\n\nInternet costs me around 65 a month, but I pay for the 12 MB down and 3 Up and I don't have my own cable modem.  (TWC Makes you rent that..)\n\nFood is roughly 9 dollars a day if I eat out sparingly, and 12-15 if I do not.\n\nBooze I can't give you good numbers, but booze is the same here as anywhere.  Expect to pay 6-8 bucks a six pack at home and 2-5 bucks in a bar per drink.\n\nAlso, if you have a Cat or other animal, almost every place will charge you more per month.",

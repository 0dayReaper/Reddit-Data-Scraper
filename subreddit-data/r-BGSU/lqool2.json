    "postText": "Hey reddit, my name is Riley and I am a member of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity on campus. Informal rush has just started (which means joining is easy right now).\n\nWe are a super diverse, tight-knit group. A lot of us enjoy gaming, exercising, sports, D&amp;D, literally any hobby you could imagine! We have the best GPA of all the fraternities on campus and are the least expensive fraternity to join. \n\nI would love to answer any questions anyone might have!",

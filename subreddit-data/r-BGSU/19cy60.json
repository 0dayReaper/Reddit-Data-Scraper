BGSU doesn't allow for temporary summer housing on campus, so does anyone know someone who is looking for a temporary roommate? Thanks!",

If you're interested, I might be able to set you up with my room for half the month's rent.  It's a three bedroom townhouse a few blocks off campus.  Two male flatmates.  Message me if you're interested.",

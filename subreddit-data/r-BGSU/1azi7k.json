It's a bit more expensive than a lot of places in BG, but it's not bad as far as pet apartments go, and they keep it really nice. Plus the managers and maintenance guy were great. Just try to live as far from the highway as possible; I spent my first year there on the second floor of a building right by 71 and it was super loud. The second apartment I was in was on the other side, backed up against Carter, park and that was the best.",

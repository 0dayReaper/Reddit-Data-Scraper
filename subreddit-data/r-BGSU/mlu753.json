While TWI is present at many other universities across the US, BG is definitely the most known.",

Another friend went to the meeting to prove me wrong that it wasn't a cult. She was raised Pentacostal and thought I was being prejudice against certain types of Christians. She went to one \"bible study\" and reported back to me, and I quote, \"Okay, you were right. Those crazy assholes think the Holocaust didn't happen.\"\n\nI also met someone years later whose family left Ohio to escape The Way International. \n\nI was super fascinated with them back then. There used to be a website called No Way Out that had stories of survivors.",

I'm not sure what that story was, but people presumed she stacked the staff with TWI people. I don't think it was known by administration. \n\nI remember that TWI had a rule that members had to live with other members. And being an RA is definitely the cheapest (though not easiest) way to get your own room on campus. \n\nI definitely never felt like the people in charge were members of TWI. TWI is super homophobic and in my experience Res Life was incredibly supportive of LGBTQ+ folks. I say that as a queer person who dealt with homophobic comments from another RA. After my experience, Res Life even added a part to the RA interview where they had to role play how they would handle someone coming out to them. Anyone who brought up their own religion during the role play was automatically moved to the \"No\" pile. So I really don't think Res Life was pro-TWI.",

Which leads to believe some sort of pipeline exists for the sake/attempts of recruiting. \n\nI\u2019m glad to hear and learn that administration holistically was not apart of TWI from your experience, perspective, and memory.

I always felt like no one really knew who they were.ore that they stayed pretty underground but they all went to the same University as a way for them to keep an eye out for each other. For example, I never heard anyone talk about TWI or try to get me to come to anything. However, one RA's family left TWI and other RAs in it seemed to not speak to him at all. Then, I heard a rumor that they had met with him and yelled at him (strangely that seemed to be a big tactic of theirs that was talked about on the No Way Out website, too) and all of a sudden he was only hanging out with other TWI people again. \n\nThe person I know who got pulled into it and then stopped talking to me only started going to the meetings after he started dating someone who was a member. I never heard any stories of RAs attempting to get their residents to join with them. I would have been first to make an official complaint if I heard of or saw that happening. \n\nI have always been fascinated by cults, so I did a lot of research when I found out about it. I asked my dad about it and he said that he remembered people around the University of Cincinnati talking about them in the 70s when he was in college. \n\nI really never felt like anyone in any position of power even knew they existed. More like the parents of these students would only allow them to go to a school where other TWI members were students, so they could be watched while away from home. And BGSU just happened to be a close and inexpensive option so they all went there. \n\nThey definitely had a big presence on campus, in numbers. But not a known presence. I would bring it up to people and noone would have ever heard of it.  I think they did their proselytizing in a very personal way. Like they would wait to become friends with you and then privately ask you to come. \n\nI actually borrowed a tape recorder from someone and the tape in it had strange chants in a language I didn't recognize. I just ignored it at the time, put my own tape in, and gave it back to her when I returned the recorder. I found out she was a member of TWI later and really kicked myself for not listening to the whole tape. I think it may have been people speaking in tongues at a meeting of theirs.",

Thank you for your admission and willingness to participate on this thread.\n\nFor those that may be following along or stumble upon this thread and are looking to further understand... all of the examples being mentioned are 100% methods, tactics, and the paradigm of The Way International (TWI) which was once previously/unofficially known as the \u201cKissing Ministry\u201d - for their adultery.\n\nThe Way International (TWI) is essentially a parallel of Scientology. When you remove yourself from the church/cult you are excluded and what they call \u201cMark and Banned\u201d. From research and testimonials, I would imagine the yelling included a lot of shaming and guilt, \u201crenewing your mind\u201d dialogue, as well as insults that deemed said person wasn\u2019t a believer or strong enough believe to rid themselves of the devil. Sounds fun, right? Said, no one ever.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the manipulation and coercion from members once they\u2019ve befriended you or \u201clove bombed\u201d you. Be aware.\n\nIt absolutely makes sense BGSU is part of their unofficial pipeline. The headquarters is in New Knoxville, Ohio - eastern \u2018ish Ohio I believe. Just ask locals what they think of the church/cult for an unfiltered response. \n\nFrom recently speaking to a survivor who left The Way International (TWI) they identified BGSU as a \u201cWay Campus\u201d for all the reasons mentioned. Additionally, to recruit (or proselytize) other to grow numbers and attain money (or tithe) towards TWI.\n\nYup! I\u2019m glad you brought up the tapes and speaking of tongues as well. Members at some point are required to listen to those repetitive tapes six days a week for three hours each day.\n\nLet me say that again.....\n\nSix days a week. For three hours a day. \n\nBrainwashing much? Unfortunately, yes.\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-way-international-victor-paul-wierwille/id1286818575?i=1000424201946\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-way-international-pt-2-victor-paul-wierwille/id1286818575?i=1000424641635\n\nHere are two excellent Podcast episodes on The Way International to listen to during your next long distance drive.",

I've seen it happen in places like grocery stores, Walmarts, or similar. They used to be pretty big on witness nights, going door to door to talk to people. Often times with a theme in mind to see if you could bring that specific topic up. I don't think many go door to door anymore, but the witnessing aspect is still a large part of what some fellowships continue to do. From what I could tell before I stopped showing up the one in my area, many younger generations starting speaking up about not doing that and being uncomfortable with the practice of randomly chatting up a stranger about Jesus.\n\nI've heard about this practice with the Way Disciple groups, specifically. All the participants moved away to another area for 6 months, they needed to get a job, find housing, etc. within a week. I believe they had quotas to fill, however, I'm not 100% sure on the details of what was expected. To answer your question, yes, they were expected to become involved in the community and constantly be on the lookout to speak to someone and invite them to a fellowship. All of this eventually building to running a class or two. I think that was the ultimate expectation from the Way to determine if it was a successful trip if they ran any Foundational and Intermediate classes.\n\nIt's certainly affected my life, especially since I was born into it. Now that I'm removed and taken the time to understand what spiritual oppression and gaslighting are, my eyes have been opened to a lot of the questionable doctrine the Way did/does (and quite honestly, many organized churches/religion). I've been able to take the time to discover myself without the brainwashing doctrine, and as a whole, I feel better and freer than I have, but I have times where flashbacks of spiritual PTSD pop up. It can be a struggle, some days. I also still have moments where the memory of a specific practice pops into my mind, then I feel like a lightbulb goes off and I realize how corrupt something was.\n\nFor example, many churches practice tithing. The Way, however, teaches you to go beyond just tithing, but to \"abundantly share.\" Meaning, yes you can give the first 10% of your increase (or paycheck) and tithe, but if you *really* want to reap the blessings from God, you should abundantly share. Stating, that when giving willfully, the more you give the more God will bless you. I didn't think anything about this as a child, but it wasn't until I was 32 to realize that was their clever little way of lining pockets.\n\nI hope this helps you! I'm still heartbroken to hear about Anna. I wish she could have felt like she had someone to talk to.",

And I hope it brings as much highlighting as well as awareness that\u2019s necessary - especially college students at BGSU where Anna attended and was ultimately a victim to practices of The Way.\n\nI\u2019m glad you brought up \u2018witnessing\u2019 and \u2018witness nights\u2019. This is common terminology they use and seems so harmless. I hadn\u2019t remembered earlier when I started this thread but I also remember being invited to a Saturday morning bible study with the Way once when I was much younger. Their incredibly warm and welcoming behavior doesn\u2019t give any immediate res flags. But afterwards like you\u2019ve shared someone is being driven by the pressure of quotas, how inorganic!\n\nThank you again for highlight the spiritual oppression aspect as well.

The goal being to spread Way teachings around the globe.  The practice stopped at some point but I don\u2019t know if they picked it back up.  My family went WOW twice.  The first ended with my parent getting divorced and breaking up the WOW family and the second ended after a year.  The witnessing was strategic.  It was meant to sign people up for PFAL or \u201cthe class\u201d as we all called it.  I took PFAL twice which was a week or two long class that costs like $200 or something:  you get a binder with some paper in it and watch videos for a few hours per night.  The class ended with VP Weirwille having everyone speak in tongues as the finale of the class.  Books by VP were sold also and people would also sign people up for the Intermediate class.  The final class was The Advanced class which lasted like a week but was thousands of dollar and all day classes.  My parents took the Advanced class 3x.  After VPW died, Craig Martindale began teaching PFAL.  He was a guy who loved to look at his own reflection in the mirror.  Called himself \u201cThe Man of God\u201d, anointed his chief followers with honey and was The Star of Athletes of The Spirit.  I was there on opening night watching him prance around in his basketball shorts and rainbow headband.  You wanna see something creepy just watch that.  But back then, we thought he was a hero.  When Martindale became the leader of the Way, that\u2019s when the cult stuff really became the most obvious.  The \u201cMark and Avoid\u201d became a thing, which totally broke up a lot of families.  The homophobia became a huge thing.  There are tapes out there of him screaming about homos (his words) and using even more profane language.  My parents would listen to these tapes sent out by the Way every week and we would go to Sunday Night Service to hear the Singing Ladies of the Way.  Martindale eventually got removed as president because he was having sex with one of those ladies along with several other women and they couldn\u2019t hide it anymore.  I stopped going at 14 and I was locked out of my house in Florida in the summer. People in my Twig (their study groups) tried to cast out the Devil spirits inside of me because I wouldn\u2019t go to Twig.  My parents left the country and abandoned me at 15 to live on my own due to me leaving the Way.  I know a lot about the Way if you ever want to know more.  My Mom was hardcore and a Way member for almost 40 years.  I went to the Rock of Ages at least 10 times growing up, WOW twice, PFAL, I was teaching the Bible at age 10.  My sister was baptized by VP Weirwilles wife.  My sister just went to jail for the umpteenth time last week.  Kidnapping and failure to show this time.",

There is a short article floating on the web that also clearly indicates and states this\u2026 the train has a camera in the front and has a recording of Anna jumping in front of the train; sources local news agency.

I happen to be on Reddit right now as your comments came in and can reply right away\u2026 so first of all thanks for commenting and continuing the discussion.\n\nYes I\u2019m not entirely surprised you mention that because TWI (like other cults) really extend themselves as normal Joe\u2019s with kindness and warmth. Doesn\u2019t sound terrible or nefarious at all, I know. But they are really recruiting and are expected to meet quotas. Even if it entails your local Walmart from the hours between 9-11am, etc.\n\nBGSU is actually an informal Way Campus. Part of their streamline. To my knowledge BGSU administration is not aware or on board with this\u2026 however, looking at the contributions/testimonies of others on https://www.reddit.com/r/cults/comments/mltoqn/any_recent_the_way_international_twi_survivors/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf you will see/find/read that this is true.

I didn\u2019t check the validity of the cases through cross-referencing with news articles, but the patterns of control and guilt are clear as day in each story. \n\nSo strange that I had lived in that community and had never brushed paths with them even in Christian circles.

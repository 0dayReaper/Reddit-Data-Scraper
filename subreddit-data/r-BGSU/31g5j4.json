            "comment": "I highly recommend Japanese. There are three teachers last I checked: \n\n(Dr.?) Akiko Kawano Jones - a friendly older woman that runs the Asian studies program and sponsors Japanese Club. You're expected to study under Akiko. You will be quizzed on things before they're mentioned in class. Self study expectations high. \n\nKumiko Saito - teaches some of the introductory levels. Never had her but have only heard great things. Less of an expectation of self study supposedly. \n\nDr. Satomi Saito - husband of Kumiko, a very chill Professor that majored in Japanese popular culture. High expectations of self study for all of his classes, but he tends to at least mention the material before it is quizzed or tested. \n\nAll three are referred to simply by firstName-sensei and use the same curriculum. And both Akiko and Satomi are active with Japanese club. \n\nJapanese written language is surprisingly easier than people expect. It takes some time to learn the two basic writing systems, but once they're in muscle memory you're all set. \n\nWhat a lot of my friends had difficulty with was grammar. I personally found grammar fairly easy, but had difficulty with all the memorization required for vocabulary. \n\nEither way, the Japanese exchange students always volunteer to do open office tutoring in Shatzel Hall, so it you want to learn it there aren't any holes in the program preventing it.

It was super intensive timewise and workwise and the professors were extremely inconsistent, I went from the level 1 class with one professor to the level 2 class with another professor and I was soooo far behind the students who had the same professor for both years. I ended up dropping the program.  (This was in 2011, so, grain of salt) \n\nSpanish was awesome. The way the curriculum is written makes a lot of sense and carries the same concepts through the whole year. It's worth mentioning,  however,  that I had previous experience in Spanish... so I have a bias.",

As with Russian, be prepared that any language that uses a different alphabet or that is totally different in origin is likely going to involve 2+ hours of class 3 or more days a week with homework every day. If you are considering making it your major then definitely! Go for it! If you just need a language for your gen ed requirement I highly reccomend Spanish (or french or german or another germanic/latin based language)",

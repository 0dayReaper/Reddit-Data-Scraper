            "comment": "I do not know if the campus is still like this (I left a few years ago), but there was a thing that was little known to everyone. All days (even weekends) all Residential buildings where packet filtered and throttled before 8PM to give priority to Educational buildings. After 8PM Residential buildings had unrestricted *fast* Internet (I got gigabit download speeds one night I still have a screenshot from). Some dorms have better Internet. Founders had the best when I was there. Probably after that was Falcon Heights (not sure on Centennial since that was Freshman only).\n\nSome games seemed to be given higher priority than others (my theory on this is the people working in the IT department that controlled the Internet did this to games they liked to play, but that is just conspiracy shit there).\n\nAlso, another important thing for gaming is make sure your access point is not clogged up. Always use wired if possible to avoid this. If you had to use a wireless connection, find the router that is closest to where you are sitting, that is probably your access point. Make sure there are not a bunch of people around you or try to find a new one with less people if there is. There are certain areas on campus where it was impossible to do online gaming because of how clogged up it would get (Commuter Lounge in Student Union for example).",

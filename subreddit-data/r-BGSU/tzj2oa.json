    "postText": "So I personally have had so many \"moments\" with the shuttles. Nine times out of ten, when I want to use the green shuttle, it's parked on the side of some road not actually on it's route, and it'll take forty-five minutes (often times more) to actually get back to doing it's job again. Sometimes it'll happen during every single loop the bus makes. And on occasion when there's a specific driver, the entire bus smells like cigarettes. I get that people need breaks and shift changes occur, but it happens on so many occasions at so many different points during the day in random spots throughout the city that it's just absurd. \n\nAnd just recently, which prompted this post, my roommate took the red shuttle. When needing to come back to our dorm, he noticed that the bus was almost at the stop. So naturally, he starts running and is in plain view of the driver and is just about right next to the stop. The driver, however, didn't slow down one bit and completely rolled through the stop, skipping him entirely. When the bus eventually came back, my roommate told the bus driver they missed him. In response, the bus driver says that he didn't miss him, and even if he did, he's an adult and needs to figure it out on his own.\n\nFrom what I'm told, the shuttle service at Miami isn't nearly as horrible as this. Has anyone else had any standout moments from the shuttles like this, or are we just that consistently unlucky?",

I was going to meijer and as they pull up I stand up the get off and the driver just zooms through the parking lot without stopping. He does this not once, but twice. I ended up spending an hour and a half or so on the bus. It\u2019s not just you, I\u2019m pretty sure everyone knows the bus system at bg is awful. \n\nI\u2019ve also got beef with them because they put a picture of me on the side of one of the busses without my permission but that\u2019s a different story.",

    "postText": "Hey there guys.  I'm an incoming freshman this year at BGSU and was just wondering what the LoL scene is like on campus.  I used to be a very competitive WoW player but switched to LoL for a more free-flowing schedule and was just wondering if there are any groups or a significant number of players on campus!\n\nThanks guys!  Also, hows the new McDonald Hall?",

I usually watch LCS every week it's on (Go DIG). Just a suggestion, don't pick WoW back up whatever you do or you're chances of doing well in school will plummet. I suck at LoL but my two buds are pretty decent. You're welcome to PM me.",

Scored a US 30th rank during the last tier of raid content on a three day schedule, and even though during that time it was the least I'd ever played WoW, it's still driven me away from the game.  I just don't have fun with it anymore (I'm very thankful for that!).  I'll PM you later on tonight when I get home.",

Also i got  a lot of feedback of people not being able to come for various reasons and for sure think there should be another meet up sometime soon! so i will leave the next one to my fellow redditors on /r/BGSU to decide!",

It was nice meeting others but I am also not the only person who can schedule a meetup, but next time i will for sure give more notice =) thanks for the feedback",

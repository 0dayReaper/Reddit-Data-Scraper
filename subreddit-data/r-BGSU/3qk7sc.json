    "postText": "I've been talking to a girl for some months now thats a freshman at BGSU. She moved there for college, and I'm in Texas. I wanted to get her a care package sort of gift, so my question is what useful things could she use there right now? She complains its cold and hates it lol, so I was thinking something for that. Any stores with gift cards as well? I've never experienced weather like you are even right now(cold), or seen snow so I'm at a loss at ideas. Thanks so much!",

There's pretty much any store within a 35 minute drive so if you know her favorite store you could get a gift card for her. You could get her a gift card for a manicure for a local salon (I recommend the gallery) if that's her thing. ",

I'd recommend buying alpaca wool scarves and mittens.  I prefer a cable knit hat and always wrapped my scarf to cover my ears if I needed to.  Good boots should also be considered.\n\nThings might have changed since my time but the dorms and campus buildings were almost always overly warm during the winter because they used a central steam system.  They probably haven't turned it on/up yet so the buildings are on the chilly side.\n\nIf you're both from the same part of Texas, you might also consider sending her some things she wouldn't be able to get in Ohio.  Regional brands, something your hometown is known for, stuff like that.  Never underestimate the power of being a little sappy.",

A nice cuddly blanket.\n\nAs far as stores we mostly have grocery stores here in town (Wal Mart and such) but if she has a car there's a couple decent malls just north of us in Toledo!",

If she lives in a dorm she can't have a heated blanket or anything so don't get something electric. If she hates the cold she might not want to venture out to get food when she gets tired of the meal plan, so maybe gift cards to polleyes, wings over, and other restaurants? There's also a good massage place on Main Street that could be a good treat. Movies and popcorn to cozy up with could be fun too! If you write her a letter and send a movie and snacks she'll be thrilled, those were my favorite care packages when I was in an LDR.",

    "postText": "I've been playing bass for about 3 years and am looking to jam with some people. It's not anything I really have experience with, and I've been really wanting to do it. I'm not looking for anything too serious, just wanna have some fun and play instruments with people. I honestly don't care what you're proficiency with your instrument is, as long as we can play together I'll be good. Guitar, drums, I'm up for whatever, just PM me if you're interested. Thank you.",

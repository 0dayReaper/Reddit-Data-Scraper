Freedom of speech is not being disregarded in the slightest bit- stay there and talk all you want. The issue here is that you cannot camp out and live in a public space, I don't understand the argument. I cannot just decide I want to camp out downtown, in a city park, or anywhere but my own property. Occupiers, with all due respect, you are taking this way too personally. It seems that the BG Police handled this situation about as respectfully as possible.\"",

I wish I would have know about this going down though. I would have loved to laugh at [this](http://www.sent-trib.com/images/stories/gallery/PhotoBlog/Blog/Occupy12052011/Occupy16.7300.jpg). All that said, I support the occupy movement, but the one here in BG is not doing anything, and is run by a bunch of sunbathed hippy kids from the University. ",

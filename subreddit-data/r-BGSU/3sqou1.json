Find another college, preferably in another state.\n\nAll the teachers in the Creative Writing department are either completely apathetic to your success, controlling psychopaths who micromanage every aspect of the workshop, or they're just plain incompetent. \n\nI've had two semesters of a creative writing major at BGSU, and I would rather streak across campus, covered in swatstikas, on fire, in the middle of a blizzard, on national TV, than go to another agonizing Prout Reading. In fact, I can safely say that the creative writing program has destroyed any passion I had for writing. I'm switching majors as of next semester.\n\nFuck Prout Readings and fuck the Creative Writing Department.",

If you're into problem solving and you're willing to actually put in some effort to pass a few math classes, CS is really bomb.  Now I can write programs solving problems I actually want to solve, and no o e can judge me but myself, cause I'm making the software.  Its fucking awesome.",

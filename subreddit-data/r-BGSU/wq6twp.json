    "postText": "Hey all, I've had a roommate suddenly decide to move home and not start the school year. I know my chances are incredibly slim, but if someone is looking for a place or knows someone who is, my house is right next to campus, $293/month, and fully furnished with a driveway and one other roommate. I've already exhausted most of my normal contacts for this so I'm just trying to figure out options before having to pay the additional room out.",

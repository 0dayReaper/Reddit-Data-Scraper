    "postText": "As we can all see, the logo for this subreddit is pretty lame. So, I thought the best way to change it is to have a logo contest. Anyone can create a logo and submit it. Hopefully some of you will see this and think of someone that might want to show off their art skills which should increase the size of the subreddit at least by a little. You can send your logos to redditbgsu@gmail.com. The end date of the contest is not determined yet, we'll just see how it goes depending if anyone even submits a logo. Good luck!",

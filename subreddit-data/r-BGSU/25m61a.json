You should know that the fourth floor of the student union is the best place to sleep on campus. You should get a Kroger card if you don't have one already and do your shopping there. There's a beautiful city park that has a public pool and Wi-Fi. Don't be afraid of the Falcon mascots, they are just dressed up students who genuinely want to hug you or high five. Join a club. Seriously. That's your best bet to find something to do consistently. Try to watch at least one movie or performance out on the campus lawn by the Wolfe Center. \n\nIt's not Columbus, but if you are adventurous, you will find a multitude of things to do at BGSU and the surrounding city of Bowling Green.",

I'm really going to miss it.  Keep in mind it's a college town, not a city with a university (or several like cbus). Amazing things are happening here all the time but things and people move quickly in and out of the town.  Experience as much as you can when you can. Stuff usually only happens for one day and then it's gone.  \n\nBgsu is open and inviting.  People don't judge to harshly and it's very politically active.  But the town is kind of split in two.  The other half is the townie side. The city of bg can be a little closed minded at time and is fairly conservative.  They are roughly 50 different churches in the bg/lucky/Haskins area. There s a couple temples a and a witness hall as well. \n Bg is great if you want to be entertained,  Eat drink and be merry.  And then go to a religious service the next day.\n",

Encourage your friends to go to class. Half the people you meet wont make it 2 years because they will party to hard. It's a god damn mI race that I  figured it out.

When you say you kept attempting for the position, that means you tried two years in a row and didn't make it past group process? I was an RA for two years and an RM (Resident Manager) for my senior year and also served on the RA selection committee. It is a tough process and a lot of people apply and even those who make it through to the class aren't even guaranteed a spot. Basically, the process has way more people apply than there are actual RA spots, at the time of group process, interviews, and even the beginning of the course that is required in the spring, there are STILL more RA candidates than there are RA positions total on campus. Actually it isn't until near the very end of the spring semester that the current RAs are asked whether they are coming back or not, and then those empty spots are filled from graduating seniors/RAs who are moving off campus etc.\n\nI'm wondering, did you have an disciplinary actions taken against you while living in a residence hall. If it was serious enough this could have lowered your chances of getting an interview. Also, on the other hand, since there are such an overwhelming amount of people applying, excellent candidates slip through the cracks, which is unfortunate. Also, perhaps your personality didn't shine during group process and maybe that was something you could have worked on.  \n\nIt sounds like you are pretty much determined to transfer, but just an FYI, you may have been able to go through your RA/Hall Director, etc. to meet with someone from the selection committee to see why you kept getting refused an interview.\n\nIt's really unfortunate! I hope you will attempt to do the RA process at BG or get involved in some other way. I'll be working in student affairs at the Office of Multicultural Affairs and many in my cohort will be graduate hall directors, I might be able to put in a word for ya!",

I worked actually for the dorms as an OA and probably could have been an RM but didn't finish my application in time for that. I applied for RA twice and never got the interview so I thought I could have a better chance if you try at another school. I was also a treasurer for JTAB, so I was active in reslife there. But being closer to my gf and best friend will help and I'll get to meet even more people at BG which will be awesome. And thank you",

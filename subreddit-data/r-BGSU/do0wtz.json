There are keggers, there are house parties, etc. \n\nThat being said, you'll be in the dorms, where there are no parties, you'll not really have any connections to get into real parties, and you're underage so no one is going to want you to come to their party anyways. \n\nIf you're going to college just to party, then please just save your tuition money and have your older brother pick up a slab of natty from Meijer instead.",

Guys, sorry, but you\u2019ll have to pay a cover charge at some, know a frat member, have a girl with you, or you just won\u2019t be allowed. My advice is to find a group who likes to go out and get connections, but offer to host pregames in your dorm (and have alcohol) in return. \n\nBars are fun but only if you\u2019re tipsy/buzzed. Girls, lots of creepy guys so watch out. Guys, don\u2019t be creepy. \n\nMy biggest piece of advice is to find a group of people who you like and who won\u2019t ditch you when you\u2019re drunk. My group has it planned so one (of about 5-7 depending on the type of event) of us is sober/only had one drink, so that way we all get home safe, with our keys, and without anyone we don\u2019t wanna be with.\n\nSo I\u2019d give it about a 5/10, it\u2019s definitely not a party school like OU but if you know the right people",

Unlike some of the other halls, most people in Centennial keep their doors shut all the time, so you might miss out on the \u2018community\u2019 feel that other halls get. But meeting people isn\u2019t impossible, I\u2019ve become friends with the people next to/across from my room. If you get involved with activities during the opening week you\u2019ll definitely meet some people from your hall floor. Centennial is also right next to a dining hall/mini market store so getting food is very very convenient. I\u2019m not into partying so I\u2019m not sure what halls have that atmosphere.",

All but 3 of the guys joined Alpha Sigma Phi and some of us will still text even tho that was 6 years ago. Guys and girls all got along it was like what movies portray dorms to be like it was surreal. \n\nBUT my now gf lived in Centennial the year after me and she hated it so it's a luck of the draw with who's around you. The in room bathrooms and AC is worth it alone tho.",

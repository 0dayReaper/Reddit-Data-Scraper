I work maintenance and grounds for a school district now and that insane life safety issue could be fixed in a couple hours with just 2 guys and a truck. I guess my point was John Newlove was the grandfather that made the name. The family must have split along the decades but the reputation of quality really only belongs to John Newlove instead of others using the name for recognition. I rented from both and never had issues with John Newlove vs. the other newlove company that was unresponsive to my issues years ago.",

                    "comment": "I understand not caring about the student housing stock in the following sense: it's probably the case -- like many other public universities -- that BGSU doesn't contribute much in the way of resources to the city of Bowling Green (mostly because, iirc, because BGSU is/was a land grant uni, it's land taxes are much lower). So the logic is this: if you don't care about us, we don't care about you.\n\nAdditionally, I'd imagine that there is *some* sort of connection between the profit margin of the major landlords (via lowering costs by having not that strict housing stock standards), and either the council members or people the council members want to benefit. Sandy Rowland is a real estate agent (which indicates possible excess sympathy with property owners writ large); Greg Robinette is a partner at a law firm specializing in patent law (again, indicates he's a big fan of property norms in general, which usually means less public intervention); and Bill Herald is prof who also likes using his knowledge for private enterprise (a vision of the university as continuous with private enterprise, which is, again, likely on the conservative side even he he labels himself a Dem or liberal). Phipps i know less about, but she seems to be transitioning from law practice to other stuff, so her self-interested decision might be to align with whoever has the money (aka, landlords and businesses). None of this directly evinces that they're \"in the pocket\" of the landlords, but instead it just signals that they likely don't ever want to put private enterprise lower than public interest. \n\nI think the best move to do right now is make doing escrow as easy as possible for students, and advertise it heavily as an option for when your housing isn't sufficient. It has some of the effects of a rent strike (withholding resources from landlord on demand of better upholding of the lease contract) minus most of the big-n-scary-leftist stuff (it's not extra-legal like a rent strike, and isn't a bunch of people all \"ganging up\" (lol) at once). Hopefully if enough students (and non-student citizens!) would take up that path, then the landlord would either have to somehow (wrongly) influence the county law to change escrow process, or give up and just make fucking better apartments.",

Was supposed to take an intro to statistics course this summer , but dropped (professor stated that the expectations were that we spend 6+ hours a day on that class alone) Has anyone taken an intro statistics class recently that they can recommend , either at BGSU or a community college that will transfer?",

In order to keep my time line I signed up at Tri-C (community College) and did a remote class where I watched a live class through a Webcam over the summer, but had to go in for tests. I passed and it transferred flawlessly. This kept me on track. I'd still discuss with an advisor to go over any details I missed/forgot, but this should still be an option.",

His class is really easy but he\u2019s also a very great professor. If he\u2019s still a round, I\u2019d recommend him 1000%.\n\nI took a few summer courses through Owens Community college. Like 90% of the classes they older transfer to BG. It kinda sucked from a learning standpoint , but it was pretty easy and I had no issues.",

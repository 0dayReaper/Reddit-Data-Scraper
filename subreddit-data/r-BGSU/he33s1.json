Like if we\u2019re going to be wearing a mask at all times, do we take it off to eat and once finished put it back on and move on with our day? I don\u2019t understand that aspect of it I guess.",

Everything that could be prewrapped was and the salad bar, soup, and breakfast bar were closed. I'm assuming that will be the same? I'm also assuming you'll have to wear a mask while inside and not eating",

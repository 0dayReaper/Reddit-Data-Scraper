    "postText": "I was told by a friend in his senior year at BGSU that all of the Athletic students are given Beats By Dre. They way he explained it, the university is paying for them and giving them out as an incentive. I've noticed that all of the athletic students that I've seen or met do in fact have a pair. Has an one else heard about this? ",

They are then told not to flaunt that the university paid for them. \n\nI'm kind of skeptic about it since it's a secondary source. That's why I asked if anyone else has heard about it.",

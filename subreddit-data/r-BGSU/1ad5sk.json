    "postText": "Hoping to start a consistent post on this board, I started thinking having a series of weekly \"Best of BG\" posts would help any new or prospective community members decide on the community.  \n\nThe general idea here is simple, post your favorite pizza in or around BG and why it is your favorite.  To help bring everyone on the same page, I will try to list as many as I can here, but if I miss one let me know:\n\n* Marco's\n* Domino's\n* Papa John's\n* Little Ceasar\u2019s\n* Pisanello\u2019s\n* Campus Pollyeye's \n* Myles\n* Padrone\u2019s\n* Falcon Foodmart\n* Pagliai\u2019s\n* Pizza Hut\n* Oasis\n* Vitos\n",

I even like their bread sticks.  \n\nTheir pizza sauce is just totally unpalatable to me.  It is too sweet, with a weird acrid aftertaste.  There is almost no tomato flavor to it, so I just can't get down on eating it.  \n\nI have tried doing cheese dip with bread sticks and only ranch pizzas, but I just would rather eat elsewhere in BG. \n\nThere is a pretty solid Pizza Buffet in Findley, if you don't mind about a 25 minute drive.

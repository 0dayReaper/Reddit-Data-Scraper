    "postText": "Hi all. I'm currently a freshman living in Centennial. I'm also a recording artist, and it's difficult to record in my room due to roommate/AC constantly kicking on and off. \n\nI'm wondering if there are any places I can record my music on campus that ensures a quiet environment, while being free? I've heard the library has something of the sorts, but have not gotten around to checking it out. \n\nThanks in advance!",

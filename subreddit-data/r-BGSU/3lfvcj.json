WiFi in the Union always sucks and ITS limits residential Internet before 8PM on weekdays (or they use too, I have been away from BG for almost a year). I had friends who carried Ethernet cables just so they could used a wired port to avoid bad WiFi access points. \n\nWhen I lived in Founders ~3 years ago, I could get upto 63MB/s down overnight on Steam. \n\nBGSU has speeds beyond 1Gb/s but it comes down to hardware that is at the point you are accessing. None of the WiFi routers are Gigabit routers. ",

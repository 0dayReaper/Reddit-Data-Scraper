    "postText": "Hello everyone and welcome back to campus. Each year around this time I stop in with this information. If you are moving in on-campus this Fall, first congratulations, and I hope you have an amazing experience this semester. \n\nIf you find yourself struggling to get your laptop, phone, gaming device, streaming device, or really any other networked connected device on the BGSU network, check out our video resources at www.bgsu.edu/getconnected\n\nSomething to keep in mind, BGSU is in the middle of a wireless network upgrade across all of campus. This is going to be a multi-year project, so some residence halls will use a slightly different system than others. For more information about this project, you can check out this site. https://www.bgsu.edu/its/projects/lg-projects/wifi-upgrade.html\n\nFor additional assistance, please contact Information Technology Services at 419-372-0999 or through https://www.bgsu.edu/its/remote.html",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, I just got hiring by BGSU (can\u2019t say my role yet because it\u2019s not official to the public yet). I am searching for a cheap place to rent an apartment for.i am fine just renting one singular room also. I am 25 years old so no college housing. A furnished room would be preferable (can\u2019t bring my bed from New York). I\u2019m looking in the $300-$400 a month range and would like it to be close to BG. Thanks for your help!",

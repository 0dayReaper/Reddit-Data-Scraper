Given the nature of the comment, I'd expect them to investigate it. It's quite clear that racism is not tolerated at BG, no matter where it happens, and that includes non-college related websites. It IS their business to investigate racism, because it doesn't matter where it happens to them. This isn't a violation of a free-speech, because you agreed to a policy of no-tolerance-of-racism by attending classes at BG. This is what \"no-tolerance\" entails. ",

To clarify: I'm not going to discuss about that, but keep in mind that when you go to a specific college, you must abide by their rules; one of them here is \"no tolerance of racism on or off school grounds\". That includes remarks made on twitter. Whether or not they SHOULD do that is another debate. But it's what they do, what they stated they do, and what they're doing here. Going to their college is not a fundamental right and they can refuse anyone they want for practically any reason (excluding gender, race, etc). \n\nEDIT: Correct me if I'm wrong on that last point, I could very well be wrong. Also, investigating off-campus activities is a natural part of what colleges do. They were asked to look into this. As far as I'm aware, the people involved haven't been kicked out or anything. This is just an investigation as far as I'm aware. ",

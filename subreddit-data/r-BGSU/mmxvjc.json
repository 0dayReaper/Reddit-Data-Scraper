How about doing something actually helpful for society rather than just skimming from the university money supply to provide another piece of software that does nothing or a service that no one wants.",

Just compiling resources to help facilitate conversations between high school counselors and their students about the college application and selection process.",

Do something that actually matters.",

Because yes, you are exactly right, the overwhelming majority of counselors in US public schools are very overworked and have a counselor to student ratio that makes it near impossible to develop any semblance of a relationship with their students with the time and resouces they currently have available. Happy to chat in more detail about our mission via DM, if you are interested. Thanks again.",

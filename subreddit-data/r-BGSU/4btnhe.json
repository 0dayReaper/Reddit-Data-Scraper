Needs to be nice and clean, the more utilities the better, and small is totally okay. I would also appreciate knowing which properties are horrible. thx:)",

I've never really had a big problem myself with any of them. \n\nStay away from the immediate campus area. Frazee, E Merry, and the apt complexes to the south are largely undergrad. \n\nYou may find a private house on S Main renting a single bedroom studio etc. Some of those big old houses are really great imo.

I think they're the nicest places to rent in BG. They also allow pets if you have any. Utilities are not included though. So you'll have to cover all of that.  ",

I had a favorable experience with Greenbrier however many have had less than pleasant interactions. \n\nWest side of Main Street will be quieter and South of Napoleon you are in the not much money part of time but you have access to things like Walmart and Big Lots.

Personally, I was called an idiot by Greenbrier's lawyer for assuming the word \"pets\" was plural. \n\nSerious answer to this question though, I found Smith Rentals and Mauer Service Center to be great small time rental companies. There was a thread about two years ago that listed a TON of options in BG, here is a link:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BGSU/comments/2zqdd4/places_to_rent_in_bg/",

They fixed things, gave me back a full deposit and were nice enough to lock my monthly rate in despite raising it in my building. When I went to change apartments because I missed the resign deadline by a couple months, they drafted a new lease with a rate 35/month higher. I came back after getting something notarized and they said something flattering and gave me a revised lease with my old rate. \n\nI eventually moved far away from campus though, drunken aggressive bros and a moderate increase in crime made me never want to live near there again.

They have a pool, although small, that doesn't open until most of the undergrads are gone.  \n\nThe only problem we ever had with them was scheduling a time to leave and get the apartment looked over.  But I think that was more of a scheduling conflict than anything.",

The place is small by some standards but it's quiet and the responsiveness to service calls is wonderful since it's owned by the Gearharts. Which is doubly nice to avoid all the mass renting agencies in town.\n\nOne bedroom, nice little kitchen with an island.\nGrad students only, cheap rent and utilities (gas, electric and internet). Walk-in closet. Only potential downfall is no pets allowed. They also rent somewhat selectively because there aren't a lot of units.",

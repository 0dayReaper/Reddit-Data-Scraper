            "comment": "It probably depends a LOT on the program you're in, and the personalities of your advisor, the professors you work with every day, and the other students in the program.\n\nThat's going to be 50% or 75% of your life in BG, so I would say be sure to steer yourself in the direction of the people you really enjoy working with.  For instance if your program has a few different branches, during your first semester look for the one that feels like the best fit for you.\n\nOutside of your department, BG is a great place to spend a couple years.  It's a really underrated city and university.  People are friendly.  The Student Recreation Center is brand new and awesome.  Campus as well as the city is very clean, well maintained, and safe.  There is a lively downtown within walking distance of campus... great coffee shops.  Food options are plentiful but can be pricey, I recommend Pita Pit and South Side Six for having great value though.  Housing off campus is very affordable.  Summers here are nice.  The other seasons, well, its Ohio, so hopefully you like having four seasons.   \n\nFor a break from the town, Toledo/Perrysburg/Maumee is very close, Ann Arbor is an hour north, and Cedar Point is 90 minutes away. \n\nWhat program are you in, where are you from, and what other questions do you have?",

Do you mean, like, life as a young professional in a college town, or do you mean specifically targeted things for graduate students?\n\nIf the former, I'll say that BG is really quiet, despite the huge undergraduate body. Just pick your bars and living area wisely if you want to maintain a separate existence. If you want museum nights, concerts, artisan restaurants, you'll have to drive 15-20 minutes to Perrysburg, Maumee, or Toledo. But it's often worth it.\n\nThere are 2 craft breweries downtown and one beautiful new coffee shop that specializes in exceptional coffee. Great place to study and the owners are a delight. \n\nFor the latter: the Graduate Student Senate is always trying to come up with mixers for graduate students. I don't think they're very well-attended, but it's not because people are unfriendly. Your cohort and program mates just kinda become your family, and we're all really busy. But the opportunities are there.",

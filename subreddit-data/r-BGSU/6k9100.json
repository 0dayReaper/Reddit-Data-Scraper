If University Film Organization is still a thing, you should join up. You won't touch a camera in class your first year. They can suggest how to check one out though for personal projects though. Good luck.",

Especially for earlier film production classes, you're gonna start off using these old 16 mil cameras made in West Germany as well as janky wooden tripods. Basically what I'm saying is you get better access to equipment the further up you go. There are also orgs on campus like the films orgs or BGonTV where you can use nice film equipment (especially BGonTV since we can check out stuff from the local PBS station)",

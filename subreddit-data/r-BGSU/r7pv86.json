    "postText": "The BGSU Men's Rugby Football Club will be playing for a chance at their second national championship on Saturday versus The University of Tennessee.  The match will be live streamed via The Rugby Network. You can download the app and watch for free though there might be a login requirement but all streaming on this app is FREE. Also for Apple users, it is only available for mobile, so if you want to watch it on the big screen you'll have to stream it from an iPhone or iPad. The match begins at noon, don't miss it! Go RugBG! Ay Ziggy Zoomba!!\n\nInstagram\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/rugbgofficial/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/rugbgofficial/?hl=en)\n\nTwitter\n\n[https://twitter.com/BGSUMensRugby?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor](https://twitter.com/BGSUMensRugby?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n\nYouTube Channel, Only 200 subs off of 1,000, almost there!

    "postText": "So I was checking my final grades in my student center because I wanted to make sure everything was right. I made one of my classes pass or fail and in order to get the passing grade you need a C or better which is 70% or above. Well my final grade in Canvas in my class shows a 70.44% but my student center final grade shows that I failed the class. I already emailed my instructor and asked him whats up with that but is there a specific place I can email or call to dispute that? Really freaking out because I earned that grade through hard work and really needed to pass that class.\n\nEDIT: Professor emailed me back and everything got cleared up!",

The only other choice you might have is talking to administration or the department, but that would be a last resort, and I would wait to have a conversation with the instructor first. The professor is the one with the the power to change your grade, and generally, what they say goes. From my experience, P/F is always a risk, and if the C is registered at any percentage below say, 71%, then you would have \"failed\". You just need to talk to the instructor. And remember to be polite, that goes a long way.",

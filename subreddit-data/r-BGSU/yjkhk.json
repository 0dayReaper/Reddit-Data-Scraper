I need housing for the fall semester only and would only be around Monday night until Thursday during the day.  I am clean and will keep stuff picked up.  If you, or anyone you know, is looking for another person to fill some space let me know.  I am looking to pay around 300/month.  Thanks in advance for your help.",

I would like to be a crew member for shows, and I do have crew experience from my high school and working on a couple extracurricular shows.  \n(Edit: changed cocurricular to extracurricular)",

For certain shows, I\u2019m not even sure you need to be a student at all! My first BGSU show I wasn\u2019t a student, but it was an Elsewhere show. Not sure if they still do those.",

It let you sign up for backstage jobs and shop hours and included some lecture. But any students could apply for grant-in-aid to work in the shops/on shows. Hose hours were much more demanding on your schedule though. \nAgain this is knowledge from 10+ years ago, but I think it still works that way.",

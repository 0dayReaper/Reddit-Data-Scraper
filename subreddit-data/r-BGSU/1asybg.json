Lets try to stick to formal events, businesses, or cool ways to waste away an afternoon.  In general, avoid something that only happens once.  Also, lets avoid general \"going to the bars\" statements, but feel free to post weekly events at a specific bar.  \n\n* [This Historical Society](http://www.woodcountyhistory.org/#)\n* [Movie Theater](http://www.woodlandbg.com/movies.html)\n* [Grumpy Dave's](http://www.grumpydavespub.com/)\n* [Stones Throw](http://www.thestonesthrow.com/)",

Discount night used to be $3 but I think they raised prices by a dollar last semester.\n\nIf you get to a cinemark at the end of the year or after January 1st they will have a refillable popcorn bucket and giant soda cup that you can purchase and bring back to be refilled for $3 each. So if you see movies a lot you can pay $10 for a movie, popcorn, and soda. Not bad for theatre prices!\n\n\nAlso the Clazel has dubstep shows on the first thursday of every month I think. Concrete Jungle ads will go up every once in awhile for real information, I have only gone a couple of times but it was a good time if you're into dubstep/electronica music.",

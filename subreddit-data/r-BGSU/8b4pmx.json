I'd say most of the people at the rec are just focused on themselves, so don't worry about feeling intimidated. Once you start making it routine it'll just be a habit and part of your day like classes. \n\nIt might help if you have a buddy to go with. I like to stay on the upper floor and row a lot. Find something you like whether it's walking or lifting or whatever and it'll all be cool.",

Something simple that they can work on and get accustomed to the gym.",

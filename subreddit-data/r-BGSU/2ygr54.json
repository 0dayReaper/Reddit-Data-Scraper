    "postText": "So, this is just exploiting at this point, but you free shit is free shit. Microsoft recently announced two awesome programs which BGSU students can take a unique advantage of.\n\nThe first lets you get Office 365 University for free if your school has the Office 365 Enterprise for Faculty and qualifies (which BGSU does). Which you can get here: http://products.office.com/en-us/student?tab=students\n\nThe second lets you get unlimited OneDrive storage if you have a Office 365 subscription (see the first offer). You can get this one here: https://preview.onedrive.com/?wt.mc_id=oo_blog_onedrive_onedriveunlimitedstorage\n\nBGSU now uses Microsoft Exchange for email. That means all of our .edu accounts are Microsoft accounts AND BGSU has promised to let us keep the emails for what? 5 years? 10 years? Life? So couple this with both of the two offers, it (should) mean unlimited OneDrive storage and a free lifetime Office 365 University subscription.\n\nEnjoy. I already have the first rollout of 10TB on my OneDrive and I have not paid for Office in like 4 years.",

            "comment": "Just as a full explanation here, your BGSU Email through Microsoft is a student account. The storage on OneDrive isn't unlimited through BGSU, or through the standard EDU accounts, but it is 1TB which is basically unlimited. The Office 365 Software can be accessed online through OneDrive OR downloaded to your machine through BGSU.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in Office, I posted something about a year ago on this subreddit about how to download it, but the video for the install process is here:\n\nhttp://www.bgsu.edu/its/services/computer/personal/installing-office.html\n\n\nYour email access through the Office 365 account will remain with you for life, assuming you graduate BGSU and become an Alumni. There are a few more situations in which your account access could be taken away, but those are really really rare cases. More information on that process is here:\n\nhttp://www.bgsu.edu/its/services/accounts/account-status-timeline.html\n\n\nAccess to OneDrive and Office 365 is currently still being removed from your account after you graduate in line with Microsoft's guidelines that these tools are only free to students, not alumni.",

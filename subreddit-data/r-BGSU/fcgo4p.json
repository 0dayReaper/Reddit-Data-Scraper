    "postText": "Yesterday during the final round of the Honda Classic PGA golf event, a Kent State grad named Mackenzie Hughes was tied for the lead.  Around the 14th hole approximately, he was getting a yardage from his caddie.  The caddie had a BGSU logo on the front of his yardage book holder.  About the size of tha 50-cent piece.\n\nThis a former BGSU golfer?  Anybody?  Hughes doesn't have a working web page and his caddie is not noted on his PGA Tour page.",

Hughes was encouraged to become a caddy by former Masters champ Mike Weir, who is from his hometown of London, ONT.",

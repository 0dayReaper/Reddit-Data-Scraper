Neuroscience at BGSU is really more of an interdisciplinary field spanning biology, chemistry, and psychology.  Neuroscience is technically under the psychology department.  You'll be doing a really healthy mix of all three fields and depending on your preferences you can favor more over others.  For example, I enjoy chemistry, so I went for the full year of OChem and that not only checked pre-reqs off my Neuro bachelors but it also gave me a minor in Chemistry.  It was a ton of work, but worth it in the end.\n\nThe class size for the neuro program is about 30 students at any given year.  You will probably run into them throughout but it isn't a \"cohesive\" group of people that are always around in all of your classes.  So if you like the idea of working with other neuro students you might not enjoy it here.  I'm rather anti-social so I really only knew 2-4 neuro students when I was there.\n\nThe one piece of advice I can give to any student going into college for a field of study that conducts scientific experiments:  find a professor to be your mentor and join their lab.  I learned more from my experiences in extra-curricular labs than I ever did in class.  It also looks fantastic on your resume for going to grad school.  Most of the professors on campus are really nice, so even getting a list of their emails and asking them through that could yield favorable results.  The earlier your start those extra labs the better because my junior and senior year were packed full of upper level classes and I really couldn't focus on extra labs at the point -- even though I did, begrudgingly.

            "comment": "Take what you want. Wait a semester or even two before declaring. Don't pigeonhole yourself into a major too early--as you might decide to change at a later time, and you'll have screwed yourself over.\n\nBusiness: supply chain management and sports management are both very respected. I'm not really sure on many of the sciences, but PopC is really good. As far as more humanities based, we have many great cultural programs: African studies and Asian studies are both great, as well as the Canadian (lol) studies. \n\nOne of the best things BGSU has is the learning communities. Chapman, Honors, Geojourney (geology based) and some others (you can find em on the website) are all fantastic. Have a check into those as well.",

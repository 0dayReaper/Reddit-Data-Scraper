    "postText": "Hey so I decided to take the initiative and say there is a /r/BGSU reddit gathering going to happen at 6:30pm @ City Tap. I choose that time because usually people are done with work by 5 and it's still early enough that people under 21 can get in without I.D.. Join /u/webbedgiant and I in drinking, fun, and interesting conversation. I promise we don't bite.... hard! Let me know if you need more information or if you expect on stopping by. \n\nEDIT: it will be just me tonight  i will be sitting inside the bar, at the bar that faces the street! I am a female!",

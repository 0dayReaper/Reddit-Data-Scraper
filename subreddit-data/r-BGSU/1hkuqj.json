    "postText": "Looking for someone to sublease my apartment. It is a upper level two bedroom very close to BGSU. Private, quiet location on the end of a new building (1997). You will love this place. Washer and dryer, central air, electric oven, dishwasher are included in the apartment. Lots of space to park your car, this is an ideal apartment for anyone. I am moving because I have taken a job in New Orleans. ",

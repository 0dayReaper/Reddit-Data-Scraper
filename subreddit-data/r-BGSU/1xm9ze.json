I am having trouble locating a roommate and even apartments in general. \n\nIf any of you fellow strangers are interested, know of someone interested, are in need of a roommate yourself, have any recommendations in general it would be greatly appreciated. \n\nLocations is not really a problem, just preferably close~ish to campus. \n\nThank you for your time.\n\nPS. Is there a craigslist for BG/BGSU or something of the like that could help in my search?",

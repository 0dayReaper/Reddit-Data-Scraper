    "postText": "Nothing is more frustrating than showing up to campus 30 minutes early, and drive to 6 different lots, all full, with dozens of cars circling for the same 2 spots that open every 30 minutes. I'm either having to park illegally in spots that don't exist, or illegally at off campus apartement complex parking lot. If the school can't accommodate for the number of students, then why am I paying $120 to pay to park on campus. ",

I lived in one of the houses and street parking was generally full but there is normally a few spots open. The houses either have drive ways or parking lots so the street is generally a safe bet to know you aren't taking parking from someone else. I saw plenty of people park in front of my place and never was really bothered by it.",

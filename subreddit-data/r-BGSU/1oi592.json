    "postText": "This topic of threads was started last semester, but due to lack of me posting hasn't been going on in a while.  The idea is to create a list of the best of a specific type of thing in BG.  This week the idea is Best of New Businesses in BG.  New should refer to anything that opened after August of this year.  While this thread will basically become  a list of new businesses, I am hoping people will review things they have tried or have been to.  Feel free to post things you do not already see as well as any honest reviews.\n\n **Bars**\n\n* Blo\n* Shots Inc\n* Liquid\n\n**Restaurants**\n\n* Sushi Bar (Near Jedds) \n\n",

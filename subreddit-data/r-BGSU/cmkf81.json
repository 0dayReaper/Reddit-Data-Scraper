            "comment": "Obviously the Koch brothers fund various things that're pretty shitty, from right-wing media programs and think tanks that enable patriarchal white supremacist values (though I think some of the educational things they fund are at least ok), to politicians like Scott Walker and Trump who advocate for shit tier policies, to lobbying for inaction against climate change via further reliance on fossil fuel. In this way the money is \"tainted.\" I think the real question is does the tainted money actually change the content of the PPEL program? The short answer is yes because (a) there is a clause about the foundation needing to approve of all hired faculty and graduate assistantships, and (b) there is some PPEL content that doesn't line up with the Foundation's mission (the point of the grant is to enable the foundation's mission of like informing people about free markets and increased freedom and stuff; read the mission yourself). Though, I'd guess that basically there'll be no actual interference from the foundation because the faculty who teach PPEL courses already have significant ideological overlap with the Koch ideology. If they (and a couple other non-PPEL profs) are who decide hiring and GAs to submit to the foundation for approval, chances are it'll already be aligned with the foundation. So in this way even though this is tainted money, it most likely won't directly change the program's content through direct intervention and leveraging economic gifts. \n\nI think the real sad thing in all of this is that the ideology of the PPEL department overlaps with the Koch ideology enough to get this funding. While within almost mainstream ideologies there is room to do good work, I think that criterion is took weak to establish the permissibility of having such an ideology. The Koch projects together make little sense as an ideology because on the one hand they advocate for more freedom yet fail to address massive threats to freedom such as climate change, patriarcal white supremacist norms within the worlds strongest governments and private enterprises (see the many nations having intra police groups aimed at white identity and anti minority), and expanded control of massively large private enterprises on the systems of the world (see how defense companies influence inter country violence). This is the ideology the department is aligned themselves with by taking this money. It is not clear that the PPEL department's ideological overlap with Koch is just a cherry picking of the best part, and that's what is worrisome to me.",

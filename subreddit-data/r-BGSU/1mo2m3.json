I went to the study abroad fair today and found a couple programs that seem interesting but I'd like a list of all the programs so I can research them more, without the fluff from the reps. The BG site has a search function but I'm not looking for anything specific, other than art, so that doesn't help me at all. Is there a list anywhere, or an office I can get one from?",

They were super helpful to me when I studied abroad. Pretty much tell them where you want to go and they'll lay out your options.\n\nThere's also a page on the BGSU website... I think its under student services.",

I don't have a specific location in mind but it has to be art related, preferably sculpture. And I don't want to go to Rome. I'll have to find the office and talk to a person about it :) Thank you!",

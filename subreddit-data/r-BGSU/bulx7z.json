    "postText": "What's the best way to find friends that hopefully doesn't involve bars or huge crowds? I am a huge introvert, with probably some social anxiety, but I just finished my first semester as a transfer student and none of the \"friendships\" really stuck. I did my best to talk to people, but it seemed like everyone kinda already had established friend groups. I'm a little older, but I'm not really interested in the drinking/partying scene. I play some video games and have been trying to work up the courage to go workout in the SRC to get into fitness.\n\nAny advice?",

I get the whole introvert type scene, so don\u2019t be afraid to just stick to your main small group of people that you feel most comfortable around. If you can simply relax and contribute to conversations and such with someone, that\u2019s often times a good sign of a nice friendship! Good luck to you!",

I would suggest both attending the student organization that is focused on your major and then looking out for special interests/hobby groups too.\n\nThe SRC is a great place to be active and work on getting into shape. No one there will be judging you because they\u2019ll be too focused on working out themselves. And anyone who does judge you isn\u2019t worth talking to. There are also some fitness classes and groups that you may find interesting.\n\nAlso, just talk to people. Who cares if other people have friends? There\u2019s always room for one more, especially if you build a meaningful relationship. If someone is wearing something with a character or franchise you like, compliment them on it. Asking for help in classes is a good way to get a study buddy.\n\nAnd, depending on your financial situation, getting a job forces you to talk to other people. I became friends with a good majority of my coworkers when I worked in dining services.",

I currently do not qualify to live off campus, but I feel like that's a waste of money considering I've lived on my own before. I'm planning to fill out a housing appeal but I'm curious what types of reasons are most commonly accepted. I've been told medical is a good way to go, but I don't have any serious medical problems and am told I will need a doctor's note as proof. Any suggestions?",

When I called I was told unless I successfully appealed I would have to live in a dorm which would also require me to purchase a meal plan.",

Living with family is the easiest excuse.\n\nWork with the school, they're not being heartless it's just their bureaucratic way. If you write an appeal and explain yourself I can't imagine they would just outright say no.",

In my personal appeal I just said that I have a job off campus, so access to a car is difficult if I am living in the dorms. I also talked about the price of living in a dorm. You can also talk about how the meal plan does not suit your health needs(so it would be a waste of money).",

After your 2nd year you can move off campus or if you live within 50 miles of campus you don't have to live in the dorms your first years. Kinda seems like they're trying to trick you into being on campus to get more money out of you.\n\nYou should have no problem getting out of this. ",

    "postText": "Hey guys. I'm a second year senior that will be student teaching next semester. Because of some personal events, my finance and I are moving our wedding up to next month. I currently have a job, but I think I'll need about $200-300 a month more, which in the grand scheme isn't that much. Does anyone know any place hiring part time for just a few hours a week? My current job is a campus job, so I need to not work another campus job so I don't go over hours (I also don't want to quit this job because it's very conducive for what I'll need to do while student teaching). Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks!",

On a good night, I can walk out with an extra $50 in my pocket. Mostly weekend work, however, and the season is starting to slim down. Come springtime, though, you'll have work every weekend.",

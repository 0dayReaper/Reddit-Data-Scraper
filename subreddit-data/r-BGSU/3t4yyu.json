I acutally used to run the Zen Fellowship before I graduated and we held Meditation off campus (less than a block away from Founders) at The Common Good, which is a house who's doors are always open (and lived in) that is used for tons of various events and community cooks/gatherings (https://www.facebook.com/The-Common-Good-148883698463333/?fref=ts). The people who used to run the other meditation times during the week also are high level members of the Toledo Buddhist Temple (http://www.buddhisttempleoftoledo.org/)  I'd go see if they are still holding regular meditation during the day/evening at the common good.",

I know the guy who runs the Meditation daily at Common Good and it used to be very structured. Not knocking either, it really is all about what you want out of your practice! I wish you luck :)",

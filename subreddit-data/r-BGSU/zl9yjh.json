(the name escapes me) and the research i was involved in at life science was also very cool! try new things and dont look back!\n\ntalons up!",

            "comment": "Alright some of these posts seem slightly biased. Greek life is still good at bg, it\u2019s not what it used to be like 4 years ago, but at the same time you don\u2019t have to worry about being severely miss treated. All of the major frats (there\u2019s like 6 big ones) party frequently or have something going on each weekend. All the fraternities are involved in philanthropy and service events. Greek life is a huge community and if you would want to be apart of something that like that I\u2019d highly recommend rushing",

This shouldn\u2019t shake you from Greek life. I woudl reccomend formal rush so you have a chance to see all the organizations if you wanted to rush.",

They are a religious cult that has deep roots in the college. I hope one day upper management understands the negative impact they have had on the student body and community and removes them once and for all. But until that time, be careful. They might seem nice at first but at the end of the day this organization is a highly functioning and highly funded cult.",

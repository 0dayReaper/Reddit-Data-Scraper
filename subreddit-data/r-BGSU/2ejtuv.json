    "postText": "Odd request, but I'm looking for someone with a pickup truck that can help me move an arcade cabinet from my old house on Wooster to falcons pointe. I'd do it myself but balancing a box spring on top of my Camry is about as dangerous as I want to get. \n\nIf someone has a half hour and wants to help, I'd be very appreciative. Unfortunately I can't pay someone to help, but I figured I'd ask. Thanks! :-)",

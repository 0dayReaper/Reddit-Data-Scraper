More so, I am looking into why it was so important to so many people. If there is anybody who would like to talk to me about this and be a part of this documentary, please let me know!",

It was the first president's house and it held the popular culture for much of living memory.  \n\nOn the other side of the ball though, it was an old small building.  It was difficult to heat, and it was hard to keep connected to the network and utilities of BGSU given that it was across Wooster.",

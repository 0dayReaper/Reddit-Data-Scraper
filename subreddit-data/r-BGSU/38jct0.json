    "postText": "I am hoping that someone at BGSU (if anyone is still there during the summer) can help me get some information from a book there: Behind the Sun about Hillel Slovak. I need to get some photos/scans of the artwork in the book, which is hard to find and does not seem to be accessible through any library request. I am in Boston and trying to avoid buying the book. So if anybody's bored and wants to go on a library adventure, I would appreciate it very much.",

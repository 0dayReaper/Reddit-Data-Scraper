    "postText": "So, I'm going to be transferring into BG from one of the satellite campuses this Fall.  I'll be entering into my sophomore year and me, being irresponsible, I have yet to pay my deposit to be put into student dorms mostly because I haven't had the money to.  So would it be too late to be put into dorms at this point?  Also, is there any realistic way to get around the housing policy and live off campus in a house?",

In essence lie through your teeth. The dorms blow and living off campus is far more rewarding, educational and affordable (assuming you use your refund check for bills not weed).",

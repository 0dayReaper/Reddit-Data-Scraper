    "postText": "The other day, I was doing some random internet searching and learned that the BGSU baseball program, with the help of alumni (including BGSU's most famous baseball player, the Bulldog, Orel Hershiser) has saved the program, for what appears to be at least three years.\n\nAs an alumni, I am so happy to hear this!  Anyway, attached is an article on this, however there are other articles on the Internet that confirms it, as well as the office BGSU baseball twitter (and the athletics department!).  Just shows how important BGSU athletics are!\n\nhttps://www.13abc.com/content/news/BGSU-Baseball-saved-570962091.html",

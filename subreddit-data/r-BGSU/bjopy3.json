There are plenty of people in the program who do bare minimum and dont know much leaving, but they're are plenty of people who leave well prepared. If you have any specific questions, feel free to message me!",

Lower level classes are a bit rough because you have a bunch of non cs majors in your group projects but overall my professors were good. If I remember correctly(it\u2019s been awhile since I was there), the head of the CS department was working on a \u201cnew internet\u201d or something weird like that \ud83d\ude02",

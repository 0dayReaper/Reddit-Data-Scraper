These fliers are in the process of being taken down. ",

Last semester we had the event in April and it was the first TEDxBGSU event since 2007. due to lack of time, we weren\u2019t able to be a student organization but this year we are a registered student org and have a whole team of students planning the event! We plan to keep the org going and have a new TEDxBGSU event every year with a different theme. Last year\u2019s theme was Affinity and this year\u2019s theme is Odyssey! We can always use more hands so if you\u2019re interested in getting involved, look up TEDxBGSU on orgsync or pm me :-) ",

Content of the flyer is the first bit from here: \nhttp://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1860871_1860876_1861029,00.html\n\nLooked at University of Oxford's staff page and they have 3 Thomas H. Sheridans, no Thomas A. Sheridan:\nhttp://www.ox.ac.uk/staff\n\nLastly, Wikipedia has the 2010 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize as Liu Xiaobo:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Nobel_Peace_Prize\n\nThis has to be a joke, right?\n\nEDIT: Name of professor is a BGSU student. Most certainly a joke.",

Like what halls do people try really hard to get while picking rooms?\n\nI have a feeling the 3 big ones on my list are probably the most popular so i just want to know if i should start looking for backups for my backups.",

If you\u2019re a loner go live in centennial. if you want to live in a prison live in conklin. founders has way too small of rooms unless it it\u2019s the 6 person ones on the window corners.",

So 80% of people who get selected to live there were international students who can barely speak English. \n\nOne of the few people I met in that hall was some guy from the UK since he was the only person able to socialize.\n\nThe dorm rooms had mold, causing recurring ear infections until I moved.\n\nThe size was mediocre and not really worth mentioning. \n\nOnly nice thing was being near the food hall. Other than that, folks in Centennial made me jealous.",

If you're in sciences, try to get into the learning community in that building. It helps guarantee you a room in one of the towers, and gets you access to a nicer kitchen, another lounge, and free printing.",

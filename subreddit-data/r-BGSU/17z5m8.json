            "comment": "Honestly as a transfer student you may want the same advice as a freshman. The thing that sucks about transferring (and grad school) is that you don't really meet anyone, because everyone already has a group of friends. It may seem odd to live in a dorm like Harshman or Kreischer and hang out with freshmen or sophomores, but it's better than transferring in and living in a dorm where no one talks to anyone around them. That's why I never liked offenhauer or founders, no one wanted to meet any new people.",

            "comment": "If you don't want to be around freshmen all the time, try Falcon Heights or Offenhaur. Both are upper class dorms Falcon Heights is newer and nicer. Suite style versus standard dorm rooms so you get more living space but also more roommates. Both of these dorms do tend to be full of either loud douche bags or quiet, already settled, almost anti-social others. If your goal is to get to know other people try one of the other dorms with underclassmen who still try to get to know everyone they can. ",

If you can't get in one of those Offenhaur isn't bad either, the rooms are pretty big, it has air conditioning, and there is a convenience store on the first floor. ",

Steve Smith is a fair landlord his office is on manville next to all those concrete cylinders across the street from the end of fifth. If your looking to live on the cheap there is a building at 843 6th st. two bedrooms two full baths, the Only bad side is its run by the bad Newlove rental company (but that old bitch Hellen who ran the office retired a few years back so it may be better now) rent was $420 when i lived there The numbered streets are usually pretty happening but lock your car doors at night ",

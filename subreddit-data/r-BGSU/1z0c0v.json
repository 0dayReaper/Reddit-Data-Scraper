What's it like out here during the summer?  Are the bars busy on the weekends, if at all?  Might not have a roommate so I'm definitely hoping there'll be some shit going on out here because most all of my friends move back home during the summer. Any insight would be helpful!",

The farmers market is great, the quarry is nice now and then.  I dunno, I loved being here last summer and will again this summer",

Most of the students were gone, but there were some guys I knew, but I wasn't really good friends with, who were still in town, and we ended up becoming good friends. There were enough students left to keep it interesting. The second summer I was there was a really bad summer for the economy, and a lot of people didn't stay in town because they couldn't find work. I think there was one person that I even vaguely knew left in the town, so it got a little boring at times, but it was still calm and enjoyable being there. In general it's pretty awesome to be there in the summer, and worst case scenario is that it's peaceful and maybe a little boring, and it will force you to make new friends. Worth the risk in my book. ",

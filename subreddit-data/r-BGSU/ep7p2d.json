Bc historically and there is some truth to it, that they\u2019re douche bags. But every university chapter is different.\n\nLike I said depends on your personality. Some Fraternity\u2019s at BG are similar and some are way out there. I highly recommend it.",

I've got friends across the state in fraternities and they're no where near the level of BG's.\n\nIf you're looking to rush next fall make sure you follow the fraternities on Twitter because they'll post their rush events on there. Also they will all be out during campus fest which is a good way to meet them. Parties are also a great way to meet the guys in the fraternities.\n\nGood luck, hope to see you rush next semester!",

There are always frat parties going on with every type of alcohol you could imagine, too. I can't speak for everyone else, but everyone was pretty nice on campus as well. Congrats on getting in!",

Great convenience and the parties are all in houses off campus, usually a fair number. Bring a 12er of beer or a bottle of liquor or give $10 to get in if you don't know anyone close in the frat.",

Head to enterprise street around 10:30 and you\u2019ll find plenty of them, same with off manville/troup. Bars are a 5 minute walk from campus and get busy around 11:30, liquid, tubbys and 149 have been the shit this year, shots is good and doggy\u2019s is more juniors/seniors. Biggest thing is city and university cops will write you open container and public pissing tickets that you have to go to court for, so be smart about that shit caus they watch for it",

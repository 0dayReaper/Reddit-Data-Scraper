Personally, I'm an atheist (shocking, I know), so I'm not really on either side, but given the choice, I'd rather hear someone preach what their religion is actually supposed to be about. The best option would obviously be for everyone to just go home and save it for church, but it's an option we don't really have. ",

Sure, it's unrealistic to think that this is going to make them give up. However, a lot of (if not all) of their \"preaching\" has to do with \"if you do/are xyz, you're going to hell and God hates you.\" For some people (obviously I'm avoiding it to make a general argument, but a prime example is would be someone who is gay, bi etc), it can get to you to keep hearing case over and over again. So maybe it shouldn't be about driving them off campus, but just reminding people, \"hey, these guys are assholes. They're spewing bullshit and we all know it.\"",

I don't listen for his message, mind you, but his technique. But then the crowd shows up and I'm reminded why we can't have nice things. \n\nWe're in college, people. Let's do some critical thinking and stop pretending a guy making a fool of himself is something worth getting angry over. ",

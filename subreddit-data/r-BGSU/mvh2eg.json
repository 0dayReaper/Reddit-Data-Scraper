            "comment": "I truly do not understand the purpose of walking around a campus that prohibits firearms with a longarm. For a significant portion of students, parents, and other people who see and hear about this (maybe even a majority), those carriers just look dumb as hell. I'd bet some of the people who witnessed these \"defectors\" felt threatened. How did they think that was going to have any positive consequences? I kind of think the no firearms policy might not be justified, but events like this make me want to support the policy out of pure spite. Obviously I'm not going to do that because I'm more principled than that, but how can they not understand that that's what many people's reaction is going to be without having *something* to countervail it?",

It\u2019s also not the first time this has happened. A similar group did the same thing back in 2016, except in that case it was actually an organized group of people. Ill post a link below this comment that talks more about it.\n\nhttps://bgindependentmedia.org/open-carry-walk-planned-in-bg-saturday/",

At least in that case it showed that there were a number of people who were against campus restrictions on carrying firearms on campus. I mean, it wasn't enough to really seem like there might be a real significant number of people who do, but it was at least more than just two people prowling around like mf schools shooters.",

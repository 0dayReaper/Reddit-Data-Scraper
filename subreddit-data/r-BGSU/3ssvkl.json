    "postText": "Some things to consider about writing as a career:\n\n-Highly competitive, highly saturated, highly critical\n\n-The majority of readers are writers themselves\n\n-Writing creatively only exists within its own community\n\n-The BFA program is intended to build and expand this community\n\n-Writing is no longer a good career move per se, which is why you must minor in something else\n\n-Failure, dissatisfaction and rejection are likely in the writing craft; learn to deal with them, push them aside and keep writing\n\nIf you are not ready to deal with failure, deal with rejection, deal with criticism and dissatisfaction;\n\nIf you are not ready to be part of a community which only holds the one purpose of listening, sharing and reading;\n\nIf you are not ready to face the fact that writing doesn't pay gunk unless you are lucky or a marketing genius;\n\nDon't choose the Creative Writing BFA. But if you are ready for all the above, and you feel that you have gold lying deep within your blood and it's just screaming to shoot out of your fingers, and you are ready to fight and learn and CREATE, and every fiber of your being urges you to constantly do so for fear of exploding,\n\nThen please come join our program. I can't wait to read your stuff. ",

Two currently work for publications, one for a quarterly, one for a magazine, the other one minored in marketing, and now has an advertising gig.\n\nAll three loved it.\n\nI'm guessing previous OP just wasn't very committed, or wasn't very good.",

Urban Meyer and Gregg Brandon were the coaches.  At the time, we had lots of great players....and though many were drafted or signed in the NFL, most never made it very far.  One did, Shaun Shuisham, who went on to a fairly successful career in the NFL (he\u2019s since retired).\n\nRegardless, though I always root for BGSU players.  It\u2019s great to see a player get a ring, and I hope he\u2019s successful for a long time.  Stats seem to show that he could be one of the most successful WRs in a long time to come out of BGSU in a long time, if not ever.",

I\u2019ve headlined shows in 30 states playing everything from theaters to punk basements to art galleries to beloved comedy clubs, I\u2019ve recorded 2 albums, and filmed a pilot for an Amazon Prime stand up show that has still not aired. I\u2019ve opened for Kyle Kinane, Rory Scovel, Sarah Sherman, Hari Kondabolu, rapper Open Mike Eagle, DJ Doug Pound and David Leibe Hart from Tim &amp; Eric, punk bands with silly names, and a guy at an open mic who tried to throw his father\u2019s ashes into the crowd. I promise I'm funny and interesting.\n\nHere\u2019s a lil clip: https://youtu.be/HYynck-qSJ8\n\nand here's my IG: https://www.instagram.com/goofydanalten/\n\nLet me know if there's cool stuff I should check out while I'm here",

It will be from may 6th to first of august rent is $299 a month and only have to pay utilities for gas and electric never more than $30 per person per month for both.  Living at the enclave you have a shuttle service to and from campus and since its summer you will have access to the pool and hopefully hot tub. There is also a gym, volleyball and basketball court available to you. Please respond on here or email me if you are interested or have any questions jschuli@falcon.bgsu.edu. Thank you",

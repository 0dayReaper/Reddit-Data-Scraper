I didn't know what to expect from my degree while I was at BGSU, but I feel like it paid off.  I work in a low income school which led to the federal government paying down $17,500 of my student loans(federal teacher loan forgiveness).  To future BGSU graduates, don't expect to get a job in Ohio after graduating...be open to moving out of state.  ",

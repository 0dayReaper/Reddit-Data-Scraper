    "postText": "I feel like everyone's supposed to love it and think it's wonderful, but personally, I have some issues with it. \n\nFirst, they want to \"foster a culture of giving that begins during a student's undergraduate career and continues for a lifetime.\" I don't think most students have a lot of extra money to just give to an institution that they're already paying a lot to. \n\nGoing off of that, if I'm going to give money to something right now, it's going to be to a cause that's actually needed. A new university gateway is in no way a necessity. \n\nWhy can't we keep old campus old? I understand that we used to have a gateway there and it's getting back to tradition, but the thing is, it's going to be *new*. It's a lot of concrete and I don't think it fits with the feel of that area. And instead of the area being closed in by buildings and having a more private feeling, it'll be open to Thurstin.\n\nWhy is it even called the Student Legacy Campaign? I feel like that's one of those names like the Patriot Act where you're like, \"Oh, I can't possibly oppose that. It sounds like a great thing.\" They tell you to \"leave your legacy\" and \"leave your mark\"... Really? Is any student really doing that by donating a few dollars? Yes, as a whole, students would be leaving something (I don't know that I'd call it a \"legacy\"), but individually? I don't think so. I'm not saying it's necessary for students to individually have recognition or glory or something here, but I do feel that sometimes the campaign is marketed in a way that makes it sound like individual students will be leaving their own legacy, which I don't think they will be.\n\nIf it seems like I don't understand something about this whole thing, let me know. Also, if anyone's concerned about the fact that my account is new - I've been around reddit for a while. I just didn't want to associate my main account with /r/BGSU on the off chance that someone I know might suspect my main account was me. BG would be a pretty big clue.\n\nThoughts? Do you support it, oppose it, not care?\n\n\n",

Especially as an art major that watched the college funnel heaps of money to shitty, losing sports programs, and as an RA that watched the college cover up egregious code of conduct violations (and broken laws) by connected students and varsity players.\n\nSo no, they're not getting a dime from me. If I'm wealthy some day I'll be happy to start a scholarship fund for BG art majors or something as long as the university bureaucracy isn't involved in any way.",

            "comment": "BGSU has gotten a little desperate with begging alumni (and now apparently current students) for money instead of cutting the fuck out of administrators pay.  At one point in my alumni life I donated money, through BGSU, to a specific on-campus org.  Generally I'd get a call once or maybe twice a year asking if I'd like to give again and I decline.  If I didn't answer, they didn't call back.  Every call was a bit more scripted then the last for the hard sell, trying a bit harder to part me and my money.  In the past week I've been called seven or eight times and haven't bothered to pick up (be wary of the 372 exchange).  \n\nYes, they're calling back because I haven't picked up, but I really don't want to have the long conversation with the polite but reading off a script undergrad who's trying to hard-sell me on a $500, no $200, no $100, no $75, no $50 donation today.  I have no loyalty to the institution because they've cultivated no loyalty.  I have fondness for people and programs from my time there, but none for the institution itself.  They did nothing to build the sort of culture that breeds an alumni who donates, and since I've left, they've done their level best to poison the well.\n\nMost of BGSU money woes can be traced back to a solid 30 year history of mismanagement of university infrastructure and an abuse of power by the administration.  Now, as the state unwisely slashes the fuck out of education budgets to pay for ridiculous things like tax cuts and \"economic improvement\" BGSU has to resort to begging more and more money out of an increasingly un-loyal alumni population and a collection of students who are paying one of the highest public school intuitions in the state.\n\nI had some hope that they'd be doing better under Mazey but, it's become more apparent that it's not just who sits in that chair's fault but the fault of the entire Board of Trustees who seem incapable of steering the university competently through a changing world.  Oh well.\n",

They're coming at it from the faculty cuts angle more than the loyalty issue or anything else, but I think you still might find it worth a read.\n\nIt's interesting, now that I think about it I don't really feel a loyalty to BGSU itself, and I don't see a reason why I should. As you said, I like some people and programs here, but that doesn't translate to an overall love of BGSU.\n\nAnd I do feel bad for those students calling for donations.

The Ohio State alumni network is incredibly robust and brings huge amounts of money into the institution.  Granted, they're the largest (or one of), but without loyalty of the base, they still don't rake in the money that they do.  People who went there have affection for their time there.  Their affection is for the same things we share, the people and programs, but the institution has injected themselves into the equation in such a way as to become part of the story, thus giving them leverage for their donation programs.  BGSU fails to do this time and time again, and in what is probably a legitimate hour of need they fail to make gains.",

I pay a lot of money to attend this school and as a member of a service organization I also end up paying a good amount to charities around the area. This has added up over the years and I would rather see my money go to events and causes rather than a decorative entrance.\n\nI am a transfer student from Kent state. I recently went back to visit a buddy of mine and they have spent a lot of money building a gateway to their downtown... it's awful. They turned a great little college town unto a yuppie paradise. It looks like levis commons and it was pretty controversial because they had to buy and tear down houses to build it. Personally I feel like this would be the same thing even though I know it doesn't go downtown or anything. It's going to be a cluster to build and then when it's finished people will complain about it for a few years then it will seem normal as new people come in.\n\nI think if they want to gain the support of students they should either revitalize the spaces they have like they've recently been doing in olscamp by getting rid of those god awful squeaky attached chairs. So much of the money they are spending feels like it's going to certain departments or feels unnecessary to the general student population. Did we need a new health center? Do the greeks really need to have all their buildings torn down to make new ones?\n\nOne thing I have heard rumors of that I approve of is getting rid of that tiny road that cuts through by the oaks/union/mac. The road used to go straight through campus and it got turned into a huge sidewalk. I think they should keep the road part by the oaks/union for deliveries and move in then get rid of the other part to make the campus feel more connected. (not by just putting in a giant sidewalk either)\n\nsorry that was a rant but I don't care for it but I don't oppose it because I'm leaving soon and newer generations will see it as normal as time goes by.",

But that's really where it needs to stop with that area of campus, any other improvements there will just ruin the feel of that area.\n\nRemoving Ridge St. makes it hard for emergency vehicles to get to Olscamp and that inner area of campus.  When they first closed that section of Ridge off there was a bunch of questions about emergency services to that side of campus, and the debate began again when the erected the concrete bollards between Hayes and Overman.\n\nThe changes that have happened to campus since I was a freshman there in 2002 are amazing.  So, you're right, once you're out it doesn't matter, what they're doing is for the next class, but current students do get some say in the matter, some input on what they think would be best for the future of the institution.  For my class generation it was dorms and dining halls, and both situations have been drastically changed for the better.",

Miami's a beautiful campus, for example, but it'd be even more beautiful if you didn't have to cross the street so often. ",

I don't think it's a secret a lot of our programs are in shambles and under-funded.  Expanding the university's student population while shrinking the faculty size is the exact opposite of that.  In my opinion, this impending faculty cut is just absolutely ridiculous.  It's just mind-blowing to think an administration with most (if not all) members making well into 6 digits are cutting 100 faculty members without seeing any pay reductions (or salary increase freezes, mind you) of their own.  I think a hard working administration deserves high pay, but only if there is a balance achieved between the administration and faculty.  Too often the administration has put what attracts prospective students (fancy buildings, renovations, etc) over the needs of current students.  A good business model, but universities are not businesses.\n\nThe only problem with rebuilding and bettering academic programs as a legacy is that you cannot slap a commemorative plaque on an academic program and call it your own.  \n\nIn addition to just pushing funding into programs, we need to strengthen our academic standards.  I appreciate the push for inclusive education, but honestly, liberal arts - based universities need some amount of exclusivity.  It's how they attract and retain good professors.  Admitting practically any student does nothing but create a low work expectation.  \n\nI think a start would be to direct fundraising efforts specifically at solving our academic problems.  Whenever we hear about a new building or renovation, students always begin to complain about using their tuition money for frivolous things, but we're mostly sated when we hear \"the money came from private donations\" (kept hearing this for the renovations to the union).  But these private donations only came because the university actively sought them in their fundraising campaigns.  I guarantee no one said, \"You know what my alma matter needs?  A fancier union!\"  A goal was set by the administration and they focused their efforts on it, but they could have just as easily tackled some general program issues throughout the university.",

Centers like the learning commons and the academic resource center help provide specialized instruction to students who need extra assistance without wasting valuable faculty time on trying to manage a diverse student body.  There are many studies that show even in advanced subjects like calculus, a large lecture course with individual tutoring available to single students as needed can be just as effective as smaller classes with more time spent by more instructors on the same content.  Some administrative staff may be paid too high, but I do not know of many administrative staff members who are not earning their salary.  Running a university is a difficult job in the best of times, but in an age of ultra competition and a 70% reduction in state funding to higher education over the last two decades, sometimes the right staff can make all the difference.\n\nCutting faculty positions is a hard choice, but I don't know that anyone has strong evidence to say it is absolutely the wrong one.  It may end up being a big risk that does not pay off, or it may help BGSU focus more of its time on non-classroom instruction and individual focus through the aforementioned centers and programs.\n\nBuilding new residence halls and dining centers was something that most everyone agrees had to happen.  Buildings like McDonald, Harshmen and Kohl may be steeped in history, but they don't sell many incoming students to BGSU in the way that the new Residence Halls do.  The Stroh Center was funded heavily by private donations, as was the Wolfe Center.  These buildings also provide a huge draw in their respective areas for new students to attend BGSU.  While they may not have been unnecessary, it is hard to turn down a donation that would cover such a large portion of a new arena or center for the arts.",

No one is doubting that, and sure, classes like calculus might be able to be taught in large lectures without much negative consequences.  However, in discussion oriented classes at the 3000/4000 level need to be in small groups.  It's just common sense.  If the classes are large, it can be chaotic.  It stifles discussion, and it also leads to most students believing they can get away with not doing the reading.  When the classroom experience is small and intimate, the students establish a relationship with the professor and with the course content, and the result can be a great learning experience.  Faculty cuts and student population expansion will make these experiences more and more rare.\n\nIt is a hard choice; I really don't think the administration has done this lightly.  That being said, you mentioned you haven't seen any evidence that this is the wrong choice.  Have you seen any evidence it's the right one? No, because there has been little information released about the whole thing. Personally, I would expect to see a full financial review available to the public when such a cut is being made, but that hasn't happened.  \n\nI do agree with you about the new residence halls. These buildings needed to be replaced, and I think the Wolfe Center was necessary to an extent. As for the Stroh, I don't think it was necessary at all, and like I said earlier, these donations were pandered for. The administration decided a new arena was necessary and worked for it by asking for donations from alumni.  What if some foresight had been shown and they had focused their efforts on improving academics and raising funds to retain faculty? I'd rather have the 100 faculty members than a shiny building.",

Sure they both appear on a line item budget for a single year, but that is really where the similarities end.  Anderson Arena was over 50 years old when Stroh opened.  Stroh hosts a good number of events, all of which help it pay for itself slowly, which it has been for the entire time it has been opened.\n\nIn addition, Sports programs are surprisingly important for general enrollment.  As someone who came to school for academics, and really has little interest in basketball, I don't like to admit it, but a lot of perspective students are influenced by sporting programs.  There was a large uptick in enrollment after the Football program won a fairly major bowl in the early 2000s, and many students indicated watching the game on national TV was their first exposure to BGSU.  On top of all of that, outside of new buildings, most sports pay for themselves in ticket sales and money from the NCAA.\n\nI don't know of the evidence either way, I just know that at this point both sides of the argument are largely speculative.  Speculative arguments are really, really silly and I am sorry for even starting one like that.\n\nI don't have a response for either of your first two paragraphs and I think we both know that is because there is just no evidence either way.

Something like 80% of the budget comes from tuition.  So increasing enrollment is the best and easiest way to increase the amount of money BGSU has to spend.  This effect was doubled down for most of the last decade by the fact that the total amount of state funding we did receive was based on total enrollment.  So, as Athletics at BGSU are mostly solvent on their own, and they show a positive relation to increasing enrollment, fund raising and fighting for athletic buildings is a budgetary no-brainer. \n\nAlso, the money for Stroh was sought after as early 2006 and 2007, when economic times were not so bad.  Once the donation was on the table, BGSU made the choice to fund the project by increasing tuition on students enrolled around that time.  Almost no amount of the budget for Stroh came from the general fund as it stood in 2007.  On top of all of that, again, the Stroh is already on a path to becoming profitable.  Concerts and events are hosted all the time at the Stroh which are already starting to pay back the cost of the building and eventually it will be making BGSU money.  \n\nLastly, and most importantly, the Stroh is a finished part of BGSU.  We can no longer choose to just get rid of it.  The state of ohio cut overall funding levels for higher education again this year, something it has been doing pretty much every year.  While, again, I do not know if cutting 100 teacher positions is the best way to meet the budget gap, nothing to do with Stroh is going to fix the gap either.\n\nDo you have any other suggestions on how to close the budget gap?  The 100 teacher plans saves just over 5 million dollars.  What are some alternatives to saving that 5 million? ",

The university has an endowment of about 120 million, so I think it's necessary to prove that these monetary funds simply do not exist.  If they do and the university is just looking for ways to cut spending, then cutting faculty is an extremely unethical choice in my opinion.  In fact based on the budget breakdown you gave, it would seem the university should have more cash than ever before because enrollment has been increasing for the past few years.\n\nAs for coming up with 5 million dollars, I'm not necessarily saying it has to be an all or nothing scenario.  While I would like to see all 100 positions retained, perhaps this isn't possible.  In that case, I think there are little things that could be manipulated to maintain funding for about half of these positions.  Administrative salary freezes and possibly salary reductions are reasonable.  Considering faculty salary freezes and salary reductions have been happening for the past few years, I think it's reasonable to say it's the administration's turn.  A small tuition increase of like $10 per semester per student could save 2 or more positions.  Small athletic cuts.  Direct fundraising efforts at faculty retention.  Small cuts across the board could have a smaller impact on the students than seeing the faculty size decrease so dramatically.",

If you aren\u2019t going to live in the Founders learning community, I wouldn\u2019t bother. I didn\u2019t, so I dont get most of the benefits of actually being in honors.\nThat said, there are people who love it and there is a good community to be had if you look for it!",

These are just based on what the people I knew experienced and that I remember\n\n\nHope this helps!",

            "comment": "Living in Founders and being in the HLC was a great community for me when I started school, I graduated 4 years ago and still talk to my freshman year roommates daily, hell we even took an international vacation last year before the pandemic and all. Nothing wrong with any of the other learning communities but the Honors dorms are the nicest first year dorms on campus barring Falcon Heights. The HLC does some cool trips at virtually no cost to you as well, although I never was able to go on them because of my program (I majored in music so not a lot of free weekends).\n\nThe Critical Thinking classes are definitely much more demanding than anything I took in high school but in hindsight I probably learned more in those classes than any single other college course. Those can be kind of a crapshoot depending on the prof. Dr. Diehl and Dr. Thompson I have heard are great (I had Diehl and had Thompson for other courses) and from what I've heard Dr. Brown is one to avoid.\n\nIn terms of practicality, the Honors College gives you an additional $1000 dollar scholarship a year at least, and opens up the door for many more scholarship opportunities. I actually was only able to qualify for the full-tuition scholarship I ended up receiving because I was in the HLC.\n\nHonors classes can vary wildly in terms of department and professor outside of the Honors College. I took my public speaking class as an Honors course, and had the best professor in the department teaching a class of about 30 twice a week rather than a 150 person lecture, which was excellent. In the music college the honors version of the courses were just an extra research project and presentation, which was at 4p on the last Friday of the term... You will get a good idea of what classes you want to take depending on your department, just ask around (your friends in the HLC will fill you in on the details).\n\nThe important thing to remember is that being in the Honors Program and earning an Honors Diploma are two different things. To earn the diploma you have to attain so many Honors credits and do a two-semester long capstone project you design with a faculty advisor you choose. It is a lot of work but can be great for your education and career. I ended up deciding that the diploma wasn't a reasonable priority for me to graduate, so I never earned it. Still got all the perks for my entire time there, and graduated with Latin honors, just no Honors diploma.\n\nTl;dr It is more work than a regular degree but in a lot of ways you get much better access to your area, it saves you $1k a year, and you can make great things with it academically and socially. I think it's the smart move, and it's a lot less pressure than you might think.",

            "comment": "I was in the HC my Freshman year. \n\nIt depends on who you are and who you're trying to be. Your high school valedictorian will be the average, and you will be expected to keep up. No matter what they say, they will not teach you how to be successful. They group all of the already successful students together and then take credit. It's largely an exercise in tautology (I'm a good student because I'm in the HC, and the HC is noteworthy because it's full of good students). But I've heard it's good on resumes.",

            "comment": "Hi, current Honors student here!\n\nI'm sure you know about the perks of graduating with an Honors diploma, so I won't go into that, just the current experience of it while being a student.     \n\n\nThe Main Perks:   \n\nPriority Scheduling - I'm not gonna lie, this one is pretty good. Basically how scheduling works at BG is that everyone, depending on their grade level (freshman, sophomore, etc) get assigned a date and time when they can start signing up for classes online. Honors students get bumped up one level, so Honors freshman get to sign up at the same time as non-Honors sophomores and so one. This is pretty damn all the time as you generally get a good pick of class times, professors, etc and is especially great when you get to higher level classes cuz those can fill up quickly and sometimes only one section of a class you need is being offered at a time.\n\nHonors Learning Community - this is technically different than the Honors College, but the Honors College gets you access so I'll count it (although Honors students can pull non-Honors students in if you wanna room with someone who isn't Honors). The main perk of this right now is being able to live in Founders Hall, which is a dorm building with suites and AC and a small market in the basement of it. Its also where you'll have some classes your freshman year (the mandatory Honors \"Critical Thinking\" classes) and your Honors advisor. Its a bit more expensive to live there since you have to pay the Learning Community fee as well, but the HLC also has activities like small trips (Chicago, plays, museums, etc), raffles, and just fun stuff to do like trivia or craft nights or yoga. So if you really take advantage of those it pays for itself, plus the building is just nice. If I'm being totally honest I wouldn't recommend it freshman year purely because (in my experience at least) it was a super social place- everyone kinda just stayed in their rooms and didn't talk to each other, which is the opposite of what I experienced my freshman year living in Kohl Hall, but thats just me personally. \n\nThe Bonus Money - the Honors College sometimes gives their students $2000-$2500 to put toward studying abroad, which is obviously pretty cool\nHonors Advisors - each Honors student gets their own Honors advisor. This can be nice as they divide up students by major rather than last name, so your Honors advisor may know more about your program than your regular one. You also have a better chance of forming a relationship with them as they have less students to deal with. I'll admit I maybe a bit biased because my advisor was absolutely amazing (they are unfortunately no longer at BG), but this was a huge plus for me.     \n\n\nBad Stuff:\n\nCritical Thinking Classes - all depends on the professor you get, but these can be rough. You have to take 2 (HNRS 2010 AND 2020) your freshman year and they can have some absolutely insane workloads. Each section is taught by a different prof and they choose the curriculum, so make sure you look at what they are before choosing.     \n\nThe Honors Project - massive research project/paper you have to complete to graduate with Honors. I havent done mine yet honestly, but I'm not looking forward to it. This is the main reason people end up dropping Honors sometimes.     \n\nHonors Credits - you have to take a certain amount of \"Honors credits\" to graduate. 8 of these will be the aforementioned Critical Thinking classes and the 2 credit \"intro to college\" course your freshman year, but the rest will be taking \"Honors versions\" of other classes. In my experiences these are combines with regular classes and you will just have to do an extra project/assignment, will be held to a higher standard, or there maybe no difference at all. More of an inconvenience than a real issue, honestly.     \n\n\nOne other thing I will say is that all my experiences and opinions are gonna be relative. I started in 2018 in a pre-COVID world. Everything is different now- places like Kohl I'm sure isnt as social as they used to be, the HLC events are pretty much exclusively virtual, and no one knows what the future of the Study Abroad program might be. So keep all that in mind, and take my experiences with a grain of salt.     \n\nI hope the stuff I've said has helped, but ultimately it's your decision and if you do decide to go with Honors you can drop at any time! If you have any more questions feel free to message me on here, Im still a junior at BG now so I can try to answer any questions you have. Good luck!\n\n\nEdits: spacing/formatting",

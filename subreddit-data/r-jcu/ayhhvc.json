I'm new to the area and don't know anyone here yet who can help.  Anyone willing to come over and help me for $20?  Should take under 10 minutes.  \n\nAnd, if you're willing to help with future craigslist purchases as I buy furniture, would be happy to keep the ball rolling for extra cash.\n\n\nThanks!",

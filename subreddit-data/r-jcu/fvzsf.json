    "postText": "So my friends history teacher sent out an email the other day regarding normal class information. At the end of the message he went ahead and attached a .doc of every video game he owns / has played. The [file was 13 pages long!!!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bgC-L7Q_Qua7WYBNGkI_JS0i1Cwa4ZWEicINGKqzelM/edit?hl=en) Go ahead and take a look yourself, it's quite the read. Note that he even names his house \"Le Ch\u00e2teau des Citrouilles\".\n\n\"P.S. As some of you talked with me before or after class about my PlayStation 3...well, I spent the last few hours dealing with Sony and it suffered an internal failure. According to Sony it has to be replaced and all data is lost, i.e. the last four years worth of game saves, including beating Resident Evil 5, Dante's Inferno, God of War 3, God of War Collection, all games in the Karaoke Revolution series, all games in the Guitar Hero series, all games in the Rock Band series, various pinball games, etc. (I am attaching a list of my video games for the curious). Apparently this save data is unrecoverable due to the nature of the internal failure of the system. At least I am getting a new system from them though...in a few weeks!? Well, I guess I will not be distracted grading midterms then...\"\n\n\n",

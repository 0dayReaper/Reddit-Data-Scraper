Our department has [an upcoming talk](https://i.imgur.com/OuxISId.jpg) on Thursday, October 4 at 5:30 pm in the Marinello Little Theater that is free and open to the public. The speaker is a JCU alum, and we're super excited.\n\nIn fact, most talks at JCU are open to the public. One way to find other events is to visit [Inside JCU](http://inside.jcu.edu/). Since you have specific interests in mind, also check out departmental websites, both their JCU webpages and their social media; you can usually find events that way as well.\n\nGood luck!",

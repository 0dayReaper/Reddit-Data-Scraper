I wonder if there's any real good way to boost the number of readers.. Last year I was telling a friend it'd be great if the school had some kind of internet forum or something to help with the socially awkward commuter like me.. but HEY, ALL!! :3 Hope everyone has a good one, and good luck with finals!! Also, if any other socially awkward redditors from john carroll want someone to hang out with next semester, hit me up (pm me)",

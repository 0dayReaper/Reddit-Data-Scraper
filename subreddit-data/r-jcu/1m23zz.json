I think we can try to make this a thing. People will hear about the JCU sub and come here to see whats up, ie we can blast our friends (not obnoxiously) on FB and Twitter, if you're into that sort of thing. Once they come, they will get hooked. \n\nWe can post parties, meet up IRL, come on guys the possibilities are endless!\n\nI think it could be really cool, and it would provide a place for kids to speak there minds with a degree of anonymity. I'll make to really carefully mod, so it doesn't get out of hand, and as far as I'm concerned we should be talking about zero tolerance policies for harassment, etc...but that's a conversation for another time. \n\nWhat do you guys think?",

Other universities have all kinds of correspondence going on, from questions about professors, activities, blah, blah.  It's depressing to see the most recent posts be from months ago about football alumni.  It's up to you people who are still there to get things moving and give JCU a presence here.  Good Luck.",

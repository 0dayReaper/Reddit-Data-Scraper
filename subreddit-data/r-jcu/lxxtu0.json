            "comment": "To answer your questions:\n\n1. They will probably axe the department. With no real major there, and it's mostly there to fulfill some core requirements, there's no need for several tenured faculty there and the school will look to cut the dept.\n\n2. Basically, the faculty have a handbook, which is like their set of rules and regulations they've negotiated with the administration. In the  handbook are rules about how they can terminate faculty members. If you have tenure, there were a separate set of rules. \n\nThe admin and board wanted to change the handbook to say that the admin cut basically fire tenured faculty in times of \"financial exigency,\" which means really bad budget situation. The worst of times. \n\nThe board then went and has now changed that terminology to a budget situation that's not as bad as \"exigency.\" So if times are a little tight, they can more easily get rid of tenured faculty with much less hassle than exigency. \n\nMy guess is they will use this to get rid of programs that aren't making money and either expand programs that are (Boler, for example) or add new programs (nursing, engineering) that are programs that bring in more students (who will pay more.) \n\nIf you haven't, I'd recommend reading the most recent Strategic Plan here: [https://jcu.edu/president/key-initiatives/university-strategic-plan](https://jcu.edu/president/key-initiatives/university-strategic-plan). It talks about doing an academic review of programs to see what's struggling and what programs they can bring in to help plug budget holes.",

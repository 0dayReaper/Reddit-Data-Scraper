    "postText": "Hello! I'm a 24-year-old female young professional, and I recently purchased a 3-bedroom home in University Heights. I am renting out the 2 spare bedrooms. The bedrooms are 14x10 and 13x11, and I will be renting them out for $525/month each, all utilities included. 1 garage space is available for an additional $25/month. No pets, please, and females only. The house is within walking distance of public transportation, parks, John Carroll, Target, Whole Foods, and many other amenities. It's a 10-minute drive to Coventry, Case/University Circle, and Little Italy, and a 20-minute drive to downtown. Please e-mail me at nicolerh2010@gmail.com or PM me for additional details and pictures. I look forward to hearing from you!",

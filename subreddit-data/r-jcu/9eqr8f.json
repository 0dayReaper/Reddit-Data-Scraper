The event on September 27th is sponsored by the Woefl Seminar in Public Policy, the Department of Political Science, and Students for Social Justice at John Carroll University\n\nThe idea behind the series is to select different topics of interest for the community where civic discourse and conversation emerges sparked by panel sessions, guest lectures, Q&amp;A, or any number of other conversational modalities.\n\nThis month's event is co-sponsored by Students for Social Justice and is just one part of a broader week-long effort on campus. Have a look at the flyers around campus to get a sense for what this will be about. We hope that you will join us!",

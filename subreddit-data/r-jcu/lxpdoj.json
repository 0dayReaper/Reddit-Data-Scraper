Safe.\n\nAn old industrial city that has seen better days but still has pockets of bliss.\n\nLake Erie &amp; downtown are cool.\n\nIf you like pierogies, West End Market is FIRE!\n\nIf you like medieval armor &amp; armaments, Case Western museum...  OMG!\n\nCareful what neighborhood you tread &amp; be safe on the train.",

JCU is located in what we would consider the better part of the east side but not very far from \u201cbad\u201d areas. University Heights is where JCU is and it\u2019s very nice. \n\nWeather is all over the place. Very cold and snowy winters and hot summers. \n\nWe experience all seasons. \n\nMany places are developing (some done developing) into a more modern younger crowds. \n\nOverall nice place. But I am bias since I live here haha",

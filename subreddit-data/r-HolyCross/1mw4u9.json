            "comment": "Over BC and Fordham, I would still choose HC, the general feel of the campus is a lot nicer and depending on what you do you'll have a lot of free time or not (Ie. science majors with massive 3hours labs have a lot on their plates, other majors not as much). It's a lot of work but also pretty beneficial in the long run the people and friends you'll meet are pretty great. I'd check out the student blogs from both schools and see which one you'd kind of get the campus feel for. As always if you come here, I'm still around for another year so I can show you around and stuff :). Although I'll be a senior, I'm not the party type and more of your stereotypical redditor (games, reddit, games), though I don't really consider myself that socially awkward...but if you're looking for the party scene my friends can take you out, and it's not hard to get into a party once you know someone.

If you're looking to be a part of the Jesuit community, HC is definitely for you and even if you're not like me you can just ignore the emails and go on about your day, it's not in your face Christianity.

And since its such a small school, you see pretty much everybody. Obviously the academics are great. Regardless of what you're interested in, you'll have great professors if you manage your time well, you'll have loads of free time to do whatever you please. Feel free to pm me if you have any more questions, good luck with your decision!",

            "comment": "Like the others have said here, I don't regret coming to HC one bit. I'm also a sophomore and couldn't wait to return to campus after the summer break. As a college student, you may assume you'll always feel a bit homesick or uncomfortable living with all these random people, but at HC you feel so connected with everyone its not an issue. The size of HC was perfect for me. I see familiar faces everywhere, but by no means do I know everyone's names. You are constantly meeting new friends and seeing current ones. Academically, HC is certainly challenging, but absolutely doable. All the professors get to know your name and unlike BC, there are only undergraduates here. That means all their attention and research opportunities go to us! Overall, I love Holy Cross and I can guarantee any other student here would say the same thing",

    "postText": "What would be a Montserrat class you would recommend to upcoming first year students to take? I know some people have bad experiences and others have great experiences, so what are some good ones you would recommend taking? I'd recommend to do this in terms of easiness/difficulty, interesting material, and professor quality. \n\nIf you know what cluster/dorm you were in as well that might be useful. \n\nThanks for the help Saders!",

            "comment": "Hey I would say that when picking a monseratt its almost more important to make sure you have the right professor than the right class.  With the nature of the seminar you're gonna be spending a lot of time with them and they could be teaching the most interesting thing ever but if they are boring or too hard the class is gonna suck.  I was in Hanselman in the Global cluster with prof Conley which I enjoyed but idk if she's still doing monseratt ",

If you have an idea about what you're going to major in make sure not to take a Montserrat class that would fulfill a requirement for that department. I made this mistake. Being a math major and premed, taking a math Montserrat took up two semesters of class that won't count towards my major so they just took up space that I could've used to fulfill other requirements. That being said, I enjoyed my Montserrat class and it was really easy but it was still a bad choice. ",

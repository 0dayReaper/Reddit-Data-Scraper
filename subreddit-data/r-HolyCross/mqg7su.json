That\u2019s probably your best chance to see a moose. There has been an Ice climbing trip led each year with a small (6ish) number of people. I went my freshman and sophomore year and the second time around we stopped at a brewery for dinner afterwards. Very cute town and there was a moose just chilling in the road going into town causing traffic as it slowly crossed. Not saying the chances are high but it\u2019s possible\n\nEdit:\nJoin the outdoors club and find out who is on the eboard and hence leading the trips. Then make it known that you are super interested in hiking/doing a moose tour in VT/NH. The more friends you can gather interested in going the better. Just be consistent the club should be down to go, you could even offer leading the trip you just need to rent a van and have a student who is van certified to drive.",

    "postText": "Hi! I was wondering if it would be advisable/strategic to use an iPad (Pro) as my main device at HC? I will be bringing a laptop as well but it can be slow sometimes (4GB RAM &amp;  Intel Core i5 Processor vs the college's suggested 8GB RAM), and I've been meaning to get an iPad anyway for digital note taking, art, and other things. Would anyone have any insights/advice on this? :)  \n\n\nNote: If it helps, I plan on studying Bio / Psych",

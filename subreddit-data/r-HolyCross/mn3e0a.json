I was wondering what the overall vibe of the College is, what the social scene is like (especially for freshman considering no Greek life), what the people are like, etc....",

I know folks who stayed on campus most of the time and love it, and people who were out exploring New England.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll make amazing, life-long friends, and have a fantastic four years!  Good luck!",

I graduated from Holy Cross in 2018 and I absolutely loved my time at Holy Cross and I will forever cherish the friendships I made and the memories I made with them! They're the type of bonds that'll last our entire lives. The people there are incredible, and everyone is so intelligent and really likes school and is there to learn and get a strong education.\n\nOne thing I liked about campus, was since it was so small I would always run into multiple people that I knew walking anywhere, and I could always find someone I knew to sit with in Kimball, or study with in the library.\n\nThere's a great social scene at Holy Cross! There is always something going on during the weekend, and since all the off campus apartments are within 5 minutes walking of the campus, it's really easy and also safe to go off campus to multiple parties a night! Additionally, the college does a really good job of providing other weekend activities and they constantly used to bring food trucks to campus!\n\nAdditionally, I always loved the tailgates for the football games in the fall! Since Holy Cross has such a strong alumni community, there are at least three fields that always get filled up with people tailgating before most games! Additionally, Holy Cross has a strong family element to it, so you'll probably have friends with parents/family members who are alumni who will tailgate, so that can be a lot of fun!\n\nThere is no Greek Life, but since roughly 25% of the students are NCAA D1 Athletes, the sports teams often fill the spot that Greek life would! All the freshman dorms are in a row on campus, so all the freshman live near each other which helps to build a strong sense of community.\n\nI truly cannot say enough positive things about Holy Cross, I loved my time there so much. I'm also lucky enough to get to share Holy Cross with my little sister, who is Class of 2023, and my boyfriend. I'm currently enrolled at an Ivy League for graduate school, and the support that I received at Holy Cross was leaps and bounds more than what I am receiving at my school now.\n\nI could go on forever about Holy Cross! Feel free to DM if you want to chat more!",

This could have changed since I graduated, and since Covid-19 has happened but this is how it used it to be! In my experience, most underclassmen didn't go to bars on the week nights, it was usually just juniors and seniors, and I never went to a bar until after I was 21, so it's not like you'd need a fake as a freshmen. \n\nSince Holy Cross is a small school, it's easier to find out about off campus parties, and I was never really asked if I knew anyone at the party I was going to, nor was I ever asked to pay an entrance fee, since I know that sometimes happens at larger schools. I didn't find that the social scene was exclusive, or that you had to be a certain friend group to take part in it. Since Holy Cross is such a small school, you'll always see people you know out at parties, and most upperclassmen want to include the freshmen! \n\nThere are some parties in the senior and junior dorms, but the RA's are pretty strict when it comes to parties in the underclassmen dorms, so we would only pregame there! There are also some yearly themed darties during the fall and spring that are pretty popular and I always had a lot of fun at them!",

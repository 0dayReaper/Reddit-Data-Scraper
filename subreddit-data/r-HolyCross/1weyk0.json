I would always show them funny or cool stuff so they decided to check it out for themselves, and obviously there was no going back after that. I believe they all sub here, but only myself and my roommate have posted/commented here from our group. \n\nI think it would be great if we promoted this sub and got a lot of poeple to post/comment, but I think getting people into reddit is more complicated than just putting up a sign that says \"Hey, check this out!\". I think people would be more likely to do so if people that are frequently around them were on reddit a lot. But that's just my two cents. Let me know if you want some help trying to spread the word or anything like that. ",

And we all know the idea and concept of reddit is a hard one to grasp from explainations rather than just experiencing it yourself. Perhaps we need to find a way to get redditors from other subreddits to recognize r/holycross so that if they are an alumni or something they would know to come here and help improve the sub. I just like making posts to the reddit because it lacks activity with so many few members.",

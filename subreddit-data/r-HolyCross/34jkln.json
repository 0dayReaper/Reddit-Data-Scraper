    "postText": "The fishbowl discussion and talks that have been going on around campus recently and tension between certain Holy Cross groups have led to some heated discussion, debates, and arguments. Where do you stand on this situation and what are your opinions on it? What do you think our campus is doing to help facilitate the discussion?

    "postText": "Hi all :) \n\nNative South Floridian here and rising sophomore who currently attends school instate. \n\nWhile I am not unhappy and haven\u2019t had an unpleasant experience or anything of that sort, I was accepted to HC during the 2022-2023 school year, but declined due to financial reasons. Going to school instate made more sense money wise, so I did that. \n\nEver since then, I have lived with some regret about the decision due to a couple of factors. Firstly, I felt like it was my chance to see something new. Florida has kinda become a little whack, and I\u2019d like to live somewhere else. College is a good transition to do so. I have a lot of family up in the NE, and I fell in love with it. Secondly, I love the smaller size/liberal arts aspect. \n\nNow, I am faced with a decision to apply to transfer as this will be my last year of eligibility to apply as a third year for Fall 2024. \n\nI was just wondering how you guys felt about the culture, people, area, etc. for new students or transfers in general. \n\nI would have to figure out the money thing if I decide to, but I figure I would have an option to either accept or decline the transfer if I am accepted and sort all of that out. \n\nAlso, I presume since there is a low student population, the majority lives on campus? \n\nHope your summer semester or break is going well! :)",

            "comment": "I graduated nearly 10 years ago now. I can't comment on my opinion from a transfer/new student POV, but I really loved the campus, the buildings, the overall spirit. Academics were difficult and the education was expensive, but overall I don't regret going there. I'm proud to say I went to HC and I made awesome friends!\n\nIn terms of the people and culture, I would say over half came from prep or private school backgrounds and majority white, but I think diversity has increased since then. Not sure if that matters to you. I am both non-white and came from public school, but the lack of diversity didn't bother me at the time. The students were overall nice. Somewhat clique-y, but mostly friendly. Times may have changed with GenZ - maybe in a more positive direction.\n\nThe campus itself felt like a bubble because Worcester is a little rough on the edges, but overall I liked the environment. \n\nTo answer your question, yes, majority lived on campus. I lived there all 4 years!",

            "comment": "Rising junior here! Honestly, I haven't met a person who has transferred to this college. I've heard of people who took gap years for sure but no transfer students, so I can't comment about the transfer culture because I haven't seen it at all. However, I'm gonna be completely honest and talk only using MY OWN experiences here: this college gets really cliquey.\n\nBecause the student population is really small, I made friends by meeting the majority of my more general, friendly \"friends\" during freshman year and finding my close friend group during sophomore year. Thus, as a rising junior, I foresee my current friend group being pretty set in stone, and I can see it being the same case with others. Therefore, if you do decide to transfer here as a rising junior, be prepared to see a LOT of cliques. HOWEVER, don't be too deterred from this because the people here are extremely friendly and welcoming.\n\nEchoing and expanding on what /u/JuniperRose7 said, there is quite a lack of diversity here (and the college's social media accounts try to make it seem like it's very diverse here, but it's not), the campus does feel like a bubble, and the majority does live on campus. Holy Cross is, despite everything I've said, a really enjoyable place to be in. You meet some really awesome people here, and you feel as though you can take risks and it'll be okay. I hope that helps and feel free to ask me any questions!",

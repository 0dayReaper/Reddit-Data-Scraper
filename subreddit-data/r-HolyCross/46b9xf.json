    "postText": "Heyo, I'm a junior looking at schools. Since my dad almost went to HC, it's on my list. I'm actually at the school now, visiting after a tour. So, how easy would it be to start a heavier band? Like obviously the Palladium is nearby, but is there a lot of interest and music and all the good punk stuff? Also, how is the environmental science program? Is the major worth doing at the school? Lastly, one thing I liked is how happy everyone seems. Are you happy being a sader?\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this. ",

            "comment": "It's hard to say about the band, it'll really be about who you meet. You can always  post in the accepted students Facebook page when and if the time comes to gauge interest. Also I don't know a lot about the environmental science program, but it seems like those in the program enjoy it - not sure how prestigious/competitive it may be but that's up to you to figure out (you can find out more on an open house visit). While you're here, maybe go to the environmental science department and find a professor to talk to. As for happiness, that's definitely one of the perks of going to HC because everyone is pretty happy. It's actually pretty impressive considering the stress most people are under because it's definitely not an easy school, but everyone's always happy and friendly. Feel free to ask any more questions since I wasn't much help with your other ones...",

            "comment": "the band item really depends. i knew a few kids who could really shred on the guitar but what their music interests are will be very mixed.\n\nmuch like simon i can't speak to the environmental science program, but in my time there everything in the science depts were highly respected. definitely talk to a professor\n\nthe people are very happy and polite at hc. you'll be 50 feet from a door and they'll hold it for you. at first you'll think they're crazy but in no time you'll find yourself doing the same thing haha. hc is a smaller school so you end up knowing more of the population and as a result of that everyone is really friendly with each other.",

I would say Palladium is more of the 'big show' if you're just starting a band, but that being said my buddy was able to get a surprising amount of gigs playing live at local bars and for college parties around worcester (HC, WPI, etc.).  Plus, definitely a good city for heavy stuff.",

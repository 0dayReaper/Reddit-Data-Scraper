It'll prompt you to enter your school email to gain access.\n\nStudent Hubs put all student servers in one place for everyone to see!\n\nIf you own a Discord server and you want the student body to know about it, you can add it to the hub and it will be visible to everyone! Our server just reached 150 members today after getting 14 new students in 3 days through the Hub!\n\nServers can be tagged as Club, Classes &amp; Subjects, Social &amp; Study, and Misc., so whether your Discord server represents a student organization, an academic interest, or just a hangout group, there's room for everyone in the Student Hub!  \n\n\n[https://discord.gg/YFfkUhxNHM](https://discord.gg/YFfkUhxNHM)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8s57f9qurcl71.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3cde99d5f0afcad66ab98012686467c4e76118ba",

We have a few servers run by students and faculty, so check em out below:\n\n  \n**Holy Cross Student Server:** This is a pretty casual server for students to chat, game and talk about school stuffs.  \n[https://discord.gg/ysxdEvx](https://discord.gg/ysxdEvx)\n\n**Gaming &amp; Esports Club Server:** This is a server run by the school's gaming club. If you play video games casually or competitively, this might be the server for you!  \n[https://discord.gg/CCG4nZk](https://discord.gg/CCG4nZk)\n\n**Math/Comp. Sci./Stats Server:** This server is run by the college's Comp. Sci. department and is used by Math/CS/Stats students and professors. It's a great resource for current or prospective majors/minors!  \n[https://discord.com/invite/HEBWspB](https://discord.com/invite/HEBWspB)\n\nEvery server here is open to current/incoming students and alumni, with some guest policies if you're not a current or prospective HC student, so even if you're still in the college admissions process, feel free to join any server and ask questions about our school!",

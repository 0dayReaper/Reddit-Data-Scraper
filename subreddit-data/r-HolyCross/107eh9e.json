I think if you want to go into econ or finance that's a pretty solid plan. If you want to go into tech I would avoid at all costs given how small the HC comp sci department is and how little the program actually prepares you for the real world.",

            "comment": "Graduated 2009 with a minor in cs, so things prob have changed/grown. Major was physics. Cs is lumped in with the math department it seems, but u can still major or minor in it. CS was a small department, most of my classes had the same 5 people in it in the major/minor track. So very good stu/prof ratio. \n\nI had the most dedicated associate prof there who would just not let me fail. It was unacceptable. He is somewhere else now. He was in his office many nights until midnight.\n\nEmail or call laurie smith king with any specifics. She is the department lead and a very good and caring prof. I graduated into a recession, never ended up using my cs minor professionally but it was nice to practice the skills and teach myself how to learn any sort of technical something. Good luck.",

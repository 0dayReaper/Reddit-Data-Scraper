    "postText": "Honestly it is so insane that I went to an institution that educated both Fauci and Thomas. With Clarence Thomas going after contraceptives, same-sex relationships and marriage next after the Supreme Court just overturned Roe vs. Wade after 50 years of precedent, I am so ashamed to be a part of the same college he went to. \n\nAlumni should stop making contributions and I hope the student body will protest to rid his name and pictures off the school. While they're at it, HC should rescind his honorary degree and stop using his name as selling point to prospective students to go to the school, it's disgusting.",

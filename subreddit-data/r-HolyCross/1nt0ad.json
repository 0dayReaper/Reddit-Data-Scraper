    "postText": "For those of us who go here, what's your opinion on Montserrat (What Montserrat did you have and what was it like, what cluster)? \n\nI pretty much disliked my Montserrat because high expectations, a lot of iffy grading I didn't find to be fair and it did not allow me to rule out two of my common requirements that I was going to have to take anyway. I still have a bunch of Common Reqs. to complete and my Montserrat only covered for social science which is already a part of my major.  \n\nSo anyways, what do you think of Montserrat, yay or nay?

            "comment": "Personally, I loved my Montserrat class, but found the program as a whole to be kind of pointless. I guess I had a good experience because I had a great professor, but I chose a math class because that sounded cool, not knowing I would be a math major at the time. The class took up space I could've used for other prereqs. Anyway, I didn't have the whole finding myself experience they want to get out of us so there's that. ",

I felt like it actually worked, and the whole program is actually pretty great, although I've heard some really awful opinions from people who got shafted with professors that weren't into it or classes that just weren't very conducive to being good Montserrat classes.

            "comment": "I'm older, so I did the *voluntary* First Year Program (FYP) before Monterssat ever existed. I liked it, did the science flavor courses before i decided on a physics major. My courses didn't contribute to my major or any other common reqs, but one of the two courses for FYP was my second favorite, second most memorable class, now that i look back at my time there. (It was a computation-lite physics of meteorology course, with some theology/philosophy mixed in, of course. Best grade at HC. My favorite, most memorable course was a classics/history course called Ancient science--basically how the ancient scientists discovered science truths of the world. Worst grade at HC.) Anyway, my prof was the head/founder of the FYP program (Garvey) and a physics prof, and he loved being able to wax philosophical and lay off the numbers for those classes. I'm really glad i took that course, but the FYP courses and general lifestyle reeked of a sense of *coddling* that i find too prevalent in college culture today.",

                            "comment": "&gt;HC has one of the best financial aid policies of any school in the US. In fact, it's one of the few schools left that still has a need-blind admissions policy (hc doesn't look at a students financial need/ability before deciding whether or not to accept them). It also has a 100% need met policy which means that in some way, your package will meet your needs though grants, loans, scholarships, etc. HC entirely uses the FAFSA and CSS/Profile to determine need, so your family's financial situation drives what HC gives you based on that data you provide on those forms.\n\n\nThis isn't completely true or I have something misunderstood through my  FA package. FAFSA says with my mom being the only one paying for my education and my sister's who attends Tufts, should contribute 10k a year, the package I get from HC is having our family pay 25k a year+ not even including the loans in the package. My parents are divorced and doesn't even consider the fact that my mom works overtime constantly to help pay our college tuition and I know for a fact that FA has emailed me saying that they don't consider my mom's overtime but only look at her income when determining our package. Through other schools it may look fine and dandy and seem like the best, but they heavily gloss over many things about the FA system. HC didn't meet 100% of my needs, and from recent showings they haven't been advertising the 100% needs since I was a freshman. \n\nI'm not bashing you or anything, I just wanted to know a more direct answer if you were in the FA office, maybe I have somethings wrong, but I just thought I'd comment on what it actually is like, but regardless thanks for the AMA!",

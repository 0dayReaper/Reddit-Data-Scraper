I'm not sure for what classes you should take, but my suggestion for Montserrat is to take one that will take care and cover a common area requirement that you aren't thinking about majoring in, in your case of interest in Economics, political science and physics, I'd recommend a Montserrat that fulfills a philosphy, art, music, or cross cultural requirement. That's what i wished I knew my first year.\n\nTo take advatage of; you should kind of have an idea starting freshman year, confirming sophomore year, if you want to study abroad, that's a great program. If you look at concentrations we have plenty to look at that might interest you if you're thinking about that. As for what to bring I'll update that later, but you should definitely bring shower slippers because those will be very useful. \nI'm not sure about club basketball or if it's a thing, I know an intermural league exists. \n\nI'm excited to see you in the fall!",

I'm going to be a freshman next year deciding between economics and political science as a major, and I obviously know about the academic rigor and quality of the school.  My only question is about the social life. What are the parties like? Is the school really as strict on alcohol as I've heard? Will it be hard to get into parties as a freshman guy? Is most of the social life on or off campus?",

If you're looking for a party as an underclassmen usually the sports team is the place to go, and most of them are off campus i believe. However most of the majority parties are on campus around the upperclasmen housing but freshmen and sophomores will host their own parties anyways. Regardless I\"m sure you'll find a party you want so you don't have to worry too much about that. Most of our social life is on campus",

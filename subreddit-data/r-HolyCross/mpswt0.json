            "comment": "I can't attest to it personally (accounting major) but I know a bunch of people who went through the program and went to really good med schools and are doctors now.\n\nThere is no grade inflation at HC lol. It is very competitive and you're going to have to work hard if you want to be at the top of your class. There are very few easy a courses to be found. But all that being said... Is it hard to get a good GPA? I guess it depends on what your idea of good is. A 3.0-3.5? Shouldnt be unreasonable if you put in the work. Still plenty of time to socialize. A 3.5-3.75? You're going to have to work very hard for that and you still won't be close to tops in the class. Over a 3.75? You'll need to be in the top 3% of the entire class to achieve this.",

            "comment": "Grade inflation?? More like grade deflation. It is very competitive at HC. It wasn't easy for me to get good grades, but I survived. I graduated in 2015. I was in the health professionals program at the time, and I did choose the school based on the premed program reputation too. I'm in dental school now, but I had to take extra courses after I graduated in order to raise my undegrad GPA since my GPA upon graduation wasn't good enough. Looking back, I wish I had gone to my state school to save money and I know I would've gotten mostly A's outside of HC considering the schools I went to after HC I got all A's so ... I wouldn't have had to take 2-3 gap years, but oh well. You live and you learn. I learned a lot at HC, made great friends, and had great experiences. It's totally doable to get good grades, but just make sure you put in a lot of work.",

It is very competitive.  \n\n\nThe pre-med curriculum is rigorous but the advisors do a good job of guiding you through it. Lots of classes are needed. And the committee will help you prepare for application to medical school or any health professions program while you are at HC or at any point in the future as an alum. (Most folks do not go directly to medical school straight from undergrad.)  \n\n\nI went through the program and even though I decided not to go to medical school I frequently worked with the advisors after graduation. They were helpful. They will also be brutally honest in rating you as a candidate. The process of applying is very long, challenging, and expensive. They will only recommend you apply when they think you are ready.  \n\n\nThere are a lot of research opportunities. I majored in the sciences and the departments are welcoming. (Also, for example, you don't need to be a chem major to do chem research, but be prepared to talk about why you want to do it and what kind of research you enjoy, why do you want to work in their specific lab, etc.) And yes, there are many volunteer opportunities throughout the College.  \n\n\nThe website has a ton of useful information, definitely recommend spending time to click around and read:   \n[https://www.holycross.edu/academics/programs/health-professions-advising/academic-preparation](https://www.holycross.edu/academics/programs/health-professions-advising/academic-preparation)  \n\n\nHappy to talk with you more about my experience if you'd like. And our other moderator u/freedan12 is a buddy of mine who was bio/premed and could probably add more thoughts here.",

            "comment": "Pre-med program is pretty good but you have to REALLY work for it. HC is known to have lower GPAs than other schools which can hurt you if you do not succeed in the sciences. If you got into better schools with grade inflation I'd go there instead. Advising can be hit or miss as it will depend on your advisor. People who are pursuing medicine will get in and HC will work with you to achieve that but they will set very high and (potentially) unrealistic goals for you to achieve, if you want to succeed at HC you need to be on top of all your assignments and I'd even start learning ahead of classes to really succeed. \n\nOn a side note, HC is only known in the east coast amongst east coast natives, if you want to anywhere outside of New England and the east coast metropolitan cities after college, go to a better well known school with easier attainable grades.",

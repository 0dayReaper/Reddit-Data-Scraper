I\u2019m premed and I just did research all summer in the chemistry department. There\u2019s tons of chem and bio labs that students can get involved in for as much or as little commitment as they like. Pre-med advising has been good for me so far. I\u2019m applying next cycle so I\u2019ll have more contact with them this year. I agree with the other commenter about the matriculation rate. PM me if you have any more questions!",

The administration sucks (as it does at any university) do you need to be on top of your own shit, don't expect them to tell you correct and/or timely information. \n\nAll of my professors with only 2 exceptions were amazing. (One OK prof was a grad student, the other was clueless and I dropped his course the first week) I was a B.S. pure math major FWIW.",

Once you get past the charm and appearance of the campus, it's like any other school, so therefore, it can get dull. And it has all of the problems of CUNY, for sure!",

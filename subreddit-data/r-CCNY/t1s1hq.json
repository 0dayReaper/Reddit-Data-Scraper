    "postText": "Hi, I'm a freshman in civil engineering in ccny. I'm writing this post as a heads up to every student coming in or currently in the grove school. Stay on top of your requirements and prerequisites. Do not depend on advising to tell you which classes to take because they might mess you up and cause a delay in graduation. My advisor suggested to not take two science courses in the same semester. But I realized that this will cause future semesters to be absolutely overloaded.",

You will have one class you can't get into at least one semester that will cause a delay, or you will fail one class that will delay you a semester. Get used to it. Instead of doing 6 classes, during spring-summer you can offload one of the classes to the summer. Summer courses are nice and fast, and easy to concentrate on since you're doing 1-2 classes. I remember my Physics II class was actually taught by an NYU professor during the summer.",

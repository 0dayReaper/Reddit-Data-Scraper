    "postText": "City College of New York (CUNY) CS vs Rensselaer\nPolytechnic Institute CS\nBasically both schools are super different and I would form at both. I live in Long Island so at cny I would be able to come home every weekend since it's only an hour away but RPI is a 3 hour drive. I keep hearing like bad things about rpi but I'm wondering if even with these bad things is it better than ccny? RPI is ranked way higher and it's private.\nAlso I'm planning to transfer after a year: I'm wondering if rpi being ranked higher would make it easier to transfer to higher ranked schools like\nBarnard/NYU rather than if I was transferring from ccny. But then another consideration is that what if the adjustment to rpi and it being a harder school makes my grades suffer and that will kill my odds when transferring. Also I wanted to go to a school with like a sense of community and a pretty social school so I think RPI would be better for that since it's not a commuter school but l'm really unsure tbh. Pls gimme y'all's thoughts!!!",

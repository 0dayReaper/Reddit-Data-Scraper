It may be the best CUNY, but it is really old school as far as their curriculum.  Look at MIT's program (or any top 10 CS school) and compare and you will quickly see CCNY requires classes that are not really relevant to CS, but they do it because they always did.\n\nAlso, I recommend you take as many math classes at other schools and transfer them in. The math program is horrendous.  The instructors are very bad, VERY BAD.  For example in my Calc 2 class, out of 50 students, 6 passed.  I had a B going into the final and got a 20%.  Why?  Because they give no partial credit and you are not allowed a formula sheet - almost all college calc 2 classes allow this.  Most people in my class were on their second round at taking the class and most failed again.   You will see for many of the math classes you register for, they will not tell you who the math professor is until 2 days before class.  Why?  because almost all of them are horrible and no one would ever take their classes if they knew who was teaching them.   \n\nI have had 2 comp science classes so far and they are decent.   The other thing is the freshman advisor for CS is horrible.  Really bad!  She is there for one reason, to weed out as many students as possible from the program.  She actually tries and makes it harder for students rather than provide them the help they need.  I have a 3.5, but will be transferring to another school for the fall that has a more progressive CS program.   \n\nHope that helps...",

            "comment": "Because it is accredited and very rigorous and difficult. I have no idea what the other person is talking about it being outdated. Maybe because of what's taught? Like some class using old PICs to program? It doesn't matter, it's the concepts that matter behind it. Comparing MIT to CCNY isn't the best comparison.\n\nTrust me when I say very rigorous and difficult. I've had friends go to the other Comp Sci programs. CSI, City Tech, etc. What a joke of classes they had, a hard project in these places is a terminal that spits out different prompts depending on inputs. They couldn't believe the work I had in my classes. I've had other classmates transfer in from these other CUNYs and were stunned by the giant difference in the difficulty, amount of work, etc.",

It is very hard, but hard does not mean it is relevant and good.  Even look at Penn State or NYU's.  Both much higher ranked and better job placement, and the curriculum is very different.",

Being hard usually means you have to put more effort in, study a lot, learn to study efficiently, learn more concepts and do more research, take the work more serious, etc.\n\nI can't comment on the 3 science classes, the 3 calculus classes I think are fine to me, but I've heard about the calculus thing compared to other places. The data science classes are there I'm sure as electives. \"But they're electives\", the school doesn't usually have other electives available, so you're forced to take the data science ones either way.\n\nI've known students from places like NYU that have come here for their second bachelors. They said it was the same material and difficulty, just lack of resources since the university doesn't have the absorbents amount of money. As for job placements, most of the people in my classes had jobs lined up for graduation or after, and are at big places, including FAANG. It is what you make of it.",

They do have one Data Science course, but they specifically tell CS majors not to take it as it will not count for anything.  For as popular as Data Science is, CCNY should have several courses in its curriculum.  I agree about the ability to land a job, but honestly anyone with a CS degree and average grades should easily get a job out of school.  I have to assume the amount of students who land FAANG jobs out of CCNY is low, but I do not know for sure.  I have heard that CCNY is the DMV of college education and from an administration point of view they are right.  Some great professors that really care, but some that miss the mark.  The math department in general is in need of getting new professors who want to find ways teach kids effectively.  When you start to compare the curriculum of top 50 CS colleges in the US to CCNY's program, you can see where it breaks down.  For the price in state, it is great.  If you are out of state, look elsewhere.",

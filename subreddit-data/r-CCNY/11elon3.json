So far, I like the class. It's a lot of busy work imo, but it is doable with good time management. Some of the labs are also in different areas of nyc, which is kinda cool.  Tutoring seems to be very accessible, but I can't speak on its quality since I've never felt the need to use it. \n\nCcny is a good school, and I really like being here. Nyc is a cool place. The school does have some downsides, but they don't bother me much. I'll list some out. Ccny is a commuter school, so it can be a little harder to make friends. Many of the buildings are old and need renovations. The Wingate gym is lacking imo. The nac building is terrible, but you are a bio major, so you won't be in there much. \n\nThe positives about ccny outweigh the negatives for me, but it might not be the same for you.",

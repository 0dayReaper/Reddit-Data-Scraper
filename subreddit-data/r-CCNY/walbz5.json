My advisor is almost always gone on vacation or busy so I\u2019ve been my own advisor for the past two year. I\u2019m on my last year so I\u2019ve done precovid and zoom classes both. I wish we had the option for more online classes. Hate the commute there too. \n\nBe aware of the wind up at the hills as the weather cools down.",

Sometimes if I take a different route, I have to hike uphill from st Nicholas park or Amsterdam ave. It\u2019s a workout there I tell ya. I stopped going to the libraries after I saw rats running around the tables, \u00a2um and pee stains on the couches, bedbugs wandering around couches and carpet (I\u2019ve complained to the staff there) and literal filth in the seating areas. We\u2019ve even had a raccoon invading the NAC library once and they closed down the place lol. But I can go on and on about the stairs and elevator situation. I\u2019ve also been using degreeworks and my own spreadsheet to cross check what I need to graduate, feels like such a scam.",

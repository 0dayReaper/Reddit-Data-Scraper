    "postText": "Hey guys my professor waited last minute and handed in grades around 9pm last night. On blackboard I have a 150/180 yet I was given a C+. According to her gradin schedule that is 2 letter grades lower than the grade I received. I handed in my final a few days late but even with that I received a 25/30. So if she wanted to deduct points she could have on my final. I\u2019m just trying to understand why my grade would be a C if blackboard shows a B grade.",

            "comment": "I'd recommend you contact your professor and advisor immediately (like today, even if it is a weekend, just for the paper trail).  If an error was made you want them to know before things are final in the system.  If you feel you've been slighted your advisor may be able to advocate for the grade you feel you deserve.\n\nHow was your class participation?  Absences? I know some professors include that as a consideration for grading, but they are usually explicitly up front about it in the syllabus, etc.",

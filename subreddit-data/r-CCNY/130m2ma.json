For those of you that go there, do you think it\u2019s that bad/dangerous or is it in a safe and nice area?",

Some of my classes end late at night (around 8pm) and even then I don't feel like I'm in imminent danger. if you need to, there's always shuttle buses that'll take you directly to the B,D,A,C train stations directly north and south of campus. Hope this helps and welcome to ccny!! \n\nthis is my first year and it wasn't bad :))",

I remember there was a gun scare once as there was a report of someone with a gun near the HS nearby (not the CCNY HS). \n\nBut outside the campus is different. You are recommended to NOT walk alone at night walking to the train station. Try to walk with other people. You don't even have to talk to them, just be near them. Then they have shuttle buses to the train stations anyways.",

Try to either walk with other folks or take the shuttle as you get used to the area, but also try to leave yourself time to check out other routes to class in the daylight, figure out which streets are quiet and which are populous.  \nLit path over dark one, populated path over desolate one, and awareness of alternate options if your usual bus or train has service issues, will all serve you well.",

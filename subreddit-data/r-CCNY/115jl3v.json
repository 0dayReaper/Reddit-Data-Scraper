    "postText": "I applied to Macaulay CCNY and so far I\u2019ve gotten in as a comp sci major. \n\nI\u2019m currently taking AB calculus. If I get a 4 on the exam, do I still need to take a math placement test? And if so, will my score on the math placement test still determine if I can move on to calc 2? \n\nAnd does getting into Macaulay have any significance in regards to the math placement test?",

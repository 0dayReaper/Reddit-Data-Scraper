    "postText": "So I'm going to apply for the fall 2023 as a freshman. It's been a while since I graduated high school so I don't have much to show in terms of supplemental material. I noticed that I can just go ahead and submit my application with absolutely 0 supplemental materials. I plan on adding at least something there but I was wondering how hard is to get accepted into CCNY without any supplemental material? I will be paying the full out-of-state tuition too, does that help my chances?",

The Senior Design Lab for EE was a bit underwhelming, but thankfully they had other lab rooms to use and the lab tech, was very helpful. Although there was one lab tech who was the ultimate weirdo and not cooperative. Not a big deal though. \n\nAnyways, the other engineering labs we visited for our senior these were awesome in comparison. They were even building some new facilities for some of them.\n\nOther than labs, you aren't really in the Grove building that much, most of the classes (for any major) is in the main building, the NAC.",

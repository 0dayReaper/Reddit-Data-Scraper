    "postText": "Hello everyone, I need some advice on scheduling as some classes I have registered have prerequisites and requirements. The classes are gen chem 1 and calc 1, they both require a c minimum in math 195. I got a D in math 195 which is passing but i already am registered for gen chem 1 and calc 1. All my other classes I received A\u2019s but unfortunately due to a bad professor I received a D in math 195. I am not sure if it is absolutely required to get keep taking 195 until I meet minimum requirements or I can just move along without having to take it again. I was advised to speak with my advisors and maybe convince them to allow me to take gen chem and 195 together in the fall if i do plan on taking it again. How do I go about this situation?",

I took the placement test and was put in college algebra/trig. At the end of the semester I was able to enroll in Calc 1 (thanks CUNYFirst). No one said anything to me, so I just showed up the first day. I had a great algebra instructor (he was also my Calc 1 instructor) and he gave me some stuff to study over the winter break. I got a 100 in both classes, so I\u2019m happy that I was  able to slip precalc, it would have been a waste of time and money for me",

I\u2019ve had a few teachers at CCNY that are adjunct lecturers at City but are tenure at other schools like Columbia.  I had one teacher last semester he\u2019s actually a high school teacher but teaches a few college  courses so I definitely think majority at least have other jobs cause they don\u2019t make a lot alone from being an adjunct at one school.",

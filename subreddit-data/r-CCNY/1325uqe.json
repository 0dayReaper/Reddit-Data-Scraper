    "postText": "Good afternoon all, I was planning on taking Math 190 (College Algebra/Trig) and Math 195 (Pre-calculus) in the summer, however my advisor keeps stressing the fact that the courses are \"very intense\" and \"fast-paced\", almost like she's trying to talk me out of it kind of. So I wanted to know if there were any other students who did what I am thinking of doing and explain to me what their experience was like before I make a decision. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny help is appreciated, thank you.",

( I ended both classes with a B) if you choose to do that then make sure you dedicate your time to studying because they move very quick. If your taking the 4 week like I did they fit 6 classes in 1 day and exams every week . And you can\u2019t drop once you start cause you already paid for it. If you need notes let me know",

If you take the classes you need to be prepared to dedicate a substantial amount of time to studying. When you take courses like math classes in the summer it\u2019s literally an entire regular semester crammed into 4 weeks, 6 weeks etc depending on how long the summer session is because there\u2019s different options. If your advisor is repeatedly telling you it\u2019s intense and fast paced they\u2019re trying to warn you to think carefully not really talk you out of it because it\u2019s your decision at the end of the day but if later on you fail and/or aren\u2019t satisfied with your grade hypothetically they can\u2019t be blamed. If you know you can\u2019t keep up with alot of material being covered in a short amount of time and studying alot during the week that plays a factor into whether you should take the class.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m currently working on the pre-req and because of the pandemic and online classes, i completely fell out of focus. i got a d for calc 1 and retook it to get a B+ and got an F for calc 2 and am currently retaking it for this sem and i think i\u2019ll get a good grade.\nmy science grade for chem1 and phys 1 are great. \nhowever, my advisor stated that grove looks at all math and science grades and it has to be a gpa of 2.5 or above. now i\u2019m not sure if i get lower that an A- for calc 2, i\u2019ll have a higher than 2.5 gpa for all math and science. \n\nsomeone from the grove department did state that i can take calc 3 and a science next sem to do better and higher my gpa but also said that it doesn\u2019t guarantee admission. \n\nshould i be worried about admission if i, (1). get above an A- for calc 2 or\n(2). higher my gpa with calc 3 and a science. \n\ni really want to study engineering and got so unlucky during the pandemic with online classes cause i couldn\u2019t adapt.",

You need to ensure to get an A in Calc 2, and then apply towards groove after taking and acing Calc 3. You also will need to take physics (if required for your intended major) and ace those courses as well.",

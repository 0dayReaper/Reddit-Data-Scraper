    "postText": "Hello, I am looking to go to CCNY for a CS degree. I hear that to initially enter the college it is really hard, comparable to stony brook?  I currently have a 3.6 gpa and couldn\u2019t take the sat. My regents are around the 80s for math and rest are 90s. Would you think it would be very likely for me to get in, or this school should just be a dream.",

    "postText": "Hello guys, \n\nI'm currently an EE undergrad student at Binghamton and have been considering doing my Master's in EE at CCNY because it's relatively cheap and I'd be saving a crap ton of money during those two years because I live in NYC. \n\nCan anyone who's in the program/ who has knowledge about it just talk a little bit about their thoughts on the program? Anything ranging from whether you thought pursuing the degree here was worth the time and money, all the way to how the degree has helped you in the job market or in your career path would be greatly appreciated. Are there any concentrations that stand out more than others? Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "if industry: no. just no. Any Engineering Masters here is complete a complete fucking joke, cringe-worthy even, unless you're going for a unionized job (ConEd, MTA, etc). But at that point your angle of attack is wrong. Go into the union first, get the unionized education benefit, then go to school while your education is paid off another man's dime. Since budget is your concern, shoot for NYU now. \n\nIf for theory/PhD: First and foremost, congratulations if you've decided on going for your PhD. CCNY's MSPhD engineering programs are a wonderful step in the right direction. The lab experience is plentiful and more importantly research-networking at CCNY is parallel to none. They let you get involved with multiple labs that may not even be in your research interests, just to help you learn more things. The stuff I've seen with the ChE Ph.D department here in the CDI trumps that of getting a Ph.D elsewhere, definitely a memorable experience.  \n\n\nTl;dr: MS only? no. MSPhD? yes.\n\n\nEdit: Exception - MechE Masters at CCNY. They're OKAY with Almuni to industry networking. Not good. Just okay.",

            "comment": "Totally agree with IEatTheEntireAd. Doesn't Bing have a 4+1?? Do that instead of going to CCNY. My advice is the stay at bing and instead of studying a Masters in EE study Masters at Bing for Systems Engr. Trust me, thank me later. If you want to stay in the city and affordability look in Cooper Union. Also Masters typically take 2 years, but dont expect it to take you 2 years if you go to City. City is know to not put enough seats into sections. Assume if you go to City it will take you 3 years. ",

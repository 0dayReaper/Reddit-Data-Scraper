Thats what a thought you are here to trash them and troll the thread for what you have no life or what? If you read the title they are asking for actual customers who have used them or heard about them. I have never used Kita books that actaully looks like a scam site or a sketchy site but i have personally used digit textbook and bought several textbooks through them and had no issues whatsoever. your a joke!",

Are you bashing the site for no obvious reason? I have bought from a ton of these cheapo textbook sites in the past 3 years of school and honestly have not have to do a fbi background check on any of them I have simply asked my classmates where they bought there book online cheap from and they give me a site they used and have never been ripped off or had any issues so far. I have saved thousands of dollars though versus buying at the bookstore or paying these outrageous prices from online retailers. I used Digit textbook last month and found 2 of my course textbooks for at least 100 dollars cheaper from any other site and had no issues, downloaded right away after checkout just like the other few sites i found prior through my friends. My friend lives in the NY area and confirmed that building is not empty that is an office WeWork building with several companies working out of it so sorry pal but you are the one that sounds sketchy to me not the site.",

You are another website/competitor trying to give negative feedback against them. I say this because I myself have purchased over 5 textbooks for various courses from them and have had no issue whatsoever with them downloads/copies/etc. And also they were trying to assist you and you went and posted bad reviews when they were trying to help you? Sorry but you seem like a complete j\\*\\*ka\\*\\* and I would have done the same thing. I have recommended my classmates who have also used them and have had no problems with their downloads either. And have have emailed and received assistance from support regarding one of my textbooks as well and they were nothing but helpful and courteous the entire way.

Or are you just a troll or a another website trying to bash them for your own gain or working for another website? I have no idea about Kitabooks i have never used them nor do i say anything about Kitabooks but i personally have purchased several textbooks from digittextbook, my friends have used them and others in my classes, Do you need me to provide my invoices from them along with my birth certificate as well for you to make you feel better? lmao. you trolls make me laugh",

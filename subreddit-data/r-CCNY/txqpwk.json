    "postText": "I\u2019m a freshmen trying to get into Grove for Mechanical Engineering, but I have to complete prerequisite first: calc 2, physics 1. I did horribly on calc 2 my first semester so I had to drop it, but then I found out that you can\u2019t take physics without calc 2. \n\nSo, I decided to retake calc 2 in this semester, but this time with chemistry 1, because apparently that\u2019s a class that I need for mechanical engineering, according to the adviser. Chemistry actually isn\u2019t that bad, the problem is my writing for engineering teacher. I can\u2019t focus on calc 2 at all, so I might have to drop it again! I just feel like I\u2019m wasting time and not actually doing anything towards my degree. Is that true?\n\nThe classes I\u2019ve passed so far are the 2 FIQWS English classes, I\u2019m going to pass writing for engineering easily, and I have a bunch of credits that transferred over from classes that I took at Brooklyn college in high school (but I\u2019m not sure how many of those count towards mechanical engineering). \n\nWill I be able to graduate on time, or will I get left behind?",

Taking it this semester, and even if I pass and everything goes well. It will still take 2 more semester to even be able to apply into grove. And that\u2019s if everything goes as planned.",

    "postText": "i'm an out of state student (from Maryland) and i wanted to go to New York for college so i chose CUNY, so i know that my tuition rate would be higher than someone who is from the city, so i kinda sorta realize what i was getting myself into but i was just wondering if anyone was in the same situation and/or could help.\n\ni'm a first year student at CCNY, and because of my out of state status, i owed nearly $10k but after my financial aid, i still owe seven grand. just for fall semester.\n\nso i'm in the shit. this semester is ending soon and i'm stressing out what i should do so i can continue my enrollment. so far, my only choice is to throw myself into quite some debt just so i can figure out what to do next (and yes i know, i should have just done something in state)\n\nbecause first year loans do not cover everything, the question i should just ask at this point is what is the least scummy private student loans provider? i got my fed loans via Granite State so just fucking pray for me.\n\nanother question, if i plan on living in New York after graduation, would it be worth it to keep attending a CUNY or should i just do something in-state for now.\n\nthanks.\n\n**EDIT: so i'm swallowing my pride and i have decided to attend an in state school for the next semester or for the coming academic year. i should have done more research before doing this**",

It\u2019s basically the same as private loans without the ridiculous interest rates. Also, you should ask your primary academic advisor to put you in contact with a financial aid advisor! My advisor did that and she answered all my questions. \n\nTo your second question, if you want to live in New York after graduating, stay in New York. It\u2019s easier to get a job here if you know people here and attending college here provides the opportunity to make connections here!",

    "postText": "hey guys. i applied to CCNY later than usual and as result, my FAFSA was filed and processed *(processed on 25 July)* so i expected something to maybe not go right, but nothing like this. \n\nso, the amount i owe wasn't available to me to view in CUNYFirst until today when it finally updated, i was like okay sure, but when i jump into **\"View Financial Aid\"** or **\"Accept/Decline Awards\"** on CUNYFirst, it says $0.00 indicating that no awards have been offered. \n\nI don't know what to do because I don't want to risk having my classes dropped and waiting for spring semester to start. also, on my CUNYFirst to-do list, it doesn't say anything about financial aid so i don't know if they're missing any required forms or whatever.\n\nI've seen other people on Discord and on several subreddits with the same, or similar issue. do any of you guys know what to do or should i just wait it out and **try** my absolute hardest to contact CCNY finaid office",

Someone help \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\n\nLeaning more towards here bc city looks like they have better music facilities and equipment but I want to make sure I\u2019m making the best decision.",

            "comment": "I graduated from the sonic arts program and loved it--several of my classmates are now teaching in the program, several have jobs at studios or are working musicians, some are now doing audio in a commercial setting (I work at at a cable news studio) and some are doing things completely unrelated to audio but I don't think any of them regret  the program. They're very selective with admissions--my class had 16 students out of thousands of applications--so if you get in, do it! Even if you don't end up working in audio, so many of my musician friends talk about how they wish DAWs were taught as an instrument in college, and that's exactly what SAC is. Good luck!",

Brooklyn college doesn\u2019t seem to have that kind of level of equipment and facilities catered to their music tech undergrad program. But wow I didn\u2019t know they were that selective, I feel much more grateful. I think CC might be my choice! Thanks again!",

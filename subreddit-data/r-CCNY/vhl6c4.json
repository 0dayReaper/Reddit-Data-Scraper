    "postText": "Hi there, I am an incoming student, going to City College of New York for graduate school. I previously went there for undergraduate school and wanted to be more informed and happy about my selection. I know previously, City College was billed as the poor man's Harvard, and was universally the first free intuition of higher learning, as well as one-of-many historically black and college universities. \n\nWhat else have you heard about City College? How does it compare to other colleges/universities now? \n\nSince I'll be enrolled here for the next two years, I'm looking to use what you say in every day normal conversation. I know going to CUNY can be blah, but I've always saw City College as the shining star on the hill. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!",

Some of the best teachers I've ever had, but also a couple of stinkers (which I suppose should be expected).  I really feel like everyone here wants me to succeed.  Go Beavers!",

Staff was supportive, research was interesting, and the education is amazing. \n\nMaybe it depends on the program too. But I haven\u2019t really heard negative things from anyone. What program are you pursing?",

    "postText": "I  dropped three different classes with a W grade in three semesters. One  drop per sesmter. Will I be placed under academic warning for this? I  promised myself to do better this semester, but unfortunately, my dad  kicked me out of the house after we fought, so Im basically homeless for now and had to drop a class to ease the workload. For more reference, I  study at CCNY, Grove School.",

Pretty sure I've dropped more than 3, but idk if I did it consecutively.Should probably double check with the registar or something though.\n\n\nBtw, keep in mind you can only take a class 3 times, and I think that includes Ws. So, for example, if you drop a class that's required for your major 3 times (with a W or whatever), then you wont be able to get that degree. Again though, double check.",

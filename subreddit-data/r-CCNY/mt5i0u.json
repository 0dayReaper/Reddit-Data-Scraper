    "postText": "Hey guys I am a prospective student here, I applied to the biomedical science Sophie Davis program, which I didn't get into so they put me into the undeclared science. However, I am set on doing biomedical engineering and although I tried to apply to it on a website that said it requires a supplemental application, the website didn't work, so I emailed the office of admissions, and they said it wasn't working and they would work on it. I tried almost every day and it never worked. Long story short is it easy to transfer out of science into Grove? What can I do to accomplish this right away?  I emailed [engineering@ccny.cuny.edu](mailto:engineering@ccny.cuny.edu) 4 days ago, but I didn't receive any response, I emailed them again just now, so we will see if they say anything. And also are there any admitted students class of 2025 chats right now for this year? I want to get to know more people. Thank you so much for your help and I would request some help in my questions. Sorry to be a bother.",

My recommendation would be to go into the general admissions office by Marshak and engineering admissions office in the Steinman Hall, explain your situation and ask them what needs to be done from your side. Admin people are super slow to response via email or phone. You have to hunt them down! Good luck!!",

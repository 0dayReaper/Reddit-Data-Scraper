If you take 12 credits, versus 18, is that the same price?   \n\n\nDoes anyone know how tuition is calculated? Trying to graduate sooner.",

So if you take 9 credits, you would be paying like 9\\*365. At the end of the day, an average student should be taking 15 credits per semester because you need 120 credits to graduate.",

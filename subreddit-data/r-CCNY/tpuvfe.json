    "postText": "i want to go to a CUNY (i\u2019m from staten island) to study political science as an undergraduate for law school. everything i see written about CCNY sounds really positive\u2014 that it\u2019s the toughest CUNY, has ivy league professors, best pre law/poli sci program, skadden program, etc. sounds amazing. but on college factual, it ranks way way lower than other CUNYS like hunter, brooklyn, and graduate center in both overall and political science. is there a reason for that?",

            "comment": "Grad center isn't a fair comparison since it's a whole college that only does graduate degrees. I think the ranking are arbitrary when it comes to CCNY, Hunter, Brooklyn, and Baruch. CCNY is going to be better for science than Baruch, and Baruch is going to be better for business-aligned majors. Hunter might have the better \"overall\" ranking for whatever reason but if you're doing Computer Science it would be silly to pick Hunter over CCNY if you had the choice. They're all evenly matched and as rigorous having been to both Hunter and CCNY. Skadden is a big deal though and poli sci + the other Colin Powell School majors are well respected",

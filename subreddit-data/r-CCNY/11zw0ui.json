    "postText": "I'm here at CCNY and on this sub, and also on the general cohen library website (which is giving conflicting information) it states that the library is open 24/7 during midterms and finals. But when I look for the hours on the site, the latest it's open all semester is until 8. Do they just not have the extended hours on the website? How would I know what days the library is open late? \n\nOr is the 24/7 thing not in effect anymore since covid?",

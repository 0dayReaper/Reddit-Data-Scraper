    "postText": "Do cops give out tickets for alternate side around campus? Today I had to drive and I noticed a lot of cars parked on the side that has alternate side for today. It seems strange that so many people are willing to get tickets unless the cops in this neighborhood don't do that. (After alternate side was over I walked back to where I parked and didn't see a single ticket on anyone's windshield)",

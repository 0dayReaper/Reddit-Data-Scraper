    "postText": "  \n\nDear Dr. Boudreau, President, The City College of New York,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour recent letter, failing to condemn clear and ongoing human rights violations by the State of Israel, is saddening, frustrating, and, frankly, shameful. If you did not wish to involve yourself in the discussion, that would have been your prerogative. But, by demanding that the Division of Student Affairs remove their statement, you have effectively taken a position yourself, and given a position to the City College of New York. A position of silence in the face of evil.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou state, \u201cJewish students wonder if the number of CCNY students taking positions critical of Israel makes the campus less safe for them\u201d. But criticism of Israel is not criticism of Jews. Just as you, and many others at CCNY, have often criticized the United States government without criticizing the United States people, the same is being applied to Israel. If Jewish students feel unsafe, it is your job to expand the message of those condemning the slaughter of Palestinian children by the Israeli government, and to create more openness around their message; making it clear who is being condemned (that is, Israel\u2019s government, and not Jews). Of course, antisemitism will NEVER be tolerated. And even a hint of antisemitism by CCNY students or faculty should be approached with the harshest penalties possible. However, silencing voices crying out for justice is not the way to protect anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd you are silencing voices. You state, \u201cthe college will not\u2014indeed is constitutionally prohibited from\u2014censoring the speech of our student government or anyone on our campus,\u201d yet you simultaneously censor the voice of the Division of Student Affairs. Let us \u201ccall a fig a fig and a trough a trough\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou go on in your letter to write, \u201cI believe my mandate\u2014and what must be the focus of college effort in this matter\u2014is clear. It is not to assert the interests of one side over another, or to endorse the views of those who have done so\u2026\u201d. This is shocking and tone deaf. We are not talking about preferences or disputes about how the cafeteria should be run. We are not even talking about disagreements regarding economic policy or how to implement infrastructure changes. We are talking about the murder of innocent men, women, and CHILDREN. We are talking about a government firing rockets into a refugee camp. We are talking about a nation bombing hospitals! This isn\u2019t about \u201casserting the interests of one side over another,\u201d this is about condemning human rights violations! This is not two sides of an equal debate! Either you are for the murder of children or you are not. Full stop. And if you do not have the spine to speak out against such murder, at the very least, allow others (i.e. the Division of Student Affairs) to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour words: \u201cBut precisely because we are proud of our diversity, we must work to reconcile the tensions it may sometimes engender\u201d. You do not reconcile tensions by ignoring oppression. Truthfully, you sound like those moderates throughout history, during slavery, during the civil rights era, during the struggle for LGBTQ equality, who have privately, from the comfort of their dens, denounced the maltreatment of other human beings while publicly maintaining, \u201ceveryone should choose for themselves\u201d. John Stuart Mill once said, \u201cLet not any one pacify his conscience by the delusion that he can do no harm if he takes no part, and forms no opinion. Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing. He is not a good man who, without a protest, allows wrong to be committed in his name, and with the means which he helps to supply, because he will not trouble himself to use his mind on the subject\u201d. I will not go so far as Mills and say you are \u201cnot a good man,\u201d but maintaining neutrality, and forcing neutrality on City College, in the presence of clear wickedness, is not the boast you believe it to be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou proceed to write about the need for sustained dialogue. But sustained dialogue is not needed here. Sustained dialogue is necessary to resolve the root of the conflict. It is necessary to bring Israel and Palestine to peace. But it is not needed when a government kills kids. War crimes do not need our sustained dialogue, they need our condemnation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cFor now,\u201d you write, \u201cone thing must be clear. Our diversity means very little if we cannot figure out ways to understand one another, and to provide a climate on campus where people feel that they are safe and welcome\u201d. But how can we feel safe when the president of our university forces our college to take such a passive stance against the death of children? \u201cWe cannot police expression,\u201d you say, \u201cnor would we ever wish to,\u201d yet you did. And you are. \u201cBut we will unequivocally insure the safety of every member of our community\u201d. We are agreed only on this point of safety. All members of CCNY must feel safe. But failing to disparage human rights violations is not making anyone safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou close with these words: \u201c\\[We will\\] endeavor, despite the challenges, to build here a more nuanced understanding of complicated issues\u2026\u201d. But there is nothing \u201ccomplicated\u201d about dozens of Palestinian children dead at the hands of Israel\u2019s army. There is nothing complicated about the countless videos of IDF soldiers beating, harassing, and murdering innocent civilians. \u201cNuanced understanding\u201d comes when both sides of a disagreement are on equal footing, not when a government authorizes the slaughter of the innocent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSincerely,\n\nA Concerned and Dismayed Student",

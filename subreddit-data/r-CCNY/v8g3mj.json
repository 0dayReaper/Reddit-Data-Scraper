First job out of college?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi there, hoping to hear from some former students what their life is outside of the classroom now that they have some work experience or are solidified in their careers. I was not fortunate enough to land a job after graduating, did find something a few years out, but then lost that job due to the pandemic. Now, I'm trying to get back on my feet, but still hovering around entry-level salary. \n\nHoping someone might have better luck with their trajectory then I might have.",

Somehow landed a job in great company a few months after college after sending out maybe 300+ applications and getting ghosted or rejected by all. It only takes one so just keep applying. Meet only half the requirements? Apply to it. Its gana be worse due to the recession but keep applying. Hit up recruiters on linkedin (better than cold applying)",

We are in a tough situation right now, and everything is hyper competitive. I wouldn\u2019t let that get you down. I have many friends from various institutions that are having the same issue. The only thing that alleviates their struggles is the fact that they are getting significant financial support from their families. \n\nAnother thing that definitely helped was getting my masters (also from ccny). Unfortunately, depending on the field, a masters is the new bachelors /:",

    "postText": "Hey, I got to CUNY CCNY majoring in computer science. I currently work at target and is a freshman. The main reason I even have this job at target is to lighten up my resume as it was completely empty prior. But I was wondering if having retail experience like target will be as helpful to me since I am in a a computer science field, or am I just wasting time here?",

Particularly being patient, consistent, helping accomplish team goals, and working with customers (both external and internal). It's all about how you spin it. It is obviously not 1:1, but use keywords from other job posts to think how your current experience is relevant to it.\n\nEdit:\nI'm not a computer science major, but electrical engineering. I used my Whole Foods retail experience to get tech support roles and even called back to it for some of the engineering internships interviews that I had and subsequently got offers for.",

And learn which programming language you need your primary skills in for your place of work.\n\nThe reason he says this, the actual degree wont help you get a job as much as they claim, having a project in your resume( program, game, app) will mean more than your degree will.  \n\nSo focus on what will give you \"work\" skills more than those that have no end goal achievement.  This is why teachers are hired more than recent grads into tech.",

Retail just says you can deal with people, probably more than other jobs, so you have that.\n\nFocus on your classes. Does Skeith still teach CS 103? If so when he says most of you will not be there by the third year or last year, yeah he's 100% right. It's tough, focus on having good grades first two semesters and getting at least through halfway sophomore you can start focusing more on resume and projects. During summer 2023 you can do a project and try to start getting internships during sophmore year or at the end of it.",

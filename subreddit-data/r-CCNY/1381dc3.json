    "postText": "Hello everyone. I\u2019m an incoming freshman and I\u2019m going to take this math placement test and currently studying for it. I saw the sample test and this test includes calculus unfortunately my broke high school didn\u2019t have any math teacher this year so I didn\u2019t get to take a calculus therefore I know nothing of the subject. \n\nBased from what I have searched not all majors will need all aspects of math. For me I want to major in business management/administration what type of math is needed in that major?\n\nBut my most important question is that does CCNY focus on the math that relates/connect to you major (that you will need for you major) or are they going to look at all of the test? Hypothetically if I were to not to do so great in calculus will they put in a low placement class even if the major I want does not require this type of math?",

It looks like you'll need to take Calc 1 (Math 20100) or Elements of Calculus (Math 20500) in order to graduate with a BA in Business Management &amp; Administration.\n\nClick this link -&gt; [Management &amp; Administration (B.A)](https://ccny-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/programs/MGMTA-BA), &amp; review the *Major Requirements - Required Courses* section\n\nRegarding the placement exam, based on how you did they'll determine which math you're allowed to enroll in. You'll get placed into Math 19000 (algebra), Math 19500 (pre-calc), Calc 1, or Calc 2.\n\nIf you get placed into MATH 19000 or MATH 19500 you have the option to take a [\\~5-week summer course](https://www.cipass.cuny.edu/programs/math-summer-bridge/) at CCNY to possibly not need to take that class for a full semester. But just know that you'll need to pass an exam at the end of the summer program.",

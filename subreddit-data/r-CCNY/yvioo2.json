    "postText": "I'm transferring for Fall 2023 because I missed the spring deadline. Before I can submit the application, I need to make sure this is the CUNY school for me. Here are my questions:\n\nAre the undergrad courses only good for premed? Is the department welcoming towards non-premed students? \nOn average, how good are the professors for physics, biology, orgo, calc, and stats? Who should I take, who should I avoid? \nHow is the tutoring center? Are there tutors available for the more difficult and upper classes like orgo, genetics, and calc based stats?",

    "postText": "Future sophomore here.\n\nI'm at this school because of a scholarship. Though, the one downside seems to be it's a commuter school. \n\nI kind of want to live independently, rather than commuting from my parents', but I'm kind of unfamiliar how these types of schools work compared to a traditional college. I probably should've taken this into account before choosing this college. \n\nHow do students live on their own? \n\nAlso, there's no cafeteria, so that complicates matters too.",

For my undergrad, I lived at home, since I was still in the city. Some people choose to get housing in the dorms at the Towers, so if you're looking for that dorm-life, that's an option. When I was in school, some also sublet, or put down their name for an apartment. \n\nIt's not easy, but not impossible. \n\nBest of luck!",

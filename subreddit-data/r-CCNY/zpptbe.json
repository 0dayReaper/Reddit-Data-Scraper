I know that Grove does not allow you to have any math or science grade below C in order to apply, but can I still apply if I got an F in a class, but retook it and received a score of C or higher? \n\nOr am I guaranteed rejected and my life is over?",

If getting into Grove means a lot to you, they'll be able to show you a path to success.   \n\nYou can do this!  Keep your eye on the prize!",

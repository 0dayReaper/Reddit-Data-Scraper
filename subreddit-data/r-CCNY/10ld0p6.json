The neighborhood around it is safe I\u2019ve never had a problem even if it\u2019s Harlem ( there may be interesting characters walking around sometimes but they don\u2019t bother anybody)",

If not available, walk with a friend. No friends, just walk with other CCNY students. Also don't take the steep hill down in the dark.",

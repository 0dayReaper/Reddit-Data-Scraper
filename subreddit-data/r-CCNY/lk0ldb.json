Hope you\u2019re doing well! For my AP Research class, I\u2019m doing an experiment about the correlation between SAT and high school GPA on CUNY admissions. I need participants for my survey. So, I was wondering if you\u2019d be interested in taking a short survey and help me collect data. Your help will be immensely appreciated! If you have any questions please contact me through my email, don\u2019t hesitate! Please send to other people who are in CUNY to allow this to spread more!\n\n[https://forms.gle/d2W7N2ycRkCzNCYD8](https://forms.gle/d2W7N2ycRkCzNCYD8)",

I know I'ma be a outlier due to my super senior status..... \n\n\nAlso I transfered in (gpa resets if you change colleges), I know a good portion of college students transfer in or change majors. Idk your project exactly just it might be something you can consider next time.",

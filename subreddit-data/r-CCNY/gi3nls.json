    "postText": "Hi CCNY folks,\n\nI am starting grad school in computer engineering in fall and looking for people to rent a place with. Rent in the area has somewhat dropped in the face of the recent events, now is the time to start the search!\n\nIt is currently 2 of us in the housing group and we are looking for 1-2 more flatmates to get a 3-4 bedroom. We are looking for people alike to potentially hang together and have deep conversations on various topics. We are looking at Morningside, West Harlem, Hamilton Heights and the price range of $800-$1K per month per room.\n\nMe (person 0): Outgoing, well travelled, spend most of the time at the lab in steinman. On the weekends I go on spontaneous backpacking trips, or sometimes I go dancing blues/swing/contemp. From Ukraine.\n\nPerson 1: Goes to FIT, makes visual art and clothes, plays guitar. From Hawaii.",

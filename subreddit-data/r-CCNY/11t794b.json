    "postText": "Hi! I just got into a grad program and am wondering about the commute (north academic center). I currently leave downtown on the east side (alphabet city/east village area). I am thinking about moving to the west side - Chelsea or Hell\u2019s Kitchen if I decide to go to school there. Can anyone let me know how they get there from downtown and if you think it\u2019s doable if it\u2019s a full time program?",

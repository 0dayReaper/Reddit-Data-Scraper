    "postText": "Hey guys!  \nHow soon before tuition is due (July 14) should I be applying for student loans through CUNY first? I\u2019m currently waiting for a scholarship approval and should be receiving a final decision within the next few days. However, I\u2019m concerned I will not hear back before tuition is due so I may need to request a loan to cover tuition for the fall semester.",

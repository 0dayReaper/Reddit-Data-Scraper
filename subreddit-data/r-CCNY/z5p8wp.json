If you guys have any material i could study from please let me know, i'm not good at math so it would really help. Also what do i need to enter the ccny campus? It'll be the first time i go to ccny at all so i dont know what to take with me. Please and thank you.",

You can even check the email that they send you or look online to see what they ask for. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of algebra on there, like complex equations you have to solve. Study a lot for it if you want to be placed into a higher math class. Just go over algebra, be very strong at it, go over geometry as well. like finding SIN/COS/TAN angles. It\u2019s multiple choice btw. \n\nI studied and got placed into Precalc.",

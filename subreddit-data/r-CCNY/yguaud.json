    "postText": "hi, so i\u2019m a high school senior looking at colleges to apply for a BS in Computer Science. i heard that CCNY offers a CS program and I was wondering if it\u2019s any good? I also heard that it has an engineering school and i was wondering how it\u2019s like and if it\u2019s good? are there a lot of interenships opportunities? how are the professors like? any/all comments is appreciated. thank you.",

            "comment": "i attend ccny and my intended major is CS. however, after finding out that there are many requirements to get INTO the engineering school, which CS is under, i decided to transfer colleges. I\u2019m currently a freshman. If you do not get accepted into the school of engineering, you\u2019ll have to transfer. The transfer requirements are a lot of science classes &amp; math, and even though it doesn\u2019t explicitly state, you need physics. You also need A\u2019s in all classes. They\u2019re very picky about \u201cperfect\u201d students. So, if you don\u2019t get placed into the engineering school when you get your acceptance, but still want to get in &amp; TRY getting into grove, sure you can. But, it\u2019s kind of difficult &amp; even if u have all the requirements, it isn\u2019t guaranteed acceptance. CCNY does have a pretty strong CS program though, and a lot of great opportunities. Sorry if this was harsh, I just wanted to let you know beforehand since no one was here to guide me. Good luck with acceptance! By the way, if you have a strong background in science &amp; math, they will definitely take that into consideration when giving you acceptance. So, if you took up to calculus &amp; took physics that\u2019s good!!",

            "comment": "it\u2019s alright, they make things a hell of a lot harder than they have to be for the coursework. apply for sure, but just be ready to put in a lot of work. and as the first commenter said, if you don\u2019t get into grove off the rip(out of high school), might as well transfer back out, chances of you getting into it and actually being your major are slim to none afterwards, they\u2019re very choosey with inter-major transfers to the school of engineering, where the CS major is. I got in through high school and transferred out(mechanical engineering, not CS) because it was just overall a not-that-good experience for me. the programs are decent, and with it being the biggest STEM cuny, the opportunities are pretty good, just be prepared to do a metric crap ton of work.",

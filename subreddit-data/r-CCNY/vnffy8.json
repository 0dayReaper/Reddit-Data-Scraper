So what are some other great graduate-level courses that you recommend? Assumption is it'll have to be at City College, or some other CUNY-level college. Thanks in advance.",

The class was CHALLENGING, but in such a rewarding way.  It taught me so much about civic action, citizenship, and education, and I am so happy to have had the opportunity to be one of her students.  That said, it was a LOT of work, and there is no cutting corners, very little slack given.  If you take it, you should be prepared to give it your all.",

Really late reply, but I currently attend Macaulay at CCNY and although I don't study engineering, a lot of my friends do and they really enjoy it / are feeling challenged in their courses. It's a great engineering school but the facilities probably aren't going to be as great as Stonybrook's just from the amount of money you pay (which is not much thanks to Macaulay). Hope this helps!

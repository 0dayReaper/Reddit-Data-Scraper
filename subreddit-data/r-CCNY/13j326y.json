    "postText": "For background I'm a freshman, in my second semester now, and a psychology major. Applied Statistics is a mandatory course for my major. I currently have a 62% in the class. I feel like dropping it because I have a strong sense that I will not pass the final exam. I've done poorly on the tests, and my homework grades aren't helping either. I feel like in order to pass this class I would need a B or an A in the final exam, which I strongly believe isn't possible for me because the course material is very challenging for me. I plan on talking to an advisor today, but I just want other people's opinions. What would you do in this situation?\nWould it be best to drop it or keep it?",

How many classes/credits, and how difficult are they for you (the other classes) \n\nYou can turn around a grade, but you are getting late in the semester, and you have other classes that are sucking up time, it may be best to drop.\n\nDo you have a job? Take care of anyone? Those also play a big part in time.\n\nI made the mistake of taking too many difficult courses my 3rd semester and had to drop one after about a month. \n\nGood luck!",

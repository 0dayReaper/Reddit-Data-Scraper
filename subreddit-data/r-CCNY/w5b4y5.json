    "postText": "He had been teaching at City College of New York for quite some time. He was an adjunct in the art department and taught introduction to art, introduction to drawing, and some other various courses. I always thought he was an accomplished professor, and loved his teaching style. I know he was quite old when I had him as a student, so curious to know if anyone else had him, or knows if he still teaches at the school. I lost contact with him a couple of years ago.",

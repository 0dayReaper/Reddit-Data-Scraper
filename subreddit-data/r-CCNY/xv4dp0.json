I was stupid and I saw the email by the IT desk to fill out that form like 2 weeks too late. Now idt I\u2019m getting emails because of that. \n\nI tried emailing the guy again but he hasn\u2019t responded yet. Should I just try to email him again? Also, anyway, that form wasn\u2019t working when I clicked on it\u2026 was that the case for anyone else or was it bc I clicked on it way past when I was supposed to fill it out?\n\nThanks \ud83d\ude4f",

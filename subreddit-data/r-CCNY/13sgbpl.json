I emailed the math department with like a request to retake the course, but other than that is there anything I can do? Kinda worried it\u2019ll fill up and I\u2019ll lose access to Calc 2 and physics for the fall. Anything helps!",

The pass rate for Calc 2 at CCNY is not good and the professors cannot teach.  You will be teaching yourself for sure.  Tutors will help but still 10-15% pass with a C or above.  You need to fill out a form to request the ability to transfer it in, but it is worth it.",

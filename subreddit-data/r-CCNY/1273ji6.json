(I currently have a stable career in another field and am a published author, so I won't be full-time/broke)\n2. Is it a good program?\n3. Are there any scholarships?\n4. Is it remote?\n\nCan't find this info on the website. Thanks!",

MFA students usually have the option to write a creative seminar paper, though some professors don't (you'd have to write an analytical / research paper). \n\nI have gotten a lot out of the MA program. Professors are great, course offerings are pretty diverse, and there's Mark Mirsky--a real gem!!",

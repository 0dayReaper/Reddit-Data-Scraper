    "postText": "Hi.  I am a freshman starting in the fall.  I was accepted into the Grove School of engineering pending taking the math placement exam and passing to Calc 1 level.  I took calc 1 at a college this spring via dual enrollment, passed with a B and the course transferred in as Calc 1 at CCNY.  The grade i got on the Math placement test puts me at the Precalc level (I did not know we needed to memorize all of the formulas for the test).  So CCNY will not make me take Precalc and Calc 1 again, correct?  How will the affect if I get into the Grove college?  thanks!",

Note: Pre calc is a pre requisite if you want to take chemistry.\n\nAnd when you say \u201cpending taking exam\u201d, you mean you still haven\u2019t taken it as far as I understand, but then you are saying you were placed into pre calc? Not sure if I understand this.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s a \u201ctest\u201d and they explicitly mention the things that are going to be on the test, so this is a lame excuse, plus if you were taking calculus, you should have had majority of the stuffs from pre calc and trig memorized.\n\nLastly, I\u2019d advise you to contact the CCNY admission team or the advisors.",

I took the pre-test they provided and did well - no formulas were needed.  In any case, thanks for your response. As a freshman I was accepted to Grove pending taking the math test and testing into Calc 1.  My question is since I already passed Calc 1 with a B and it transferred into CCNY, would they make me take precalc and calc 1 again.  I have my advisor meeting this week, but was looking for a little insight before the meeting.",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019ll be attending my first semester at City College this spring. I was reading through other Reddit posts and reviews online about The Towers and I\u2019ve heard you could find apartments with cheaper rent than what you pay at The Towers.\n\nAny advice going about finding an apartment in the area though? Semester starts in less than a month so a bit of a time crunch- if I can\u2019t find anything then I\u2019ll just have to dorm. Thanks",

Summer is usually the best time to find an apartment but now is still doable. I would also consider doing a 4/5 month sublet so you could get a place for the semester and then consider more long term for fall semester",

            "comment": "Hi there, I graduated from the same program you are referring to in the post. The reason it is two-years is because this major is supposedly for entering juniors. If you are coming in with 90-credits, I would speak to the Program Director and ask if you can do what is called a \"fast-track\" option. \n\nBut normally, most students take 2-3 advertising/public relations courses a semester, and fill the rest of their schedule with internships or electives. I would suggest partaking in an internship, because it'll really give you a leg-up for when you graduate. Since you've satisfied that component, I would try corelating your schedule to be more AD/PR classes towards your final semester. The classes all build upon each other, so it's tough, but do-able. \n\nThe AD/PR major isn't as many credits as a normal Bachelor's.",

            "comment": "You can't fail the math placement exam, which is a good thing :) Basically, based on how you did on all exam topics, they'll determine which math class you're allowed to enroll in. You'll get placed into Math 19000 (algebra), Math 19500 (pre-calc), Calc 1, or Calc 2.\n\n\rNote: If you get placed into Math 19000 or Math 19500 you have the option to take a \\~5-week summer course at CCNY to possibly not need to take that class for a full semester. But just know that you'll need to pass an exam at the end of the summer program.\n\n\rHere's the link to the summer program if you're interested -&gt; [Math Summer Bridge - CIPASS](https://www.cipass.cuny.edu/programs/math-summer-bridge/)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",

You might know more than you think \ud83d\ude0c  It's gonna be okay! Regardless on where you get placed just know that it's important to have a strong foundation of math skills so that you'll be more successful in Calc 1. There's no shame in needing to take extra classes \ud83d\udc99",

I took algebra 2 and pre-calc remotely during COVID and maybe I didn\u2019t retain as much learning from home in bed.  Even if taking algebra 2 again is a setback, it is better than struggling in a class I\u2019m not prepared for.  And if algebra 2 is easy then it will make my first semester at CCNY go more smoothly.",

There are some study guides you can access on Blackboard. By the way, I also expect to experience some setbacks but at the end of the day, you'll still get your degree. It's about perseverance &lt;3 You got this! Go at your own pace and enjoy your academic experience :)",

    "postText": "hey guys! basically i got a rejection today as a biology BS undergrad student and i was pretty blind sided by it because i have relatively high stats. my school had an issue with submitted transcripts and mine got submitted after decisions started coming out and i\u2019m positive that was a big factor in this rejection. i emailed the office admissions and plan on sending a letter of continued interest but could someone let me know on what to do? decision day is super close and CCNY is where i want to go DESPITE the many scholarships i got from private colleges. do they reverse decisions? is that a thing? plz help",

I didn\u2019t get accepted, but they did accept me as an undeclared major, from there I can switch to grove college after meeting some requirements. So yes, they may reverse ur decision,  it for the program ur seeking, but maybe as an undeclared major to where u can transfer over.",

If you want to see an example of an appeal, scroll down in this subreddit until you see a picture of a rejection letter, posted by someone named bengistan, 42 days ago. I did something similar to that, but I did not make mine too emotional. I added some solid reasons to why I think I still have the skills to apply. For example, since I wanted to be a CS major, I put a link to my GitHub to where I have few projects that display my understanding of algorithms and data structures. Also remember it\u2019s important to not sound arrogant. \n\nBut your situation is very different. The decision deadline is may 1st. I sent my appeal one month ago, and only got my response few days ago. I would advice you to call them as soon as possible and ask wether u can still send in an appeal. Hope things work out for u.",

    "postText": "I graduated back in 2016, so it's a homecoming and reunion of sorts. I had so many places to eat on campus; halal food, Subway's, McDonald's, the NAC Cafe, Cafe One, deli across Amsterdam or Convent. What are some new places to eat?\n\nMainly looking for pasta, or rice, or sandwiches. You know, college-people food. \n\nThanks.",

            "comment": "The McDonalds is no longer there! The NAC Cafe upgraded and it\u2019s not longer the same /: Cafe one is still good. Halal is a classic. Fumo across the street has some amazing Italian food. It\u2019s pricy but so good. Next to it is their pizza place and it\u2019s awesome. And next to that is an Indian place. They have a lunch buffet that\u2019s filling. The Grange is also pricy but very good. For fresh juices I like yellow banana. The delis are all also pretty good",

Welp they chased out the food vendors, and for the following semester there was NO food from the area. It was utterly ridiculous. Ever since then it wasn't the same although I graduated around 2 years ago. There was 1 vendor and basically that was it.",

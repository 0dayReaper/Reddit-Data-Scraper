    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m not entirely sure if posting this in the CCNY subreddit is okay. \n\nI am helping a friend in City College\u2019s film program raise funds for his thesis film. I\u2019m sure he would greatly appreciate any type of support. Sharing the link, spreading the word, small donations, anything really. You can read more about his cause on his gofundme https://www.gofundme.com/f/a-bfa-thesis-film?utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=customer](https://www.gofundme.com/f/a-bfa-thesis-film?utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=customer) He has also linked his Instagram and YouTube in the description if you want to check out his work. \n\nThank you so much!",

How does spring registration work for freshman? Do we have to meet with advisors again or do we register to classes according to our degree works on our own? Also when does registration begin and when does spring semster begin? Thanks",

This means you can't pick classes for the next semester yet. Once you make an appointment and have a meeting with your advisor, he or she will tell you what classes you can take and answer any questions you will have. After the meeting (it's like 10mins tops) they remove the hold and you can pick classes for next semester. \n\n\nYou can still view and add classes to your shopping cart on cuny first, you just won't be able to sign up for them untill you get the hold removed. Sign up date is some where in November (I think it's the 5th) so you have time. Email your advisor now so you can get the meeting before then. \n\n\nIf you met your advisor during October your probably fine. Just check cuny first to see if you have a hold or not. Holds are listed on the right side.",

Some programs/majors just have too many people to require everyone to come in. Generally most do try to advise freshman though. \n\n\nIf you don't have an advising hold, or any other holds on your account your probably good to pick classes. I would still double check with an advisor about what classes to take and the path you're on, since you're still a freshman.\n\n\nFinancial aid holds usually resolve themselves towards the end of the semester when the school gets it's money. So I don't think you have to worry about that",

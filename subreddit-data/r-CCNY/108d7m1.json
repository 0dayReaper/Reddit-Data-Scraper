    "postText": "Hey everyone! \n\nSo I\u2019m a 2021 B.S. computer science grad, and after a year of job chasing I\u2019m thinking of applying to CCNY for the grad data science program. I was wondering if anyone on here had any experience with that specific program or other similar programs and could share what it\u2019s like in terms of difficulty, professors, and life in general as a student. \n\nMuch appreciated!",

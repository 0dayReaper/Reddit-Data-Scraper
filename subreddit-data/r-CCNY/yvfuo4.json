I applied to Groove as an EE major but i didn\u2019t get in because of a certain requirement. \n\nI need to complete a survey and select a major for the mean time. I would like to know if anyone was in this situation and which major was more suitable to make it easier to transition into groove",

The transfer to Grove is not easy, I remember that. But you might have a better chance of completing all your requirements by choosing something like math or physics. The engineering classes are only open to engineering students so you won\u2019t be able to get ahead in those",

So you have to wait for someone to fail out of the program to be accepted /: and they have to be the year you are applying for. Ei: you are a sophomore but a junior drops then you cannot take their seat. You need a sophomore to drop. \n\nAt least that what was told to me when I was there. I\u2019m not sure if anything has changed. I had waited til my junior year to transfer but realized I couldn\u2019t wait any longer and decided on a different major.",

Take the required math &amp; science classes before applying. Note: For math, if you did not get into Grove, you need to have taken and passed Calculus 1, Calculus 2, and the Physics-based Calculus class, in order to apply to Grove.",

In the semester(s) that you are not in Grove, take whatever other classes you need.

Maybe CSC 102, maybe liberal arts classes? Physics 208? Linear Algebra? Differential Equations? \n\nThere should definitely be some classes you can take before you take EE classes so you dont waste your time at CCNY.  Let me know if you have any other questions.",

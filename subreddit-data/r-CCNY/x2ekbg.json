    "postText": "Hi, so I'm a commuter student from Westchester hoping to start driving to school soon instead of taking the train. Taking the train, bus, and all that waiting time is just too much and I think it would be better to drive to school. Do you guys have any recommendations on where to park where it's not too expensive? Any advice on parking is appreciated. Thank you!",

When I park in the parking garage from 9-6 I paid $26 (kind of expensive) but ended up paying relatively the same amount taking the train. No tips but also trying to find a work around \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude2d",

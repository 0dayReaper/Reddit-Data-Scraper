If so how much of it are we supposed to pass so we don\u2019t end up in remedial classes??",

It\u2019ll let the school know how much of the subject you know, and it\u2019ll also help you register for classes since you won\u2019t accidentally register for a harder or easier math class. It won\u2019t affect you at all.",

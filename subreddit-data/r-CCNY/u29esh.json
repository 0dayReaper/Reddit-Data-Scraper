    "postText": "City College of New York has not sent a single email in regards to the MASS SHOOTING that happened on the subway today. Some students come from that area, and most take the D to get to school. There has been a lot of fun violence this year, but most have been gang related. Today, there was a mass shooting where random people were shot for no apparent reason, in a transportation system that most students take to school every day. Do we have any ideas why this wasn\u2019t even acknowledged? I know I don\u2019t feel comfortable going on a subway right now. Anyone else?",

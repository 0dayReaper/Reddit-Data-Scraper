    "postText": "I got an email this week saying CCNY had nominated me to join the Braven Leadership and Career Accelerator course/fellowship. From what I can tell its a career skills building workshop sort of thing, but I had never heard of it before getting the email and haven't been able to find much info online from people who have actually done it. I found 2 reddit posts talking about it at another school that didn't seem super promising, and while it sounds useful I'm worried about taking it on what's already gonna be a bitch of a semester course load wise. Also kind of worried its just straight up a scam haha, although their website is pretty comprehensive and the course seems to be real. \n\nDid anyone else get the same email? Anyone done it or thinking about doing it? Would love a second opinion",

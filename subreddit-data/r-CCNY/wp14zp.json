    "postText": "When I look at the Transfer What-ifs on Degreeworks, it only shows a list of Education BSED programs, but they are all attached to a subject, such as Art, Anthropology, English, etc. Does this mean I will be required to double major(or something like that) and must take a bunch of other classes related to a chosen subject? Or can I just do the BSED in Education, without any subject attached to it, thus requiring less classes. I am asking this because on the CUNY transfer application, it only shows a BSED in education without an attached subject, while in degreeworks, the BSED in education programs that I see are all attached to another subject. \n\nThanks in advance for your help",

            "comment": "Im a psy major. There are some required courses to take : Psy 101, Applied Stats, and Experimental. You would need to fulfill any 3 of the four Gateway Requirements, and 4 advanced courses. I honestly recommend taking Psy 101 ur first semester as well as your general liberal requirement. Then filling out the following semester with a mixture of your required liberal courses, psy major courses, and elective or minor courses. The liberal courses and elective courses should make the semester easier on you. Also check degree works because it tells you the different classes you can choose from. Another thing I recommend is going to ratemy professor. Rate my professor can allow you to see what are the professors like before you take the course. Stay away from bad professor rating if you can. Sometimes the courses are required and you cant get away from it but if you can choose, choose a good or decent rating professor. \n\nHonestly my experience with the Psy department has been very good. Of course there some prof that I didnt enjoy but honestly it was very few (like 2). I try to choose courses that interest me or (if you know what career you would like to do) courses that can benefit me for that career. \n\n[Psy Pathway](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/psychology/psych-undergrad-degree-equirements) -&gt; to see some of the general requirements for a Psy degree. \n\n[DegreeWorks](https://ssologin.cuny.edu/cuny.html?resource_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdegreeworks.cuny.edu%252F) -&gt; its a personalized guide that gives you not only the general courses you are required to take but also there is a selection of courses you can choose from in order to fulfill those requirements. As you take different courses.. Your degree works will fill up. In simple terms, its kinda like a checklist of all the classes you done and how far away you are from completing everything. \n\n[Blackboard](https://ssologin.cuny.edu/cuny.html?resource_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbbhosted.cuny.edu%252Fwebapps%252Flogin%252Fnoportal) -&gt; This is where your classes are going to be. All the content/assignment upload/ discussion board post/ and even where you meet (if everything is still online) (collaborate ultra is the blackboard version of zoom but some professors might choose to meet in zoom instead.) \n\n[cunyfirst ](https://ssologin.cuny.edu/cuny.html?resource_url=https%3A%2F%2Fhome.cunyfirst.cuny.edu%252Fpsp%252Fcnyepprd%252FEMPLOYEE%252FEMPL%252Fh%252F%3Ftab%253DDEFAULT) -&gt; Cunyfirst is used for tuition payments, financial aid, applying for loans, checking your grades, enrolling in classes, getting your 1098-T for taxes. Lots of useful things. \n\n[CCNY Virtual Bookstore ](https://vbslogin.cuny.edu/cuny.html?resource_url=https%3A%2F%2Fvirtualbookstore.cuny.edu%252Fbook)-&gt; Where you can find what books professors want you to get for their course. Honestly .. wait for the first day of class for the prof to tell you what books to get. Sometimes the books listed in the VBS isnt even what they use. Sometimes you can find cheaper alternatives somewhere else instead of buying the book from that website. After my first semester Ive learned to never buy a book from that bookstore because its so damn expensive. Also ... tip go to Library Genesis and you might possibly be able to find the book online to download for free. Sometimes the prof might even tell you that you can use the older versions for the textbook. \n\nAnyways I hope this mightve helped. If I were you I would try to get other students number and make a groupchat. It helps especially if your confused in something or missed something. Usually (since things are online) the first few days students are posting out links to whatsapp or groupme or discord for a class groupchat. Try to get into those to stay in the loop with things. \n\nI hope this helps. If you like psy and you think this is for you then great! The psy department is one of the easiest and chillest departments ever. They are there for you and would help you. Dont worry. You got this! \n\nIf you have any questions or need any help. Im here and you can privately message me. Sorry for the long ass response. :)\n\nAlsoooo.. I highly highly highly recommend taking Career Building with Dr. Thompson in sophomore year! He helps with resume/personal statements/What psy courses to take and what you can expect with a psy degree. Highly recommend. One of the best prof out there. Its also a 300 level class and one of the easiest classes to take.",

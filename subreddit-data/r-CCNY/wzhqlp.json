    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI will be graduating with my Bachelor's in Communications from UNLV this December and am interested in applying for grad school at CCNY during the Spring semester. \n\nTo be quite honest, my GPA isn't the strongest and I should be graduating with around a 3.2. My question is, do you know the minimum GPA requirements to get in? I was looking at applying to the Branding + Integrated Communications program. Does anyone know how competitive CCNY is?",

Right across the street from Compton Goethals, 3 minute walk away from the NAC. If you live at The Towers and want to move out or you are looking to move to West Harlem, this is the apartment for you! Rent is $1,200 a month. We are both students at CCNY. Message me on Instagram for more details, /abcfinnxyz.",

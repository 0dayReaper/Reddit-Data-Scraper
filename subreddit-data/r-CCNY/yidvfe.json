I\u2019m currently intended to major in Computer Science, so I wanted to ask those who are currently in Grove School what their GPA was when they got accepted? \n\nAnd if you want, you can share your thoughts and options on how life is like in GSOE. I know it\u2019s obviously hard, but I just wanted to know how you guys are feeling y\u2019know. \n\nThank you guys. I hope y\u2019all have a great day",

            "comment": "HS GPA? Uhhh, definitely above 3. Had to get strong recommendation letters as well. \n\nIt's hard, it's tough, it's dirty (not literally), it's a grind. Also if you're in CS because you wrote Hello World and make 200k, or think you're gonna be the next Valve or Epic Games, please actually research CS. That's not what CS is. \n\nThere's tough ass professors who are complete jerks. There's some who are great. There are some who are jerks but will like you if you just show you're trying. \n\nSocial wise, I was CpE but I'm sorry to say I felt the CS people felt extremely introverted and barely wanted to talk. CpE I felt much more lively. Think it's just the type of people attracted to CS. But anyways I didn't really care, as I'm not paying to socialize I'm here to study.\n\nYou'll have to figure out if you really like CS as you go through. The first 1-2 years for many of the engineer majors are just the intro stuff. Once you get to the third year you get stuff definitely more catered to specifically what you're doing, and there's much less students. I started having more fun by that point.",

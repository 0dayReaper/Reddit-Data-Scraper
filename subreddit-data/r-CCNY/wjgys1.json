    "postText": "Because of a family emergency I HAD to pay late for dorm. That the towers were aware of. What I did not account for is that my family put in the towers adress(401 W 130th St, New York, NY 10027) as the mailing adress for the check coming from my 529k plan. \n\nI am already 7 days late plus this. This is genuinely so worrying and it could have been prevented if my mother wasn't being lazy and actually handed me MY CONTRACT that she knew was on the family safe rather than lying by saying \"I don't have it\" \n\nGod I hate being 1st gen. \n\nAnyways do ya'll have any advice?",

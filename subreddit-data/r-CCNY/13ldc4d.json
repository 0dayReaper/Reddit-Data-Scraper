I\u2019m interested in going to law school eventually. More so, I wanna major in Econ or Finance. Does anyone have any tips? Should I transfer to Baruch? How\u2019s the ECON department at CCNY?",

Also if you\u2019re interested in law why not major in poli-sci?",

Lots of students in the Collin Powell school double major including myself and that  can be useful later on if you decide to choose one field over the other or just use the skills and classes from both when going into the workforce but it\u2019s good you have a back up plan that can still get you a great job after graduation.",

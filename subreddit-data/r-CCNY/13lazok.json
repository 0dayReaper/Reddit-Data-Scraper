    "postText": "There are so many questions that I have here\u2019s what happened I called today to the testing center to see why I have not gotten a confirmation email of my test I get answer and I thought would be the end of it. The person told me they could make sure that I was scheduled\u2026turns out I\u2019m not and they only have the days of beginning of June and I told the person I would have to see my schedule since I would be busy those days. She told me more days would be opened for later on in June but I would just have to wait and call back again. So one of my question is\u2026\n\nUntil when can you take that math placement test? Is it still open in late June? \n\nAnd now here\u2019s another situation. I think that one of the reasons that I didn\u2019t get any confirmation email or appeared that I was scheduled it\u2019s because of the major I have right now (popular music studies) which obviously does not need math. But now I\u2019m thinking I should do the advising appointment first to change my major once and for all so everything can be truly processed and I could take the math placement test with no problem if that is the issue so this won\u2019t happen again. I go in the Navigate app to try to schedule one as soon as possible for \u201cmajor change\u201d and I see a humanities and arts advisor but can this person help me with changing my major to a business management/administration? I go to \u201cappointments\u201dand then \u201cmy team\u201d and there\u2019s a group of advisers are these the people that can help me with specific things? \n\nWould really be grateful if someone were to answer Im just very confused.",

            "comment": "Business majors are in the Collin Powell division my major is also in that division. Every freshmen needs to take a math placement test to my knowledge. If you want to change your major you need to go to IDeclare ccny and change it there and once approved by the department chair of the new major registar will process the change and you\u2019ll get the notification to your ccny email. Once you change your major you can make an appointment with a Collin Powell advisor. As far as testing dates the last day  I\u2019m not sure on that but you should be taking the test as soon as possible so you can get advised and be able to enroll in classes. You don\u2019t want to wait until the last minute and are stuck with classes you may not like and/or bad teachers cause the good ones filled up. Once they release the June dates try and take it they release dates for the next 2-3 weeks at a time so you won\u2019t be able to know about late June until it\u2019s released. If they\u2019re telling you to wait and call back that\u2019s all you can do unfortunately we can\u2019t tell you when a certain day or week will open or how long it\u2019s going for.",

So I don\u2019t know what help I can get with that.  Also I called two months ago asking about the major change and told me I would have to talk to my advisor to do that no one told me about the process ur talking about.",

If you had a regular outlook email you could but since it\u2019s a school email you need to get the outlook app if you want to have the app to get  easy access to your emails.  IDeclare is usually where you  go to change, add  a new major and minor  an advisor can\u2019t change it for you so maybe if you meet with an an advisor they will show you how to do it  is maybe what they meant. If you claimed your ccny account then you already set up a username and password so go to google and type in I-Declare ccny  like I said earlier it should be the first link log in and it\u2019s gonna be a button that says  start the I-declare process click on that you\u2019re gonna select Collin Powell where it says select school since you said you\u2019re trying to change to be a business major and under plan select management and administration once you submit you\u2019re gonna get an email to your ccny email confirming your request to change your major and once the department chair approves it you will get an email about it.",

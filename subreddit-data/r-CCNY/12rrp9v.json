    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI recently accepted my enrollment offer to City College and paid the commitment deposit to CCNY and I have proof that I did (on both the my city website and proof of receipt) but for some reason my CUNYFIRST account says I am student of Queens College? I don\u2019t know why. It also said I paid a commitment deposit to them but I didn\u2019t? I\u2019m so confused. Also for CCNY, they changed my intended major from CS to Undeclared and both of my start terms for Queens and CCNY to summer of 2023 from fall of 2023? Please if anyone knows what to do I\u2019d really appreciate the help.  I don\u2019t know what to do, I want to go to CCNY not Queens College and do CS (the major I applied for) and start fall of 2023.",

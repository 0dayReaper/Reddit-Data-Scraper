    "postText": "**About Cobble**\n\nCobble is an app that ends decision fatigue, by combining awesome ideas with a smart agreement tool, to come to a quick consensus and make sh\\*t happen. Our mission is to get people back out into the world, doing the things they love, with the people they care about. No more \u201cI don\u2019t know...what do you want to do?\u201d and it\u2019s faster, easier, and way more fun than texting back and forth.\n\nWe do this through a combination of excellent curated content, and a suite of social decision-making tools. Better than discovering your new favorite restaurant, TV show, or a one-time event? Actually doing it, because that\u2019s what Cobble is made for. Not another list app. A do it app.\n\nWe are an early stage company, launched in June of 2020, growing at the speed of light. Now we\u2019re expanding into new markets, as we make Cobble a household name, and want to do it with a bang!\n\n**About The Role**\n\nWe are looking for passionate, motivated social creators to help spread the word and educate the masses! As an unpaid freelance opportunity, it's a great way to expand your online presence and collaborate with our growing brand. Plus, there's a chance to win some exciting prizes as a Cobble social creator. We love to reward our top performers for their creativity and impact on our brand awareness. \n\n**What you\u2019ll do**\n\n* Acquire an intimate understanding of the app and how it works.\n* You would be responsible for producing content relevant to TikTok and Instagram.\n* Content should appeal to the best ways to use and benefit from Cobble\u2019s various features.\n   * Lo-fi shots on iPhone video &amp; photos.\n   * Quickly edit to optimize for social media engagement + performance.\n* Be an ambassador of Cobble\u2019s brand, mission, and the work you create by influencing or referring to new app downloads.\n* Create much as you like and on your own schedule, but roughly 1 submission per week.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED, PLEASE SHARE LINKS TO YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA &amp; ANY OTHER RELEVANT CONTENT TO TAYLOR@TRYCOBBLE.COM",

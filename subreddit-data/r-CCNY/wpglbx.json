My biggest worry right now is parking around campus, I was just wondering if parking is hard to find or where people recommend parking. On the streets around campus or even paying for a parking garage? Obviously this is NYC so parking probably isn\u2019t easy but if anyone has any advice I\u2019d appreciate it!",

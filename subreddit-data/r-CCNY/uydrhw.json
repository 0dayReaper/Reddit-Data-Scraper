    "postText": "I've been accepted to Class of 2024, on a full-ride scholarship for graduate school! \n\nI cannot believe it. This is still sinking in, but I wanted to just share. I graduated from City College of New York back in 2016. At the time, Michelle Obama was my guest-speaker. It was the opportunity of a lifetime to get her wisdom and guidance as my commencement speaker. \n\nToday, I just received notice that not only have I been enrolled back at City College, this time as a graduate student, but I'm going on a full-ride, tuition-free. \n\nThe years after graduating from 2016 - now are a bit depressing, but I am coming back and I can't wait to walk up fifteen flights of stairs, not be able to use the elevator, buy coffee from the NAC, and cry in the halls of Shephard. Visit the Marshak, and sit in lecture halls.\n\nAnd get halal food on the trucks. Hopefully the school hasn't changed much.",

When the semester gets closer to starting, maybe July or August, contact them and ask to discuss about more info on their work and maybe inquire about potential research opportunities.  Getting an early start on research will put you on a great path to success.  \u2014  Focus on interesting work from the get go and your education will feel worth it and be worth it",

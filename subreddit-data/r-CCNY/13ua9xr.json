    "postText": "* Does being labeled as a Non-Degree mean I'm taking the classes for fun or not for any major? I already have a major declared for my studies at CCNY when I start in the fall, and if that's the case, why is it saying that I'm a non degree student?\n* Does resident student mean you live on campus, or that you live in NYC/NY State?\n\nI'm asking because I'm not sure why it's labeling me as a non degree and a non resident student when enrolling in summer classes as an incoming freshmen who lives in NYC and has a declared major starting in the fall, or does it not recognize me bc I'm only coming from high school?",

    "postText": "Hello!! I am a prospective grad student at CCNY in the Sustainability in the Urban Environment program. \n\nI am curious if any other graduate students have any insights into what they wish they had known before starting at CCNY? I am going to grad school to facilitate career change, and have been out of undergrad for a couple of years. I would also be moving from the midwest, so definitely a new environment. \n\nI'm really looking for an environment where I can learn new skills which can directly translate into a productive career in sustainability/ urban green space. \n\nSecond ask; when looking into where to live, I would love any advice. I have friends living in Astoria and would really like to live there, but am not sure if the commute would be too much of a killer. How is the bus and/or subway between Queens and the CCNY campus? I'm familiar with the subway so I know what to generally be looking out for, but any major considerations?\n\nAny hints are helpful while I make my final decisions!",

The trains are a little distance from the school to me. CCNY has different buildings but I don\u2019t think any building is really near the train. Most people take advantage of the shuttle at 145th if it\u2019s there when they get off the train.",

            "comment": "Depending on the specific part of Astoria you're in, you might be close to the M60 bus which goes right over the ridge and across 125th- you'll have your choice of buses or trains to cover getting you up the hill. Pretty easy via subway- one transfer in Manhattan once you're on your line of choice. I budget a little more than an hour to cushion MTA bullshit, especially since I commute off-peak.",

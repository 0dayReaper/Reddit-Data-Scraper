I just received an offer from CCNY but I am still struggling which school that I should choose to attend, and I did really heard a lot of negative reviews about CCNY computer science. Can someone share about their experiences? I want to know more about it, because my cousin recommends me choose CCNY.  \nThanks in advance:)",

I always enjoyed the gothic style architecture and the new research buildings on the south lawn, one of my favorite things to enjoy between classes. In warm weather you can hang out in the quad or the south lawn by the Towers. Additionally, the whole city is your playground. You can hop on a short train ride to Central Park, Fort Tryon Park, the High Line etc. there\u2019s good food places around campus. Coffee places too. Bars. I would suggest joining a club and making friends through shared interests. It takes a second to make friends. But it\u2019ll be easy to find friends if you\u2019re a friend to everyone. \n\nTo be honest, I found ccny to be a little harsh at times. But it reaalllyyy prepared me for the \u2018real world\u2019. Take advantage of everything and anything early on. Then it becomes your second home",

I hear some horror stories about classrooms falling apart in other CUNY schools, and I'm wondering if CCNY has the same problem.",

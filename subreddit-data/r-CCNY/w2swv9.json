    "postText": "Going to be a broke college student again. Returning for my master's. So looking for ways to cut down on funds. That being said, what are some meals or snacks you bring to campus for lunch? Curious to know, since it'll need to be transportable, something easy to eat, and likely okay to be eaten cold? Not sure if microwaves are available on campus. Thought about peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but I often like my bread toasted and don't want to be confined to a toaster, let alone don't know where to find one, and don't want to pre-toast, which defeats the point of toasting.",

Cilantro lime rice is easy to make if you\u2019re into that, too. \n\nThere\u2019s microwaves in and around the main cafeteria at the NAC building (at least back when I attended). I\u2019m sure they\u2019re still there.",

And cheap instant noodles, of which I replace the default spices with a small sauce mix I can make 50+ portions of per set of sauce bottles I need to mix it\n\nThe sauce is one unit ketjap, one unit worcestershiresauce (or lemon or lime juice), one unit mirrin (or sugar or honey), some garlic paste, ginger paste and sambal. You can premix it into a bottle and keep it in the fridge for weeks. You can also use it for other Asian recipes.",

That will last me one work week with some snacks like a package of miniature Paydays or nestle crunch bars. The next week it will be homemade wraps with chips. The next week it will be homemade mini pizzas that I reheat in the toaster oven on a piece of foil at the company kitchen. The next it will be penne pasta I fixed with jarred sauce and shredded Parmesan cheese and homemade garlic bread. It\u2019s easier to buy for the same meal for a week than try to change up it every day",

Buy meat in bulk and immediately freeZe portions so you dont have to go to the store all the time. If you can find a crock pot at the thrift store get it. Make dishes with meat and beans to stretch protiens and save money. Eggs are always a good idea. You can do alot with eggs veg and cheese. Make frittata\u2019s",

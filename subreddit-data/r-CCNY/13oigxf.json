But with that being said, I think my best bet is to transfer to another CUNY (BK is the plan right now) and start better from the get go.",

If you look at Niche, it ranks CCNY's program 26th best in NY, and there are 2 or 3 other CUNY's ranked better (Hunter, Lehman and even Baruch I think).  If engineering is your passion, there are other schools with much better support for students that have better programs.",

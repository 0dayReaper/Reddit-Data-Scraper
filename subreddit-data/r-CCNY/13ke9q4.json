Have you met with an advisor yet to get advised for classes they can usually help with this and I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019re a incoming grove school student. I know pre-calc is a pre-requisite for calc 1 but the AP exam you took was it for a calculus class ? Also I\u2019m not sure if what score you get will have bearing on your math classes because every incoming freshman needs to take the math placement test and that test depending on your score determines what math class you will be placed in. If you score in the range needed for calc 1 that\u2019s the math class you will be placed in but since you\u2019re asking about pre-calc  have you taken the test and was placed in pre-calc ? The test is required even if you are  taking or took AP or college level classes in  high school. Have you taken the test yet ?So realistically even if you score well on your AP exam but don\u2019t get the score needed on the placement test to take calc pre-calc is what you will be placed in to improve your math skills to get you fraud for calc 1.",

If you\u2019re taking an AP calculus class which is obviously higher then pre-calc I don\u2019t doubt your ability to have done good to test into calc 1 straight. Good luck and update after meeting with an advisor !",

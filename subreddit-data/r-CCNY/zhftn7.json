    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am in my senior year of high school and I have been considering going to City College for a mechanical engineering degree, however, I've heard that it takes you longer than four years to graduate from CCNY because sometimes classes can be full and you have to wait a whole semester to take them. Is that true?",

            "comment": "Ditto the other guy said. Also I'm sure it was looked at but it's more of a nation wide thing that in general engineering degrees are no longer 4 years, and it's common to take 4.5-5 years. I took 5. You'll fail a class maybe, or you couldn't get into one. YOU NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR SCHEDULING. You don't have to listen to the counselor, but you need to thoroughly plan everything out. That includes just college and engineering in general or you won't make it. If I couldn't take a class, I tried to plan around taking a class in the summer. Yes gasp a summer class. If you have to do it just do it. Idk why people hated it so much anyways. Get the credit twice as fast, easier to focus on 1-2 classes, and the professors are more one on one since it's less people.",

            "comment": "Classes fill up fast but you just need to be on-top of dates. They\u2019ll tell you when your registration will open up. The classes that you\u2019ll have most trouble with getting will come as you get closer to your degree as they become more specific. The general ed classes, STEM, such as English and Math will have a much wider selection and multiple offerings, as long as you don\u2019t fuss over Professors. \n\nAnd if you have open availability and don\u2019t mind any hours, even better! \n\nYou can take 4-5 classes a semester, but don\u2019t go in too strong to finish faster, burn out is real. Engineering is competitive and you don\u2019t want your grades to suffer.\n\nThere are also other ways to finish faster, summer and winter classes.\n\nSome courses are only offered Fall or Spring, but that won\u2019t be relevant until your third year probably \n\nI suggest meeting with an advisor who can provide a schedule example, a general one or an engineer advisor",

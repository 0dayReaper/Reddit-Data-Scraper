Is that true? Currently senior in high school and need to choose a school by may 1. BMCC and CCNY r the only ones I care about too",

            "comment": "i attend ceny and my intended major is CS. however, after finding out that there are many requirements to get INTO the engineering school, which CS is under, i decided to transfer colleges. I'm currently a freshman. If you do not get accepted into the school of engineering, you'll have to transfer. The transfer requirements are a lot of science classes &amp; math, and even though it doesn't explicitly state, you need physics. You also need A's in all classes. They're very picky about \"perfect\" students. So, if you don't get placed into the engineering school when you get your acceptance, but still want to get in &amp; TRY getting into grove, sure you can. But, it's kind of difficult &amp; even if u have all the requirements, it isn't guaranteed acceptance. CCNY does have a pretty strong CS program though, and a lot of great opportunities. Sorry if this was harsh, I just wanted to let you know beforehand since no one was here to guide me. Good luck with acceptance! By the way, if you have a strong background in science &amp; math, they will definitely take that into consideration when giving you acceptance. So, if you took up to calculus &amp; took physics that's good!!",

However my first semesters physics grade were not good(65,75,75 average throughout first 3 marking periods). Doing a bit better now tho. My pre calc average last semester were 85-90s but they\u2019ve dropped this semester because I got really bad grades for my quizzes(to like 70-80 average). What do you think about it for grove?",

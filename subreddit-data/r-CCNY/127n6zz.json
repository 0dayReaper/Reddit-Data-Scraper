    "postText": "Hello All! Still trying to make my grad school decision. I'm wondering what the student life is like at CCNY? Are there orgs I can get involved with as a grad student, and is it generally easy to make friends (at the library, in classes, during events etc)?\n\nAlso, are there any good ways for me to get in touch with current students so I can learn more about the program I'm considering (Sustainability in the Urban Environment MS)?\n\nI thought I would know what to do after visiting campus, but I'm still feeling unsure.\n\nAny insight is helpful :)",

The university has a lot of events and there are clubs for different areas of study.\n\nBut at the end of the day CCNY is a commuter school. When you visited the campus, were you only shown the graduate center?",

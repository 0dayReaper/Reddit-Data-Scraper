    "postText": "I will be attending classes at City College of New York next semester and I'm excited about the opportunity to learn here. However, many of my classes will be at night, so I know I'll need coffee and/or a snack to fuel my energy. Are there reputable, great coffee places around the campus that aren't too far? Additionally, how is the coffee on campus?\n\nLastly, I like to bring my own tea bags to make hot tea when I'm in the mood. Where can I just grab a hot glass of water to brew? I'll mostly be in Shephard Hall, but do not mind going to North-Academic-Center, if necessary.",

            "comment": "My favorite coffee shop is Sugar Hill Cafe near the 145th A stop. There is also a Dunkin across the street. There are several bodegas on Amsterdam near campus with coffee and a small cafe during business hours in NAC near the entrance to the library. I think the NAC coffee is fine. Sugar Hill is my fav but it's a tidge pricier. \n\nHope this helps. I don't have any suggestions for hot water, but I would suggest trying the cafeteria which is adjacent to the cafe in the NAC.",

            "comment": "Not a fan of ccny so my opinion will probably biased. while they do have a good reputation in engineering they are very bureaucratic in terms of administration. \nYou need to be on top of college deadline i.e registration dates, financial aid dates. If you can get passed that you're already ahead of most of the students. \n\nThe bad-\n\n\nYou need to be aggressive with administration or else you won't get what you're paying for. many of the  staff don't want to help when things go south, vague information and make you go back and forth for a simple answer which can be solved with a phone call/communication with other departments\n\n School has bad history with budgeting, president stealing donation money, elevators/escalators are almost non-existent (doesn't work over 80% of the time)  crowded, lack of student Life(commuter school), campus food is horrendous has been closed about 2-3 times due to health issues. \n\nMTA\n\nThe Libraries are disgusting, has bed bugs. People use it to mess around most of the time.  Mainly the NAC. \n\nScience building and Shepard library are alright however lack of outlets, pretty cramped. \n\nRare to find a good professor. Im not sure about art professors sorry. \n\nCUNY first which is the college hub. Where you'll be using it to register, see your grades, financial aid etc, Every CUNY uses this site and it will crash and have you frustrated.\n\nPoor security. Always have your student ID with you. Theres no tap feature, no swipe. Just show the ID to the security guard and you're in. Could be anyone's ID too. \nEvery semester they put a new sticker on it indicating the term. \n\nLimited professors/classes. Seniority gets first choice then trickles down to freshman. Still first come first serve basis. \n\nGood luck trying to get seen/heard in the financial aid office. Make sure you schedule is free. You'll wait hours. \n\n\nThe good-\n\nif you're doing SEEK which is their version of EOP, very good and tons of resources (tutoring, lifetime friends, network, books, money), will seem they are babysitting you the first year. \n\n\nTypically since it's a cuny and if you qualify for student aid/Pell Grant/TAP You'll get about 1-2k back. Use it wisely. \n\n\nHas one of the best or prettiest campus exteriors(building structures) *has a campus compared to other CUNY's\n\nAcademically CCNY has good reputation the trade off is basically what's in the bad. \n\n\n\n\nOther notes: \n\nthere's a high school within campus.\n\nTheres a gym. \n\nStudents are friendly, many are activist. Don't be afraid to spark up a convo. Everyone has the same goal, to succeed. \n\nCleanest bathrooms are hidden in the very top or snuck away at the lower floors. \n\nVery diverse. \n\nI'm not too familiar with CCNY art or which art are you planning to go for? CCNY should offer digital art. \nOnce COVID resides, check out the campus, talk to administration staff.",

            "comment": "Hey I am in my last semester and I am getting my BA in Art Education (to be an art teacher) I gotta be honest with you, its been very difficult. Everything GangstaShepard said in the previous message I 100 percent agree with. Admin is pretty terrible and everything is very beautocratic, you will feel like your at the DMV. Financial aide is nasty and unhelpful. On a good note, there is one amazing art professor named Leo Fuentes who teaches painting who you can take more than one painting classes with and one great photography professor I forgot her name but the photography department is small and everyone is really nice in there. They have a really awesome darkroom. The art building was my favorite part of the school HOWEVER I had one art teacher who mistreated me and when I went to the chair of the department she was very unhelpful. The art advisor gives zero F$#$#%$% about the students. If you do go, be prepared, its not warm and fuzzy. Its a commuter school. There are no good places to eat that are affordable, there is one cute coffee shop but its overpriced. Otherwise its ripoff gentrified pizza and nasty Chinese food. CCNY is rough. I gotta give it to you straight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts cheap, so theres that. But art supplies are expensive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck. If you are determined to get a degree and you cant afford high tuition then you can do it, just know it'll be difficult.",

How are the other art supplies? Is it sufficient for a decent education? Also, how much do you think you have to spend on art supplies per semester?",

                            "comment": "Hi :) For photography I think I spent about $150 on supplies but I used them in a way where it felt worth it, for 2D design which Im pretty sure is mandatory for all art students, I cant remember exactly but it was probably somewhere between $80 to $150, painting you need to buy paints and canvases and stuff but he doesn't make you bend over backwards to buy expensive stuff. The cost of supplies felt reasonable to me bc the tuition is so low it balances out. Also I want to encourage you that even though the financial aide office is nasty, APPLY because you would be surprised, I have not spent a penny on my tuition, they offer really good aide. So I would give it a shot. Its hard to say whether it was a decent education, having to spend so much time dealing with the nasty people in the offices and having no support from advisors caused me depression and anxiety, which got in the way of being able to focus. I have constantly felt that the roof is going to collapse over me. However like I said, if your strong you can do it and most of the art professors are really good people, so maybe build connections with them. Also, some art students are really great people, very down to earth. So, its a mixed bag! I hope that helps :)",

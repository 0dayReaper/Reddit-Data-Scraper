    "postText": "Hello everyone, I'm currently in the process of applying to CCNY Grove School of Engineering as a graduate student in Computer Science. I'm planning to attend the university as a Fulbright Scholar for my semester abroad. Therefore I have to choose three courses at graduate level and I have trouble deciding. If someone here has experience in that area, please let me know, because I have a few questions regarding some courses - Thanks in advance!",

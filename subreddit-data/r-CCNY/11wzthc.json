    "postText": "Soo I applied to the GSOE in February 2023 as a transfer but I haven't completed all the prerequisites yet.\n\n1. Any transfers that also applied for Fall 2023 and got in? If so, did you complete all the prereqs?\n2. If I don't get in this semester and finish the prerequisites by next semester, if I were to apply again, what are my chances of getting in for Spring 2024?",

If you have at least a 3 you should be admitted. Idk if it\u2019s ever program but in mine you can take one course when not in the program (if that makes sense).",

    "postText": "Hello, I currently live in Long Island and was wondering if anyone would be able to share reasons to attend/not attend this school for my master's degree? Basically, can you review the college for me?\n\nIf I attend I would be commuting to the school. So if you guys can share the parking experience as well? Like is it hard to find parking on the streets? What about paying at a nearby garage?",

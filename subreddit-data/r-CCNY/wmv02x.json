A very high percentage of CUNY students never finish their degree. \n\nCan you work while being a student?  For 2.5 years, I worked full-time and carried a full-time engineering schedule.  I had no parental support and TAP, Pell grants and regular student loans came in handy.  Are you saying you are not eligible for those?",

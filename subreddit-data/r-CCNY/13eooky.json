    "postText": "Hi everyone, I am currently a Bachelor\u2019s student of CS in Tecnologico de Monterrey, located in Mexico, which is the #2 best Mexican university, top #170 globally and top #86 for cs globally. It recently came to mind transferring or just applying to certain CCNY, since I have always wanted to live in New York and I think studying in the US is a major advantage for getting a job there. \n\nMy question is, which one do you think would be a better choice? I would really like a job at FAANG, and I know that many of the cs students at my current university have had internships at FAANG and also have jobs in this companies. But I also think that studying in the US is a major advantage for getting a job there (is it not?), since I think these companies would prefer people studying in the US at a not prestigious college rather than a somewhat prestigious college in another country, which is why I was thinking of applying and going study there.\n\nWhat do you think would be the best choice for me? \n\nI should mention that my gpa isn\u2019t that good, which is why I didn\u2019t think of applying to some university more prestigious than CCNY, and that I am about to finish my first semester here.",

Living here isn't a hollywood movie. \n\nI think you have the Youtube vision of being a CS student and thinking oh I'm going to work at a FAANG and make a billion dollars and life will be great, and you're comparing yourself to your friends. Working at a FAANG isn't the end all of CS imo. I'm pretty sure most FAANGs just laid off people. Plus, companies are under scrutiny for not hiring natural born citizens.\n\nAlso most places don't really care what school that you went to unless it's like MIT and then it's just like \"oh cool\". Probably the extremely competitive places like FAANG as you intend to work for, since they need to find ways to filter people. But I know many people I graduated working at big places, including FAANG. \n\nThe grove school is not easy to get into, so I'm not even sure about your GPA. Not even sure they would consider your courses from your first semester. Plus then it's pretty difficult, a lot of people drop out. You know the cliche \"Oh only 10% of you will be here by your 4th year\", yeah pretty much. Most of the people I was with were gone by the third year. They dropped out, switched majors, etc.\n\nWhy not just do a school closer to Mexico that is in the US if anything? You're closer to home, and closer to California where a lot of big places are.",

CCNY will give you a shit network, but being a bit proactive in NYC can get you a great one. only thing CCNY has going is the affordability for the education, and this only applies to NYC residents. \n\nidk about Technologico de Monterrey but if theyre that high rated then their alum and professional network is probably just as good.",

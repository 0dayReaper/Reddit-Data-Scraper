            "comment": "It's been a while so hard to remember\n\nCpE but took a Soft Engr role (much easier to get remote work vs EE/CpE hardware related work at least as an entry)\n\nResponse rate was what apparently is good to aim for, 5-10%. Though I graduated CCNY during covid started, so the applying process the past few years is different since I declined places that wanted in person. I got a good amount asking but refused.\n\nThere's a 75 Leetcode challenge thing or something like that. But best to try and just start now so you don't have to rush through it. Honestly I felt the biggest challenging question I was able to answer due to CpE classes, not leetcode etc.\n\nIT internship. I feel if I had a cs internship I would of had a much better callback rate.\n\n2 years. Took about a year off for myself, occasionally applying and ramped a year after.",

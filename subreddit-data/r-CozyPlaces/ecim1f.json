On a summer day, you could be experiencing a cloudy day in the 70s at the beach (say, Venice), while it's 90 degrees in DTLA and a sunny and bright 108 in Chatsworth, all without leaving the actual limits of the city of LA.",

Thanks to the Cook Strait, which is effectively a giant funnel for the wind passing between the two major islands of NZ, which Wellington gets to bear the brunt of. \n\nEdit: Although average humidity is actually higher than mentioned, at just over 80%. I don't mind it though, it's a great place besides that. As we say here, *you can't beat Wellington on a good day.*",

Maybe rotate those lights so they'd fall inwards instead when someone like myself inevitably knocks them off because I've had too much to drink which is something that would definitely 100% happen were I in this environment.

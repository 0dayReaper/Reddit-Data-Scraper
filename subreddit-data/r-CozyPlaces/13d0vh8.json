I slept in the living room sometimes if it was really hot. It was a  very old house and when we tried to run an AC upstairs it would blow a fuse. This was back in the 90s so I could usually get by with a window fan and a fan on me unless it got really hot and then I would sleep in the living room. I feel like now we have longer heat waves and higher temps I would have been sleeping in the living room most of the time.",

We put a thermometer in there year round cuz we were curious\u2026the attic was 120-130 degrees most of the time and during the summer could push 140 . Totally crazy",

Can tell you are clearly happily married.\n\n\nWell, maybe you didn't learn this in law school (or apparently your social life, or lack there of...), but different people need different things. Maybe, just maybe, I know my wife better than you, and pretty sure she knows what she needs better than you too. She works full-time as a senior paralegal (going on 8 years now) while attending law school (5 part time semesters down already) and is very much in control of her study and focus but definitely needs and appreciates the little thoughtful things to help her balance her stress. \n\n\nShe has all A's and one B so far, has had her law review submission published, is on the law review board, and will be starting an internship at one of the largest firms in the US shortly. Her current firm is letting her take the internship and holding her position open for her and has bent over backward over the years to meet her schedule because of how much they know she is worth.\n\n\nSo maybe while you need to 100% focus, lock the door and shut out the world (which is fine since as I previously mentioned different people need different things), she seems to be doing just fine with the system we have going. So don't come in here telling me how to act with my \"stupid shit like a pillow fort\" since my pillow fort doesn't seem to be the \"stupid shit\" in this comment thread. \n\n\nYou must be fun at parties...",

A bedsit is a downgrade from a shared house, basically.\n\nA studio flat has a kitchen and bathroom and is an upgrade from a shared house. For example a friend of mine is a white collar businessperson in her 30s earning a good-average living. With the help of a couple hundred pounds a month from her father she has been able to afford to move out of a shared house into a studio flat. A bedsit is what she would move into if she could no longer work and had to rely on the state.",

By attaching it to the wall, I'd think you'd be introducing hard points which could resist the movement in the wrong places and lead to the bed breaking. Furniture like a bookcase which shouldn't move around much can be fixed to a wall, but it seems a bed would basically suffer fatigue failure eventually. \n\nAs I said, it's not remotely my realm of knowledge but this is vaguely based on memoriesof a lecture on stress considerations for mounting hydraulic system components on aircraft, which is more or less the same, right?",

You hold their gaze for just a moment longer than you normally would. Then return their gesture with an understated nod. You both know you\u2019ll miss each other, but you both know it was time for England to leave. You notice a single tear drip down the captains cheek. You reach for the controls, but... no. It\u2019s too late to turn back now. What\u2019s done is done. After all, if you turn back now all of those buses will have gone to waste.\n\nThe French turn their vessel back toward mainland Europe. Pretending not to notice the massive, proud isle slipping away into the Atlantic, casually dragging a very upset Scotland with it. The captain can\u2019t help himself. He grabs his spyglass to take one last look at Britain. He lets out a small chuckle as the island rolls right over Ireland, hardly slowing. Ah yes, some things never change do they?",

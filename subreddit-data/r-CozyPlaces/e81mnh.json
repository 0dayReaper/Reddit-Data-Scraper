Like OP\u2019s image was somehow made physical from an emotion or idea that I have in my head. \n\nBasically a bastardized form of Plato\u2019s theory of forms. \n\n\nTLDR; the picture is lovely, Christmas is lovely, and this picture is lovely in the same way that I envision the truest essence of Christmas to be.",

The cabinet has a large size (what you see in this photo), a smaller end table, a TV stand, and a bench that all match. I believe the couch was like $399 and the cabinet was $50 when I bought them a few years ago. The sofa has lasted for years and is very comfortable and good quality. It is from \u201cLane\u201d. Check out big lots if you can!!",

Even getting a little pollen on their nose when sniffing it, then licking it off is enough to cause kidney failure.\n\nSunflowers, roses, orchids, freesias, gerberas, stocks, zinnias, asters, wax flowers are among those that are safe. There's also a lot of cute folliage indoor plants like peperomias, calathias, and marantas that are safe for cats. But it sucks that some of the very cutest things are so toxic :(",

You\u2019ve really picked some nice pieces. \n\nReminds me of my favorite apartment ever (aside from the parking), it looked almost exactly like yours and had incredible light and a gorgeous orange tree outside. Then the owners cut the tree down. I was so sad!! But still miss that place. It had so much character and was really fun to create new layouts to experiment with the space. \n\nYears later I had a one bedroom in another city that was technically much bigger than that studio but FELT so much smaller due to walls and layout. Crazy that my tiny studio apartment felt so huge comparatively.",

Your furniture choices fit the original parts seamlessly. Your cute little storage and organization pieces keep everything tidy but lived in (nothing worse than tidy=empty and lifeless). The natural shades of white in your pieces make the white walls feel organic and part of the aesthetic (as opposed to a blank background that can't be integrated? I'm not sure how to articulate this thought, sorry). The washed-out colors in the details and the big rug make it feel both crisp and clean like linens on a clothesline on a coast somewhere and cozy like your favorite fades sleeping shirt. As another commenter said, the character in the older building makes it all so much cooler than more modern cookie-cutter houses and apartments; the vintage feel subtly suggests turn-of-the-century farmhouse or New England beachhouse. The gold/brass details add the hint of 80's luxury. And the cats bring everything together.\n\nSorry for the big rambling block of text. I just wanted to accurately articulate my thoughts on your lovely home because you put a lot of thought into your design and deserve to know how nice it is.\n\nI would love to sip a Moscato here and nibble snacks for a casual game night or some such.",

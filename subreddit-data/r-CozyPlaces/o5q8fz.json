This year I got a quote, but it was a lot of money. The problem is the eave hangs out pretty far, and it's a \\~20 foot drop off of that deck, so its hard to set a ladder up against it.",

And just practice on a lower window until you don\u2019t leave streaks (it doesn\u2019t take very long to get the hang of it). For a cleaning solution I use \u201cThe Pill\u201d by Unger. It works really well. If you don\u2019t like ladders you can get an extension pole but the edges don\u2019t come as clean since you aren\u2019t face to face with it to wipe it down with a towel when you\u2019re done. If you want more quotes I\u2019d recommend checking out Angies List. I\u2019ve advertised there in the past and it\u2019s a good way to see reviews (and you typically go through a background check before you\u2019re allowed to be on there, so that\u2019s a plus). You basically have a 50/50 shot of getting someone out there that won\u2019t price gouge you because you have big windows with a view. Some will give you an honest price and others will bump the price way up because of the mentality that if you have big windows then you must have a big wallet.",

And she has also slept through the night 11-12hrs straight since 6mo so we don\u2019t have to destroy our relationship to visit her in the night \ud83d\ude02 \n\nNo but seriously, having to tend to your baby in the middle of the night does nothing to destroy your relationship with anyone so idk what you\u2019re talking about",

I am a bit concerned about the rug, try to avoid them as they can a hazard : tripping over them is a nightmare of mine, unless you find a way to secure them tightly to the floor. Talking about floors, yours are really nice and give a warmer touch. I would show them more , they are also easy to clean and get rid of the rug that attracts more dust.

Surely a magical sign.\n\nIf it's not breaking the rules -- and certainly not if you'd prefer not to say -- can you give us an idea of where in the world this is? I feel the strongest need to add it to my list of future dream-places to visit (or move to.)\n\nSomeone else mentioned the rightness of the pink details out front. This is one of my favorite colors, something remembered from a house I used to visit as a kid, and which I painted my (tiny, microscopic really, apartment) entryway, except the color was called \"Frankincense.\" A sort of very appealing dusty pink which I love and which brought back such good vibes when I saw it. Anyway, just wonderful.",

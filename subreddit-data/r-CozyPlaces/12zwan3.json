The skylights are beautiful. You can get shades for those. \n\nCurtains in a bathroom can be problematic. \n\nMaybe cling privacy film? One piece shutter? Which might get in the way..\n\nI do recommend applying Rain-x to the glass shower door. It\u2019s fabulous for controlling Esther spots. As for cleaning, use a loofah once a month or so. It removes soap residue and the stuff that comes off of us (dead skin etc)\n\nEnjoy!",

We removed the cast iron tub/tile shower, removed walls. Created a closet, added skylights, rebuilt a shower with a bench seat, replaced entirely the cabinets, sink, and countertop... As well as new appliances.\n\nProject has taken almost a year to complete (we both work FT jobs and didn't outsource a thing). Pretty happy with where we're at so far!\n\nETA that I picked the WORST initial photo. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

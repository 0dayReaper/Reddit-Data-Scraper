Plus, being in the heart of downtown means there's plenty to explore and experience right at your doorstep. I'll definitely have to consider Sweet Pea's for my next trip to the area.",

It's been so nice meeting other travellers in the community kitchen and everyone has been very respectful during quiet hours. Parking is tricky but once that's done, everything downtown is walkable.",

Amazing place to use as a base camp to explore the surrounding towns and nature trails. I'm not a big drinker but if you like beer there are about 40 breweries in the area. Lots of art, music, yoga/dance and alternative medicine offerings to explore as well.",

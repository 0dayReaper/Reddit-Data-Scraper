I'm also a photographer and enjoy doing my edits here.\nReally though I like having a bench where just about anything can be accomplished as fast as my brain can process it. It's why I keep so many of my common tools within arms reach. I can mark and measure something, make cuts, glue and screw/nail/solder it all together in a matter of minutes.",

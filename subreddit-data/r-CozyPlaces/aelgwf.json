I got the same cabin on our anniversary and spread her ashes in the ocean behind it. This was our cozy place.",

I just want to say that we\u2019re all so much stronger than we think or give ourselves credit for.  As much as I appreciate the sentiments, I\u2019m not special in this way or stronger than anyone else.  You\u2019re just as strong and just as valuable as any other person or thing.  Honestly, if it wasn\u2019t for Love I wouldn\u2019t have had the strength to do what I did and that\u2019s a fact.  My love for my wife gave me the strength to try to do what I thought was right or the best I could in taking care of her.  I\u2019m sure if the unfortunate time came, you would do the same or better.  Wherever you are and however you feel, my heart goes out to you Friends.  Just know you\u2019re worth it too.",

The thing is though that it does eventually get better, I can promise you that. You'll never forget them, and thinking about them will always have a tinge of sadness - but the pain won't be as raw, immediate and debilitating as it is now.\n\nMy father died unexpectedly when he was 52 years old, and I was in my teens. It completely shattered my family, but little by little you work your way back to normality. Things are never the same again, your life will always be different, but it can still be *good*.\n\nAfter my father died I often found myself thinking of the times I'd been a little shit, or said and done hurtful things. Normal teenage stuff, but it weighs on you after someone is gone and you can't say, \"I'm sorry\".\n\nIt was only many years later, after I became a parent myself, that I learned to let this go. Even when your kids say or do something that hurts you, you still love them with every fiber of your being. There's nothing that needs forgiveness; it was forgiven as soon as it happened.",

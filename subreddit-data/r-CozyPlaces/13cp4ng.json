Gorgeous color but it doesn't reflect any light so with lights on it still is more of a candle light feel. Before we moved in it was white walls and bottom half wall paper but definitely much brighter. I like candle light ambience but at the same time sometimes I need more light lol. I may have chosen the wrong color for the lighting we have. Even though there are 5 windows in our combined family/dining/kitchen plus the deck door. Open floor plan",

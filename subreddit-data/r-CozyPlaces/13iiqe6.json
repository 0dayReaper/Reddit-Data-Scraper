We love hanging there. I even bought  small electric power washer to wash off the grime. We have to stain the deck and porch every year. Do you as well? The sun here is gnarly. \n\nI\u2019ve considered having a fan installed on the porch. There\u2019s s power outlet out there, so it shouldn\u2019t be too tough to do? Other than the pitch being 12\u2019-15\u2019. \n\nEnjoy your spring/summer. I wonder if we are distant neighbors lol",

That looks like it was a blast to design/build (except for the folks who couldn\u2019t provide *constructive* criticism). \n\nGood on you for not deleting Reddit and going into hiding! And especially good on you for being humble enough to take some of the good advice given. Looks like a fun spot!",

Cutting into the floor board could easily ruin the structural support of the floor, the box is pretty close to the door which could inhibit proper code for rights of egress, ladders (can) be used in private homes in some cases but it's a case to case basis (usually stairs have to follow a specified incline maximum), the fact that the stairs end directly at a wall, etc. As others mentioned there's another door to get in, but in the case of an emergency a \"secret\" entrance is usually a pretty bad idea. \n\nIf you find the original thread a lot of people tear into it.

I fully admit to being an amateur (hence posting to r/DIY) and it was pointed out that the type of wood used to make the sides (melamine) and holding it together with screws wasn't a great solution. It was suggested to build an internal frame which would be the structural component of the seat and the melamine would become just a decorative skin. \n\n&gt;The other complaint was that if the lid broke, the person sitting on it would fall straight down the hole. While the chances of the lid breaking in such a way to allow it to do that were highly unlikely in my opinion, I recognized people's concerns and decided to bring back the cutout floorboards to make a trapdoor for the extra layer of safety.",

Which he fixed and posted in this https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5tfcb5/update_heres_the_updates_to_the_secret/?utm_source=reddit-android thread.\n\n\nNow everyone seems to confuse it with the burried shipping container bunker as dug up in this\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CozyPlaces/comments/8x1tfa/netflix_bunker/e20f8ms?utm_source=reddit-android comment.\n\n\nThey are two very different diy's.

Not to mention plastic everywhere, not thrilled about cheap plastic in contact with boiling water that I intend to drink. Lasted me about a month and a half before I upgraded. Probably drank a bunch of lead and chemicals in that time. Skip that step if possible, just get a decent machine to start with.\n\nAlso get a good grinder, almost as big a difference as the machine itself going from pre-ground to grinding at home.",

If you go much cheaper than that, you may not get good reliability or even be able to grind fine enough.\n\nI know that espresso people get snobby about equipment, some will tell you that you need to spend $1500 to get a first setup, or even more.   I don't think you have to spend that much, but, you probably can't get something you'll be really happy with for less than $400-600 minimum, for grinder and machine.",

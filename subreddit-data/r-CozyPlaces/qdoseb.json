Some practical side of me googled the situation and found the Starlink tracker which showed it appearing at exactly that time in my area. Was an intense couple of minutes tho and I even left a funny ass voicemail on my friends answering machine wondering if he saw same thing too since I just left his house.",

Idk) because her mom fell and was unconscious. Some of the docs ended up talking this kid through cutting into her mom and sticking a straw into her collapsed lung and giving CPR, while they say Staying Alive to help the girl keep the rhythm. Emergency services finally got to their cabin and brought them in. The little girl was played by Millie Bobby Brown. \n\nCan't imagine having to do that as an adult let as a kid, or my own kid having to do it. I know that was just a tv show, but still. No, thank you.",

Don't remember what it was called but it was the most ludicrous bullshit.\n\nLike, in one episode, a woman's child was on a ventilator at home but there was a city wide power outage. As the backup battery died, she had to manually bag her child as she called 911.\n\nThe 911 operator had an epiphany  and pulled some NCIS Abby shit and used satellite mapping to find out a neighbor a few houses down had solar panels with a battery reserve.\n\nSo she calls this person and she agrees to supply power for the child. Wonderful, who wouldn't right?\n\nInstead of wheeling the kid over to solar panel lady's house temporarily, she calls all her neighbors and there's a montage of them connecting all their extension cords together to reach this kid's home.\n\nNot only is this probably a major hazard, but as it turns out they're *just* short on extension cabling but solar panel lady has a moment of triumph and says \"no we're not\" as she pulls out a string of christmas lights.\n\nNow Christmas lights are the shittiest thin ass wire they can get away with so they can sell them for less than dirt. When volts drop, amperage increases as a device needs to draw the same amount of watts. You're gonna get significant voltage drop over several houses worth of ordinary 2 prong extension cords.\n\nPresumably in reality, the ventilator would pop the fuses in the shitty christmas lights immediately and child would be breathing no longer.\n\nEven without the christmas lights, the lowered voltage could damage the ventilator (which probably has a grounded 3 prong plug and wouldn't be able to plug into either the christmas lights or 2 prong extension cords anyway), and they could potentially start an electrical fire.",

It's a tad pricer to get into, but cheaper to maintain than the more popular repellents..... all of which I tried.  Then doubled.  You have to run by a local welding store and get a bottle of co2, and their included regulator releases on the high side, but its ultra trivial to setup.\n\nLove the area - only posting because after building my pool entertainment area up, we never used it til fixing the mosquito issue!",

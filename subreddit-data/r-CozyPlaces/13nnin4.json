I've slept in studio apartments but never had a designated space to myself. I wanted it to reflect me and my needs, so I've filled it with happy things. \n\nA lot of people asked about the wall colour and the bedding - the wall colour is Vardo by Farrow and Ball (the only brand I'm not allergic to) and the bedding was an end of sale buy from Wilkos a few years ago, but Google boho bedding and you can find similar \ud83d\ude09 \n\nI was also able to include the transformation pictures this time. This began as one HUGE room we divided into 2, a hallway and a (eventual) reading nook. It's been a huge renovation but it's nearly done!",

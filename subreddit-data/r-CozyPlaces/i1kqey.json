The box was filled within 2 weeks and the projects were left on the tiny table 24/7 to the point where it would take her an hour of work to clean it up to collapse it again. Her new solution was to have him make her an entire craft room so that the box could be permanently open and she could have a nice big table to do crafts along with a dedicated tv to have on in the background. 1 year later the room was no longer used except for storage of her craft supplies. \n\nThe product in this post will not make the person all of the sudden very organized. It would be perfect for a person that is already organized.",

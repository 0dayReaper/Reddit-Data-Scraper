We did get lots of snow (by UK standards) in 2018, however. Before that, I think 2015 or 2016 was the last time we'd had enough snow for it to gather on the ground. \n\nNorthern England and Scotland might've gotten more in those years.",

The easiest Narcissus bulbs to flower are the paperwhite varieties, as there\u2019s less fuss getting them to bloom. They\u2019re quite lovely and have a very fragrant smell!!! I highly recommend the practice of forcing blooms\u2014it brightens the darkest winter days with a glimpse of spring to come.\n\nEdit: zoomed in on the picture and the bulbs in pic are definitely hyacinth bulbs!",

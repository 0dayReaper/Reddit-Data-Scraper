It sits on a farm located on the side of a mountain in British Columbia. I'm surrounded by vegetation and wildlife and the city is close enough for me to make a living.\n\nEdit; I have my brother-in-law, sister and my niece and nephew (10 and 5) visiting from Ontario right now so, needless to say, I have my hands full and I'm sorry if I don't reply to every comment. Thank you for everyone's comments though. I appreciate all of it. :)",

I mainly use the propane heater that runs off of my 100ibs propane tank which only costs me about $100 to fill every 12 days give or take in the coldest of seasons. I've skirted the entire outside with osb, roxal and polly. It's actually the most cozy in the winter if I'm going to be honest:p Also the trailer itself was originally sold with a winter package that included insulated walls, insulated(spray foamed) floor and a thick one-piece rubber roof. I was worried about heating as well before I spent my first winter in it but it was a breeze.",

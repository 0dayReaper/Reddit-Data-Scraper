It's cheaper than a meal you would get in a restaurant with table service, but it's more expensive than other fast food. To give you a point of comparison, a regular hamburger or cheeseburger at McDonald's costs \u20ac1. Grill kiosks and late-night food carts tend to charge higher prices because there are not so many places open at that time of night, and the majority of their customers are too drunk to notice or care that they're paying higher prices.",

I've never been to the most popular Albanian restaurant but I've been to many less popular restaurants and the food is amazing and cheap.  \n\nYou can get a 16 oz bottle of Albanian beer (my preferred choice is Kor\u00e7a) for no more that 200lek at a restaurant.  I went to a bar in Berat at got a liter bottle of Kor\u00e7a for 150 Lek.  I could've had 4 of those for less than the cost of a pint of beer at a bar in the United States.  \n\nAlbania isn't the scary place people think it is. It's safe and beautiful and the people are kind and hospitable.  Y'all don't know what you're missing!",

Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina has been a peaceful country for more than 20 years now, with a bustling tourist industry. Kosovo is an amazing place where personal security is rarely a concern, as much of a concern as in many other European countries. Despite their troubled past, the Balkan countries are nowadays peaceful and prospering in many areas, especially tourism. \n\nIf you ever come to Albania I would very strongly suggest you rent a car and take a tour of specifically Kosovo and Bosnia and see how the world view constructed by the media and entertainment industry about these countries has nothing in common with the real situation. These are hospitable, safe and gorgeous countries to visit. The stigma built by the media about our region is a real thorn in our back and everyone that has visited us can atest that what you are shown on TV is worlds apart from what you will experience in reality.",

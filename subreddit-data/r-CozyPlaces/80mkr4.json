See places like: \u00c5lesund and Geiranger. Just search for M\u00f8re og Romsdal.\n\nEdit: Lofoten is also extremely nice, however, it is far north and it will cost you some to get there. Going to M\u00f8re and Romsdal, you\u2019ll be able to see a lot more than only one place. Seeing that it is a lot more central to other sights and places, relatively speaking. ",

Period. Not much else. Farmland. But the nature *is* amazing, there's no denying that.\n\n- Go to M&amp;R if you want fjords and varied, dramatic nature, a couple of great cities (like \u00c5lesund - Google it!), and some super scenic roads on the ocean.\n\n... or just do what I recommend anyone going to Norway: Do both. Rent a car in Bergen and drive North along the coast until you reach Trondheim. Your camera will be begging for mercy.",

Just don't go out for a drink expecting to get drunk and still have any money left by the end of the night. There's a reason we drink at home, then run out for one last beer right before closing time. The current \"normal\" price for 0.5 l of completely ordinary lager in Oslo is $11.",

The people are super friendly, we hung out with some locals in Oslo.  Found some amazing hikes and over all, it was very easy to get around. We loved it. \n\nSome down sides are. It\u2019s not cheap and in my experience, the food...isn\u2019t that great. Sure I had some good meals, but over all, eh.  Also the booze is pretty pricey. \n\nFinally, I don\u2019t enjoy doing the usual tourist stuff but I highly recommend going to flam, taking the train up and then biking your way back. It was amazing!  You stop at a goat farm, the views are awesome on both ways. We stopped by a very old church and the ride back is long but pretty easy.  When you get back to town they have this dope brewery that looks like a old Viking hut. And the beer there was the best I had on the whole trip. \n\nBut you need to reserve your bikes like a month in advance. Don\u2019t just show up thinking you can grab a bike. I saw a lot of sad tourists with that mindset. \n\nBut, pretty much you see views like this picture everywhere you go. ",

Have ever been to Yosemite? Or seen pictures of El Capitan (it's the large granite sheer cliff that climbers like to climb on)?Ok, now imagine driving through El Capitan. And now imagine Yosemite is the size of California. That's Norway. # 2) do you speak English? Because if you do, they do too! It's not like France where nary a word of English is found. You can talk to the locals, ask directions, order food, etc in English. And weirdly enough, it's California English. And they are friendly! By the way. I do love France, but no matter how hard I try, my French is just horrible and you really need to speak French to get around. \n\nSo get that plane ticket, rent that car, and go! \n\nNow!\n\nWhat are you waiting for?

For cities, I'd recommend Bergen, which is in reasonable driving distance from Voss, Flor\u00f8 and Hardanger, all of which are gorgeous. Bergen also has a pretty decent food and culture scene.\n\nGenerally, rent a car and make sure to have plenty of time. You'll be driving for a reasonable bit of time if you come, but the drives are just as scenic as the destinations.",

Cross country skiing is one of the best ways to experience nature.\n\nThe fjords however are best in summer IMO. M\u00f8re og Romsdal has some of the most stunning landscapes, and it is particularly in summer the beauty really shows. And part of it, a steep road called Trollstigen (the Troll Ladder), is only accessible in summer.",

I'm an avid outdoorsman in my free time and I've always been captivated by nature, so my office is pretty much a mini natural history museum. I have a bunch of fossils and minerals on a display shelf on the opposite wall. I'm also working on adding a few reptile and amphibian prints into the mix.   \n    \nGood eye on spotting the fly tying vise. The feather thief is one of my favorite books. I usually do a bunch of solo backpacking trips in the Sierra during the summer and fall. It's going to be amazing back there this year with all the water from the snow melt.",

Potential candidates are a Gila Monster, a horned lizard, rattle snake, rough skinned newt, tiger salamander. Those ones would need to come from different artists though and have been a bit harder to track down.",

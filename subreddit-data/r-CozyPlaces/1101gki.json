The sheer scale of some are truly amazing. Plus it\u2019s free (but you need to reserve tickets, which can also be done on the spot in a pinch), so it\u2019s a great visit if you\u2019re already at York.        \n\nThe art museum got some real Picasso works.      \nEdit: Hangar* obviously, although a hanger holding some model trains do sound quite hilarious.",

Amazing Viking history, down by the museum gardens used to be a key trading port. Speaking of flooding, the Kings Arms down by the river is a fun pub to go to because it gets flooded every year and they mark on the walls the heights of the floods. Also Rowntree park is another omission of mine, whoopsie.",

Also on The Shambles are our famous ghost merchants, a tiny shop where you choose a little ghost model which have become very famous. If it is still the same process for choosing, it gets delivered to you accross the shop on a tiny model railway! Same street has many other shops including another branch of this excellent loose leaf tea shop where you can choose from hundreds of flavours. Best to get to all early in the day, to avoid crowds.",

The street is narrow, with many timber-framed buildings with jettied floors that overhang the street by several feet. It was once known as The Great Flesh Shambles, probably from the Anglo-Saxon Fleshammels (literally flesh-shelves), the word for the shelves that butchers used to display their meat. In 1885, thirty-one butchers' shops were located along the street, but now none remain.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/CozyPlaces/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

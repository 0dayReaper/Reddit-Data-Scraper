Living closer to the center can mean that you're in a more \"fun\" location with more opportunities for social activities.  As you get further out, the tube and train lines get further apart and there are more dead zones where it gets harder to commute into the center quickly.  Some of these are still perfectly nice because not everyone works in the middle.  And even further out there are areas with a lot of local character that are still well-connected.\n\nI've lived in various parts of London for the last 30 years.  When I was younger, I was closer to the middle because I did more stuff and wanted to be able to stagger home from the last tube or easily get a night bus home.  With a family, I now live further out but it doesn't take me that much longer to get to work.",

Not that it's better or worse as a whole, but its spiral districting makes it kinda evenly distributed for things to do/proximity to Metro/RER. Puts a little less pressure on where to live. That and the size/population of course.",

I adore London and living here is 100% a lifestyle choice. My partner and I have priorities that are probably not the most typical of people our age (40s). We don\u2019t have or intend to have kids, go out reasonably frequently in the evenings (about 3 nights a week - sometimes for social, sometimes for work), and in the day on weekends. I like being able to walk home in 15-20 mins after a night out and feel safe, and in the morning walk to a nice cafe for brunch or hop on a bus and be somewhere like the South Bank in 20 minutes. I like having shops nearby that I can nosey around in, and I\u2019ve come to know most of the local business owners quite well (contrary to popular belief, it is possible to get to know your neighbours in a big city). I cycle to work and can get from one end of Zone 2 to the other within 45 minutes. We both can drive, but don\u2019t own a car.\n\nAdmittedly, I would love to have the space we could get if we moved to zone 5 or further and the commute *in* wouldn\u2019t bother me. But I often come home late on my own, and that\u2019s where living further out would pose issues. Getting home post 10pm as a lone female is not fun, at least in the places I\u2019ve lived further out (zone 3/4). That 15-20 min walk from the station is a lot more desolate and intimidating when it\u2019s through long stretches of dark suburban streets.\n\nAside from that, I would miss that villagey feel I get where I am now. I like not having to own a car, which I think would be a necessity in most places Z5 and beyond.",

Easy access to practically limitless amenities is worth a premium for people like me. The difference between living 'downtown' and in the inner suburbs, even with the benefit of pubic transport, is considerable. My life is lived simply and locally. I walk to work, walk for groceries, and walk or take a short ride on the bus/streetcar to always-new-and-interesting entertainment. For some people, extra space isn't worth the loss of that lifestyle. Living in a downtown apartment just forces you to know and commit to what you really want for your home.",

(Which proves useful when navigating your way to a light rail station while half in the bag with a dead cell phone during a snowstorm.)\n\nCheers.",

If it's $20, 000 worth, then you owe $8,000 or whatever tax is. $8,000 is 40%, which is probably a good estimate, since you also have to pay the full 16% social security tax yourself. Plus penalties and interest, which can suck.\n\n\n\nNot saying you'll get caught, or that what you have is worth $20,000. That's beside the point. Which is that free shit is still income.",

My parents have the same, or at least very similar lounge corner in the garden and its super comfy.

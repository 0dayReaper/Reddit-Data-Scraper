I chose these 3 big city locations since OP\u2019s house is on a valley-like high rise in an expensive neighborhood. \n\nThose largest forest fires ended in 2018, and ever since California has been out of a drought, the quality of air has naturally increased. \n\nMaybe you\u2019re just jealous of the gorgeous view OP gets to enjoy everyday in excellent ~75 F California weather.

Just because it\u2019s not bad now doesn\u2019t mean the average days of unhealthy AQ still don\u2019t add up. I love CA but would never live in some parts because of it.

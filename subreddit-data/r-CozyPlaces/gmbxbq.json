I don't think I've seen a single roach in the Maryland, Virginia, DC, or Rhode Island and that accounts for about 24 years of my life.  However, I've seen a few in Vegas and they are all fucking over in Hawaii.  \n\nEveryone has them in Hawaii, even the cleanest houses do.  You'd see swarms of them in my grass outside at night if you went out with a flashlight.  Seriously, they're everywhere and you can't get rid of them in Hawaii.  The Netherlands is even colder than Maryland (where I live now), so your experience fits with my experience for the most part.  The thing about America is that it's way more south than Europe, with Mediterranean cities lining up with our northern cities, so roaches will be a more American phenomenon just based on that.",

Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age of 12 I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum, it's breathtaking, I suggest you try it.",

The small container means there is no ground to protect roots from the cold, and the wind will make it cold even if they don't get snowed on directly (which they might not - my balcony in Toronto rarely gets snowed on).\n\nI also live in TO and I'd like to have this kind of setup but I've looked around and for plants that will survive this, you need to pick zone 1-2, ie, tundra-compatible. Basically something that can live in a crack in a rock exposed to the elements (which is what this balcony is).",

Pigeons are a bit of an issue for me and also I have dust and debris coming from a condo being built across the street.\nDespite all of that, we cleared out all of the junk on our balcony and added some cozy plants, chairs and decor. It's still a work in progress but I'm quite happy with it!!",

That being said, it has not been through its first downpour. So the jury is still out.\n\nIt is doable, but you have to make your own adjustments. Good luck!",

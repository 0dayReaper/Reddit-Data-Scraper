Brilliant performance!\" I remember he took it as it was meant, a stupid little joke -- He laughed actually quietly said \"Thanks for not saying a generic *'I'm your biggest fan!'*\" I smiled, nodded, and grabbed my drink order, heading back to my table.\n\nI think maybe 10 seconds later I heard someone almost scream *\"OH MY GAWD! I'm your biggest fan!!!\"* Always wished I'd looked to see his facial expression.\n\nI haven't thought about this in years, and your comment listing Outbreak brought it flooding back; I needed a smile today, thank you!",

That movie might have the best cast of any so-bad-it's-good disaster movie.

My oldest daughter (she is 20 now), and I have probably seen it 5-6 times now.\n\nDisaster movies are great fun, awesome for bonding with the kids. \n\nAnd our latest binge now is the Fast &amp; Furious movies.

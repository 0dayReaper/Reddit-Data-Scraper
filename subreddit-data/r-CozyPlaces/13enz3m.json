Nothing major, but it certainly didn\u2019t do much for her confidence, n I always just thought, why dad?! You don\u2019t even really care about the decor, so let her have this \ud83d\ude44",

While I do love my wife's work and respect her taste and her eye for being uniquely her...it's not my style. And the difference from your father is that I do care about decor. So some 15 years ago, we decided to assign rooms to each other. We each had our own room that we shared in the house, but it was ours to decorate, and the other had no say in it whatsoever. If you look at the image I posted a couple of days ago, you'll see my [room.](https://old.reddit.com/r/CozyPlaces/comments/13du6hr/its_taken_me_a_minute_but_i_think_ive_finally/) I am standing basically in the same place, but rotated almost 90 degrees. I'm so happy we have two very different, yet cozy rooms next to each other we get to enjoy.",

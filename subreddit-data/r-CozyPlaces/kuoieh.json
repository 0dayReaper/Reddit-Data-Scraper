Sadly their search algorithm is heavily based on colors from companies, and not just a generalized color search. Some of their hex code searching also seems a bit bugged, as in I'll search a hex but it'll come back with no results. But once you do find a color, what they provide in relation to that color can't be beat. \n\nI just wish whoever owns encycolorpedia would overhaul their database to include the full hex range and have a lot more generalized colors and not just colors from various companies. Using it for digital art is rough when what you're searching for only comes up with three results from paint companies, and not colors related to the actual keyword you're looking for; violet, and iirc mauve, are two of the better examples I've ran into. It'd also be nice if they included a random palette generator, I know the homepage provides a palette, but I don't want to refresh it a hundred times just to randomly come across one palette I like.",

So building code states to be a bedroom it must be at least 70 square feet (not smaller than 7 feet in one direction), have 7 feet or higher ceilings, and have two escapable egresses in the event of a fire, usually the door and a window.  The window dimensions usually have to allow a fireman to pass through: For determining egress window sizes and placement, the International Building Code holds that every bedroom must contain at least one egress window. It must be at least 5.7 square feet, that is at least 20 inches wide by 24 inches high, with an opening no higher than 44 inches from the floor.  I\u2019m going to say that tiny window does not qualify.\n\nhttp://sacramentoappraisalblog.com/2014/09/09/the-4-requirements-for-a-room-to-be-considered-a-bedroom/",

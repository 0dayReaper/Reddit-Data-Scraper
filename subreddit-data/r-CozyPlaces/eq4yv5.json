If this is your first time watching Star Trek, a lot of people are put off by the first few episodes of The Original Series (TOS). If you don't enjoy The Cage, I recommend watching Deep Space 9 (DS9) or The Next Generation (TNG) first. If you really want to watch TOS, then episodes like \"The Balance of Terror\", \"The City on the Edge of Forever\", \"Space Seed\", and \"The Trouble With Tribbles\" are some of the best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhatever the case, you're always welcome to check out r/StarTrek !",

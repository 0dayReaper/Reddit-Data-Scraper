            "comment": "Depression can be manageable the smaller the space you live in, and the less clutter you have. I'm one of the lucky few. I get about a weeks notice that it's creeping up on me. I spend one day cleaning every inch of my place. Laundry and bills another day. Get my meds refilled and food stocked up. All those things, If they are not done before the storm hits, will make the episode much worse. A late notice will feel like the world is ending. No food will make me feel like I'm all alone and no one cares about me. \n\nSo, I take care of my shit before the deepest part of my depression reaches its apex. \n\nOne of the best things I've done to deal with my depression where episodes don't last as long, is moving into a tiny apartment. I love it. The less space and stuff I have to worry about, the better off I am. ",

Until the walls start closing in... and that artificial contentedness starts to peel away, revealing horrified panic. Disorganized, rapid fire, urgent pleas to yourself to avert disaster. Or worse, periodic waves of 'I'm completely fucked.' That's when you're in too deep over your head and you definitely need a professional and some meds.\n\nA word of caution about the mental health treatment world though. They can over diagnose, over treat, and contribute to you being overly dependent. Like in any job, there are people just going through the motions to get a paycheck in there, and there are people who are truly passionate and dedicated to helping you. Find someone who feels like they give a shit about you, and make sure you know what you're getting into with meds. And be aware that you will be giving up security clearance privileges for at least an entire year if you seek treatment. Just an FYI.",

I felt the same, the total inability of getting up do actually do something. It took me over a decade trying to cure my depression and in the end it turned out to be inattentive ADHD (or ADD as it was known).\n\nI never read up on ADHD because I wasn't hyper and only knew that stereotype. ADHD is weird in that it's both over and under-diagnosed (especially the non stereotypical type).\n\nSo for people in here who feel like it's really hard to flip the switch to get up and do something (especially without a deadline) and might feel more upset with themselves about 'being lazy/not able to adult' instead of truly depressed. You might want to read a little more about [ADHD in adults](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/add-adhd/adhd-attention-deficit-disorder-in-adults.htm) to see if you recognize yourself.\n\nIt's not that I *want* people to all have ADHD, but in hindsight I lost over a decade of my life not knowing what was wrong/being misdiagnosed and after years of mindfulness and CBT, the thing that had instant success was actually treating the ADHD.

They call it *The New System/Paradise Everlasting*. I was taught to never invest in this *current system of things*, other than preaching. No higher education. No marriage. No retirement. No savings. Nothing. \n\nThis really affected me, being raised to distrust anyone that wasn't JW. I got out really young. I hated that it labled my friends at school as *satan's workers*, meant only to misguide me. I refused to believe they were born only for that purpose.  But, the damage was done. For years and years I invested in myself just enough to get by. I entered college at 40, got a degree in nursing, and pretty much faced that music. So  many years wasted. \n\nI guess my point is, it may not be your fault. Maybe address whatever message is stuck in your head. \n\n*spelling",

One time I was thinking, and I realized I couldn't even imagine being happy. That's when I realized how bad I'd gotten. \n\nThe only real way to lessen or escape the cycle is to force yourself to do stuff. I honestly enjoyed class and work, but I wouldn't make myself go, would just spend the day playing games instead. \n\nJust because you don't feel the emotions, doesn't mean you don't suffer from them though. Signs of anxiety (for me it was random pinpricks) and stress just accumulate and make it harder and harder to make yourself do stuff.\n\nOne decision that really helped me, I went to a trucking school (free but you have to drive for them for a year). Its relatively easy to go to work when its literally just get out of bed. When you first start out you have a codriver whose paycheck depends on your performance (if that doesn't motivate you, they will). I won't claim it's a stress free job, but compared to the stress I put on myself, it's nothing. You also get yourself out of your current environment. Where you are living (and the people you interact with) now is associated with your current behaviors. \n\nI won't claim I've completely broken the cycle, but I hit that low point far less often and it's much less devastating. My stress has gone down a lot, you have a health exam to get your cdl and my blood pressure was pretty high. Just got the exam again after about 10 months and it was normal. I don't plan on making a career of this, but I won't regret it. Its helped me realize what I want to do, and that's the first step towards motivation.\n\nIf you are suicidal though, please handle that before considering this. ",

Yellow is jaundice...\n\nDay five or six I start getting my right and left confused. Example: My sink is set up that dirty dishes are to the  right of the sink, wash in the right sink, rinse in the left sink, drain to the far left. When I'm depressed, I'll just sit there, moving clean and dirty dishes in the wrong directions, my arms and hands like pretzels.  All I want to do is wash dishes, not fix a car engine. What should take ten minutes can take a couple three days. I get frustrated, pile all the dishes into both sinks to \"soak\", add some bleach to the water so it doesn't smell, and leave it until I get it together. And that's why I have to take care of stuff, so that I have \"room\" for the invasive stuff that I can't get a grip on. So, I make sure I have less to grip. \n\n*spelling",

You should feel safe, comfortable in your home.  So make it that way and keep it that way.  Minimalism is the way to go in my opinion.

So if a room is cluttered I\u2019ll feel stressed, sad, irritable, and other negative emotions. If it\u2019s clean, tidy, and squared off and organized I feel so cozy and good. ",

When I start to get down and my mood plummets, I neglect apartment stuff because it is physically too taxing to get up and clean. The worse I feel, the worse it gets. Then when I wake up to squalor and have to navigate moldy dishes just to get a glass of water, or notice cobwebs on my guitar case or filth in my shower, it just makes me feel\nhorrible and uncomfortable.\n\n\nThen one day I sort of wake up with just enough energy to do *one* thing. And I tell myself okay, you are gonna put away the dry dishes this morning. Not even wash the pile in the sink, you are just going to make room for them.\n\n\nThen little by little I do just one easy thing, that'll make it possible to do the next thing. You will pick up your dirty clothes and that is all. You will take out the trash. You will dust the TV. And the process goes faster as my feelings level out.\n\n\nAnd then every now and then, by that evening, my apartment is spotless, and I light a big ass Yankee candle (which I ONLY do when my place is clean), turn on my lava lamp, and it's the coziest feeling in the world. And even if I'm still sad I'm not feeling quite as helpless, and My Bloody Valentine is playing, and I can walk across the floor without stepping over things, and my cat is curled up asleep on the quilt.\n\n\nThe next morning waking up things just seem so much better. Going on one week with a clean apartment as of today.",

And I just keep the flowers trimmed. It takes several days for the bloom to come up, so there's plenty of warning to clip them. \n\nPeace lilies are drama queens. If they need water, all the leaves wilt and it looks like it's dying. You give it water, and all the leaves pop up within minutes. And if you only water it when it wilts, you tend not to get blooms.

It's not even questioned anymore poeple just fucking see something and think, \"Yeah, me as well!\" Case in point: The dog vanishing thing. Did everyone have to record it after seeing one person do it? Really ?\nIts just blindly following the crowd under the guise of something \"trending\".\nBut more curiously, it is an old internet custom for, and i'm not being racist here, but typically I have noticed white people will steal things straight from Asians and not even try to credit them. It started with that \"Milk and Cereal (Cereal and Milk)\" video. Two Asian guys did it first, then about a year or two later, two white dudes copied it exactly.\nI have noticed that in recent years, Asians will typically innovate some sort of art or make up or cooking technique and it will be repeated on the internet until a (again, not trying to be racist or anything) white person will usually copy exactly what the Asian person does without really incorporating any originality into it, record themselves doing it, and post it online, where it will then go viral because its the first time most other white people have seen it. (I dont know why but it seems most minorities have some sort of world wide cultural exchange with Asia that tends to be lost on the whites...maybe because dbz was translated everywhere before it finally came to adult swim? Was it the kung fu, and later the Jackie Chan movies? Is it because some sort of Asian is everywhere, but usually the communities start out along side other minority neighborhoods?)\nBut the weird thing is, with the rise of things like Asian vines and this increasingly worldwide meme culture, the Asians are beginning to do the same thing! They just started copying western trends without changing them up as well!\nIt's all just one big pointless fucking circle. Everything is dying, which is why it sucks when you see someone basically steal someone's artistic style and ideas almost exactly and not really change it up at all- like that cereal and milk video.\nI wonder if it is because white people have seen a steady stream of media outlets where they appropriate other peoples cultures better than the person whose culture it is since the 80's. I'm not trying to be racist, this is just something that has happened, and maybe it explains some of the behavior I have noticed...",

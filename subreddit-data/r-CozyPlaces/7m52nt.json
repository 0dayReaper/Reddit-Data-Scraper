It does not.  But on occasion i\u2019ll meet someone who swears they were in my parents house years ago and saw the glass floor.  \n\nMy dad actually looked at putting in a glass floor to substantiate the rumors but it was crazy expensive so he didn\u2019t bother.",

There\u2019s a bit of a draft from all the windows but my parents keep their house 10 degrees hotter than I like so it\u2019s a great room to sit in. They bought the house after I was an adult and had my own family so, sadly, I don\u2019t spend too much time there other than holidays.",

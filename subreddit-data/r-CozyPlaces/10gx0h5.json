I stay at home with our toddler and run things part time at the moment, and our quality of life is good. \n\nIt's not the hardest country to move to; in the major cities you can get by without Dutch for quite a while, and there are a large number of international companies where the spoken language is also English. \n\nFeel free to pm me for more detail :)",

In this case the system works efficiently because both heat pumps and oil/gas furnaces work better with low water temperatures, and the large surface area enables low water temps. For electric heaters the large surface area doesn't matter because their efficiency (energy input vs. heat output) is always the same.\n\nHeated ceilings are not a good idea because cold air is denser and drops to the floor, while hot air rises to the ceiling. If you heat the ceiling, you'll have a pocket of warm air near the ceiling but the lower half of the room is going to stay fairly cold. So you have to crank up the temperature quite a bit in order for the whole room to be warm enough. Maybe they installed the heating elements in the ceiling because the house was/is carpeted, or because it was cheaper to do initially.\n\nIf electricity is cheap where you live, it may not be a big deal, but if it isn't cheap, you may want to look at alternatives. If you get a split AC unit from a decent brand and use that in heating mode, they use roughly 1/4 of the energy to produce the same amount of heat.",

I grew up in a poor immigrant family but went into medicine and my wife who also grew up lower middle class became a lawyer, and we never realized how good rich people have it until we started our careers. You also meet people in these professions who grew up rich and never realized anyone ever lived differently. Wild. But yeah, anyone who says money can't buy happiness is lying to you. It's not a cure all, but makes life so much easier. My parents used to fight about money all the time and we never do that.",

You'd either have a ton of 1 on 1 conversations with a recorder in the middle, or dozens of mini movies within one movie. It's a fantastic read, but wouldn't translate well to screen in its format. I think the movie did its best trying to incorporate as many key elements as possible. \n\nBut yes, the book is far better and a great read.",

Pare down the stories in the book to 3 core characters each in their own distinct place (probably China, Yonkers, and Israel or something) and merge some of the experiences so each character takes on 2-4 of the book stories. Open and close the movie with the interview ala princess bride or grand Budapest hotel. Bounce around to the 3 characters at distinct times in the crisis. And deliver other bits as stories heard by the characters.  The pilot could definitely be one of them, they could crash anywhere that fits another story, then they could hear through some military channel the story of the submarines. Something like that is what I wanted to see.",

That\u2019s if your leaving them out all the time.\n\nThere\u2019s products like deck renew and other thick deck restoration paints. They suck and will start to damage the joist and such as well. I would avoid them. If your wanting to try and save the lumber. I would rent a flooring sander from a big box store sand the top layer, and then stain and paint. Cheaper then replacing all the lumber and waiting for the new pressure treated wood to dry.\n\nSorry for the unsolicited input. It truly is a lovely cozy area.",

That stove is designed to generate an updraft to feed oxygen into the fire, which allows it to burn cleaner but it also means it burns hotter than otherwise. From there thermodynamics takes over via the stainless steel the stove is made of.\n\nThe stove has a stand that helps to lift it off the ground and reduce the surface area in contact with the deck to reduce the likelihood of damage. Without the stand, it will cause damage and may cause a fire. Even with the stand, the manufacturer recommends an abundance of caution when using the stove on a wood or composite deck.\n\nDon't be foolish playing with fire recklessly on top of the fires primary source of food. It is simple and cheap insurance to put down pavers and it could keep you from burning your house down.",

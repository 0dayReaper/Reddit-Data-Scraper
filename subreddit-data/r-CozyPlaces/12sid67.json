                    "comment": "Do it. The first myth I'm gunna bust is that open air PCs have more dust issues. This is clearly false. Consider the only dust that falls on this PC = slow vertical falling dust that falls everywhere else in your room. Simple to use a feather duster (or toothbrush) to swipe away every couple weeks or whatever.\n\nCompare this to a closed PC case with multiple fans exponentially amplifying the volume of air (and DUST)  through the case. Dust that is under pressure and gets packed tightly in all your cooling fins and fan blades and everywhere else that's hard to reach. Yes some PC cases have filters, but they need cleaning too = hassle.\n\nThis PC's CPU fan is set to zero RPM (see fan not spinning). Open air passive cooled. No noise, cool running and very little dust.\n\nThe only downside is if you have little curious kids or some pet like a parrot or cat -- for obvious reasons. NOT GOOD IDEA.\n\nFYI that's the Streacom BC-1 v2 Open Bench Table. Highly recommended.",

The powerwasher will likely strip the stain out unevenly and you\u2019ll just end up with Joseph\u2019s Technicolor Dream Deck. Ok maybe not that extreme but seriously it\u2019ll likely look worse, not better. Also, even a lightweight electric powerwasher is likely still gonna chop that soft wood up. So not only is it gonna be splotchy as fuck, you\u2019re also likely gonna damage the wood itself unless you spray from far enough away that you\u2019re not getting much off the deck in the first place.\n\nAll of that said, I\u2019m not saying you CANT powerwash a wooden deck. But the potential to fuck your deck up worse than it was when you started is very high, especially if you\u2019ve never done it before.\n\nEdit to add:\n\nSource: Guy who fucked his deck up not once but twice because he\u2019s too goddamn stupid to learn the first time\u2026 \u201cWell, of course I know him, he\u2019s me!\u201d",

I am on the power washing sub and I\u2019m pretty sure there is a lot of this talk and proper advice on types of pressure washers and what is most appropriate for each surface type. They get fairly nerdy with it. Rest assured that I will heed this advice if I ever do happen to have a wooden deck one day.",

The higher you can go the less bugs, mosquitos generally don't like to fly up, they just fly around horizontally. \n\nWe had a deck like that once, was about 30 feet up from the top of a 60' tall hill that steeply sloped away from the house. The deck was at eye level with the surrounding treetops, which was not only visually stunning but no mosquitos up there at all. Go down to the ground and you would immediately get bitten.",

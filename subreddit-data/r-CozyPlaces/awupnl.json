I'm not rich by any means, but if I was in the market for a table that I planned on having for a sizable portion the rest of my life, I would plan on buying nice. Same with any piece of furniture.",

They're continuously leaking, so the heating unit is always just playing catch up and that area will be a couple degrees colder than the rest of the house always.",

Hygge explicitly implies an enjoyable passage of time. \n\nA room would be \"koselig\" - \"cosy\".\n\nI'm not sure if the distinction is equally firm in Danish.\n\n(EDIT: It is slightly more flexible with respect to \"hyggelig\" than \"hygge\". You *could* say \"dette rommet ser hyggelig ut\" - \"this room looks cosy\", though I would argue that \"koselig\" would be better in that case as well; \"hyggelig\" works there because you are implying \"somewhere that would be cosy to spend time\")\n",

In Norwegian the direct translation for \"cosy\" is \"koselig\". \n\nThere are distinctions - e.g. you would *not* usually describe a room as \"hyggelig\", but as \"koselig\". \n\nHygge refers predominantly to social interactions or at least an enjoyable time, while koselig can refer to both social interactions *and* cosy in the English sense. \n\nI'd say you pretty much get the meaning of \"hygge\" if you translate it to \"cosy time\", and that also capture the passage of time aspect and makes it clear it does not apply to things.\n\nIf you're spending an evening with your family in front of a fireplace, for example, then that would be \"hygge\". As a result we also use \"hyggelig\" as a way of suggesting we're happy to have spent time with someone (\"it was nice to see you\" =&gt; \"det var hyggelig \u00e5 se deg\" *or* \"det var koselig \u00e5 se deg\")\n",

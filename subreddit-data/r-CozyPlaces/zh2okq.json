If they just sat for a few months and didn\u2019t spend anything except actual necessities they could have thrived, but they couldn\u2019t help themselves. (Oh and they absolutely had to have the top trim level for 30k more because you know, \u201cstatus\u201d and \u201cclout\u201d and all that bull shit.)\n\nAll of a sudden it becomes \u201coh I\u2019ll buy a steak tonight because it\u2019s on a 50% deal at the Jewels\u201d then after making bank it became \u201cI don\u2019t have cash on hand because I spent it on \u2018X,Y,Z\u2019 on some luxury item\u201d. \n\nIt creeps up on you and it\u2019s tough to train yourself. Once you had nothing and then you can have everything it can be bonkers what people\u2019s money will go to. \n\nAlso as a heads up, I never finished college due to mental health stuff, but if you want to make money and big money at that. Assuming you can talk the talk and walk the walk get into corporate sales. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of crazy but they are looking for the gift of gab and someone that can pitch a home run.

The whole family is having a reunion there next summer and I can\u2019t wait. \n\nMy aunt said the kitchen cabinets still have all the height markings we would make on every visit and when I add my middle aged height to that door I may get a little misty. That will almost certainly be the last time I enter a place where I made some of my favorite childhood memories.",

He was an incredible teacher and we actually asked him to speak at our high school graduation years after he had retired. And in his speech, he talked about each of us a bit (small town, not a huge class) and when he got to me, he had made a poem using my name and memories from my time in school with him. \ud83e\udd79\n\nI am just rambling now but I\u2019m glad I saw your comment and had that memory brought back to me.

Got paired with Herschel, and he was just freaking amazing. I'd stop by the home a few times a week on my way home from school and he loved the company and sharing stories from his life. And I loved and appreciated hearing them.  \n\nHell, my Eagle Scout project was to take the residents of the nursing home for an afternoon fishing at the local well-stocked lake. We took two busloads of elderly people to the lake that day.  \n\nNurses volunteered to help. The school and local ambulance services provided specialized transport and emergency support (which thankfully wasn't required). Local grocery store provided food and some volunteers to help cook it and serve people. Hardware/sporting goods store (yeah, smallish town) provided all of the fishing equipment.  \n\nIt was an amazing day out, and I will forever thank Herschel for giving me the idea one day when he said he wished he could go fishing just one more time.  \n\nSadly, my dad got transferred not too long after and my contact with Herschel waned and then he passed away. But I wouldn't trade that whole experience for anything.  \n\nI don't know how old you are or where you live or anything else, but if you're serious about an adopt-a-grandparent type thing, I recommend  reaching out to a local nursing home and seeing if those types of programs exist in your area.",

I always see ideas like these and wonder if they actually make it.",

To give you an example last quarter only 60 projects made it to 10k votes and between 2 and 3 of them get picked to be an official set :) \n\nIf youve ever seen the central perk, the office or the Winnie the pooh sets - they were all submitted through Lego Ideas :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso thank you for the support :)",

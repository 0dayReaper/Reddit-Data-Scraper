I had no idea how to take care of a garden so I just did nothing because I was worried I would ruin it. \n\nUnfortunately a lot of stuff started dying, so this year I took a week off work and committed to ripping up all the dead stuff and cleaning everything up. I added new soil and mulch and think it looks so much healthier now!\n\nThe lilac and two other bushes were there from the previous owner. I was about to rip up the big bush in the back corner because of how thorny it was but then I realized it was a quince tree and bears fruit! It was also likely planted to keep rats out bc of the thorns so I decided to keep it. I planted some herbs, a fig tree, bleeding hearts, and lavender in the planter. I already got 4 new sprouts on the fig tree! I also planted something with pink flowers on the left but I can\u2019t remember the name. \n\nI\u2019m not too precious about anything I planted; just want to see what works or what doesn\u2019t and I\u2019ll make adjustments next year \ud83d\ude0a",

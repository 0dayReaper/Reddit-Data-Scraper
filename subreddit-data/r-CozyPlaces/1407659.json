At the historic heart of Edinburgh's Old Town, The Witchery, now in our fifth decade, takes it name from the hundreds of women and men burned at the stake as witches on Castlehill during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It is reputed that more witches were put to death on Castlehill during the reign on James VI than anywhere else in Scotland. The area around The Witchery by the Castle remains steeped in history.\u201d\n\nThey aren\u2019t like, celebrating it I would say, but it\u2019s just a sad thing to be reminded of when you are sitting down to a romantic candlelit dinner or relaxing in your room.",

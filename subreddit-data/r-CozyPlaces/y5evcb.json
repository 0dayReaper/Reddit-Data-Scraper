A lot like the curve in the picture, but instead of the house in line with the road like here, there is a park with a large boulder. Also, there isn't a 0.25 mile runup like in the picture, but rather just about 100 yards. Despite this, there is still someone who hits the boulder hard enough to move it like 2-3 times a year. I don't understand it, and think this house would definitely be in harms way.",

I always like to create a vignette from the exterior as well\u2026and how lovey it would be to see the fixture through the window. Also, your ficus plant isn\u2019t doing you any favours in the spot under the art. Do a larger ficus somewhere else in the room. Just my opinion. Love the fall foliage.",

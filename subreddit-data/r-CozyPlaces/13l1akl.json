And maybe some kind of mid-height plant on the bedside table away from the tall lamp to balance things out vertically.",

My bedroom walls &amp; rug are a similar color to OP's and I just bought a new darker blue sheet set yesterday and an ivory colored blanket for our bed. I was a bit iffy on if the colors would go well together but your comment makes me feel a lot better about my choice. Thanks!",

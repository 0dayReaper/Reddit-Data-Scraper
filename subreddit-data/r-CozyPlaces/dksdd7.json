It's not the money or effort you dumped into making it look great. It's not the feng shui. It's not about the doilies or the stuffed animals or the raging fire or the circular window overlooking the mountain top. It's about the comfort of *stability.* Being able to settle down and relax fully, knowing there's nothing you gotta do, nowhere you gotta be, and nobody bothering you. You could do anything in that room because it's tidy and ready to go. As we get older, that becomes more and more coveted. You just want that place you can go to sometimes where the world stops and you can rest. \n\nFor OP it was a long journey to get to this point, but there it is. It's cozy, it's safe and it's all theirs.",

To my right is my dog, who has been walked this morning in the flurries outside, and who has been given his breakfast, and has since nested happily up in his beanbag bed at my feet. \n\nAcross the room by the kitchen, I got the woodstove going again, as it is 16 out right now, and it petered out a bit overnight after having been too warm in the evening. The fire is consistently lightly crackling as it works over the wood. \n\nOutside my car has just a light dusting across it, and I don't need it to go anywhere today. My errands include the post office, which I will walk to, and doing some light work online this morning, that I could do any other morning this week. Then a hike once the snow has stopped. \n\nAfter three years of grad school, two months of studying for ten hours every day for boards, last week signing for a job offer, and yesterday finding a rental and affirming I'd rent it for a year with the landlord, this morning is feeling pretty great. Last night was the first night I've slept throughout the night without waking up in months. \n\nI feel cozy.",

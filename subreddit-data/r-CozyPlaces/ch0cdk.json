I might have to copy that idea!",

She keeps herself occupied with lots of toys and watches out the windows and she\u2019s learned to tell us when she needs something by poking her water bottle or her food bowl. The only real issue is finding clean grass that isn\u2019t littered with piss bottles but the major truck stops are pretty clean. Here\u2019s a photo of her :) https://i.imgur.com/SoJSpcE.jpg",

It\u2019s also great that Love\u2019s is starting to add some off leash fenced in areas so that helps her get rid of some energy. I do feel bad when she looks bored though.. I see so many truckers with big dogs and sometimes two big ones and wonder how they can keep them entertained.",

They had been staying at the hotel for a little under a week or so, and so many people complained about the smell that he had to go talk to them, that's when they found out she was dying. They had stopped there so she didn't have to die in the truck, as they didn't have a home besides the truck since they'd just been driving for so long. She was bedridden at that point and they didn't want to go to a hospital or anything. The hotel management told them they couldn't stay, and contacted some sort of social service which came out and picked them up to take them to hospice. Pretty sad situation.\n\nAnother time they had gotten a call from someone looking for their brother who had been missing from a hospital for a few days. He was a hardcore alcoholic in bad shape and they were checking anywhere they thought he might've gone after leaving  the hospital against the doctor's recommendation. Sure enough he had checked in to the hotel a couple days before. They went to check on him and he wasn't answering, so they opened the door and found him immobile but kind of aware. He had been drinking and puking blood  everywhere. My friend showed me pics of the room, there was blood all over the toilet and sink, and out into the main room floor and wall.  Paramedics came and took the guy back to the hospital, but he seemed on the way out for sure.",

Asia, Europe, South America. They'd rent me a fancy apartment in London or Vienna or Hong Kong, then send me on trips to other nearby places (where I'd stay for 2-6 days in a nice hotel), always fully paid for. I lived on 4 continents and visited countless countries. I legit got to see the world, pretty much fully paid for (though I was working most of the time).\n\nA lot of people would be like \"holy shit that's an amazing lifestyle,\" and I did really enjoy it. But you know what I was thinking half the time I was doing it? \"Damn, I'm jealous of my old friends who just have a 9-5 and a nice house back home. Must be so comforting.\"\n\nIt's always hard to see the downsides, but even the coolest-looking lifestyles have them in spades.",

VR has been a thing for 50 years and may now just be reaching the point of commercial viability/success.  Speech transcription is a lot better now with better machine learning algorithms (and certainly commercially viable now with smart speakers), but it still sucks in a lot of ways.  Both of those categories have taken forever to reach points of commercial viability while long being considered near-future tech, and neither has the regulatory or perception issues of safety in automated vehicles (not a catastrophe if Siri doesn't understand you, but it will be if your car misinterprets its sensor signals).\n\nI'm far from an expert on autonomous driving, but I wouldn't be totally shocked if it ends up taking a lot longer than a lot of people and investors think.",

There are a lot of drivers that get trapped hauling run down trucks, or companies that won't tell you that you are violating some federal rule for a type of load.

We had a driver get stuck in a small town for 2 weeks waiting on repairs not getting paid.

If so, and don't feel obligated to answer this part, how does that affect intimacy?\n\n5) Are there any tips you can give for any issues you've run into relationship wise while on the road?\n\n6) Tips for finding a good company?",

I just used Snapseed for the majority of the edits (it's such an awesome photo editing app), and then I think I applied a Lightroom effect, which I had had to pay for. (There are all these various Lightroom filters you can purchase online, and sometimes those look great.)\n\nThat book on the desk is one I recently purchased at a steampunk convention from Tawny Frtiz called Stargazing. I just adored her lineart so much and all the details she puts into hair. :) Here's a link to her website: https://tawnyfritz.com/",

Also keeping with the theme of books I enjoyed growing up that shaped me as an author, I have some Dinotopia books there, too. (I also have 2 large Dinotopia art books that are signed, but they sadly are too big for this tiny shelf lol.) The top shelf has His Dark Materials and just a homeschooling book I reference for my two kids.",

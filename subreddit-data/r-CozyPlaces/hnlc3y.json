And this would really only happen around the holiday\u2019s.    \nOther than that, if I did get something new for my room, it was mainly posters (under 4 bucks) or small stuff.  \n\nNow at 22 I can actually afford to decorate my room and right now it looks very minimal but also sleek. That\u2019s the look I\u2019m into as of now :)   \nBut bc I never got a chance to decorate my room how I wanted when I was a kid, I can say that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if at 49 my room had pink walls, pink bedsheets, a sparkly lamp, a baby blue bookshelf etc. lol  \nEssentially just fulfilling my dreams as a kid.",

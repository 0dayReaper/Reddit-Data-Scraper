Also, pick out some fun inexpensive art for the walls to make it more personal - it feels a little hotel-ish (I think it's the tiles give it a commercial feel - but some wall decorations and a rug will make it perfect)",

Sometimes convenience is underrated , overrated? Idk which one I\u2019m supposed to use in that context",

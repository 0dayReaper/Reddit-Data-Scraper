We then put on our heavey over coats made of animal hide lined with goat fur and head out to the deserted streets lit by the gaslight  and the star dogged moon.

You might HATE the guy two blocks down, but when he is in need, you are there for him.\n\nThe flip side is that everyone knows everything about everyone else, and with few entertainment options, people get very gossipy. \n\nI would like to move to a small town full of open-minded, friendly, accepting, modern people.",

You can't ever pick your neighbors and some of them will suck. It's a hard life in the cold and the lonely, if beautiful. Don't idealize it. Make what you want where you are.\n\nAlso I would kill to be able to live like I do and still see standup comedy and order takeaway every night fuck it gets boring here.",

Having to drive atleast 20 minutes to the nearest town to shop or eat, or having to drive an hour to the nearest mall (which is barely even a mall) is taking a long time to get used to.\n\nMaybe it\u2019ll grow on me eventually, but since we\u2019ve moved I\u2019ve been gradually wishing to go back to what I\u2019m used to.

He puts on a special strong ale for Christmas Eve for all the regulars, only serves it by the half pint so that no one gets sloshed. It's been aging in the cellar for at least six moths and is mahogany brown, crystal clear with a foamy beige head. A few sips and you can feel it warming you up with hints of toasted malt, toffee, a touch of treacle, and faint, marmalade-like hops. Just a touch of fruity esters and a moreish but not bone-dry finish. \n\nThis is being pulled as the regulars mill about sharing their Pollyanna gifts for one another as the local trad folk gang does some wonderful renditions of classic Christmas tunes. It is with a happy, yet wistful heart, that we part, but knowing that at home the tree and a fireplace are ready for us - all you need to do is walk the short distance home under that starry sky, get the fire going, and fall asleep with a loyal dog at your feet.

A room like this one of OP\u2019s is an A+ in my book. \n\nI have a room painted almost (or maybe exactly) this same \u2018peacock blue\u2019 color. It doesn\u2019t have much natural light in it tho - just from 1 window in the front of the house. It was converted from a garage, but you can\u2019t tell from inside. Mine\u2019s kinda tribal theme &amp; I use it for ~dark chaos~ - everything that\u2019s not super colorful like every other room in my house :P. I\u2019ve got a kinda-sorta art deco/surreal theme in one room, another vintage retro-y, and tropical kitchen, but they\u2019re by no means polished, just general categories for the chaos",

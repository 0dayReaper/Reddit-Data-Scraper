They have friends in their social circles who fly by private helicopter and own yachts. So I suppose in their mind anything less than personal choppers, yachts, and mansions, is \"poor\".",

Her mother was a pretty high level private sector consultant, and her father was in admissions at a pretty high level for a very prestigious university.\n\nShe thought, because of her surroundings and her parents tendency towards humility (driving Honda\u2019s and having a pretty modest house, albeit in a very expensive and wealthy area,) that her family was poor because she didn\u2019t wear designer clothes as a child.\n\nNow , my childhood wasn\u2019t really wanting. I never felt any financial strain (whether it was present or not as a child who knows) in my home as a child. My mom worked part time for $12/hr and my father sold car parts. But boy, did I have a hard time getting over this girl\u2019s total lack of perspective on her family\u2019s financial situation.",

They grew up in a bubble where having a yacht is rich and having 2 cars is broke. They use those words to describe their experience. They can\u2019t possibly imagine what it\u2019s like to have to hold on to a tiny amount of money because you just paid rent and have almost nothing left till your next paycheck. They know these problems exist but they\u2019ve never come in contact with them. Generally speaking, with age and experience, they come to be more aware of their place in the world, especially if they leave their parents\u2019 nest and have to manage their own money. I\u2019m not saying the class divide we have is anywhere near ok, I\u2019m just saying I don\u2019t always harshly judge kids and young people who act like this.",

When people weren't demolishing old, beautiful architecture to erect tall, ugly, concrete-only brutalist structures on the homefront it was very much similar. Absolutely beautiful old fireplaces from the Victorian era up to the mid 1950s were being [covered in paint](https://www.littlehouseonthecorner.com/restoring-an-original-cast-iron-fireplace/) because old was so chique, and absolutely *gorgeous* wood panel floors made with wood planks from some really old trees were covered in either linoleum, which could be removed with a lot of work, or worse off shag carpet, which would just fester moisture and mold and ruin such beautiful flooring.",

There are radiators in this room but we shut them off and close this room over most of winter. Downstairs is properly insulated and there is a cosy living room there with fireplace so we tend to have summer and winter spaces. The place stays cool in summer, especially downstairs. The walls are a metre thick so well insulated. Helps that there are 3 levels. Lower levels are easier and less costly to heat.",

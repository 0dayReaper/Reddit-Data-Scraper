This has been well over a decade and a half or more. My memory is not all that great anymore. \n\nBut you asked for details so.....\n\nThe idea of using a logging chain is not original. One night I happened to be surfing trying to find some idea for floor finishes. I knew I didn't want it to look like laminate. I came across a few ideas about distressing, and there was one that used a chain as well, but just for indentations. \n\nThe house was built in the 50's. A lowly 2 bdrm, 1 bath, sitting on 8-ish acres. I believe the original owners were probably poor. The house is stick built, but a lot of the timber looks to be seconds from a saw mill. When I redid the kitchen, I had to rip out everything because the old counter tops were about 3\" lower than standard height. \n\nAt the time it was located in what you would call 'the sticks' but over the years progress has progressed. I'm still a fair ways out still, but it's coming.  \n\nSo, floors. BTW I am not a pro, nor a wood worker. Most of anything I know, I've learned by doing, or learned from others, taken advise, nothing formal. \n\nUnderneath linoleum rug, 60's maybe 70's ugly carpet that I assumed was a 'plush' pile when new, now literally thread bare. So ripped all of that up and what I was confronted with were beautiful, wide plank, wood floors. They had seen their day for sure as far as water stains, the wood was not the highest quality with knots that had worn out. There were burn marks around the buck stove in the atrium, and around the fireplaces. \n\nIt hurt me to lightly sand this floor. LOL There was just so many years of character. So I lightly, and I mean ever so lightly sanded. In the dining room the linoleum had been glued down with what looked like black tar. That was a nightmare of solvents and elbow grease. I finally got all that up but it needed just a little more sanding than the rest. Then proceeded to beat the shit our of it, pretty much. I mean there was a method to my madness. In some areas that I didn't think had enough, I took an awl and poked small holes simulating some type of wood boring beetle. In other areas when I wanted specific control of the distressing, I would use a torch. just gently. \n\nVacuumed, then vacuumed 10 more times...lol. Then down with the light stain, let dry, then down with the 3 coats of poly.\n\nBut all of these ideas are not my own and were borrowed from stuff all across the web.",

For your situation, you could go with conduit or EMT on top of the brick. It\u2019s looks somewhat industrial, as all your boxes and conduit are exposed, but I always like the look of well-fitted conduit.

It was a tight but long space measuring 9ft wide by 16 ft long. We decided to have no upper cabinets anywhere so as to make it as open as possible. The kitchen counter top is an old science room/lab room desktop which still has some scribbles and scratches in it. The door knob out to the yard was one i salvaged from a jobsite in new york many years ago and have kept with me in order to one day install in my home in Ireland (I've 4 in total)\nBeams and flooring were salvaged (beams from a barn in Cavan and the flooring came from and old train station in london)\nBelfast sink also salvaged.\nLots of reclaimed stuff in it but we didnt want it to look like it wasnt all fully considered. Not our perfect kitchen but  we feel its perfect for this space (original content) Stars hanging from the beams are not permanent)",

A lot of stuff was purchased from people all over Ireland which involved me traveling and meeting them and talking about the items.\nOne of the beams still has a hitch where they tied up  the horses in the barn they came from. The wooden lintels over the windows came from a tree that was felled 20 minutes away from the house. I drove and hour away to get them. The floor came from a guy 4 hours away who worked in london, salvaged the flooring from an old trains tation they were demolishing and put them in a storage container at his house where they sat for 30 years til I saw him selling them.\nThe grate in the fireplace came from a man who built their dream house with his wife, she paid for the grate to be made but died before she ever got to light it. The first night we lit it I sent him a picture of it and thanked him.\nSorry I'm ranting now hahaha.",

I don't know what is above, and do not know where you are or what your regulations are, but consideration should always be given to the spread of fire in building design, particularly around kitchens where the risk of fire is higher than other rooms. Are the joists suitably sized to allow for a period of sacrificial burning to prevent the ceiling collapsing? Have you taken any measures to stop the upwards spread of smoke to allow for occupants in the rooms above to safely escape? \n\nJust some food for thought from a career Building Surveyor.",

Basically, it prevents tear downs and gutting of buildings whose history is deemed important or rare.  When getting building/renovation permits, they are legally required to preserve certain aspects of the architecture as long as they do not render the building unsafe.  Inspections throughout the process ensure that the proper techniques and materials are used.",

The \"open\" feel of the American kitchens I grew up with (bright, light filled, free flowing) and the quaint, comfort, cozy, \"honest\"  feeling that Irish homes seem to have. \n\nI've been looking for a home now for about a year, hoping to buy in the next 6 months (c'mon, housing crisis, chill a mo!) and this kitchen has reminded me that I can create my dream space, slowly but surely, in some of the older, beautiful, comforting homes I've seen where the kitchens are missing the charm.

I have a female snow shoe but especially for a female she is enormous my Tasha has a large frame the vet says unusually large for a female AND she is over weight. She was 28 pounds. She ways more then my 1.5 yr old grandson!! Lol. She did lose 2 pounds bcz I have a catio for her at our winter place we are there Oct to June. I had to get a carrier on wheels to get her to the gates at the airport bcz she weighs so much it\u2019s hard to carry her the first time a nice man offered to do it for me &amp; even he was stunned a cat was in there. Lol. I\u2019m giving her special low cal food now so let\u2019s hope. I actually gave her her own FB page. Natasha the wonder cat.  Lol. If you want to peek at her. Do you notice your rag doll can put on weight easily? Or no ?  I\u2019m just curious. She looks like she\u2019s a good weight. I\u2019m always curious what others do to keep their cats fit.  I don\u2019t want her to end up diabetic. Which could happen if I don\u2019t figure this out for her.  Just curious how you keep her in a good weight or him ? &amp; what you feed them? Thanks.",

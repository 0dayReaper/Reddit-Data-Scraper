But people are saying really nice things about Morocco and whilst I was only there a few days my experience was generally a lot more negative. \n\nLots of intolerance. Like, the most I ever experienced. Lots of mob mentality if you ever called anyone out for trying to scam you, which happened often. We were attacked for playing music during a call to prayer. We weren't moshing away to metal. There was a radio on the window and it was just on. He had a knife. \n\nI have light blonde hair and everyone would always make comments. Not nice ones. \n\nI was made to pay 20 pounds in a taxi which was no more than 10 minutes. The driver let a local in and he got out before my stop and he just left. I was told at the start it would be about 5 pounds. When I argued at the end I found myself surrounded by a lot of other taxi men. Same thing happened with a cigarette street vendor. \n\nAn American girl I was with was called a fucking American pig when she didn't want to barter for an item. He grabbed her arm when she tried to leave. When she pushed him off her we got surrounded again. \n\nThere is more but this was just 4 days. \n\nI realise people lie on the internet but this is all utterly true. I hated it and will never go back. \n\nDid I just get really unlucky? \n\n*edit* I had hitchhiked from Manchester, England to Tangier, then travelled via trains and buses to Marrakesh. ",

You are in a third world country and it is going to be different than your comfortable lifestyle wherever you are.  After all,  whats the point of traveling if you can't have an open mind and  willing to experience a new culture.   For start,  I always recommend to stay in a reputable hotel.  Mariott, Hyatt Etc.   Don't stay in shitty areas.   Find a reputable tour guide.  Stick with him your entire trip when you are visiting the city, souk etc.  You can hire one easily for dirt cheap.   He will take you to the best spots.   You dont need to make your trip complicated.    You can easily stay in a nice resort by the ocean.  Relax,  have a good time and enjoy the food.   No need to wander the streets of Morocco at night as I would not do the same in London, New york or Los angeles.   I have seen people walking in grocery stores carrying Guns in  grocery stores in US (perfectly legal)  and it freaked me out and this is something illegal in Morocco",

It was perfect. \n\nI travel a lot, I've been to quite a few places, so I knew I wasn't in London or anything like that. But when I travel I don't like resorts or hotels. That's just getting a rich western country stored in this area with a pool. Absolutely nothing against it, just not what I do. I love meeting locals, getting to know sights and food. I don't like the idea of having to buy a guide so that they can protect or save me from locals. That I do not want to explore. ",

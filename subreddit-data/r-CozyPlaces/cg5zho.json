A handful of times, the situation called for lifting each whole half of the house with a crane and lowering it into place. We set up houses all over, from 110 degree heat in Nevada to 20 degree snowing sideways blizzards in Montana.",

Since you have to pay rent on the lot and pay for the trailer itself you basically are paying for it twice. Its a money sink that drags people down so even when you are pulling cash in you get further stuck in poverty. Poverty leads to higher rates of crime, domestic abuse, and a lack of healthcare which in turn leads to families being far larger and then they can't support the kids and its too cramped but they can't leave because it's a money sink. Its a vicious cycle that's hard to break and designed that way on purpose.\n\nOf course this isn't everyone but it's the image that people see in media and as someone who lives in a trailer park there are definitely a lot of people who fall into this. They aren't bad people, they just have bad circumstances.\n\nEDIT: for context I'm speaking from my personal experience living in trailer parks.",

But here that is 5 acres and a brand new double wide.   And Ive looked, some of those fuckers are pretty awesome. I was at a point where I was just going to demo mine and get a new one. Which is another cool thing about MHs is that you can trade up.\n\nSome neighbors down the road sold their 15 year old DW.  I drive by one day and its gone.  2 weeks later brand new house, hooked up pinned and skirted.",

Let's put a different, more concise spin on it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-Lot rent is a fraction of what rent is in even the most downtrodden, crime ridden, slum apartment complex. Long term, you spend less.\n\n-Your neighbors, if you have them, aren't connected to you; nobody is above you, beside you, under you. You won't hear them taking a shower, having sex, yelling at their cat, going to work, coming home, playing with their kids, smell them getting high, and you won't catch their bedbugs/roaches.\n\n-You park in front of your home. No worrying about who scratched your car, who broke your window, who stole your radio.\n\n-You have a washer and dryer in your home, instead of a common area where you have to worry about putting quarters in the machines, getting your clothes stolen or thrown out, having to wait on other people, and deal with lugging laundry up and down stairs.\n\n-You can decorate/paint/remodel whatever you feel like. No need to ask permission from your landlord if you want to paint the walls.\n\n-Have what pets you want. In most parks, dogs and cats and whatever else don't matter as long as you don't let them run free.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nParks differ, but it's not hard to find a decent one. If you're able, it's best to buy an acre and throw a trailer on it. You'll save money after the first year on lot rent, and it'll last until you save for a house.",

I've raised 3 kids in a 2 bedroom condo, and while I would certainly like a bit more space, those homes seem so wasteful. Rooms that rarely get used; basements the size of my condo with home theatre set ups, workout rooms, bars, and they don't get used. Living rooms and dining rooms that no one goes into, as they spend all of their time in the kitchen, family room, and bedrooms...which turns out to be the same amount of space we use in our home.",

When she first left, one of her friends let her stay in her spare bedroom that had a bunk bed. I was still able to visit and had a place to sleep too. I was just exited I got to sleep in the top bunk. \n\nWe moved into a one bedroom apartment eventually. I still had my own bedroom at my dad's house. I was an only child so I valued my time alone even at a young age. I remember spending a lot of time reading in the bathroom lol and using our walk in closet as my play room for some alone time. Unfortunately I also remember being embarrassed about inviting my friends over, but we had a playground right next to our building so we had other kids around and area to explore. We were able to move into a house with my step dad as I entered middle school. \n\nIt's been almost 20 years since then and I am almost the age she was when that happened. I'm so grateful for all the sacrifices my mom made for me. She gave me the life she was never able to have herself because of her shit parents (which I think is why she still spoils me today.) I try to make a point to tell her how proud I am of her any time I can. I told her recently she had an incredible \"glow up\" which I had to explain right after lol. \n\nKeep doing what you're doing. You sound like an awesome mom. There may be tough days when your daughter may not fully understand why you guys are in your situation, but she's still a kid. It took me a while to while to realize every decision she made was in my best interest. My mom did such an awesome job and so will you. Best of luck \ud83d\udc96",

It\u2019s truly a blessing. \n\nThey complain about their neighbors waking them up at sunrise with lawn mowers, construction, train/car horns, HOA, etc... yet they can never leave that one spot. \n\nNext week I plan to head west for Glacier national park to meet up with an old friend who says she\u2019s been itching for a weekend with me in the van. Along the way I\u2019ll hit mount rushemore and crazy horse maybe the badlands. \n\nI always brush off the comments people make when they first learn about my van. It\u2019s everything I could want and more. There\u2019s always a predictable timeline with what they say, and I\u2019m always right with it.

If you sit close to a window all day you will constantly be exposed to UVA rays as if you were sitting outside and UVA is essentially the sole reason why our skin ages and why a 50 year olds skin doesn't look like that of a 15 year old. So if you would like to keep your skin from looking old and you are in front of a window then sunscreen would prevent that. Up to you.",

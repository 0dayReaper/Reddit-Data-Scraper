That would be my only big issue.\n\nOtherwise, is the price reasonable?  How much work does the cabin need?  Water source? Septic, outhouse, roof leak, electricity (this isn't an issue for some), heat source--working fireplace?  Does the property flood? Has it ever?\n\nThese are the things I would think about. If it checks out for you, give them an offer!  Sooner the better, wouldn't want to lose it.  It's beautiful, I would love to live there! As long as that's not a busy road!

There is a steep bit of highway (only 100m or so) around the 31km mark that I had to walk up. After that, the last 10km is a gentle downward slope into the city. The locals/spectators are into it and it feels like a cultural event as much as an athletic one. 10/10 would definitely recommend. Carb load with gyros and baklava and you'll be fine.",

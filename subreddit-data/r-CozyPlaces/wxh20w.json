I figured it would be something like periodic scans for smoke and marking lightning strikes during storms; Always on shift, but rarely requiring you focus on it for hours straight. What are you doing during work hours and what if a fire starts outside of work hours?",

She was a 13-year veteran wildfire lookout at Athabasca in Canada. \n\nShe failed to make her scheduled radio check in for work on August 26, 2008, so her supervisor called to see if she was OK, whoever answered hung up repeatedly without saying a word. Then the phone was unplugged from its socket and the line went dead. \n\nWhen the supervisor arrived at the site of the lookout, he found her truck was still parked outside. He checked the living accommodation and there was a pot of water that had been left boiling on the stove unattended. But there was no sign of Stephanie.\n\nFurther investigation by the authorities showed some items were missing from her cabin: two pillows with blue covers, a burgundy bedsheet, a Navajo-patterned duvet, and a gold watch. \n\nHer body and the missing cabin items have never been found.",

A 100ft metal tower, that swayed somewhat, and would actually \"bang\" from the slight flexing, when wind hit it. I felt pretty safe though.   \n\n\nI then worked in a 20ft wooden tower, with a cab that was 15ft by 15ft, there was little to no sway on that.   \n\n\nThe third tower was a two story cement block BLM style tower, which was solid as shit. It was just a cement block base, with a wooden tower built on top, basically a little shorter than a typical two story house. That thing was solid as hell, but it was also out in the desert so there were no trees to block the wind.",

Anyway, the young woman on his district's tower had to go back to college, but the year was dry and they needed someone up there, so he got the assignment (despite some concerns about kids on tall towers).\n\n\nAnyway, there were logbooks from decades prior. Several started out waxing lyrically about the beauty and the peace but those all ended with angry rants about isolation and how they couldn't wait to get off the tower. We had each other (and cats) and were fine. I just thought it was funny how many had the pattern of loving it at first and loathing it at the end.",

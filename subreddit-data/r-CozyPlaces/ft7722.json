It was super hard to get it light enough to read, since the walls sucked the light out of the light bulbs, but I didn\u2019t spend much time there so it didn\u2019t matter. \n\nOne night a burglar climbed in the fire escape and stole purses and wallets from all my sleeping roommates, including a purse hung on the foot of one bed. My room was so dark the burglar didn\u2019t even bother to come in, or that\u2019s what we figured because I was the only one not robbed.",

My current dog is a blue heeler/Australian shepherd and she\u2019s 5 this year so I won\u2019t get another dog until she is gone (hopefully not for a good long time) I can only handle one at a time but I\u2019m a very responsible dog owner, are these somewhat easy to care for?",

He is incredibly loyal, gentle, doting, loving, and cuddly. Great with most dogs and most people. He basically doesn't shed with the fur mix. His energy levels are low (may be a con for an active person). Supposedly the poodle cross makes them a bit healthier so the average lifespan is about 12 years. He is so easy to walk and take places. Of course training and socialization is still needed for all of this!\n\nCons: very smart, so he chooses when to misbehave /ignore commands. He is a bit skittish and frightened at times to new things until he gets used to it. He is a bit overprotective so took some time training that out (this is likely not breed specific though). Has some hunting drive from poodle to chase. His fur while non shedding takes a ton of maintenance because it mats easily. I shave him about every 6 weeks to keep it managed. He is about 95 lbs and that is a big dog ! Food costs and vet bills are therefore higher.",

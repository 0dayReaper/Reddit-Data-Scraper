I haven't had too many issues with command hooks, but that adhesive cable hider has me sworn off most \"damage-free\" adhesive products for life. You are absolutely right it is much simpler to spackle screws or a hole than to fix the potential damage these things cause. We had to buy spackle, orange peel and paint to match our rental on move out. Luckily it wasn't a super nice apartment so the 3ft long spackled/ painted spot went unnoticed.",

They also enjoyed the candles so much that they decided to leave them up permanently in the dining room.",

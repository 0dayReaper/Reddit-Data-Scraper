And that appeals to a deep evolutionary side, as dimmly lit caves were pretty much the safest environments for humans for like 90000 years.",

I dont get it. Anxiety would be over the ivory roof!     \n\nAnd the furniture are always jagged and super unconfortable looking. They make better decorations and than as an actual seat.  \n\nI dont get it.

A lot of folks in CO talk about Utah, Jackson Hole, and Montana but the best time, cabin, and people we\u2019ve experienced have all been in Idaho. \n\nI really specifically like the area Idaho just on the other side of the state line from Jackson Hole, WY. We stayed for a week with a wonderful woman on a ranch in a separate cabin on the property and woke up to moo\u2019s from cows and the cleanest air of my life and drove to Yellowstone for day trips. \n\nLOVE Idaho.",

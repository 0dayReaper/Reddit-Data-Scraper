I am also a perpetually exhausted nurse though so I suppose it could be that lol. \n\nI\u2019m from Detroit and one of our greatest hidden gems are the incredibly diverse architectural styles. I mean you literally wouldn\u2019t believe the uniqueness, splendor and awe of some of our older homes and buildings. \n\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s mostly inspired by Medieval Tudor,  Gothic Style, Cottage Style and far too many more to get into but I tell everyone to check out the house tours if they\u2019re visiting. \n\nMay I ask how old your home is and what style it is? I love ranch homes because my knees love ranch homes \ud83e\udd23 but my affinity for interior and landscape architecture makes me go full on school girl seeing cool stuff like this. Congratulations on having a home that truly FEELS like home if you know what I mean lol.",

How can I best engage with and take part in the endless years of human thought and civilization within that short span? Well, writing is the central and most well-developed part of the human experience, and some of the greatest things we have ever produced as a species are the books we've made and the stories we've told. So if I want to really dig into the best of what our kind has to offer, I need to read the best of the stories we've produced.\n\nSo I started reading the classics. Most of the books on this shelf were written in the last two centuries, but I've also really dug into things like the story of Gilgamesh, stories of ancient gods, native legends, etc. etc. I'm trying to get a universal, cross-cultural understanding of how humanity has seen and represented the world. I don't wanna live my life in the bubble of the society I was born into and raised in. I'd rather experience as much of the rest of the world, and its history, as possible. Reading is the only way to do that.",

Be sure to steam it. I didn't before the pic.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PPDR928?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share\n\n(3) Tent - steam it. I Didn't do so before the pic. I used the little lights to light up the fire for the pic.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B5RH3R7M?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share\n\n(4) overhead light for the interior. Works great. Lots of settings.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRMV3FTG?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share\n\n(5) campfire - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C5FDNRK?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share\n\n(6) grass rug - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CGWKLLW?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share\n\n(7) wood stools - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M68CHDV?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share\n\nGot this after the pic.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082NXXYTG?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share\n\nEdit: I am not an affiliate.

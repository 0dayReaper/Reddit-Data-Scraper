Nice pattern, will look great as it wears. Well selected for your color motif\n\nThe bad bitch neon sign. I am taken back to me, on the floor of my parent's living room, watching Batman 2 and gawking at the dommy mommy kitsch bedroom of Michelle Pfeifer's catwoman. It's a nostalgic gem that takes up the space well and adds a modern touch. \n\nThat golden barrel-shaded lamp. what a find. Eastern influence really rounds out worldly feels in maximalist rooms. \n\nThe womanly figurines placed throughout the room. What a flow of feminitiy. I love abstracted humans as a decor motif. \n\nMazel tov. I wish you prosperous dusting and vacuuming in the future.",

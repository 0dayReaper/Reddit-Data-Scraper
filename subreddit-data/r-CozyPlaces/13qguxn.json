Right above the entrance seems like a perfect spot to put a 75\" TV on the wall. \n\nedit: if the back wall behind the couch was painted a dark color it would make the space feel larger its a common interior design trick to paint one wall dark. If it was painted a navy blue it would change the whole vibe \n\nhttps://www.apartmenttherapy.com/ways-to-make-a-small-space-feel-bigger-paint-one-wall-dark-243124",

Years later still best friends with the next door neighbors they intro us to the couple now renting our old house and thinking of buying it from their landlords. Walk in to check out the place and wow that wall is gone.  People that bought it from us removed a load bearing wall by themselves.

I\u2019m just a pipeman (bottom of the rank structure, do all the manual firefighter stuff like pulling hoselines to attack the fire, forcible entry, chest compressions, etc.) so I\u2019m not exactly sure how this would go into the computer (probably under notes in our system, but I don\u2019t use the computer ever, the company officer is in charge of that) but it actually probably would be a good idea to notify your local fire department about this (they never covered secret rooms in any of my classes/the academy so I\u2019m not entirely sure how it would go or what building codes say about something like this).  I can only speak for myself but if something happened in there like a fire or someone had a heart attack I would be absolutely baffled and wouldn\u2019t think to starting breaking through random walls so the fire would take off or and/or you would probably die.  Only thing that might give us a clue before the paint started bubbling would be a thermal imaging camera, but confusion would abound.\n\ntl;dr: it would be a clusterfuck lol\n\nEdit: also not sure if notifying your local fire department would get your cool secret theater taken away, so weigh the odds of dying a fiery death against your fire codes (sprinkler systems work wonders and they don\u2019t all go off like in the movies, just the ones close to the fire, so those might be a good idea if you gotta keep the secret room a secret).",

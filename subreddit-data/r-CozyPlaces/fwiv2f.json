It was tiny and old, full of fleas, but I was considering it because it was in my price range.  We went back outside after, into the lawn which was also full of fleas, and while we were brushing them off I looked up and noticed windows near the roof of this one story house.  She said it was odd for an attic to have windows unless it was a finished attic so we went back in.  The house had a rickety old attic ladder, the sort you would never want to use on a daily basis, and at the top was a really nicely finished attic room.",

Me 21 hanging out with this other girl who was 19. So we hid cause that\u2019s what she thought was a good idea. She\u2019s worried about cop trouble and I was less worried. We hear them kick everyone else out. No arrests. Then they say something along the lines of if you\u2019re still here it means you live here so we will be taking information\n\nLuckily the room we were in had this weird nook with blinds over it. Everyone assumed it was a window. Usually blinds were open (cause it\u2019s weird to keep storage behind blinds? but whatever). I pull the blinds down as we crawl in the space. Was it perfect? Probably not but it was pretty darn good. My *Friends* didn\u2019t even realize it was extra storage until we went to open a window one day so I thought it was as safe a bet as any. About now they are two rooms over and I know for a fact one of the roommates door is locked so they would walk in our room next. \n\nSuddenly, the girl decides *now* is a good time to start panicking. In the *loudest* of whispers she starts going off \u201cOh shit what are we going to do?! I can\u2019t get taken away!! Oh fuck!!! blah blah blah\u201d\n\n...Obviously this girl has never played hide and go seek growing up. So I tried to shush her, calm her down, something, *Anything*. I can hear the door beginning to open so I ended up kissing her to keep her quiet her eyes close she shuts up the main flicks on. The cop (I assume as I can\u2019t really see) takes one look around and shuts off the light and heads downstairs. \u201cOh my god my heart is *pounding*\u201d! (*I see this all as an absolute win*)\n\nwe sneak out the back, while cops are confiscating booze out of the basement, and walk back to my place Scott free.",

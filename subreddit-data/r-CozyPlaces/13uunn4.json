The building is from the 1890s (\u201cAltbau\u201d with high ceilings so most of the small rooms have built-in bunk beds) and a few people have done great things to their rooms. \n\nMight ask a former roommate ( who took down the rug from some of the walls so the original stones are visible) if I can take pics of his room too and post it on here. You guys would love it ;)",

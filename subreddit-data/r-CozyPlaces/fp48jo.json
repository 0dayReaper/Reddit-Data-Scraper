I love it, I am so envious of people that can transform a room into a vision like this, I tell people I don't like fuss in my house but honestly its because every time I have tried something *bold* like this, it looks garish and tacky \ud83d\ude05 \n\nTHIS room... I can *smell* the leather in the picture, it literally smells like opulence and I *love* the colour choice on the walls. It feels very contemporary but also has a speakeasy vibe.\n\nHey OP can you come and make my study exactly like this??",

I mean cheap paint is like $25-30 a gallon and excellent paint is ballpark $50 gallon, so you're maybe talking tops an extra $50 per room but the difference is astounding. Obviously there's very nice furniture as well, but I think it's very much worth it to get great paint.",

Will be spending a lot of time in here for isolation!\n\nFirst post:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyPlaces/comments/ejre4v/my\\_cozy\\_space\\_with\\_a\\_glass\\_or\\_two\\_of\\_whiskey\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyPlaces/comments/ejre4v/my_cozy_space_with_a_glass_or_two_of_whiskey_to/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**FAQs:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Q: What do you do for a living? A: Healthcare IT  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Q: Where did you find your furniture?  A: Too many random places to remember.  Mostly furniture wholesalers/warehouses.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Q: What was your budget?  A: What budget?!   Seriously though, I'd prefer not to answer this directly.  I've replied to a few requests re: costs for furniture.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Q: Why do you have a rug on carpet?  A: To tie the room together.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Q: Why don't you have hardwood floors?  A: $$$ + wife.  I may do it one day though.  Have some other priorities for remodeling.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Q: Why don't you paint the door and frame?  A: I kind of like the contrast of the white against the rest of the room, honestly.  But I welcome suggestions and may eventually switch it up.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Q: What brand/color paint did I use for the walls? A: Sherman-Williams 7615 Sea Serpent  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Q: Why did you use a filter on the second photo and not the first?  A:  I didn't.  No filters or manual photo adjustments here.  Just night mode on my OnePlus 7 Pro.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Whiskey questions**:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Q: What kind of whiskies do you have?  A: Roughly half bourbon/rye, roughly half scotch, and a few Japanese and Irish.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Q: Do you drink alone in this room?  A: Never, as I'd be quite bored.  It's for socializing with a couple buddies or hosting tasting sessions.  Hence the lack of a television.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Q: Do you get plastered like every night?  A: I never get anywhere near drunk.  Matter of fact, I usually only have 2oz any given night, which is only a few times a week.  Getting regularly hammered on whiskey is generally frowned upon by the whiskey collecting community.",

Yeah, it won't be stuff that'll last 30 years..but with adults using it, it'll last 5 or maybe even 8-10 years without major issues. \n\nShelving could be DIY.

There's a LOT of stuff that looks very nice, but is incredibly cheap - sub $700 for a basic set. It won't break when you sit in it. It might smell like the kids who varnished it sealed it in plastic before it had time to dry.",

My mother was driving and we just followed the tour busses up to the road, notboating attention to the signs. Made it all the way up themountain and halfway through the city and never once wondered why we hadn't seen another car. Got stopped by a police man who started pounding on our car. They wouldn't let us drive out so they got other policemen through the city until we were able to roll back out down hill. The ultimate roll of shame. ",

Buy the airline tickets 1st then plan the trip around your flight. If you are stayibg someplace for a day or two, book &amp; pay for that room, then the next, set back train &amp; taxi fees. It can be done. I am proof of that. Every year I take a vacation out of the country. I just got back from Egypt, Japan was last year. I have been to Greece, London, Iceland, Mexico &amp; Cambodia in the last few years. Dont make excuses, make plans. Live!\n\n",

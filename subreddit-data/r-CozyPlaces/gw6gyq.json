They\u2019re both really capable tools but recently I had to replace my Milwaukee impact while my dads makita is still going. Maybe I just abuse my tools more I\u2019m not sure but if it weren\u2019t so expensive to switch ecosystems I\u2019d go to makita",

I work in automation but in the oil and gas industry, and the Miwaukee drills we were issued needed to be treated like princes otherwise they would act up. Nothing like being 10 stories up, going through monkey ladders, to have the drill you brought *and* the spare drill fail on you to swear them off. We now have Bosch Industrial that has taken a tonne of punishment (don't get the home appliance version, I heard from our insulation team that it sucks ass, and they are using drills all day everyday). I have seen some people abuse a DeWalt too, with no issues. But I am never using a Milwaukee again, nor will my colleagues.",

We will be moving soon and we are talking about building shelving/headboard/wall unit for the master bedroom. It is ambitious, but I figure if my husband and I can figure out to do things like fabricate fire walls out of sheet metal, etc. with some youtube help we should be able to build a shelving unit on the headboard wall.",

You can now make 80% of the stuff you want.",

Much faster and convenient to have 6 tools, rather than switching them out each time. I agree I got carried away though, haha. When I started building things, I just had one old corded Black and Decker drill. It took forever to switch between bits and drivers. On big projects, I really will use most of them, and they do have different features and ratings. The saws have different blades on them and are different sizes. The Sanders have different grits and speeds.",

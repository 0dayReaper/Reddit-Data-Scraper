My friends would always give me a few bucks for miscellaneous supplies too so I eventually just tossed a jar up with \"booze money\" on it. It's not uncommon to have friends leave a bunch of beer for the shop as well. I have a standalone garage next to my house that I also but a bar in so it's a shop/bar combo. It's got a cypher lock and  security cameras which makes it so I can just let them use it when ever, just replace any consumables if you use a bunch. Never had an issue. System works great.",

It's a necessary component when \"tacking\", which is a maneuver used to steer against the wind by doing a kind of zig-zag. \n\nThe idiom, \"the cut of one's jib\", is a reference to naval warfare, when the \"cut\", or basic shape, of the forward sail could be used to approximate a distant vessel's allegiance: friend or foe. Telling someone you like the cut of their jib is a way of showing respect or approval for their character, especially if you are still getting acquainted.",

That's all BS.  It's never as black-and-white as people make it out to be.  When you're alone all the time you crave interaction with people.  When you're never alone at anytime you just want to be by yourself and away from everyone's stupid social calamities.  It's about maintaining that balance between the two extremes - always alone vs never alone.",

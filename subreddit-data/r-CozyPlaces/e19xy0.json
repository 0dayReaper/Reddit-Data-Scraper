            "comment": "Long story short, my mom had some medical issues last month that meant she could no longer live alone. I had to move her in with my family. I moved my son\u2019s bedroom to the basement as it was the biggest room available. His only request was to make it cozy. There\u2019s more pictures here: https://imgur.com/gallery/QKg4yn2\n\n\nI don\u2019t want him to feel slighted that we had to make room for grandma. What do you think?\n\nFront page edit: You guys are insane! ( and I mean that in a good manner ) We were going to surprise him on Wednesday; I never imagined this response from the community. My inbox is swamped - but I get the good feeling this post has elicited from the hive mind. The feedback has been awesome.  Thank you.\n\nFollow up Edit:  I wanted to do a follow up post; but after some reflection, decided against it. I want you to know he loved it  and was very appreciative of all the work his family put into it on his behalf. Best wishes for everyone during the upcoming holiday season. I sincerely hope everyone finds their own cozy place to ring in the New Year!",

Especially because  I have a lot of health problems and dont have good insurance, I am under their insurance currently.\n\nIm glad my parents are paying for stuff but they are using the money and emotionally manipulating me to never move out. They frequently tell me that they are \"requiring\" me to stay living at their house until they die. I agree to this just out of fear that they will stop paying for my college.\n\nThe more annoying part is they have set it up in a way where I need them, for example I dont know how to do my taxes among many other basic needs. I am trying to learn but a lot of the things I need to know i dont even know exist.",

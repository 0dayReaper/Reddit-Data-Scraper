It twines its way through the garden, eating cats and chasing the chickens. It cannot be killed. You lie awake at night, crying, thinking about the way its digging under the foundations of your house, and your very life\u2026..\n\n\nSrsly tho, its very pretty and smells nice. \n\n\nBut don\u2019t grow it in a climate when you don\u2019t get a hard frost in the winter or it will climb over your house and eat your children.",

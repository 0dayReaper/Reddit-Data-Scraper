For example I had a 14000 acre RX fire at the base of my mountain. During the day it would roar to life and the smoke stack would hit the stratosphere. But at night, the barometric pressure puts the fire to \"sleep\". That 14k fire was nearly invisible at night to the naked eye 3000 ft above it. But if I took a long exposure with my camera the fire was obviously putting out a lot of light.",

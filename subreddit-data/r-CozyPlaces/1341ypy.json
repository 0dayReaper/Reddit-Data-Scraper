Lived with my parent till 37 - bought this apartment when I was 39.\n\nCouldn't afford to buy until then.\n\nSo I have placed comfort over design - thrift finds and free stuff. My dining table is my grandfather's drafting table but the bar stools are from a fancy designer store \ud83d\ude04.\n\nAs for the art - my walls are covered in my apartment. Even my own art - and I have art that my dad did as well as my grandfather. Come from long line of dabblers \ud83d\udc4d",

I have a large poster in my bathroom - \u201cAfter the Bath, Woman Drying Herself\u201d by Degas that I bought at The National Gallery in London.\n\nThe cabinet was free-if-picked-up. It is a German made bar/vinyl player. It was in bad condition - peeling sides, missing speakers and the vinyl player and lights and the whole back of the cabinet was missing.  I had a back cut in thin plywood, painted the cabinet in light blue and used a stencil to make the pattern. It is now a bar/plant stand/speaker stand. I don\u2019t like painting if the wood can be saved, but in this case, it was the best option.",

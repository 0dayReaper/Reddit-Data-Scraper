I bought a ranch style. I have a wide galley kitchen and fat butlers pantry and every room is all separated out with doors. The dirt stays in the rooms where people enter. You can have multiple conversations and activities going on at once (those vaulted ceilings ensure that not only every person in every corner of the house can hear you shit, but that the neighbors probably can too). I can reach all the dust that accumulates. Swapping out fans for chandeliers didn't require a contractor and some shady ladder work. And in the summer when its 120 degrees outside (as it is every summer and over 100 for like 10 months of the year)... my concrete ranch style is cool as a cellar while my parents pay like 500/month to cool their glass bug box.\n\nThose LA type homes you see have their upsides and their downsides and after you've lived in one you want a space that has been vetted by 2000 years of humanity... not 50 of capitalist nightmare.",

However, it does go a lot further. We got about 750 square feet out of a single gallon. That\u2019ll change a bit depending on what color you\u2019re using and painting over, but it\u2019s quality stuff",

It can look really great, like in this kitchen, but sometimes you need to transfer items left-right on-off the range as you cook, or stir with one hand and pick up another ingredient to add with the other, etc. I see these enclosed ranges a lot but as nice as it looks, I just don't enjoy cooking as much with a set up like this.\n\nMy ideal set up is a single span with sink to the left, a decent amount of counter space (about 4 feet), range to the right, then additional countertop to the right of the range. It allows ease of movement between washing-chopping-adding to pots on the stove (water and garbage space -&gt; prep space -&gt; heat space).\n\nJust my two cents!",

I tried something similar at my house for Ms Minnie and it was wonderful until the raccoons had to come and check it out at night (when Minnie is inside) and tore up the screens to get in and out. I fixed them several times and they just made new ones. They smelled where I put the food bowl while kitty was outside, but always brought it inside with Minnie. Raccoons can drive you crazy and they get off while doing it. Such destructively brats! And are so cute!",

My mother didn't allow pets indoors, so my dad built a dog pen and screened in the top. He cut a tree to go from ground to ceiling and made a cat house on one of the branches.  He rolled up carpet to expand inside, to surround him for warmth. Each night, I could put my cat inside the pen and could sleep peacefully. It wasn't nearly this pretty or as big, but I was always thankful for the work he put into it.",

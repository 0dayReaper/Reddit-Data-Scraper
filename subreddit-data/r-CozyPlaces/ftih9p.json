It's awesome that I can get to NYC in 2 hours by train or bus whenever I want, without paying NYC cost of living. In Philly I can have almost all of the amenities of NYC but at a fraction of a cost, and I can live in a rowhome instead of an apartment.\n\nDon't care much for DC, it's okay, but it doesn't offer much that Philly doesn't. It's hotter, less dense, and more expensive. Good for an occasional visit but I'd much rather go to NYC (or Pgh!).\n\nI love the light rail in Pittsburgh though. The views going through the South Hills and over the rivers are amazing and it's such a pleasant ride.\n\nPittsburgh day-to-day life seems much calmer than in Philly, people are more friendly and there's more of a community feel in the neighborhoods. My girlfriend grew up in Pittsburgh so I've spent a lot of time there over the years.",

He ended up going to a private high school for classical percussion training and did his undergrad in something similar at the Boston Conservatory. He got his masters in music education and when he got out he was really disheartened by how hard the teaching jobs were to come by and how low the pay is.  When he told me he was thinking about going to teach in Japan I told him he couldn\u2019t do that. He is my best friend (so I can say this) he is musically gifted but traditional academics aren\u2019t really his strong suit. I wouldn\u2019t trust him to teach English to someone and learning a foreign language on top of that seemed crazy.  It was going to be sink very hard or maybe swim.  I thought he would be back home after his initial contract ended. \n\nObviously he proved me wrong but he\u2019s managed to climb the ladder.  First, he speaks perfect Japanese. This probably doesn\u2019t surprise anyone but, again, he wasn\u2019t an academic superstar, so I had my doubts. Immersion is a hell of a teacher. Second, and some of this importance is lost on me, but going from Kochi to Tokyo is a big deal. I guess it would be like getting a Teach for America position in rural Alabama and then getting one in Beverly Hills. Kochi and Tokyo are worlds apart and now he gets to enjoy the benefits of living in a big city (Kawasaki is very close by train).  Finally, he is now actually teaching music, which is his obvious passion. I believe he just got a new contract with a private school as it\u2019s music director, which for him has always been the end goal. He is getting paid really well now and loving life. He is (was?) actually due to come back home and get married this July. Hopefully the current circumstances don\u2019t sidetrack that...\n\nBut to make a long story short: I didn\u2019t expect him to make it six months and now it\u2019s been a decade. He\u2019s got a great job, in a great city, with a soon to be great wife. All thanks to rolling the dice with JET!",

Her doctor immediately told her they were just kotatsu burns and they would fade over the summer. They kinda had a marbling effect. Anyhow, they feel great. We eat at ours constantly so that our dog is on the couch while we're sitting on the floor. I'm usually never a napper, but I can nap so easily when I lay down under a kotatsu. It's a bit odd waking up from a nap in the winter covered in sweat.",

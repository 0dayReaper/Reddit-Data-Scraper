Hours and hours spent digging through all the different sections finding treasures. \n\nWe'd drop off used books at the front desk and wander for hours, and when you'd check out they would have them priced for you and you could sell them for credit towards your purchase.\n\n24 years later and I still think about this place often when I read the books I collected there. It's one of the few things I miss in that city.",

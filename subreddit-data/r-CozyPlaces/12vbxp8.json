We thanked them, apologized for the inconvenience, and started to leave when one of the ladies stopped us, found us a small table, and offered to pour us a slash or two. Very good wine, we thought, and hospitable, gracious staff. We bought a bottle on the way out. \n\nI've often found that, more often than not, being polite and understanding as a customer goes a long way with folks in the service industry and gets you an infinitely more satisfying experience.",

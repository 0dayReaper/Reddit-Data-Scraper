It's more volatile than water so it evaporates at a faster rate than the pool. You have to dump chlorine liquid and tablets in to keep it chlorinated enough to kill algae (otherwise your pool will become a swamp).\n\nSaltwater pools are slightly salty. They have chlorine generators that turns the salt floating around the pool into chlorine to kill algae. \n\nBasically salt is cheaper to make and safer to ship than chlorine, so it's like 1/5th the cost to maintain depending on your type of pool. That being said you need to have the chlorine generator and maintain it, so the costs are closer when you average everything out.",

For transparency: I've never owned a chlorine-only pool, just a salt water pool.\n\nA common misconception is that salt water pools don't contain chlorine (I used to think this too), but this isn't correct. Salt water pools contain a special salt and use something called a salt cell (or chlorinator) that breaks down the salt into chlorine. The result is the pool does contain chlorine, but usually it's less than a traditional chlorine-only pool because it's automatically maintained. In a chlorine-only pool, it's up to you to maintain the chlorine levels manually and keeping them consistent can be difficult.\n\nThe up-front cost of the equipment for a salt-water pool can be more expensive, but the chemicals required to maintain it (mostly just the salt) are usually less expensive (chlorine is pretty pricey) so over time it's more cost effective. There are other benefits as well, mainly being that the water has less chlorine so it's not as harsh on skin and clothes.\n\nJust like any pool, salt water pools can become chemically imbalanced due to sunshine, rain, swimmers, temperature, etc. It's even possible that at some point you might need to manually add chlorine to the pool directly. Some of it depends on your environment and where the pool is located.\n\nTo be honest, if you look online you can find some pretty differing opinions on which is better. I've included a couple examples below:\n\n- [FIXR Saltwater  vs  Chlorine Pool](https://www.fixr.com/comparisons/saltwater-vs-chlorine-pool#cQ)\n- [The Lowdown on Saltwater Pools vs. Chlorine Pools](https://www.riverpoolsandspas.com/blog/saltwater-vs-chlorine-pools-quick-lowdown)\n\nWe live in Texas and keep our pool open year-round (meaning we never \"close\" it by fulling draining it and sealing everything up for the winter). We just check the pool chemical levels periodically (like once a week) and make small adjustments when needed, which isn't very often. Rarely we might need to add something called \"shock\" to remove excess algae but if the salt cell is working then the chlorine will take care of it.\n\nIn my opinion, a salt water pool is easier to maintain which makes it more \"useable\" since we're not constantly worried about chemicals. If I had to build a new pool I'd probably go with salt water again.",

If the pool cost $30,000 between putting it in, maintenance/repair costs, the higher water bill, etc. etc., and if you swam in it 100 times a year for all 30 years (which is quite a lot but not super unreasonable, especially here in Arizona, as that covers all of summer and a little on either end), it would end averaging $10 in cost for every time you swam in it.\n\nOf course, the overall cost could be less than that or quite a bit more, depending on how you financed its construction, how big it is, if any of the necessary repairs end up being expensive, and so on. But that really put things into perspective, because there was of course no way that it actually ended up being used 100 times a year consistently for 30 straight years, and so it's likely quite a bit higher than $10 per use average. Even still, thinking now as someone shopping for a home, if I were to ask myself if I would be willing to pay $10 each time I wanted to use my public community pool, I'd of course say no, because it wouldn't be worth it at all. But if I had the option of a \"free\" community pool (paid for through the HOA dues, but calling it free since I wouldn't be able to opt out of paying that portion of the HOA cost by not using the pool, so the cost is going to be there either way) or the option of my own private pool that I had to pay $10+ to use every time, the community pool seems like a much better option.\n\nThis all ignores the fact that the home resale value goes up by having a pool, so you get some of the cost back, but either way, having a pool is much, *much* more expensive than I would have thought, especially in relation to how often it will end up being used.",

This was then [mounted on a height-adjustable table frame](https://www.tectake.ch/de/tischgestell-elektrisch-hohenverstellbar-memory-funkt-extra-breit-110-190x68x58-123cm-800664).\n\n\\- Monitor: [Apple Studio Display](https://www.apple.com/studio-display/)\n\n\\- [Mouse/Desk Pad: Balolo](https://www.balolo.de/en/products/desk-pad)\n\n\\- [Laptop Vertical Stand](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0B5H6VNHX?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)\n\nThe [wallpaper is from basicappleguy](https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/os-x-rancho-cucamonga) , who makes a lot of very nice [wallpapers](https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/category/Wallpaper).\n\nThe rest is then more or less from Ikea.\n\nI hope you like it and if you have any questions, let me know.",

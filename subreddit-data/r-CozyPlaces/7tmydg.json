Figure it\u2019s difficult to find a half acceptable place to live at $1500 (requires roommates) and even that would imply an income of more than $60k assuming you spend 35% of your gross pay (I.e. before tax) on annual rent.  (I estimate most people pay approx 40% of gross pay on rent).  It hurts my heart to think how people must be living to afford anything near the city.\n\nEdit: by gross I meant BEFORE tax, not after tax as I first stated.",

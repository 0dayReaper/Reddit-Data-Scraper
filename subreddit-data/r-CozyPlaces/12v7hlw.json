I don\u2019t really use it as much of a living room since I have no couch and my cozy chair is in a bit of a tight spot (I have an old rustic chair and a bench in there that I use when I\u2019m packing a bag or  putting my shoes on).\n\nThat said - I dust, sweep and vacuum this room, but I don\u2019t do much else!",

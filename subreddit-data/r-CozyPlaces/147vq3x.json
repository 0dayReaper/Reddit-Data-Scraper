It only cost me 10 bucks at goodwill, so if it does mold I'll likely just replace it with an outdoor rug. The other rug is an indoor/outdoor, but it's clear that the areas that get more sun are starting to color fade. I have a shade that blocks some sun, and most of the hangings are synthetic materials and don't appear to have faded at all. With the exception of the canvas on the left, which is an original artwork and some of the background red has bled out.",

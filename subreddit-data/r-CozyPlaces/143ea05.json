Definitely gives a more immersive experience when watching tv. Didn't really notice until I was watching something with him and he briefly turned off the backlights--all of a sudden the tv in a dark room seemed so...empty? Like it was missing something. I would definitely recommend the dreamview to anyone reading this, but the Govee brand in general is great and affordable for other home lighting, too.",

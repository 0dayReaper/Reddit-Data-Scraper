It's the chairs that fuck up your back because you are staying locked in the same position for hours on end. Staying mobile is so much better for your entire body and being on the floor having the room to be in any position that feels good at the moment is soooo much better for your body. \n\nI think its a mindset with all the people saying \"my back!\" Because they think you'll be sitting in that same position it's in right now and they don't realize that the laptop and desk are mobile and you can lean back, sit up, stretch your legs out, sit crossed legged, lay on your belly on the floor, bend forward, etc. And you move between these positions &amp; more over the course of even an hour and keeping yourself mobile on the floor. \n\nFloor supremacy!",

I've been struggling to find a comfortable office chair that doesn't hurt my back and I never really thought about just ditching it entirely even though I've always felt more comfortable on the floor anyway. Social norms keeping me back instead of listening to what my body needs. Maybe I should find some shorter legs for my desk and just ditch the chair to stay more mobile. My spouse always makes fun of me because I can't sit in a chair normally...when I've been naturally sitting in the positions in the first video just IN MY CHAIR like a crackhead lmao and I switch between these positions often to help relieve the pressure on my back. It would be so much easier to do it on the floor \ud83d\ude02\n\nI don't think I could move entirely to a smaller desk like they have in the videos though as I have two monitors and a full gaming PC and I like the space to spread out so maybe finding a way to shorten the legs on the desk will be my best option. (Plus I JUST BOUGHT this desk less than a couple years ago and it still feels too new to get rid of lol",

It's definitely not something I do full time but I am trying to do more often. I feel like it does strengthen core muscles because you aren't slouched and fully relaxed so much but muscles are more activated. Maybe try to just start incorporating it slowly? I have seen [cool chairs](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CkjaupcKnKU/?igshid=Mzc1MmZhNjY=) that mimic this for people who like having a desk but it is a little pricey. Hope you find something that works good for you \u263a\ufe0f",

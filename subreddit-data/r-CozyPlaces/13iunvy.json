Three of my major furniture pieces here were dumped in the streets of NYC, and with a bit of sanding, stain or paint, they\u2019re like new and 10X better and cozier than anything you can buy brand new. \n\nI refuse to buy new furniture after having sold nearly everything before moving to NYC and 95% of my apartment is found outside, thrifted, or purchased second-hand.",

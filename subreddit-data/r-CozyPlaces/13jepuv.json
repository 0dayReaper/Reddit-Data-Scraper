The seat cushions are still nice and firm, no grooves and the back cushions are great and don\u2019t sag. The frame is solid, no movement or squeaks. The fabric doesn\u2019t show any signs of wear. It\u2019s got down on the filling, and it\u2019s  very comfy but  former  cushion. This is with my husband and I and a small dog using it. It\u2019s positively lovely. \n\nI had intended the upstairs living room to remain the nice room, while the basement was to have a family room. That didn\u2019t exactly pan out yet lol\n\nI\u2019m planning to sell it, maybe for the reduced cost of that plus shipping would be a solution for you?  I\u2019m looking at a couple of sectionals.

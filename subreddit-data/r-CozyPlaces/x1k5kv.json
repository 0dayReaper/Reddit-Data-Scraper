I didn't mean to come across any other way in my original comment either, so I'm sorry for that",

Most of the art is made by myself, my friends, or are prints I have a connection to. There are some found objects of significance as well. The furniture is nearly all vintage/secondhand, mixed in with some new lighting, pillows, and other small objects from my travels. My most prized find is the authentic Wassily chair, found at an office building liquidation sale. The fiddle leaf fig has been with me since 2018. It was about 2ft tall when I got it, and it\u2019s now over 11ft!\n\nRent is $1,200 for the whole space, which I share with a roommate ($600 each). It's a steal considering how beautiful and big both bedrooms are. My room isn't fully photographed yet, but I'll probably post something soon.\n\nEdit: y\u2019all are so incredibly kind and encouraging. thank you all! &lt;3",

For historical racial discrimination reasons these line up with geographic lines referred to as The L and The Butterfly, life in The L is basically the same as any other city with a slightly higher crime rate (but still you chances of being the victim of a crime are very low) and very cheap compared to other cities, my wife and I used to rent a 2 bedroom 1500 sq ft apartment with a backyard for $1375/mo. The L is very walkable and bikeable and has ok but not great public transportation. There is tons of stuff to do and free museums and parks all over the place. The Butterfly is more nuanced, there are good parts of The Butterfly but also all the worst parts of the city are in the butterfly, there is generally less to do and the public transportation is notoriously terrible in this part.\n\nYou can see the L vs the Butterfly in [this map of population change](https://bniajfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Pop-Change-Map-2010-to-2020.jpg) the blue section running north south in the middle is the L, the red wings to each side of it are the Butterfly",

We didn't go out a ton, so being close to night life wasn't a high priority.\n\nI liked Parkville the best because it was pretty relaxed and an easy shot along the river to downtown. Overland Park was a mess of traffic to get much of anywhere, whether it was surface streets or the highways.",

Definitely check out Monarch Coffee in midtown, they create some amazing espresso based drinks with a level of care and sophistication you generally only see in a fancy cocktail bar. Messenger Coffee in crossroads is also great. Its a three story cafe with great coffee and a ton of amazing pastries and bread. When we're not facing a global pandemic, you can watch them bake on the first floor, go up to the second story to see them roast the coffee, or head on up to the third floor where they have seating on the roof with great views of the KC skyline.\n\nOther great coffee places in KC that I enjoy frequenting include wild way, oddly correct, thou mayest, and filling station.",

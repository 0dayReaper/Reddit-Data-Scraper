In the spring/summer when it reaches 60+F, I like to take it out to the balcony for a couple hours occasionally for some direct sun. Did this in our other unit before we moved to this one with a slightly different exposure: [other unit\u2019s balcony with plants](https://www.reddit.com/r/malelivingspace/comments/onszd2/need_more_plants/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_term=1)\n\nIf you zoom in closely, you can see the tip of a new frond emerging between the left and middle fronds. I\u2019m giving it some direct light to encourage more growth after a very long winter and a relocation. We have a bedroom balcony that is a lot more sheltered and I\u2019ll probably have the BoP there occasionally for direct sun this summer when it\u2019s too breezy in the main balcony.",

When they are uncovered, I just let rain do its thing. They seem to dry pretty rapidly during the months I use them, and the secret that non-Seattle folks don\u2019t know about is that\u2026it rarely rains in the summer: it\u2019s three months of little to no precipitation and warm but not hot (or humid).",

Dad threw a party where all his friends came over and we all played black ops together as it snowed heavily outside all night. Midway thru they all left to drive in the snow and pickup my siblings. I played and ate all the snacks and food until they got back lol. This was in Atlanta in 2010. Ill never forget that day either!",

Upon impact, the fine white powder bursts into the air and then elegantly drifts back down, gently and elegantly coating the scuffed off-white industrial vinyl flooring below.",

            "comment": "Winter is a challenging time of year. Dark. Cold. Maybe slippery and dangerous. \n\nYou never quite get used to it, that darkness. It's dark when you wake up, dark when you go outside to get to work, and dark when you make your way home. You have to bulk up in layers and layers of clothes,  and just about everything seems more of a struggle.\n\nThen, if you're lucky, the first snow comes (if not for global warming). I love watching people experience their first snowfall in life. Especially adults. That childlike excitement is not just about the sheer beauty of the falling flakes, dancing across the sky and gently landing on the street. It's the relief that, finally, your surroundings will look a bit less gloomy. A bit less dreadful. It changes you profoundly. \n\nIt opens up a whole new world of joyful opportunity; building snowmen, sleigh riding, snowball fights, the silent contemplation on a crisp winter morning walk, golden hour photography...\n\nUntil then, you learn to maximize the in-betweens. Setting up a table of candles or tea lights. A cup of warming beverages like tea, hot chocolate, coffee and something sweet to eat. Warm woolly sweaters, mittens, coats and hats. Hugs from people or a pet. Maybe, if you're lucky, a fireplace. Not to mention cheerful string of fairy lights or the embrace of a warm bed to climb back into on the weekends.\n\nThen the climax of Christmas morning, the explosion of colour on New Year's Eve and knowing that finally, finally at long last the darkest days are behind you and the light of spring will once more greet you before long. Just hold on.\n\nThank you OP for sharing. It's already getting darker in the morning here but your post has made me actually look forward to this winter.",

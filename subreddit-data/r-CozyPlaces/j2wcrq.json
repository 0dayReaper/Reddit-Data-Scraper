We are legally allowed to run only so many hours a day and per week, it works out to an average of 8.5 hours a day unless we take a 34 hour break and then reset the clock and yeah it's complicated let's not worry about it for now.\n\nTeam driving means just that, you've got two guys in the truck who rotate and can get stuff moved at double the speed if let's say the load takes two complete driving shifts to deliver. A team can run it straight through. A solo has to do one drive shift, park it for 10 hours and do the other drive shift.\n\nThe other reason for double bunks is a bit more insidious. \n\nSee, the cost to ensure a newbie trucker is very high. For the most part only the largest trucking companies can do that, the guys like CR England, CRST, Knight/Swift and so on. There are better companies that you can start out in that cherry pick fresh guys with particularly good records coming in...Prime, Maverick, TMC, Roehl are examples if you already have a solid work history for trucking and a good normal driving record.\n\nTo make a new trucker, first thing is they've got to get their commercial driver's license. But the second step is that, once they get hired on with a company that hires newbies, they are put on the road for on average about a month with an experienced driver to basically finish out their training and teach them how to live on the road. And how to actually do the job, such as checking in with shippers and receivers and all that crap.\n\nSo why did I call this insidious? Well, the worst of the starter companies like CRST have turnover rates that have to be seen to be believed. As in more than 100% per year...most folks don't last a year with some of these asshole outfits.\n\nCR England for example will try to get you to be a road trainer when you've got as little as 4 months experience.  That's batshit insane, you've got newbies teaching newbies. Basically, they're constantly teaching new people so quickly that it's kind of like the Sith: \"always two there are, master...and apprentice!\" as Yoda put it.\n\nAt any one moment, so many of their trucks are in use as training trucks that they buy every single one of them with two beds. Not even fucking kidding.\n\nNow that said, if you pick the right company, a thousand a week is very plausible. And if you've gotten into it young with low to no debt, you can save up 300 bucks a week for those first two years before the cost to insure you drops dramatically and you can join a smaller, cooler company.\n\nAt 300 bucks a week for 2 years, you've saved up about $30k. If you study how these trucks work, and you make the right pick on Craigslist at that point, you can get a good used truck for about $20k, with $10K as you're starting maintenance fund.  You don't want to start your own trucking company at that point, you want to get hired on as an owner operator with some other existing company that can only hire somebody with at least 2 years experience because again that's when the insurance cost dropped.\n\nAnd at that point, making three grand a week just in general freight is easy and a lot more if you want to do something specialized, especially if it involves either hazmat or heavy haul if you went the flatbed route.\n\nLet me give you one more tip that you will need at the 2-year mark. How do you pick a good small cool company that won't screw you?\n\nHeh. Ok.  Pay attention 'cuz it took me WAY to long to figure THAT out.\n\nI book my own loads off of the DAT load board - in other words, I work the spot market. Don't worry about that, you'll learn about it later.  When I call a freight broker answering one of their advertised loads, before we discuss price or pick up and delivery time and all that crap, that broker wants my MC number - Motor Carrier, usually six digits.  Googling for the MC number of any trucking company is pretty easy. The broker will take about 30 seconds to run my MC number past databases that he subscribes to such as carrier411 or Freightguard to find out if my company has a shitty reputation or not. He can also tell how long we've been business and what our credit rating is. If your company has a shitty reputation he'll have to tell you that and hang up or he'll just flat out hang up on you. Been there, done that when I signed up with the wrong goddamn company.\n\nThe outfit I'm with now has an excellent MC number and when I give that number to a broker they are happy to talk to me.\n\nTQL is probably the biggest broker. CH Robinson is huge too. Coyote Logistics and XPO are also fair sized. Google for their phone numbers, get to one of their brokers during a slow time (mid-week after 2pm central or so) and when you navigate the phone tree to a human to book a load, be honest and tell them you're a trucker who is thinking about hiring on to a particular company, you have their MC number and you'd like them to run it real quick to tell you if that company is okay from their point of view.\n\nDo it twice.\n\nThat's basically telling you what their business ethics are like. If they treat brokers, shippers and recievers okay, they are very likely to treat you okay and they're going to have a very easy time booking loads and either keeping you busy if you're being dispatched, or making your process of finding and booking a load easy if you go the self dispatched route like I do.\n\nI have to stay in general freight because my wife is disabled, rides with me and I frequently have to get her home for doctor's visits and such so I need maximum load flexibility.\n\nOne overall plan is, two years as a newbie, four or five running your own truck balls out making $3k to $5k a week (after all expenses and a $500/wk maintenance fund), do a business degree online during that time, come out with a bunch of cash and buy your own small business. Take that old truck, rip out one of the rear axles, turn it into a killer RV :).\n\nOR, back it down to one week on, one week off, semi retire so to speak, have a life.\n\nWhat I don't recommend is staying a company driver at $1,500-$2k a week your whole life. Nope.\n\nIf you're gonna do it, go big.",

Smaller shippers and receivers won't be set up for a very long time so I think there's going to be a very long transition period.\n\nThey transition WILL happen, yeah, but there's absolutely enough time to do the kind of get in, make big money and get out program I recommend for somebody younger over the course of six to eight years or so.\n\nYou don't want to do this your whole life unless you've got some other side thing going on that you can run from within the truck and you really end up liking this shit :).",

Loads that can spoil have a \"reefer\", basically turns the trailer into a refrigerator and/or freezer. Bunks are for either team or a ride along. Teams make it a quicker run, means more money and more work (because you get the load to its destination sooner) nothing else.\n\nEdit: I would like to add that it might not just be the driver if something spoils. The reefer unit could go bad, but the driver should always be paying attention. If they are then they can catch it in time to have it fixed before the load spoils. Frozen loads are more prone to spoilage, especially in the summer.",

It also depends on whether you work for a company or buy your own truck. I work for a company and have been driving for four years. My check this week was $1600. And that's after paying $700 in taxes and SS. It can pay well but you have to want to do the job. It's a lonely lifestyle and can get very tiring driving 10+ hours a day 7 days a week. But if you can deal with the lifestyle it's definitely worth it.",

Which isn't as bad as it sounds. Most of the showers are really nice and very private and free if you fuel at the right places. \n\nYou have to have the patience to sometimes sit for hours getting loaded and unloaded.  Some places I've sat for 8, 10, 12 hours waiting. And you have to want to drive and deal with traffic and people who resent you being on the same road as them just because you are big and slow. \nBut, having the animals in the truck with you helps. I have two cats that ride with me. They are both true trucker cats. They have been with me since they were six weeks old and the truck is their home. It's all they know. \n\nYou have to find ways to pass the time. I have listened to hundreds of audio books during the past four years and have a laptop and a hotspot that I use for gaming when I am sitting. It's a definite lifestyle that you have to get used to and make it your own. \n\nBut, to me, it's worth it, I  make damn good money . I don't have any bills. No car or insurance. All the money I make goes straight into the bank and sits there. To me it's worth it. \nBut my kids are grown and I haven't got a wife waiting at home for me so I have the time and luxury if being able to stay out for weeks or months at a time.",

Back in 2011, the car I was in got into a collision with one on some icy roads in northern Michigan. We were all fine as the taurus took the hit (or hits, as the trailer slammed into us as well) pretty damn well.\n\nThe driver came sprinting across the road after he'd pulled over to make sure we were okay. He was a good dude and was obviously very happy to see we were all in one piece.\n\nI should add, it was not his fault that we collided. The driver of my vehicle was going far too fast for conditions and lost control. Suffice to say he's now a very careful (and terribly slow) driver.",

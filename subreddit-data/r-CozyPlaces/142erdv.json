So as a Tucsonan, I have to hype it.\n\nWe have cozy patios like this all over and sunsets like this almost everyday. The Mexican food is some of the best outside of the actual country. Visit during November-March to be comfortable - Feb begins the wildflower season.  If extreme heat is your thing (for some people it is) the heights of July and August can reach 115+. July-Sept is our amazing monsoon season where the desert springs back to life and the creosote fills the air. Besides the weird Sonoran Desert that we live in, we also have mountains that are part of the Sky Island system. There's a ton of flora and fauna here that you won't find anywhere else in the world.\n\nWe also have a VERY robust artistic tradition.  Lots of lovely architecture, murals, sculptures, and all sorts of public art is everywhere. I think someone here posted the Lazlo mural, which is a perfect example. Come visit. Have some carne asada and enjoy the dry heat! We also really don't care how you're dressed.",

What was once black is now a pale grey. \n\nAnd because it's an obvious question, I stopped bringing it in myself just out of principle. And a healthy bit of spite - she's the one that uses it, and there have been a couple of times she's wanted to lay out there but it rained the previous day. Still hasn't brought it in though!",

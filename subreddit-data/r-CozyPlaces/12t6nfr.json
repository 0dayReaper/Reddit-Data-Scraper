Forgive me, but every time I post pics of my space i get all kinds of snark and bile. Your question \"does it not rain there\"? Immediately made me paint you as a snark barker. Maybe you just didn't understand that I was saying that because the fabric is nylon it is unlikely to absorb much rain or dilute the color. The sun might fade it, but I am not worried about the rain. Forgive me if that was unclear from my post.",

Those red lights are from that and they are just regular red led christmas lights. The bistro lights are RGB, but regular plug in lights. The lights on the umbrella are solar and the various hanging lamps I have around the space are solar. You just plug this stuff in and hang it up. It's super easy to achieve this kind of look.\n\nEdit - Thanks!",

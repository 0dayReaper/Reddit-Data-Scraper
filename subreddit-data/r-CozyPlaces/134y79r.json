Then I wrapped it in terrazzo contact paper, which I got from lowes. There's lots of cool contact paper options, especially on Amazon, to get a natural stone look without the weight/price.\n\nIt requires some tools and work, but you can make yourself something really useful, custom, and cheap compared to prefab tops. And then I got motorized desk legs, so I have a rising/lowering desk set up for less than $200. Something like this from ikea would be at least 300, and I'd argue this looks nicer.",

Because the room might not have been to everyone's taste, the OP was bullied into deleting their post *and* their account. \n\nLet us make it perfectly clear . . . **THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE!**\n\nThe first rule of this sub (and Reddit in general) is [remember the human](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyPlaces/wiki/index#wiki_rule_1_-_community_policy_.28remember_the_human.29). A LOT of you forgot that yesterday and it's not good enough.\n\nWe will be a lot more liberal with the ban hammer from now on. Nasty, bullying or outright rude comments get a permanent ban. There will be no warning. \n\nIf you can't play nice then we can't either.",

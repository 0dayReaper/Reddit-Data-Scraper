The lack of it apparently triggers the wild spread of Dandelion",

I always think that's just so much soil weight, and it must increase exponentially when wet which must happen quite often.\n\nBut they're so beautiful!

Not sure of the English term) but we used a sort of plastic membrane sheet with drainage channels over the structural layer the soil/sod over that.\n\nThe ones I helped build are now about 35 years old and going strong.",

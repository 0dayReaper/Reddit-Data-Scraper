We do alot of work in Breckenridge, Vail, Aspen etc. It may get slightly colder by a room full of windows like this but not enough to make you uncomfortable. \n\nThis is a higher end bathroom and looks pretty new. There is this spray foam insulation they use on these houses now (think ghost busters 2 slime guns) it is incredibly efficient. Alot of these homes will have the spray foam as well as blown in insulation, they also typically have radiant heated floors and most certainly have a central air system...all of which im sure help with keeping things toasty\n\nSometimes they won't have A/C because you hardly ever need it a that elevation but heat is essential.",

We had dual HVAC and our bedroom was so poorly insulated and the windows so poorly installed that it could get down to the 50s in the winter. I wish I knew how to pick a better house this upcoming time because that place was hell. \n\n(I've seen a few \"higher end\" remodels in that city that were also done by bad flippers and not much better than ours.)",

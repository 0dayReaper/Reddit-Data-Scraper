We ordered over 100 small souvlakis with greek salad (big family) almost every night. A couple times we lived at hotel Alexandria with owner Jimmy. This is a time where all roads expect the main road (straight line for about 10km) had asphalt. All gravel roads also the \"center\" square. South of the main road was mostly olives and peaches trees. Now there are appartments all over. Skala hotel was not built yet.\n\nThere was a legendary beach bar called Captains Table. Ask about it. It was absolutely fantastic! \n\nIn Kassandria we had to go into the telephone \"store\" to make calls every friday as this is planned before we left. Market every week was fantastic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah, memories. Although i was in Fourka beach it is very close to this place.  I know we were there one time.",

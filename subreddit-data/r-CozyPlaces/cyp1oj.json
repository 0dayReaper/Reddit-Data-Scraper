In the Sierra Nevada in summer, if it's clear skies when you go to sleep (when you'd want the fly off), quite good odds it'll stay that way overnight.  Granted the Sierra does have the most benign weather of the major US ranges.",

So I can totally see having the fly on if in camp in those conditions.  But can't recall a time in my summers in the range when a clear sky at sunset turned to rain overnight, given that most all of the summer rainstorms are driven by the energy of the sun.",

I fell out three times consecutively, rolling in the mud, and my body felt really awkward because my shoulders and knees never really fit inside. \n\nThat being said, it was definitely something I would do all over again, and can\u2019t recommend it enough.",

(A drip line is what we call it)\n\nAlso, make sure the rain fly (Basha) is tight and won't let water pool, if water pools and it touches the bug net or hammock that allows a path for the water to enter and once water gets in the hammock it's game over.\n\nIt took two wet nights before I figured it out, but I've since managed to sleep dry in a hammock during a pretty heavy rainstorm, it was fun to wake up and see a few inches of water running through the campsite and still be dry.\n\nOh and make sure you're laying diaganolly, not in line with the trees, that'll give you a more flat sleeping position and a bit more space. It's possible that the hammock was just too small though.",

I had bites on my face and he was fine! Wtf lol\n\n\nEdit: yes it was only one bed bug. We bought a new bed frame and I found the fucker as we were putting the mattress in the frame and I never had a bite again.",

Anything to keep the body heat in when you're up high/cold is a good thing.\n\nYou're right about mountain weather. I keep it on pretty much anywhere I camp outside of the desert. The momentary full view before I head to bed isn't worth having to scramble to put it on in a freak rainstorm in the middle of the night.\n\nAlso of note, that's a big-ass tent if the photog hiked in. Probably not built for warmth in the first place.",

My main winter one is a Terra Nova Super Quasar, but I also have a Lightwave T20 Hyper which is much much lighter than the Quasar, but way cooler in winter, particularly in strong winds, even though they both have solid panel inners.  I'd always assumed a mesh inner would be way too cold for winter, but would be interested to hear how you get on as the poor airflow of panels does have its drawbacks.\n\nThe T20 Hyper is unreal for the weight, but not being geodesic like the Quasar, it's a bit hit or miss on snow/ice sometimes. Quasar is bombproof. \n\n(Mostly camp up high in Scottish Highlands).",

There are so many more humane options than resorting to lethality.  Not to mention that if you have a long-gun, you basically get one shot.  Black bears are not a problem, I will not say the same thing about grizzlies or god forbid polar bears (agreed that shotguns would be necessary for polar bears).  I've dealt with plenty of black bears and they're just skittish.  The only thing is that they're probably curious about the smell, and if you're with a group of people they're probably just going to waddle off anyway.  Solo, keep a bear banger and/or spray and you'll be a-ok with black bears.  Grizzlies, bearspray will work on and you just have to be more safe with your food/food prep.  \n\n\nTo be quite honest, I'm far more scared of someone packing heat when I'm backpacking, and no amount of 'good guy with a gun' is going to change that opinion for me.",

It's in the Buffalo Peaks Wilderness Area near Fairplay. It's in a designated wilderness area (no vehicles). The loop is a long day-hike but the best way to enjoy it is to hike in and set up your camp and stay for a week. You can then thoroughly explore the area and enjoy the fantastic scenery without the crowds. It's a 12 mile loop at from 10,000 to 12,000 feet. Best time to go is July and August. On weekends you'll get a little through traffic but if you camp away from the trails you'll never see anyone.\n\n* Watch deer and elk feed in the  willows morning and evening. \n\n* Watch the coyotes chase the deer and elk.\n\n* Climb the buffalo peaks.\n\n* Watch the beavers tend to their dam and lodge.\n\n* Fish for trout and have a fresh meal.\n\n* See the sky at night as you've never seen it before.\n\nMy brother and I have done all of these things and much more on our annual trek to this incredible area.\n\n[Google pictures](https://www.google.com/search?q=rich+creek+trail+loop&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi839HfgLPkAhUlh-AKHerfBr4Q_AUIEigC&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950)",

Here in the states we can only rent flats unless we are purchasing the building to rent out to others but we aren't actually living in it ourselves.\n\nWhen we rent a flat we do not own it. How do you purchase a flat in Europe??? Does that mean it's actually yours? Or do you still have a landlord?",

I think that's where Americans get confused. Flats can be owner-occupied or owned and rented to someone else.  Generally the whole building is owned by someone/a company and various people own the individual homes within the building. There is usually some maintenance charges to pay to the owner of the overall building but the individual homes are sold and owned individually.\n\nAm I right in thinking, in America, it's common for a person to own a whole block of apartments and rent them out individually? That's not a thing here.",

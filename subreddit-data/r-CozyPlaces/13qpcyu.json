I was lucky because my local \u201cbox\u201d store had an offer that if you bought it for $499 they gave you a $200 gift card so I basically paid to $299 for it! I went on to buy an additional thermal cover, which is tremendous. It protects the tub and saves on energy. I put down half inch mats, like yoga puzzle mats. This keeps the bottom safe and also saves on energy and makes it soft. I love it. It was worth every penny. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll last, but I take very good care of it because it takes very good care of me lol.",

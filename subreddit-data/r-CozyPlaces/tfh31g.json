The TV itself is fine and the image pretty good for an early 4k entry, but everything on it started going wonky pretty quickly.  The remote only works to power on and off, and the pointer function has near permanent drift.  The apps crash constantly, and the UI now operates at a snail's pace.  Now I just use it as a TV only, and everything else is controlled through external inputs.  I'm glad I didn't pay anywhere near the original $6k price tag.",

Figure out what you will be using your tv for, and then pick the best tv in your budget. \n\nI would highly recommend against mounting over the fireplace for 2 reasons. First, tvs do not do well with heat. Having a tv above a fireplace will ruin the TV in the short term at worst, and greatly reduce the life of your tv at best. Also usually mounting a tv above a fireplace is wayyyy too high. The middle of the screen should be at eye level when you are seated.",

The UI isn't my favorite and it is noticeably slower on the processing side of things compared to an Nvidia shield or a console. But it's a solid C+ TV without a streaming device and a B+ with one. \n\nThe main draw is the artwork, which you usually have to buy, or you have a limited selection of them. But if you get a frame for the TV, which is honestly way harder than it should be, then the artwork looks stemless and it blends in better than any hidden tv and whatnot. It took 2 weeks to get the TVs in and 6 months for a frame (and cancelled the 2nd frame because best buy quoted another 6 months for one in late 2020).",

It's a gas fireplace so there isn't an actual chimney behind the sheet drywall so it was just as easy mounting it anywhere else. The one issue that I have is that there isn't an easy way to hide the one wire that leads to the one connect box. Because it's above the fireplace I can't just feed the wire down behind the drywall. I would have to feed it horizontally and past a stud in order to feed it down to where the one box currently sits.\n\nFor now I am just living with the one wire being visible but may try a better way to hide it in the future",

It is *two* separate parts parts basically 0 adjustment so you gotta be dead on. But if you only have to do one it's not too bad.",

The 70's vintage box with a detached garage usually has a narrow split entryway with kitchen/bedrooms upstairs and living space downstairs. This is the type we saw a lot of when house shopping. The other, newer type usually has an attached garage in front and a little more space. Sometimes it's a tri level, sometimes it's a true split. Often I've seen these have walkouts. It's probably more livable than the older version but I would still pick a rambler over it. Stairs all day every day to get anywhere are killer.",

I literally run up and down the main stairs about 100 times per day.  We just had a conversation about opening up the 4th level loft and creating a sunken living room look for the 3rd level.  It's a love/ hate relationship with the house.  It's too quirky to just level and restart (though it would probably be cheaper/easier)",

You can\u2019t do that with a split level.\n\nSplit levels are fine if it\u2019s a new build because you can just put everything where you want, but there\u2019s a reason they\u2019re harder to sell because not everyone wants the same layout as you.",

Your aunt's place is not nearly depressing and muted enough to read as 70s to me, authentic though it may be.\n\nMy great aunt had a bathroom she had done in 1954 and never changed (except to update plumbing). I was utterly fascinated with the flocked wallpaper. Probably toxic, but I loved to stroke it.",

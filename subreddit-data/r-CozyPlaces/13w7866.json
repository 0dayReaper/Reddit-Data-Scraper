I think these cabins are the definition of cozy",

I guess I\u2019m used to being right up against a neighbor. And everyone was very quiet and kept to themselves. \n\nThe only place we had an issue with neighbors being loud and obnoxious was when camping at Fremont Peak State Park and the people next to us partied all night and had a barking dog and a crying newborn\n\nYour cabin is adorable and much cuter than the ones at Big Sur though",

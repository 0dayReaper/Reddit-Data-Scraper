I'm currently renovating and was really happy with how my study area was looking- sitting down it definitely feels more 'cozy' and it's where I feel comfort and relaxation :) I'd attribute that to having natural lighting and a harmonious color scheme, and having more open space makes me feel a bit more free. \n\nBut I see where you're coming from! It's not conventionally cozy in the sense of 'warm and fuzzy', but I personally find my little corner to give me that inner cozy feeling :)",

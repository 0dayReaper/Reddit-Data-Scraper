For example, my old apartment in Washington DC had a full window IN my bathtub, it was a tiny bathroom in a pre-war building, the only outward-facing wall in the bathroom was tubside. Apparently there's some law about a certain number of windows in units, I don't recall exactly what the issue was but it was definitely weird and made no sense.",

It doesn't mean you just roll over and accept your fate you just start setting your own goals. Someone will always have more, someone else will always have less. Don't become one of those people who love telling bad news about others. I'm sure a lot of us know someone like that.",

Reddit, Instagram, and social media in general make it very easy to compare the worst of our own lives to the best of other people. I see this a lot with people your age, to be honest - what you see on the internet is not indicative of real life. It's either the product of a lot of time and money, or a once in a lifetime thing. OP said they're realizing a life long dream. It takes time to get to that point. \n\nOne thing that I think is important is that you choose your yardstick carefully. If you're measuring yourself by the wrong metrics, you're going to disheartened and you're not going to see the progress you've made. In this instance - you're 24. You've been an adult for 6 years, and you came from a crappy childhood, base on your profile. You're doing good work to get yourself to a place where you can have this kind of success, make these kinds of posts - but that doesn't happen overnight. \n\nTangentially, I see from your posts that you want a career in helping people. That's great! First thing you have to do is learn to help yourself, and you're not going to do that by measuring yourself against someone who's life is completely different than yours, by any meaningful standard. Miley Cyrus was born almost exactly two years to the day after I was. It was a weird kick in the teeth to see just how much more valuable she was at 16 than I probably ever will be - but that's ok, because I'm living my life based on a standard of success that takes into account that I wasn't born to a musical powerhouse. Social media makes it very easy to measure ourselves by other people's standards, and that's not fair to us. Success is not defined by anyone but yourself.\n\nI hope that helps some.",

But just so you know, pine knots eventually dry up and fall out. There's a fair amount of caulking to do on a biannual basis. Or at least there was.\n\n I rather enjoyed that particular job. My sisters would be raking the leaves, putting bulbs in the flower beds, and mowing, but I got to climb the ladders spreading caulk in all of the cracks in the logs. I actually volunteered to load up the firewood boxes just so I could be the one to \"get\" to do that job! Crazy how I didn't raise my kids to be better with their chores.",

We put in a new stove and chimney this past spring and the building code in our province for the stove to be certified requires the chimney to be higher than the peak. I dont know all the details which is why we hired a qualified professional, but you may want to double check things for yourself.\n\nAlso, depending on how much snow you get, you might want extra bracing on the chimney. When the snow flies down the peak it will smack into the chimney.",

It is so simple buy eye-catching, perfect for my minimalist heart.   \n\n\nAnd that looks like the best dog in the world.",

I do use it often, but not always for traditional mediation. \n\nI actually convinced a random craigslist seller to sell me the art when I'd came for something else. It wasn't for sale and he'd made it himself. I think me wanting to buy it really lit him up \ud83d\ude01",

But if not, get started with simple projects. Get some shelves, either on the walls or as described above, or open type bookcase(s).  The things that stick on likely aren't strong enough to hold up shelves, although can work fine with pictures.  Shelves will need to be attached with special bolts or screws to the studs. (Holes can be repaired when you move, either you or handyman or some painters can do too.)\n\nStart organizing and filling the shelves. Remember, when arranging furniture or books, or odds and ends, start with big things first, them fill in with smaller ones. \n\nRemove things in the way of you working and reorganize and group with similar things, etc. until you are happy with the results. Doesn't have to be neat and orderly if you aren't comfortable with it. Can also donate, give away, repurpose, and throw away things no longer needed/wanted! It's your room and only needs to work for you!  \n\nBest of wishes with you endeavor. I have the same problem as you and the issue with me is procrastination.  It could be holding you back too, but you are well on your way! Don't give up and it will look so nice and be so nice for you!\n\nSorry for writing a novel. Apparently I like to ramble on and on! It's just that the topic is in the forefront with me as I'm facing the same challenge! And like to hear myself talk?  Quite possibly!

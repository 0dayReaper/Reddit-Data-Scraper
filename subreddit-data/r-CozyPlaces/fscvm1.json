As is, it looks a little awkward.\n\nTo OP: I LOVE your plants and your calming colors. It\u2019s great. Love love love. I also like your furniture. I have a suggestion though. Your shelves with the books and other nifty things are too cluttered looking to look appealing. Because they are drawing the eye upward (which is good, it\u2019s a good idea) the shelf needs to look good. And the table would look more inviting if it wasn\u2019t so far in the corner.\n\n1. Organize the books neatly by color or size, you can even wrap them in colored paper if you want, or maybe even stack them in very near piles with large on the bottom, sometimes this works, sometimes no.\n\n2. Crowded Shelf:  The rocket model (LEGO?) and robot and record album are really cool, they add interest and maybe conversational for you. They may express your interests. But, they need space. If you organize your books, maybe move a few elsewhere, these items could have space to shine.\n\n3. The table and chairs look smashed to the corner. Do you move it out for eating with guests? I looks too tight for 4 chairs to be used.\n\n\n I always appreciate constructive feedback on my projects. It\u2019s hard to see it when you\u2019re in it. :)",

But it\u2019s beautiful though.\n\nOn the other note seeing all these amazing apartments and cozy places as you yourself don\u2019t feel like moving somewhere which is less expensive then NYC, even uptown NY you can get those amazing cozy places at reasonable price then NYC. So my question is, is it really worth it to be in the center of NYC and pay so much to get so less?",

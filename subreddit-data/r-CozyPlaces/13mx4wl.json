The old couch doesn't look comfortable for anyone above a size of 170cm to sit in, you wouldn't be able to relax in such a small couch anyway and it looks like the couch is so old that it might be infested by something, the place is right at an intersection of a road which seems to have at least double lanes and the small carpet barely covers the fact that the floor is cold cement. \n\nI won't even touch the red light, or the cacti, or the very high ceiling, or the wall with high power connection which shows that this is, in fact, not a living area but a business of some kind",

Everything is very pleasing to the eye, and I love the look, but it doesn\u2019t actually look comfortable to lounge in for a long period. I actually love the couch\u2026it\u2019s so gorgeous\u2026but better suited for having a conversation and a cup of coffee with a friend for about 20-30 min. than for relaxing with a book. Even if the couch seemed more comfy, who could possibly truly relax with that huge open window and busy street scene hovering right next to you??",

It was a lovely tour, but the bus driver on Mull had the dullest, most drab voice I had ever heard in my life. Like something out if Monty Python.\n\nThe weather that day was your typical Scottish drizzle. The bus was passing this meadow with a few cattle and the far side of the meadow curved up into the clouds, to which the driver, in his dreary, monotone voice said\n\n\"And here is where you would have seen... the tallest mountain on Mull.\"\n\nAnyway, that's my Mull story. I really wanted to stop on that trip and visit the island more. The whole island is a cozy place.",

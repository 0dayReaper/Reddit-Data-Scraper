Honestly feels like grey has no room in a home, especially not the darker tones. Ironicaly looks really dated, even if it's technicqlly a quite neutral color. Thinkimg about changing floors in the future? More wooden floor would look fantastic with your newly colored walls.\n\nAlso love that you've kept the teak kitchen cabinets. Have they started to get darker from moisture in some places? Can always recommend stroking on some teak oil evey now and then.",

Dining rooms should never have daylight bulbs in them. Large open kitchens like the house I'm in now with 6 can lights above it (12 total for the whole long room) should definitely have daylight bulbs. Every lamp and ceiling fan in bedrooms and living room has yellowish bulbs.\n\nTo not be afraid to mix means you've got an excess of light switches - that's all.",

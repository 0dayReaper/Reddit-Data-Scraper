It got pretty long and the notice said they would mow it and fine me if I don't in 24 hours.\n\nThen we had a record hot summer with wildfire and ash literally raining down in July-September. Everyone's lawn was dead. I got another notice that I was not watering it enough. Can't win lol",

It wasn't in a city but it was still a fairly urbanized area considering it had row homes.

I built a nice little veggie garden in my yard but couldn't maintain it properly because I was getting bitten so many times.  I started planning weeding/gardening time around the wind but I still had to go out and water every day.\n\n\nI semi-understand some of reddit's hate for lawns, especially in desert areas, but I having lived with the reality of someone who let things go completely wild there needs to be a happy medium of native plants that attract bees and encourage wildlife but that still maintain a usable space.",

We just let most of our garden grow wild and just pull some weeds here and there as it goes out of hand. 3 raised beds and some pots to grow veggies. Mostly watered from a barrel that collects rain water from the roof. The rest gets only enough water not to die during hot summer periods. Wild flowers everywhere. Many \u201eweeds\u201c have flowers too. Bees love it. So does our dog. :)\n\nWe don\u2019t live in the desert of course. But from the looks of it neither does OP, so it might be that the fake grass is mostly for aesthetics. it\u2019s not my taste. It\u2019s pretty in a way. But too clean like a movie set or something.",

If you have something that throws out seeds or berries though like a chokecherry then vacuuming is easiest. They also have backfill for animal waste so it doesn't stink. The underlayment is compacted layers of gravel and sand to prevent pooling. But bacteria can still live there. So something like zeofill kills it, or you can buy artificial grass wash from home depot. Brushing it can also make it look nice with a broom. But having need double paned windows that get sun can melt and warp it. A reputable installer will film tint any facing windows first in high heat areas.",

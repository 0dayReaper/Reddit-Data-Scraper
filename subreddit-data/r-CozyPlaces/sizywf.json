Just went to S\u00e3o Paulo and you can get hotels with gorgeous city views for anywhere from like $25-$100. Also went to an insanely gorgeous fancy restaurant called Terra\u00e7o It\u00e1lia, my girlfriend and I both got big plates (more than we could finish) and shared a desert and only spent ~$100.\n\n[Here's the view](https://imgur.com/a/chdjcbR)\n\n[Outside + Inside](https://imgur.com/a/UI5MHu7)\n\nThe only downside of Brazil for me was that you have to pay for every drink &amp; refill (including water) and they put toilet paper in the trash instead of flushing, so that took a bit to get used to. Other than that, it was beautiful, energetic, fun, and an all around unforgettable trip.\n\nSide note: Brazil is a hotspot for medical tourism, so if you need lasik or plastic surgery or a hair follicle transplant or anything, it's gonna be way cheaper there. Most things are cheaper in general, but electronics (phones, laptops, hard drives, etc) are considerably more expensive.",

But theres a good chance we could be hearing about a new variant i\u2019d guess within the next month or two, especially with how widespread current infections are. Thing is, none of us know because you can\u2019t really predict mutations.",

The flu or common cold strains would be considered endemic.  Diseases typically need to mutate or achieve a level of relative non-lethality, due to our own effective immune response, to be endemic.  Thats not technically a requirement, but thats how it plays out in reality.",

I have knees that are sometimes painful, though, so I don't think (long) hikes are possible for me. But I'm assuming safaris happen in cars, right? So that should be possible, even if my knees decide to be difficult. And Sunbird Ku Chawe looks like the perfect place to just sit and enjoy the sheer beauty of that view...",

Some national parks also offer accommodation in the middle of the national park for a more fun safari experience. You can still enjoy all those places without having to hike, I suggested the hikes because that's what most tourists like to do.",

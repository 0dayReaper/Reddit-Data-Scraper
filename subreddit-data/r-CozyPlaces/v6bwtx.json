So the bus has air brakes and I had to get certified for that and everything. The first time I had to drive the bus a long distance was last summer. I was pretty nervous to drive it in general, and when the time came, All of western canada was on fire. The main highways were closed, so I had to take the steepest, cliff-y-est, narrowest, windy-est road ever. My bus is heavy, and you cant ride the brake on steep hills in something like this. So i had to get REAL good at using the engine brake REAL fast. Those 6 hours on that road were probably the most awake and terrified I\u2019ve ever been, haha.\n\nBut now all other driving is easy!",

I didn't have a fancy van, but I don't think it would have made much a difference. Being on the road made me appreciate where I came from even more. It gave me an intense urge to settle down and have a place to truely call home and put down some real roots. It shocked me because I always thought that van life was so cool! Cozy for me is at home with my family sitting by the fire, not on the road. Maybe I'm crazy.",

I\u2019ve seen this several times and always from the US.\nYou rarely see extensive use of groundcover plants in places like the UK, where they favour the cottage garden style with a wide variety. Unfortunately a wide variety results in much more elaborate maintenance. So do you find the maintenance easy or do you use a landscaper?",

The house was a dark brown when we bought it 32 years ago and so were several others on the street, so we took a deep breath and went to peppercorn black, a deep red door and cream trim to soften the look.

I\u2019ll bring wine!  \n\nSeriously tho reminds me of my last house- the previous owners \u201crehabbed\u201d and I wish they would have just left it vintage or gutted it. Like they really cheaply did a few things. Anywho- vintage charm is awesome! We made do for 17 years then really did a renovation. It\u2019s worth waiting to do it right imo. I love your drop leaf table set up- it\u2019s perfect! Happy cooking!",

When we were house shopping I wouldn't even go see something that was \"newly renovated\", because I knew I wouldn't have the heart to rip out something new and feel so wasteful, and also that I strongly dislike the \"flipped\" style. Shiny white kitchens make me very uncomfortable, and I would get so depressed living in a house that looks like a black and white photo. So glad that the all grey trend is finally on its way out!",

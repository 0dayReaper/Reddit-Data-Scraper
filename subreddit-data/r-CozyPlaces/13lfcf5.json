They can dirty up\nA pond with there waist but since it\u2019s so early in the season when they come bcz it\u2019s every year now. I enjoy them. They never come in summer that I wouldn\u2019t want bcz then I have the big power wash done &amp; I would be bummed.  As it is tho they add to my enjoyment of the pond.

Sometimes we don't realize it until tackling a project like this. Especially after it has settled and matured.\n\nMy neighbor has a pond and the biggest cause of her losing her koi are different varieties of birds. Some that live here year round and others migrating through.  And occasional raccoons. She also covers hers with square mesh wire, about 1/2 inch square, cut in big sheets and fastened together with tie wraps.  Covers the pond mostly at night and in daytime during migration seasons. A lot of overhanging plants close to the surface can make it difficult for birds to get to the fish. \n\nI remember one time she was losing fish even though keeping it covered. Then, while cleaning out debris with a large fish net, she scooped out a big snake with a fat belly full of koi!  Big shock!  Not poisonous, but large, unexpected, and definitely fish-eating! It was relocated, a few more fish were added, and life back to normal.\n\nSo, I guess the lesson here is be sure to watch for snakes in the pond!  But again, your pond and landscaping is beautiful. If it were mine I would be outside looking at it and the fish from sun up to sun down. Being a Pisces \ud83d\udc1f, I would be happy as a clam!",

We have raccoons that come &amp; drink &amp; stray cats but the fish are in the center deep they are smart they go in the shallow for me &amp; for bugs or worms but when it\u2019s an animal they are at the 4 foot deep center under the Lillie\u2019s &amp; safe from animals I think most would drown trying to go in 4 feet it might even be 4 &amp; a half feet at the whole center of the pond.  Do you have something similar? If so can they still get them? I know the cats &amp; the raccoon possums skunks we get those they can\u2019t the krane in my last pond I lost my largest he didn\u2019t even eat him just punctured him through with that sharp beak &amp; left. It\u2019s why I bought the decoys. If you see this let me know about your depth. I\u2019d like to know. I\u2019m just curious?",

I knew we have coyotes here (North San Diego County) but got the metal screening and also had a ladder across the top. One night I heard splashing and ran outside to find my Koi fish all gone and the screening ripped apart. It was either a coyote or raccoon, but no trace of it still around.   \n\n\nI have seen rabbits drilled through by either cranes or herons, wasn't sure which.",

For plants or potted plants &amp; then I put in the 3 step water fall in back careful to not use lime stone it\u2019s bad for koi. I went to farms &amp; got rocks for the under water walls to go up the liner. Then gravel on the flat. It has old carpet under the liner I garbage picked to cushion the liner so tree roots don\u2019t puncture. Around the waterfall I put 3 arborvitae ever greens so the water fall looked like it was coming out of the woods. One bush with pretty burgundy leaves &amp; tiny white flowers in spring I forget the name I planted it in the ground on an angle facing then pond so as it grew it would ( weep ) over the pond. I put a big old log under that ( weep ) too on the ground. I put lilac bushes on the side by the house so when I open my windows in spring I smell the lilac it is by my bedroom window so the waterfall sound is always in my room. My family room patio door looks out to this view. In front of it is my paver patio. It was a labor of love &amp; the second pond I built my old house had one too. That I did. I wanted it to look like you were just walking in the woods &amp; this pond showed up. This is a backdrop of my yard then I do have a normal lawn &amp; wood fence like every suburb &amp; lawn but this area brings the whole yard to a new level anytime we have company they live it. It has underwater lights so at night you can see the fan tail koi it\u2019s like a ballet almost is so soothing the sound of the water the grace of the koi.  I will never not have a koi pond. I love to read out here or just sit have a fire out in the pit next to it &amp; enjoy. I\u2019m so pleased you all like it too.",

It\u2019s my absolute favorite hobby since about 18 which was wayyy too many years ago ! I learned so much doing my ponds I really researched them before beginning to dig. What pond owners regretted what worked for them as far as filters &amp; then it was just putting it in to practice &amp; adding the plants bushes around it which I think is just as important it can make it look natural like it was always there or like you dug a whole &amp; added rocks &amp; water. No pond I EVER saw hid the weir the plastic bin that started the waterfall that never made sense to me ? Cover the liner but let that plastic show by just putting hostas around it was what I saw time after time. I knew I wanted evergreens for the waterfall to just come out of the evergreens at the top &amp; that I think is the best backdrop for the ponds in my unprofessional opinion.  Lol I think it\u2019s important to absolutely hide the mechanics.  Thanks again. It\u2019s so nice to have this so well liked. Sometimes I think my woodsy look might look ( sloppy ) when I see formal ponds so you all are making me feel so much better !!!",

It\u2019s really not hard &amp; the maintenance as I was saying is honestly less then a lawn to care for weekly of same size once filters are set up &amp; all good you really only need to power wash like every 4 years or so if that it depends on the look you want   Watch some backyard pond building videos on Utube. I think you\u2019ll see it\u2019s not super hard &amp; it\u2019s fun &amp; the reward is SO worth it in the end it\u2019s amazing. They also have ponless waterfalls that has very little digging just enough to put the box under ground for the water then you cover that with rocks. The kit will show you how to set up the pond less waterfall.  Actually I want a pond less in front of my house. So I have just a large waterfall in my shade garden maybe instead of my bench.  It\u2019s just nice to have a landscape feature that doesn\u2019t look like every other yard everywhere. The pond also the koi as they get large are so much fun. They really interact with you. You pet their heads they beg for treats. The bit of labor at the start is so worth it kind of like child birth once it\u2019s done it\u2019s so wonderful you forget the labor &amp; just enjoy. This is very much the same. Good Luck. I really hope you look into it &amp; do it. There are Pond clubs that once a season often have koi auctions for members to sell fish they don\u2019t want if they are over stocked a fish got larger then they want in their pond or the had fry ( baby fish ). Out by me it\u2019s the Midwest pond &amp; koi society it\u2019s like 25 a year or so to be a member. Then you can go to auctions &amp; they have newsletters where they give &amp; share advice also start of season we have a map &amp; people add their pond to it if they want to participate &amp; it\u2019s a self guided tour of back yard ponds in IL Aquascape also has one you can buy a map for at nurseries that\u2019s how this started for me I saw the maps &amp; bought one &amp; saw a handful of backyard ponds I picked the home owners brain &amp; then began planning my own. I thought they were the most lovely unique things I ever saw in a yard.  So look into pond walks that may be in your area maybe next month. It may just inspire you if you see a few in person. Good Luck to you I hope you take the plunge. Lol",

The previous owner had set it up with a pump that emptied into a pit which was filled with mesh (so had a huge surface area), and which also had a couple of plastic rubbish bins with lillies growing. From there it overflowed into a small pond with more lillies and water irises, and then back into the main pond. \n\nThe previous owner told us it should stay in balance without much more work than keeping it clear of leaves, and he was right. I did clean out the pit and rinsed the mesh at about year three.\n\nSold that house when we moved interstate, and unfortunately koi are not permitted here. We still have a pond with trickling water as a white noise generator to dampen the city noises. \n\nI wish we had the room for a setup like yours. Goldfish just aren't the same :(",

I even have them all named the largest is Roy ( you don\u2019t need to be koi Roy. ) Paul Simon song from my youth. Lol. I have a winter get away now I go to &amp; I just have a fountain in the yard for that water sound I love bcz I\u2019m not here enough to do a pond . Like you tho I need the relaxing sound &amp; it reminds me of home. Where you in a cold water state? I had to put a heater just to keep a whole in the ice so carbon dioxide can escape or the fish suffocate in the ice  they go down to one breath a minute but between that exhale &amp; possible leaves &amp; plant rot algae all let off carbon dioxide as it breaks down I always keep a spare on my shelf too bcz I had it once die in winter &amp; to get one fast it was like 80 extra to get it to me next day before they all died I had about 12 good size at that time.  I lose one here or there over winters one a winter if it thaws freezes thaws freezes back &amp; forth you can lose them all. We lost them all one winter &amp; they were pretty big I actually cried as if my dog or cat died. I know they are fish but large koi have personality.  I use to be able to pet their heads even. It was hard to lose them. Takes a couple years to really restock bcz the first year you know unless you are paying 500 a fish you have to buy them at like 6/7 inches even that by me was 39.99 each fish we would buy 4 at a time then the first year you don\u2019t even see them until they are big &amp; confident they hide. Takes a year or two at least for sure by year 3 they come around &amp; really interact &amp; every year they trust you more &amp; come to tails wagging like a puppy too. My water puppies. I hope some day you can have koi again. Maybe get them &amp; just say who these???  Nooooo their just really big boned gold fish.  Lol whose going to bring in an expert??  Lol",

My biggest ( Roy ) I would say is about 15 inches maybe a bit bigger. The rest are 10 to 12 inches give or take. I love the butterfly I have many a white &amp; 2 yellows &amp; an orange that have the delicate butterfly tails. They are my favorite especially at night with the underwater lights those tails just are gorgeous it adds so much to the koi I think.  I hope u can sneak some into the pond.  It\u2019s not like you would ever dump them into a water way. I can\u2019t imagine anyone doing that. Even when someone closes their pond they put the koi for sale on an app online or on FB marketplace. Who would dump them they are so valuable especially at a large size. I told my daughter that we probably now that they are bigger &amp; not the babies we bought we probably have 2500. To 3 grand in fish in the backyard right now.  Who would dump them even if you got half or a quarter of that selling them ?? Big Koi with any color at all are so valuable",

They only drink from the pond I\u2019ve never seen them try to get the fish. Wow that sucks so much. With your depth tho I would think it has to be the bird. They would drown &amp; the fish I would think like mine instinctively would run from raccoon hands. The heron tho have you tried repositioning the fake heron? I move mine a bit every few months so they don\u2019t appear as fake to some circling heron. I wonder Look into ultrasonic deer repellents. It\u2019s like 49 bucks &amp; you stick it in the ground like a solar light I hear they work. Google them a bunch will come up. I would try something like that maybe there is one for raccoons too. Or maybe a shock wire fence around it like they use to keep dogs in a yard? Maybe it could work for raccoons if lower ??  Just throwing ideas out. I would research how others have gotten these pests away from their ponds there has to be a way to save the fish &amp; plants so you can fully enjoy the beauty of your pond.  I wish you luck with it.  I hope you get it all fixed &amp; have success with it !!",

But after a month or so \u2014 the kois started disappearing. Apparently the local raccoon gang decided they were tasty treats at night. We covered the pond with chicken wire, but they\u2019d find ways to get in. All the koi were gone within a few months. My mom gave up and we filled in the pond. \n\nI hope y\u2019all don\u2019t have a raccoon problem in your neighborhood!! \ud83e\udd9d\ud83d\udc3e",

First sign of an animal they are smart &amp; go to the deep center of the pond &amp; hide under the Lilly pads. This pond I never have lost any to birds or animals at all. \nThere is about 12 or 13 koi in there. They even a couple years ago spawned &amp; I had a bunch of baby koi. You have to have really good water &amp; just the right conditions for them to spawn so I was really happy.  I only kept a couple of the babies &amp; the rest I gave to a couple friends who had also just started up a pond themselves a bit smaller but really cute.  \nThe best defense tho to animals is a larger pond that is pretty deep in the center. I do see raccoons come in the yard &amp; drink from the pond but I\u2019ve never seen them try for the koi the way the koi\u2019s go deep &amp; hide tho. They may not know they are in there. Lol",

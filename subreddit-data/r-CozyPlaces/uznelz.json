Unless you have poured an abundance of money into it. But if that's the case, why not buy something newer if you have that kind of money to begin with. I appreciate any feedback.",

Hence the old saying, bust out another thousand b.o.a.t. with that said, you just can't get this feel in a newer boat. Something about old school that is just, well perfect! Now, cost can be cut by knowing how to work on things yourself. Most sailors I've met are very knowledgeable as most issues don't arise at the dock but while under way or away. As far as reliable, if the bones are intact and the fiberglass or wood is in good shape, maintain it and it will last for you're lifetime and three next.",

In the case of the atlantic, where you are sailing from Europe to North America that means the north atlantic gyre.\n\nThe easy trip is from Europe to North America. You just sail south until roughly the Canary islands, and then go west until you reach America. You also need to time it right. You don't want to be out at sea during the summer because of hurricane season. But if you time it so that you are crossing between November and March, you basically don't have to do anything and this is probably the easiest ocean crossing in the world. You've got consistent and reliable easternlies plus the current of the gyre pushing your ship along.\n\nThe other way is much harder. Your first option is to cut straight through the gyre and go to the Azores. But this means that in the center of the gyre you will likely end up in calm periods of no wind + no current that you just have to wait out. Which is really boring and time consuming. The other option is to hitch a ride on the gulf stream and the northern parts of the gyre. They get you back to Europe quickly but the north atlantic is not a fun place in a small sailing boat. Weather will suck, visibility will be crap and everything will be cold and wet.",

Not like you can do anything about it. The periods that you are close to port or a major shipping lane are way more anxiety inducing. Don't want to end up anywhere near one of those big cargo ships, they are too big to dodge you so if you end up in front of them you're screwed.",

There were a ton of variations that came out of the Ta Shing yard, but just about all of them are built really well.\n\nMine was built in 1979 and is as solid as a tank, although she has had some blistering issues I just fixed, I am constantly surprised at just how tough she is, some really sound structural choices made during production and resin layup.\n\nFunny enough some of the lower hull number have fewer blistering issues that others. Mine was built during the oil embargo so the resin suffered a bit is my guess.",

Now getting the interior to be as nice as OP you are probably looking at double that. Maintenance depends heavily on what state the boat is in and how much you can do yourself. But sailing boats break A LOT. I'd say about 5k in maintenance a year on the low end. 15k on the high end.\n\nBut that's not mentioning the biggest yearly cost: Dock space. It costs money to rent a place in a marina. And depending on where that marina is, the prices per month can easily be equal to renting a nice house. Some people get around this by selling their house, living on the boat and just throwing out anchor along the coast somewhere. But for most people who have things like a job where you need to show up that's not really an option.",

After looking at a lot of similar boats (Tayana, Baba, etc) we decided to prioritize less maintenence over the romantic beautiful brightwork you find in this era of Taiwanese built boats. \n\nWe ended up on a Hallberg-Rassy 352, which is a lot less maintenance. After all the work and money we've put into her it's funny to write that out. But, we love her.",

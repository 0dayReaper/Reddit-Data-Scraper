A giant catfish is in there it\u2019s a catch &amp; release a few people have caught him &amp; put him back it\u2019s mostly blue gills in it I think as far as fish.  There is some odd bird it\u2019s like a black &amp; white duck kind of but it has that same thing turkeys have only it\u2019s on top of it\u2019s beak. It\u2019s that red materials roosters have it too. On this bird tho it\u2019s kind of ugly almost gross. I\u2019m from Illinois so I have no idea the native birds here but that is the oddest.",

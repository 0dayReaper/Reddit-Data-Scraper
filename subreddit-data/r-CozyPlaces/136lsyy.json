The pads and rugs were the exact same size and getting them lined up was an exercise in frustration. They are now making the pads a bit smaller than the rugs themselves, making it so much easier to line it all up.  There's room for error now. \n\nIt's easiest to put the rugs on if you roll the rug first, attach it to two corners and then roll the rest out. The one thing I've been unhappy with lately is the bindings. The quality has diminished in my experience. Not a huge deal, but I've had a few loose threads creating bare spots. IMO, it's worth it to have cute, washable rugs, especially for high traffic areas or pets.",

It looks like it's here to sell furniture, or as a backdrop for some model pics. \n\nI get that it's just a corner of a room, but this just comes across as just a space to look at and perch politely on the edge of the couch. You've got an end table that looks like it has a solid base instead of storage. And the portraits look like they would prevent you from leaning your head back against the wall.",

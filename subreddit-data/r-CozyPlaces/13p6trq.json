Cats also usually don't roam out of sight of home, which has been proven in studies.\n\nCats can be stubborn though and might refuse to come when called occasionally. They know you're calling, they're intentionally ignoring you. I just try again 10 minutes later. They always come back, because it's simply their routine.",

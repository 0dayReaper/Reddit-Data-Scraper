It's disgusting and I do my best to keep it under control. \n\nIt's never gone as far as actual trench foot, but I've spoken to a gp who told me to be extra careful because apparently my feet will just straight murder themselves if they're stuck in wet socks for more than a few hours.",

It\u2019s definitely an issue in this industry but this instance is because of the corona virus nonsense. The small group of us are working together as a team and are willingly not taking breaks so we can work more and cut costs hoping to continue to stay open",

Most of the time, co-workers (if they liked you) would pick up the slack so someone could grab a quick smoke or run to the bathroom. My last job in that industry, which happened to be the offence that caused me to decide to back away from working in the food industry entirely, I was working BOH and was written up for insubordination because I went to the bathroom 7 hours into my 12 hour shift, to handle my monthly lady business. Was told that I should handle that before I clocked in and when I got home. That I had absolutely no reason to leave the kitchen.  The owner himself wrote me up and had the nerve to have his wife in the office while doing so, \"to back him up\". I laughed at him, told her I felt sorry for her, ripped up the write up, walked out, and went right on home to make some phone calls about the disobedience of labor laws. Wasn't too long after that, owner had to shut down, and to add insult to injury, his wife filed for a divorce.",

I either sit in my car, or walk along the nature trail right next to my store. If it's a quiet day, I can bird-watch. Even in the winter, I like to make foot prints in the snow or crunch ice. Way better than sitting in a room and staring at my phone or making awkward small talk with my coworkers (I like my coworkers, but I like my break from people better).",

Most people camped out in their trucks. \n\nWell, I bought a van. A 2015 3/4 ton GMC Savanna with a 6.0 V8. I insulated and paneled the ceilings and walls, put curtains behind the seats, built a wall over the fenders of the rear wheels and installed a 5,000 watt inverter. \n\nI installed a 32\u201d tv, PS4 and cell hotspot on the cabin side of the wall I built, and put a twin bed on a 2x4 and plywood platform I made. I had a Keurig and a microwave and a nice Yeti cooler with dry ice. \n\nOne fateful day in 2018, I was en route to a drill site and got stuck in sugar sand near Kermit Texas.  I had to leave my van and ride with another dude, thinking I\u2019d come get my van out with a big truck and a winch in a day or 2. \n\nWell, when I returned a couple days later, it looked like my van was grey. Wtf? As I got closer, I learned the truth. Someone had torched my van. It was burned to the ground. It got so hot, the aluminum bell housing of the transmission melted into a puddle I still have to this day. The windshield melted. The van and everything in it was a total loss. \n\nI miss that van terribly. My friends gave me shit for driving a rape van, but I didn\u2019t care. I fucking loved it. I wanna build a new one. This time, a high roof, extended wheelbase Sprinter van. Or maybe rebuild and modernize a 1950s school bus. \n\nVan life is the best life. I wanna quit everything and go park somewhere off the Pacific Coastal Highway and post up for a few months. Maybe roll through Yellowstone or the Pacific Northwest. Go hang out in Appalachia country. I just need enough cash for a lifetime of fuel, food and biweekly pit stops in stores in recreationally legal states. I\u2019d never be seen again, unless you happened to be wherever I was posted up.",

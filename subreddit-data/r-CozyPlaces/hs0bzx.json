He notices all these terrifying paintings with scary faces looking at him. He falls asleep, then when he wakes up in the morning, they weren't paintings but windows? That's why this isn't for me.\n\nCreepy edit: it was  not twilight zone, but rather a creepypasta!  https://www.creepypasta.com/the-portraits/",

It was getting dark, and having lost his bearings, he decided to head in one direction until he was clear of the increasingly oppressive foliage. After what seemed like hours, he came across a cabin in a small clearing. Realizing how dark it had grown, he decided to see if he could stay there for the night. He approached, and found the door ajar. Nobody was inside. The hunter flopped down on the single bed, deciding to explain himself to the owner in the morning.\n\nAs he looked around the inside of the cabin, he was surprised to see the walls adorned by several portraits, all painted in incredible detail. Without exception, they appeared to be staring down at him, their features twisted into looks of hatred and malice. Staring back, he grew increasingly uncomfortable. Making a concerted effort to ignore the many hateful faces, he turned to face the wall, and exhausted, he fell into a restless sleep.\n\nThe next morning, the hunter awoke \u2014 he turned, blinking in unexpected sunlight. Looking up, he discovered that the cabin had no portraits, only windows.",

If you go downstairs late at night it feels like you're just in this observation chamber and you can't see anything but anyone outside would see you lit up. It always makes my heart rate go up.\n\nDoesn't help that we get big ass coyotes that will lay right at the edge of the tall prairie grass before it get mowed, staring at us at night. You can see their eyes lit up if you shine a flashlight.",

They're certainly not going to go up to a house where the lights are still on and people are moving around in view. Even if you did have a particularly curious bear, just stay inside. They're not going to break down the door or something like some poorly written Hollywood movie.\n\nCoyotes are just dumber and weaker wolves. They keep a wide berth of human activity. They're also busy out hunting for food so they have no reason to come up and mess with dangerous humans that are locked in a (as far as they're concerned) an impregnable fortress.\n\nMountain lions are also very uncommon here. Less so than bears but still very uncommon. Even then, they're nothing to be worried about when indoors. They're not velociraptors, they can't open doors. They wouldn't anyway. Mountain lions quietly stalk prey that they consider a sure kill and, same as the coyotes, aren't going to bother with people locked in a fortress. Now, out on a trail in the middle of the night, if you hear a mountain lion scream it would be prudent to expedite your walk back home but with a dog or even just a bright flashlight you're well protected.\n\nPeople aren't a concern due to the other user's comments. There just aren't enough people in regions like this. They're too few, too far apart, and the darkness actually plays in your favor here.",

And \"unknown woods at night\" basically has fog of war all over it.\n\nMaybe this is just a more general \"fear of the unknown\" thing?  Not, like, the woods are unknown, but rather \"I'm OK with the concept because I'm pet-sitting right now somewhere the majority of my job is making sure the coyotes don't get the chickens/ducks\".\n\nLots of people just don't have first-hand experience with \"woods at night\" / things bigger than squirrels and raccoons bothering you to have their heads wrapped around them?",

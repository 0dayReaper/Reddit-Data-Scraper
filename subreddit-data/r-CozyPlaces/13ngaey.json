I\u2019ve always had feeders but during the winter it was what got me through some dark days. I love to just watch and see who I\u2019ll get a visit from. I don\u2019t know every species but I\u2019ve had a pleasant variety and it honestly makes me giddy to see some of them so I get feeling proud of it!",

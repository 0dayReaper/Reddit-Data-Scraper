I also really appreciate when people post pictures of their living areas in this sub that actually look like someone is living in them and not these picture-perfect Pinterest-friendly dream rooms. I think the point of a cozy place is to be a little bit messy. Not a lot of course, but you know to look like an actual place where a human resides.",

I remember when I lived in Denver, Colorado, there was a huge push from the Icelandic Air/Tourism board that you could fly there for a ridiculously low amount of money.  Less than $200, I believe.  I didn't realize it had gotten that bad.\n\nHard on the locals but easy money for the government.",

A green roof can help by not reflection so much the light and heat from the sun. It can help with rainwater run off which is another point of pollution in cities. Since the dirt and grass absorb some of the water. Its not creating flooding or heavy puddles as much.",

Almost the entire 500m2 of the house is painted with typical medieval motifs!   \nWe did not expect this and we had not foreseen it in the renovation budget. So we contacted the Architectes des B\u00e2timents de France to have the house classified or registered to protect these paintings. But for the moment we are not successful. We hope to be able to renovate them one day!  \nSome pictures of it : https://imgur.com/a/pOd2Fnq\n\nEdit :\nMy sister created an instagram account that will chronicle the history of the house and their discoveries. If you're interested, it goes here. She'll start telling it all soon!  \nhttps://www.instagram.com/logis_de_la_cendrery/",

So many of their buildings are very old, and they have laws against taking them down.  My first hotel in Paris was also 15th century across from Notre Dame, which is like 12-13th century.  In like London, you will see Some old buildings, but mixed with many new ones, don't see many new ones in interior of Paris.  Favorite bar there is like is a cave/ruins like 1,000 years old.",

The only difference being where the bomb came from. \n \nParis will always remain the exception but every town in the north of France has received a non negligeable amount of shelling both by the Allies and by Nazi Germany. Big costal cities like st Nazaire, Lorient, Brest, Saint Lo, Le Havre, Dunkerque or Calais were wiped from the map (https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardements_en_France_durant_la_Seconde_Guerre_mondiale). \n\nIn \u00cele de France unexploded WW2 ordinances (mostly American) still remain the main cause of infrastructure delay to this day. I've yet to visit a big town in the north of France that didn't get heavily bombed during WW2 (Paris excluded).\n\nEven big towns in the south of France like Marseille and Lyon got their fair share of shelling.\n\nIt's true nonetheless that a lot of French architecture survived WW2, not because France was spared quite the contrary. But because it would have been a waste of ammunition. \n\nCastles and historical landmarks are often far removed from city centers and strategic targets. And contrary to london, which is a big growing blob, towns are quite spread out in France. \n\nAlso, most people underestimate how large France is. It has the 2nd largest territory (metropolitain) in Europe after Ukraine.\n\nIt is saddening that people still seem to think that France paid no price in WW2 and did just fine.\n\nFrench casualties in WW2 are higher than British or American casualties... \n\nTLDR: American and Brits don't like going on about how they liberated their ally by bombing it to the ground",

            "comment": "My Aunt and Uncle ( now passed) had a Cafe in a very small village in Yonne (69). The structure was equipped with walls, more than One Meter thick. When the building was modernized after WW2in the early 60', all the wiring and plumbing had to be drilled through the exterior structure. The stones at the base of the building, were 1 meter thick, all around. The structure was 2 stories, the living quarters were upstairs and there was a barn and storage unit adjacent to the building. The stones were gradually smaller and less heavy as the bulding gained height. My family kept the bullet marks and holes made by the liberating forces when the Americans swept through most of France to chase out the Nazis. The building was totally converted to a residence when my cousin sold off the property in the early 2000's. The experior was remodelled. I do not know if the war momentoes that were on the structure were kept.",

I keep my cat out of my room that holds my plants because she wasn\u2019t trained as a baby to avoid plants (she\u2019s 13 so we just treat her like the princess she is). Your cats may not be like that tho and might just leave them aline! If they get curious, you can still try to train them to leave them alone. but make sure you get one that\u2019s non-toxic for cats to air on the side of caution. You can use tinfoil or duct tape sticky side up to deter them. These scare them/freak them out so they learn to avoid the area. If that doesn\u2019t work, I know there\u2019s shields available on Amazon that you could try and purchase :)",

A lot of people have a tendency to hang things too high when hanging pictures on the wall. Also, I think the lamp in the corner, next to the red chair should be pulled out into the corner more. It\u2019s really sweet the way it is, I\u2019m just suggesting. \ud83d\udc4d",

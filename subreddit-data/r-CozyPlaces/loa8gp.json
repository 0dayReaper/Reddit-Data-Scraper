Planning on heading west in the spring.\n\nThe kitchen has a good sized, deep sink, an induction cooktop with two burners, a fridge/freezer and a microwave. There are a couple more pics on my instagram.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty comfortable to move around for one person and I have some ideas to add more fold-out counter space. Some people build incredible house-sized kitchens in their rigs though.\n\nThere are definitely sacrifices to living tiny but the beauty is that you can build exactly what you want a dedicate space based on your priorities. If you have more questions shoot me a DM!",

It's a blessing for our tiny apartment kitchen with limited counter space - and an old, inefficient oven that heats up the apartment pretty quick!",

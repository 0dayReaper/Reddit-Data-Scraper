I was expecting this to get only like 5 comments. I'll  try to reply after I'm done with work. I'm gonna answer a couple of questions here:  \n\n1. The apartment is about 400 sqft. No bedroom. That's why I said tiny, which I understand is relative. That sectional turns into a decent comfy bed. I tried to make the best of the limited space I had.\n\n2. The rent is much cheaper than you think. The guesses here are crazy, I'm not millionaire, trust me! lol\n\nEdit2:\nThe price for this apartment should be around $500k, it would have been closer to $400k a few years ago. I'm currently renting it. The rent for this size goes between $1450 to $1900, and depends on the floor level and what the owner wants. I think the reason people think it's so luxurious is because of the view, or maybe the way I furnished/decorated it, which I'm gonna take as a complement. \ud83d\ude0a",

The only difference is when you cross borders, or buy imported products that are nominally priced in USD.\n\nThe Canadian dollar was on par (+/- 5%) with the USD until oil tanked in 2014 and the Canadian economy with it, and so a lot of the COL prices and salaries haven't adjusted to a functionally lower-valued currency.",

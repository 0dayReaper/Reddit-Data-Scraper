It's from Portugal, it says.\n\nCorrection: the throw on the chair is from Amazon. The one on the couch is from Home Goods. \n\n[Peacock Chair Throw](https://a.co/d/4u8g1yi)\n\nIn my original post someone liked my curtains, so [here](https://a.co/d/guQ9B7P) they are as well for anyone lookin!",

It's a numbered chair (400 total) that I got from Home Goods \"Made in India\" section on clearance for $400. If you're looking for a similar feel, I was debating on several I saw on the Anthropologie website. I think they're too pricy for me, but great inspo there.",

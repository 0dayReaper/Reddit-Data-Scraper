I have Asperger's (or ASD as it's referred to now) and one of my most pronounced issues is with noise. There is almost nothing as peaceful to me as a quiet walk down dark streets during a good snowstorm. \n\nI grew up in Redmond, WA near Seattle, snow here is fairly uncommon. We often go several winters without any snow accumulation so when I was a child it was a fun, special experience. Whenever the forecast would call for snow I would wake up a half dozen times during the night to look outside and see if the snow had begun falling. Directly across the street from our house was a cul de sac and at the bottom of that cul de sac was a street light. I always used the light from that to see of it had started snowing yet.\n\nAnywho, your comment reminded me of those good old days.",

Next we can mover on to all of the snow that needs to be shoveled (by hand because \"we don't need a snow blower that's why we had boys.\") from walkways, drive ways, etc.  Than we can move on to slogging through the slush and muck once all the pretty snow has stopped and temp has warmed back up a few degrees to start melting everything. You have to slog through all that slush and muck because you don't get to stay inside and enjoy the cozy fire when there are animals and chores to tend too.  \n\nSorry for being the downer on this thread, just a brief flash back to my youth, please enjoy the cozy cabin with it's fire and wonderful view.",

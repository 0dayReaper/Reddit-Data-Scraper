For our time in Mexico City, I worked out of a WeWork office in Zona Rosa, which was really cool - it was on the 32nd floor, so you could see all the way to the mountains on the edge of the city (on a clear day, which wasn't too often).\n\nOther than that, though, working was not as easy. If you're living in one place, you'll be fine, but even if a hotel offers internet, the WiFi may not reach your room (I had to spend the day in a hotel lobby once). Mexico is also _loud_. Mexico City is like any big city, really, but a lot of the smaller ones are more active than you expect. Guanajuato has roving Mariachi bands that play for tourists until well after midnight. I guess that's to be expected in the touristy places, though.\n\nYou're also going to get sick, even if you're careful about not drinking the water. Every pharmacy sells what is essentially Pedialyte (the brand name there is Electrolit), usually right out of the front window. I've seen plenty of locals drinking it in public, there's no shame there, it just happens.\n\nI really enjoyed my time in Mexico, though. Definitely go and visit, but you should try it out and see if it works for you before making a commitment.",

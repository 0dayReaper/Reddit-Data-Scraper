The niche market we carved out wasn't large enough (or with deep enough pockets) to justify continuing despite happy customers.\n* Cofounder issues.  We stopped getting along, is the best summary.\n* Built a feature instead of a product.  Probably didn't do as much customer interviewing as I should've.\n* Product was built on top of a third party data source for a significant chunk of our data.  That source went away, was not replaceable, and resulted in a hole in the product large enough to churn out most of our customers with no prospects to regain.\n* Product required some amount of buy-in from a regulatory entity (to keep it vague).  That entity initially  wanted to work with us to help facilitate the solution we were offering their constituency.  A regime change happened and that stance reversed in the full opposite direction - open hostility and a desire to block forward progress.\n\nI've advised and consulted for a few more, here are some offhand very anonymous summaries:\n\n* Company was unable to achieve product/market fit despite quite a few pivots.  The market was very difficult, one of those \"you don't know you need this thing until its simply too late\" kind of thing, so it was hard to sell.  \n* Company focused far too much on technical excellence to the point where they were shipping product way, way too slow.  They ran out of money and couldn't raise again, likely due to lack of progress for the $ spent.",

            "comment": "I've failed a few times in the past, thankfully never with severe consequences. In hindsight that's a huge upside to doing it the Lean / Customer Discovery way, because if you're going to fail, you at least fail before things get too serious with employees, funding, and so on.\n\nMy most notable (for me, at least!) failures would be:\n\n1. I failed on a wine-tech thing because I really did not understand the market. The tech was solid, and I'm pretty convinced it could be made to work profitably, but I had _no_ idea what I was doing with regard to value chains, where our product actually came in, who benefited from it, and so on. My team ended up giving me a wake-up call before things got too serious, which, in hindsight, was 100% the right thing to do, and we pulled the plug on it.\n\n2. My second notable failure was more personal; I developed a solar heating solution and built a prototype that worked better than expected. However, I did this as part of my Master's Thesis, and when I tried to settle the IP details (namely, who owned it and who could bring it to market), my University's services threw up all manner of barriers. With hindsight, I should have been able to navigate them, but, at the time, I was really low on motivation, and I had an attractive job offer waiting for me, so... I took the job. The tech I developed never made it to market. I hope the Uni people cherish that bit of IP they kept back for no good reason.\n\nI've had other, minor failures, but those two were the better learning moments for me.\n\nThe key learnings I derived from them can be summarised as:\n\n* having a team you trust is hugely important, not just for the day-to-day work, but also for the big decision moments\n* you need to really understand your market, on a fundamental level, not just market sizing and key stakeholders, but you really need to go deep into the hows and whys of who is creating value, where, how, what their problems are, etc, not just who is paying for stuff\n* do not underestimate your motivation levels. You need to keep your spirits up, because there will be hard times, and you need to be in a good head space to deal with them.",

Did everything from supply chain and vendor management to accounting and finance to performance management and recruiting. \n\nWe weren\u2019t really growing at venture scale and couldn\u2019t really sell our core product. Our CEO had gone through a head of marketing and head of sales and was out of ideas for growth. \n\nEnter me being put in charge of all revenue growth. We had some solid sales people and customer success people who were hard working but didn\u2019t really have any internal pull to turn the ship toward where they wanted to head. \n\nI didn\u2019t really do anything fancy. I just sort of gave them permission to do things they felt were working. We trimmed down the product offering, sold bigger deals, paid less attention to bad customers, watched our growth metrics, and had good weekly and monthly check-in cadences. \n\nThings went really well. We ended up 20x-ing revenue and getting a valuation &gt;$600M (height of ZIRP. I\u2019d guess we should\u2019ve had a valuation at $300M max). \n\nA little before the round closed I was told by our CEO that they\u2019d be bringing in professional management. I also received instructions to \u201cnot change anything major in the department\u201d but still was given a goal to 3x revenue.\n\n(Personal note: At this time I panic bought my shares. Paid basically a down payment on a house. Wasn\u2019t the worst because we were able to sell some shares secondary and I grossed basically a house. Less taxes and cost to exercise, I netted 1-2 years of salary)\n\nNo surprise, but I didn\u2019t hit targets. I just didn\u2019t have the operations ready for that scale and I didn\u2019t have the internal pull to make major upgrades to my departments. I couldn\u2019t get pricing concessions out of our CFO to close some bigger deals that could\u2019ve sustained our growth. Our product wasn\u2019t getting innovated on in the right ways (eng resources focused on the wrong features). \n\nAfter the professional management team came onboard I was let go. My general thought is I\u2019m seen as sort of a scape goat for growth slowing. I don\u2019t really mind though as long as they someday sell the company for near the last round\u2019s valuation. \n\nGeneral lessons: \n\nI probably should\u2019ve left earlier. This was hard because on paper I was essentially receiving $80k/month in options and was getting paid in cash pretty well. However being in a position where I wasn\u2019t really wanted burned me out and I haven\u2019t fully recovered (even 12 months later). I\u2019ve been in therapy pretty much every week and go through good and bad cycles. \n\nIf I didn\u2019t leave earlier, I should\u2019ve asked for more control over the strategic direction of the company. I think if I had more product pull and financial pull we could\u2019ve threaded the needle and hit our growth targets.\n\nI\u2019m in a weird spot professionally. Companies see me as too senior and too much of a generalist to put into an IC role, but too junior to be put in charge of the entire enterprise. I\u2019m not really a marketer, salesperson, or customer success person so I don\u2019t get looks for those Director or VP titles. \n\nBut I can hire all those ICs and a layer of management, establish the processes, get the teams working together, and get all the funnel metrics fleshed out.\n\nBasically I\u2019m torn between stepping back 1-2 levels in my career to hone a craft/vocation or trying to push ahead to find someone who needs to grow from $1M ARR to $20M or $30M.",

One owner was mortgaging his entire life to keep the business afloat while the other owner was busy leveraging his \"founder\" status into deeper and deeper wells of personal debt.  Neither had an exit strategy, one ended up declaring bankruptcy.\n2. We had a decent core product, a fairly expansive (if intensely local) user base, but never leveraged what we had into something less niche.  As time went on, market conditions changed, the business failed to adapt, and sales fell to zero.\n3. In the early days, there were 3 of us brought in as employees and 3 owners.  Two of us at the employee level saw the writing on the wall in terms of the market and attempted to throw out some ideas for where we could take the initial solution in order to break out of the niche and access new clients.  Because we weren't \"owners\" we were roundly ignored.\n\nSo, my lessons learned from this experience were: don't start a business without an exit strategy.  Don't take on partners.  If you do take on partners, don't let one partner run themself into the ground while the other one fucks off.  If you hire smart/talented people early on, maybe pay attention to them - even if they're saying something you don't want to hear.\n\nMy own two failures had to do with me buying into a narrative that didn't really fit the service I was providing.  On the third try, I ignored the standard advice, did things my own way, and so far it has been fairly successful.  It'll never be a million dollar business, but it's self-sustaining and brings me enough income to be comfortable.",

If only I understood that with growth we could have negotiated the % down. But I was 15 and my friend 16 which meant we obviously lacked experience.\n* A friend and I made FB post moderation using their API since in the UI it was impossible to do anything. Flopped because we lost passion and got frustrated with the API. Can't remember the exact year but it was a bit later than 2007.\n* Ran a fast food business - flopped because my delivery logistics were bad and I didn't want to pay a delivery company to handle it for me. Again, hindsight, should have bitten the bullet and scaled it first and then took over logistics. \n* Ran a peer-to-peer teaching/learning programming community and a peer-to-peer mental health community. The former failed because I was the only moderator and teacher, but was learning the ropes myself, the latter failed because I had to de-prioritize it despite being passionate about it.\n\nHad tons of learnings from this one and just wrote about some of them on my substack - mainly about how I validated the fast food business idea and how testing and validating before committing to a business idea can increase the chances of success.",

I never failed outright, every failure was a sort of fail forward thing because I was naturally good at sales. I always failed to live up to my own expectations because I did not actually know what I was doing because I didn't have enough experience. It's been 15 years of that and I pretty much know what I am doing these days so I am living up to my own expectations these days. \n\nJust keep failing (forward) until you succeed.",

    "postText": "I've been seeing a lot of stuff come up about non developers wanting to start a tech company. The truth is we get blasted with ideas all of the time. I personally get people frequently coming to me with the latest and greatest idea that is going to make us all billionaires. I've been out at some social event and after telling people that I am a developer, after being asked what I do of course, sometimes they'll be racing to get me to sign a NDA to tell me their next great idea. So let's take up a few things here:\n\n1. Your idea isn't nothing unless you have a) adequate enough skills to have purpose beyond having the idea itself, or b) have enough resources.\n\n2. If you have no proper way of communicating that idea you're screwed from the start. Give us some form of document that lays out the business with basic market research, a marketing plan, and rough financials. I'm not saying projections or in depth stuff here. More of a pitch deck with maybe a little more detail.\n\n2 b. Have some knowledge in programming. You don't need to be a programmer, but you do need to understand differences between front end and back end development and it would be good to know what frameworks are being used. Honestly, a few weeks time on codecademy and lynda.com will serve a lot in being able to communicate with your developer. \n\n3. (This doesn't apply to investors) Know your worth. You don't deserve a controlling stake because you had the idea. If you have a good idea, but are only capable of doing 20% of the work to get that company up and running you get 20% of the company. Now, this also excludes people that might have a big enough rolodex to bring a lot of clients, which for ease sake I'll consider investment into the company. \n\nYou wouldn't believe how many times where I've heard a person's idea out and the scenario turns into you'll do 95% of the work and I'll own 95% of the business.\n\n4. Don't be rude. I was at a social event a few months back and a women with a business gave me her card and told me she wanted to have an app made. I asked her a few questions, waited for her reply, and while I was trying to think about how I could help or if it was the right job for me she took her card right out of my hand and got offended. My guess was because I wasn't extremely enthusiastic about her idea.\n\n#What You Can Do If You're Starting\n\n1. Learn to code. It's essential for three reasons. a) You'll be able to have a better understanding if your idea is viable. b) At least to know what you need, what you're talking about and how to technically communicate your ideas. c) It will stop you from getting ripped off. I had a guy the other day calling me an idiot because I wouldn't sell $50 wordpress templates to clients for $7k a pop. Developers can be as shady as any other profession and it's not uncommon for people to get ripped off.\n\n2. Start making yourself essential to the company you're starting. This can only be done if you've gained experience in a certain skill set, so start by getting experience. \n\n3. Do the damn thing. You won't know if this will work until you try. When you're doing it you'll be able to make adjustments as you learn more and if it's going to be a failure you'll probably spot other opportunities now that you have newer skills. \n\n4. At a minimum know how to create a pitch deck, but it's also a good experience to learn how to build business plans. Not because you'll need a business plan for whatever you're doing (You might), but because it gives you the ability to analyze and configure ideas quicker.\n\n**Edit**\n\nIf you're not a technical person I think u/Chief_Executive_Anon highlights the ideal person a developer would want to work with. [You can read their comment here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/897was/developer_here_i_dont_care_about_your_ideas_i/dwr8lqd/)\n\nWhen asked what value as a non technical person they added to the company they said this:\n\n&gt;Good question. I brought an idea that had been distilled into a comprehensive business plan, with a realistic roadmap to get us from A-Z (though that roadmap is fluid and ever changing given the complex variables that manifest day in and day out).\n\n\n&gt;On top of that, I brought an ability to communicate that allowed me to be the primary interface between this company and the outside world in the early days. Thus, I handled fundraising (if you\u2019ve never done it, think of your best idea and go ask somebody to give you $25,000 to make it a reality... it\u2019s a hard skill to conquer!), I handled PR. And I handled marketing to prospective customers when we had an MVP (minimum viable product) in order to evidence the viability of our product and monetization model.\n\n\n&gt;I also brought a shit ton of passion and found that I cared enough to hustle harder than I ever thought possible. Hope this helps. Happy to answer any other questions you may have.\n\nThis is exactly what we need. They put together a business plan and lined out how they would make the business viable. Then they came ready to handle all marketing, funding and PR. This is the ideal candidate to work with. It shows they care about their idea. \n\nBusiness plans are not easy to put together since they challenge you to think every aspect of a company out. I'm not saying you have to do a business plan, but someone **needs** to be able to provide the map to becoming successful.",

I learned how to program.\n\nNow I am not saying everyone should learn to program like the OP said. But ideas are cheap. So these folks definitely need to bring some more to the table. Learning how to setup a wordpress site to maybe do some basic validation might be a good place to start. Understanding Google Analytics and GTM would go a long way with that too. And neither of those require actual programming skills. At most a modest/reasonable amount of time and perhaps some money for a cheap course and WP theme.\n\nAnd I'm definitely far beyond the, go code my idea for 3 months and I'll give you a cut of the business. You're asking us to assume a MASSIVE risk here and none on your part. So we should assume all the opportunity cost? Your idea probably won't work. Don't feel bad, most of mine won't either.",

Thus, I handled fundraising (if you\u2019ve never done it, think of your best idea and go ask somebody to give you $25,000 to make it a reality... it\u2019s a hard skill to conquer!), I handled PR. And I handled marketing to prospective customers when we had an MVP (minimum viable product) in order to evidence the viability of our product and monetization model. \n\nI also brought a shit ton of passion and found that I cared enough to hustle harder than I ever thought possible. Hope this helps. Happy to answer any other questions you may have. ",

Sometimes the solution is simple and unrelated to the software itself. The challenge, I believe, is communicating this to the tech team.",

(Scammers still put a fair bit in though unless they can generate hype on their own but that's the same as pyramid and mlm schemes) The scammeist ICOs just build hype and don't even bother with having any kind of blockchain, they just claim to but they going to have to generate a lot of hype.",

Entrepreneurs need to understand how to communicate well technically, but I suggest pseudocode. \n\nTheir time is much better spent on technical project management, which does require effective communication. Frankly, I think this learn to code mantra *results in every other problem you talk about. And at least one you don't.*\n\nThere's a pernicious idea on the other side, nothing is important but code. That drives projects into code before they ever know about market viability or user requirements. And that's passed off as a fault of business management. It is just as much a fixation, a sort of code first ask questions later attitude. Everybody is going to save time by starting on the back end right away. Makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. \n\nPseudocode is that one step back that might let in some sense of a user. It's right around here the programmers are ripping their card out of your hand. Offended that focus could ever be off the user. Just odd the address on these cards always lists Edge Case City as where they work. \n\nEntrepreneurs that are nothing more than idea guys are a huge problem. The other being tech as the tail that ate the dog it used to wag behind. For people whose craft has been self-described as raw imagination, I get phenomenal amounts of \"Impossible.\" \n\nHere's the message sequence. \"We have a problem\"; \"We think it may be a show stopper\"; \"we're kicking it over now\"; \"Nevermind we figured it out.\"\n\nCommunications problem indeed. Ignoring this crap is half the game. \n\nJust about all the stuff that is going to form a foundation for even laughable competitive advantage is on the other side of impossible. One heck of a lot of the good stuff that takes an app from \"meh\" to \"great\" is on the other side of a show stopping problem. A remedial junior level programmer that will buy into every lame excuse is not what the project needs at its head. Whatever an entrepreneur needs the goal is to push what is feasible up to the level the market demands for viability. That's why nobody wants that known before launch. \n\nBut it's a nice fantasy. It ignores the tremendous failures where business and tech skip hand-in-hand right off a cliff. ",

I say adobe xd because anyone can be taught that in about 4 hours. \n\nI'll also agree that too much focus is placed on the programmer to creating a successful startup in a sense. I've also written on here about how to do market research, something that all programmers who want to have a startup should know to do before they start a project. \n\nWhat I've said is a problem in the confines of entrepreneurs being just idea guys and not really much else of substance. But it absolutely needs to be said that there are A LOT of programmers spending months on projects that will flop just because they think it's a good idea. You see that regularly on this sub as well: Programmers finishing a project and then starting a thread on how to market it. ",

It's easy to come up with ideas, much, much harder to implement them on a technical level.\n\nOne point I'll throw out that I haven't seen mentioned is idea validation. I think this gets glossed over very easily. Validating if people need or want your service or product AND are willing to pay for it in some fashion is really important and overlooked all the time. You can have the best new SaaS service that fixes a real problem for users, but if it costs you $20/mo to fix that problem and people are only willing to pay $10/mo you have a problem. ",

If you want to do something with yours, put in the effort to become technically savvy enough to generate more than just an idea if you are serious about starting a tech company\n\nHere's what I don't like...\n\nThe whole post seems to come from an adversarial \"you need me way more than I need you\" place.  I don't know you OP, nor do I mean any offense, but you come across to me as someone who writes code for a company, not someone who runs their own business.\n\nIf you have zero interest in starting a new company, that's one thing and easy to communicate politely.  \"I spend waaaay more time in front of a computer than I want to right now, sorry I just can't take on any more work.\"\n\nBut if it's something you are actually entertaining, you might be well-served to listen more closely to some of those myriad ideas you're getting hit up with.\n\nTo be successful, a startup needs a good idea (great is even better), a great team and enough cash to keep them engaged, good timing, and a fair bit of luck.  It's 500:1 the ways it can all go right vs the ways it can all go wrong.\n\nSo, next time some pleeb  idea person hits you up, maybe listen more closely.  Engage the conversation not from a \"I ain't got time for this\" point of view but from one where you really are looking for a great idea to engage in.  If you really have the skills but not an idea, AND you want to do your own thing, the time it takes to listen might be the best you ever spent.\n\nEDIT: Tweaked my TL/DR",

I don't know you OP, nor do I mean any offense, but you come across to me as someone who writes code for a company, not someone who runs their own business.\n\nI'm doing it on my own right now and going through funding processes. I actually came from marketing and had a business before I started coding. I also had an idea stolen from me as well, so that's why I started coding my own ideas out. So not only am I programmer, I was once the pleb with ideas. \n\nI want to take up on this specifically:\n\n&gt;\"you need me way more than I need you\"\n\nIn most of the cases that I, and I think you'll see from other developers commenting this is the case. We'll have some uncle wanting t code them some widget that does something and they'll take 90% of the company for having the idea.\n\nOn the other hand this isn't always the case. If someone with a reputation in their area, say a chef, came up to me and asked me to develop them an app for them and spoke about an equity position, I would base how much I get on factors like how big their rep was. If it was a local chef in a medium sized town then I might do 50/50. If it was someone like Gordon Ramsey, or someone with prestige then I would happily give them more than 80% of the company. I'm over exaggerating and this is a broad example, but the goal is to alert those of their worth.\n\nIf someone comes to me with an app idea I am always willing to listen, but I've also been very blunt with people who just ideas and asked them what do I need you for if all you are is the idea itself. Someone coming to me with a great idea with no drive to do anything beyond that needs to know that's not how it's going to work. \n\nIt should be drilled into the peoples heads that if you are starting a tech company and you're not competent tech wise or don't have resources, you better know your worth and be able to establish what you're bringing to the table. Many cases happen where I'll get explained some new idea and the person explaining it just says they're good with people or have small time connections. ",

You can answer those becuase you execute in sales. You can come with letters of intent, way before coding and the idea pitch. The common \"have money\" refrain from developers is a poorly phrased version but showing the money you made from this startup is way more convincing than any idea ever could have been. ",

This being said I have had an idea stolen, which is why I went from marketing to coder. So although I don't sign NDAs, I'll sometimes force people I am contracting work out to sign them.\n\nI think I get away with this because I am a fullstack developer and have a marketing background. So the people that I am contracting I will know exactly what they'll be doing. At the point where I need investors, I'll be past the point where I need people to be signing NDAs since my product will be out in the world. \n\nI also don't force everyone to sign NDA's. Contractors that are just working on small segments of code for me, or people that I deem as non threatening like lawyers or government grant committees I never force to sign NDAs. This being said the people who learn about the strategies or features that make my company competitive always sign them.\n\nSo it just sort of depends.

Even at that, you can still learn how to design mockups in programs like Adobe XD.\n\nBefore I started in tech I had my own business that involved merchandise and also had a marketing and advertising background. Now that I'm it I see really shady stuff that happens to people when they undervalue developers contributions. \n\nAs I used in an example I've seen people get ripped off. The biggest thing I've been seeing going on is people hustling wordpress themes that cost $50 for $7k. As I said, we're no different than any professional so we have those who do shady work. If you don't know anything about what's going on in your tech company that you've contracted me to build for you what is to stop me from delaying to product, adding features that are not needed, or convincing you you need a native app when really you need a progressive web app? How can you even make solid decisions? We could bleed you dry if you're just going to throw money at us and it happens every single day. Most notably with governments hiring tech firms.\n\nTruthfully, now that I've gone through all of this to become a developer. The things that make an effective business leader are taught in every single tech hub. We don't need people who are just all ideas and for the most part we can get through with what we learn from techhuubs to get us to funding. After that we'll need people that have more strength in business. \n\nYou need to learn code and have a sense of what's going on if your going to get into a company that is making app. Or you need to have a partner that knows it. You can't make effective decisions without it.",

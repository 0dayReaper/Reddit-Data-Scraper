    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nLong story short, I have been working (unpaid) on the side for a pre-seed, not-yet-operational tech startup for a couple of months with a view to quitting my job and becoming co-founder/COO when funding is secured. \n\nHowever, I just received a significant promotion at my current place of work (Consulting). It\u2019s in my best interests to cement this promotion by doing some significant time in the new role before leaving. On that basis I don\u2019t think the time is right to be making the leap of faith into the startup world now. Plus, balancing this work on the side has been chipping away at me and isn\u2019t sustainable.\n\nMy questions for you are as follows:\n- Would this unpaid COO work (product strategy, market sizing, engaging with investors) be considered relevant experience for future opportunities either in startups or in private equity, VC, strategy or similar? \n- Since the business is not yet operational, is the experience redundant?  \n\nI should note that I can\u2019t do both opportunities at once when the company begins to operate - i.e I\u2019d have to drop out of one or the other after funding was secured.",

If you're pre-launch there's nothing for them to consider beyond some anecdotal information about what could have been. \n\nIf you and your buddies plan a trip but never take it .. you didn't travel.",

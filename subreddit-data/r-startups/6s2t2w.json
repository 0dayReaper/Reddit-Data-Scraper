    "postText": "It\u2019s hard to imagine successful companies struggling to acquire customers. We see the successes with their hordes of fans and we think, \u201cWow, they\u2019re so lucky. They have it good.\u201d\n\nYet every single behemoth in existence once had to court its first customer.\n\n[In this post](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/how-to-get-first-customers/), I feature some of their stories. You\u2019ll find in them a generous mix of grunt work, guts, and genius.\n\n**1 &amp; 2: Tinder and Alibaba \u2013 physically traveled to their first users**\n\n*Tinder went from 5,000 to 15,000 users by getting sorority girls to signup on the spot*\n\nCrucial to [Tinder\u2019s success](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/how-tinder-obtained-more-than-50-million-users-through-word-of-mouth/) was then-CMO Whitney Wolfe\u2019s ideas for building an early user-base. She planned a tour that would take her to prominent college campuses around the country.\n\n- She would go to chapters of her sorority, do her presentation, and have all the girls at the meetings install the app.\n- Then she\u2019d go to the corresponding brother fraternity\u2014they\u2019d open the app and see all these cute girls they knew.\n- Tinder had fewer than 5,000 users before Wolfe made her trip. When she returned, there were some 15,000.\u201d\n\n*Alibaba \u201cbrute-forced\u201d its success by visiting factories one by one*\n\nBack in the early \u201900s,  Jack Ma sent out a large sales force to fan out across the country, visiting factories one by one to show them how they could use Alibaba and Taobao to sell stuff online.\n\nBack then, a large number of factories in China weren\u2019t used to working with other people online, and sometimes didn\u2019t even have computers or Internet.\n\nIt was hard work, but companies quickly flocked to Alibaba and its holdings. This allowed them to get an edge over eBay.\n\n**3 &amp; 4: Quora and Reddit \u2013 seeded their sites with their own content**\n\n*Founders solved the chicken-and-egg problem by contributing the bulk of early content themselves*\n\n[Quora](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/quora-marketing-strategy/) and Reddit are two of the largest online forums in existence today, but they were once ghost towns with the chicken-and-egg problem of \u201cempty site = no users / no users = empty site\u201d.\n\nQuora co-founders D\u2019Angelo, Cheever and Cox wrote most of the earliest questions and answers themselves. The first employees and beta testers then continued this trend, until the platform generated enough activity for them to stop.\n\nReddit did the same, but it also created fake profiles. According co-founder Steve Huffman, it took several months before the front page would fill up organically without their submissions.\n\n**5 &amp; 6: Threadless and Dropbox \u2013 the biggest believers in word-of-mouth**\n\n*Dropbox launched shared folders and a massive referral campaign*\n\nThe Dropbox empire was built on referrals.\n\n- With its massive word of mouth campaign, Dropbox grew its user base by 40 times \u2013 from 100,000 to 4,000,000.\n- In April 2010 alone, Dropbox users sent 2.8 million direct referral invites.\n- But on top of that, Dropbox itself was designed to encourage sharing. They introduced shared folders, a nifty feature that encouraged users to invite others to share access to folders.\n\n*Threadless let its community run their own initiatives*\n\nOne of Threadless\u2019 crucial early moves was to start a massive word-of-mouth campaign.\n\nFrom the get-go, [Threadless supported community](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/threadless-marketing-strategy/) initiated \u201crogue contests\u201d(spontaneous, themed tee shirt contests).\n\nIn turn, its community is insanely creative, and also fiercely loyal brand advocates.\n\n**7: Black Milk: Fashion + Fandoms = Great Success!**\n\nThe clothing store achieved its impressive growth by milking fandom for its worth. It didn\u2019t stop at making pop culture-inspired apparel \u2013 it established serious legitimacy by getting official license for all their geeky wear.\n\nIt\u2019s also made its Facebook page a fandom watering hole. Over there, dedicated \u201cSharkies\u201d can connect with like-minded fans.\n\nThere\u2019s even a Black Milk-approved group where girls can swap, buy, and sell their purchases with each other.\n\n**8: OKCupid \u2013 legendary content on OKTrends averaged 4,222 tweets per post**\n\nThe content on OKTrends was so mindblowingly insightful that people actually despaired when it was discontinued. Who wouldn\u2019t want to read and share this post titled \u201c10 Charts About Sex\u201c? (Do it, it\u2019s worth all your attention.)\n\nFrom August 2010 to April 2011, OkTrends posts averaged a staggering 32,500 Facebook likes and 4,222 tweets.\n\nCo-founder Rudder says, \u201cHonestly I think the blog\u2013one way or another\u2013has driven a lot of our growth. Certainly, it has driven brand awareness. It\u2019s been the only thing we\u2019ve ever done, other than making a great dating site, that has gotten us out there into the world.\u201d\n\n**9: Etsy \u2013 harvested interest by reaching out to target communities before launching**\n\n[Etsy founders](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/etsy-marketing-strategy/) used to run a web design shop and were working on getcrafty.com for one of their projects, during which they discovered the need for a marketplace for handmade crafts.\n\nSo, while they built Etsy, they reached out to the craft community on getcrafty.com and Craftster.org, which had an even larger user base.\n\nBy the time they launched, they already had a lot of interest generated among the two platforms, and that helped get the required inventory and start off transactions on Etsy.\n\n**10: Buffer \u2013 got to 100k users primarily through frequent guest blogging**\n\nCo-founder Leo Wildrich wrote 150 guest posts in the first 9 months of running Buffer, and he swears by it. That\u2019s 16-17 posts per month, or more than 1 every two days!\n\n\u201cRelationships are actually the most valuable things that you gain from guest posting. At the end of the day, if you do a lot of guest posting you simply make a lot of friends. I\u2019ve got great friends over at Treehouse, Social Media Examiner, SocialMouths, and other great sites. You provide someone with free content, that\u2019s a great favor if you think about it, so it\u2019s a great opportunity to make friends with these awesome people.\u201d\n\n**11: ASOS \u2013 the ecommerce store mailed its own print magazine to 400,000 customers**\n\nBack in 2006, CEO Nick Robertson insisted that the glossy print catalog was still key to making the brand an essential part of customers\u2019 lives. Today, besides maintaining a content-rich site, ASOS also has a magazine with a circulation of 456,000 \u2013 the 18th largest in the UK, immediately behind Glamour and Closer, and just a handful of places behind New.\n\nUnconditional, free shipping was irresistable.\n\nOne of the things that kept customers flocking to ASOS was its incredible shipping and returns policy \u2013 even in its early days, ASOS was shipping for free and without minimum purchase. That policy has only just recently changed, but ASOS already has a loyal fanbase worldwide.\n\n**12 &amp; 13: Twitter and Foursquare \u2013 exploded their userbases at SXSW with guerrilla marketing**\n\n*SXSW 2007 \u2013 Twitter lived streamed the conference on huge plasma screens*\n\nCo-founder Evan Williams decided to visualize the service on 60 inch plasma screens in the hallways, because \u201cWe knew hallways were where the action was\u201d. Twitter created an event-specific feature that allowed attendees to follow a handful of \u201cambassadors\u201d.\n\nAccording to Newsweek\u2019s Steven Levy, \u201cHundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters. Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it.\u201d During the event, Twitter usage went from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000.\n\n*Foursquare \u2013 grew average check-ins from 250k to 350k with just chalk and rubber balls*\n\nFoursquare didn\u2019t have a booth like most other brands at the 2010 SXSW convention. Neither did it have Twitter\u2019s marketing budget (Twitter spent $11k on its SXSW campaign). Instead, it set up an actual game of \u201cfour square\u201d in front of the convention hall, which involved just chalk and two rubber balls.\n\nThe game drew thousands of walk-up participants [1], Said CEO Dennis Crowley, \u201cWe played all day long, and there was always a waiting line. We were handing out tee shirts, buttons, and stickers. Anytime someone didn\u2019t know what Foursquare was, we helped them find it on their phone. We helped get them up and running and using it.\u201d\n\n**14: Taskrabbit \u2013 focused on delighting moms in Boston**\n\nTaskrabbit first cornered the market with one mothers\u2019 group in Boston\n\nTaskrabbit is similar to Uber in its hyperlocal focus. Leah Busque talked about Taskrabbit\u2019s early traction in response to a question \u201cHow did you acquire your first 10,000 users?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can be tempting to just go really broad, really wide scale, really fast. But for us, we just focused on a customer segment. We focused on this mothers\u2019 group in Boston. And once we had cornered that market with that moms\u2019 group, those moms were talking to other moms on Beacon Hill and Backbay and Cambridge and it just spread from there.\u201d\n\n**15: Airbnb \u2013 shuttled from coast to coast to talk to their first users**\n\n*Founders went the extra mile for their earliest users*\n\nFounders Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk and Joe Gebbia acted on Paul Graham\u2019s advice in their Y Combinator days and \u201cdid things that didn\u2019t scale\u201d. Specifically, they went to NYC to acquire their earliest users, then followed up with them extensively.\n\n\u201cWhen New York took off, we flew back every weekend. We went door to door with cameras taking pictures of all these apartments to put them online. I lived in their living rooms. And home by home, block by block, communities started growing. And people would visit New York and bring the idea back with them to their city.\u201d \u2013 Brian Chesky, for The Atlantic\n\n\u201cBecause of the Democratic National Conventions, some people were using the site in New York and listing places. We would reach out to the very few people we had and get to know them, figure out what products they needed and what we could offer them. We tried to build loyalty knowing that if we did that, they would tell their friends. We\u2019d host parties and meetups and all sorts of different things. \n\nThrough that process, they\u2019d get very excited and tell their friends about Airbnb. It was mostly about generating as much buzz and excitement to get them to tell their friends about us.\u201d \u2013 Chesky, Startups Open-sourced\n\n*Airbnb believed in generating word-of-mouth, which would attract the press, which would generate more word-of-mouth*\n\n\u201cWe never dressed up in gorilla suits but we passed out fliers in coffee shops, train stations\u2014we did all sorts of things. I don\u2019t know what tactics worked more than others, but I think press was always the number one tactic for us. The press would spark another group of users, then we\u2019d go visit those people and talk to them and get them excited. It was a pattern that repeated itself.\u201d \u2013 Chesky, Startups Open-sourced\n\n**16: Yelp \u2013 grew a loyal user base by rewarding quality reviews**\n\n*Gave \u201cKudos\u201d for good behavior*\n\nYelp wanted to create a tight community of consistent reviewers and high quality reviews. It rightly guessed that people were more likely to write in-depth, well crafted reviews when their names appeared alongside them. So it offered special recognition to users who were first to review a business, and let other users give kudos for reviews that are useful, funny, or cool.\n\nAnd the numbers in 2006 show that most Yelp reviewers got hooked on the site:\n\nUsers who contributed 6 or more reviews:\n\nCitySearch \u2013 4.8%\nYahoo Local \u2013 11.1%\nYelp \u2013 65.8%\nUsers who left only one review:\n\nCitySearch \u2013 71.2%\nYahoo Local \u2013 56.4%\nYelp \u2013 9.2%\n\n*Treated their best \u201cElite\u201d users generously*\n\nThe most engaged Yelp users are elevated to \u201cElite\u201d status, visible by a shiny Elite badge on their account profile. By 2006, a full 44% of reviews on the site were contributed by Yelp Elite. \n\nDave Kim, a six-year Yelp Elite user with over 900 reviews, explains:\n\n\u201cYelp does a good job of finding ways to reward people, not through monetary means, but little perks \u2026 At regular Yelp Events, Elites often got first-chance to RSVP and even got in an hour before everyone else. There are specific events just for Yelp Elite that offer free food and drinks and swag.\u201d\n\n**17: Groove \u2013 reached out to the customers that \u201cgot away\u201d**\n\nCEO Alex Turnbull has written a very detailed analysis of Groove\u2019s early customer acquisition tactics, along the theme of doing things that don\u2019t scale. The tactic that stood out the most was scrapping \u2013 reaching out to customers who chose other competitors, and sincerely asking the reasons for their choice. From the exercise, Turnbull discovered and fixed several bugs, and convince customers to give Groove another chance.\n\n\n",

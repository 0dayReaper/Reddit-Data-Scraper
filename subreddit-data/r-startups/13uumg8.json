    "postText": "Hey,\n\nI would like some advice on how I should approach my plan to start a company. Namely how would you think I should approach things if I don\u2019t find a viable idea/team. \n\nMy plan:\n\n-\tI want to start a company/startup. \n-\tI will give myself 9 months to find an idea/team. 6 of those months I will be working full time. And the last 3 months I won\u2019t have a day job.\n-\tfor the next 6 months I will focus on ideas I have for problems I have seen and encountered. If any idea is promising I will build a co-founding team from within my network. \n-\tif I don\u2019t find anything in this period, for the last 3 months, I will resort to stuff like co founder matching sites to meet folks that have domain expertise + idea I can join forces with. Doing this last because during this period I won\u2019t have a job so it will be easier to do trial projects, meet people, etc. as I understand this stuff is time consuming. \n\nWhat I am unsure is what to do if I don\u2019t find a suitable idea/team/project after this period. I basically have two options:\n\n-\t(A) work on some smaller ideas of mine. I have a few ideas of info-products I could sell that could earn me some money and buy me some time. These aren\u2019t life changing sums or ambitious enough though so I don\u2019t want to do this for too long. Can potentially start this once my 3 month break starts. \n-\t(B) join a Seed or Series A startup to get some early employee equity. There\u2019s a few startups in this bucket that I think it would be cool to join. But I think it is mostly a distraction for me since it will only make it harder for me to work on my own thing. I tend to stay at places for 3-4 years.\n\nAny thoughts on this plan? Mostly trying to figure out ways to manter the most of tua period.",

            "comment": "It seems like you're putting a lot of time pressure on yourself. If you are really committed to running a business and you have fairly constrained personal finances then I suggest having a separate full-time or part-time job while you're in the first stages. That will give you breathing room so that if it takes 12 months instead of 9 months you aren't freaking out and going into crazy debt. You should still hold yourself accountable to timelines as you've described (great thinking on that), but having some wiggle room is valuable. One of the reasons that's needed is because some ideas can take off pretty quickly, while others may need several years before you get notable traction and/or revenue.",

Just go get a job. You will learn much more and will be exposed to customers and their problems. Wait until you have an idea and more experience before trying to build your own company. If you have an idea, the first thing you should do is interview a dozen potential customers, not friends or family, and listen carefully.",

Secondary reasons are creating something with a much bigger impact than myself, challenging myself in a different way, working with others on something ambitious. \n\nI am not too focused on a specific area or topic.

Mostly want to work on something that I can build. \n\nI have had jobs and they weren\u2019t that useful to getting ideas of problems to solve beyond the scope of the product I was working on.

I started something which I think has great potential but i have no time for the follow through. I have heaps of ideas in my little black book but no time or capital to see them through. So my suggestion to you seeing as your going to be in a position of success with no choice of failure. Start something you have a passion for. Something that you won't give up on, even if it is a smaller idea. Get your feet wet, build up contacts and meet like minded people who can help you with your bigger ideas.\n\nIt's better to start something and pivot than to not start something because you don't know what is right. At the end of the day you may find out it's not for you and option B might be the better way to go. The sooner you start the longer you have to figure that out and when it's crunch time you can go in with a solid direction/idea of what you are capable of.\n\nGood luck and I hope it all works out ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)",

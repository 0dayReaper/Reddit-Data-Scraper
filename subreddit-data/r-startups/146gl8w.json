I used to run my business full-time but took perm roles and long term contracts about 10 years ago and I'm ramping up my business again and I need to figure out where my target audience is at. \n\nthanks",

Most of them are no longer in business, and those who still are in business remain legacy clients that I kept or have moved on because I no longer lived in the area.\n\nI'm not even sure if my rates are too low or not. I've done some research and I think I'm on track there. I've asked about rates on Alignable and got everything from \"it doesn't matter what you charge if you do good work\" to \"charge based on where you live\"... Which isn't helpful.",

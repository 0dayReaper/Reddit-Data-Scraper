    "postText": "I have been using my own funding from work, my Roth, family and friends who are crazy enough to help, in order to move forward in my business. I can't lie, it started as a hobby and a side hustle, but it got recognition quickly and I was convinced that it could take off and became more dedicated to develop it. To answer your question, it's a clothing store, where I've created my own brands and styles. I know the fashion industry is like a race in wet cement, but I'm so committed and so passionate about it. But now, I'm doing my marketing, product development, and hiring an extra hand or two, and I've got a proverbial wall using my resources from my job (still gotta pay bills). Now I'm considering applying for business credit for a reasonable and manageable amount of 5,000. Nothing too high, I have to be realistic. Does anyone have any stories about doing this for their business? Please share and thank you.",

Super easy to manage, too. They offered 20K, and my bank only offered 5K, which wasn't very helpful with that business.",

After a couple years of solid performance, paying it off every month I can qualify for a proper higher credit limit across AMEX, Chase and others.",

You're done. \n\nBut first you should seriously consider whether it's worth going into debt for this project $5k is effectively nothing in this game. My recommendation would be to bootstrap as much as possible with the cash you have and get some revenue to reinvest.  You'll burn through 5k really quickly with little to show for it.",

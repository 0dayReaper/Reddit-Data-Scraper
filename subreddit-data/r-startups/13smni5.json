I get new ideas all the time, and most of them don't work out. It's all about making it happen and nobody, or extremely few developers will build an app for you just because you got an idea. Just telling you straight up how it is. It's great that you have something you believe in, but either you got to buckle up and learn it yourself or pay a large sum to build it.",

I guess you should test your idea without an app - it can save you money and time before you will start an app development part.\n\nCreate a landing with you idea with the button like \u201ccontact after launch\u201d or find a lot of respondents to understand is the problem that your startup is going to solve is actually REAL and people are ready to pay for your solution.\n\nBest of luck anyway!",

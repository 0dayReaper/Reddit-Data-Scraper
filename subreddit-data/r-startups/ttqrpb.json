    "postText": "For the last 2-ish years, I've been running a fully-remote, global startup.  We don't have offices. We don't use time tracking apps. We hardly have Zoom calls. And... We're spead out over roughly a dozen countries (the digital nomads on the team make this a hard number to count).\n\nWhich brings me to this post: Communication. Most remote teams try to import the office OS into their remote working environment\u2013\u2013which means lots of synchronous communication, like meetings. But, this really doesn't work. Below, I'll share what I've learned about communication at my startup. I hope you'll find it interesting.\n\n**The one-sentence summary:** Good remote startups (and teams, in general) default to asynchronous communication.\n\n* **Async communication =** Communication that doesn\u2019t happen in real-time (for example, emails are a classic example of asynchronous communication. Slack messages, when not carried out as a full, real-time conversation, are also asynchronous.)\n\nAsync is the bedrock of a good communication system while remote. You simply can't expect a global, fully-distributed team to be sitting on Zoom at odd hours. **More importantly,** meeting culture kills productivity. Every time somebody has to be on a meeting, they're not doing the actual work you're paying them to do.\n\nAsync work is really important. And here are a few practical ways I've implemented it at my company:\n\n**1.** **Create clear communication norms across your entire startup.**\n\nWe have, literally, a flow chart that helps people understand how they should communicate something. For example, if someone external is involved, the default is email. If it's a quick, internal message **and** it's extremely time-sensitive (say, action is required within a few hours), we use DMs on Slack. If it's a thoughtful conversation, or one that doesn't require immediate action, we use a forum-like platform that's built to host these sorts of conversations.\n\nBy creating communication norms, you can make sure everyone's communicating the same way\u2013\u2013and that people aren't getting ripped out of deep work by meaningless notifications. This is basically communicating from first principles: You're breaking down your means of communication to their basic parts to identify what should be said where.\n\n**2. Get better at writing.**\n\nMost of us are bad at writing. This is true for both you, as a founder, and everyone who works at your startup. But, most async communication happens in a written format. Which means that you, and your team, should study what good written communication looks like. Once you've defined rules for what good written communication means at your startup, put it into a Notion doc (or similar) so everyone can follow the same handbook.\n\n**3. Get as close to 0 meetings as you can.\\***\n\n\\*You're probably won't ever have 0 meetings on a remote team, and you probably shouldn't. But, recognize what meetings should and shouldn't be used for. Examples:\n\n* **Meetings are great for brainstorming jam sessions + teambuilding.** When your team is spread across the world, it's important that they do actually *talk* to each other. A profile picture on Slack isn't enough.\n* **Meetings aren't great for 99% of other stuff.** Anything outside of focused jam sessions, weekly team updates, and teambuilding probably shouldn't be a meeting.\n\n**Something crazy you can try:** If you're finding it hard to get rid of meetings, try a completely async week at your startup. As in, a week where you don't have *a single meeting*. See how it goes. It probably won't be ideal, but it'll help you realize what things you may not need meetings for. We tried this about a month back and it was really insightful.\n\n**That's it for this post --** I just wanted to share a few thoughts on how communication looks at a fully-remote startup. I've begun writing similar posts on this for innovation, wellness, and knowledge systems. If you enjoyed this one, let me know and I can make this a series :)\n\n(Edit for context: The reason our startup is so spread-out and global is because our actual product makes it possible for people to hire &amp; pay &amp; run global teams. So... We practice what we preach, and it's not as much of a hassle since we've got the systems in place for it.)\n\n...\n\nTo close, if you're doubting me on meetings, here's a quick thought experiment:\n\nImagine somebody is working a classic 9-to-5. They've got one meeting scheduled for 11 AM and another for 3 PM. It's my theory that, in this scenario, that person has lost \\~90% of their productive time that day. With just two meetings.\n\n**This is why:** They get to work, check some emails, and they've already got the spectre of that 11 AM meeting hanging over their head. They won't get into any serious deep work before the meeting, because they know it'll get cut off at 11.\n\nOK, they have the 11 AM meeting. Then they've got lunch. After lunch, they (once again) only have an hour or two before their next meeting. This isn't enough time for most people to get into a serious deep flow state. So they get some things done, but not much. Then that 3 PM meeting is over, and they've got roughly an hour before their day is over. Nobody gets intense deep work done in the final hour of the day, as a general rule.\n\nSo... That's where \\~90% of their effort went. Gone. It's not just the meetings that waste productivity. It's the way those meetings interact with the rest of the time in your day.\n\nHopefully this makes sense :) It's something we've been passionate about at my startup.",

By limiting when a meeting can appear, you protect that opportunity for flow.",

We have 2 hours set aside every day for Flow/deep work. During this time we are not allowed to have meetings or slack each other. It's our time to get the most important and deepest work done in the day. We are hoping to share this practice with other teams!!",

Here is my experience, could you tell me what you think is the issue?  \nI recently switched from a team with \\~4-5 meetings/week to a team with just 1 short meeting/week and it's been a big challenge. Most of my questions do not get satisfying answers by writing and I often feel like a quick meeting would make us progress so much faster, by allowing a lot more information to be exchanged, and eliminate many of the misunderstandings (and frustrations) happening in written communication.",

I think sync and async communication should work hands in hands \ud83e\udd1d  It's not always binary, it depends on the context.

Actually my team and I, we're working on facilitating async communication by using the power of voicenotes and making them more transparent, searchable and collaborative.

If they have the same manager or product owner, the meetings can't overlap. So now your manager is spending 45-75 mins every single day just to keep up with the progress of the teams they manage. If a single important person can't make the meeting, the whole meeting gets rescheduled, impacting everyone.\n\nWith asynchronous communication, the manager gets caught up in as long as it takes them to read the status updates. The individual contributors don't get slowed down sitting in a meeting waiting their turn.\n\nHave you ever worked at an early stage startup? The idea that there is no collaboration is asinine. We have one product we are building. That's literally the only focus of the entire company.",

Verbal is shit for planning; people don't remember 100% what they were told, they have no way to go back and refer to a verbal conversation to refresh their memory if they forget, and memories can't be text-searched, linked to, or forwarded to people to get them all on the same page.\n\nThere is a reason that for centuries, one of the staples of meetings has been having someone to take minutes (and usually) distribute them. But why make that a whole manual thing when people can just write what they were going to say or ask and have everyone who needs to read it and (where necessary) answer it at their convenience? In fact, often being able to do so even *before* a meeting on the subject would take place, thus reducing or negating the need for said meeting at all?",

You have to tell people to come in, for example, from 9 to 5. But, when people work remotely, they can do their work whenever they want. So instead of trying to helicopter-parent our team, we judge performance based on level and quality of output.\n\nIt's an idea that gets a really strong gut reaction from some people, but isn't *that* counterintuitive when it's fully explained.",

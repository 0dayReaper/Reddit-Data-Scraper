Acquiring the data on our own may not be the most efficient approach, especially if we aim to launch quickly and conduct further market testing. There is also no open-source alternative available. I am wondering if there are alternative methods apart from reaching out to organizations or companies individually via email to inquire about the availability of the dataset I'm searching. Would love to have other AI founders chime in and share their experiences on how they tackled similar issue(s) in their their data acquisition process!",

If you are taking external data only (ie public data or even for sale data), you are kinda turning the data into a commodity. Which is ok...when you start. The key is think of a way that incentivizes your users or companies to give you that data when they use your product. For example, we are comparing pricing and risk for a type of proposal. We have public domain data. We tell our users hey give us your proposals and we will use our AI to correlate any relevant info from yours (how accurate is the pricing on yours, should it be moved up). This way as part of the product experience you are enriching your user experience for your users and better data. Just a thought! Remember most data plays are better as a layered on part of an existing product. That is why all of the big companies are going to town on AI because they have the data lying around.",

    "postText": "\ud83d\udd0e As a startup founder, I am always asked, \"What problem does your product solve?\" The expectation is that each innovation should address a real, tangible problem, bringing significant value to its users.  \n\ud83d\udcc8 The current buzz in the tech world is all about the Apple Vision Pro. While it's a marvel of technology, presenting impressive feats of AR/VR, the question remains:  \n\u2753 What customer pain point does it actually solve?  \n\ud83d\udef8 Often, we find ourselves enamored with the 'next big thing', the shiny new gadget, losing sight of the essential purpose of innovation: to alleviate real problems and bring about meaningful improvements in people's lives. AR/VR certainly opens doors to many exciting possibilities \u2013 enhanced gaming experiences, immersive tourism, and sophisticated medical simulations, to name a few. But do these improvements truly cater to pressing customer needs, or are they merely incremental enhancements riding the wave of novelty?  \n\ud83d\udd12 This distinction is especially crucial for startups. While larger companies may have the resources to invest in advanced, experimental tech, startups must remain laser-focused on problem-solving. Our innovations are born out of necessity, aiming to fill gaps and provide solutions to issues that affect our users' everyday lives.  \n\ud83d\udd11 In this era of constant innovation, let's not forget the heart of technology: to make our lives better, easier, and more fulfilling. Let's ensure that our focus stays on solving real-world problems, not just pursuing the next shiny thing. \ud83c\udfaf #Startups #AppleVisionPro #ProblemSolving #EdTech #Innovation #VR #AR",

Sure, many jurisdictions have government tax credit and funding programs that will help offset the costs of just that sort of project, and sometimes it's investor capital, but what's *really* the difference between \"own cash\" and \"investor cash\"? Everyone wants to see a return on their investment - government included most of the time - but have a risk tolerance, and some amount of capital can be spent on things with really low payoff expectancy, so long as the company's existence and profitability isn't completely tethered to that risk.\n\nCompanies like Google have experimented with things like [20% time](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/16/google-20-percent-rule-shows-exactly-how-much-time-you-should-spend-learning-new-skills.html), and as I said -- a lot of what we have in the world of personal computing literally came not from entrepreneurship, but hobbyism. Entrepreneurship can often come *from* passion and love and exploration, rather than the other way around.\n\nSo I guess all of that to say:\n\n&gt; What is the Apple Vision Pro, and what problem does it solve?  \nAnswer: It doesn't need to solve a problem.\n\n&gt; Is it a technological vanity project?  \nAnswer: Sure, but there is nothing wrong with that, and as you've pointed out, it represents a major leap forward in the technology space.\n\n&gt; Will it be successful?  \nAnswer: It doesn't really matter.\n\nTaking a skunkworks project like this and monetizing it, however, is where the entrepreneurial side comes in. You shouldn't be asking \"What problem does it solve?\". As an entrepreneur yourself, you should be asking \"What problem *can* it solve?\".\n\nAnd actually, this is part of Apple's business model. There is a reason this product was introduced at WWDC (developer's conference). Apple is a technology ecosystem, and this is just another extension of that ecosystem. Two big parts of what makes their offering rich (double entendre) and them successful as a company is people being a) Invested in that ecosystem and b) Developing *for* that ecosystem.",

Separately, watching sports has become the ultimate entertainment globally. Media rights budgets are already staggeringly high and some sports attract viewers by the 100's of millions worldwide. Yet, 10's of thousands of people chanting in  a stadium brings an elating atmosphere that's hard to describe to someone who hasn't experienced it first hand. Sometimes you may feel part of that atmosphere watching a NBA, Notre Dame or Liverpool game from your screen, but nothing comes close to being there. Maybe AR can help bring that atmosphere to spectators and fans far remote. It's likely to be expensive at first, but it would still be less than cost of traveling, accommodation and game tickets and available all the time to a countrywide and global audience. If you can bring me that from the comfort of my home I'll probably buy in. I would also expect a close up / replay  experience to help capture the virtuosity and genius of certain encounters. That would be augmented reality. There's probably millions of people who would have loved to experience the world cup final atmosphere as if they were there, and to see in close up Messi or Mbappe dribble past opponents , get goaded or even fouled in close up... experience as if you're sitting in the stands and then get the multiple angles, close up options as well, at the same time or in replay",

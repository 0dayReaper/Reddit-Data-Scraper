    "postText": "Hi there!\n\nI'm part of a startup development team, and we need some advice on project management tools. Our team has been working tirelessly, and recently we experienced significant growth, adding team members from different parts of the world. With this expansion, we need another way than chats for effective communication.\n\nMy friends and I don't have much background in planning and managing, and since there are so many tools like [gantpro.com](https://ganttpro.com/project-management-tool/?utm_channel=reddit&amp;utm_channel=reddit) available, making a choice becomes complicated. I'd greatly appreciate your insights and recommendations based on your experiences.\n\nHere are a few specific points we're looking for in a planning tool:\n\n1. Workflow and task management: We are searching for a tool that could allow us to create, assign, and track tasks, set deadlines, and monitor progress. A user-friendly interface and the ability to prioritize and categorize tasks would be ideal.\n2. Team collaboration and communication: It should have features like real-time messaging, file sharing, and version control to ensure everyone is on the same page and can easily exchange ideas and feedback.\n3. Time tracking and scheduling: It would be immensely helpful to have a tool to track and manage our time effectively. This includes features such as time logging, scheduling, and the ability to set milestones and dependencies.\n4. Project visualization and reporting: We want a tool that provides clear and intuitive visualizations of our project's progress: charts, boards, and other reporting capabilities that can help us monitor milestones, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions.\n5. Cost and affordability: We're a startup and don't have much money, so preferably something free or not too expensive.\n\nPlease let me know if anything comes to your mind. Thanks in advance for your help.",

Also can be used for project management but more on that below. \n\n- Project management: Linear. Generous free plan. Better than Notion for task management in my opinion, which can be tricky to set up for project-based frameworks. \n\nIf you want to save costs you can just use Notion, though. They\u2019ve launched a couple of new features that make it easier to use it to track projects, like sub tasks and project view. I haven\u2019t tried those features though so take it with a grain of salt.",

I'm recently using Notion to manage multiple projects.\n\nBasecamp is another best project management tools I like. I did use it in my previous projects. \n\nWhat I suggest is, check both Notion and Basecamp for free. Both are giving free for trial period and you can choose.",

You can do pretty much everything in Notion. \n\nYes there are better tools that do parts of Notion better, but I believe that Notion is good enough. And that really is the balance you want to strike for your core tool. Then add high speciality tools on top of that.   \nThis is my 2c, do your own research. But StackOver flow rated Notion as top in their last developer survey. So it's an easy bet.",

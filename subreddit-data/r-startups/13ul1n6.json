    "postText": "I\u2019ve been toying with a few ideas but I always stop myself once I realize how complex it really is to develop applications. I know close to nothing about app development/backend development (more of a data science guy). It sucks because I\u2019d love to see some of these ideas come to fruition, at least a working MVP, but I have a huge mountain to get over *first*. \n\nAre there ways to meet with very skilled developers in person or online and not fear them taking your ideas and Zuckerberging you? If possible I wouldn\u2019t even want to give equity to said person(s), as I\u2019ve done that before and led to mixed results. Can I just pay someone to make me app/ web app MVPs? \n\nFor reference I\u2019m a broke 21 year old uni student and some of these app ideas I think of while baked. I\u2019m located in Austin, TX.\n\nEDIT: I have about $1000 saved up to use for these ideas at the moment.",

For example if your app had to have a messaging feature you could look into tutorials for making making a messaging app, then if you had to have a posting feature you could look up tutorials that would help you with this process.\n\nAfter you have done this to the best of your ability, Apply for pitch competitions. Most universities I\u2019ve seen host pitch comps. There are statewide pitch comps you could also look into. For these comps you want your business to be as coherent as possible, demonstrating actual products and having user feedback and stats will help a lot. There are usually cash prizes for winning and this could help you a lot as well as give you credibility. \n\nThere are also resources that your state and university allocate for entrepreneurs and towards startups. I would look into these resources. This should be enough to help you for now. All the best, hope things go well",

If you have some super-innovative \"secret sauce\" then you can withhold the specific details of that in your first conversations (before you sign an NDA), but other than that I'd suggest being very open. You need to work on something you're passionate about, and if someone else who isn't passionate about that tries to go start a business doing it, they will fail.",

Break it into very small features, then break those features into multiple individual functions, then write those functions line by line.\n\nEventually that single simple first line of code becomes that intimidating complex app and by that time you are no longer a newbie.\n\nTake it slow, piece by piece, line by line. You got this!\n\nEDIT: If I were in your shoes (I am in my 0s and have been coding for 13+ years) I would subscribe to Brad Traversy's Youtube Channel (Traversy Media), take $75 from that $1000 and purchase his Udemy courses, and spend 6 months learning how to code HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, and PHP (this is specifically for web dev as that's what Brad focuses on, but the gist is the same even if the languages are different). Then I'd go and build these ideas myself.\n\nI'd also, listen to all of the IndieHacker Podcast episodes to listen to how people just like you built multi-million dollar apps and SAAS and other things with code - many never knowing how to code beforehand.\n\nI'd listen to the few talks on YouTube by a guy named Pieter Levels and how he build his own projects while teaching himself how to code - some of which make $40k+ per month EACH.\n\nAt 21 you have all the time in the world and there is no need to rush. Spend the next 3-6 months learning and listening to the above. As you do, start to code. A year from now you'll be asking much different questions and might even have 1 or 2 low earning side projects that you built YOURSELF.\n\nEDIT EDIT: I have zero affiliation with anyone or anything I mentioned in this post.",

I have tried many similar products like [Bubble](https://bubble.io/login), [Webflow](https://webflow.com/), and I would recommend the tool I recently use, [Momen](https://momen.app/?channel=reddit-complexapp), which I have been using recently. It offers several advantages, including a built-in backend, eliminating the need for external integrations and enabling seamless development. It also supports third-party API integration, and its pricing is reasonable. By overcoming this technical hurdle, I believe your entrepreneurial ideas can be easily realized. Wishing you success!",

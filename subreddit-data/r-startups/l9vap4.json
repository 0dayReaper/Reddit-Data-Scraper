Subscriptions give the user access for unlimited content (some platforms have PPV as addon), others have the user watch interruptive ads. \n\nOn Centx you have two types of videos:\n\nAdvertising material: Audio or video files uploaded by you. You upload the file, set a price (limited price for beta) per second. Yes! Per second. Users will check your ad out and GET PAID (by you) per seconds. **Ex.:**If you upload a 30 seconds video, and set US$ 0.01/second every user (who watches it till the end) will get US$ 0.30 - fee (right now 5%). You can filter the audience and budget for your video as well.\n\nSome ideas: Advertising your business locally, your Centx channel and pay people to listen to what you have to say.\n\nCreators material: Audio or video files uploaded by you. You upload the file, set a price (limited price for beta) per second. In this case the user will PAY to check out your material. You will GET PAID per seconds. **Ex.:** If you upload a 12 minutes (720 seconds) video, and set US$ 0.001/second every user (who watch it till the end) will PAY you US$ 0.72 - fee (right now 5%). \n\nAny user can upload both material. Revenue coming from ads can be withdrawn, used to watch/listen to other user material or to fund your own advertising campaign. You pay/get paid just once for a media.\n\nSome ideas: Crowdsource or donation (upload a video or audio, tell the story and charge for it, supporters will watch it till the end). You can sell your homemade movie, your tutorials, audiobook and podcast.\n\nCentx player has a cent-o-meter (cents will be transfer synced with seconds). Check it out.\n\n* **More details:** What stage are you in? How many employees or founders?\n\n**Stage**:Beta testing stage.

We believe that the menu experience should be mobile, smart and enlightening.We created a SaaS where restaurant owners are able to create menus and edit them in real-time and can be shared with a simple QR Code or a link. All of it can be done in a browser and even in the phone. This allows us to bring features that restaurants can't afford, like online ordering and paying, re-targeting, analytics, dynamic pricing, or running A/B tests. (Most of this features are still work-in-progress)\n* **More details:**\n   * Demo: [https://view.menuplate.app/djdaps/75061390-2766-4cc1-a70b-facd55da385d](https://view.menuplate.app/djdaps/75061390-2766-4cc1-a70b-facd55da385d)\n   * **Stage: Validation.** We provide our service completely free and we want to arrive as many restaurants as possible.\n   * **Role:** We are 3 friends that worked at Typeform and currently 2 Engineers and 1 Product designer, but I'm more doing stuff out of the engineering tasks.\n* **Looking for:** At this point, we're looking to help restaurants and since it's a market overflowed by offers and services, we are looking for ways to arrive at restaurants in a scalable but honest way. So, any ideas are very welcome :P",

I'm working with Max to build on and improve the tool, I've been posting here for a couple of years so thought I'd see what the community has to offer!",

I wanted an app to keep track of everything I've read or might want to read later on, since so much of my reading is online these days, and one comes accross more interesting links in a day than one can possibly read.  Digraph gives me a way to save those links in a place where I'll be able to find them later on. Weeks or months later I can browse whole topics of interesting blog posts and news articles that I didn't have time to read initially.\n\nI've been using the app almost every day, several times a day, since sometime in 2018, so I think it meets a need and has potential to be useful to others.  Right now I'm just mulling over the presentation and packaging without rushing things.

As Charles Bukowski wrote \"Can you remember who you were before the world told you who you should be?\" and that's the sentiment we're going for. User feedback includes \"brilliant\", \"special\", and \"it might change history\". Try it out and see for yourself!\n* **More details** Version 2 of Immaterial is live on Android, and we're currently working on the iOS/Windows/Mac/Linux/Web versions aka Immaterial 3\n* **Looking for:**   At the moment we're looking for early adopters and investment for our 2-person team to go full-time and expand. Our website features all our features and different use cases if you don't have Android!",

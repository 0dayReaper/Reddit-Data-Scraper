Basically office hours when there are questions and a pretty typical stream by a mediocre gamer when there aren\u2019t. If you\u2019ve got questions about basic corporate law, mergers and acquisitions, startups, venture capital or just law in general, feel free to stop by and ask away. I\u2019ll generally be streaming on Monday and Friday nights and Sunday afternoon, so this will be a regular thing. Will periodically have specific topics I\u2019ll talk about on Mondays, but tonight is just open.\n\n**Location:** I'm a US attorney based in NYC, so can't answer questions about non-US law.\n\n**Goals**: Hopefully this will be a good resource for folks.\n\n**Notes:** I\u2019m subject to ethical rules and so there are some things I can\u2019t do on Twitch (i.e., I can\u2019t give legal advice). I can answer questions like: \u201cWhat do you think about 50/50 structures?\u201d, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a SAFE and a convertible note?\u201d, \u201cHow do you sell a sole proprietorship?\u201d  I can't answer questions like: \u201cMy company has three founders. We have no revenue, but we\u2019ve got great technology. My nephew is a jerk. A friend wants to invest $250,000 in a SAFE with a valuation cap. What should my valuation cap be? I also think my co-founders don\u2019t do enough work. Can I fire them?\u201d So please don\u2019t get too specific or push for that sort of thing.  If you want that sort of specific advice you really need to formally consult with an attorney.",

That's right, more of 2 months of your salary for that one message on LinkedIn or an advert on a job site.\n\n**Paul:** But I am a consultant, I don't have a fixed yearly income.\n\n**Chani:** Well, that's even worse, they get at least 15% from each day of your work, until your contract ends.\n\n**Paul:** Impossible, are you saying that they were getting 15% of all my income for the last 3 years, since they got me a job in the BigCompany Inc?\n\n**Chani:** Correctomundo\n\n**Paul:** I never noticed anything on my invoices. All the money goes straight to my account.\n\n**Chani:** That's correct, because it's illegal in UK and many other countries to charge an employee for finding him a job. But it's your employer, the BigCompany Inc. who pays them their fee.\n\n**Paul:** In that case it's not my problem.\n\n**Chani:** Oh yes it is, BigCompany could pay you that 15%-20% extra from the very beginning. But they gave you less, so they could accommodate the recruiter fee. So it is very much your problem.\n\n**Paul:** I had my daily rate increased last week...\n\n**Chani:** Just like your recruiter\n\n**Paul:** What?! I will never get rid of him then! If I only knew, I would apply directly on the BigCompany careers website and never used that blood sucking recruiter agency! I wanted to work for one of the top 20 companies in London anyway. But who has time to browse 20 corporation websites everyday to avoid recruiters?\n\n**Chani:** I have got  something for you... [itjobslondon.co.uk](https://itjobslondon.co.uk). It has jobs from largest companies only, no recruiters, direct links to career pages. Next time, save yourself that 20%, mate.\n\n*Inspiration to building that website was my own experience as an IT consultant in London. Me and all my colleagues were in the same position, where a recruitment agency was 'taxing' us for finding the job in a big firm. By finding job I mean sending us a message on LinkedIn or us applying on a job site, while their only task was to arrange an interview. These guys could not be avoided without paying them heavy fines. I promised myself that in future I will only apply directly on the careers pages and avoid recruiters at all cost. I built the website to make it a bit easier.*\n\n**More details:**\n\nThe job offers are gathered automagically, not posted or advertised by a third party (at this stage)\n\n**What life cycle stage is your startup at?**\n\nIt's quite easy to scale the website to other regions/countries. However, I am stuck on getting traffic to the website. There are some big players in the job hunting industry and I don't know how to get even on ANY page in search engines. SEO is limited because I don't create much content (only links). Advertising could work but my page does not bring any income (no ads and paid content ATM). Social media, well, how do promote such a website on Instagram? This is not about makeup tutorials or travelling, this is about boring jobs! I guess same issue with guest blogging.\n\nIf I do have traffic though, I would include email alerts and paid adverts.\n\n**How could** r/startups **help?**\n\nPlease help with:\n\n1.

We've been around a few years, but only raised a small amount of cash a year ago, and have about 7-8 months of runway left. There's so much competition in this space (which is increasing every month) that it's a really tough industry to be in. Currently only making about $2.8K/m with a $17K/m burn rate (we launched paid plans in Feb of this year), so the race is on to increase the first number in the next seven months!\n\n**Your role?** CEO, though honestly with only 3 people it's mostly development, support, and whatever needs to be done.\n\n**What goals are you trying to reach this month?** This month is a huge pain because we have dozens of things we want to get done, but we've seen a huge influx in people trying to hack the site (mostly just script kiddies), and crawl/steal our data. It used to be easy to fix (ban a user agent or IP) but recently it's all been DDOS-like crawlers from hundreds of IP addresses (including Tor) with no easily blockable user agent and that something like fail2ban finds difficult to detect, esp as it's from multiple people/services. It's especially frustrating because I've spent 3 years working on this without pay and also investing my own cash (we're currently paying the other two co-founders but I'm not taking anything), so it's dis-heartening when people just crawl the site and grab data as quickly as they can, putting additional load on our servers and costing us even more money. I understand it, but it's frustrating nonetheless!\n\n**How could** r/startups **help?** If you invest in stocks and want to keep track of certain companies, then sign up and add them as favorites. You can add up to 50 for free, and you'll get new filings as they're published, and a daily (or weekly) email with personalised news/reddit threads/etc that match your favorites. And feel free to email us with your suggestions please (though you may have to wait a few days for a response given I'm freaking out about all the things we have to do!)",

I have always had the idea of starting a Bloomberg Terminal, but for data trading, though I don\u2019t remotely have the skill set to execute that vision, I just think it\u2019s a multi billion dollar unicorn. That said, I absolutely LOVE this idea and think it is fucking brilliant. If this scales, you can even offer multi-year horizons for legitimate corporations (i.e. if a SaaS platform brings in $1M monthly in subscription revs but needs $100M to finance the purchase of HQ, an option would be for them to seek investors through this platform for a multi-year contract that hinges on growth modeling etc., could even incorporate some level of options/futures)\n\nObviously your project is for funding startups, but if this takes off you can pivot to literally be the platform for full blown subscription commoditization. On a technical note, I\u2019m not sure I would compare these to stocks though \u2014 as far as an asset class, it feels more like fixed income to me. You should consider getting a Bloomberg terminal for a month because it will give you so much insight and ideas on how to build this out.\n\nAnother thought as well is to incorporate creators into this platform, given they will exponentially grow in numbers and ability to monetize their virtual presence with the rise of Web 3.0. For example, if someone who brings in $50,000/month from 10,000 newsletter subscriptions, they could list those.

It was born out of my personal frustration that even in the age of the internet, something great could be happening in the building next to you, and you wouldn't know it unless you had checked out the Twitter or Facebook account that they were advertising on, or managed to find it in the not so great UIs of Eventbrite and Meetup.\n\nThe events space is currently a tangled mess of for-profit platforms, and open-source platforms trying to fill in the gaps. This is our attempt at solving that problem.\n\n**Value proposition:**\\-\n\n\\- A platform made equally for Event discovery, and organisation\n\n\\- A better UI for searching for events\n\n\\- A means to promote your event on our platform\n\n\\- A way of minimizing no-shows and collecting donations at the same time\n\n\\- No fees for being an Organiser\n\nHere's a sample image of our UI - [https://i.imgur.com/tp1YDTb.png](https://i.imgur.com/tp1YDTb.png)\n\n**What life cycle stage is your startup at?** \\- Discovery. \n\n**What goals are you trying to reach this month?** \\- Finishing some more critical MVP features and signing up beta users (we're being featured on Betalist this month \ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udd1e)\n\n**How could** r/startup **help?** \\- Feedback on frustrations with existing event apps and features you'd find useful would be great - just tweet @radiusHQ!",

We want to disseminate as much useful information as we can to people wanting to visit Namibia so they know where they can find anything they want or need. \n\nAdditional details: In the discovery phase of the start up, building the relationships with the Namibian companies and beginning the dissemination of information to people curious about Namibia. Still a lot of work to do lol \n\nGoals for this month: Release 10 blog posts of the most searched keywords in the tourism realm of Namibia. Have at least 10 companies/places we believe will give the best customer experience under their respective header category. \n\nHow r/startup could help: Probably suggesting what they would want to know and the services they would need before coming to Namibia. Or what they would like information on. And UI recommendations \n\nDiscount: This is the baby phase of the start up, but when I build up relationships with some companies in the country. I could land some discounts for people who come through my site and the early people who helped with suggestions will be offered it.\n\nShoutout to anyone from NA \u270c\ufe0f",

Changing shelter again and again also creates problem in shifting because of goods. In many cases shelterowner misbehave with students,they thrash or abuse students also.\n\nBy observing these problems I came up with an idea to solve problems associated in these field of both parties.\nI have decided to develope an app where there will be listing of pgs,homes, and flats which owner want to rent\nAny student or bachelor new to city can use the app to find shelter on the basis of ratings and reviews of each particular shelter\nIt will also contain features such as ease of shifting and protection of student and owner rights so that they don't clash.\n\nI want to ask all the guys out there will this idea work?\nValuable views and suggestions are most welcome",

                            "comment": "Thanks for taking out time to read our post. Frankly we get this question a lot.\n\nOn the onset CloudYali and AWS Config looks similar, and which is correct. CloudYali is currently focusing on resource inventory problem alone. That is the pain we faced during our operations and which prompted us to write this tool.\n\nI\u2019m myself is a cloud engineer and there were many situations where I/my team wanted to have a complete inventory of AWS Resources. Our environment is bit complex with multiple accounts and supporting (almost) all regions. Obviously we turned to AWS Config for solution, along with many open sources. Last year I wrote a [blog](https://heldsteel7.medium.com/aws-cloud-scanners-10024e4bb16f) on this quest to help engineers searching for such tools.\n\nThe problems we faced was multifold:**The coverage:** AWS Config being a native service one would expect it to cover (almost) all the AWS resources. Unfortunately, the reality is far from being that. The AWS Config coverage is far too less. Even for the AWS services that it supports, there are many resources which are not kept track of it by AWS Config. You can see from the AWS Config [page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html) that, even common AWS services like Route53 and more are not supported by AWS Config. In fact, support for AWS\u2019s oldest service SQS was added only in 2020.\n\nAt the moment, AWS Config in all [support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html) \\~102 AWS Resources, while Terraform [supports](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs) \\~630 AWS Resources , CloudFormation [supports](https://gist.github.com/0xdabbad00/b318f6b154cdee01a728844ba2f5a563) \\~ 330 AWS Resources. This translates the coverage to &lt; 30% when compared to CF and &lt; 20% when compared to Terraform. Often the complaint about CF is that it lags way behind Terraform. Considering that, the asset inventory forms the foundation for cost, security and management, this lack of coverage is somewhat discouraging.\n\nThe [AWS services](https://blog.cloudyali.io/aws-services-how-many-are-there-really) (list of all AWS services) are expanding at rapid speed and AWS Config is unable to keep up with the pace.\n\n**Usability:** AWS Config service is regional. This means you need to remember to enable AWS Config in each region for each account. To find any resources,across AWS accounts and regions, we need to configure aggregators and use that, which unnecessarily complicate the whole operations. Another use of AWS Config is to maintain the resource change history. This is achieved through recorders. This again requires specific configuration.\n\nHence we thought of writing a solution to address the inventory part of AWS Config to begin with. We want to have broad coverage of AWS Resources to ensure we provide a complete picture. Currently we have added [support](https://gist.github.com/cloudyali/d5e84c6e2db70a15026d9ed51334d7df) for **\\~ 250** AWS Cloud Resources. We plan to keep increasing this coverage in step by step manner.\n\nThe way CloudYali is designed, it works across multiple accounts and regions by default. User need not make any configuration changes. The same applies for the resource change history.\n\nThe Cloudyali UI shows all the configuration changes over a visual timeline, where a simple click on the timeline shows the changes present at that time. In yet another interesting feature, we maintain the lifetime of the AWS Resources as well. That means, even though the resources are removed from the cloud, it would still be possible to view those resources (which are marked as \u201cdead\u201d) and view their configuration change timeline as if it is a live/active resource.\n\nYou may take a look at 3 min demo of our product at : [https://youtu.be/j83DPTdbTPk](https://youtu.be/j83DPTdbTPk)\n\nIn yet another feature, which is under development right now, it would be possible to find resources with their properties (e.g. all EC2 instances with instance type t2.micro) through a simple intuitive search box. This functionality is available in AWS Config via SQL queries.\n\nIn short, **we want to make AWS Cloud discovery and querying/viewing for engineers a painless and intuitive operation**.\n\nWith your feedback we would certainly be able to achieve this goal. Please do visit our [website](https://www.cloudyali.io) and signup for a free preview access. If you have any further questions, I will be happy to answer! Thanks for your time!",

                                    "comment": "Okay I can see how that works, we recently just set-up config across \\~40 accounts and it took us awhile to write the terraform for it ( which wasn't easy ). I know companies that have tenant-based environments where new accounts are made daily that could use a product like yours. \n\nSince we already did the really hard work to setup config in all our accounts, and our main use case was around the base aws features ( ec2, s3, sns ) , I don't think the product would be a good fit for us.  \n\n\nSome insight I could give you, however; is that the person in our organization that had this pain point the MOST was our CISO ( Chief information Security Officer ). Most of the ground level cloud engineers are too busy making new stuff to focus on the macro-health and security of the entire environment.  It took our CISO pulling his hair out for months until we finally prioritized setting up config. So maybe lean more into cloudyali as a tool for cloud security, and think about how your marketing can speak to VP/C-Suite level employees that would be ultimately responsible for a system-wide architecture flaw.",

The first being a place for young introverts who need a safe and chill spot to share and interact. This website was created because I noticed that most social media sites just spam us with content and push us into busy environments. We try to get rid of that.The other half of this idea is growth, during quarantine we have all gotten very comfortable with not interacting with practically anyone. We strive to create an environment where we can all support each other but also push each other to get out of our comfort zones so we can all grow as people. I also hold weekly challenges called \"Comfort Zone Goals\" where users can post different social challenges for others to participate in. At the end of the week we come together and discuss how we did. It is a great way to explore opportunities outside your comfort zone while also having the support of other introverts.\n\nStage: Currently the startup is in a MVP stage\n\nRole: Since I am the only member I basically run everything\n\nGoals: Since I am only 17 I know I have little experience so this is a learning experience for me. I want to gain users and bring more awareness to my site as I think it can help a lot of people\n\nWhat I want from this subreddit: Exposure, I want to show my site to a larger audience so posting it here can help facilitate that\n\nDiscounts: As there is no product it is hard to give discounts but what I can say is that we do shoutouts on our social media account for users who complete our weekly challenges.",

            "comment": "Hey everybody - my startup is called [Revolut.io](https://Revolut.io) and my long-term goal is to get politics focused back on working people. I've started with data products, but once it has more capital, the plan is to create, and then spin-off, a worker-owned online platform for paid campaign work.\n\nURL: [https://revolut.io](https://revolut.io)\n\nLocation: Poughkeepsie, NY\n\nElevator Pitch: All politics is local, even as technology nationalizes our discourse. The people who work and contribute to get candidates elected can't be taken for granted, and we offer transformative AI-guided analytics that maps an area's donor types. If you're running in a district for the first time, or looking to target local political influencers, our data shows the groups of people that work together in that area to get candidates elected.\n\nOur target lists are custom-made for each client based on their individual appeals, and most recently were used by the Cal Cunningham campaign's record-breaking fundraising team. We also offer in-depth reports for helping plan out your strategy to win the support of your party and electoral victory, and will soon be rolling out our network of professional fundraisers, waiting to help your campaign reach critical mass.\n\nStage: **Validation.** The technology is great, and when campaign managers learn what it's all about, they seem to love it. We've had our first several clients, including the U.S. Senate race last year, which was hugely validating. The tech is matched with an understanding of politics (I worked in NY campaigns and gov for \\~10 years), and a careful adherence to state and federal regulations, which our competitors don't have (and has set this service apart with potential clients). Now the task is finding a way to grow. \n\nHow you all can help: I'm the founder and the sole person working on this. I think with some luck in finding people to help share the workload, or with connecting to capital, this thing is ready to take off. Not soliciting anyone individually, but general advice or contacts to institutional sources would be helpful. If you dig the idea and want to help, or have any advice, I'd love to hear from you.\n\nMore stuff to look at: \n\n* [The donor modeling sales page](https://revolut.io/donor-insights)\n* [A visualization of one of our models of New York County political groups](https://revolut.io/campfin/ny_pres_groups)\n* [Visualization of the 2020 primary candidates had among different donor groups in New York County](https://revolut.io/static/img/tsne%20group%20space.png)\n* [A slide deck for a social media tracking platform I created during COVID](https://revolut.io/static/data/revolut.io_social_media_tracker.pptx), that I'm still figuring out how to fit in with the elevator pitch.\n\nThanks for reading!",

The main advantage is it's low energy consumption, as it only needs energy when the content changes (much like an e-ink display). With it's distinct design we aim for high-class customers like hotels, restaurants, bars etc. The display is highly connected to show you upcoming weather information, the latest bitcoin price, messages from friends and much more.\n\nStage: Validation.\nWe developed RYNX from scratch and have all parts optimized for mass production already (PCB's, reluctance motors, etc.). We did some surveys and got a lot of valuable feedback from potential customers on how they would use the display. In the upcoming weeks we will start the live test with some of our pilot customers and present RYNX to the public.\n\nMore: Due to its high potential in saving energy our startup has been government-funded twice. Our founding team consists of three people: A hardware specialist, a software guy and a marketeer.\n\nLooking for: Feedback.",

I am wondering if I should pretend it's not just one person behind the project?  I am thinking that if I use \"we\" it gives more legitimacy to my product?  \n\n\nOn the other hand perhaps my story could entice some users as well?  Ex-teacher, learned some coding, built an edtech platform from scratch within a few months.\n\nInterested to hear people's views on this.",

That's an interesting question and it's great to see you're at this stage with your webapp. Both approaches you've mentioned have their merits, and it can depend on the culture and tone you're aiming to establish for your platform.  \nOn one hand, saying \"we\" can definitely lend a sense of scale and legitimacy. It implies there's a team working tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure the platform runs smoothly. This might build user confidence, especially if your target audience includes larger institutions or organizations that prefer dealing with established entities.  \nOn the other hand, your personal story is absolutely compelling. Many people admire the grit and determination it takes to learn a new skill, such as coding, and create something valuable from scratch. Sharing your journey might build a more personal connection with users and could foster a sense of community around your platform.  \nMy recommendation? A blend of both could work really well. You can use \"we\" when talking about the platform's development and maintenance, to give that impression of a team effort. And you can share your personal story on appropriate channels (like an 'About Us' page) to make that personal connection with users.  \nAlso, have a look at [Open Source CEO newsletter](https://open-source-ceo.beehiiv.com/). They share insights from various founders and their unique paths. You might find some inspiration there.  \nRemember, there's no absolute right or wrong way here. The tone and approach should reflect what feels authentic to you and what you believe will resonate with your users. Good luck!",

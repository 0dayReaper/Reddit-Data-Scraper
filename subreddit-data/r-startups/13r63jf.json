Your customer is the administrative staff not the physician.\n\nIts a fucking mess. You will need a full product built out before these guys even talk to you, if they talk to you. Clinical burden is well documented, you haven't stumbled on a problem no one knows.",

The hospital people will probably blow you off, but see if you can get a contact higher up in the chain of command that you could talk to.  Offer to have them test things out.  Ask them for other hospital chain contacts.  Then, talk to other hospital chains.  Doctor's offices have a lot of paperwork as well.\n\nMy first thought is that each hospital and doctor's office is going to have different paperwork and needs so it might be a longshot, but all startups are longshots initially.",

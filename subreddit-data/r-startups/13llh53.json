    "postText": "I have a technical cofounder that doesn't understand human interactions (cliche, I know). She recently escalated things to a nuclear level for not getting her way, despite there being a very real and clear solution to the problem that would mostly require talking, clarification, and some documentation. This nuclear option she has taken is best described by one word. Blackmail.\n\nThis nuclear response puts me in a hard position, since if I acquiesce, I will have given in to her explosive behaviour. My solution is to provide her with a clear route to the finish line and demand an apology. I think it will work, but this will probably not be the last time she does this.\n\nAside from this, she is mostly great to work with and progress is excellent. But her personality can be dogshit at times. What are some long-term strategies I can use to deal with such problems? Is it even something manageable? I know these are the #1 problems that kill companies, so I want to manage this properly.",

So you stop working together.\n\nBut, having said that, any chance of her going nuclear because you don't listen to her at an earlier stage?\n\nSo many non-technical founders go \"it's easy, you just do it\", and then give some example that is totally unrelated to anything. They're absolutely clueless about tech, and for some weird reason still think that they can somehow just say made up things to make them happen. And then they get angry at the techies for either disagreeing or not delivering.\n\nJust make sure that you aren't responsible for part of the problems before you part ways.",

I even acknowledged this when breaking the news. I am trying to do my job and need her cooperation to get to the finish line and provided clear instructions with what I need. \n\nThe problem I see here is that she doesn't understand that I have to deal with problems/questions that relate to her when it comes to dealing with investors. She doesn't interact with investors much, so to her this is all just out of thin air. But I have responsibilities and need to be diligent about certain things, and this annoys her.\n\nI am fine with her being angry with me even though I think it isn't warranted. I get it. I am not fine with blackmail.",

Some basic setup about how we've obviously clashed, and that I now want to try something new. So I'll have her explain to me what I should and shouldn't do to make her life easier. Like her giving me her ideal setup to make her happy doing her work.\n\nThen I'd consider each and every point where I could simply work around her. Where I don't try to make her fit into what I want (but perhaps don't technically require).\n\nAnd finally I would present her with the problems that I need solve and where her role traditionally should be part of the solution. So you're saying \"to make A happen I must get B from role C, which right now you have; in what other way do you suggest that I solve A/get B if I take that off your list of responsibilities?\".",

No one wants to work with (or follow the directions of) a jerk. \n\nYou are correct in that allowing it, you communicate that your boundaries can be pushed, so I would make this a very clear line in the sand. Don't let people push you around. Silencing your feelings to work with people you don't like is a very easy way to crash head first into burn out (especially as a co-founder you're working with all the time). \n\nBusinesses and startups are hard as is, and being in nuclear drama with your cofounder sounds like a lot of unnecessary stress and drama if she's not irreplaceable. Why would you want to work with someone who blackmailed you if you have an alternative path? That's not a valuable use of your time, because you'll probably just be walking on eggshells until it happens again. Don't wait for it to happen again, because it sounds like you already know it will. \n\nThose are just my opinions and may not fully take into consideration the nuances of the situation, so take it with a grain of salt. Best of luck!",

What you expressed were personal feelings. If you want sympathy you should ask for sympathy points from your mom.\n\nWhen you make some claim, then it is not to \"bore someone with details\" to provide evidence - frankly put, if your counterclaimant has any evidence to substantiate their claims, then this non-response won't hold up in court. That is my advice to you.\n\nOverall, as founders you're obligated to shareholders to distinguish personal emotion from operational and organizational strategy, and action on the latter. Conflating the two demonstrates your incapacity to lead.\n\nOn the contrary, you have relayed a vague self-victimizing, emotion-laden sob story and done nothing to illustrate your operational and organizational facts of the matter. Your childishness shown through your inability to grasp basic operational concepts demonstrates that you deserve no sympathy.\n\nIf you can't relay what happened with objectivity and fact, then you don't deserve objective and factual advice. Some of the commenters side with your sentiment, some don't - but that's a sentiment analysis.\n\nThere is no objective information you have relayed for anyone to be able to help you.\n\nHere are my feelings and personal thoughts on the matter: You're egotistical, incapable of leadership, and have poor communication skills. You're a diva, not a founder.",

Having an impartial third party could help facilitate a constructive conversation and resolve your differences amicably. It's important to acknowledge each other's strengths and work towards a mutual understanding, as a strong co-founder relationship can make or break a company!",

She interpreted what I wrote to her in an email in the worst possible way and decided to stop working effective immediately until I do as she says. The problem ended up being that we are from very different cultural backgrounds and she interpreted my questions as being outrageous, while for me, perfectly normal.\n\nIn the end, my problem was that I didnt call her on the phone to explain and instead wrote an email using my very American language. Her problem is that she strawmanned my email and over reacted without even calling me before ceasing all work. She ended up realizing she over reacted and apologized later. I apologized and explained that my questions were needed to help me fundraise and that I needed to know about particular details about her income. She found my questions to be too private in her cultural background.",

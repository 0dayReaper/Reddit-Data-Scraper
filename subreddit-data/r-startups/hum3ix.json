Extract 700k-1mm from the company as your salary every given year! If it's a tech startup even more than that 1.25-1.5mm is the appropriate salary and it has to be NET of taxes. If it's a tech startup in the Valley you can do 2-2.5mm net of taxes**",

Hell, doing such a thing may even be illegal if how you do this crosses the line into fraudulent territory.\n\nOP seems to have a real strong anti VC bias, which is fine in and of itself. But, how they are advising others to act on this bias is potentially dangerous.\n\nThink contextually. Act accordingly. Don't follow advice blindly. Vet it. Test it. Seek second and third opinions.\n\n**Update** OP has been banned for trolling and coming back to this submission to gloat about the \"success\" of their efforts here.",

I would say it's pretty standard these days for Series C and later - those are usually companies that have found product/market fit and are trying to grow and accelerate.  I know a number of founders that did it with series B, and I know some VCs who encourage it.  Basically if the valuations are good, the founder gets a few million, not enough to completely change their life or make them disinterested in the company, but enough to diversify their risk somewhat and not worry about having kids, etc.\n\nStructurally, for a percentage of the total VC investment, they sell some of their shares.  So for a theoretical $20m investment, a founder might take $2m, and the remaining $18m goes into the company.  And yes, the founder dilutes for both the created shares and the shares that are sold.",

Again, it's country-dependent but you get the idea: by having long-term goal, you preserve returns for a wider kind of shareholders.   \n\n\nThis is the big reason why big corps shareholders, when they recruit a CEO, now gives most of the salary in stock options: they want to force align the CEO with their short term interests 'cause the only fiduciary responsibility is not enough.   \n\n\n  \nI agree, though, that a lot of us, vastly ignore their responsibility and think they can do whatever they want.",

It's very clear for various administrative and operational duties but when it comes to fiduciary responsibility, it doesn't say it. \n\nThe thing is that in most countries, the law just states the fiduciary responsibility to shareholders without detail at all, and until the 80's the assumption was that when it says responsibility to shareholders, it means long term preservation of the company. We then more and more switched from industrial shareholders to financials one and given how you interpret the law, you could well totally sacrifice a company and kill it in 10 years but with a high return for shareholders, or go for a long term strategy that will pay off too but will not kill the company. And in most juridictions, it's unclear what you can or must do if the biggest shareholders wants a short-term thing. \nWe mostly ducktaped that problem by enforcing rules on how you become a shareholders (tender offers became more .... morale?) but there is no guidebook on how to deal with the situation when you already have a conflict of interest among your shareholders. Some court could totally rule in a way that the interest of the most long-termist shareholder is preserved.",

Also you as the founder should think in bets too (Annie Duke's book Thinking in Bets is a fantastic resource on this subject). If you're going the VC route, why should you take on the risk and stress of VC money without considering at least $100MM in ARR? Otherwise, bootstrap it. (It may be worth bootstrapping anyways, but that's for another conversation).\n2. **You only have this horse to ride, there are no alternative bets, you are essentially monodimensional and non-diversified.** If an idea fails within 2 years and you plan to do this over the next 30 years, that's at least 15 opportunities. If you know when to kill a project sooner, you'll get more shots on goal.\n3. **Never give in to a VC and change your risk profile because they ask you to do so.** Your vision size has nothing to do with your risk profile. For example, you can consider creating multiple SaaS tools to serve the same or adjacent markets. Your risk is relatively small when targeting the same customer segment and problem.",

But what salary is appropriate? For a 10 million investment, do you expect a \"hungry\" founder to only take low wage of 40-60K ? Or something \"market appropriate\" of 70-120K depending? Or is 200-300K even considered acceptable?\n\nI think considering the very low chance of taking a 1-10mil investment and turning into a 10-100-500mil company, the more I've thought about this path I wonder how many people genuinely think this is a good deal from the founders side. Seems like a bit of a fool's errand for many people. Especially if the pay is under-market until you \"strike gold\"\n\nMight as well just play in the stock market if you're just trying to get rich and take a huge gamble. \n\nLike you said it's not for everyone and I'm definitely wanting to get into the game as a small very slow growing business owner with little to no funding.

For example, if your market rate is 12K/month, you can choose to be paid 6K/month and receive vesting options representing 300,000 common stock (or 3% of our 10m initial common stock). We've specified a minimum/maximum band to ensure that all early team receive some stock, and some cash for work.\n\nedit: To clarify, this is a % that's chosen at hire, and it's fixed once agreed on due to the difficulties of reallocating options and the incentive conflicts with allowing people to change their risk profile once the reward is known.

So if you're not doing everything to grow, a 5x valuation boost (5m to 25m) over 5 years is not a great investment. Because it was high risk, moderate reward (over the stock market).\n\nYou extract the value when the company sells. Take a living salary. If you want to earn $700k per year, bootstrap and grow the company with a small, talented staff. Pay them all really well and pay yourself the dividend. Don't pay yourself $700k out of the investors money. And founders do get to diversify. At year 3-4 you'll probably do a Series B/C where you can take some money off the table to secure yourself a little. But use that money to secure yourself. I've seen a few founders take money off the table and buy a big house with the cars etc and they get bored with the work. A acquisition quickly follows.",

The point is to grow your business with it, which means sometimes taking bets with it.  They should be very educated and informed bets, but bets nonetheless.  You don't put that cash into your money market account and hope to get 0.5% back on it in a year.  You spend it.\n\nA \"bet\" is not just \"think big\".  A bet is relying on your current LTV or churn numbers when calculating CAC, assuming they will stay the same if you spend more $.  A bet is hiring a few new salespeople based on the numbers your current team puts up with an understanding that they'll break even in a year or so.  A bet would be that you've fundamentally found product/market fit and just need to get the word out there about your product. Etc etc..\n\nIf you do not want to take those bets, do not accept VC money.  If your vision for the company doesn't line up with the VCs you're talking to, don't take their money.  If you think that your company is growing very safely and there's minimal risk but you need some acceleration today - take out a bank loan or revenue-based funding instead of VC.",

However, we can safely highlight a few facts about the VC side first. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. On the VC side, they have their stakeholders and investors too. These people generally qualify to invest with private bankers and hence able to get better deals than the average retail investor.\n2. As such, the venture capital fund that the VC manages has to provide better returns than what they can get from the market or bankers.\n3. To get higher returns, the risk is higher. How many people will invest in Yahoo, Amazon back in the 90s? Or for that matter, Microsoft and Apple when it all started?\n4. So, the first question from the VC side, will definitely be \"Why would I invest if my potential returns are only marginally better than what I can get from the banks?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the OP, I am trying hard to understand why the thread started with a view that the VC 'forces' you to think in a certain way?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you are raising funds from the VCs, you present a certain vision, milestones and financial projections to them. Think again, most of the time, it is the founders or business owners who are approaching the VCs. So, you are in control of the narrative about how big or how small the vision is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, the VC has to very quickly assess if your company fits into their investment themes (are they running an AI-only fund, a fund for B2C in a specific region, a med-tech fund etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, if it gets past this round, it will most likely mean that what you have highlighted interests them. It could be the problem that you are solving or the way that you are solving an existing issue. It could also be that you have a B-grade idea (not suggesting that you do but to highlight that VC invest for a variety of reasons), but they see something unique in your team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom there, if all the discussions still do not fall off the cliffs, a term sheet is offered. And if you do accept it, money gets wired over. Now, here's the part that the VC will be at their wit's end as well. The money is now with you. And you are the subject matter expert. Their hardest work is the due diligence that they have done before giving you the money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf there's anything that they want you to work towards, it is a dialogue between them (stakeholders) and you or your team as well. You are the subject matter expert for the business. They provide third-party feedback as advisors or Board Members giving you fewer bias insights. There is always room for discussion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy opinion is,  the VC is not interested in running your business. Their expertise is on investment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt what point do you lose the narrative or control? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want a conservative growth, should you even consider raising funds from the VCs? Or will a business loan from the bank be more appropriate? Or is bootstrapping the way to go?",

            "comment": "Three thoughts come to mind:\n\n1. Taking money from Angels or VCs is like getting married. You better be aligned and share the vision for the company and values. If you don't, you're going to run into trouble. An investor you're aligned with will not push you to do things that are bad for you or your business. Hopefully, your investor can also bring experience to the table, in addition to money. In those cases, if they are suggesting a different approach maybe that's because it comes from experience and you should strongly consider it.\n2. If you want to run a lifestyle business (i.e. a business that is just big enough to provide for you a nice living, but isn't going to scale), you're not investable and you should not get investment. The minute you take VC cash, you're committing to scaling your business in some reasonable time-frame (5-7 years) which is risky. If that's not the case, don't take VC money.\n3. There is no universe where an Angel or VC will let you extract $1mil/year to 2.5mil/year (!!!) from the investment they gave you. They invested in you to grow the business, not to grow bank account. Maybe you're talking about getting huge institutional money on the order of $100mil+ where you can hide a salary of $1mill/year, but that is not normal. Your first two or three rounds will be under $10million or less (and your first round will probably be an Angel round under $1mill) and you taking a significant chunk of that for YOUR salary is not going fly.",

(Not to mention they are people who engage with their portfolio companies).\n\nIf you've pitched multiple VCs and are consistently hearing the same thing you need to face reality. Either:\n\n1) You need to improve your messaging around your vision\n\n2) You are being too conservative and need to be more aggressive\n\n3) You don't fit the VC profile and need to look elsewhere to acquire capital for growth.\n\nLet's say it is #3. Where else should you look?\n\nLet's try (in no particular order):\n- Bootstrap it: If you have the money why aren't you funding it?\n- Revenue: The best source of growth capital\n- Angels: Smaller investors who write $5k - $100k checks; they have different motives than VC\n- Debt Financing (may have warrants): Cheaper than equity but has own downsides\n- Many other sources: Get creative. Welcome to startups.\n\nA few final thoughts:\n- VCs aren't trying to pit you directly against FAANG (generally) since they hate losing money and that's a losing proposition.\n- If you're early stage (or even mid-stage) those salary numbers are hilarious. That's several engineers, marketing, sales, bus ops, etc that could be driving your growth. No one reasonable expects you to eat dog food but as a founder/executive your responsibility is to grow the company and shareholder value; your shares are where you get wild returns. You want a high salary? Grow or bootstrap.\n- If you don't need VC, don't take it. It changes the game in many ways both good and bad.\n\nSource: Experience on both sides of the table. Ran an Accelerator and handled investments, previously launched companies and funded in a variety of ways contingent on what my personal goals were for the company (High growth with big market? VC. Lifestyle or more moderate size? Other.)",

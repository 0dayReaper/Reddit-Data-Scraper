Why did you think they had no shot? \n\nFor me, I thought Clubhouse was a flash in the pan and it appears that it might be, but the jury is still out. I wonder about the long-term success of this company. Maybe they can successfully pivot to keep the money coming in. \n\nSo r/startups, what idea or company surprised you? I'd love to hear from you.",

The fact that they can find a niche market to start is a miracle. Now it's a total perception shift on how vacation lodging can happen, and effects real estate everywhere. \n\nIf they can bootstrap Airbnb through craigslist rental listings, you can do anything.",

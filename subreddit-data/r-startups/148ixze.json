    "postText": "I have had an idea for a product for about 5 years now and every few months I will come back to trying to figure out how to take the next steps and I keep running into an issue of finding a technical designer to work with me on this. The product would be a padded piece of sports equipment that needs to fit very closely to the users body. The fit is extremely important. \n\nWhen I google things like \"sports equipment designer, padded sports equipment designer, technical garment design firm,\" I never really find the person I am looking for. I've looked on fiver, I've tried searching on linkedin, I've done endless google searches and haven't found the person I am looking for. I can find garment designers that specialize in fashion, I have never found anyone who specializes in garment or equipment design for sports. Whenever I include sports in those search terms I find jersey designers which is not what I am looking for. This would be much closer to a pair of knee pads than a shirt or jersey. \n\nIn a perfect world I'd pay a company or individual $5,000 or so to design this piece of sports equipment for me and create a tech pack so I can then search out a manufacturer to get it stiched and assembled. Finding that person has been impossible. Does anyone have any recommendations of who I should be looking for? The idea I have is pretty fleshed out, I've done testing on very crude prototypes and have a very good idea of what I want I just can't find the technical person to get me to the next step. ",

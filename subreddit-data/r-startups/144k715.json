    "postText": "i want to open a small bubble tea store and sorry i have a crazy dumb question. maybe it's because i'm too scared of risks but when people say startups fail (especially in food industry), do they mean an actual negative figure or just earning very small profit? im willing to accept very low profit in the first few months and eventually work my way up, but i don't think i can handle an actual loss. what are your takes/advice on this? thanks so much in advance.",

And it\u2019s got a lot of advantages.  It\u2019s grab and go, mostly, you don\u2019t need a big footprint.\n\nTea is cheap.  It\u2019s mostly water.  Water is cheap.  \n\nAnd it\u2019s really simple, any idiot can be taught to do it.  \n\nHow do you make money?\n\nLocation.  Location.  Location.",

In my industry, it can take between six and nine months or longer.\r  \n\r  \nConsequently, when working with people new-to-the-industry, I suggest they have six to nine months of working capital to cover operating expenses in addition to the other start-up expenses.",

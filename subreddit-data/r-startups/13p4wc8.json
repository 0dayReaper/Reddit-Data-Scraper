I don\u2019t know how to get genuine market feedback without coming across like I am just trying to \u2018sell\u2019. \n\nAt this stage I really just need eyes, suggestions, concerns etc, rather than the sales - but every time I post I feel guilty or \u2018spammy\u2019\n\nIs there anything you have tried that works well, without costing a fortune?",

Replay them and gather your feedback without having to bug your users. It's a good method for improving your ux and identifying features that add no value, identifying bugs, etc. \n\nRegarding the problem domain or solution, you could find user groups or conferences where your target customer attends and put in some leg work. Go share your vision and passion with some domain experts. See what you learn.",

While both require of you to formulate a hypothesis you are trying to test and get feedback on the latter also requires of you to be able to formulate questions that helps you support or refute your hypothesis while getting genuine feedback.   \n\n\nA good starter book on how to formulate questions that don't suck is \"The mom test\". I've also recently written on my substack about how to test business and product ideas using different tools.   \n\n\nFor you specifically, just because you seem to be blocking yourself from moving forward, I would also recommend focusing on what you mean by \"spammy\" and what do you think would happen if you were \"spammy\"?",

In the past, I've always done very serious \"solves a real problem\" kind of businesses but now I'm trying to do more ridiculous things like Undeath Coverage - the world's first insurance policy that will cover you in the event that you return from the dead! This is such a big departure that none of my contacts are really helpful with the marketing aspects and I fee like I am starting from scratch...\n\nI posted a few times on here when I felt it was appropriate and not spammy, and I got some good feedback. For example, I somehow missed that you can't see the price of the policy until you've logged in and are in the middle of buying. Talk about a big miss.\n\nI've also talked to a couple people last week and offered them a 100% off coupon in return for them going through the site and the purchase process on a WebEx rather than by themselves. That way I can see how they navigate, listening to their questions and concerns along the way.\n\nEssentially since I get significantly less feedback than usual when starting a new project, I am trying to make the most out of what I do get.",

They are in the leadership meetings. They were there when we had 5 people and now we have 60. They make decisions over 100s of thousands of dollars (soon millions). Their salaries have shot up too with the companies success. I don\u2019t think they spend their time on Reddit, so you aren\u2019t hearing from them here. As the CEO I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here either, just can\u2019t sleep and my brain doesn\u2019t stop!",

Ie if you are stuck in a legacy industry and want to switch to tech. \nIt's pretty muchh what I did. I was working as a mech eng in a very non tech consumer goods (think furniture) company. I joined a growing Series B tech HW company. \n\nWith this I got a salary better than the one I was on, plus half decent options. \n\nSurvivor bias here, as they actually ended up doing pretty well and getting bought by a large company. Options ended up being worth a couple hundred grand. \n\nRegardless, I now have plenty of options in tech (including potentially product), and have more money / salary than I ever would have had if I'd stayed in the old industry.",

One major benefit of pre-seed startups is also that the 409A valuation is extremely low, so everyone can easily do a 83(b) election and retain their equity permanently, even if they later leave the company.

I've oscillated back and forth between both, really it depends what you're looking for:\n\n\\- For the most part, a bigger company will be better for most employees. Higher wages, more stability, less stress. \n\n\\- But if you want the potential to have impact on your work (e.g. working on products more directly influencing the future of the company), obviously you need to find something smaller. \n\n\\- Equity upside can be pretty much discounted, the odds are extremely low. If I was interested in equity upside, I would be a Co-Founder, not an early employee. \n\n\\- That being said, a growth-stage startup (think: FB at under 200 employees) is an amazing win. But to find these, you pretty much have to be as insightful as a professional venture capitalist, and even most of them suck or just get lucky. \n\n\\- Obviously don't be dumb and slash your pay in half to get 0.1% equity at some trendy startup where you just met the founders last weekend, if you have a family to support. Etc. \n\n\\- But if you're early 20s fresh out of a CS program and have the chance to work at, for example, a YC-backed startup under 10 people that just raised 1.5M? Totally try it out.\n\nKnow thyself, and choose accordingly!",

            "comment": "A fairly common scenario I've witnessed is where an early employee might have 5% given them when they join (with vesting or whatnot). Then 2 years later the company sells for 10 million. \n\nOn the surface this should be about 500k. Yet, somehow, between dilution, weird rules for the new vesting, and 20 other complications they end up with 80k before taxes. \n\nBut somehow the two founders who each had 20% end up with 3.5 million each between \"retention bonuses\" and other crap. Plus, in the end stage of the deal they started handing out \"presidents issue shares\" like they were candy. Their wives get 10% each. The lawyer even somehow ended up getting 5%. \n\nI've known a few people who were early stage employees who did well by their shares but without exception they played serious hardball on how those were issued. A common practice where these early stage people who were critical did very well were getting \"undilutable\" shares. These things are solid gold, because when a serious investor comes along they will shit their pants and call the founders fools. Then one day the founders hand a contract for the developer to sign because they are \"simplifying our cap table\" this contract exchanges their solid gold shares for shit shares. At this point it becomes a negotiation a very serious negotiation. One where they quickly bend over and get completely screwed by the developer because if they don't agree, the serious finance person will walk. Let's just say these negotiations get fairly emotional.\n\nOne interesting contract I saw between two founders was that the technical founder received any benefit the other did. The term benefit was fairly broad so as to include pretty much any money the company spent. So, when the business guy went to a conference and stayed at a nice hotel, this immediately triggered the other founder going to a conference and staying at a nice hotel. The business guy was endlessly trying to explain that his expenses were needed an the tech guy's weren't. This relationship ended in when the shotgun clause was activated with the business guy losing hard.",

If you are working as a founding engineer or any other role without actually having started the company, you are probably putting the same effort-hours than ceo, cto etc. But getting 10x less equity and way less salary than an equivalent position in a &gt; series B or even big tech. I\u2019d say either start your own company or work for a large company. Working for seed is great to learn but benefits are shit.",

I think the benefits are you get some great work experience out of it (or at least a great story to say in interviews) and then you can move onto your next thing.

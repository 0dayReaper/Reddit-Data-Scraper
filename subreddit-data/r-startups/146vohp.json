    "postText": "A common piece of advice for founders starting out is that they should focus on a very niche market(for example Amazon focused on books). But, is this still the case for products with inherent product risk? For example, this piece of advice wouldn\u2019t apply to video game companies, openai, etc, right? If so, why?",

            "comment": "Going niche is going to allow you to get traction quicker because your product is defined for a specific demographic and you can laser target on acquiring them and modeling the product to their needs. \n\n You could attempt a category-killer play, however, being all things to all people is usually not the recipe for success, and certainly not quickly. \n\nIn regards to your inherent risk statement. \n\nVideo games are incredibly niche. \n\nOpenAI, while not niche in usage, is niche in business model when you consider the API use-case will differ for each client. They in fact, serve the niche companies. Though I'll agree, definitely more generic than niche as a business model. Similar to Twilio. \n\nNow, there's a secondary part to your question as well \"How niche are you talking?\", because going one step down is different than 3 steps down into a sub-niche of a sub-niche. \n\nFinancial companies are doing this a lot. \n\nBank &gt;&gt; Regional Bank &gt;&gt; Regional Bank For Teachers\n\nIt's a way of differentiating what is typically a core product with almost identical feature sets, however, it's framed as a solution for X person, not everyone. \n\nHealthcare is another great example of niching down. There are conditions, geos, patients, physicians, online/offline, the list goes on. \n\nHowever, as a marketer not a founder, my views may be different. I deal in promoting products so I have a macro view of traction from that level. Niche-targeting works better than generic in every single case except giving away free money. So, my advice would be to look at current traction and the demographic of current customers, especially those that are repeat buyers, and see if there's a niche overlap or specific use case that's predominant. \n\nThere are truly so many variables in determining how niche you need to go, or if you need to go, and customers are going to be the barometer.",

            "comment": "A good niche is a market that you can make very happy, communicates among themselves and you can defend it from others that come to compete with you.   But also not so small or unique that there is nowhere to grow practically once you have it and not enough revenue to build a meaningful and sustainable business.\n\nI once built a business that the customers absolutely loved and we crushed the incumbent competitors, but there wasn\u2019t any adjacent market to take the technology afterwards using the limited revenue we were able to generate.   If we had more revenue we could have afforded to market and penetrate another non-adjacent market, but doing this is very expensive and distracting.   We had enough market to get profitable, but not enough to invest to take the company into a new market and reach the next level of scale.",

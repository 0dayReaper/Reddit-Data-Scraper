    "postText": "Just launched an MVP, all services are free. I havent built the paid service yet because I want to validate the idea first.  Got a few signup but the retention is very low. I tried to talk to the users by asking for feedback via multiple emails and puting a form in the landing page. But so far received 0 response. How can i know whether my business idea is validated? I run a low budget google ad campaign but none of the users replied to my email. I have some Google Analytics data, the engagement rate and CTR looks high (ads CTR is &gt;6% and engagement is &gt;50%)  which makes it more confusing.\n\nShould I iterate the MVP to get more users until someone repond with some feedback to finally validate? Is there any way to find users that are willing to talk? Or accept the harsh truth that my idea is actually already invalidated?",

Bad products can run good ads. Good products can run bad ads. There\u2019s no correlation there. I would just look at your conversion rate and retention. \n\nI\u2019d likely suggest a pivot in this case.",

The DAU/MAU 0.6% and DAU/WAU is 10%. So it seems like most users got what they need after the first visit and seldom come back. These are all data from the last month.\n\nThanks for your advice. I think the question now becomes, how to identify the right pivot direction.",

You validate first, then do a cruddy prototype for feedback, then build mvp. \n\nStop building. Stop looking at sign ups. \n\nIf you are b2c, go into Reddit and discord to find groups in your industry. Go and interview 200-300 min. 3 times each. That is low btw, most sv startups do much more. If b2b Reddit and LinkedIn.\n\nDon\u2019t mention your product, you only are doing research into the industry. First set is to establish that this is a customer segment. Then problem discovery. Then product validation. When doing this process if you have done it right you will have built your first user base. You skipped this step which is why no one is using your product. It\u2019s fixable no stress but be mentally prepared to have to rebuild all you did. This is why you have to validate first, cause changing code is a royal pain.",

Tracking dau/mau this early is not very helpful when you have a handful of users, especially if they aren't returning.\n\nYour email may have bad conversion either because the content is bad or what you're offering people isn't worth their attention/time. It's also likely you're targeting the wrong people. Early products usually offer something to users in return for their time. I recently noticed a SaaS product offering $200 amazon gift card for a 30 min call. What was your offer to users when you mailed them? Refine it.\n\nThat said, emails usually are not very personal as a channel. When you're starting you really want to come across as someone that truly cares about the problem someone has. Even better if you care about the someone directly and demonstrate this when you reach out. Ruthlessly narrow down the focus of who you're building for and try to build empathy for them. Most people when they see a founder who truly cares about them are willing to help. I reached out to people on Instagram and they were pretty responsive.\n\nAs others suggest, you shouldn't pivot just because your initial reception is bad. You need conviction. If you have that, stick to the problem space and talk to enough people and you'll eventually land on something. It's important to have patience.",

Another form, which you might be experiencing, is do people even care about it to try it, how frequently do they use it and do they recommend it. Seems to me that both validations are in favor of your business idea not being of value to your users. But this could also mean that you are not targeting the right people or that your value proposition is off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The ads CTR is &gt;6% and the conversion rate is is \\~3%\n\nThese metrics don't mean much. 3% could mean that only 3 people converted or it could mean that thousands have converted. I have a feeling, which I can't verify, that you are running very broad targeting which additionally invalidates these metrics. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The DAU/MAU 0.6% and DAU/WAU is 10%\n\nThis paints a better picture and I agree with your conclusion that it seems your business idea is a one-off use. People use it sometimes and then don't need to use it for a long time. This could again be that your value proposition is off, that the product is too difficult to use, or that it truly is just a one off that people don't need to repeatedly use. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDepending on what your product is I think it's time to pivot or scrap.",

Actually in this MVP signing up provides no additional feature except for basic bookmarking and keeping the email. So users can enjoy all features without signing up at all. And from the analytics data shows that the engagement time is high so users did read my content.",

This means a much bigger push for beta user acquisition is required, and there are a number of ways of doing that to achieve higher levels of users. \n\nA good first milestone for validation is 100. Then 500 for second stage validation then 1k for final validation stage (if final is required). \n\nI would also be keen to understand what other data you might have on hand regarding user behaviour. This could really inform next steps.",

            "comment": "I have been conducting Market Research for over 20 years and believe you have to start with the basics of foundational research and build/optimize along the way.  You need to start with 2-3 Focus Groups of your key target (can be virtual) to hear from them directly what's working and what needs improvement. It may not be your current users, but you can have them use the MVP as pre-work before coming to the group.  Asking the right questions to the right audience in the right sequence is key.  Below is a High Level Approach to optimizing a product or service - you will also pick up some language cues to use in the marketing down the road: \r  \n\r  \n\\- Flesh out the idea using Focus Groups of the intended user (qualitative research) - create a discussion guide that will determine a few underlying questions like 1- what need does the idea solve, 2- would they use it as is or make any adjustments, 3- who is this for, 4-what would they pay for such a product or service. 6-8 respondents per group\r  \n\r  \n\\- Make adjustments, then test 2-3 versions in a Concept Test (quantitative research) to see which one performs the best. I would include an actual ranking question in the survey as well as open-end questions around likes, dislikes, improvements, potential use cases - this will help with marketing the idea on the backend by using the 'consumers language' of how they talk about the product or service. At least n-100 online survey completes of your key consumer which will need to be determined early on.\r  \n\r  \n\\- ideally one idea will outperform the others and you can move forward with that one into an actual Usage Test to make sure it actually delivers on the idea (quantitative research) and have validated data for support.\r  \n\r  \nOnce you analyze the data from these pieces of primary research, then you will have validated number to back your idea and can move forward more confidently on marketing and selling it...",

At the moment what I can tell with some degree of certainty is that you might have validated if your potential customers see value or a need in answering your emails and you need to find a different way to either incentivize them or get answers from them.",

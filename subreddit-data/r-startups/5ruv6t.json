    "postText": "I stopped calling myself a startup and started calling myself a small business. This may seem insignificant but it definitely released the pressure and allowed me to focus on small business things and not small startup things. Instead of calling or trying to connect with investors I started calling potential clients. Instead of researching incubator firms to give me a crash course in startup stuff I started calling organizations to be a vendor and set up sales booths at their events. Instead of working desperately hard to fill my office with cool toys and employees I can't afford I just set up a office in the basement and work by myself. The idea hasn't changed, my product is still the same, and my goal is still the same. But by acting like a small business and not a cool startup I was able to focus. I now have 5-7 clients for the summer months. I still have a long way to go before I can call myself a success. But letting go of the fad startup label I was actually able to get started. J.M. Daniel  DroneVideoJunkie.com\n\nEdit: After seeing how people responded to this post it makes me wonder if other people experienced the same issues. Also, people think my website sucks lol. I'll take that criticism. Wix isn't the best but it's enough to get me off the ground (as a small business), find paying clients, and reinvest revenue into a better site when I have the budget.  ",

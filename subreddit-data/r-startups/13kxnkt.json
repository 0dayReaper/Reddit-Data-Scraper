    "postText": "Hi, we've got a IoT startup with a hardware element.\n\nTLDR:\n\nLooking for advice regarding angels, VC, funds, and hardware/IoT communities in the US to engage with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBody:\n\nWe have broad patent protection, several prototypes, and a preorder signup CAC via paid social between $0.80 and $2.10. Our preorder signup list is 550+. We have a signed LOI from a major UK retailer.\n\nWe're entering a $4.5B+ market which has grown at a 53% CAGR in the past 10 years and has grown 20-25% YOY for the past two.\n\nWe're based in the UK but both founders have US citizenship. Two weeks ago we got access to UK's most comprehensive data aggregator for funding rounds, and the information was staggeringly bad. In the past 15 months there were 11 pre/seed consumer electronics deals in the UK with a median round size of \u00a3122k. \n\n***EDIT:*** *I just got access to a more granular look into UK investments. There does not appear to have been a single consumer electronics company that had a pre/seed round within the last year in the UK. I am looking back further now. There has been one B2B pre/seed electronics company with a total market valuation of GBP130k.*\n\nBecause of this we've now started looking for investments and engagement in the US. We're looking to raise our first round. The raise is entirely to accelerate development and pay for full-time hands.\n\nWe met someone from a US preseed VC that told us they wouldn't consider startups with fewer than 25,000+ preorder signups. Is this actually expected or was she just brushing us off? I struggle to see how a pre-investment startup could afford to invest the marketing to build a preorder list of that size.\n\nWould strongly appreciate any insight as to angels, investment networks, VCs, funds, and hardware/IoT communities based in the US that you could advise us to connect and reach out to.",

            "comment": "Raising right now is not good.  At our itty bitty angel group, the decision was made to concentrate on existing investment companies and to not spend a lot of time concentrating on new investments.  This is due to interest rates.  Quite simply, a 5-6% tbill is a better investment today than a speculative company investment where my money is years away from coming back and stands a better chance of not coming back at all.  Now, none of this helps you, just sets the stage of what you people are already telling you.\n\nMy suggestion is for one founder to be located in the US.  Everyone else can be anywhere else they want to be, but the person raising better be near where the investors are.  They don\u2019t need to live in the same zip code, but it is the responsibility of the founders to go to the investors.\n\nI don\u2019t know what preorder signups mean, is that customers, devices, or something else.  I\u2019d do my best to turn that into orders and ultimately money.  Is anyone willing to sign a non binding letter of intent?  These have to be in simple numbers that someone can easily understand.\n\nGood luck!",

I am working now on fitting the works-like into the form-factor the looks-like. \n\nI want to get that done before actually selling them so that I am selling 100% what the customer will be getting. We have been approached by UK's version of shark tank - but again, I don't want to appear on that until we get the fit into the form-factor. And currently since we can't pay anyone due to being pre-raise we only have one set of hands working to that.\n\nWe do have a signed LOI with a major UK retailer. We actually didn't pursue this and they approached us. We can try to leverage that to secure more LOIs.",

We only just recently discovered how little pre/seed investment there has been in consumer electronics in the UK. As stated in OP, in 15 months there were 11 deals, with a median round size of GBP122k.\n\nWe're starting to look in the US and have sent out a lot of cold outreach via Linkedin. But frankly, I think for every hundred cold outreaches I send, my messages get one view. \n\nThanks for the suggestions! \n\nPitchbook costs $20,000 per year, which as a pre-raise startup we simply can't afford. \n\nI don't know what is mHub and can't find anything other than a company in Malaysia. Do you have a link for mHub please? \n\nWe've applied to HAX but they stated they do not fund B2C hardware. We've applied to Techstars and Y-comb, fingers crossed on those.",

Some investors would prefer investing in software companies.  Have you looked for anyone offering grants.  Like the National Science Foundation.  Where have you been looking.  What cities.  1) San Jose to San Francisco, New York City, Boston,...  2) Miami, Austin,...  Have you considered crowdfunding, SPACs, friends &amp; family.  Have you considered that the Baby Boomers (a lot of societies are aging, not just the US.  Have you considered that the Baby Boomers have or are entering retirement and are getting more conservative in their investments.  That we're facing a recession in the US.  Banks are tightening their standards.  I imagine funds are having more trouble raising money from limited partners.)  What are you doing to show investors you'll be good stewards of their money.  Show that you can do more with less.  Where are your customers.  Why are you in the UK.  Why should a VC invest in you at a time when he/she is worried about the companies in his/her portfolio.  Deciding which companies to keep funding through the bad times.  And which companies to throw under the bus.  How great is your story.   Scotland business classes at his castle man, says if you get 1 investor in a 100 to give you money, you're doing good.  So don't give up easily.

When searching for investors, make sure to research and target those who have successfully invested in hardware/IoT startups before, as they'll understand the challenges and growth potential better. Networking events and startup groups are also great places to find relevant connections. Best of luck!",

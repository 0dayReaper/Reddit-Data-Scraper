I\u2019ve walked into these stories, \u201coh we just need another feature and we\u2019ll be good to go.\u201d  No, no you won\u2019t.  The truth is that things are broken has been my experience.\n\nWhen you swap horses midstream, you are saying that your current plan isn\u2019t working and your code is a problem.  I get hired to come in to build and support a code base.  My experience is that taking over someone else\u2019s codebase is a disaster because their codebase is a disaster.  You can\u2019t have a solid foundation on crap.\n\nUnless you would commit to a 100% rewrite, I wouldn\u2019t touch it with a ten foot pole.\n\nPs.  I say this from experience.",

Also 'insulation' if that's not too crazy. And then as a stretch goal we'd like to aim for 'gas and electric' lines! We can't pay you but we're happy to offer you 5% equity!\"",

When creating a startup it is usually much more important to build a strong backend product and wrap it rapidly in a slapdash UI to validate an idea.\n\nThe overconfidence in your post about your progress shows that you don\u2019t understand/undervalue what I would consider to be the much harder and more important part of the development.\n\nAll of this combined gives the same energy as non technical people texting their technical friends \u201cdude, I have an app idea that will change the world, can you build it? I\u2019ll give you 10% of the company if you do!\u201d\n\nTherefor RIP OP because the overconfidence and lack of awareness will likely lead to a failed product as you need a much more experienced developer to do the system design who won\u2019t tolerate that.

            "comment": "I went with a freelancer, and I feel great about it.\n\nPart of my reasoning is that I think my beta period may be long, and idk if I'll have enough work for a full-timer to do. Plus, I know enough to change font colors and maybe add a new page, or whatever, which may be enough for a while.\n\nAnother consideration is that good full-stack developers are rare. You can't just plan to hire one person to do your front end and backend. I hired a front end developer, I'm writing the code for the API, and I also have a devops guy who does odds and ends.\n\nIt's not the fastest thing in the world, because they have a fulltime job outside of my project. But I've been really happy with the results.\n\nHowever, I may have gotten lucky. In the past, I've struggled to find competent developers who want a non-full-time job. People who are too flaky or combative for a full-time job are over-represented in the market.\n\nDepending on the kind of work you're doing, you might want to hire a student. There are a lot of talented kids for whom a part-time gig fits well into their needs and lifestyle. Just be prepared to teach them stuff like \"If I send you an email, please email me back in a couple days, so I know you read it. Don't just do the work I assigned you.\" And, frankly, idk if I'd give them anything super complex to do.\n\nChatGPT is also a huge help. I had it do some intermediate-level js tasks. And I even wrestled it into doing some objective-c -- which meant that I didn't have to hire a whole new person! But that was quite a slog. I wouldn't give a full-throated recommendation for that.",

            "comment": "What I like to do, which has served me well on all projects, is aggressively document and communicate with myself and future developers (including future me) via GitHub issues. I create GitHub projects and milestones along with additional labels. I break out issues into several smaller tasks (as issues) and then close everything as I fix them. And for things that I can't address, I assigned to the label \"help-wanted.\" After documenting precisely what I need, I ultimately move these help-wanted labeled issues into a \u201cGet Help\u201d Milestone. I then continue moving through everything that I can do myself. BTW - I also have an \u201ceasy\u201d label for when I have a few minutes to jump into the code. I often filter by that label. It\u2019s an excellent psychological boost to close out issues, even small ones. \n\n\n\nOnce it is time to hire people, I can sort by these labels and milestones and see what kind of commitment I need to make. Often, I am not a front-end person; I can visually see that I need a lot of front-end help, which would mean someone more full-time, while individual issues with the backend or in the DevOps space suggest I could hire a freelancer for those tasks.  If you can do something like this plan, the question you\u2019re asking will answer themselves. Also, you can tell where you need a rock star developer or just cheap tasked-based hire. Also, you could end up with a large team over a short period of time, if you have many different tasks, in many different categories or part of the code base. \n\n\n\nThe other benefit of this methodology is that when it comes time to manage a team, including a team of two, you have very clear milestones and tasks that an individual needs to do. I always insist that people do each job as a pull request and we review each other's code. This allows me to learn and stay on top of my projects. More often than not, you can get in a desperate situation where you need to bring someone in, relax and let them get back to you in a month, and you have no idea what the heck is happening with your project, whether it's worked out well or not. Many, especially in the YC community, advised technical cofounders to get as much as they could do on their own before hiring long-term employees. In part, because of knowing the code base and the other part, the amount of time you will spend will shift into more manageable tasks, slowing the whole project down.",

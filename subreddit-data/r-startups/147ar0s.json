    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m launching beta for a network effect platform. \n\nI need to get critical mass in one location, but I\u2019m having trouble deciding with where to launch. I have it narrowed down to five states, each state has a handful of cities that are interesting to access potential users. \n\nOne of the ways I am thinking of narrowing it down is to launch some FB ads. \n\nThe initial plan is to buy $20 of FB ads across five states with the same copy and pictures. Run those experiments at the same time then compare results to see if any one of the states had better engagement. \n\nThen the next round of marketing experiments would focus on that state and identify which city. \n\nBut, I\u2019m feeling like $20 per state maybe isn\u2019t enough to give me real results (just false reads). \n\nI have limited budget. Looking for advice, is this plan complete garbage? What are some alternative options to get real data to inform where to launch?\n\nEdit: typos",

    "postText": "Hi Everyone,\n\nFirst time poster over in r/startups but I have lurked for a while.\n\nI have a problem. My small business was using Paypal to process our credit card transactions until about 6 months ago when they shut down out account for violation of their terms of service. They took our entire operational budget(\\~$14k) and locked it in our account for 180days to guard against chargebacks. It nearly killed our business.\u00a0\n\nWell, 180 days just passed and they  went ahead and took the money. Our money. We made and sold the product and they not only held the money (of which there were zero chargebacks), made interest on it for 6mo, and then just deposited it into their account. After two years of working on this business, that money was finally a chance to pay ourselves a little bit for all of our labor, but that is now not possible.\u00a0\n\nWhen we complained, they just gave us the mailing address for the legal dept and refused to be of any help on the phone besides repeating that we had violated their terms of service. Obviously as a small business we have little ability to fight the legal team of a huge financial corporation.\u00a0\n\nAny ideas what to do?",

I'd rather a lawyer go off and win and take half the money than involve me involve me in every step of the process. If dollar value is more important, look at small claims court and see what your states maximum value is you can sue for. Then get all the documentation you have and as much proof you didn't violate terms. There are lots of websites setup to describe the process of suing paypal.",

PayPal has a history of deeming small businesses with sizable amounts of money as \"suspicious\" and taking their money.  I cannot count how many times I have seen this exact same type of post over the years.  I quit doing business with eBay &amp; PayPal years ago over their policies after getting scammed as a seller so I never got screwed like the OP but I have seen many, many others that have.  I would think at a minimum there is a good news story here.",

They won't allow Class Actions per their TOS (which can be voided I think if there is a corrupt intent which I believe there is due to the sheer number of people this happens to) and then purposely seize peoples assets because they are not regulated like a bank and they know it is too expensive for the average person to sue them.  I would try to get a few other legitimate people that had their assets seized by PayPal and contact the NYT or other large news papers.  If that didn't work I would contact the local TV station guys you always see on the News...  Additionally I would file a Better Business Bureau complaint.",

You need to file and then present your argument.\n\nThere's a good chance they don't even show up at which point you get a default judgment.\n\nI don't think you can file for damages in small claims though.\n\nYou could also assert damages here and say that it nearly killed your business, you couldn't make payroll, etc.\n\nThey would also have to pay your lawyer fees.\n\nDon't let people bully you... I know it's rough but if you can figure out a way you should fight.  It will have a negative psychological impact too and you will be less of a hustler in the future.",

There are many companies who's contracts say if you use our service or product for illegal or unauthorized uses, then you owe us damages. This is standard.\n\nIf you were PayPal, think of the liability you have in this world. Someone buys a gun on paypal and kills someone....that estate is going to sue PayPal for millions, not just 2500.\n\nThis guy was selling pipes used to smoke drugs. You think some parent whose kid bought a pipe and then OD'd on meth won't sue PayPal? Of course they would. PayPal has real liability. And to answer your original comparison to a headshop.... let's say this kid was 12. A headshop has regulations not to sell to minors. They have the responsibility to follow the law and they can. A 12 yr old can buy the pipe through PayPal. So, selling through PayPal brings different issues than a headshop and more liability.",

How much money has PayPal lost in lawsuits because they processed a transaction for an illegal product?\n\nFind me another contract for anything that has $2500 (miniumum!) liquidated damages.  Here's what the UCC has to say about it (state law in most states): &lt;wikipedia excerpt&gt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the United States, Section 2-718(1) of the [Uniform Commercial Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Commercial_Code) provides that, in contracts for the sale of goods:[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidated_damages#cite_note-16)\n\nDamages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.\n\nThis largely mirrors the common law rule, which applies to other types of contracts under the law of most US states.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$2500 damages per transaction is clearly unreasonable, and so the term is void in the contract.  That of course doesn't stop PayPal from just taking the money and making you sue them for it.  This is the kind of case that's ripe for a class action, but I imagine PayPal took care of that by putting a mandatory arbitration claim in there too.",

I accept that it can, for no reason, close your account, hit you with fees for whatever reason, pass on chargebacks, etc. But is it really legal to close your account and take all the money in it due to a violation of the TOS? Would it be any different if you had 140k in the account?\n\nI'm assuming this isn't the first time that an issue such as yours has come up and proceeded to court. If so, I am curious as to what the ruling was.\n\nIs there something in PayPal's TOS that lets it do this? I feel like there must be an established answer to your issue.",

Fastest way to get your money back is to tweet and tag the CEO and PayPal support. Had my funds returned in hours.\n\nSwitch to stripe asap.

I have looked at the policy and there seems to be a penalty/liquidated damages provisions whereby you agree (I) to pay 2.5k per violation of the Acceptable Use Policy and (II) that PayPal may deduct those damages directly from you balance. That is presumably the legal basis they are using in the agreement to do this. I assume that they have vetted this provision before its inclusion as being valid under the applicable law. Therefore, unless you are able to claim that there have been no violations of the Acceptable Use Policy or that their maths is wrong (the computation of the liquidated damages clause doesn't allow them to deduct the full amount), it seems to me that they are just applying the terms of the agreement... If you deny the breach, sent them a letter stating that and reserving your rights to go to court and see how they respond.\n\nGood luck!",

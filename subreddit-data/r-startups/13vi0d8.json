    "postText": "I have been sitting on a idea for a long while but due lack of programming knowledge I couldn\u2019t bring it to life or even start from point. Programmers usually cost alot and i do not have that kind of capital on me. I even have tried partnering with programmer to work on it but seems like the programmer isn\u2019t taking much interest to even start working on the idea. One programmer mentioned Apparently programmers only will work if they are paid. So here i am looking for Investor or atleast a guidance towards how i can find an investor and approach him. Any help will be appreciated.\nThank you \u270a\ud83c\udffc",

But you won't be able to raise capital if you don't have a working game and traction, especially now in these economic conditions, it's really hard to raise.",

            "comment": "Game dev isnt as sexy as you think, its really all metrics \n- Cost per user\n- Revenue per user\n- D7/D30 retention\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s tricky, you cant know those numbers without spending atleast a few million in dev and testing in a small market. A mobile game will atleast cost you $500k in dev before you can really test it. A indie PC game probably looking at $2m-$4m. About 80% of games that get to this point will never make the math above work. This is why you hear stories all the time about games in development that never get released.\n\nAnyone who is going to give you serious money is going to want to know you have your bases covered and you can speak intelligently about these metrics from experience. Another key skill is having experience running a game dev team and shipping a game under cost and on time. \n\nIf you dont have this experience and you are still determined I\u2019d recommend (2) avenues.\n\n1. Hyper Casual\nCheck out Voodoo.io these games cost $10k-$20k to make, they partner with dozens/hundreds of small Indie studios. Just attempting to do a hyper casual title would give you so much experience with game dev, optimizing FTUE, reading analytics, marketing, and monetizing.\n\n2. Product Manager\nMost game studios are always looking for talent, they want product managers with an analytics background. Specifically they want people who can look thru tables in the database , create extracts and do analysis on new features effect on the metrics mentioned above. This experience is worth its weight in gold.",

I\u2019m 21 I dropped out of university after 2 years of business I found it boring and not helpful. I love the idea of having my own business and I think the path I need to go down is trial and error. So this is trial one:\n\nBusiness site: aioutfitters.ca\nClothing I make using my embroidery machine, I have people I can pay to make these in my garage if I wanted so scaling fast isn\u2019t an issue, I have money to buy multiple machines so also not an issue most people tell me marketing isn\u2019t an issue but I have a friends with high followers, one with 9.7 mill on insta another with 2.1 on TikTok, multiple with 200,000-500,000 which would all be willing to make ads and take a cut. Not getting into numbers because I know I have that down path my profit margin is 50% and from the numbers I crunched on expected costs, employees, new equipment etc my margin can only go up. I want to also add an accessories page for drop shipping for \u201cpassive income\u201d (I have someone already that will completely run this side of the business) combining multiple products can be tricky like turning a business into an Amazon page but I have a good model for that. Can someone look at the website and let me know what I\u2019m doing wrong? Everything just seems to perfect regards to my plan setup &amp; future and I know that can\u2019t be so what can I do to make this even easier then it seems",

I would suggest you get a tax consultant and a lawyer to check for at least a few hours that you are not making any legal blunders. Then I d suggest to test the waters with your friends. Be sure to put the agreement in writing first so there are less disagreements.",

    "postText": "I have started building app that have some good features that I expect customers will pay for. \n\nThe problem I am too busy and even when I hire other developers the progress is still not that fast since I am funds limitation and time limited. \n\nLong story short, this software that I was expecting to built in 6 months is entering now the 3 year. Although the core is done, but still require more work on UI and some bug fixes. And I am kind of tired of it since I am still unable to release it to public due to mentioned issues, yet I am loosing motivation to work on it as it seem it never ending. \n\nHow to restore my motivation or should I pivit ? although I still think the idea is valid and it worth trying",

            "comment": "As an app developer I see this a lot. People start out using cheap developers who lowball the project and it turns into a time and money pit. \n\nHow over budget are you, and do you have the funds to get it finished? Because whatever you are expecting it to cost to finish, double that. If you still have that amount to spend, do it. Otherwise, cut your losses and/or try to sell what you have. \n\nGood luck.",

If this is useful, I may also try to answer the logical follow up question next: \u201cHow do I raise capital.\u201d Let me know if you\u2019d be interested in seeing that.\n\nNOTE: This post got removed due to a link on the image, so I removed that and am reposting.",

In an environment in which other modes of financing are largely unavailable to these kinds of founders, raising VC &amp; swinging for the fences is a more logical practice for founders who otherwise could never take the first step.\n\nHaving said that, there are *far to many* people building consumer software, lite business saas, consumer D2C tchotchkes, etc. who have absolutely no business raising VC money without real traction, let alone before they make an effort to build a business at all.",

It's irrelevant to say X% of businesses don't raise VC if 50%+ aren't trying to grow at all (contractor LLCs, consultants, and part-time home businesses) and another 30% are restaurants, laundromats, etc.\n\nGrowth businesses that take on actual market risk and/or technology risk for higher potential upside are a *totally* different type of company than the vast majority of businesses started in the US today. Combining the two together makes no real sense if we want to get a realistic understanding of the landscape and the dynamics of starting and operating these businesses.",

Which is why I was responding to a specific piece of feedback about this specific piece of content having so many endings of \"don't raise VC\" and the response being you can do it but it's hard. Many of these endings aren't VC appropriate so not raising it isn't an alternative path to that style of Funding, it's just another type of business, like those you mention. There isn't a way to get creative in funding and change that and make them VC appropriate or maybe even private equity appropriate.\n\n The fact still stands that most businesses, as in 99%+ don't raise VC and many are successful. Of the ones remaining that meet all the criteria many will raise VC and still very few will be successful.  In the margins is a tiny tiny tiny group who don't raise VC and still build a VC appropriate business. The process of doing that doesn't invent its own form of math relative to spending less than you make and reinvestment with what you can get or finding alternative funding source that are creative to get over funding energy thresholds. In addition, many of the same \"don't raise\" rules apply to private equity and even more apply to a bank.",

Instead, I advocate for people to offer services to the same target market then use those proceeds to build their other company (in my case product companies).  This is good for several reasons, you keep control and don't have an arbitrary expiration date on your startup, and you're learning more about the challenges in your target market every day and even getting paid to do so. The cons are it's slower and you have to split time. These are OK with me. Especially since it's a marathon and not a sprint.",

Maybe a 99\u20ac/year developer account to Apple when they're ready to ship their iOS app.\n\nWhere most people fall flat is they don't have a \"couple of dudes\". They didn't go to Stanford or some other good university and didn't participate in the countless projects/hackathons/startup courses. They didn't network and don't have a couple of brilliant friends that would be totally game to try out new ideas and probably have most of the code, most of the marketing stuff, most of the pitch decks etc. ready to go because this isn't their first rodeo and they've done this before in the courses/hackathons/projects before.\n\nI mean groups of friends release apps, games websites etc. FOR FUN without ever thinking about how to make a single cent of money out of it. They'd be happy if the ad revenue covers the server costs so they break even and that's it.\n\nBrowse this sub. Most people in here are completely incompetent and unprepared. They struggle to get an MVP or to get their first users.\n\nWhen I was young, we'd make iOS and Android apps and maintain the website + forums for the videogame community we played with. We had chatbots, customer service, webstore to sell merch to help pay for the server costs (back when you needed a $300/month dedicated server to run game servers) and all kinds of things. We did it for fun and because learning how to make mobile apps that integrate with the game and the rest of the community was cool and you could put it on your resume. If we'd hire someone to do it, it would probably cost 150-250k to get it done and a ton of money to keep it maintained.\n\nPeople think they need money to do things. What they really need is some skills and some friends that also think it's a great idea that also have some skills.",

A few hundred thousand? Definitely. I will definitely need a few hundred thousand, being very optimistic, to get the product to manufacturing. Even if I was doing software - the company could benefit from some capital.

No you don't.\n\nEveryone benefits from money. Need =/= want. Everyone wants money, that is just natural. But startups don't need money beyond let's say 10k for materials, compute credit etc.\n\nIf you had the perfect skills and the perfect team and the perfect network, would you still need capital? The answer to that is \"probably no\". Sure you'll need a thousand bucks to keep things running, but you don't really need an investor for that. Hell, even a few tens of thousands is easy for the average person to save up over the years.\n\nWhen people say \"I need capital\", what they really mean is \"I don't have the competency, my team is shit and I don't know what I'm doing\".\n\nYou don't need capital from investors to start making a product. Sure it might be hand-crafted and not very profitable because of economies of scale and you might price out most of the market, but you don't NEED it.\n\nInvestments are a cheat-code to speed up scaling up, improving the yield, speed up the growth etc. If you \"need\" capital to make it happen (instead of speeding things up), then you've already failed and haven't thought it through.\n\nTypical scenario on this hub: Get a bunch of money together (your own and maybe friends and family), hire some people, by some miracle have it not fail miserably aaaaaand nobody wants your product.\n\nNow instead of $50 in Arduino stuff and $10 in 3d printer filament and your own time, you've spent 100k on something that nobody wants.\n\nYou don't need capital for startups. For traditional businesses such as a restaurant or a factory or whatever, sure. And you take out a bank loan for that and use the equipment you buy as collateral and so on. \n\nBut for a startup that is based on innovation, you don't need capital. You need skills, you need knowledge, you need connections. Things you don't need money for.\n\nI for example know a local society, a \"hacklab\" of sorts. They have 3D printers, they have a CNC machine, they have a laser engraver etc. and they have a deal with the local trade school that they can use their equipment after school hours so there's pretty much a full workshop you have access to. Startup activity is perfectly fine, in fact that's basically where all the local startups come from. I just happen to know a guy that knows a guy and voila, no need for 80k-150k worth of equipment because I had the necessary connections. I could start a startup and start producing and selling the product (even if it's not the final form and the price is outrageous and I don't really make a big profit on it). It's sales and it's not that I NEED capital, it's that a potential investor could speed things up and make money by themselves. But I am just fine without the capital, I just won't make as much money as fast. Maybe the exit will be 150k instead of 150 million, maybe it will be in 5 years instead of 3 years. But I don't NEED capital.",

Basically the idea was to embed smart sensors into the curbs of each parking space which would tell you it's occupancy in real time. I got interest a lot of interest from  \nschools - college admin hated when students parked in their designated spots and tesla charging space. Also colleges already sold parking passes that did not meet demand so students often circled looking for spots especially in larger campuses. So the school could sell you a parking pass for say $600 a semester, and $100 smart parking membership to help you find spots.  \nlocal governments - this was interesting because there was a large multi-million dollar company looking to enter the city I lived in but the pitch local officials like was that I was home grown and that large companies will absolutely rip you and you're citizens off if they can legally get away with it. At this time, one of the cities red light camera vendors was found to have been padding up stats to increase their revenue which led to the city effectively losing out on red light camera tickets for 2 years. The city had a $30M budget deficit. My plan was simple, I would tell the city which spots were occupied so parking enforcement ticketing would increase thus leading to higher general parking revenue as more people paid out of fear of parking tickets. The city was currently doing 370k tickets per year generating about $13M annually, I said I could increase the tickets 5x and revenue to $60M. They actually told me to start talking about how this was about public safety although politically it was a way to raise funds without calling it a tax. One Midwest governor, I think Kansas, who wanted to focus on smart cities wanted me to relocate.

NYC generates $500M in parking tickets annually, I could easily increase it to $5B for example.   \n\n\nOne VC actually said this was the best pitch and numbers he's seen. I excitedly asked if that meant he would join the round, he said no, we both laughed.  \n\n\nHere's a link -  [SRCGU Business Plan 2017.docx](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AuduOQaixDONga5ON-FkBXdRppt9Lw?e=ATsoIK)\n\n [Business plan](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AuduOQaixDONga5ON-FkBXdRppt9Lw?e=ATsoIK)",

I got eliminated next round, the winners were wayyy more advanced and had working products.\n\nYou could make a huge argument for public safety. I worked in security at a highend neighbor and saw just how slow enforcement whether police or traffic was. Parking enforcement had one person patrolling large sections of the city. They would sometimes only come around once every two hours or twice a day. Sometimes cops were used but cops saw parking enforcement as down time so they didn\u2019t really try. \n\nPeople double parked, blocking roadway and reducing visibility for other drivers and pedestrians, just so they could shop or buy ice cream, which took more than a second (usually 5-10mins+). The odds of getting caught for parking is extremely low. To prove the point I intentionally illegally parked everywhere and even during my meeting with the official, i had never gotten a ticket. \n\n\nThere were 3 stages\nStage 1 crowdsourcing parking enforcement via a Snapchat like app that allows you to fill out the report without ever touching the car\nIf you see a car illegally parked, take a picture and video of it within the app, fill out a report (make, model, plates, location, etc), submit it and walk away. A city official will review it. If they approve it, they issue the ticket. They pay me $10 of the $32 ticket, I give you $5 to $7, everyone\u2019s happy. If you\u2019re report is wrong though, you are fined 3x of what ever the compensation would have been. So you now have to pay $15 in fines. $5 goes to the city for admin cost, $5 goes to the person you incorrectly reported, $5 goes to me. So it really puts accountability back into the system. There are cities where they ticket you to meet a quota regardless of if it\u2019s valid knowing the odds of you appealing is low (why waste 2 hours of you\u2019re day driving to and from court for a $32 ticket?). \n\nA few investors thought it was a great deal for cities who could cut labor and benefit costs which would justify the contract alone.\n\nPhase 2- smart parking described above\n\nAnother thing is if you don\u2019t drive a car you don\u2019t necessarily care about this program. Hell you could even make money from it. \n\nIf you do have a car, reactions would be 50/50. On one hand you would feel like it only applies to selfish and bad drives who block lanes. You wouldn\u2019t go out of you\u2019re way to report someone for $5+ unless it was egregious.\nOn the other hand if you\u2019re caught, you would be salty as hell",

Selling to governments is notoriously slow and difficult and \"gov tech\" has only really caught on in 2017+.\n2. VCs are also super skeptical of outsourcing all the tech talent because it goes tits up more often than not. Hardware takes more time and money than you expect, and someone with no experience in getting products manufactured (especially electronics) can make some expensive rookie mistakes while learning the ropes.\n3. Reputation risk. Not a lot of investors want to be publicly shamed for backing shit like hardware that increases ticket revenue for cities on the backs of city residents.

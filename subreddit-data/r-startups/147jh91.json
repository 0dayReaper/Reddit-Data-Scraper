    "postText": "I had an initial business idea and while I'm currently out of the country for a couple of months, I agreed to let my friend take care of our start-up in my absence. We haven't drafted a contract yet, but now I want to end our partnership because my friend has failed to prove his worthiness. He talks a big game and claims to be driven, but he hasn't lived up to my expectations. He couldn't contribute capital to our joint bank account, and it's become apparent that he lacks knowledge in business, requiring me to teach him what I know. Moreover, he constantly makes excuses about being busy with his 9-5 job and personal life, which has caused significant delays in our progress. And since we're friends, he expects me to understand his circumstances, knowing he's less fortunate and has financial responsibilities, including debts and impending fatherhood.\rAdditonally, I also can't shake the feeling that he's probably taking advantage of me due to my knowledge and resources. He once quoted this from rich dad, poor dad \"you just have to know a little of a lot and you can hire people smarter than you,\" which makes me believe I'm that smarter guy and he's also using me as a stepping stone. \n\r  \nOne particular red flag occurred when I assigned him the task of purchasing materials for our R&amp;D. He claimed to be too busy and entrusted the task to our mutual friend. Although our friend managed to purchase the materials and provided the receipts, the change was being kept, and obtaining a copy of the receipt took considerable effort. As for the change, he promised to return it on his payday, which was yesterday, yet I still haven't received any updates regarding it.\r  \n\r  \nI no longer wish to tolerate these B.S. I understand my own mistake in this situation, and I do feel incredibly stupid. I have forgiven these 2 friends already, but I no longer want to continue this partnership. How do I terminate this partnership while still maintaining our friendship if it still is possible? I would greatly appreciate any advice. To break the news will most likely be a surprise and he won't take it well.",

            "comment": "You should expect that you\u2019re going to save both. You\u2019ll have some uncomfortable conversations with these friends, but anticipate success. \n\nIf they are real friends, then I\u2019d hope your relationships is stronger than this encounter. This, combined with the fact that they probably know they haven\u2019t lived up to your expectations, gives you what you need. \n\nI\u2019d start by asking your one friend how they think they\u2019ve done in their stewardship?\n\nIf they come clean and say \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lived up to what you wanted/needed\u201d, then you\u2019re all set to have the conversation you need to have (this isn\u2019t working, I think best we part ways, etc). \n\nIf they come back and say \u201cI think I killed it!\u201d, then it gets trickier. You can dig further to understand why, and then use whatever information they provide to contrast against what you expect/need. If you can help them to see the delta, then it can open up the conversation you need to have. \n\nMake sure they\u2019re fairly compensated. Don\u2019t let reasonable money expectations be the reason things go south. Even if it\u2019s uncomfortable or you think it\u2019s more than they deserve, you should just pay it if you want to preserve the relationship. For clarity, I\u2019m talking in the 20-30% more than what you think they should receive. \n\nHowever, there is the scenario that the conversation goes south, or they demand something from you you don\u2019t think is in the realm of fair (ie compensation 2x what you think they should receive). \n\nIn that scenario, it\u2019ll be critical for you to remain calm. Don\u2019t let it get heated. Ask lots of questions. Let them say their piece. Don\u2019t commit to anything you don\u2019t believe in or feel uncomfortable about. Tell them you need time to think and consider. Basically your game in this situation is to let them blow off steam, head out their position, and push off making any real decisions until you\u2019ve had a chance to think things through, and come up with some answers. \n\nIf the convo goes south, follow the above guidance, and then come back and share your experience\u2014happy to give advice from there.",

Give your co-founder the opportunity to step up - set clear metrics and milestones for both of you to keep each honest. \n\nThe second thought I would have is do you trust your friend? It seems you do. Trust is much harder to establish than finding skills to me. \n\nIf you trust them then you can have this honest conversation and just say how can we get you to a point to contribute and \"upskill\"? That trust should allow you to bridge these difficult conversations.",

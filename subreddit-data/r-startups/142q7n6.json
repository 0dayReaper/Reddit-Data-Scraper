    "postText": "Hi all, I\u2019m working on a new software product, and am looking for a technical advisor to give mentorship on architecture, processes, potential technical pitfalls and best practices. \nMy initial thought was to hire a qualified consultant on a part-time basis, but I had another thought I was interested in exploring.\nCurrently I work as a fractional CFO/consultant for several venture-backed startups, and a couple that have exited to PE firms. I\u2019ve helped many companies get their financial stories in order for the fundraising process and after. \n\nAs such, I thought it would be more interesting to \u2018trade\u2019 mentorship with an aspiring startup CTO who can easily provide guidance on what backend frameworks would be best for my product, but struggle to calculate the contribution margin or LTV for their own startup. \n\nAssuming this is feasible, where would I go to find a good technical \u2018match\u2019? Does anyone have experience doing something similar?",

In truth for mvps it almost doesn't matter frankly.  Although some product do require specialized tooling.  For example real time systems.  Or healthcare as it sometimes deals with hipaa.  \n\nIf you want to chat more you can dm me.  I am full stack and mobile as well.  I actually spend quite a bit of time looking at technologies as there is alot of marketing in tech and often times when you get beyond the marketing you find there is alot missing from a product.  I have been looking at desktop development over the past few days which is much more problematic then it should be.",

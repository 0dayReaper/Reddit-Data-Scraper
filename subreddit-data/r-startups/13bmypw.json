    "postText": " We hired two executives who were CSO and CMO for our 20 people team. We know them before hiring for a long time and they were great people to collaborate with. However, we faced lots of problems.\n\n* They were used to a rigid hierarchy and bureaucratic decision-making process, which clashed with our flat organization and emphasis on agility.\n* They insisted on using buzzwords and corporate jargon, leading to a lot of confusion and eye-rolling and a more passive-aggressive approach.\n* They were more concerned with playing politics and jockeying for power than actually getting things done.\n* They were both guilty of toxic behavior, including micromanaging when things didn't go their way.\n* They were quick to play office politics, forming alliances and cliques with certain team members and excluding others.\n* They were both guilty of gatekeeping, hoarding information and resources and only sharing them with their chosen favorites.\n* They seemed more interested in preserving their own power and status than in promoting the success of the company as a whole.\n* They never believed they are doing wrong or something is going wrong. The defense is \"I have 10 years of experience and it is how it is done!\"\n\nWe are a young team and of course there are lots of things missing. However, if the hires from corporate do not aim to fill in the blanks, they create new blanks and try to change you and try to convince you that you are TOTALLY wrong as a whole team.\n\nWe learned that review the process with sincere feedback from the core team before any hiring. Agree on everything that should be talked about and agreed on. We did not continue working with them.",

            "comment": "This is exactly what happens when you hire folks that don't have a successful startup past. A lot of companies make an investment in buying experienced talent from industry leaders and end up buying a toxic cultural influence that doesn't know how to move fast and instead replicate the structures they have seen in these organizations, as if these weren't _symptoms_, but the _cause_ of success in these organizations. They end up creating committees and power structures and reduce focus on individual expertise to make the organization more professional and scalable, but this is the phase where you can lose a lot of the DNA that made the company successful. And you can create attrition as a side effect of this cultural change.",

                            "comment": "Most corporate environments are not focused on hyper growth, but maintaining steady growth or status quo. This means that personal growth means pushing someone else to the side, not waiting until the company have doubled in size and now _needs_ someone to _manage_ support, operations, engineering, procurement, supply chain, accounting etc. or some aspect of a function that did not have a leadership position before, and until then, there's often no considerable equity to compensate for the pack of a true leadership position.\n\nWhen you hire leadership roles from industry, you don't hire the best in their field; you definitely hire the best in politics from that org though, that _at one time_ were good at something they actually did themselves, but _now_ they are hopefully really good at picking and motivating people, organizing work streams etc.\n\nNow you put them in a startup and they are faced with by now unusual problems:\n\n_Who will do the work?_ They don't have enough underlings, and can't be bothered anymore to do the actual work _themselves_, and their skills in doing that are dated anyway. So they feel they compete with others for resources. Their departments will need to grow, because that's a sure way to solve this problem of not having enough resources, and it also propels them further upwards because they now have a bigger org to run, more responsibility, and can demand promotions, more equity, etc.\n\n_Why isn't there a process?_ Not being used to the enormous freedom awarded by a startup environment, the thing they wished for the most - _being able to move the needle, and do what's right, without constraints!_ - becomes a challenge: None of the guardrails they were used to and took for granted exist here - small things or big things - and defining these falls outside their expertise. They can have endless discussions on these minute details or just subscribe to the belief that however their past employer did it was _industry best practice_ and you should do it this way.",

It's better there to remain steady than take a risk and then not won. A culture that rewards not taking a risk is incompatible with one that thrives on it.",

Little things at first, like adopting the HR manual, vacation schedule, aligning benefits. Then HR moved over entirely. IT, too. Our research group moved over after that, and now operations. Many of the founders either changed roles to something within the enterprise or left entirely, and were replaced with corporate types who don't have the startup vibe.

            "comment": "&gt; gatekeeping, hoarding information and resources and only sharing them with their chosen favorites\n\nI long ago discovered how these are the two most important aspects to power; corporate power or political power.\n\nControl of information is fantastically critical. If you can control and \"shape\" the information going up, you control the narrative, if you deny information to your subordinates, you deny them power.\n\nBut if you cultivate a small number of key subordinates and make sure to reward them, they will remain loyal and you will then be able to ride them to even more power, while they protect you as that is now in their interests.\n\nThis goes back to a feudal chief who would have a small group of thugs(knights) who would keep the peasants in line. \n\nOddly enough there is even math for this, basically it is a formula where you have to balance what percentage of the population you keep close and how replaceable they are. They can't be too frequently replaced as you lose loyalty, but if they are too safe, they  grow complacent. If there are too many, they are too costly to support, if they are too few, you can get overthrown.\n\nIf you are an executive in a large corporate environment, you perfect these skills, or you die. If you aren't an executive and you don't learn these skills, you don't become an executive. Many people are either naturally good at these, or they learn them instinctively. Only the most powerful are the ones who really consciously use them.\n\nThis is why you never hire these people for a startup. There are way too many idiots from similar corporate environments who think a startup should have some \"adults\" in the room. My theory is that healthy startups with a fairly flat open structure make people from these horrible environments nervous as they know they would not do well in them.\n\nBy the way, the name we gave the \"in\" group in one particular company was \"the treehouse.\"\n\nWhat I love in the tech world is competing with companies that begin to self-destruct with these policies. By reflexively keeping everyone else in the dark, it usually means nearly everyone is missing key data to make proper decisions. Combine this with driving top talent away and you have the perfect recipe for a company which can't (to use their own stupid term) execute.\n\nBTW I will make a simple prediction for these bozos (if they are still around as you end your post with \"We did not continue working with them.\") . If they haven't already, they will start to jack up their remuneration. Not a little bit, but by massive increments. When they give everyone a \"generous in these tight times\" raise of 3% they will jack their total renumeration up 80%. They will also start locking in weird benefits (in that nobody had these before) such as massive severance packages, and bonuses off the charts if they sell the company or raise a huge pile of cash. And the options, oh, I can just see the options they will give themselves. Once they have options they will start to play games to get those options worth a fortune. \n\nIf the company sells, they will also make sure they get retention bonuses which are obscene. If they drive the company into bankruptcy, again with the retention bonuses.\n\nAlso, what I've found when corporate bozos like this come in they quickly start pushing out any actual leaders within the company. If there is someone who is running engineering very well, they will bring in a B-school friend as CTO and now the old engineering head reports to the CTO. The IT was nicely going along, but now they outsource it to a company they are largely the only ones with any control over. They bring in an HR person where none was needed. Then they start rewiring corporate structure. This is where the big rewiring of how shares are allocated and to whom is important. What I've seen here is they realize there are say 2 hands off founders with more than 51% of the voting shares. They will do their damndest to break that in any way possible. Bring in a new board of directors who somehow were structured to override the 51% or convince the shareholders that \"institutional investors\" don't like the share structure and a common share structure is key.",

After completing the series B round, there were more execs than actual ICs. Things went from hustle culture to buzzword salad overnight and those who actually had the background and experience to get the startup to that point were pushed to the back in terms of decision making. \n\nWe went a whole frustrating year without any major decision being made by the C suite and that broke the company\u2019s pace. The CEO became more interested in furthering his ability to sell shares on the secondary market while the execs were using the prior success of the startup as a springboard. Anyone and everyone who got them their initial success were either laid off or quit to finally go do something of value again.\n\nFor as much as I worked to make that place successful, the most frustrating part was to see indecisive and out-of-touch execs completely gut it.",

Most have my personal cellphone.\n\nI was trying to fill a key role and had someone who checked all the boxes.  Gave my employees a chance to review and interview.  Everyone gave her the thumbs up.\n\nI had to fire her in a week for a bunch of other issues.  When I broke the news to my employees they all told me \u201coh none of us liked her anyway, she didn\u2019t have the technical knowledge for this role.\u201d\n\nWTF.  I literally asked you guys this directly last week and not a single person brought up any concerns at all.  Not one.\n\nGave them a very clear and stern direction: if you guys are not honest with me and do not present issues within a timely manner, you will be the ones dealing with the issues, since in this case you would have had to work with this person daily!  Do we understand?\n\nThey understood so much so that ethos is now baked into our core principles.\n\nCandidate 2 for the role a few months later.  (Noteworthy, this is a 6 figure role). Same process, looks good on paper, checks all the boxes, team gives her a good review.\n\nOffer doesn\u2019t work out. Whatever nbd.  Let the team know.  Same fucking thing!  \u201cOh we didn\u2019t like her, xyz we\u2019re all issues.\u201d\n\nWhat the actual fucking fuck!  We just had this conversation.\n\nYea, after that employee feedback doesn\u2019t carry anywhere near the weight it used to.\n\nWhy?  A lot of reasons.  The two above examples are not original stories.  Also, employees often times don\u2019t even know what they want or know how to articulate it.  They also definitely don\u2019t know what the company needs as a whole.  These points all have me now reconsidering how much I listen to my employees as a whole when they speak.

In a larger organization there are of course the business goals, as well as the goal of building a business case for your department, costs, and team structure. In addition to things like repeatable processes, managing up, budgeting and financial planning and of course even reporting requirements for public companies. \n\nThese skills are very different than building a product, business, and having a quick impact.  But these \u201ccorporate\u201d skills become essential as your organization grows and gets more complicated.  \n\nWhere startups go wrong is hiring these types of folks either two early or two late. And many startups won\u2019t grow big enough to need this corporate skill set. \n\nFirst up, I don\u2019t think big company folks have any place on your company till you get ro around $20M - that is when you start to need people with experience at a larger scale.  And then there are lore breaking points around $100M and $500M. \n\nYou\u2019ll probably want folks a little more experienced with a larger startup after you hit $5-10M - but these don\u2019t need to be big company folks. Just folks that have been at a place that has scaled from 10-15ish folks to 70-100 folks. These are very different skills than having hundreds or thousands of employees. \n\nYou hired these big company folks too early. They want to build repeatable processes and department empires.  You still need folks that can wear multiple hats and jump into help outside their expertise. And folks with broad exposure to many areas of the business. Build mode is very different than scale mode which is different than execute at scale mode.",

A marketing partner is fine if a you\u2019re highly technical team, but as many others have said, most these executives won\u2019t come in, roll up their sleeves and get the work done. A big red flag is a need to hire a team to make impact. If they don\u2019t know how to make impact, they sure as sh*t won\u2019t be able to lead a team to make impact. Also beware of their request of \u201cwe need to hire some contractors\u201d ; or, \u201cI can\u2019t make impact because x, y, z isn\u2019t set up yet\u201d.

You can learn a lot working with the right one, and easily cut paths with them at the first sign of it not being the right fit. Best case scenario you can extend their contract or work with them to help hire the right person for the job.\n\nGood luck!",

You may very well find you are right and that's great but it's definitely silly to not consider you might be wrong. \n\nBad fits happen all the time but as a founder, the buck stops with you.

We lost our momentum and after 1 year we are closing down soon. Funny thing is that my parents warned me about it. They said the founders hired fat cats. High salary and wont provide much in terms of results.",

In my most recent company, backers (tech PE) were very keen to bring in new c-suite members from blue chip big tech backgrounds. Unfortunately, they (and much of their reports whom they hand picked) spent all their time playing politics and spinning their wheels. I have never seen anything quite like it - the company became a toxic place to work and went sideways.",

If I learned one thing and one thing only participating in this corporate bs it\u2019s that these people are the number one reason why startups are able to beat bigger companies at all. NOT being like this can be a tremendous advantage. I worked on projects which could easily have been finished in half the time if you\u2019d fire all the managers without replacing them at all.

    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nPerhaps market research is wrong term. Basically we can\u2019t find any evidence that anyone has already done the idea, so I need to prove that our target demographic would be interested in doing it. \n\nApologies to be a walking stereotype but I am paranoid that someone will clock on and steal the idea, because it appears to us to be a gaping hole in the market. We are still a ways off from it coming to fruition and this primary research is the first step towards securing some initial investment. \n\nCan I put an NDA at the front of my survey? Or instead should we try format questions to make the idea less obvious? Or a different approach? If anyone has been in this position and can offer advice or point me in the direction of what to do, that would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks.",

Much like patents.\n\nUnless the market is very specialized, I doubt people will be willing to sign an nda even just to know what the idea is.  Especially if its nothing more than a concept.  You might have ot build an mvp, or a wireframe or something to demonstrate to people what it is.",

Don't be afraid that other people will \"steal\" your idea because once you launch publicly everyone will be able to \"steal\" it, and what makes you think having only several months of head start (time for mvp launch) guarantees your win? Most people see your idea and literally just move on.",

            "comment": "If you put a NDA infront a survey you have to factor in the opportunity cost of losing out on high quality feedback to validate your idea and get a deep understanding of user needs to accelerate product-market fit. \n\nInvestors wants to see traction. Your ability to demonstrate you can validate a problem exist with data and connect it to a great problem-solution fit. \n\nThat is going to be hard (not impossible) with the paranoid approach. But ultimatively you need to make a decision about how you want to approach this.\n\nOne thing worth considering. If you have found this gap in the market. Then go ahead and pre-sell it to your ICP. The ones that have the pain you solve and have it as a high priority will commit to paying or express they will pay. That is superb traction to show investors.\n\nBest of luck!",

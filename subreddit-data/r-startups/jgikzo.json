    "postText": "After losing my job in December of 2019, I decided to step into bootstrapping my own ideas for a while.\n\nFirst (don't do this), I worked for more than 6 months on my first idea, a very simple one, but difficult to execute. An email service provider. It wasn't easy, but I did it.\n\nI launched. 1 upvote on Product Hunt, mine... Crickets. I probably cry on the inside.\n\nAfter spending an immense amount of hours tweaking and fixing and making sure everything was workings, 99.9% of the visits to the landing page, never past from there.\n\n2,058 visits since 20th May. 0 clients. No one has seen my app.\n\nAfter that, I thought: Ok, if people don't pass from the landing page, I am going to create landing pages and test ideas.\n\n**So I create:**\n\n*  An alternative to Couchsurfing: 2,162 visits. I made more money from it than from the first project. And I did it in one weekend.\n* A coffee community, 1,716 visits. I got a bit excited and did some features.\n* A digital nomads community in Spanish.\n* Product Hunt in Spanish.\n* SaaS for teachers to simply communicate with students over email, this is using the technology that I created for the first project.\n\nAll failed.\n\n**What I learned**\n\n* Don't rush into solutions. Find people that have a real problem, talk to them, and then, think of solutions. Every problem, has many solutions, don't rush into making the first one that you can think of.\n* Find clients before making anything. I always think... I will make it share it, and people will see and use it. It doesn't work like that.\n* Don't do it if you need money NOW. Making a product's success takes time. If you are doing it for the money, you are going to rush into the wrong decisions.\n\nThat's it. Honestly, I sometimes think to stop and to just work for others. I think that I don't have it, or that I am just not good enough.\n\nBut I keep trying. I can't help it. I am sure many of you can relate. At the end of the day, you only need to win once.",

Success is a game of probabilities, so if you try enough times, you will eventually succeed. As a bonus, after each failure, the probabilities get better",

But they take time, practice, and patience. There\u2019s many tools now to automate a lot of this for you, like Hubspot or any of the other major marketing automation platforms.\n\nSecondly, is processes and business models. You can\u2019t just sell one-offs (I mean you can if you\u2019re\nselling a physical good), but when it comes to software, software as a service is the way to go. The reason? Recurring revenue. That lets you invest, forecast, and continue to deliver sustained value and revenue. \n\nBut it also means building processes to maintain and run your business so you can scale it, and bootstrap at the same time without working 100-hours a week. \n\nYou want to create playbooks on how to do everything in your business, and either automate it, or make it repeatable by others so you can train someone else to do it exactly the way you want it done. \n\nLastly, PR, SEO, and getting mentioned on major websites is important but those are icing on the cake. You can\u2019t rely on them forever. What you can rely on forever is targeted advertising. \n\nWhat you need to figure out in your pricing, and business model is the following equation: If I spend X on targeting advertising, what kind of sales can I make?\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you spend $1000 on targeted ads for a product that charges $29 per month. That means you only need to convert 35 people to paying customers to draw even / a slight profit. If you can optimize your conversions and sales pitch so that $1000 of ads gets you 50 customers, you\u2019re now making $450 in profit on top of your original ad spend. That\u2019s a solid return on investment, and now you can start printing money, because the more you spend on ads the more profit you make as long as your conversions hold. Plus since you\u2019re charging monthly, each month the money snowballs and your Monthly Recurring Revenue MRR grows. Which in turn gives you more money to invest in getting new customers.\n\nCrack this equation on any of your products and you\u2019re printing money.",

It seems to have some aspects to your thoughts around an app for managing depression.  I\u2019ll post the description that he wrote, and if you\u2019re interested, I can try to connect you to him:\n\n\n\nFitness/Mood tracker?\n\nI've suffered massively with mental health over recent years for the usual myriad of reasons - work, money, family problems etc. What has always helped me has been exercise.\n\nThe struggle when you're depressed is doing anything, even if you know it will help, is a challenge. In my case the longer I don't exercise the worse my mood gets and the harder it is to break that cycle.\n\nI'm thinking about a simple app, that encourages you to exercise for the mental health benefits. Some sort of mood tracker linked to the exercise you do. It can give you regular affirmations of the positive impact exercise has had in the past, help maintain momentum while training, or send prompts to exercises you've done before which gave you a boost.\n\nI'm considering this as a side project to motivate me personally but if it could be useful to others and viable then I could see myself running this as a business full time. I know the fitness and mental health spaces are massively saturated right now, so:\n\n\n\n1)\tDo you think there is an opportunity for an app like this\n\n2)\tCan anyone point me to any sources about how to track mood in a clinical or objective way? This isn't intended to be super science based, but if there's standards I can use instead trying to come up with my own metrics it would be much better",

You go onto headspace and it logs how many minutes of meditation you've done. These fitness trackers will measure how many reps and sets of exercise you've performed. Doesn't the notion of self acceptance directly conflict with the obsession of measurement we've placed on ourselves? Likes on Instagram/Facebook, Karma on Reddit, how big your daily calorie deficit is. \n\nThe major asssumption I'm making here is that improving the general sense of self acceptance around us will have a positive effect on people's mental health.\n\nHow do you build a successful app from this? I'm not too sure.\n\nI know i've gone off on a tangent to loneliness and isolation, but I think these ideas are all somehow linked",

First identify a business problem or challenge in some specific domain space, talk to potential customers about solutions you could provide, and maybe even ask how much they\u2019d pay for the product, then after that build and deliver the product. There\u2019s a really good book called \u201cThe Mom Test\u201d and it outlines how to identify problems and build startups to address it. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/geeZqaHaX80\n\n&gt; Don't do it if you need money NOW. Making a product's success takes time. If you are doing it for the money, you are going to rush into the wrong decisions.\n\nAnother good point. If you desperately need money to live then you need to find a regular job or freelance by taking different contract engagements. First pay your bills and then after that think about starting a business or putting your time and effort in to a project.",

Many others are stuck in the planning phase. Planning for years without actually getting anything done. That's just plain dumb.\n\nStart with an MVP, something simple that you can use on your landing page and gain feedback. I think it's great if you can start getting paid deposits from the get-go. Get the prospects to put their money where their mouth is. A lot of people can tap a button that says \"Yeah I'll buy that\" but when it comes to fishing out their credit cards.. crickets.\n\nLook for solutions and build buzz. The best product launches don't happen overnight. There's a lot of back end legwork done in advance and the buzz grows with long chain of events before it. Grow interest and build a community. That's what doing good business is all about.\n\nThe last thing I'll say is this, don't blow your budget on marketing. Get some initial customers and fine tune your offering based on their feedback. Mind you PAYING customers. Once your offering is solid and you have some recurring income, start pushing paid ads. This advice is two-fold. Your newly acquired audience get to experience a bigger and better offering. There'll be more interest in it then. At the same time, you have a solid following that came relatively organically. When you treat these folks well, they'll be your raving fans. That's your support system. You won't have the problem of missed KPIs when your paid ad taps get turned off (this happens very often with rule and algorithm changes. Some businesses go broke because of this).",

Do it the traditional way.\n\nIf you do insist to run ads, do it to a landing page and optimize it for sign ups instead of acquisition. That shows interest. Squeeze pages are actually pretty awesome but all the pieces need to be right. I've seen strategies where you charge an upfront $1 deposit that promises a free or lowered 1st month membership fee. Maybe offer a 14-day free cancellation or something? It's a low fee but shows real commitment.\n\nPersonally, I think a free sign up is good enough. It depends on how good your offering is. If it's solving a real-life problem that people can't live without, charging a fee is okay. If it's a nice to have, free is better.\n\nIt comes down to what your offering is. The goal here is to get your sales message right and your audience targeting right. That's the secret sauce. More often than not, these 2 aren't cohesive and that's the problem.\n\nI'd recommend reading up on the Russell Brunson Secrets trilogy. He hits home a ton of valuable lessons in business like the Dream 100, Value Ladder, Though Leadership and Sales Messaging. Lots of nuggets that can be implemented and is evergreen.",

First just do exploratory interviews and listen and probe. This takes experience to do well but, really, anyone can do it. \n\nNow you should see some patterns and struggles. Read about JTBD, Bob Moesta, if you haven't already. You should have enough insight to form some hypotheses and from here you can pull together some concepts in tbe form of wireframes. You can go hi-fi if you want but the ROI on your time here is probably still low. Loose concepts are fine. \n\nGo back to more users, listen some more, and at the end show them your concept and hear what they think they're seeing and supposed to do. You want to hear excitement, interest, volunteers who say things like \"I'd love to try something like this\". \n\nSo far this didn't cost you anything (maybe some Amazon gift cards if you want to offer an incentive) besides your time. You are sooooooooo much farther ahead than most.\n\nGo figure out your design and your MVP.  Keep showing users as you go.",

    "postText": "After 12 years building and working at startups I've developed a high impact methodology to building mobile / cloud MVPs which can take startups from nothing into a marketable, investible product in a timespan from a few weeks to a few months depending on the complexity. A one man team. I understand that not all startup founders are technically minded and that this type of service is exactly what some of you may need. I imagine there are many in this subreddit like me with this unique skillset, not looking for equity, just a gig to allow them to continue their own startup journey. As a community I think it would be valuable to combine high impact performers with non-technical startup founders, to service this end. I believe these skills are specific to startups and potentially belong within this community, perhaps a weekly sticky post. Thoughts?",

                    "comment": "I'm a non-technical founder, and I'll happily share my methodology. I built my first software company to over 40,000 users before selling. Starting a software company again using the exact same principles.\n\nFirst, start marketing before build. Always. In 2012 I did this and built my email list to over 1,000 people before launch. Launched and was profitable from day one. This took 10mo to accomplish.\n\nIt has been 10mo since I started a blog for my new software company (marketing at the same time as build, which is a few weeks away from being done). Guess what? 10mo of blogging, over 1000 subscribers. Shit just works.\n\nThere is no secret, really. Just do some REAL basic research on themes you want to rank for in your industry and start writing blog posts around these themes. Don't try to game the system, just write blog posts. 1400 words minimum, 3x per week. Easy-peasy.\n\nOn each page of your website, have a sign-up form/call to action for when you launch. This is obviously how people sign-up to your list.\n\n**This methodology works for many reasons, but mainly:**\n\n1. You get early traction. You can run special deals to start recouping costs and making money. Treat these early adopters well and they'll help spread the word.\n2. New customers will come automatically. My site now gets thousands of visitors per month from my blog posts. It feeds itself now in addition to any other marketing endeavors I add (for example, YouTube)\n\nNow, after launch, make sure you communicate often to keep the buzz alive about your product. Announce ever update that you do, share your excitement, and ALWAYS explain how your product makes their life better. Constantly emphasize this. Never stop. People need to be reminded all the time. Oh, and issue refunds promptly if that ever comes up. Easiest way to piss ppl off is to hijack their money.\n\nMost of all, have fun. Don't overthink the process, enjoy the flow of everything, and be flexible as you learn along the way. Listen to customers, and they'll give you their loyalty. Don't hide behind email - use chat. Be accessible. People like to do business with people, not brands.",

                    "comment": "The methodology is based on having built dozens of personal projects over and over again, you accumulate a series of templates and an intuition on how products fit together. Many of us pick up full-stack development including cloud, design and UX best practices and an understanding that business value &gt; development driven decisions. A 2 week functional prototype serves a startup far better than 2 weeks of development towards a 5 year product that doesn't get finished in time to get investment in time, or begin to communicate with users and clients.",

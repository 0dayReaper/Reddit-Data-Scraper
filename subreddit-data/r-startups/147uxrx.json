    "postText": "Hello everyone!  Hope all is well. I am in a situation that has been frustrating me now for the past few weeks. I have been thinking of this idea that I want to work on, and I have been super excited about it ever since. I have even worked out a business plan, with how I can scale it up and everything, funding, revenues models, different kinds of products and services offered, etc. The only problem is, I have zero technical skills and knowledge. And because of this, I am at a standstill with how to take it forward. I have ever tried to read up on some technical content on how the idea can work, but again, its pretty much greek and latin to me after a point.\n\nI tried connecting with a few developers, both online and in person, but again, because I have no idea what it entails, I feel sometimes that they are in it just for the money, since they end up talking about how much it costs and stuff at some point. I really feel I should get a co-founder who feels passionate like how I feel about the idea, and who can help compliment me in getting it off the ground. And I am not sure about learning the skills from scratch, maybe some basics sure to understand what is going on, but not on building up the whole thing by myself.\n\nSo, my question is, how do I, or how does one, go about working on this, given my limitations? I don't want to spend money on a shitty prototype only to create a bad impression with first clients or investors. How do I get in touch with potential co-founders who would be willing to get on this journey together? I feel until I have this in place, my idea is going to be just that, an idea, unfortunately.\n\nYour comments and advises are much appreciated!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nThanks a lot for your comments! Since a few of you were asking about the idea, I thought I'd provide a small summary without getting into too much detail.\n\nIt basically involves, from what I have been told, using computer vision technology. I am looking to create a software or a tool that can identify key events during a video and then automatically split and merge those key events using tags to generate a reel. That's pretty much the whole concept. And I already have plans to expand it into more features and functionalities.\n\nAgain, the tech seems to be a little over the top for me, but if I am able to get help on building it out, I know for a fact I can manage the whole business side of things, since that's my background and my experience.\n\nHope that helped! and Feel free to DM me for any other details as well!",

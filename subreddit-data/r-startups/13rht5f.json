    "postText": "Hi everyone, so recently I've come across the concept of [hair-on-fire](https://youtu.be/QRZ_l7cVzzU?t=632) problems - i.e. pressing problems that need a solution, for which there are early adopters that don't require a perfect solution from the start, and which could be good candidates for building an MVP around.\n\nI think this is a really great concept, but I imagine that unless one is aiming to create the next unicorn company, it will be hard to find generalized, unsolved problems that affect everyone.\n\nI think a lot of these unsolved problems probably exist in niches, and are very industry-specific or lie in the intersection of different industries.\n\nMy question is: do you have any suggestions of ways to systematically find these problems, for someone with not a lot of business knowledge? (I mostly work as a software / data engineer). \n\nOther than being curious and trying to learn about different topics, are there any resources, websites, etc. that address this topic or similar ideas?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHappy to discuss! Thanks!",

Mainly because even considering an algorithmic approach to validating ideas requires the ability to spread bets over a large base early stage, for a founder you are forced to go all in on one hand.\n\nIMO there is really no shortcut for this, you need to get out there, talk to people, find out about their problems, validate solutions. I would recommend finding something close to your heart or that you find really cool, it seems silly, but its a hard slog and your own determination reduces risk of failure moreso than the industry you choose.",

Today I was looking at some startup meetups in my area, and I'm making an effort to start asking people a bit more about their job and the problems they face.\n\nIn terms of finding an industry that is close to my heart, there's nothing that comes to mind really. The main reason why I wanted to start a company is to make more money and hopefully become financially independent. So I am relatively industry agnostic when searching for opportunities...\n\nThanks!",

Technology requires maintenance, innovation, which only costs you more. So only way to run a health care technology company is to have an inflow of customers but gaining traction needs marketing dollars, word of mouth, I think someone who can unlock customer acquisition problem in healthcare will undoubtedly eliminate a major hurdle for companies like us.",

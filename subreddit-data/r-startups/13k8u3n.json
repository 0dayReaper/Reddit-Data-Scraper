    "postText": "I recently joined a startup that has raised several rounds, but is not yet making money and doesn't have a plan for consistent revenue or profit. During the interview process, I was definitely sold on the idea that the company was poised for an acquisition in the not too distant future and that there was a strong user base and path to revenue / profitability.\n\nHowever, I am coming to find that I was sold an overly optimistic vision and that the reality is quite different, especially considering how economic conditions have changed recently, and while we do have a (free) user base, there isn't a clear path to revenue that would sustain the business. Additionally, we were told the most recent raise would last 3-4 years, but it's shaping up to be more like 1.5-2 years, which has me concerned to say the least.\n\nSo it got me to thinking, and I wonder: What red flags do you look out for, especially if you are an engineer, that tell you a startup is more on the path to failure than to success? I'd like to understand if what I am seeing is normal or if they are the alarm bells I think that they are.",

If they can't openly discuss financials or update on company's direction, that's concerning. Also, check if the team has a high turnover rate, that could be a sign of underlying problems that aren't necessarily obvious. Lastly, always trust your gut! If something doesn't feel right, it's worth looking deeper into.",

Is it on me as the primary founder to delegate work at this stage, or am I expecting too much of someone to step up and take things on on their own?",

When he's ready to join, you can bring him on as a co-founder you can give him more. He might be a good person for a board seat at seed stage to keep a balance. \n\nInvestors will balk at you having this dead-weight on your cap table for anything more than 1-2%.",

I\u2019ve done 100% of the market research, wrote a 20 something page BP, built a pitch deck, built a financial/growth model and budget, purchased a domain, had a logo professionally designed, and am currently seeking funding to get the incorporation costs covered and to pay a developer.

If he does, congrats good hire. Either way, it works out. His name equity may be useful in the short term.\n\nThere are plenty of people who do just try to sneak in and get busy doing nothing - the wantrepreneur vibes are common, but more alarmingly, I've run into quite a few successful exit founders who you'd *think* would get the game and make a great partner, but it turns out they have some entitlement or think they can just get by on brand value - sort of the \"my turn to get mine\" MD attitude. I'd say it's 50/50 with successful founders, which i find sad but ymmv.\n\nOn the other hand, you're working on an mvp, it sounds like this guy is in an advisory role for now, and he doesn't have a lot that he either could do, or should be done now.\n\nYou can also vest him as an advisor (with a favorable agreement) with the understanding that a move to full hire is possible",

But not sure what you haven\u2019t said. \n\nI was the primary co-founder of my first startup. I recruited my best friend (an engineer) from all the way back in middle school to join. We had experience running smaller scale \u201chustle businesses\u201d together for many years\u2026 so we are kind of more like brothers. I love him, and I wanted him to be my partner. I knew I would put in the most effort (at least in my own head), we ended up around 58 : 42 split\u2026 it was based on a lot of early things in the first year, I had some money to add, I was the ceo, etc. it worked out, and we are both well off from the exit, but he did admit years later to going through negative feelings at times over being a minority partner comparatively. Then years later after that he admitted he would split another company now the same way, bc he wouldn\u2019t want the job I had. Funny how perspectives shift. \n\nIf the relationship isn\u2019t quite deep, or alternatively you know the persons commitment level really well, I\u2019d be cautious about jumping into co-founder titles.",

    "postText": "I work with several startups doing a mixed bag of things. In some cases, I'm taking a designer role such that I bear the creative burden of keeping pitch decks on-brand as founders, C-suite types, and other members update them.\n\nIn most cases, these updates are done by people without any eye for design and without any familiarity with common design practices like element alignments, matching font sizes between slides, ensuring color uniformity, etc.\n\nI'm looking for the best tool to ensure:\n\nA.) I can implement branding styles like font family and sizing, backgrounds, broad content layout options, and etc.\n\nB.) My style/design implementations require a LOT of effort to circumvent.\n\nC.) Many bonus points for a *very* simplified UX/UI for the people adding content but not customizing things.\n\nPowerPoint ain't *bad* but it offers enough features/options that things get butchered. I usually end up doing things on my end to try and play keep-away, but it doesn't scale well when lots of people have new ideas -- either I'm overloaded OR things get copy-pasted into a Frankenstein copy.\n\nI'm looking at a service like e.g. Pitch.com (never used it) and thinking that might be the solution. Would love to hear any recommendations and/or experiences with similar circumstances and services.",

            "comment": "There are few different options.\n\n1) Figma. I\u2019ve used Figma for designing decks and this is high quality but it takes a lot of effort to customize. The big benefit is that it\u2019ll be free for the most part. They have premium features that are helpful.\n\n2) Canva. I\u2019ve also used Canva and I really like it and recommend it. It\u2019s very intuitive. You can decide on brand elements and then it will be universally implementable across the slides. This is probably the best option for what you\u2019re doing. Canva has a free version but the premium is cheap ($15/month) and very helpful.\n\n3) Google Slides. This is a solid option that\u2019s free. If you haven\u2019t used it, it\u2019s pretty easy to use.\n\nAll of these are good for collaboration as well.\n\nThere are other options but some of the pitch specific services are a little pricey.\n\nI\u2019d be happy walk through it further with you as well.",

                    "comment": "1. Figma - love it for design but it's got too many features for this.\n2. Canva - never really used it beyond a quick templated thing. Does it support enforcing font/color/etc. templates across projects?\n3. Use it a lot, but not good enough for the common case, unfortunately. Generally, there's still too much room for allowing brand-breaking content additions IMO (or my perhaps naive understanding of its features anyway)\n\nPrice is always a *concern* but needs are also a priority. Would love to hear your experience with A.) Canva in this context and/or B.) the other \"pricey\" options you have experience with. Just general thoughts/exp. would be much-appreciated.",

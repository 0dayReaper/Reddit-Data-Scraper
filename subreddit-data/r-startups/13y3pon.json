    "postText": "Me and a couple friends are working on an app to help engineers improve their productivity. We think it's a good idea and have reached out, mostly to friends of friends, to test out the prototype version of the app to see if they like it. What we've found is that for every 5 people we reach out to, about 4 of them won't even try it. Not because they think it's a bad idea, they're just too busy or disinterested to prioritize testing it out over other things.\n\nHow do we get people excited to try out our app? We're not sales people, and I'm not quite sure how to get people pumped about the problem we're trying to solve for them without seeming unnaturally sales-y.",

That's actually the vibe I've been getting when we have been pitching this idea to some people- they acknowledge the pain points but sort of shrug them off, I wonder whether the pain points are small or if people have just resigned to them and don't feel them as much anymore. Sort of like before GPS or smartphones, where it's impossible to go back but it didn't feel so bad at the time.",

Yeh, overnight like, 15 years overnight.\n\nThe vc market doesn't want this. A 5 or 10 year runway would scare the hell out of most investors. And you're spot on. People are blind to problems they didn't think they had or where addressing them leads them to a point they don't want to go to right now. \n\nIf you believe in it then just build and launch. What will happen is you'll be found by one person at first who will be amazed at what they have found and conversation with them will solidify your ideas, then, months later a second. Then people start turning up and demand to know why they didn't know you existed.\n\nBy the time anyone else looks at the market you'll own the generic term for what you do and be years ahead of everyone else who you will watch go through all the steps you did. It's fun to watch.",

It might be a harder time to sell ideas in this area, because the other ones are so exciting, and other engineers might be too busy trying those other ideas (which have social proof) first.",

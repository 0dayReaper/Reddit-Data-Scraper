    "postText": "I\u2019ve seen a ton of posts lately from people asking for help as a non-tech founder, so I figured I\u2019d write this up to help.**Adopt a product mindset.**\n\nMost (technical) people don\u2019t understand how to build a viable product so it\u2019s important to cover.A viable product is built with the customer. It solves their problem without drag. It should be intuitive and it should fit into their life in a convenient way. If you\u2019re lucky, the payoff or value it provides them will keep them coming back.Adopt a product mindset and you will figure out the cheapest, easiest, and most valuable way to build your product.**How do you build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**An MVP can be *anything that provides your potential customer value*. The DoorDash founders created a basic website and a listed Google voice number. The founders would answer the phone calls and make the delivery themselves. No App. Basic website. Solved the problem of food delivery, and most importantly figured out the most streamlined process to support their customers.Get customer input early and often. The most important first step when you don\u2019t have a product is to validate your idea with customer input.*Here\u2019s one way to do that:*\n\nFind someone in the industry to talk to. Schedule a time with them and tell them about your product. Executing an idea is all that matters, you have a vision to execute, most other people don\u2019t.*Here\u2019s another:*\n\n1. Get a domain\n2. Build a basic landing page with an email sign up\n3. Get as much traffic as possible that might like your idea to that landing page (Suggest targeting social media accounts in your industry. If you\u2019re building something in fashion, find fashion-focused accounts)Once people sign up at your landing page, email them and ask them for a meeting to give you input on your idea. I firmly believe that if the product workflow doesn\u2019t already exist, like a simple eCommerce flow, you won\u2019t be able to predict how the customer will want to use the product.It\u2019s best to ask these early potential customers questions about the problem you\u2019re trying to solve. Work with them to understand their challenges, and then you can determine their basic needs.There are a lot of design tools to create a basic mock up. There are also a lot of templates to use to get the right look and feel.After you get customer input, design something simple and lightweight. Share it with your early users (the people whose input you got), and new potential customers as well.\n\n**Iterate. Iterate. Iterate.** Improve the product with user input until you have a good idea about how you will solve your customer\u2019s problem.Now you can consider the tech.\n\n**Edit 1:** I wish I could continue adding to the dialogue here, but I've been permanently banned from the sub. Was just here to help. After 10 years of Reddit, never seen anything like this. \n\nSee you on Discord!\n\n*Looking to appeal the ban, until then, good luck everyone!*",

My company does exactly this for non-tech founders.\nWe had a customer come wanting a full site and platform built thinking they needed to be feature complete before going to market.\nWe advised that we build a basic, branded, landing page with an email waiting list for them that they could then market how they wanted, growing validation of the idea (increased interest in the page and sign-ups) while building the next features.\nThey had far more confidence to invest over time as we were building validated ideas, and used the signed up users as a sounding board for the next priority features.",

            "comment": "i'd like to add on 'product mindset':  \nI like to think of it as a 'no' first mindset.\n\nI used to run an agency, which is a 'yes' mindset. Yes is how you make money - someone asks for something, you say, 'yes' tell them the price, rake in the money.\n\nIn product, saying 'yes' costs you money.\n\nYou have a pie shop, someone comes in and asks for a blue pie, you say 'no, you need to buy the pies we have'. cos saying yes will cost you money to create a blue pie.\n\nIf 100 people come in asking for blue pies then you should probably run the numbers on the viability of blue pies. Who those 100 people are, what segment they are in, will they repeat as customers, are they new customers that will become long term customers, are they current customers who want to use your service more.  \nThen when you have understood what metrics it will effect do a small test and see if you are correct and then invest in the correct amount of blue pie dye.  \n\n\nProduct mindset is to MVP every feature request early on. Once you have money you can take bigger risks or make more mistakes but good discipline is always helpful.  \n\n\nYou of course don't have to wait for customers to come to you with their ideas, you can go to them and put things in front of them and gauge response. But the discipline should be the same",

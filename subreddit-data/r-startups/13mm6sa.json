    "postText": "Finding product market fit\n\nTLDR: determine product requirements early, figure out the return on investment for you customer, price appropriately, make sure you know who the decision makers are and find out what their process is.\n\nIn 2018 I built a company with my mate. He was CEO and I was CTO. I built a Blockchain network with smart contracts to track plastic wasteflows and do a bunch of really smart stuff... But it was all built without any real customer feedback. Dumb. No good business model. Fail within 6 months.\n\nIn 2019 we built another company, again I was CTO and this time we were focusing on the construction industry. \n\nWithin 3 months we had developed a problem statement within my domain of knowledge (construction and concrete), and prototyped the first couple of devices to fit to trucks to gather the data and prove the problem space, as well as a prototype software stack in the cloud in time for demo day.\n\n\nFor demo day we parked a big concrete mixer truck out the front of the venue entrance, my co-founder did a fabulous job of pitching on stage as usual, and I was standing next to the concrete truck after the pitch to chat to potential investors on their way out and show them our system on a real truck. That worked out really well.\n\n\nWe got pre-seed investment and I iterated the design to build another 10-20 units manually on printed circuit boards. I started building product without much real customer requirement solicitation. We had meetings with customers and they confirmed features broadly - but we didn't lock down featureset, price, performance requirements etc.\n\nMy mate the CEO didn't spend much time on product at all, or go to market, or the model - well not in a tangible quantitative way, more qualitative. I ended up preparing most of that documentation in time for investment meetings.\n\nWe got seed investment and started building the company.\n\nI hired a fabulous head of engineering and over the next about 1 year we built the engineering team quite rapidly to redesign the whole system. We applied for and won R&amp;D grants, and built a research team, and my co-founder hired a COO, head of product, head of customer success, and office manager. \n\nWe were burning cash fast, but had build an early system that met our idea of the product requirements.\n\n...news flash, we still had no ducking clue how much the customer would pay and for what. And we were running out of cash so we raised a seed extension.\n\nFast forward another few months and the head of product stepped down for an unrelated reason that I won't explain here (great bloke doing a great job, unfortunate circumstances). It became apparent that I would need to take over product and become CPTO.\n\nI started by inviting our customers to regular \"technical workshops\" to get them to sit with us and tell us what worked and what didn't, what they need and what they don't. We supplied them lunch and made it a bit of fun with a few pints afterwards. This built report and got them talking and using the system. I repeated this with all of our customers and still do it. These people were product users but did not have control of budgets or P&amp;L.\n\n\nI started working directly with customers and pushing for cash. So we got some paid pilots in a couple of geographical regions but most of our installations were free and just gathering data.\n\nSoon my mate and co-founder the CEO stepped out of the business and the COO became managing director while I was busy building product. It became apparent that customers were saying they had no idea what the product was worth to them so they couldn't pay. This was a huge problem. Again we were 6 months from cash zero and no revenue in sight - albeit we had two significant global enterprise clients who like our product.\n\nI decided to start doing commercial development. I started asking the questions, finding the people who make the decisions, and asking them what the process was to get to commercials. We got in some customer accelerators and our users set out clear product requirements. \n\nWe were 6 weeks from running out of cash and the COO stepped down. I became CEO (and CPO, CTO). I immediately sacked the dead weight, and implemented some financial strategies to get a bit of extra cash as well. We managed to get a small investment from existing investors to keep us going, but the investors didn't know me (WTF) and were very hesitant. \n\n\nI closed 3 small deals, 1 with an SME and two with global enterprises. Not worth much in cash, but a good start. I communicated regularly with the shareholders.\n\n\nI built up a business case spreadsheet (ROI) for each feature for my customers, got them to review it and get onboard, then revised the pricing and packaging of features to suit their needs.\n\n\nWe smashed the accelerator requirements and were the favourite in the accelerator. The global csuite of that company were (and is) all over us.\n\n\nContracts are finally coming in, I've promoted the head of engineering to CTO, and we'll hit \u00a31m ARR this year, and raise series A.\n\n\nThings are really moving now, it's incredible, and I think the most important thing is to communicate honestly, openly, collaboratively with customers... And know who to speak to about what. The user probably isn't the person that will make the decision in the end.\n\n\n\nI think we have PMF now finally, based on commercial demand for our product at its current price.",

It seems like you\u2019ve done an epic job getting your startup to where it is now.  \nIf there\u2019s one thing to take away from your experiences, it's that understanding your customer's needs is absolutely key. I love how you initiated technical workshops, and made them fun and engaging. This not only built a rapport with your customers but also gave you valuable insights into what they really needed.  \nYour experience also underlines the importance of knowing who the decision-makers are. The users of a product aren't always the ones holding the purse strings. So, getting to know who makes those crucial buying decisions is super important.  \nKudos on your pivot to CEO, that's a big shift! And your resilience in the face of financial pressure is commendable.  \nYour journey has a lot of great lessons for other entrepreneurs. I reckon the [Open Source CEO newsletter](https://open-source-ceo.beehiiv.com/) would love your insights. It's a newsletter that shares the experiences of founders like yourself, and I bet they'd be interested in your story.  \nAnyway, keep riding the wave! Here's to hitting that \u00a31m ARR and beyond.",

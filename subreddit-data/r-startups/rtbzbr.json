I get the gist, but I would be more specific. \n\nDesign wide the website and branding doesn\u2019t feel super local. If that\u2019s your USP I think it could be pushed further. \n\nShow images of bee farmers and the keepers. Make the branding feel more organic, maybe that \u201crepurposed\u201d rural look. \n\nThe cartoon bee is a bit of a disconnect from the tone of your messaging. \n\nIt\u2019s at least nice and clean and professional looking. A great start. But if you\u2019re looking to level up I see a lot of room for improvement.",

I came up with this idea when I would often got fake proof of funds letters from \"buyers\" for investment properties I was listing for sale.  How it Works: The buyer creates an account and the platform pings their bank and/or brokerage account(s) to see if the buyer indeed has the requisite cash/liquid assets for the transaction.  The buyer can either share that they, A. have the minimum amount of cash/liquid assets on hand for the transaction or B. show the total value of all their linked accounts.  None of the buyers sensitive bank or personal info (account numbers, etc) is shared with us or the requesting party, only the values of the linked account(s) is shared.  \nWhat life cycle stage is your startup at:  \nDiscovery (prototype)  \nWhat goals are you trying to reach this month:  \nGet test users for site\n\nHow can r/startups helps?:\n\n\r\n\nI am looking for test users for our current alpha site, preferably folks with real estate experience (real estate agents/brokers, wholesalers, investors).  Would be willing to pay for a 20 minute interview via Zoom!",

Other extensions like Honey or Pouch have the same testing behaviour. Ofcourse there is a limit to the amount of coupons being tested, and the future goal is to have it decentralised, meaning that if user 1 tests coupon x as not working, then user 2 wont try that coupon aswell :)   \nHope that clarifies!",

How will you make money if there are no ads, no selling of user data, and no pay-to-use model?\n2. With the core value of Freedom of Speech and a community-based flagging and censoring model, how would you prevent any one particular group to become the stronghold of control and therefore creating a one-sided (or possibly even hate speech-driven/tolerant) platform? Unless I'm missing something, the model assumes that there will be equal community representation on the platform to self-monitor, however, the reality will probably be that there will be a vast majority of like-minded people who will dictate the content allowed on the platform and effectively cancel out anyone who tries posting content against their ideology. Curious to know your thoughts.\n3. With other platforms already in existence as a facebook-alternative without selling your data and less ad-driven, what's the unique value prop that your platform will have that these others don't?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Facebook comments, Tweets, YouTube comments, what comes to your mind when you think about these?\n\nBut what if things were different? What if they were better, and you have a place where you can be heard, where people listen to what you want to say, and you come away from every conversation knowing more.\n\nThe meaning of our company's name, **Ugeddit, is a feeling**, of being heard.\n\nMany social media platforms were built to chat quickly, not helpfully, and they disregard safety, ignore mental health, and promote hate just to get more ad revenue.\n\nOn Ugeddit, our chat communities platform helps you have fewer misunderstandings and more meaningful conversations by sharing your intentions clearly. Doing this means people are more likely to understand what you really mean, preventing conflict, and building trust.\n\nOur first mission is helping 100 people understand each other better online.\n\n## Our status\n\n- MVP launched\n- Validating product &amp; implementing advice via [alpha testing](https://ugeddit.notion.site/Ugeddit-Alpha-Testing-Early-Access-b08c80ecd0bd473181876f3b0564151e)\n- I, as the founder &amp; CEO, am currently fulfilling the roles of\n   - Lead full stack developer\n   - Project &amp; product manager\n   - Social media marketing\n   - User experience researcher\n   - User experience designer\n   - And others as needed\n\n## Our current goals for January 2022 are\n\n- Onboarding at least 10 alpha testers each for iOS and Android\n- Establish contact with 5 potential sources for funding (lean business plan + projections are ready)\n- Reach out to at least 10 people to find 1 highly experienced [full stack developer](https://ugeddit.notion.site/Senior-Full-Stack-Developer-ddee376aadae4c2fa7d1f8bc603ba801)\n\n## Special bonuses you can get are\n\n- Being on our contributors list means rewards for you down the line; more points = more reward\n- Sharing Ugeddit on social channels with a meaningful message about why you want Ugeddit to succeed and/or what you're excited for\n   - **+5 contributor points** for sharing on 1 platform (reddit, FB, Twitter, Discord, etc; max 1/day/platform)\n      - e.g. sharing on reddit and Twitter 1x/day = 10pts/day, 5x/day = 10pts/day\n      - e.g. sharing on reddit, Twitter, Discord, and FB 1x/day = 20pts/day\n   - **+3 contributor points** per meaningful comment/reply (Beyond just emoticons or generic words, meaning Human thoughts; can stack multiple times for each person)\n      - e.g. 10 comments of \":D :D :D :D\", \":o :o :o wow\", etc = 0pts\n      - e.g. 2 comments of \"This is actually an amazing idea\", \"Dude we need this so bad because...\" = 6 pts\n      - Tip: questions like \"What do you think about this?\", \"I'm curious what you all think\", \"What would be the best thing Ugeddit can do?\", etc influence people to think and write meaningful comments\n   - Copy the links to your post(s) as they're needed to verify &amp; claim points\n- **25 contributor points** for joining our alpha testers\n   - **+10 contributor points** for each additional piece of interaction-based advice you share that is aligned with our values\n- **500 contributor points** for successfully referring an experienced full stack developer who aligns with our vision and has the skills that we decide to bring onto the team\n- **1000 contributor points** for successfully referring someone experienced in fundraising for social impact who helps us secure any nonrestrictive grant, investment, or other ethical funding aligned with our values\n\n## Vision\n\nIt's my vision that once everyone on this planet understands each other, and I mean really understands each other, then all of us will work together earnestly so that our combined efforts focus on the biggest problems in the world today, and we will solve them, permanently... bringing us one step closer to an incredible future.",

You can write something amazing and helpful, but without backlinks you'll struggle to rank. \n\nWe solve this by:\n\n1. Discovering all the sites that currently rank for the keywords you would like to rank for.\n\n2. Tracking those domains, so that if they expire in the future you can register them yourself and get those backlinks.\n\nThis process is very \"white hat\" from an SEO perspective (it's no different than buying a competitor's site) takes minimal time compared to emailing thousands of sites and begging for links and our early users have seen some big wins as each site you pick up carries over dozens or hundreds of backlinks. \n\nAs a data point, a professional search marketing agency typically charges hundreds of dollars per high quality backlink.\n\n* **Lifecycle Stage:** Very early. I've had the core of this working for a couple of months now with a handful of beta users and I'm planning on launching for real this month. \n\n* **How could r/startups help?** I'd like to give demos to a few more people as we get closer to launch.

Our aim is to democratize the powerful resources traditionally made available only to financial advisors.\n\n**Why did you make this?**  \nPeople need serious financial planning tools. The internet is giving people more power than ever to take control of their personal finances. Unfortunately, many popular retirement calculators on the web today have major shortcomings. And we expect a lot of folks don\u2019t realize how ill-suited some of these tools are for long-term planning.\n\n**Our Free MVP**  \nTo start, we\u2019ve built a portfolio/retirement model with professional-grade simulation capabilities, and it\u2019s 100% free to use.\n\n**Why is it free?**   \nHow do you make money? We\u2019re a startup; we don't make money, but we're great at spending it. We're trying to attract early adopters to build a brand and encourage feedback.\n\n**Why do I need an account?**  \nWe\u2019re scaling this on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the computational requirements are extensive. With monthly compounding and 10,000 trials, the simulation engine requires tens of millions of calculations and random variables for every run. Until we know exactly how much it's going to cost to keep everything running in the cloud, we need to filter for bot traffic and other tomfoolery.\n\n**What do you want from users?**  \nYour feedback; we want to make the best tool(s) possible. In order to do that, we need to know what you like, what you don\u2019t like, and what other features you\u2019d like to see.",

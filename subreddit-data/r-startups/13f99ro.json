    "postText": "So my co-founder and I are currently trying to validate our startup concept. It really is a concept, the technology isn't really anything someone with some web development experience couldn't replicate in a weekend, I mean I've asked Chat gpt to write the basics and it nailed it. We used a different technology, but it still could be done faster in a pure Web Stack (IMO). \n\nAnyways, with that said, the technology is not the product: The concept, the belief, and the idea that we could make something better, and create change, that's the product. The monetary product would be data we can gather/generate to drive that change, but we aren't actually doing that yet. \n\nSo does this sort of thing have any legs?\n\nWe feel like we shouldn't work more on the code side of things if we can't get anyone to use it. But maybe if we were delivering the actual value (the data), people would use it?",

So charge people as early as possible, if you can't change people then you don't really have MVP cos it is not a 'product'.\n\nCall your pricing 'introductory' pricing so you can change it easily. If no one complains about your price then keep putting it up until they do and then probably put it up some more.",

Otherwise, your employer will end up owning your idea.\n\nA VC isn't going to invest in an idea that anyone can replicate unless the team promoting that idea is so amazing that its the team that will be the selling point.\n\nLearn more about how to secure your rights before you go any further.\n\nDo this search in your web browser:\n\n\"What to do if you have a great startup idea How to protect your rights\"\n\nand filter the results by the past year.\n\nBut don't get too worried about patents, copyrights, etc. Those articles are likely trying to sell you a service. Look for the pieces written by other founders who have been where you are.\n\nYou might try narrowing your search by using the site function. \n\ne.g., What to do if you have a great startup idea How to protect your rights site:Reddit.com\n\nor site:IndieHackers",

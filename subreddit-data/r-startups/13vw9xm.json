    "postText": "Curious to hear about your experience with Brex, both positive and negative. \n\nI like what they offer but I never heard back when I tried to connect with sales online. I was able to get one account opened through a partner which they then tried to rush me into transacting with. Now I\u2019m trying to open another account and haven\u2019t been able to get into contact with anyone there for over a week even though they stayed 48h turnaround. Curious if others have similar experiences?",

I was too embarrassed to try to explain to my customer's account payable department that I was using a fake bank, so I just opened a Chase account up, which was quicker and easier than the Brex account, and gave them the new numbers.",

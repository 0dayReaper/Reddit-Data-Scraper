Since you are the owner of the product, while developing it, who do you always feel is the best fit for starters? Your MVP is best put in the hands of the most suitable company with a reference to the key features of your website. Alternatively, you can save on time by creating a virtual company and having someone else try to automate its business model with the tool you are developing.",

Keeping track of stock is mostly built into most of the e-commerce sites including data entry and lead capture and support. I am not trying to discourage you, but I need you to see the essence of ealry research regarding your target audience and being so specific because your early adaptors either kill the tool or make it a hit. It is not about you. Based on your response, it seems you guys did not ask around to determine the viability of your product. So, to correct that mistake, get an experienced user researcher to come in and evaluate your tool and the features and get you a solution. Moreover, you can do the research on your own until you find the most suitable match.",

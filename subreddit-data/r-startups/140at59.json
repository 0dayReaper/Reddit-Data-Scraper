You know startups change quickly and it's really hard to figure these things out in the beginning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd the problem with waiting to get a cofounder onboard at a later stage is that where is the \"founding\" part? Will that cofounder feel that he owns the company and the idea as much as me? Will I hire an expereineced employee with equity or a cofounder?",

Are you dearly missing in some skillset? How much time will it take you to learn that? Can you easily find cofounder which would fill the role?  \n\n\nHaving 2 founders is risky, usually does not solve the missing skill problem so you will need to learn a lot either way. In theory more work can be done when there are 2, especially if that person can completely take from your back something you would otherwise struggle with.",

It's okay to wait until you know what you need and find someone with the right skills and you can have a highly productive working relationship. You may not even need a cofounder at all vs. early employees.\n\nWhen you find the right employees, you can structure the equity stake in a way that is not equal to yours and is on the standard 4/1 vesting schedule.",

I did want a technical cofounder since I'm stronger on the product/business side but after three failed attempts of vetting potential founders I proceeded solo. I ended up hiring employee developers and paid them close to market rate + options. They ended up building whatever we needed technologically but none of them sharing the weight of responsibility that a founder carries. \n\nI don't think it's possible to add a cofounder after you raise the first round of funding but you can hire people that can develop into very valuable close allies that feel similar to cofounders.",

It allows you to validate your idea, build a foundation, and gain traction before bringing on a co-founder. However, it's important to consider the long-term implications and compatibility with potential co-founders. Ensure clear communication, shared values, and complementary skills to establish a successful partnership when the time comes.",

            "comment": "Folks that start with the company are founders. Founders are typically compensated with less cash and more equity (often, an even split).\n\nIf you bring someone aboard later and haven't yet established the business, there's a good chance they'll want a founder's share of equity, regardless of how much time and effort you've contributed solo since inception. If you have a going concern already, you can hire them as employees, pay them with operating cash flow, and keep your equity.\n\nEssentially, there is no benefit to bringing in a cofounder at a later date. They're either a critical founder and worth the time and equity today or they're an employee and you should wait to hire until you can afford it.",

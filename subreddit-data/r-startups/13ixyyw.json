What qualities or skills do you look for when hiring your first employees, and how do you ensure they are aligned with your company's vision and culture? Are there any specific interview techniques or strategies you have found effective in assessing these aspects during the hiring process?",

These are the people who will be laying the groundwork for your company, so they need to feel a sense of responsibility towards the business. A good way to assess this is by asking about their past experiences - when have they taken initiative or gone above and beyond what was expected of them? This can give you insight into their level of drive and commitment.",

It is just a mechanism to try to get people in for less.  People understand it, so it means nothing.  People that talk about culture, mission, and vision too much are unrealistic regarding people.  You want people that will work hard.  That means motivation, which is money.  Focus on the creation of customer value.\n\nHire quickly, test so,done out, and fire them quickly if they are the wrong person.  The answer to finding people isn\u2019t more beaucracy.",

You won't have time to test someone out for long given your funding runway so hire using your gut/research, and test quickly so you can fire and fix asap if need be. No silver bullet to ensure you get the right person - it's as much art and science as luck.",

So I\u2019ve given a speech about this very topic at a top tier university. \n\nIn a nutshell, find a cofounder that don\u2019t duplicate your skills but compliment your whole project. Good practice here is you can create a list of skills you have and skills you need. That\u2019s the cofounder you should be looking to attract, one that has the skills you need. \n\nHope this helps, happy to discuss more.",

All it takes is one asshole to make all the other employees lives miserable.\n\nIt\u2019s the most important test by far.  \n\nHave a good bullshiter / yes person type test.  Don\u2019t hire people who just agree with you.\n\nObviously look for talent and intelligence, but not at the expense  of the ability to work with others well.\n\nYou usually want a somewhat relaxed culture where people aren\u2019t afraid to speak their mind.  If they are then the companies got culture issues.",

If you're not familiar with Shackleton, I would suggest reading up on him.  He was one of the first to explore Antarctica and managed to survive 8 months stranded with no one on his team dying.\n\nThe legend is that he managed to attract and filter out quality candidates through a simple ad that read:\n\n*Men wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in event of success.*",

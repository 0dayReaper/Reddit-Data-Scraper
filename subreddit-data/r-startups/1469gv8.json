    "postText": "I've built an MVP and will be reaching out to clients within 3 days however I'm worried about signing contracts with my own name. I want to make an LLC to sign contracts with but I cannot afford it (yes I know it's only $100 to $300), and so I'm planning on signing contracts under my own name and then moving them to an LLC in about a month or so after making money from clients. \n\nI'm just worried about being liable even after forming the LLC for the contracts I will sign before forming it. These will be long term partnership sorts of contracts. One option I'm considering is writing the contract for only 1 month then when I make the LLC, redo the contracts after they expire for longer terms. \n\nI want to ask people for money for my idea, but I don't want to owe them anything other then the loan + interest, however my credit is so shit I couldn't get an actual loan.\n\nDoes anyone know if it's fine to sign contracts under my own name and then move them to an LLC later and remove any liability that could have come from initially signing under my own name? \n\n\nOr does anyone know how I could get funds (like $500 to $1000) without having to owe anyone anything more then the loan + interest (with bad credit)?",

            "comment": "It is possible to sign contracts under your own name and then transfer them to an LLC later, but it's important to do so carefully in order to limit potential liability. When you form an LLC, the business becomes its own legal entity separate from you as an individual, which means that any liabilities related to the business will belong to the LLC rather than you personally.\n\nHowever, if you signed contracts with clients before forming the LLC and something went wrong - for example, if there was a breach of contract or other legal issue - you could still be held liable even after forming the LLC. This is because when you signed those original contracts as an individual, you were acting on behalf of yourself rather than a separate legal entity like an LLC.\n\nOne option would be to include language in your initial contracts specifying that they are subject to assignment or transfer at a later date. This can help protect against liability issues by making it clear that any obligations or liabilities associated with those contracts will ultimately be transferred over to the new entity (i.e., your newly-formed LLC). However this may require obtaining consent from all parties involved.\n\nAs for getting funding without owing anyone anything more than what was borrowed plus interest- One idea could be looking into peer-to-peer lending platforms such as LendingClub or Prosper where individuals can lend money directly without involving traditional banks. Another option might be seeking out grants from non-profit organizations relevant within industry \n\nIt's always advisable though  consulting with a lawyer who specializes in business law before signing any legally binding documents , transferring ownership etc .",

They might view it as a donation but you should view it as a loan.",

            "comment": "This sounds like a terrible idea. Contracts are contracts. They remain the original contract unless there's an agreed-upon modification, so you'd basically have to have an agreement to redo them, but they'd really wonder why you need that just a month later. \n\nHonestly, borrow the money and get it done right or wait until you have $300. You don't want to be personally liable if something goes wrong.",

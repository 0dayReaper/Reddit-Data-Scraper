    "postText": "I've seen it come up quite often on this sub where people ask on how/where to get a startup idea, as they want to work on smth of their own but lack inspiration.\n\nI'm on the opposite side, where I seem to have an infinite supply of ideas. I have worked in tech (business analysis, product management) for quite a while and delivered solutions for my clients or employers, so I know it's not random and I can deliver value.\n\nThe plan is to eventually launch smth of my own and I have come close to it, but abandoned either due to health reasons or investors pulling out.  \n\nIs there a market for this and if so, how would that work? Not looking for co-founding atm, as I need to take care of my health and some personal stuff first.",

People who haven\u2019t built a company around an idea and then reached a milestone like $1M ARR always think ideas are more valuable than they actually are. Execution is 90%,  even a truly original and novel idea that has unique market value is maybe 10%.",

It can surely be valuable if that's the only thing stopping someone from getting out of a miserable place of being stuck at a job they don't like... but I'm not here to argue about that\n\nI see people who are looking for it and just wondering if there's a market and a procedure around it. It's not for me to decide if they want to pursue an idea that isn't theirs.",

Anything from you bringing on equity partners (paid or unpaid) to x \u00a3m offers depending on the IP and/or potential. \n\nThe value will be directly relative to the amount of risk you leave the buyer with and their appetite for it.",

So I think there\u2019s something to be said for the fact that if you don\u2019t have ideas, starting a company might not be for you\n\nAlso, it really helps if the ideas come from your own experience, because that gives you a big advantage. So selling ideas might not actually work out well for the buyer",

It's something I'm exploring currently given that health constraints don't allow me to pursue launching these products on my own...\n\nand idk if they're so bad, considering that I've gotten paid for doing it for the last 10 years, the difference being that it came together with delivering the actual products as part of delivery teams, but now I am just by myself\n\nIf you don't have good advice to offer, I'd suggest this crazy idea of maybe not commenting at all.",

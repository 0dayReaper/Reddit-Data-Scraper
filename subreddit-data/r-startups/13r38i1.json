    "postText": "My latest employment, a contract role, ended in December and it\u2019s been tough finding something. I\u2019ve pretty much expanded every aspect of my search and applied to a role at a startup last week.\n\nIt\u2019s a non technical role that my experience matches. I had my first call with them yesterday and the interview process was explained and it included 2 additional 30 minute calls, a take home assignment that would take 2 hours to do, and finally a 15 minute call with the CEO. Today I got a note that they wanted to skip every part of the process and go straight to a 20 minute call with the CEO.\n\nI hate processes that are too strict as much the next guy, but this seems bonkers to me.\n\nFrom what I gathered, this hire would be about the 25th employee. Is this normal, or a red flag?\n\n10 YOE\n~$150k + unknown amount equity, no 401k (coming soon, supposedly)",

We passed it around and laughed, until we realized people think these matter. These are job hoppers that haven\u2019t been anywhere longer than 18 months for years, they have serious personal problems with divorces, lawsuits etc. we made a huge mistake hiring them, but if you took their Glassdoor reviews seriously, you\u2019d have zero valid info about the company.

You got a double thumbs up on the screen and they probably just want a final gut check from the CEO because the market is shit and they need someone. Seems like a bit of a red flag if you are getting fast tracked from a recruiter screen to a CEO interview, but not because they don\u2019t want to hire you. I don\u2019t know the exact nature of the role so without additional context it\u2019s hard to say, but you might need to ask for more interviews because you need to learn more about the role, who you are working with, how they operate etc. could be bad news.\n\nNot every gig is worth taking, money be damned.",

(aka LinkedIn + portfolio online).\n\nIf so.., I could easily see skipping all the BS of the hiring process and speaking with you directly.\n\nI say this as a Founder of a saas company.... you have 10 YOE. In my view, if your answer is yes to my first question, then it's a no brainer. My view is \"Let's hop on the phone 1:1 and dive into it. I don't want to waste your time and I need to hire talent.\"Companies with VC backing are under pressure to grow, and there is a lot of talent on the market at the moment. If you are top talent, I wouldn't want to waste a second of your time going through some BS interview process that you're clearly competent enough to exceed based on past success.\n\nNow the reaction many may have is... \"why have an interview process at all if you are going to bypass it?\". And the reason is it's to weed out those who might could/maybe/potentially be a decent enough fit. It isn't to shut the doors on clearly strong talent and make them go through hoops.\n\nTo use an out-of-touch analogy... everyone has to wait in line to get into a busy club, including very attractive girls and well off guys. Except super models and athletes. They cut to the front of the line.  \n\n\nEdit: It could be everything I said above. OR their interviewing/recruiting process is shit and they haven't really built a strong pipeline to attract/hire top talent and close the deal in getting needed hires. Maybe the CEO is needing to work through that behind the scenes but doesn't want to flag to his/her team that he/she views them as incompetent. My point is, there are several reasons this could be legitimate. Does the CEO seem like a legit person based on their LinkedIn profile?",

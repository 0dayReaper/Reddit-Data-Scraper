They're saying it's either totally messed up right now or about to get worse. So, I gotta ask: How bad is it really?

VCs will put their $ into less risky things, and boards will ask to see a path to profitability and/or a real business model sooner.  \n\nStartups that didn't have that trajectory and were planning to coast entirely on VC until some nebulous acquisition appears are going to get squashed.  Startups with good business fundamentals and/or have a path to good fundamentals will keep going fine.",

It started dipping last February then picked up again in May and fell off a cliff in Q4. It's been very quiet since. I reach out to founder friends weekly and they're all trying to stay optimistic, but acknowledge that capital, at least on reasonable terms, is not available and funding for anything not related to AI or in a post B follow-on round with amazing metrics simply isn't getting funding. \n\nPersonally, I don't think typical SAFE seeds are at risk. We'll probably still see the smaller gambles, but the majority of Seed and Series A companies are definitely struggling to raise right now without amazing metrics.",

Uber, AirBNB, Lyft, etc etc etc. They have no fundamentals financially. They just used boatloads of cheap, borrowed money to be loss leaders on everything to put existing businesses or industries out of business before they turned off the free cash and gouged consumers revealing themselves as the predators they always were. \n\nIf interest rates stay high you're going to need to have a really great business with really great fundamentals to get investment.

Most of the intros we get these days are through existing client referrals but it takes time to orchestrate it that way. Go niche and carve a name. \ud83d\ude4c",

The financial and economic reasons that others in the thread are talking about are having a real and palpable effect on those employees who are still working. Optimism has been replaced by fear, and everyone has their head down. \n\nSome general observations:\n\n1) Many working at growth stage startups are reconsidering startup life now. Engineers/developers are fleeing to the safety and security of working at financial institutions.  Some might call it a stuffy and corporate environment, but it pays well, communication and processes are robust, and there might even be a defined benefits pension plan waiting for you at the end of the day if you're lucky.\n\n2) Full time remote work was fun while it lasted, but its days are numbered. The momentum is clearly on the side of co-location, or a hybrid model that heavily favours more time in the office. Employees who were enjoying the \"pay raise\" by not spending $ on public transportation/gas/parking will have to go back to biting the bullet. \n\n3) Founders should be working 10x harder to keep the people they have in this environment. Just as the cost of keeping a customer is lower than the cost of acquiring a new one, so it is with your team. If you typically don't do town halls or provide regular financial updates, START TODAY. The lack of frequent and honest news will signal to everyone that you're in trouble and afraid to disclose it. This is a culture killer. \n\nMake sure that you have the best people around you now for when the wind changes direction. \n\nFinally, there is a lot of great talent looking for work right now who would otherwise be unavailable. Even if you've decided to pause hiring for a while, keep an eye out and be prepared to pounce. When things get better (which it will), your team should be primed and ready to go, not be in the process of rebuilding.",

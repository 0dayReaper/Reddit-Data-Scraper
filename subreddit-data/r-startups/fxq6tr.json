    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI was looking for an inspiration for myself and compiled this list. I was coming across to popular examples like Uber and Airbnb, so I dived deeper into the growth hacking ocean to put something different on the table.\n\nI included both popular and unpopular hacks to the list to inspire you, so here I go.\n\n**1. Puma**\n\nPuma asked Pele to tie his shoes before the kickoff and Pele did it. As expected, the cameras focused on Pele and his Puma's and made people realize the world's best footballer wore a Puma.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/results?search\\_query=pele+tie+shoes](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pele+tie+shoes)\n\nAccording to the book \u201cThree Stripes Versus Puma\u201d, Pele was paid $120,000 to crouch and lace his shoes. This might be the best case of influencer marketing until this day.\n\n**Takeaway:** Ask yourself who, when, where.\n\nWho can introduce your product to your target audience best? When is the right time and which online or offline platform can you use to get maximum exposure?\n\n**2. Unsplash**\n\nUnsplash has a corner named \u201cCollections\". They ask influencers (mostly micro-influencers) and invite them to pick their favorite photos and create a collection.\n\nThen Unsplash promotes the collection on the website, newsletter and social media platforms. Flattering right? Yes, at least that\u2019s what the influencers think.\n\nThe chosen influencers will often share their collections with their followers. And Unsplash gets free exposure + tons of user-generated content.\n\n**Takeaway:** People like to be praised and be the center of attention. You can benefit from other people's audiences.\n\n**3**. **Vitaly Uncensored**\n\nThis is quite unconventional and it's dangerous.\n\nVitaly Uncensored is a strange adult jokes platform. And people barely knew they existed until the Champions League final in 2019.\n\nUntil Kinsey Wolanski (co-founder and girlfriend of Vitaly) caused an international stir after running on to the pitch with a swimsuit written \"Vitaly Uncensored\" all over.\n\nNaturally, people searched for the term and social media platforms like twitter flooded with reactions.\n\nVitaly Uncensored now has more than 32 million registered users and has raked in up to \u00a33m in advertising as a result. And she was fined just \u00a313,000.\n\n**Takeaway:** A Growth hacker doesn't always follow the rules. You can sometimes break them as long as it is bringing you growth.\n\n**4. Ahrefs**\n\nAhrefs can win the gold medal in the growth hacking Olympics.\n\nThey're the most popular SEO tool and don't use Google Analytics. Neither do they use the Facebook Pixel. Instead, they hacked the most prominent SEO conference (Brighton SEO) with a 10 cent coffee cup.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/VvlP1Xo](https://imgur.com/a/VvlP1Xo)\n\nImagine how much attraction they had at the conference. Everybody was instantly aware of the existence of Ahrefs; those cups worked as an ice-breaker to open new conversations and possibilities.\n\n**Takeaway:** Make a list of conferences and offline events that you can join. And think of how you can direct the conversation to your brand.\n\n**5. Gmail**\n\nIf you were an early adopter of Gmail, you'd remember this one. You could only create a Gmail account if a friend invited you.\n\nAnd every referrer had a limited amount of invites, which made it more exclusive and triggered the fear of missing out (FOMO) marketing technique.\n\nIt was simultaneously so exclusive and so viral, some people auctioned Gmail invites on eBay. It worked well because Gmail was offering better features and quality of service compared to the alternatives in the market.\n\n**Takeaway:** Knowing behavioral psychology is a great asset for a growth hacker. Even a little psychological trick can be the foundation of a new growth hacking strategy.\n\n**6. Please don't tell**\n\nGmail used exclusivity and FOMO triggers in their digital marketing strategy. What if you want to do it offline?\n\nCrif Dogs is a hip place known for its innovative hot dogs. There is a strange vintage phone booth corner in the restaurant.\n\nOne day, a person walked in and used the rotary dial phone and CLICK, a secret passage door opened to a cozy bar. And the bartender treated him with a tasty cocktail and gave a card to this lucky person on the card written: \"Please Don't Tell\".\n\nAs you may relate, that person has felt like he discovered the most astounding secret in the world. He then talked about this experience to all of his friends and it caused a social chain reaction.\n\nThis word-of-mouth marketing strategy transformed this place into the busiest bar in New York City. So busy it's almost impossible to make a reservation.\n\n**Takeaway:** If you can make someone feel special with a big secret, you can create a community of privileged brand advocates.\n\n**7. Zynga**\n\nYou must remember the era of FarmVille, MafiaWars or Zynga poker. These were the Facebook games that made addicts out of our friends, parents and loved ones.\n\nHow?\n\nYou know the classic pricing decoy: Small $3, medium $ 6.50 and large $7.\n\nZynga re-engineered this by offering three choices to the user: grind, spam or pay. Well, since people didn't want to pay to continue playing games, they started to terrorize their friends by spamming them with invitations.\n\nThis had a huge viral effect but after a while, Facebook put an end to this spamstorm.\n\n**Takeaway:** Try to approach popular marketing tactics from a different angle to create your own growth strategies.\n\n**8. CD Baby**\n\n\"Your order is on the way\" you probably have received an email similar to this one. But I don't think you ever received something like what Derek Sivers wrote:\n\n*Your CDs have been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with sterilized contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow.*\n\n*A team of 50 employees inspected your CDs and polished them to make sure they were in the best possible condition before mailing.*\n\n*Our packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over the crowd as he put your CDs into the finest gold-lined box that money can buy.*\n\n*We all had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole party marched down the street to the post office where the entire town of Portland waved \u2018Bon Voyage!\u2019 to your package, on its way to you, in our private CD Baby jet on this day, Sunday, December 11th.*\n\n*I hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby. We sure did.*\n\n*Your picture is on our wall as \u201cCustomer of the Year\u201d. We\u2019re all exhausted but can\u2019t wait for you to come back to CDBABY.COM!!*\n\n*Thank you once again,*\n\n*Derek Sivers, president, CD Baby*\n\nHe spent 20 minutes writing this masterpiece and it exploded on the internet. This content got forwarded thousands of times, CD Baby got gazillions backlinks and new customers.\n\n**Takeaway:** Differentiate your e-mail marketing strategy or copywriting efforts. Sometimes it is as easy as to put a smile on your customers' faces.\n\n9. **Tiger King**\n\nThe Tiger King docuseries on Netflix have reached super-hyped status. One of the protagonists is called Joe Exotic, he is a sympathetic asshole. But I was not aware that he's a badass growth hacker too.\n\nJoe Exotic intimidated his archenemy and biggest competitor by renaming his tiger show.\n\nJust to add context if you don't know the show.\n\nJoe Exotic keeps more than 200 tigers in his wildlife park. On the other hand, there is that lady (Carole Baskin) who is catter than cats and trying to save tigers under the banner of Big Cat Rescue. And they're trying to sabotage each other, all the time.\n\nSo to get more visibility to his tiger show and steal Carole's audience, Joe Exotic started a new show under the name\"Big Cat Rescue Entertainment\".\n\nIn the end, Carole sued Joe in a $1M lawsuit.\n\nNow, this obviously is not ethical and can hurt your reputation, I'm not suggesting you do the same. But this case can inspire you to be creative with your brand name. It could be interesting to include terms that people are already searching for.\n\n10. **Fortnite**\n\nFortnite\u2019s growth hacking strategy has changed the way of marketing around games forever.\n\nHere is the default strategy of every game until the Fornite era.\n\n1. Make the game.\n2. Spend millions of dollars to promote it like crazy in conferences and ads of all sorts.\n3. Launch the game, do the grand slam, collect the money and sail for the next game.\n\nThat's why we see a new Call of Duty, Battlefield, Fifa and similar games each year.\n\nWell, Fortnite was not even popular in its first year but they found ways to retain their existing customer base with three tactics.\n\n1. The game was completely free.\n2. Huge in-game updates, which they called \"Seasons\".\n\nEvery ten weeks, developers brought new mechanics, weapons, maps, characters and so on into the game. They announce these seasons with trailers and encourage gamers to create hype.\n\nSo if you're a Fortnite player, you'll know, every ten weeks you'll have a new game to play.\n\n1. Limited-time game mods\n\nThey regularly launched new game modes for a limited time to create FOMO. And gamers kept coming back to not to miss this one-time experience.\n\nMeanwhile, they monetized the game by selling in-game items like character and weapon skins or dance moves.\n\nIn a very short time, they acquired a huge fan base and created their own celebrity streamers. The rest is history.\n\n**Takeaway:** Acquisition is often an overrated aspect of marketing. In growth marketing, it's equally important to keep your current customers happy and transform them into your fans. (Focus on retention)\n\n11. **Crimibox**\n\nCrimibox is an online interactive detective game that lets you become a Sherlock of your case. We prepared a FB chatbot quiz themed \"Which detective is hidden inside\".\n\nThe assumption: If they are interested in knowing which kind of detective they are, they are potentially also interested in solving a murder case.\n\nCrimibox asked several questions in a chatbot and helped them find out their inner detective. At the end of the quiz, they offer them to solve a murder case and direct them to the crime scene. This scene was Kickstarter.\n\nCrimibox increased its subscriber number from 2K to 10K in 15 days and successfully launched on Kickstarter!\n\nWhy did it work?\n\n1. It was super targeted.\n2. People always fall for personality quizzes\n\n**12. Shazam**\n\nWhat do you do when you Shazam a song?\n\nYou try to suck up all sound from the music and Shazam does something quite ingenious at that moment. It encourages you to hold your phone up to speakers.\n\nAnd this move gets everyone curious like \"Why the hell is she lifting her phone to the speakers?\". So yes, this is nothing but a word-of-mouth marketing strategy at its best.\n\nIt's not possible to measure the analytics or conversion rate but over 1 billion downloads say something.\n\n13. **Uber**\n\nHow could a brand single-handedly take down the traditional taxi business? By knowing the enemy and the customer.\n\nHailing a cab after a night out is a pain in the ass, likewise in bad weather conditions. Uber knew that, and at the beginning, they focused on these key events.\n\nThey also picked a subtle fight with yellow cabs by highlighting the areas where Uber excels like; easy payment, lower prices and no more taxi-hailing.\n\nPeople that were using the service were coming back, so they offered a $20 free ride to the new users to lure them in. After that, things went very fast, now we look at taxis like they're an endangered animal.\n\n**Takeaway:** There is always room to fit in with your product and outsmart the competition. Understand your competitors, customers and the environment to come up with smart tactics.\n\n**14. Hotmail**\n\nHotmail's growth hacking strategy is super simple and many companies like Apple copy-pasted it.\n\nHotmail placed a default signature line to every outgoing email and invited receivers to create a free account. Afterward, Apple and others used the same e-mail marketing strategy to spread awareness and grow their customer base.\n\n**15. Hubspot**\n\nHubspot created a free tool that measures your site's performance by grading key factors like SEO, mobile performance and so on. Then it gives you tips to optimize your site.\n\nPeople shared this tool with each other, it got many backlinks and quite a lot of attention on social media platforms as well.\n\nNo surprise, Hubspot grew its email list and grew to 15.000 users with the help of this one tool.\n\n**Takeaway:** Many brands create little add-ons, apps and tools that solve a problem for their target audience. Afterward, they launch it on platforms like Product Hunt to get free exposure.\n\n**16. Airbnb**\n\nAirbnb leeched its competitor Craigslist's blood and used them as a distribution channel for a long time.\n\nTheir growth hacking strategy consisted of two parts.\n\n**One**\n\nThey encourage their audience to cross-post their listing on Craigslist with a link back to their Airbnb profile. This way, hosts increased their chance to get rented and Airbnb got new users.\n\nEventually, it got tons of free traffic and generated thousands of users.\n\n**Two**\n\nNext, they contacted existing Craigslist hosts and asked them to sign up on Airbnb.\n\nThese two strategies helped them to grow their customer base and traffic without spending a dime.\n\nIt worked because it was a win-win.\n\nAnother one from Airbnb\n\nYou know how important the pictures are when it comes to renting or buying a house. The founders of Airbnb knew this too.\n\nTo grow bigger, they started to photograph their hosts' apartments. After the platform grew big enough, they hired an army of pro photographers to make their customers happy. And make some more $.\n\n**Takeaways:**\n\nYour target audience is already hanging out somewhere on the internet, find them and think of new ways to transform them into your customers. Don't expect value if you don't provide value.\n\n**17. Dollar Shave Club**\n\nPicking a fight with a strong argument is a deadly growth hacking strategy. Dollar Shave Club used video marketing to declare war to razor industry giants by asking these simple questions:\n\n\\- Do you like spending $20 a month on a brand named razor?\n\n\\- Do you think your razor needs a vibrating handle and flashlight?\n\nAnd Mike, the founder, gives the solution to his audience in this witty video.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG9qYTJMsI&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG9qYTJMsI&amp;t=1s)\n\nThe video went viral and got 26M views. Please watch if you're not one of the 26M people.\n\n**Takeaway:** Think of a problem in your industry and, use content marketing, show how your product could solve this issue. Especially video marketing is an effective way to show your brand personality and deliver your message.\n\nYou can learn everything you need to start with video marketing by reading this eBook:\n\n**18. Dropbox**\n\nDropbox is known for its creative onboarding process and referral program.\n\nThe marketing strategy is quite simple. The product itself offers storage space in the cloud and they reward people with more space by gamifying the onboarding process.\n\nJust like in the story Hansel &amp; Gretel, they embellish this hard process by offering little treats. And the main course was their referral program where they offered 500MB free extra storage.\n\nIt works like this. You refer Dropbox to a friend, she signs up and you both get 500MB extra storage. 1 stone, 2 birds.\n\nSo the cost of customer acquisition for Dropbox is 500MB. This is definitely one of the nastiest growth hacking techniques.\n\n**Takeaway:** One, If you can give extra value, you can make the onboarding process fun and rewarding for your users. Two, design a double-sided referral program. Offer something to the referrer and the referee.\n\nThat's all folks!\n\nIf you like it let me know in the comments.

Same thing with picking a fight with taxis, was that done through aggressive marketing or something? \n\nMaybe I\u2019m missing something but the $20 bonus for first time customers seems completely unrelated to everything else in the Uber section.\n\nAll the other examples in the post were cool examples of growth hacking though, I love anecdotes like those.",

To suggest that hubspot is as big as it\u2019s today because of some \u201chack\u201d, is frankly, to insult all the hard work their amazing support team does. And engineering. And the influencers they have. \n\nTo suggest that we can come up with a gimmicky hack to grow a dumb idea is insulting. Pls stop buying this snake oil. Work to genuinely delight your customers. Work on smart campaign. Learn to see 80% of your campaigns not exactly materialize. Learn to maximize any advantage you can get. Learn to put yourself in prospects shoes by way of customer journeys and persona developments. \n\n\nThere\u2019s no growth hacking.",

Growth marketing is all about AAARRR funnel and like you said, these brands have a super hardworking and organized team to harness and maintain growth over the years.\n\nFor me, a growth hack is a key campaign that gives businesses headstart. A smart way to grow big in a short time. It's equally important to maintain it with a holistic approach like pirate funnel.",

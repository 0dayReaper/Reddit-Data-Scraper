Ask people to review your resume before you apply and ask for what might be good steps to take to be better prepared for a job there\n6. *Then* apply but also ask your new contact to help flag the resume internally, or maybe submit it on your behalf.\n\nThis is the critical logical flow of applications. Like internet dating, mass applications has distorted the sense of what *work* is here. Apply feels like work but it isn\u2019t. Relationship building is work.",

With as many applications as you have submitted I think it might be time to look at your resume. \n\nTailor each resume to the company and role you are looking at. Make a cover letter for each application, introduce what you bring to the table, summarize the pain point (user must have this cert, or experience in this software), the disarm any objections they might have (I have a visa for credits in college, while I have never used your version of software I am familiar with it's competition and know it well). \n\nAnother thing to consider is if you are comfortable with in person meetings find some small businesses you like or some startups. Go knock on the door and ask if they are hiring. Then ask if they want to conduct an interview. I was always encouraged when I reachedout to managers through different channels than the rest. But I certainly wouldn't do this unless your resume is means for them, not a cookie cutter version.\n\nThese are things that have worked for me and things I like to look for. /R/resume can certainly be more helpful and give you a resume makeover.",

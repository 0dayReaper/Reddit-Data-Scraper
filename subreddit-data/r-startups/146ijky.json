Sorry for the inconveniance.**\n\nI'm an AI engineer, I'm interested in identifying underdeveloped areas in digital marketing where AI can make a significant impact, &amp; make it accessible for the public, I am against select number of companies having access to this technology.\n\nWhat has not been created yet that's on your mind? What would you like to see created? Which existing AI/ML-based services do believe could benefit from improvements or refinements?\n\nI have experience in a range of ML algorithms, such as supervised learning techniques (e.g., linear regression, support vector machines), unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering algorithms, dimensionality reduction), and reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks).\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

As I said to the other redditor, 'apple music, spotify, soundcloud, youtube music, pandora, deezer, etc. All music apps doing the same bullshit, and they're still all giant companies.' 'multiple companies doing the same thing confirms there's market validation for you, just come in with a specific niche &amp; dominate it. The market cap for the AI industry is too large to even consider them as a competitor. I hope you don't proceed with great ideas you may have then abandon them because you see other companies doing it, that's not the way to go.'\n\n**If you can address this problem, who is gonna pay you money?**\n\nB2B\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**These are some of the important questions I can think of right now. As you see, none of these are related to \"how\" you are gonna do it.**\n\nI'm not coming at you when I say this, but with all respect I think you dont understand the terminologies I was using to describe those ideas. Ex: 'to examine users' social media engagement, interests, and digital behavior, generating comprehensive psychographic profiles for more accurate ad targeting and personalized content suggestions.' That does explain how it would ado it.\n\n**However, you only talked about how you will do those. Tbh, this sounds more like \"you have a hammer, you see everything as a nail.\" kinda thing.**\n\nI know, as I stated I was not creating a startup... I wanted this reddits thoughts on what they think should be created, I just listed ideas as inspiration\n\n**You need to start asking for the right questions before jumping onto a startup. Also I would highly recommend working at a startup before jumping onto your own.**\n\nI worked at multiple startups, and I worked at Scale AI &amp; Braze, but again im not creating a startup or selling anything, sorry for the misinterpation",

Facebook released their \"segment anything\" tool. They wrote detectron2 and released, they share more and more stuff. They shared LLaMa which allows for everyone to create their llm models. Google created tensorflow, facebook pytorch. So we are now able to write our deep learning models in a few hours.\n\nSo many companies are releasing some of their work to enable others work faster. \n\nThe publications in ML/AI are mostly if not all open access.",

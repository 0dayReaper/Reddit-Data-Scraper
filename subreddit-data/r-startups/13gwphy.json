I have a few ideas but wanted to gather some more from the community. Essentially he has 6-8 developers who do their jobs at an okay ish level at best and have no drive to do better. They are good with being below average developers. He wants them to work on up skilling and becoming better developers and people. He is big into giving his people chances and working towards making them better people and better for the company. Doesn't believe in switching people out unless no other choice. He thinks since it is all of them it is a company culture problem not a person issue.\n\nAny ideas on how we can make this happen?",

Make them part of the team and give them more of a say and leadership in the direction of the company. Make them aware of the struggles of the business, too. Things like \"we have enough runway for 12 months at our current spend rate. If we get the MVP done in 6, that gives us some time to bring on new customers while we spend the next 6 making incremental improvements.\" Give them feedback from the customers so they can feel the pain points and want to improve them or hear how they are making lives better and want to do more.",

There's no stability or promise of it. No large checks. No bonuses (likely). I imagine not very much PTO or benefits that can compete with larger competitors. \n\nThe employees also do not own the company, or portions of it (unless they do, but this is extremely rare). There's no loss for them if it doesn't go well, even if it's their only source of income right now.\n\nPeople are people, you hire people. You don't hire past experience. If they never projected ambition, a go-getter attitude, a past or desire to learn, etc then what do employers really think they're hiring?\n\nI worked for a small company. It was about 50 when I started, and now it's nearly double that size in just 4 years. They changed, and many people left, and new people never stuck around for more than a couple weeks. Many ghosted. Some of us who were there for those 4 years of growth (they were around for about 7 years when I started) grew, gained certifications, took care of anything and everything, worked as a team. But eventually, things change. I ended up leaving not too far from my 4th year. Others quit after I did. A handful got fired. And now they have about 1/4 as many techs as they use to, and they can't even get any decent applicants. \n\nYour employees attitudes and work ethics are based on a few ingredients:\n\n\\- incentives (money, certifications, classes, bonuses, profit sharing, PTO etc)\n\n\\- purpose (what are they building? Are they passionate about it?)\n\n\\- autonomy (are you guys micromanaging? Having to do daily meetings to talk about problems that aren't fixed or having redundant meetings?)\n\nWithout those being met, why would they do more than the minimum?",

All these people around me with just 0 drive.  I have to do everything myself.  No one wants to grow into an opportunity or do MORE.  \n\nI went through 20 or so employees before I got one who wasn't like this.  No one else changed.  That person was a good producer on their own.  The rest of the team didn't rise to the challenge or the competition.\n\nUgh, is this person the exception?\n\nAlong came another one!  Alright, it's not me, some people just have drive and some don't.  And here and there I scoop up someone driven and motivated who maybe could make the jump.  \n\nHalf of people are below average.  That's just how averages work.\n\nSome of the above average people just have different goals.  They just need to put food on the table for their family.  That's their only goal.\n\nNow here's the REAL kicker.  You know that saying 'make sure you're put yourself in a room with smarter people than you?\"\n\nWe'll, that's ironic.  Or oxymoronic, I forget.  But it is.  Because: If everyone's goal is to be in a room of people smarter than them, you can't be in a room with people smarter than you.  Because you being dumber than everyone else means they're failing to do the same.\n\nMoral of the story: anyone as smart and as driven as you will probably want to do their own thing or a bigger piece of the pie than you're capable of offering.\n\nIn my situation this 100% makes sense too.  Anyone who I would want to step up and manage and run and grow into my general or regional managers?  They're just as likely to want to own something for themselves.  So they're likely doing that.  It would be the rare exception for someone smart and capable enough to replace myself to be willing to be my employee.\n\nEmploying people is indeed a paradox.",

This can happen if the leader isn\u2019t that inspiring for whatever reason. When economic incentives are lacking, recognition for good work is often also a fulfilling experience for someone that\u2019s inspired by their leader and believes in the project.\n\nThey may also lack economic incentives. If I know I\u2019ll get X regardless for doing the bare minimum, I probably will do the bare minimum. Jobs are a lot like school, you get tasks that feel like homework you don\u2019t actually care about or feel inspired by. It\u2019s just a job. \n\nSo imagine. If you\u2019re not inspired, don\u2019t care for recognition, and have a set salary, and doing more or the same as current will result in no additional economic benefits\u2026. Why. Why would anyone want to invest more of their lifetime or better. I can\u2019t see other reasons for why things are like this. It\u2019s got to be both\u2026 maybe. \n\nNo real life experience.

Is he strong technically? In my experience the problem usually stems from someone not particularly skilled (or with no technical background) doing the hiring and not realizing they're hiring relatively low-productivity workers, or how much more productivity they could find if they knew what to look for.",

In which case the conversation needs to be like: can your company succeed with mediocre developers? (Sometimes the answer is yes.) If not, do you understand that not aggressively restructuring the team will result in them all losing their jobs anyway, let alone the loss for your friend and the rest of the team if the company fails?

I used to work more for less and do everything asap but the real problem was that in my department the people working above me didn\u2019t cared about anything except their own growth and not the company and everyone else. Even one of the coworkers encouraged to work slow and delay rather than to appreciate the one who is doing. \n\nSo, recently i heard from my colleagues still working there, that the manager from another department left the position coz of my department where i used to work. And i never saw anyone really taking interest in improving as the HR didn\u2019t cared about the employees rather saw their own interests and the manger\u2019s interests as to keep there job. \n\nAccording to me, I would suggest that someone unknown but personal should work in their own company to listen the problem from every department and don\u2019t let anyone know except the owner and fix the issue periodically to keep up with employees, HR and Managers. Hope this works out.",

Or do they actually get rewarded for higher output?  hint: bi-weekly paycheques is the least effective way to incentive people, they will only work hard enough not to get fired, unless there is some concrete assurance that working harder will result in more money.\n\n\\- Sometimes it is indeed a people problem, some people are just better at what they do, and there isn't much hope in changing them to be  better.  Its a business, not a school, don't pay people to learn on your time. Hiring someone who is better is indeed the way to go sometimes,  don't wait until you don't have any other choice, often then it will be too late, and your business will have significant damage done.\n\n\\- Hire the best, be really really picky.  Some developers are like 10 times better than average, I'm not joking, they do exist.  You can replace a team of 10 medicore devs with 2 good ones,  just make sure to pay them really well.  Like 2X the average,  and you will still be getting more production then with 10 at an average rate.",

You need 2-3 rockstars not 6-8 mediocre devs. \n\nConsider replacing the team and giving extremely high salaries to a few people that get shit done and get it done fast. Sounds brutal but think to yourself \u201cif I had to start a new company and hire 2 people, would X be one of those?\u201d\n\nYou need to breed motivation once you\u2019re sure you have the talent, this could be significant equity or significant salary. Ideally a mixture of both. \n\nThere\u2019s no use paying someone more if they\u2019re at their limits in terms of product-vision and/or technical ability.\n\nThis is coming from a dev btw.",

How did he screen for people's talents and motivations? Everyone has a tiny handful of things they are passionate about, and are perfectly happy to coast through life with everything else. I have zero interest in being a great cook or a fast typist. I am perfectly happy to be a below average typist and a bad cook. There are people who feel similarly about software development. If you have a bad candidate funnel and interview process, you will inevitably end up with people with minimal intrinsic motivation. \n\nDepending on what you're building, maybe that's perfectly fine. But if you hire mediocre developers, don't expect them to upskill themselves into good developers. That would be like marrying an alcoholic and expecting them to give up drinking. It just doesn't work. You can remove any barriers that are holding people back, but it's almost impossible to change someone's intrinsic nature.",

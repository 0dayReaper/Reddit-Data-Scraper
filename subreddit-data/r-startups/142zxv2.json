    "postText": "I had a solid clinic with my ex wife. The year before our divorce, our revenue was almost half a million. \n\nI ran the backend, she saw patients and made sure the other therapists were HIPAA compliant. \n\nShe tanked the business, I agreed to let her buy me out, and I\u2019d like to rebuild a new clinic with a head therapist. \n\nThe problem is there aren\u2019t any SLPs I know that have enough experience to be a head therapist AND that I trust to stick around to make the business model work. I don\u2019t want to be left high and dry looking for another head therapist. \n\nShort of going back to school to become an SLP myself, I\u2019m not sure how to find a therapist to rebuild with. I put out calls on job sites and got a lot of young therapists that just don\u2019t have the experience to oversee client care and HIPAA compliance on a level I\u2019m comfortable with. \n\nIt\u2019s healthcare. You can\u2019t treat people like numbers.",

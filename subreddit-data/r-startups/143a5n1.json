    "postText": "I am the cofounder of a small startup. My startup is getting acquired by a US based startup for under 1 mil.The purchasing number has been decided and we are moving towards compensation and other tidbits. My question is how should we decide what compensation we founders should be getting? We have just a year of experience in industry after graduation. Our profiles will be product manager and industry is mobility/transportation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: This was our first startup right after college so we are pretty inexperienced and we are getting acquired within a year. The acquiring company is interested to integrate our products into their portfolio and also us founders, since we have experience in the industry.\n\nEDIT: The acquiring company is a 1-2 year old startup. Founders and advisors are ex-founders of Series B/C companies.",

If you are taking your product forward with these people they should treat you seriously and reward you appropriately.\n\nI would say you should find out what role they are giving you, and ask for parity with the acquiring company\u2019s pay scale for that role. You could then offer a small discount, like 10%, to reflect your being remote. But don\u2019t start by negotiating a number - negotiate a position.\n\nEdit: I agree that offering a remote discount is a bad idea. You should be paid for what you contribute, not where you are working.",

You can say minus 10% for remote, but you could also say plus 20% because you are better than everyone else.\n\nWhere did you get $65k from?",

Also information about the acquiring company and their stage/size is also important. \n\nDon\u2019t think about your experience at this point (only being a year out of college). Focus on what your role will be in that post-acquisition role, and then figure out what fair compensation for that type of role in any company would be worth. \n\nFor instance, if your role will be junior engineer, then $65k is low, but not terribly off. If your role is VP of Product, but the company is a series a startup, then that\u2019s going to be very low. If project lead of a billion dollar Corp, then it\u2019s way too low. \n\nDetails are helpful.",

The role is important, and if you\u2019re being acquired, you should push for compensation commensurate with your role. Figure the role out, then figure out compensation appropriate for that role/company/industry/stage. \n\nThen you can make location adjustments later.",

First of all, they are acquiring your company so at some level they view you as more senior than your literal years of experience. They have also already decided to pay $1m or whatever the purchase price is to make this happen - meaningful changes in comp to you can still seem like small amounts relative to the overall purchase price.\n\nI would ask them what mid-level or senior engineers are getting paid at their company in the US and try to get that, or use it as a starting point for the negotiation.",

And you will probably not be able to close that gap completely. But also it\u2019s always a negotiation, so it\u2019s a question ultimately of how bad they want you (badly enough to spend $1 million upfront or whatever), how willing you are to walk away (ultimately I think you will take what they give you, I presume, particularly since I imagine you are getting some of that $1 million as well), and how easily they can hire an equivalent remote developer to do the same job (again presumably not *that* easily given they\u2019re paying $1 million for your company).\n\nYou should be polite and careful - if I were you I wouldn\u2019t want to piss them off - but you shouldn\u2019t negotiate against yourself and your starting position should be that you\u2019re a treat engineer and they should treat you like they\u2019d treat any other great engineer.\n\n(Their starting position will be \u2018we are already paying all this money to buy the company, you are based in India, you don\u2019t have a lot of experience.\u2019 And you will meet somewhere in between these two positions)",

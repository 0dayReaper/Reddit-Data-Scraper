I\u2019m realising more and more that I want to focus my efforts on working with/for start up companies, helping grow them and in return receiving equity.\n\nHow do people typically move from industry into the start-up scene? Is it all down to networking or are there specific skill sets that people acquire that makes them attractive to these companies?",

            "comment": "I work at a startup and know a few founders. I can share how you can get hired. \n\n**Build a portfolio/asset base**: Startups mostly hire based on what you can do for them. Resumes matter very little. Can you do X? Come join. Can you do Y? Come join. \n\nTo show what you can do, build a portfolio/case study of showing how you worked on a project and the outcome you got from that. You'll see why this is important soon.\n\n**Value, vision match**: If you share the same beliefs and visions as the core team, you'll get hired.\n\nAnd now, to maximize your chance of working with startup founders, I suggest the following ideas:\n\n1. **Cold email the founder you want to work with**: I did this and it changed my life! Keep the email short. Add value and share a link to your portfolio (this is why building an assest/portfolio is important). This did the trick for me.\n2. **Attend conference/meetups and let people know of your hidden interests**: Many startup founders attend conferences. I once went to an entrepreneur meetup. And one of my hidden talents is that I'm a chess master. There, I got connected with a founder of a big app company because he too was an avid chess player who wanted to simply play a game of chess with me. Now I already work at a fantastic startup so I didn't pitch him 'what I can offer for him'. But I'm definitely sure he'll listen to me if I did :)\n3. **Linkedin:** This I would say is the traditional path. It has worked for many people. Can work for you. But the competition is insanely high.",

I help out on loads of work projects for big companies, but they rarely will have any value to start ups. Or are you referring to personal projects such as app development, digital marketing etc?\n\n2) I\u2019ve been thinking about attending entrepreneur events for a while, could you share some of your experiences as to what they\u2019re like? As I\u2019m not an \u2018entrepreneur\u2019 myself (in that I don\u2019t have a business), but am instead a bidding entrepreneur (I will one day have one) will I be welcome still?\n\nThanks in advance",

By portfolio base, I meant showing your work - Like if you're an app developer, show the app you have built, if you're a copywriter, show your great content pieces. Not sure what the portfolio base is for someone who does taxes. But maybe you can write a case study? Like you did X and saved XX for a brand. That's a good asset base. **If you've helped big companies, I\"m sure there must be something you've done that startups will find valuable**. Find that something. Because if you can solve the problem of the startup, they'll most likely hire you.\n2. Conferences are fun. You meet a bunch of interesting people. I went to a casual networking event, found it via Facebook. You don't need to be an entrepreneur to attend them. Even if you're someone who can be 'valuable' to the entrepreneurs, you'll be welcome.",

The whole purpose of a portfolio base is to communicate your aptitude to solving startup problems.   \n\n\nI'd advise you to brainstorm how the skills you've learned in corporate-world can transfer to startup-land.   \n\n\nWhat startups need aren't just raw skills, we outsource problems that need those and for much cheaper generally. Rather, it's the combination of various skills, expertise and a unique perspective.   \n\n\nStart with what interests you. Do you want to work with a tax focused startup? Something else entirely? What problems do you want to solve? Then start thinking what value you bring to the table of a nascent company. If you think hard enough, a lot of those seemingly undervalued skills you learned in corporate-world are very transferrable. \n\nHalf the work is being open minded and flexible enough to apply your knowledge to new things. The other half is communicating it to the founders you want to work with.",

They wined and dined us and  put on networking events where their employees could chat with new and innovative companies.\n\nI made decent contacts at those events and got introduced to folk and advised by a number of directors. No equity changed hands, people helped cos they could.\n\nAlthough had someone been specialised or fit a gap in our business there was always a chance we could invite them to be our mentor or on an advisory board for monthly meetings. These things often come with equity arrangements for remuneration.\n\nIf your company is not involved in these types of events then I'd advise getting in touch with accelerators and see if they have any gaps in their knowledge about tax or any other specialism. Mentoring at accelerators is a good way to meet startups and give to the communities. However, startup world and the big4 are entirely different eco-systems. Your address book and contacts are likely more valuable than your tax knowledge at this stage imo.",

But I believe if you trusted your partners enough to get into this, you should trust their judgment- especially if this isn\u2019t your field. \n\nYour investors probably won\u2019t like this. But investors will always be happy and excited when things are going their way - and will flip the switch the second it isn\u2019t. I think this is to be expected. If you\u2019re the CEO, it\u2019s your call. You make the call to do what you think is best and push your CFO in the direction you think the company needs to go. And even then, if you do not have experience - maybe you need to stay in your lane.",

Possible to define metrics on it? Then put up some hypothesis on how to improve those. Once you have a list of hypothesis, you could design as cheap as possible and as fast as possible experiments to validate. \n\nRun the experiments and once you found something that works, could start to spend more on it.",

These are different tracks, completely incompatible. A successful milestone for one is a failure for another and vice versa.\n\nLifestyle biz will never make $1B in revenue and that's OK. It is also ok to move slow, building a small niche business sustainably. Margins matter a lot; spending needs to be prudent. Growth isn't a key metric to track.\n\nVC biz is kinda the opposite. The only thing that matters is time. Milestones are all about growth - of usage or revenue - relative to the time it took to hit them. You must consistently demonstrate that you are on track to $1B, no matter how early - you may not be building the right thing, but then it means you change quickly what you build and start over, tracking growth. The likelihood of $1B is ofc low but at any point in time your biz needs to credible project to it, and be able to back it up with past results - either growth milestones unlocked, or past efforts discarded and new efforts looking good via the same lens.\n\nThe hard thing to internalise is that this is a black and white split. There's nothing in between. These models are not compatible. They are for different people even - employees and founders must agree on the desired outcome, otherwise you'll have internal tension that will kill the co before the market does. An $10m exit for example is great for a lifestyle biz but considered a write-off / soft landing on a VC track. But then funders will probably get most of that lifestyle biz's 10m; whereas on the VC track it will all go towards liabilities.\n\nJust be clear what kind of biz you are building.",

I have a business partner in one business I can't trust at all and we're working on removing him from the company. \n\nMy advice is to communicate. Have honest conversations with him and get each other's thoughts and feelings on the table and strategize on potential ways to move forward while being budget conscious. Communication is possibly the most important aspect of business partner relationships.

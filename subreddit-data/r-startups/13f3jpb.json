    "postText": "Hi guys, I launched my first startup back in March 2021, I grew to 5k users with about 100 or so daily active. It'd have bouts of expulsions in user count then go back down. I built it not knowing how difficult it's be to raise funding so I ended up bootstrapping longer than I could handle. My biggest expense was a developer and I didn't have the best job at the time. I ended up getting sick end of 2021 and decided to announce it'd be shutting down and having to let go of my dev.  Although I pretty much got zero'd, I was able to leverage the experience to get into tech sales and quickly climbed from a BDR to a top SE. I can now afford to bring things back with no outside funding + I know how to build it without a dev, however, should I leverage the brand I built before or start from scratch?",

Google it, and see if there is negative reviews, positive reviews or nothing? \nUse the same LLC? Is there any debt? Do you own 100%? \n\nI think you should break down all the assets and take it from there. \n\nAt this stage it is just you trying to figure it out, so your reputation is probably more important then the company's. \n\nUnless this is just a marketing question, then look at what yours looks like and look what it would cost you to start again.",

The debt was in my name but I can pay it off quickly, I have interest free til 2024 since I bootstrapped with interest free debt. It was an app so nothing physical. I was hoping mostly to leverage the small amount of branding I had to build again and bring back some of my old users",

You can still reach out to those communities and try to leverage your old brand with something to the effect of \"try xxx from the original creators of yyy.\"",

Do you really have a brand if you closed it? what about the users who were using your service but had to switch to something else because you closed down? would they give you chance again? do you have any negative press associated with it i.e. users frustrated with closing of service and complaining in social media?\n\nif answere to previous questions is yes than start from scratch if the answer is not revive it. May be start by attempting to revive it and see the users reaction if they react positively than continue with it else start from scratch.",

When building a startup I believe it's safe if you don't focus on funding. You should think of alternative ways to keep your startup going. Alternative ways like using free their party applications. Cutting the cost of unnecessary things. Don't spend all your money hiring developers that you don't and lastly focus on making your app better on a single platform (web/ mobile apps).",

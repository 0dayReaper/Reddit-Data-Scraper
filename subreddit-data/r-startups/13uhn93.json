Few markets are so saturated that there is genuinely no market left. Pick an area with enough competition that it validates you have an addressable market, but not so big that you are competing with the extremely large companies.\n\nFor example, I work for Akkio, a machine learning Startup focused on making predictive AI available in a no-code way to data analysts. This specific niche is a good area because:\n-\tLots of other companies doing it, meaning we have a good market that would use our product\n-\tNo huge competition. Most of the giants are trying to streamline things for data *scientists*, not a data analyst like we are. We attempt to fill the gap of companies that don\u2019t have the resources for a full data scientist to custom-train models for them, but still want to reap the benefit.\n\nYou generally don\u2019t need a disruptive idea. Sure, you generally need ways to differentiate yourself (ours is our focus on data analysts as well as our focus on ease of use) but you don\u2019t at all need a disruptive idea, because odds are that May decrease your total addressable market.",

It's in how well you execute them. Seeing what others are doing, you can investigate if you can differentiate more readily and build that into your business strategy. Customers get bored when a product/service stagnates, and established one-hit-wonders never learn how to learn from their competition.

There are three things slowing progress:\n\n- As you can tell, the vision is ultimately B2C. So this comes with inherent dangers like affordability, extreme cost/value discrepancies from customers, and \"Customer wants a faster horse ... Doesn't consider automobiles\" mindsets. I'm trying to learn about the \"tar pits\" in the domain, but gathering lessons-learned is challenging as folks believe sharing creates a competitive disadvantage or even discomfort sharing not-so-glamorous learnings.\n- Given the state of the market, most folks favor lowering the risk of a robotics venture by either using a B2B strategy favoring domain customers (I'm my case hospitality), manufacturing, or government. This has the unfortunate side-effect of locking the business into supporting a few key customers instead of generalizing to the public at large. I'm trying to assess if there's a happy-medium strategy, and if it's even needed. This really distracts from pursuing customers for input as now the scope and tactics change.\n- Again, given the state of the market, it's hard to find experienced folks who are able to commit to working with me. I completely understand their risk assessment and impact to their families. I'm treating this as a slowdown because I can get everything done with fewer, but it takes a really long time.\n\nI welcome all constructive advice and encouragement. I'm committed to not stopping, but there are times when the phrase \"how are you rapidly scaling?\" makes me anxious. Thankfully there isn't money on the table yet, so there's no one but myself to answer to. But I don't want it to stay that way for too long.",

Here in African countries most of the big entrepreneurs are a bit older and most of their money-making ventures are physical business. Even though they clearly see tech is the new money, but they are too hesitant to dip their funds because they don't understand how it works!\n\nBut other than that, my team and I have the next big thing (Disruptive) in our country which will affect millions of people because it is a social problem majority of people are facing. \n\nAnd the reason the big companies are not engaging in providing solution it is because they are busy with their own sustaining innovations!",

            "comment": "Having a startup is just not for most people. Statistically, you are most likely average so being a cog in a machine is best bet for you, your fear is trying to protect you. It is much better to work on being better in a great job, you will most likely earn more money that by founding a startup. 90% of founders don't earn any good money compared to work they put in.\n\nEspecially today when you can earn 1-3 million dollars a year as an employee while startup founders usually get like 100k + you are much more likely to earn good money in real estate or other kinds of expensive sales than by trying to change the world.\n\nThen startups are way to \"wash\" money for some people. Aristocracy with direct access to money from gov. printer or amazing network of wealthy individuals use being investor-or-founder as way to explain their unfair wealth. They don't want general public to go after them (having wealth they don't deserve, by not being by productive for society), they find creative ways to show they are better than you hence deserve wealth - these are also most artists with own ateliers or NFT creators. Aristocracy shuffles and multiplies money inside the group.\n\nBut back on topic. Startups are for people who have a mission and grifters who know how to play a game and suck the system by jumping from hot thing to hot thing.\n\nBut, the problem is, if you have a mission you can't do anything else, you have no choice. \n\nSo if you are a founder you know you are.\n\nOur biology and hence society has evolved in a way where there is 0.7% of crazy creative, motivated and strategic individuals who come up with moonshots that push us all forward. Then they have a service group who help them early for hope of bigger compensation. \n\nAlso in this era of industrialized factory startup ecosystem the game is a bit different. Venture capitalists are funding their favourites more than great ideas. Especially what I mean is they are funding people with high consciousness, basically great brain chemistry producing dopamine-drive and a couple of other things - but primarily people being great OPERATORS.\n\nAt this point everyone knows what all the good ideas are (we are talking industrial investing, billions that need to be moved. Of course there are few outliers). What is needed is to have extremely competent operators who can turn money into companies and processes and HR and product, and that is a bit disconnected from the PRODUCT itself.\n\nMeaning they fund great personalities multiple times whatever they do. Investors don't care. They get % from what they deploy-invest. So they just want to give 1 billion to whoever can do something that looks like it was worth it. Just by the rules of the nature if you deploy billion to start companies you will get something back, so they show you that as a proof of work. \n\nBut truly this is just in-group multiplication of energy (money) between themselves.\n\nGreat thing about West is that you can enter the game so ... you can become a cinderella. But the truth is this is not for most people. \n\nNot even for 1%. Its like 0.5.",

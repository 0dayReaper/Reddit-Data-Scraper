It has to be an online tool, like when you share a link to LN on your profile instead of your resume.\n\nWhat are commonly used tools in the startup community for this purpose? Could someone provide insights into the advantages and benefits of these tools in helping startups effectively manage and communicate their data to investors?",

There are lots of templates or suggested structures out there for data rooms. Do a bit of digging, see what fits and what you like, and try them out. Don\u2019t spend too much time on it and ask someone who is not too familiar with your company to review it for you; you need someone who won\u2019t fill your gaps with their knowledge of what you are doing.",

    "postText": "Having just graduated (&lt;2 weeks ago) with a degree in Computer Science, I've spent a significant amount of time both learning about and building software on top of the recent developments in AI and Machine Learning.  \nA few months ago, a friend of mine came to me for advice on how to implement LLM (think ChatGPT) based technologies into his current user-product. Since then, a number of friends have reached out to learn more about the field.  \nGiven the growing demand for experts in the field, I am planning to establish an AI consulting company. I will help companies develop a roadmap for integrating new AI capabilities into their business and potentially assist in building said integrations too.  \nBut before I dive headfirst into this endeavor, I wanted to reach out to this amazing community for advice, suggestions, and potential connections.  \n**How can I find my first clients?**  \nMy current belief is that I should offer free services, learning about what companies need and building my reputability as a contractor.  \n**What steps should I take for long-term success?**  \nI figure I need a website, social media, LLC, and employment-contracts. If y'all have any advice on how to go about the aforementioned steps / other steps that will be important, please let me know!!  \nThanks y'all for reading, feel free to reach out either privately or in the comments for more information, or to just connect!\n\n\\- Blake",

To find a lead list, I would recommend checking out companies that graduated from Y Combinator and TechStars and reach out to the founders on LinkedIn.  Finding your first couple clients is gonna be a numbers game. Once you have them, you should create case studies on your website and hope they pass on your name to other companies.  \n\n\nAnother step you can do is go to tech conferences and networking events. There you will meet a lot of tech founders and decision makers.",

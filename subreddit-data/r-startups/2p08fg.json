    "postText": "About a month before Halloween, my friend Jon and I had an idea to turn emojis into real physical masks you could wear. We wanted to launch it for Halloween. The whole project cost us $3,609 to launch. So far it has generated $51,365 in revenue. We wrote up a massive case study about everything from manufacturing, marketing, costs, big wins, and low lows. Hope you guys enjoy it! Feel free to ask us any questions in the comments.\n\nhttp://needwant.com/p/how-our-side-project-generated-51365-in-60-days/",

                                    "comment": "&gt; For trademark violations you have to litigate or you risk losing the trademark.\n\nThis is absolutely not true. \n\nFor a trademark to be judged \"in the public domain\" it must have lost its secondary meaning as relating to your product. This can happen no matter how much you sue people, or it can be safe even if you never take legal action. \n\nFor example - In the late 90s, I would say Xerox was in extremis about losing their Trademark on \"xerox,\" despite suing the pants off anyone they could find. The simple fact was that \"xerox\" meant \"make a photocopy\" and an ad that said \"Brother Brand Home Xerox Machines\" probably wouldn't have raised a question in many people's minds. IMHO, what saved Xerox was the explosion of scanners, laser printers, and the wholesale transition to email &amp; web that basically shoved the office copier back into a back room. \n\nOn the flip side, in the 1970s, Playboy basically didn't pay attention to what was going on with the rabbit's head, and although they were heading for territory where \"Rabbit head logo\" could have meant \"swinging bachelor type\", they didn't quite get there. When Christie Hefner took over, she reined in the trademark and started aligning it with the Playboy brand again. \n\nThat said, of course you want to police your trademarks. However, what you want to keep in mind is that the fundamental principle behind trademark law is \"consumer protection\" and \"protecting the brand investment.\" You want to keep your brand aligned with your business and your product. So if someone is using your brand in a way that enhances that alignment (for example, selling add-ons to your product), then you don't have to stop them from doing it, and a great way to build market goodwill would be to reach out to the person using it with a polite \"We see you are using our trademark to sell enhancements to our products. Would you be interested in a formal partnership? If not, no worries - please feel free to follow the enclosed branding guide, but we do ask that you use the mark in a way that makes it clear your add-ons are your product and not supported by us. Thank you.\" \n\n(Don't copy and paste that - it's just meant to be notional. Please engage the services of an intellectual property attorney for this kind of work)",

Heck, that's what Apple did in making versions of the emoji being used in Japan.  You can't copy the exact font, but there are plenty of different fonts from different people that look similar to each other. \n\nOP's masks are pretty far from being exact copies of anybody's emoji font. They're not even fonts. The article doesn't say they took Apple's fonts and simply blew them up. I'm no IP lawyer but it seems to me this would be a pretty easy case to defend.",

They added 3d to the flat font as well.\n\nSo yes, they are heavily inspired by Apples emoji but how is this different from someone making a Helvetica-like font?  It might look like Helvetica but it isnt.  At what point is something considered \"new\" and unprotected in derivatives?",

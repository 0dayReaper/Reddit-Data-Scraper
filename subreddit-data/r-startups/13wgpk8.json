Well done, I see you know your judo well. \n\nBut did you know, all of these people are considered to be neurodiverse too? \n\nI\u2019m building a start-up that has the potential to set brains free. \n\nIf anyone knows how to easily download and transcribe Spotify audios pls let me know! \n\nSide quest - if you are neurodiverse and a skilled creative designer please drop a comment so I can slide into your prefrontal cortex",

You may google on the net to find a tool that does but not sure it is legal. Just wanted to share with you tools that beautifully do both text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversion.",

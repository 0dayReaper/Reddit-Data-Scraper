    "postText": "Also, how many funding rounds are assumed in \u2018post dilution\u2019 percentage?\n\nI\u2019m offered 0.6% in pre series A valued at $40-$60M, but due to notes that is actually closer to 0.4% today. Im not sure if I tell people I was offered 0.6%, 0.4%, or 0.2% (estimated series C dilution). Hard to know if this is a good deal or not if I don\u2019t know which of these numbers to reference. Appreciate any help on this.",

But for what it is worth I am deeply involved in the equity process and have worked as the stock administrator at two prior positions. \n\nWhen people disclose ownership the most commonly quoted number and the one I think is most meaningful is fully diluted ownership based on the current structure. So in your case the ownership percentage to care about is the .4% if I have understood you correctly. \n\nWhen people talk about projected ownership based on future rounds it is a bunch of made up numbers that may have no basis in reality. The market is going to tell you how many rounds you require and what your worth and dilution are through those rounds. There are both macro and micro influences on those factors that are out of the control of the company, and them telling you that your future ownership will be .2% at some arbitrary future point means nothing.",

Then you will end up with .2% which means the total shares will be 3000. This doesnt make sense tbh. Normally, they create ~20% more shares and from 1000 to 1200. Then 1200 to 1440 or so. \n\nSo with my calculation, your final should be .41% or so. Not .2%",

    "postText": "I am the first business-side hire of a fast-growing pre-seed, healthcare SaaS company. It was clear from the start they were looking for someone to help with marketing/BD and eventually grow it into a senior/c-suite role. I ran with it and pitched a growth path starting out in a BizDev/Biz Ops role. I report directly to the CEO and CMO (Chief Medical Officer).\n\nHere's an overview of the situation:\n\n* Active ARR went from just over 10K to over 160K, not including the 100K we have waiting to implement. Current customer success/support was largely being taken care of by the founders but to offload their bandwidth I took that on.\n* My role has expanded to cover the whole life cycle of the customer. I sit on the first sales call with the CMO, then when they sign, I manage the implementation and onboarding, and I go on-site for go-live training and then also follow up in the customer success phase.\n* My CEO has been in and out due to illness which has meant a lot of start/stop, and then taking on a lot more responsibility. I don't mind since I want to be a senior leader, but it's difficult to manage since I'm also trying to carve out processes.\n* Part of my role also included strategy and assistance for fundraising. I have not had any visibility into this because my CEO is taking the lead on that (as they should) but I feel that I have skills that could be of great assistance (literally have an MBA and already built out a dashboard of ARR tracking, can do FP&amp;A and have it on my to do list to revamp our financial model based on actual numbers).\n\nI got a raise but I'm starting to see that I'm largely underpaid for my position. I'm beginning to wonder capping my earning potential at the moment for a potential upside is even worth the sheer volume of work, process creation and management, constant iteration and problem solving, on top of the instability my founders have that's affecting me downstream.\n\nWhat would you do if you were me? If you need more information, let me know but I didn't want to start off with a novel. Thanks!",

I have led recruiting efforts and basically recruited our PM intern and our UI/UX intern and our customer success guy. I'd like to have the CS guy report to me since I'm basically leading on that stream. It should be a couple of months before we have cash for it but is it dumb to want to tap out before that?",

If you calculated your shares will be worth a lot one day that\u2019s the only right answer\n\nEverything else in between will be misery, tiring, and doesn\u2019t feel worth it. \n\nI don\u2019t know what your options are worth AND how you value your time.",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nWe are currently building a SaaS. We want to create something that is similar to other startups in the same space.\n\nWe want to use those data as part of our discovery and validation, however, I am torn about deciding if I can use the reviews from those competitors rather than get them myself.\n\ntbh, as I see it, those reviews are more than enough validation to prove that our idea will work.\n\nhowever, part of myself tells me it is called \"stealing/plagiarizing\"... Instead what I can do is prove only verbally...\n\nThanks in advance",

If you see a whole bunch of complaints or comments like \u201cSo frustrating I can\u2019t do X\u201d - then go ahead and provide X. It\u2019s not stealing/plagiarizing, it\u2019s listening to customers and tailoring your product to their needs (which is what the original company SHOULD be doing - but clearly isn\u2019t). If you can find a competitive advantage through unhappy customers - then you can make some $$ and some happy customers - a win win. Good luck!",

Just my unpopular opinion. \n\nLike is your \u201cidea\u201d worth that much to you on a personal level where you don\u2019t care about selling something you copied or do you wanna go with maybe a different idea\u2026..\n\nHowever, if you prefer the uncreative route just remember there\u2019s more than one brand of bread \ud83d\ude0e",

Hellllll no. \n\nAnyways, you can reference all day long and you can even \u201ctake\u201d existing stuff and just make it way better. But don\u2019t copy. You can \u201clearn\u201d or adopt some of their \u201cviews\u201d into your own translation if that makes sense. \n\nA fine difference between taking and copying.",

Nothing more.",

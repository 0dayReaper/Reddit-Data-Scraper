    "postText": "I am a small start up raising seed but investment has been really slow and all investors are super keen but want to see MVP. I'm struggling with cash flow to make my MVP. We are starting trials in a few weeks and this will show traction and the market etc. I'd like to start taking orders with the PR we will be getting but it's a slow burner if I don't have this product ready to go. I was given an idea that I should take out credit cards, use one to pay for all the necessary payments and use another card to pay that off. Then just rotate between three of them until I get revenue or investment to pay them off. \nIs this a viable good idea or an absolute idiotic suggestion? \nI have no more financial help available and I am broke. \nWhat have you found works? What should I do?",

It would be better to shutter the idea and get a job than to go negative for the idea.\n\nThat said, it's not an all-or-nothing decision.  Often, people running new startups take on some kind of side hustle to bootstrap their idea along.  What options exist for you to split your time between your startup and something else that will bring in enough cash flow?",

It's still a risky proposition though - investors will want to see you investing in the growth and scale of your company (to earn them a hefty return), not seeing you pay off your accrued debt (instead of investing for their return).",

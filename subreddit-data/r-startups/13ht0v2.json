Most customers don't like being asked to answer survey's,  or like data about them being collected and analysed.\n\nIf you are able to align your own passions and skills up almost exactly with what the customer wants,  then you got a winner.  If you want to obsess about customers, make sure you compensate them for their time and treat them the way you would like to be treated.  Pay them to answer survey's if it comes to that.  Talk to them like people, don't just treat them like a source of income,  they don't like that.",

When you aren\u2019t connecting and building empathy for your customers, it\u2019s easy to forget that they are the core of what you\u2019re doing.",

Sorry, don't mean to be harsh but if your customers are changing your direction or short term roadmap every few days you need to sit down and understand their needs as a company before you are here. \n\nThere is a difference between a grocer saying I need more fruit because people really like bananas and I need to start slaughtering cows on site for the freshest beef.",

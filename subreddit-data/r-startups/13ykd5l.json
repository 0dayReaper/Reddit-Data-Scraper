Of course it will be mvp first. But planing to try funding and attend some programs with my start up. My question is there will be any problem with funding if start up is build on no-code platform?",

If you need anything moderately complicated then no-code will break down too easily. Maybe it\u2019s fine for a prototype to get a product out there for testing but I wouldn\u2019t really consider it viable as a true MVP. Remember that MVP is not the same thing as prototype.",

If you can create traction with whatever solution you came up with then for Angels and preseed you have proven you can find problem-solution fit. \n\nMost investors will most likely ask you to explain how you plan to transition to a mvp and how you think about your tech in terms of competitors etc. \n\nSo I dont think there will be a problem as long as you have a plan for how and why you can move to a v1.",

            "comment": "u/Remarkable_Belt_9317\r Building a startup on a no-code platform can be a viable option, especially for entrepreneurs with limited technical expertise or resources. No-code platforms provide intuitive interfaces and pre-built tools that enable the creation of software applications without traditional coding. They can help expedite development, reduce costs, and empower non-technical founders to bring their ideas to life. However, it's important to assess the scalability and customization limitations of the chosen platform, as well as its compatibility with your long-term goals. Evaluate the trade-offs between the speed of development and flexibility, and consider transitioning to a custom-coded solution if necessary as your startup grows.",

Definitely helps to work through the idea which you'll need to do so build an effective MVP, but it's not going to get you to Seed funding or anything - might be enough if you've got a good relationship with investors who will give you money on a concept, but then it you're at that point a napkin drawing is probably the same.",

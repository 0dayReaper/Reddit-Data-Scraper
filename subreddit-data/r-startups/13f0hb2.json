I have spent the last five months bootstrapping a technology product and recently secured $800K in prelaunch contracts. Now that the business is more derisked, I've decided to fill five initial roles to increase bandwidth and scale the product. I'm offering 7.25% of total shares across the five hires:\n\n*Marketing-0.25%*\n\n*Engineering-2.50%*\n\n*Sales-2.00%*\n\n*Frontend Design-0.50%*\n\n*Product-2.50%*\n\n**The question:**\n\nIt may be premature, but I want to be sure I'm not compromising a Series A by using the wrong incentives with my founding team. That said: Is 7.25% too little/too much to give away to a founding team in this situation, or does this even matter?",

Hyper growth and IPO?\n\nI believe your company might perform better with a highly motivated team who can see the worth (even if illiquid) of their equity grow as they execute on the vision, marrying value for your users with a care for the fundamentals of the business in which they all own a sizable stake.\n\nIf they are under-incentivized, it will come back to you in asks for salary, more equity, or simply a lack of care since they don't stand to benefit from growth. Maybe I'm jadded. I'm not fond of the VC path. I prefer small business vibes, where everyone who is *actually* hands on keyboard is in it to win it.\n\nI would rather grow slowly with an engaged and ownership-minded team. The builder \"energy\" might be better (synergy?!). This kind of energy might slowly vanish when people aren't incentivized enough.\n\nTLDR: Give them as much as you can and hire the best people you can possibly find.\n\nBut that's just me... there is more than one way to go about it.",

            "comment": "Marketer here. I would never, ever jump at 0.25% at your company's stage, especially since I know there's typically around 10 points in the pool, and 2 - 3 hires before me. I'm usually the first marketing hire, and I'd be the primary reason the company will make it to an A, and definitely a B considering how growth is the determining factor and building a good team is critical.\n\nI speak from experience here, too. I've worked with over 30 startups as a consultant, or \"hired gun\" in pre-seed, seed, A, B and one C. and I've been doing this for over 20 years. I rarely take W2 offers, because I can make a lot more and completely de-risk the equity equation, but I see the offers. I negotiate them and we typically agree to move the consultant (1099) route.\n\nFor startups that are pre-seed without a priced round, I ask for 2% - 4% and around $100k/yr. I'm looking explicitly for par value shares that will vest, and that I can exercise before the round becomes priced (for tax purposes, of course)\n\nFor startups that have raised a seed and the round has been priced (this is you, I assume) I ask for 2% and $140k/yr. Accelerated vest (2 years) on pro-rata (monthly vest) - and yes, I've had plenty of pushback on the vesting schedule and the 2%, but the best offer I've been given was 1.5% vested equally over 24 months. \n\nIf the company does not have a priced round (which is hit or miss at this stage) and shares are still at par value, I will want to vest &amp; exercise the par value grant ASAP and am willing to lower my salary to pre-seed levels ($100k) to get that deal done.\n\nOn a Series A, assuming you're post-raise, 0.25% is a standard offer, I just personally wouldn't take it and turn it down every single time. I'm going straight for the money, and that's $200k/yr or higher.\n\nIt took me over a decade to learn this, but there's very little value to joining a startup in the A round because those companies can't afford above-market salaries and can't afford to give out equity from a pool that needs to feed 10 - 20+ people. It's like the perfect storm of a dead end in 99.9% of the companies, and the companies that do exit via IPO, well, if you know who they're gonna be, please let me know, I'll adjust my rates accordingly!\n\nOn a Series B I would definitely take that split, and would expect a minimum $200k/yr salary. Unfortunately, I have yet to see an offer sheet with this equity comp at a B, but the cash comp is always there. \n\n\\---- \n\nMost founders will vehemently disagree with what I've just written. I'm probably their worst nightmare because I negotiate very hard to get my ideal terms, but in the end, marketers seem to be the people that historically get the worst end of the deal and that's thanks to YC and other VC-based incubators, or even direct investors themselves, that set these hard stops on a cap table for what they'll allow portfolio companies to budget for X employee and how much equity should be allotted for specific roles.\n\nIf this were pre-Google IPO times and the tax rules hadn't changed so drastically, I'd be OK with taking less equity to ride a rocket ship because the payout is higher in the end, but that's not the case. I wish it was. I would love it if every startup had great odds to exit, and those with equity stakes could get out with long-term cap gains, however the reality is that most startups in your exact stage are going to fail, most will never make it to A, and very few make it to B. \n\nThose are tough odds. Not saying you can't succeed, for all I know, you probably will, I just wanted to make it clear I have to think like this or I end up accepting lower equity, handcuffed over 4 + sub-market cash comp. \n\nI urge you to consider raising that 0.25% to at least 0.5% as it really feels insulting when you're in my place. You know what most cap tables look like and an offer like this at a pre-A just feels like you're an afterthought, and sadly, probably are.",

That said: The hope is that there's adequate bandwidth there for me to step away to focus on product vision (and eventually raising Series A). Practically, that means 5-6 engineers (one of which has led a couple of teams at high valuation growth stage companies) navigating product development alongside me and one other PM. As an aside: I'm also anticipating everyone on the early team to be involved with product development, but you flagging it as a concern has me thinking about whether I'm taking the wrong approach...perhaps there's room for one more technical PM?",

I'd generally go for aggressive revenue shares, not equity at this stage (and I'm 90% sure the profile of person you're looking to hire will want that.)  eg 20% for a one-year contract with a 5% incentive if over quota and a 5% incentive if multiyear.\n\nNB: this will feel expensive, but you will be super aligned: sales is cash-flow positive.  And if they sell, they get paid (but so does the company).  Initial quota will be hard to figure out esp if you don't have SDRs yet (though you should get them immediately; great AEs are generally not going to be interested in doing sourcing, and that's not a good way to spend their time.)\n\nSee eg Jason Lemkin's thoughts on comping your first salesperson [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/framework-your-first-saas-sales-comp-plan-jason-m-lemkin)\n\nIf you have enterprise sales -- the $15m ones -- I'd make those founder sales only, perhaps with a sales coach driving sidecar.  My take is if your company succeeds, that's a core skill to have in house and for a founder to do.",

Generally, I'd have one pm per 1-2 eng teams, with the determination there how involved the pm has to be.  If a team is product/frontend, probably one pm per team; if there's a ton of infra/backend, there may not be fulltime pm load. \n\nSeparately, there's two models for PM+eng collaboration, and you kind of have to figure it out, bec you'll hire different people.  One is very product-focused eng who regularly talk directly to customers; another is where PMs are doing more of that load and eng spend more time writing code w/ less direct customer exposure.  I tend to favor the latter, because onboarded eng time is super expensive and likely one of the scarcest resources in your company.  That said, you need the PM to have a good head on his/her shoulders re: not just product but also rough eng effort in this model.",

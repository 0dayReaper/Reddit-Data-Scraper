    "postText": "Some context it's 3 of us in the early stages of team formation. We've been working together for about a month. We recently won a grant and as part of the grant we're intended to meet at the granting organization's event. There's a secondary phase of the grant that'll transition to a contract with the organization. \n\nOne cofounder, is planning to join via zoom as he's too busy and told us far ahead of time of his intentions. And I figured it'd be fine since 2 out 3 of us will attend. However, now the 2nd cofounder unexpectedly needs to excuse himself for a work event. I'm not sure what to do, we have flights booked and the event planned. Realistically we only really need to be at the organizations event for 3 hours just for an early AM networking session. \n\nI'm not sure why the unexpected excuse all of the sudden, and what this means for the team. It seems like he's just nervous or worried. I feel like if we don't show face at the event, then we'll look ridiculous as a team since I've already told the org 2 of us will be attending. What do I do in this situation - especially considering that we're early team formation stage. I only really need him to be at the event for an hour and I'm not sure why he can't make an excuse from work for light networking.",

If you can\u2019t communicate effectively as a team, it may look bad for anyone external, including investors. You may also not survive in the long term. \n\nWhy are all three of you needed for the grant anyways? Can\u2019t one person accept it and network on behalf of the others?",

It's general open networking and it would be a good way to show our potential/skills by interacting with team members from the org. \n\nWhat I'm getting at, it seems like he's not committing to the team and making an excuse to not participate in a pretty straightforward responsibility. The networking session is in two days and I feel like a last minute change like this could have been either 1. fought back more from his end, and 2. A soft excuse to not participate (only an hour of his time would really would have been needed). Still badgering him to attend, but ghosted. \n\nI'm working with my 3rd cofounder to see whether he'd be able to come in person instead of a zoom call. I'm just a bit surprised at the unexpected pull back when we worked for a month - with good early traction.",

Sure.\n\nIs it a make or break moment that will drive you on to success beyond imagination if 2 out of 2 attend or break you into nothingness and abject failure if only 1 out of 2 attend? No.\n\nDon't let something as small and petty as a networking event cause a rift between you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: of course, if it really is a make or break moment and you guys will shut down next week if only 1 out of 2 attends then it's probably worth badgering some more :D",

I find that decision process endlessly exhausting as you rarely have enough information. But not giving up because of exhaustion is exactly where founder's energy is required. It is easy to have the wrong energy and just bullheadedly stick to one plan when a pivot is required, or conversely to not give in to a tempting pivot and squander progress to the original priority. And, as I said, rarely with all the information you need for a confident decision. \n\nWhere founder's energy is usually bad is in horrible bloated bureaucratic organizations because it is obvious as to what is broken and people can't get off their asses to fix it. This is soul destroying for founder types; which is why they either quickly leave these organizations, or knew from day one they would never fit in and thus never joined.\n\nThen some founders make the mistake of bringing in people from said organizations and they don't work well with the founders. This is where many optimistic founders make a mistake. They think these people with no get up and go can change. This is a case where the most successful founders have just enough mean in them to shove these people overboard as soon as they are identified. Too much mean is bad, too little is worse.\n\nWhere I find the worst founders with lots of energy come from are the same organizations. They think that 18 hour days are the only way forward; all they are doing is replicating their old shitty bureaucratic job but with a toxic type-a approach. This is why I said a good founder is one who can figure out the correct priorities. People working at a startup with clear priorities tend to also have a zest for what they are doing.",

You can explain you're the one in charge of representing the company at deals like this. I don\u2019t know if you've incorporated, but maybe you should be the CEO, or CFO if reasonable.\n\n Plus now is a good time to set founder roles, share vesting, amount of work required etc. You can come up with an agreement that you have a default number of shares at the beginning e.g. 10% each and pay each other x% of the company per hour or y% per investment amount brought in. These would help align ownership with effort. These are just some ideas. Whatever you do, ideally sort these things out now at the beginning. \n\nGood luck and wish you all the best at the event. Congratulations on the grant. :)",

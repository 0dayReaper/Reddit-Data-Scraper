I don't want to say what the idea is exactly. I've spoken with randoms in YouTube and twitch chat as well as a couple streamers and 8 out of 10 like the idea and would use it.\n\nI cannot create this on my own and will need to hire developers to help me. I can get a very basic MVP up, but it will be very simple and dumbed down.\n\nIs there a book or course I can take/read on how to go from this idea, to taking steps in making it real, along with getting investors to help? Not even sure how I could find an investor. I'm just a programmer. Help. Thank you.",

It might take some time, but it\u2019ll test your conviction around the idea. \n\nMost critically, find people willing to work with you and provide feedback as you build.",

I want to sponsor streamers to use it for a week and hope it'll grow organically after that. So either way I'll need money at some point. I think I'm more worried about the legal side to everything, how to do it all officially and gain investors to launch the product.",

Often times what users say they want, isn't often what they want, or at a price they're willing to spend. \n\nSo, let's say you get the mvp running. The next step, or honestly the step you should have done after getting feedback, is to have tried to get those who gave you the feedback to sign up for the mvp when done. And unless you're absolutely sure that growth matters more than income (which honestly only applies for social media related companies) for the business, try to generate income immediately.",

It could be mockups or wireframes. \n\nRemember, speed wins and you\u2019re just trying to get people to show intent to use your product.\n\nWhile you\u2019re building, start chatting on Twitter, linkedin, and attending networking events. \n\nIf you\u2019re not networked, this is your best opportunity to contact investors. Eventually you will gain the trust of some VCs and they\u2019ll introduce you to other VCs. Raising capital is about building relationships. \n\nStart marketing before you have an mvp, collect those emails, keep in touch. Use them later to acquire paying users as quickly as possible, then ask them for feedback and iterate.\n\nYou can get paying users before shipping your MVP if you're savvy. \n\nKeep in mind, unless you\u2019re networked or have proven experience, most investors won\u2019t touch you unless you have traction. \n\nBut your primary focus today should acquiring users in some form as quickly as possible. Hiring, raising capital, and the roadmap isn\u2019t important at the idea stage. \n\nIf you\u2019re not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you\u2019ve launched too late. Good luck.",

    "postText": "We want to serve native ads in our mobile app. We have several places in the app where we can serve native looking ads. We don't want to use Google Ads. Advertisers can contact us and buy a place in the app for a period, say 1-3, days or 7 days etc. We don't want to charge based on clicks but just a fixed price at first. We can do the first ad space selling with Google Forms, but this is not scalable. We can also build this platform ourselves, but that costs time etc. So we are looking for an ad server platform which is scalable, flexible and has a pricing scheme that had a low starting fee since we are students and don't have like 3k we can spend in the beginning.So what are our options here? And does anyone have any advise on how to tackle this?Thanks in advance.",

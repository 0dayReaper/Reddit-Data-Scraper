It was actually free and still till now. We got like 4k user and we need to register it as a company. The problem now that to make our product paid it should be improved and this gonna cost much money. So it\u2019s so risky. \n\nI just was asking how I can know from the users and analytics I got that the improved version gonna make alot of money or it is just a waste of time. You guys have idea about that? And who I shall talk to?",

Do some discovery conversations, find out what they like about your product and what they would pay for.\n\nPick the most frequently requested feature and put it behind a paid tier. You can build from this. \n\nSome people might say that you should just start charging your 4000 users. Or maybe create a free tier and a paid tier using some limit so that those using your tool the most have to pay for it.",

Also to know how they are using your product because that will open more paths to where you need to develop. \n\nThis could be done in several ways like surveys, paid surveys 10$ gift card, website hotspots etc etc the goal is to find what is good and bad about your software. \n\nOnce you know good, you promote it to get more subscribers and when you find out bad you fix it to retain. \n\nYou can also look into competitor solutions and see the difference yourself. \n\nDon't hire anyone to do these jobs. If you can find a smart and/or experienced person then make him a partner in your business. Also beware of people who will tell you that your product has zero value and then will try to buy it from you for very cheap",

In this case these sellers are way above average.\n\nShould I charge proportionally to the number of sales?  Or just do a flat rate across all users?",

I\u2019ve noticed that about 15% to 25% of the money saved (assuming they understand and agree on that value) is all you can get people to pay and renew. \n\nBut hey, give higher percentages a go in your validation process. What you\u2019re looking for is nC x nQVP &gt; all alternatives. C = customers who acquire QVP = quantified value proposition.",

I know price tiering helps capture more of the value,  So I'm consider that as well (based on their usage), but  that increases the complexity for the customer.  i.e. Its not simple anymore.",

That way you end up with stable subscription revenue rather than fully variable revenue with makes things easier from a cash flow perspective, while still having the opportunity to charge \u201cover-use\u201d at a higher rate per sale than in the fixed package. That gives you upside and provides an incentive for customers to upgrade to the next package on the ladder if they\u2019re consistently over-using",

So I may even include a free tier.  \n\n\nI'm thinking of just keeping things simple (for the MVP) and having 1 price.",

I used to work for a company that sold software and services to estate agents and this was a challenge for everyone else in the sector (we were luckily enough to be the ones that had the distribution, so they came to us)",

    "postText": "Hello, I am about to start a service based startup and I have the business plan and other relevant documents ready. I am not able to make a decision whether I should go for an incubator or DIY? I approached an incubator and they are asking for 2% equity and being a part of an incubator also means that I have to follow the deadlines and schedules they set for my company which I am not very comfortable with. But on the other hand being a part of an incubator does benefit in several ways as well. So I am on the fence here. Can anyone help me make a choice?",

            "comment": "If you can you should go for where your customers are, and they are rarely among other broke startups looking for resources.\n\nIncubators can be like an office space where you get to stay for free as long as the very passive owners think you might produce a major payday for them. So you'll get absolutely zero help unless your business is already about to make it big, or you're a personal friend of theirs (or their network).\n\nBut, some incubators are good, and exactly what a particular aspiring entrepreneur need to get going.\n\nIf the incubator will result in paying customers, and DIY is less likely to succeed, then it's a good option. But you're the one that must decide that.\n\nIt's just a tool. Make sure it's useful one, and not a distraction.",

This makes it hard for me to commit any part of my day to anyone or anything, if on top of that, I also am made to meet my incubators deadlines then I won't have any time for actually building my brand the way I envision it.",

The decision to go for an incubator or DIY approach depends on your personal preferences, goals, and resources.   \nIf you are looking to grow rapidly and gain access to resources and mentorship, joining an incubator might be a better option. If you prefer to work at your own pace and have complete control over your startup, the DIY approach may be a better fit.  \nIf you lack experience in certain areas such as marketing, sales, or finance, an incubator can provide you with mentorship and resources to help you overcome these challenges. On the other hand, if you have the necessary skills and resources, you may be able to succeed on your own.  \nIf you are confident in your ability to raise capital on your own, you may prefer the DIY approach. Incubators can provide access to funding opportunities and help you raise capital, but they will require equity in your company.",

I am a product designer by profession and a Robotics Engineer by degree. Apart from this I also have experience in project management, corporate finance,  data analytics, digital marketing, google/meta ads, pricing strategy, etc till now when I was in the growing stages before I registered my startup I was the only person running the show, doing the taxes and everything. Now that I have a business plan in place, I want to scale up which will require many employees and capital.\nTo raise the capital needed I am also working a full-time job which means I 6 be able to commit to my incubator demands and deadlines. That's where I am in a dilemma. Whether I should quit my job that's paying me well and work on my startup full-time with an incubator and give them 2% or move ahead with things the way they are untill I break out of the matrix and then leave my job and focus full-time on startup.",

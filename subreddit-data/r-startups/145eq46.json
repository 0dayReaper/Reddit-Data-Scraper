Todays day and age you want true followers that will use word of mouth to continue to generate followers to your page and interest in your product.",

Basically regular people who are good at highlighting a product but they are a neutral party that can post from a users view and you can use the content for your page, ads etc their budget can be anywhere from gifting (free) to 100, 200, 300. Theres quite a range",

Ensure that your content is unique and compelling, post regularly, and use relevant hashtags and geotags. Look for and follow users who share your interests. If this seems overwhelming, you can hire a service to help. Agencies like Ascendviral offer these services and come highly recommended by many users here.",

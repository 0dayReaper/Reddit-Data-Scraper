    "postText": "\nSEC Adopts Rules to Facilitate Smaller Companies\u2019 Access to Capital\n\nWashington D.C., March 25, 2015 \u2014 The Securities and Exchange Commission today adopted final rules to facilitate smaller companies\u2019 access to capital.  The new rules provide investors with more investment choices.\nThe new rules update and expand Regulation A, an existing exemption from registration for smaller issuers of securities.  The rules are mandated by Title IV of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act. \n\nThe updated exemption will enable smaller companies to offer and sell up to $50 million of securities in a 12-month period, subject to eligibility, disclosure and reporting requirements. \n\n\u201cThese new rules provide an effective, workable path to raising capital that also provides strong investor protections,\u201d said SEC Chair Mary Jo White.  \u201cIt is important for the Commission to continue to look for ways that our rules can facilitate capital-raising by smaller companies.\u201d\n\nThe final rules, often referred to as Regulation A+, provide for two tiers of offerings:  Tier 1, for offerings of securities of up to $20 million in a 12-month period, with not more than $6 million in offers by selling security-holders that are affiliates of the issuer; and Tier 2, for offerings of securities of up to $50 million in a 12-month period, with not more than $15 million in offers by selling security-holders that are affiliates of the issuer. Both Tiers are subject to certain basic requirements while Tier 2 offerings are also subject to additional disclosure and ongoing reporting requirements.\n\nThe final rules also provide for the preemption of state securities law registration and qualification requirements for securities offered or sold to \u201cqualified purchasers\u201d in Tier 2 offerings.  Tier 1 offerings will be subject to federal and state registration and qualification requirements, and issuers may take advantage of the coordinated review program developed by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA).\n\nThe rules will be effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.\n\n###",

The seller knows the worth, the buyer can't figure it out reliably.\n\nIn the VC world, VCs will raise a fund from limited partners (rich folks, sometime institutions, etc) and use their expertise to dig into companies to try to make educated bets.  They are, in effect, removing information asymmetry from the market for post-angel companies and connect limited partners with companies needing funds.  Angels typically do the due diligence themselves and invest directly themselves.\n\nThis ruling brings the requirement to be rich down, but that also, by necessity, brings the transaction size down.  Since the transaction size is small it's much more difficult to justify investing the time in due diligence.\n\nIn such a market the buyer has one primary defense: buy low.  Since buyers are (rationally) only willing to buy low, you only get sellers with product that's of low value.  Then you have a market for lemons. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons)\n\nHow do you fix this.  1.  Trusted third party vouches for the quality or provides independent information on quality (like carfax).  2.  The seller can use signals to broadcast the quality of the good.  Signals like warranties are common. (100K mile bumper to bumper).  [More on signaling here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_%28economics%29).\n\nIn this case, I'm not sure signaling can solve the problem because the startup, almost by definition, won't have the resources to properly signal and it's unclear whether Joe Investor could properly interpret the signals anyway.\n\nI think you're left with the trusted third-party route.  If I were seriously looking at this problem, I'd carefully consider whether it was better for the startup to do the verification (and maybe take on risk, deal with licensing and legal, and potentially face scalability challenges) or if it was better to provide an information exchange mechanism as part of a broader kickstarter-like investment platform.\n\nEDIT:  Seriously, a new market just sat down beside you and asked if it could buy you a drink.  What do you do?",

We'd be very interested in getting feedback from any of you about our process and are always seeking better ways to reduce these risks.\n\nWe are a registered broker-dealer with the SEC, which means that we have extremely high compliance requirements for advertising, employee licensing, bad-actor background checks, data security, audits, and more. We try to go the extra mile with our background checks, rejecting founders and investors with backgrounds with any hint of questionable behavior, even if they haven't broken any securities laws. Our regulations require us to share disclosure documents, which describe the risks faced by each company, allowing investors to have a balanced view of each offering. \n\nFrom what I can tell spending time in Silicon Valley over the years, it appears that some of the discouraging wealth disparity there exists because a select group of employees and investors has had access to equity in great companies, while the rest of the population is shut out. With the SEC's carefully crafted protections in place for non-accredited investors, hopefully more small-time investors will have access to high quality, medium to pre-IPO -sized companies. If such companies are willing to accept many non-accredited investors in Reg A+ offerings, they will need a regulated entity, like a broker-dealer, to help them.\n\nIn any case, I'd be grateful to hear your feedback.

They do a limited sell of of shares and then use it to bring the VC and Investment Banks to the honeypot.\n\nI'm no expert but one things for sure:\n\nThe playbook done' changed.\n\n* ALL ABOARD THE BUBBLE TRAIN CHOOO CHOOO",

Then once it's established and easy, the fraudsters may come in, but I don't think they're the ones who will pioneer this new frontier.",

They bring connections and industry expertise. They help the business grow and help shape the strategic vision for the company. Later on, they can facilitate a good exit either by reaching out to other VCs for a buyout or working to help the startup get ready for IPO.\n\n2. A Smaller Set of Experienced Stakeholders: A lot of VCs understand that businesses Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat take time to mature into real businesses. While some of them (especially ones who got on board early) may have an accelerated exit, these guys, for the most part 'get it' and are understanding of elongated timelines AND the inherent risks in investing. By getting all your money from one or two VCs, you also have fewer voices at the table, making it easier to have a better investor-business relationship.\n3. Validation: There are bad VCs out there and idiots who cannot distinguish Uber from Color, but if you get an investment from a good VC it's validation that your idea has legs. \n4. VCs are Diversified: They know you're pretty likely to fail, so all their eggs aren't in your basket. That means that while they'll support you, they also understand when unpredictable market forces sink your business.\n\nCrowd funding is the exact opposite. You're dealing with a horde of people who (generally) aren't knowledgeable about building businesses. You have a million voices at the table telling you what to do. You have completely unrealistic expectations about your success -- 80%+ of startups fail. Most causal investors look at that stat and say, \"yeah, but THIS ONE will be one of the 20% that doesn't.\" Moreover, the average person won't be invested in 5, 10, or 20 startups. \n\nTaking money for equity should always be about more than just the dollars. VCs brings a lot more to the table than crowd funding ever will.",

In fact, the quality of the VC leading the round is a key part of how people assess a deal. When the crowd invests alongside multiple VCs, you get the best of both worlds. \n\nThat said, there are a few interesting advantages that a company with investment from the crowd will see:\n\n1. Connections: The sorts of people who invest in tech startups online are generally well connected successful professionals. Having over 100 people with a vested interest in your success means that you always have someone to call on when you need an introduction.\n\n2. Advocates: As well as mini-angels, some of your investors might be early-adopters of your product. Allowing your customers to become investors is a master growth hack and gives you an unfair advantage over the competition. \n\n3. Validation: It's suprisingly hard to get a large number of people to actually pony up and invest in a startup. If you can persuade people to invest then that is a useful validation of the idea, the product and the team. ",

But if you're going to invest in startups, then you really need a minimum of 10 for even basic diversification and more is better. But obviously that means placing a larger number of smaller bets, not putting more in total into high risk investments than you can afford. http://www.disruption.vc/blog/diversification-for-angel-investors",

Where the fund pools a bunch of money from investors and then makes a wide spread of investments? And tracks them and gives them guidance? \n\nIt would be much more interesting to see some innovative VC funding vehicles get opened up to the general public. It just doesnt make sense for Avg. Joe to try to invest in one or 10 startups then just hope something comes back. In my opinion anyway.\n\nNon-accredited investors have always been able to invest in startups (see rules 505 and 506 of SEC Reg D). It seems this new ruling just loosens up the solicitation restrictions and the cap of investors per company.",

Our preference would be senior even mezzanine debt, the problem is though from what I see, very few VCs want to invest in debt.

How is it any different than someone being able to purchase public traded company stock themselves? The point being that people can ultimately spend their money how they choose. It will be up to the mediums and crowdfunding platforms that host these startups to get the message across that this type of investing is highly volatile and risky because it is so early stage. ",

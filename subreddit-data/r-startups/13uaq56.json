    "postText": "Are you folks working with Indian (or elsewhere) devs from Freelancer.com/Fiverr?  Wondering because someone recommended on a recent post here to make your first startup hire a senior tech person at a rate of over $200k/year.  My developer is going for a $2,500 MVP in 8 weeks though he\u2019s in India.   \n   \nHe has made an app for me before (was much more expensive @ $10k) and we both learned lessons regarding working together on that failed adventure (failed because I didn\u2019t have scope control or a low cost marketing plan).  So in my case, I know I can get a working app on the App Store.  \n   \n  What problems might I run into if the app gets any traction?  What other risks am I taking by hiring internationally?",

He needs to be invested in the app.\n\nNow, I question the ability of international freelance developers, but that is a different question.  It sounds like this guy has already delivered, so that might actually eliminate that problem.",

Make sure they understand that you\u2019re paying them for 40 hours a week. They may still take other work, but maybe add a second contractor on the task as well to de risk. It\u2019s more than 10X cost saving if you can manage the development yourself.",

Once people start to use your app, they will give UI/UX feedback. \n\nFor the first step, these are sufficient. You can add other details once you get data from these tools.",

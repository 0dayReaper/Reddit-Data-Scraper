Would you personally develop the app or hire a freelancer? Do you establish a company prior to development or wait until the app gains traction? Considering that the basic idea isn\u2019t technically challenging, what would the marketing strategy look like? What kind of market research should be conducted, if any? I\u2019m trying to understand the entire entrepreneurial process post-idea generation. Any insights, experiences or resources would be greatly appreciated.",

And you can't say, \"its a chat thing that everyone will use\" - it never happens that way. You have to find a niche to start with and truly understand their challenges, and perhaps most importantly, their language. If you don't understand their language, you can't possibly create something that will appeal to them. How do they describe their problem? If you don't know who they are, you can't possibly create a marketing plan that will work. Only until you truly understand these things will building and marketing it make any sense. \n\nIf you build it and hope it \"gets traction,\" without knowing who the customer is, what they need, and their language, you'll just end up on the failed startup stat sheet.",

I envisage two possible directions for our ongoing discussion. Firstly, we could proceed with me providing answers to the posed questions (who is it for, what problem it solves etc.), opening them up to your agreement or critique, thereby refining my responses. Alternatively, we could follow a different path. Under this scenario, I assert that I possess clear and concise answers to these questions and you accept this premise at face value. Our discourse then progresses to 'what comes next.' What if I indeed have satisfactory answers to all these questions? I'm inclined towards the latter option. Do you perceive this as a feasible route? Regardless of the chosen direction, I sincerely appreciate your time and thoughtful analysis on this matter.",

Freelancers are great if they fill a skill you don't have. It is critical to have a well-defined spec for them to use, otherwise you do many cycles with them revising from V1 to V2 to VX until you have something you like. Specs save time and money. Specs also force you to think through features and architecture.\n\n**Business Entity.** Start with a company name and grab the corresponding domain for a web site. Consider doing a \"Coming Soon\" page or \"Alert me When It's Ready\" page. At the bottom of these pages put your copyright. Even though you don't have copyright filed at this point, by posting it publicly it establishes first use with the copyright office. This is a U.S. comment, other countries might be different. Don't build a full website at this stage. Do the entity formation (LLC, Inc.) when you are further along. You'll know when it's time.\n\n**Market Research.** If you have an app idea, do a brainstorm on who you \\*think\\* it might appeal to. For example, do you think it solves a problem for young mothers? People who want a new SnapChat but with super strong privacy? Sports fans? When you think about who, think about their socio economics, psychographics, and demographics such as age, race, and education levels. Once you know who, then you need to talk with them. How you do that (there are many potential tactics), is dependent on who they are and where they hang out, both online and offline. But start small - if your target is young moms, go talk with 5-8 moms and listen to what they have to say. Take 'em out for a coffee and keep it casual. Don't pitch your idea, just ask about their problems. After that, you'll need to expand and talk with more moms with refined questions about what the first conversations told you. I highly recommend the book, \"The Mom Test\" by Rob Fitzpatrick. It is a \"how to\" manual on how to conduct customer research and is loaded with actionable tactics. \n\n**Marketing.** Here's some basic fundamentals. Inbound marketing, where you provide value to attract people to your offering is evergreen and likely should be a core part of your plan. All of your language, in emails, on your website, etc. needs to be about them, and not about you. Nobody gives a crap about you and your app. They only care about easing their pain. When the time comes, hiring a good freelance copy writer might well be worth it. Assume that you will be spending little or nothing on paid advertising. It is hard to get paid advertising to provide good ROI unless the offering generates substantial revenue. Once you know \"who,\" that will tell you \"where.\" Are they on TicTok? LinkedIn? Reddit? At soccer practice?\n\nHope it helps!",

Development is underway, and our objective is to have a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) ready by the end of the month.\n\nI've also secured a domain name, which is particularly exciting. According to the guidelines from GPT, it's brief, memorable, pertinent to the app's purpose, and spelled correctly. However, I haven't yet set up a landing page or a full website. It's encouraging to know that establishing an online presence might aid in the copyright process down the line. From your explanation, I understand that it's acceptable to develop the MVP before officially establishing the business entity.\n\nThe aspect of marketing is where I face a significant dilemma. Consider Snapchat as an example. Do you believe the creators of this app conducted formal market research beyond consulting with their friends, family, and immediate circle? I don't claim to know their process, but I'm genuinely curious if the approach of market study-based feature prioritization applies universally to all apps. I bring up Snapchat because its target audience and novelty bear considerable resemblance to the app I'm developing. It seems to me that this might be a case where the most useful feedback will come from users experiencing and interacting with the actual product, rather than pre-emptively articulating their needs without having seen it. I could be mistaken, so I'm eager for more input on this matter.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your thoughtful and comprehensive response. It's greatly appreciated!",

There are some famous examples of successful products that didn't do much research but they had the knowledge. Steve Jobs already knew that people loved a small mobile device that could play their music because the iPod was a hit. He also knew they wanted the internet on a mobile device. And the value of high res cameras and touchscreens was pretty self evident. So when he put all that together in the iPhone it was a hit. In this example, he already had the needed user knowledge to go forward. Prototypes are a great way to gather feedback. You can start with wireframes, then perhaps a simple app, and finally an MVP. But you can't legitimately say you can build an MVP unless you know the M and V.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;I'm just suggesting many roads can get you the necessary user knowledge.",

Once your MVP is released, you get feedback from the market, start to generate revenue from your product, and have to expand then hiring your own CTO and building a team under CTO will be more effective.\n\n\\- Hiring a freelancer is an easy job but managing that freelancer is challenging. In the initial stage, you should focus on developing a marketing plan, and business strategies instead of managing freelancers.\n\n\\- Until you need a legal entity for a different proposal, you don't need to start a company. It will save your other expenses in the early stage of your product. \n\nI have helped many startups to grow from their ideation stage to profitable businesses. And seen the business growth life cycle. These patterns helped me and startups a lot. \n\nThanks",

My plan was to develop the prototype and MVP myself(or using a freelancer) and release it to gather early feedback while operating as an individual developer. Given my background as a seasoned software engineer, I find the idea of employing a freelancer for the initial development phase to be quite feasible.\r  \n\r  \nOnce I had a tangible product that shows promise, my intention was to incorporate the business and shift focus towards marketing and branding. However, I've found from various sources that it might be more advantageous to form the company prior to developing the MVP.\r  \n\r  \nApple's policy complicates the switch from an individual to a business entity after an app has been published. Moreover, it appears that the app transfer process can be challenging. Also, there are potential complications with publishing the app under my personal developer account when the actual developer is a freelancer.\r  \n\r  \nAll these considerations suggest a multitude of potential issues if I don't establish a company at the beginning, which initially seemed like an unnecessary step. Therefore, my question is: what would be the most advisable course of action? What is the typical practice in such scenarios?",

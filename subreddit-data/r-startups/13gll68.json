    "postText": "What's a good approach when pricing against multiple currencies?\n\nLet's assume I offer a basic subscription to my product for \u00a329/month and I also want to target US and Europe customers.\n\nThere's 3 scenarios I'm thinking about:\n\n1. Convert the currency directly; \u00a329 =&gt; ~36.5$\n2. Set same number for all currencies; \u00a329 =&gt; 29$\n3. Set different pricing per currency (round up to 9s); \u00a329 =&gt; 39$\n\nWhat is most commonly used and what makes more sense?",

So the currency conversion method should be more correct and round it to the near 9 as you had suggested.\n\nKeeping 29 for each currency doesn't make sense because the sense of spending 29 would be different for different countries as there are significant differences between  values of the currencies.",

    "postText": "Hello folks,\n\nWe're currently raising cash for a little startup.\n\nInvestors are, rightfully, asking for some key metrics, including the famed EBITDA.\n\nOur business is, in large part, a rental business. We make products that we then rent. We depreciate these products over three years, as they get lost and deteriorate.\n\nIt seems to me that looking at our company through the EBITDA makes no sense, as this metric ignores the depreciation of our rental stock, which is a massive expenditure.\n\nDo you have thoughts ?",

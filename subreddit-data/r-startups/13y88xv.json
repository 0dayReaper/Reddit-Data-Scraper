    "postText": "**Context:** \n\nI'm a student nearing graduation with a B.S in computer science &amp; engineering. My focus is cybersecurity but I have practical industry and open-source experience in fullstack engineering, system administration, and software engineering with a large majority of my practical experience being fullstack and cyber. \n\nA friend I met a cyber convention who I keep in touch with and occassionally play games online with casually mentioned one day that he's been setting up a start-up in the background and pitched to me that he would like to hire me for a fullstack engineering position if possible; I essentially said I'll consider their offer.\n\n**Situation:**\n\nI am now actually considering their offer because my job search hasn't been successful at all. I currently work part-time remotely for another company but it's unclear if it will turn into a full-time position. While the job is fun and great experience, the current pay is not something I can make a proper living out of nor even a career in the long-term.\n\nSince the startup world is unknown territory, I generally have no idea what questions I should be asking beyond compensation. I don't really know how to ask questions that will give me a good idea on how to gauge the legitimacy and also work environment of a startup. In fact, because it was mentioned casually, I'm unsure if this is a side-gig type job, another part-time, or even a potential full-time position, let alone the expectations on both their side and my side.\n\nEven though they're are a good friend, I'm just cautious of what I might be getting into **so any advice and suggestions on how to approached and gauge their startup would be appreciated!!!!** thank you!!!",

Give it 100% and go for it. \n\nThe worst case is you can add all the entrepreneurial skills you learn along the way to your resume for the next company. \n\nKeep working PT if you can manage. Most ppl work 60-80 right out of college, so having some diversification of projects and income makes it a little less risky financially. When it comes to salary, ask all questions about the funding source and investors. Do more than your due diligence. \n\nLast thing I would do if I were in your position, no matter what happens with your job scenario, find a high caliber mentor. Find someone doing what you could see yourself doing in 5 or 10 years and meet/connect with them regularly.",

These details should be enough to make an informed decision. Of course startup is a risky venture, with these all you can decide how much of a risk you would like to take. all the best",

What is the problem they are fixing?\n2. How do they know this problem exists?\n3. Did they talk with other folks having the same problem? Are they willing to pay for a solution?\n4. Are there existing solutions out there? Why are others not using those?\n5. Why do you think they are suited for building a solution for this problem?\n6. How will be the compensation?\n7. Is he full time on this? If not, why not?\n\nAfter these answers, either post here again (feel free to DM me) or make decision yourself. Points to consider on the basis of those answers:\n\n* Is the solution that they are thinking 10x better than what exists? If no solution exists (or exists in a different market), then your answer is already yes. If something exists, is it really 10x better? --&gt; This makes the product rare\n* Is it a burning problem? (rely on point 3 answer above). If not, people are not going to pay to the startup to buy the solution. --&gt; This makes the product valuable\n* If the solution is not rare and valuable, it is not going to be a success.",

            "comment": "Hey, you're in a very tight spot, I went through something similar after I graduated a couple of years ago (the first job is always very difficult to land, and I can totally relate to how defeating it can feel). However, I think your cautiousness regarding the startup with your friend is wise. Here are a few suggestions on how to gauge the best option for you:\n\n**Set a Meeting:**  request a formal meeting with your friend to discuss the specifics of the salary, position, and startup. Treat it as a professional conversation, and ask questions openly as well as voice your concerns. Make sure to seek clarity on the nature of the job. Is it a part-time, full-time, or contract position? Understanding the commitment level will help you evaluate if it aligns with your long-term goals.  \n**Discuss compensation:** Money isn't everything, but it's important to ensure you can sustain yourself financially, as well as assess the potential for growth. Inquire about the compensation package, including salary, benefits, and any potential equity or profit-sharing opportunities. Also, make sure you understand the startup's vision and long-term goals. Ask about their business plan, target market, and growth strategies. This will give you an idea of their potential and stability.  \n**Seek information on funding:** It's crucial to understand the startup's financial situation. Ask about their funding sources, runway, and plans for future investment. This will help you gauge their stability and growth potential.  \nI know it may be uncomfortable to discuss these topics with a friend, but if you're planning on entering a professional relationship with them, it is super important. Hope this helps! whatever you chose to do, best of luck!",

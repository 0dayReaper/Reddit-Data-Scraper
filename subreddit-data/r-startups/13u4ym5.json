I'm looking to prototype some projects and want something can be consumer facing (login, web/mobile, ability to make pretty, cloud hosted)  but I would like something I can drop I to the code if needed to tweak on the edges if needed.\n\nAny suggestions? I tried googling it and got flooded with a lot of content marketing from old vendors. So hoping reddit might be better :)",

There's something almost inherent about low-code environments preventing you from getting full access to the code. If their UI could parse and change a certain bit of a code, you wouldn't need access to it. If you need to write code to control it, then their UI won't understand what you've done.",

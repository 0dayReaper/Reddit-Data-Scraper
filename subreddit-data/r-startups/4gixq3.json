    "postText": "#TL;DR\nMade a little over $25.00 in my mobile game with IAP and Ads as a one man show.  It *is* very **hard** to become successful in the gaming market for a single individual.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Background\nI write my games in Gamemaker - Studio.  \nMy wife suggested I make a post.  \nI build an android app called [Powerhouse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newleafstudios.powerhouse) that hit #63 on the top new free puzzle games for a while.  I tried and tried to get some reviewers to check it out, or youtubers to look at it.  I spent a good 3 weeks trying to market the crap out of my game.  To my surprise I got barely anything.  I tried advertising!  It worked, but its expensive, and I'm not a wealthy individual having a wife, 2 children and a cat to feed.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy first game was called [Splitball](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newleafstudios.splitballgame) - it was more or less a test project to figure out all the ins and outs of Google Play.  2 things I found out.  I **SUCK** at art - and people **HATE** permissions on apps.  So I nearly removed all permissions for my second game and took a route that didn't require any special art.  So I went with the puzzle genre, which I love.  Also, my father passed about 4 months ago and he was a **BIG** fan of puzzles, so I did it for him as well.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn total, I got just over 1000 downloads in total, 2 in-app purchases and a couple bucks from Ads.  But honestly, the best part is seeing the reviewers say that they enjoy the game.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Graph  \nI'm sorry, I have no graph for my revenue.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Honestly** I completely agree with all the things a certain person says, but what it comes down to!?  A lot of luck!  Obviously you need a good game to get anywhere, but let's face it... Its a *VERY* tough industry to get your foot in!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI made my game with love, and passion!  I still update it all the time! I enjoy it! :D  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPlease, proceed with caution!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n*EDIT:*   Wow my first gold!  Thank you kind stranger, and thanks for all the awesome feedback and comments you are all providing!  I am really enjoying discussing this with everyone and I am learning lot's from all of you!",

Its funny, I had a company approach me about building a mobile app which allows you to order food from your seat at sporting events.  They gave me drawings of what they wanted it to look like.  I built it and went to deploy it to the app store and there was an app with the same exact name, just one letter less with an almost identical setup.  They were freaking out and swear they didn't see that app there when they did their research.  So what they thought was an original and multimillion dollar idea...had already been done and had almost the same name and everything.",

I believe the current trend is simple, uniform colors shapes and clear letters - examples:\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bigduckgames.flow\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.balysv.loop\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gramgames.tenten\n\nIt seems as \"less in more\" is a very strong trend right now.\n\nSecond, in terms of marketing, I would look into gleam.io which is a fantastic giveaway/contest platform in which entries to the draw are earned by completing specific actions - it might be twitter follow, it might be app download. You can offer say a tablet or a smartphone as the prize and with a bit marketing of the contest itself you might be surprised how quickly you can build audience.\n\nLast but not least I would reach out to smaller streamers on Twitch.tv and offer them an incentive to either play your game on stream or promote it with stream graphics/text, etc. It can be a bit tricky but you can offer a $10 Google Play credit to the streamer to use as a giveaway in exchange for pushing your game for a month, etc.\n\nJust get creative and stay active - going to gaming forums and subreddits and posting screenshots/videos or even just an intro can go a long way.\n\nDon't give up - it will get better. Getting big in mobile gaming takes time and depends on 1000s of different factors.",

But it always depends on what their business model is. If it's all IAP, the key is to get a critical mass of users so that X% convert. If it's an app that's paid, it's typically better to try to pinpoint the customers, often through social media ads or media outreach to targeted publications. \n\nSometimes apps are add-ons to a bigger service, and in that case it's often about increasing conversions. There are a lot of things to do there, and we often recommend email for that objective. \n\nHope this helps! ",

It resolves one single pain: I am bored.\n\nSo, if you can promise and deliver fun, you have consumers.\n\nYou said that with 1000 downloads, you have some bucks. Then, you have a market. And if your money comes from ads, then you are in the ad business. \n\nNow, it is time to write the business plan and the marketing plan. In this case, it is almost the same.\n\nWhy somebody will pay for ads? what they get in return? people pay for ads because they get traffic. And probably, qualified traffic (for example, teenagers living in california with an iphone 6, that probably will buy some new triple A videogame in the future)\n\nSo, your business is to provide qualified traffic and monetize with clicks/impressions.\n\nHere, there are tons of possibilities.\n\nYou can make the numbers. Millions of downloads will pay bucks. Then make many puzzles superaddictive. More games, more time, more ads, more bucks. Make small versions and see what is more addictive and generate more visits. Try more levels, or longer levels. The important thing here is click on ads. More clicks and better paid ads.\n\nNot the dream for many developers. But this is only the top of the funnel. Those are casual gamers. You are looking for the bucks to finance the next level.\n\nThen build an email list.\n\nEmail list is the solid rock of digital marketing. Well, qualified databases. Email list is one type of qualified database. Your videogame can collect information from users and make another qualified database. Information like how many hours, their location, their phone model (in other words, their wealth)\n\nAsk players for their email. For example, you can send them a code for the next level direct to their email.\n\nThen you have a distribution channel.\n\nYou can send offers and preorders to your customers. You can show them your new games. More important, You can send them concepts for new games. You can make segments, like teenagers, females, newyorkers, whatever.\n\nThen you can invest in better content and in a brand. We go to the next level.\n\nAnd start again.\n\nThis is a basic, very basic, marketing plan. It assumes that you will monetize with ads. There are other ways to monetize, but I am not a particular expert in games.\n\nThe idea here is this: if you are your boss, you have to sell. This is the truth. In my case, it turned to be a great thing because I like it, but not everybody like it because you have to deal with the word: \"no\"\n\n",

And the only way to get that content is with their email. That is called a lead magnet.\n\nMove them from your casual game to a login form is not easy. So, you have to give a good reason to do it.\n\nRandom ideas:\n\n- after some great archivement, let them share their hiscore or save it.\n- create reports with stats that can be sent to their email\n- create special live events, like one day, it is the lunar festival, and the game has a kung fu theme. Let them receive alerts for it.\n- make a wordpress site and create a custom plugin for your game. Like the control panel for users.\n- let them customize their character with premium skins for subscribers.\n- let them save their inventory.\n- make some editor in your website where they can edit items from their game (and let them share!).\n- create a virtual world with an story about your characters, and create a website with some art. Let them download beautiful background for their mobile.\n\nIt really depends of your strategy, your target, your customers, etc.\n\nThank you for your question!\n",

            "comment": "Thanks so much for sharing! An app that hit top 100 in any charts is actually pretty good... in fact, it's REALLY good. As for the not making money part, that is a bit more complicated. One thing that is different between OP and the other poster are the two different platforms and market places. People on iOS generally spend more money than on Android, in terms of both apps and IAPs. An app that ranks at 100 on Google Play store won't compare to an app that ranks at 100 on the Apple App Store. A quick google search will show this easily ([Exibit A](http://9to5mac.com/2016/01/20/app-store-ios-downloads-vs-android-revenue/) and [Exibit B](http://www.androidauthority.com/google-launches-mode-watch-bands-for-android-wear-689377/)).\n\nFor a game to be successful, it has to be either insanely new and unique, or it has to be insanely polished, usually requiring lots of funding. The [poster from the other iOS game](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/4f74dv/quit_my_full_time_corporate_job_built_an_ios_game/) falls into the 1st category, while OP (and numerous other developers) don't fall into either. What that poster didn't discuss were his game design and story telling elements. He didn't explain *why* his game is popular, just showing to what extent it did get popular. And nobody asked anything about his design choices. I understand that people here aren't developers, but even as businessmen and entrepreneurs, you have to have a basic understanding of visual design for landing pages and logos, or understanding of how to write narratives for conveying ideas (his was a text-based game).\n\nA trend I've seen in successful and nonsuccessful game developers (I am a developer myself) is that the nonsuccessful ones usually focus only on how much they weren't successful, while the ones that rise to the top always identify their mistakes and do things better. If you look at OP, he actually realized that the art from his first game wasn't done well and that it held him back. So for his second game, he switched the reliance on art assets, and look at what happened... from zero to top 100! He also learned about how users feel about permissions, and probably a few more things he didn't openly discuss I'm sure. But the point is, it is possible to become better. Better through iterating. Much like what a lot of people preach here, right?\n\nOP, I hope you keep making games, and I hope you become successful one day. Good luck to you, brother!",

Make a MVP and see how it's going. If it gets traction maybe you build version 2, 3, etc, give some levels premium. If not, move on, but don't rely on it to make money unless it gets traction. Only then you can say that you should work 100% on it.\n\nThat's why I did in the past but with web apps. Just built something I wanted to use but didn't liked what already existed. I built many apps but only few got traction, then got some money from ads to sustain myself while I was preparing for a freemium model or something extra to buy on the side. It was the apps that I expected the least to make money. I also tried to build websites and apps in order to make money but always failed.\n\nFirst, build something that you would use. Test it for a while, improve it and build a nicer interface. Give it to the world, if it gets traction improve it further and claim the benefits of your hard work. If it does not get users, move on.

To answer your questions, no I don't run an email list for my game/company.  As far as building the userbase BEFORE release.  I bombed at this and did not take any steps.  I'm sure that wasn't such a good idea.  I put all my efforts into the marketing after that fact.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYes!  I would like to release more games.

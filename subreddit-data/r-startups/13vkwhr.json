    "postText": "As the title says, I am currently implementing a tribute system where the top 3 performing players receive tribute from cash prize tournament wins of lower ranking player wins, with the end goal of having the tribute system divided on competition types per video game.\n\nHowever, I was wondering if it would be best to have a more generalized system at launch, where the top 3 performing platform players/the top 3 performing players per competition type regardless of video game receive tribute so that I may account for the lower userbase at launch and then switch over to competition specific tribute systems.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Should I be consistent and let the tribute system be competition specific from launch or could the more generalized tribute approach help me grow faster in the beginning and then do a switcharoo?\n\nEdit: The winnings are in cash and the tribute is a % taken from the winnings pool",

Think of a tribute like a cut that the top ranking players get from the winnings of lower category players.\n\nPlayers compete in tournaments for prize money, and the winner always pays a small portion of their winnings to the highest ranking players in their competition category.",

How are founders dealing with feedback from users that says things like \"Oh there's already an app for your idea\"?\n\nI think having a competitive edge is crucial, but when you're starting out, it's hard for founders to create something that bigger companies with more engineers can't easily replicate.  \n\n\n\\*EDIT  \nOk well, 305 million startups is probably not accurate.

THey can't possibly build a clone or a similar thing to someone else that exists already. Why do we do this to ourselves?\n\nLook around your house or office right now? You probably see things like plates, pens, glasses, notepads of paper, water bottles, even cardboard coffee cup sleeves, clothing. You think only one company in each of those sectors builds that thing and only that single manufacturer is profitable? NO! Dozens, even hundreds of companies build and sell all of these things and maintain profitably. YOu go to a store and have OPTIONS for the thing you want to buy.\"\n\nEven Google, facebook, Uber, etc have OPTIONS. Don't like Google's privacy practices? Use DuckDuckGo or Bing or any other search engine. DOn't like Zuckerburg? Use Twitter or some other Social Media Platform. Don't like Uber? Call lift, a local bus, the subway, or a taxi. Options. Many are profitable. The ones who aren't go out of business, but not just because they had competitors.\n\nUnless there is LITERALY one single customer, the space you want to get into has enough potential customers for you to attract some away from your competition. Your job is just to find out how to do so successfully.",

Invention to some extent is overrated - most business value comes from copying existing solutions that already work, and improving upon them. Nonetheless, it's a distasteful practice to copy and often not usually officially sanctioned. More frequently done so, coyly.

So about 800 million of them if you extrapolate that out. It's actually likely over a billion as developing nations tend to have more small enterprise but that's a little harder to quantify.\n\nConsidering the old adages about most businesses failing and failing soon then it goes without saying that a large percentage of this number would be starting up.

Something new will come along every so often and force a large number of consumers or businesses to adapt. Retail computing, the internet, cloud computing are perhaps some examples. The Gartner Hype Cycle famously expresses this.\n\nNow, if you're competing at a stage when there are many apps already available, you're maybe too far down the cycle to be competitive. But, of course, if you're too early and the infrastructure isn't there to create a business in a reasonably lean manner, you'll also lose out.\n\nFinding the correct balance here in an intelligent, critical manner may be the the skills (and most likely luck) required to create a successful startup.",

I completely agree with you - having a competitive edge is definitely important when it comes to creating a successful startup. And you're right, it can be tough to differentiate yourself from other companies in the same market, especially when you're just starting out. \n\nOne thing that I think founders can do is really listen to their users. If people are saying that there's already an app for your idea, it might be worth taking a closer look at what those existing apps are offering. Are there any gaps or areas where they're falling short? If so, you could try to focus on addressing those gaps with your own app. Additionally, it could be helpful to really understand your target audience and their pain points, and try to build something that specifically addresses those needs. \n\nOf course, there's no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. But I think by staying agile, listening to feedback, and really understanding your users, founders can improve their chances of standing out in a crowded market. What do you think?",

More likely, someone invented it before and went out of business.\n\nOkay. So there is a thing about building a better mouse trap. Basically nothing you do at this point is going to be original, but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t work. Differentiate yourself.

That doesn't mean you can't compete.  But to echo another user in this thread, if said app or company is news to you, you might not have a very good idea of the competitive landscape.  So get out there, look over your competitors--- hell, you should even open an account with your competitors.  Get to know their strengths and weaknesses.  After you've reviewed it, you'll be in a much better position to release a minimum viable product.",

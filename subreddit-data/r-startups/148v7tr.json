    "postText": "I am helping launch a new self-storage site. Wanted to know if anyone has expereince with self-storage who has any tips and suggestions.\n\nA little background. It is being built in a new development. Phase two of 5 is under construction. Everything else around is an old industrial/commercial area. It is at the city's edge; nothing can be built on the other side due to the highway, waterway and other infrastructure. \n\nThe current plan is as follows. We have established a more engaging brand, self-storage is a commodity, but we are bringing a fun play to help elevate the experience. The main focus is on awareness and promotion for signups. This will be done with an easy-to-navigate direct website (surprising how many are clunky in the space) supported with FB Ads, Google Ads, &amp; SEO for traffic. Direct mailers to the new development that is built. Possible arrangement with realtors helping people move into the area or with the developer/s. There will be an incentive \"Grand Opening Special\" \"first time sing up deal\" etc. to fill the units. \n\nThe market here has strong demand, prices of competitors have increased in the time it took to secure &amp; develop the land. So the goal is to just get them filled for cashflow (client objective)\n\nAny experience, thoughts or suggestions are welcome!",

The thing I\u2019m wondering if the\u201cjuices are worth the squeeze\u201d in small batches\u2026no but large batches would be\u2026 I think. I don\u2019t much money or equipment or knowledge where to start. What would it take to start a syrup business like this in Ontario Canada?",

Large batches will need to be made by a manufacturer who will have minimum order quantities (MOQs). The bigger the order, the cheaper it is.\n\nWithout much money behind you, you might be unable to compete with existing products from big brands that sell their products much cheaper.\n\nAn alternative would be to build a \"luxury\" brand and sell at the higher end of the market where you can charge a premium price.",

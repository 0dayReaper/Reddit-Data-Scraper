    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not a happy ending story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## The beginning\n\nIt all started back in 2014. I had a startup whose clients were advertisers. It was a platform for users to review video ads in exchange for online points that could be redeemed for money or coupons. Watch and ad; rate it; be rewarded. Simple.\n\nAfter 100 campaigns I kept hearing it would be wonderful to connect their offline ads (e.g. TV ads, billboards, magazines, etc) with our platform. Advertisers wanted real insights and analytics from their offline advertising investment.\n\nAs dedicated founders we started working hard on this concept: \u201cfrom offline to online with your phone\u201d. Within 4 months we had our first version. I remember showing it to our friends and constantly hearing \u201cWow this is brilliant! It\u2019s like Shazam but for videos\u201d. I was ecstatic!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## The investment\n\nThe revenue was coming in but it wasn\u2019t recurrent. It was difficult to enter the yearly advertising budget. Advertisers assumed our platform as an experiment (mainly to get feedback) and not as a serious distribution channel \u2014 despite the fact we picked at 100,000 registered users.\n\nWe needed investment to grow and build the new technology\u2019s infrastructure. It wasn\u2019t cheap to maintain a technology that recognized millions of videos within 4s. More on this latter.\n\nIn 2015 we raised $0.5M from angels and led by a VC. This allowed us to grow our team to 7 members and accelerate product development.\n\nWe were ready to storm the world!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## The pivot\n\nIn retrospect, our product decisions after the investment killed our startup. We shifted our focus from the local videos ads review platform \u2014 where we had 100k users and 60 clients \u2014 to a global video recognition consumer product.\n\nWe created an App \u2014 like Shazam \u2014 that recognized millions of videos. Our goal was to have advertisers make their offline assets interactive and invite their audience to download our App and use it to unlock \u201csomething\u201d. The practical end was the same as the QR code. How cool is that? Scan a video and \u201c*magically\u201d* show related content on your screen? Exciting, right?\n\nWrong. Very few people downloaded the App. It turns out the barrier of downloading the App was too much for the reward (whatever the brand wanted to offer). Don\u2019t get me wrong, we did some cool campaigns with Kia, Unilever, or Volkswagen. But again these were one-shot campaigns. Basically an investment in innovation from the brands.\n\nAfter long days discussing our future, we thought of something. What if our technology was embedded in native apps like Snapchat, Facebook, IMDB, or even in the Operating Systems of mobile devices \u2014 Android and iOS? This would mean everyone could easily interact with their offline environment and get something in return. Brilliant!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Interactive The Walking Dead\n\nThis is now 2016 and we had a new strategy. White-label our technology and allow anyone to embed it in their platforms. We built SDKs for Web, Android and iOS and off we went searching for customers. One of our main goals was to have TV shows interactive. Allow viewers to point their phone to the TV and delight them with a new experience.\n\nIn this quest, I scrapped all my network, cold reach on Linkedin, went to conferences, traveled between London, New York and San Francisco. I ended up talking to all major TV networks \u2014 Comcast, BBC, FOX, PRISA, Viacom, CNN \u2014 and closed a contract with FOX. This was a pilot experiment where FOX would use Portugal as an assessment market. It took us 9 months (!) to close the contract.\n\nEven so, we started to see the light at the end of the tunnel. The worst part was over, we could take our learnings from our local pilot and catapult it to the world. We will change how people consume TV and will take our place in the TV innovation history.\n\nWe were ready to build a $1B company.\n\nAfter several negotiations with FOX we were able to add our technology to three shows: The Walking Dead, MacGyver and Prison Break. What a victory! All the major shows were interactive. FOX will advertise the shows are interactive, people will scan the TV and have an amazing, memorable experience. Win-win-win.\n\nWhen the first results started to come in\u2026 well let\u2019s take a detour first and come back to the results later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Entering Facebook\n\nDuring 2016 I was mainly traveling demoing our technology to as many people as I could.\n\nBesides TV networks I\u2019ve met with Google, Amazon, Snapchat, Verizon, Blippar and Facebook. Our goal was to integrate the technology in their existing apps and make their users interact with the world connecting the offline and the online seamlessly.\n\nThe main feedback was something like: \u201camazing technology, great demo! But (there\u2019s always a but) something like this isn\u2019t on our product roadmap\u201d. Except for Facebook\u2026 It was late 2016 and I\u2019ve met with a Business Developer Director.\n\nHere\u2019s how it went:\n\n&gt;*(After I\u2019ve demoed the technology)*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Director*: Wait, can I try it?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Me: Sure, here\u2019s my phone.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*(Director takes the phone and scans the video. The phone showed information about the actor from the exact second Director scanned. Director stays hesitant for a couple of seconds\u2026).*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Director: I need this.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Me: Uhh\u2026 Ok!(My mind was like: Errr, what, how, can I ask\u2026 Wait, what?)*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Director: Here\u2019s the deal. We have a huge problem right now. We launched Facebook Watch recently and are having a lot of copyright infringements on the platform. We need to build something like YouTube\u2019s ContentID.* [*More info here*](https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-29-facebook-is-working-on-copyright-system-to-battle-infringement.html)*.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Me: Ok, we can definitely help.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Director: I\u2019ll put you in contact with the product team responsible for this and they\u2019ll take it from there. We are evaluating acquisitions in this space to speed up our go-to-market.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter exiting the meeting I vividly remember the next five minutes. As I went through the lobby I decided to seat on a couch to recover from the excitement. There I was, all alone, in one of the most incredible buildings in Menlo Park after a meeting in one of the biggest tech companies in the world. I found myself looking at the ceiling and smiling for no apparent reason.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## The M&amp;A process\n\nAfter the Facebook meeting, we discovered we had a potential new market to unveil: copyright infringements detection. Users uploaded copyrighted content with small changes (e.g. by tempering with the audio pitch, by slightly rotating the video and by changing the original video with many different techniques) to bypass Facebook\u2019s algorithms.\n\nBecause our technology was designed from scratch to recognize videos from low-resolution images, we were pretty effective in recognizing tempered videos. We recognized videos that were rotated, mirrored or cropped. Our algorithm didn\u2019t use audio. We even recognized a bunch of different videos inside one. Here\u2019s a demo with a) 10 trailers in the same video and b) a rotating video.\n\nWe arrived in 2017 with our FOX partnership generating mediocre results. No relevant revenue was coming in and the user interaction data wasn\u2019t exciting. We learned that people need a huge reward expectation to take the effort of scanning the TV. Without undisputed usage from viewers, FOX was gradually losing interest in pushing the technology and the opportunity faded during the rest of 2017.\n\nIn February we started talking with the Facebook team. They wanted to test our technology at scale. We thought it was a fair request and agreed to be tested without any compensation. We signed NDA\u2019s and were comfortable enough discussing the internals of how our technology works.\n\nAfter a couple of meetings to discuss the technology, Facebook started to test us with hundreds of hours at a scale we were never able to test before. It was scary as hell! We were all extremely nervous to see if the servers\u2019 architecture wouldn\u2019t crash.\n\nWhen the first results started to come in we were shocked\u2026 95% accuracy and 0.13% false positives. This was incredible for us! This was paired with the [audio industry leader](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10588167.2016.1167426): Shazam. My eyes started to tear up.\n\nWe were tremendously proud and happy about this achievement.\n\nFacebook wasn\u2019t\u2026\n\n&gt;*Thanks for following up with us. It was a great experience working with your team and we think there is a great potential for your company and service.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*We want to provide an update about the evaluation result. From the result, overall we see a good coverage and recall, and your team solved the problems real fast. However, due to low precision and high false positive rate,\u00a0 we decided not to moving forward to the next stage of the evaluation.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Thanks for your time and effort. I am sure our career will get crossed in the future*\n\nCaption: Facebook\u2019s engineer email rejecting us\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDid you feel that punch in the stomach? I surely felt it. It was so unfair to have amazing results on our side and receive this email. When we asked about the differences \u2014 to understand what went wrong on our side \u2014 we got this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*Facebook has our own metrics and process to evaluate the product value of the algorithm. But due to the policy, we are not allowed to share with you. My colleague\u2019s point is the final result. Look forward to getting chance to work with you guys in the future.*\n\nCaption: Facebook\u2019s lead engineer email **really** rejecting us\n\nWe felt kind of used and disrespected to be honest. Remember this was a two months process with several emails and calls between us. It was one of the most difficult moments of my professional life mainly because of the expectations I\u2019ve built.\n\nWe were devastated. I was immature enough and almost took it personally. At the end of the day, it was business as usual for a big company like Facebook \u2014 they ended up [acquiring Source3](https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/24/facebook-source3/) to help them solve the problem. For us, it was a Technical Knock Out.\n\nIf someone from a big company is reading this and it sounds familiar, please take a moment to rethink the way you say no to a startup. Especially if you\u2019ve been interacting daily or weekly for the past months. Invite them for a meeting or call and explain them the general decision process. It will take you half an hour and it will make a huge difference for the startup. Believe me on this\u2026\n\nUnfortunately, after this, we weren\u2019t having solid revenue from our FOX partnership. After discussing with our lead investor we decided to close our doors in an unfortunate ending to what could have been a tremendous success.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\nSo many lessons learned! We could have done so much differently. It was a rollercoaster ride with so much emotional commitment. It\u2019s a challenging exercise but I\u2019ll try to generally sum up the main learnings from the whole journey.\n\nHere\u2019s what I learned:\n\n* The line that defines success and failure is extremely thin.\n* If you are being evaluated (by customers, partners or possible acquirers) define success KPIs beforehand. That way everyone will have the same common ground.\n* Don\u2019t put all your eggs (expectations) into one basket.\n* Stick to what is working, i.e., work on what people want and measure it with data; not words nor promises.\n* Be kind to everyone. If you feel disrespected or hurt, take a step back. Take some time to breathe and don\u2019t reply right away. Time heals everything and gives your perspective.\n* Don\u2019t take life too seriously. Be patient but persistent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite all learnings, the cold reality is that this was a failed startup\u2026 but I\u2019m trying it again. This time I\u2019m doing things differently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Hope you guys had a good read and learned a thing or two :) Let me know if you have any questions.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I'm overwhelmed by your feedback, support and love. Thank you so much! I've been getting a lot of questions about my next step / startup.

                            "comment": "I was suggesting as a consolation sort of...but yes generally there's this kind of evaluation (when it's purely a tech acquisition). Then you have a business unit leader (not bus dev people) deciding can we parter and commercially license this, or is it differentiating enough that we need to own it. And of course could we re-create it /build it without losing too much time to market.\n\nThey might have felt they could do a commercial deal with you because if their problem was solved, they wouldn't care about others using the solution as well, especially since their biggest competitor had already solved it (mostly). That still could have been lucrative, and it could have come with an equity investment and possibly some exclusivity period. \n\nIf they felt it was unique, didn't want it to be used by competitors, and didn't feel like a commercial license would solve the problem, or it was strategic enough that they wanted to control development, only then would it rise to acquisition. They would have then involved a \"corporate development\" person (basically in house M&amp;A titles for large corporates) who would build a business case with the business unit leader, and come back to try out prices / negotiate with you. They'd simultaneously do further testing and probably need about 3-4 in person meetings following the testing. This step, still pre-term sheet, could take anywhere from 1 month to 6-7 months. Once they come to verbal agreement, they'd send it in a term sheet which would have a 30-45 day exclusivity period for diligence. You'd sign term sheets and get inundated with 30-100 facebook people over the period, while working on drafts of definitive agreements which would be about 70-120 pages long. You'd sign and close the deal likely simultaneously at the end of the 30-45 day period if everything went smoothly.\n\nAll processes are very different, but that's a rough idea of how it goes. My comment was just that from what you wrote you were at the very beginnings of that discussion if it evolved into M&amp;A at all. There are a million business unit directors at large corporates walking around saying they should acquire people, but only very few deals end up being done every year.",

Accross BILLIONS of minutes of videos, it still a huge amount where a human will need to review the decision, and if someone else had an algortm with 0.12% false positives, I wounder if that could be millions in savings at this scale.",

Now they are in a position where they are competing against Amazon and Disney with nowhere near enough subscribers to do so.\n\nMy question to you would be: What thing, if it existed, would have made your company successful? \n\nWould knowing that copyright detection was a market earlier have caused you to focus on that?  \nWould focusing on local markets and expanding on that have created the growth you wanted?  \nWould you have taken investor money, knowing it changed your focus?   \n  \nOr something else?",

Thanks for pointing that out.\n\n\\&gt; What thing, if it existed, would have made your company successful?\n\nThat's really difficult to answer but a great exercise. I would say that the main thing we would've changed was to understand what exactly are we solving. We started from a technology; not a concrete problem to solve. After finding the problem we'd corroborate with as many people as possible and build a product around that feedback. If that product was actually getting traction and consistent usage we'd double down on it and eventually raise a Series A to grow and scale the technology.   \n\n\nMake sense? Not sure if I was helpful...",

You have to have common sense when approaching your network: a) explain what you are doing and why (your startup); b) why you need to speak at company X; c) ask politely if there's any change they could intro you to that company. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt takes a lot of trial an error, so start today :)",

After all, it is a straightforward neural network (the gimmick is to have good training data with labels) and facebook is reeeeally good at all of the above.\n\nWhat I bet happened was that they already had that functionality in some other team and after digging around they found out that their internal teams had a better product than you did so you were not worth acquiring. \n\nFacebook already had deep learning in production back in 2014 (pytorch was released to compete with tensorflow in 2016). If you came around 5 years earlier (during the shazam era) BEFORE they got internal people working on it, you'd be a millionaire right now.\n\nhttps://research.fb.com/publications/deepface-closing-the-gap-to-human-level-performance-in-face-verification/\n\nThey could identify faces with 97% accuracy in 2014. It would be trivial for them to identify scenes/frames from a video since faces are much, much harder.\n\nIt's just an internal miscommunication that they dragged you around years after they had better internal tools than what you were offering. After all, they have thousands of people working in hundreds of teams. The AI/ML teams are quite isolated and small and most people have no idea what they're working on.",

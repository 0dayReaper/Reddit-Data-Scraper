Text files, spreadsheets, ToDoist and a bulging notebook are too disjointed. I need something that can scale and help me plan. All signs point to Trello or Monday, but I'd love to hear any recommendations (for or against). Thanks!",

I use excel and form to help me run multiple courses, students, material and management all by myself. I\u2019m a firm believer in making anything automated, automated. Pm if you have questions",

I'm comfortable with my main tools: spreadsheet, word processor, text editor, IDE's, drawing, painting, 3D modeling, and circuit design. I need something to help guide my processes and that I can use to plan with mentors. Mainly kanban-type tools and mind mapping (leaning towards Obsidian vs Notion). I'll dig into the gsuite tools more and give Trello a go :)",

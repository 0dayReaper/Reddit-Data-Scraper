I\u2019ve made a bunch of cool apps to put in my resume and look good.\n\nBut recently I\u2019ve started building something I think that can be very profitable and worth creating!\n\nI\u2019m currently in the development process and I\u2019m creating the app, fully by myself. My cost to create it is basically free except for my server costs, and I guess my time but I enjoy working on it regardless.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I should share my idea here or if that\u2019s safe. But I\u2019d really love advise on how I can make my app into a business kinda thing.\n\nThe app has a sort of subscription program for enterprises, but idk if searching for clients is the right route to take here in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m thinking of maybe trying to get an investor, is this something that\u2019s doable? I have a working prototype of the app but not a finished model. Tbh it\u2019s pretty hard working on a project so large all by myself lol. \n\nIs trying to get an investor at this stage worth it for my app? Should I register a company for the app? Should I just go ahead and find potential clients and customers for the app?\n\nSorry for my bad English, it\u2019s not my first language but I do live in the USA if that changes anything in terms of how I should approach this business venture?\n\nThank you for your time!!! :) :) :)",

No one will just stumble upon the app and download it (this sub alone is full of \"I\u2019ve finished my app and no one downloads it\" posts).\nI would recommend to read The Mom Test and not write a single line of code until you have spoken to the first, or maybe even the first ten users.",

Until they've actually paid you essentially only have unconfirmed assumptions, no matter how good the feedback is.",

I would recommend first validating your idea with the market instead of continuing to spend significant time on development. \n\nThen, once validated, nailing down your launch and go-to-market strategy.

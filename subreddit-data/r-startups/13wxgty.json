I sold an 8-figure company last year that we built after raising mid-6 figures through F&amp;F.\n\nI'm building a replica of that company now but with a celebrity face behind it. The celeb has so many connections that I'm itching to get on the project and do things that I was never able to do.\n\nI'm raising funds for the project because people know my work in the industry, but I'm so ill-prepared.\nI'm a marketing guy. I had no fucking idea what IRR is before I was asked about this.\n\nI also said to this investor that I want to emulate my older company and remain cashflow positive, but just be at 5x pace with this company. (This insistence on being cashflow +ve was the reason we survived when others failed post-pandemic).\n\nHe said: \"Don't ever say that you want to be cashflow positive to other investors! Is this your first time fundraising?\"\n\nFucking hell!!",

Rich kids who got a finance degree from an Ivy League school, went straight into VC and now have raised a fund of other people\u2019s money thinking that makes them qualified to advise people who are doing something they\u2019ve never even attempted.\n\nCash flow positive is a good thing, anyone who tells you otherwise is an idiot.\n\nBut as the other commenter said, you need to center the conversation around how they as investors will make a return on their investment",

            "comment": "Don't ever be daunted by finance questions. They're really straightforward in what they actually mean. The IRR is just the rate of return - how much you get back as a percentage of what you put in. It makes intuitive sense that this is a valuable metric and you'd probably naturally want to know that when making your own decisions when investing as it takes into account the investment amount. There is a specific formula that you can use to calculate it and if you have done that, you've comfortably got a good measure of a company's profitability that investors can understand and use to compare easily with other investments.\n\nI agree that remaining cashflow positive is a good thing for a business - as you've said, not being cashflow positive is one of the major reasons businesses fail. It speaks to a companies stability.\n\nThat said - it's akin to saying you want your company to be able to have the cash to pay its bills. Speak more about the return on their investment, profitability and growth of that profitability. Those are how you're making them money.\n\nPerhaps they don't like it because they might assume or fear you're not separating the importance of cash vs profit, or its overly negative-focused (its about if the company will fail rather than the $ they will see if it doesn't)",

Take what many say with a grain of salt unless you know they have a background of merit.\n\nA majority of individual money out there is merely inheritance, founders who exploited their way through funding rounds, crypto grifts, influencers, etc.",

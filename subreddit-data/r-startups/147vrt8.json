I have 8000 vested RSUs which is peanuts compared to the 100000000+ I know our devs have (I'm non technical). Would I be stupid to leave? I am dealing with a toxic workplace and an unmanageable workload. They are just entering dd now. I do not have another offer but feel I could likely land another role quickly. My husband works and his salary is more than enough to pay our expenses. I am ready to walk but I don't know if I would be missing out on anything considerable financially.",

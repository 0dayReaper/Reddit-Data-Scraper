Is it feasible to approach an investment fund to secure some money to start the startup with just the idea on paper, or do I need to have a ready-made MVP? I work in the industry that  I want to implement it in and I have some validation for it already done, and I know there is a market for it.",

So I would recommend to see how far you can get without the mvp to show traction. E.g letters of intent from various customers. \n\nAdditionally, you might want to explore if you can so a POC or MVP with a no code solution. E.g processes might be manual instead of automatic in the beginning.\n\nI hope that was helpful.",

As for the MVP, I can create it without the backend. In other words, I know that I need a team to develop the backend, and the raised funds would be used to assemble a team and start the development process.  \n\n\nI know it might be more challenging, but I just wanted to understand if it is feasible to approach a funding organization with just a PowerPoint presentation.",

If you write a business plan now, what actually happens (say) 2 years now could be very different. So they need to believe that the team has the capability to recognize needs for changes quickly, and then effectively adapt.\n\nThe validation isn't just around \"will someone buy it\". It's also \"at what price\", \"on what terms (for more expensive products)\", \"how long does the sales cycle take\", and \"through which channel(s)\". And that only gets discovered when actual money changes hands.",

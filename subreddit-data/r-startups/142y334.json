    "postText": "Something that I have noticed about tech advancements and companies associated with it are that many of these companies seem to have been working on new technology as soon as shifts in their respective field occur. For example, OpenSeas was made soon after NFTs were used\u2014much before the average person would hear it on the news. So, my question is how do you keep up with all of these shifts and what outlets do you use to learn about this things?",

Use mature, well established things that have a good ecosystem and community. Beyond that, you are just keeping up with the news/trends. Lots of stuff seems cool but doesn\u2019t stick. \nThoughtworks tech radar can be a useful tool to see what things might be worth checking out. https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/radar",

There\u2019s also a good chance you *do* hear about the shiny new thing, and immediately discard it as fucking dumb- at least until it gets adopted by a significant amount of the community. A lot of early adopters are jumping on early ideas, and not every trend they jump on is good.",

If you integrate AI and blockchain, for example, into your life, you'll understand them much deeper and see how you can enhance various aspects of it.

What the hell do I mean here? Imagine yourself in 1850, when electricity was at its beginning; what you'd do with the electricity? And what you'd do with the Internet in 1985?

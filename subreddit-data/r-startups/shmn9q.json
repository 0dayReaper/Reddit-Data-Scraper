The first phase is to create a platform that allows influencers to put in all their channel links and bio and generate an all-in-one permalink for them to share for their audience.\r  \n\r  \nBefore you meantion, I have tried Linktree and noticed they are more of a management tool for influencers. Also their permalink looks somewhat ugly tbh since they are focusing on analytics, donation,\u2026 My platform is more of a brading, networking for content creators. So the permalink is key feature and has to be conceptualised to be something content creators can promote themself with it. So essentially something to replace: \u201cfollow me on instagram\u201d, \u201cSubscribe my utube channel\u201d in their bio. And with that vision, what I\u2019m struggling with atm is:\r  \n\r  \n\\- Come up with a name for platform. Since the vision is that influnecers can mention it in their contents, bio, so gotta be something catchy, rememerable.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Design the permalink. Obviouly, it has to showcase all the content channels, but that doesn\u2019t seem enough for me.\r  \n\r  \n\\- We are still doing research and would greatly appreciate your help in completing this survey: [Market Research Survey](https://forms.gle/uN5nrPnNyrdeHBiQA)\r  \n\r  \nAlso keen to hear some feedback, advice, or general discussion around the topic.

With only a few lines of code users can implement complex algorithmic investment strategies, test them over years of market data, and set them to trade on some of the world's most popular brokerages. For instance, I could make a strategy to buy Microsoft on Wednesdays and sell on Fridays with only 1 line of code, and test how that strategy would have done over the past five years with a single click. If I like the results, I can connect my own brokerage account and Quandry will trade this strategy for me, automatically. All of this, including the programming, is done through our web platform. We aim to support stocks, crypto, forex, and any other asset classes that we can get data for, while also being able to expand into alternative data sources like news feeds, Tweets, political trends, etc. In the longer term, we plan to offer functionality for users to be able to list their strategies on our marketplace, where other users could invest money into them. This functionality will increase our potential user market tremendously, as non-technical users would still be able to use the platform by investing in their friends or top strategies.\r  \n\r\r  \n**Stage**: Validation (MVP/Beta)\r  \n\r  \n**How Could** r/Startups **help?**: Signing up for our newsletter and joining our subreddit and discord are the best ways to stay in touch and be an early tester.",

Our solution is an app that can digitally store receipts by scanning QR codes at POS systems within stores and restaurants. The app formats the QR code into receipts and stores it locally and on a database. The receipts within the app can be filtered and sorted to easily find one when needed. This app was created with the foundation of helping the environment while also aiding customer convenience.\n\nCurrent Stage: Validation\n\nWhat goals are you trying to reach this month?: We currently have an early prototype and we entered our app into CodeLaunch, a startup incubator, in hopes of gaining some experience and aid. We are working on turning this prototype into an MVP and hope to get some market validation on our idea this month.\n\nHow could r/startups help?: We are currently looking for market response to our app, so we created a small [survey](https://forms.gle/kgKVBohzdA8WCBxe8) that could help us with that. It would be incredibly helpful if you could answer the survey (we added a chance to win $25 as an incentive as well). Thank you so much!",

If I get funded on Kickstarter, I will still consider myself to still be in the early validation stage.  At the end of 2023, beginning of 2024 after beta release, early adopters will be using the full product for the first time.  I expect a lot of issues to arise upon launch, and once the product becomes stable enough for full production release, I should then be at the end of the validation stage and beginning of the efficiency stage.\n\n**Your role?:**  Founder.  I'm running my company as a sole proprietorship.  I should get my business officially registered by March, 2022!\n\n**What goals are you trying to reach this month?:**  Biggest goal is to validate my market and successfully launch my Kickstarter campaign.  My launch date is in mid April, 2022.\n\n**How could** r/startups **help?:**  Two ways!  First is to help spread the word of my Kickstarter campaign.  I am unable to post in the Kickstarter subreddit because I don't have enough karma points.  Second, I am looking for an efficiency engineer who knows how to program unit tests, functional tests, and who loves code optimization.  If I get funded, I need an efficiency engineer to work for me.\n\n**Discount for** r/startup **subscribers?:** If you are a musician and would like the 65% discount and waived monthly fees for life, you can click on the \"Notify me on launch\" button here: [https://bit.ly/3vAd8iX](https://bit.ly/3vAd8iX)",

We are accepting beta users onto our waitlist now, and will launch with this group at the beginning of April.\n\n**Are you looking for anything?**\n\nWe are looking for feedback on our concept, revenue model, and what we can do to enhance the value proposition for consumers. More specifically, we\u2019d like to know which of the following product features are important for launch:\n\n1. $250 bill advance (paid back weekly over 4 weeks, interest free)\n2.  Credit monitoring (alert, score and simulator)\n3.  Identity theft protection insurance\n\n**Discount for** r/startup **subscribers?**\n\nYes!

These fully interactive ads are made possible by our Sponsored Challenges. Ex: Nike Sponsors a 5k running challenge on our platform.

Despite, the development of reusable bottles, 300 million tonnes of plastic was wasted in 2022, which was estimated to have risen by by 20% in 2021. Most of this waste is single-use plastic bottles! This tells us that bulky reusable bottles are not tackling this plastic crisis. My invention is a useful and functional object that makes our world a more pleasant and less polluted place. This water bottle aims to change our consumption of water forever. The bottle is rolled up and stored inside a small capsule\\/case \\(5cmx7cm; similar to AirPods\\) when required the user removes and uses the fully functional bottle fitted with a lid and spout. Having a water bottle available to the user 24\\/7 will remove the need to purchase single-use plastic 'on the go' instead you would use your bottle and capsule.\n\n* Made from plants or hemp or recycled plastic\n* Convenient size to enable carrying at all times (e.g. keychain, pocket or stored in a bag)\n* The outer capsule will look appealing with different colors and designs\n* The bottle unrolled is fully functional, fitted with a lid and spout\n* The case ensures hygiene, especially in the wake of COVID\n* The case ensures protection from the elements\n* The lid and spout sit in the roof of the capsule lid for extra protection\n* The user can carry the capsule and bottle while running, commuting, festivals and other situations and events.\n\nI wanted to ask whether anyone would like to be a part of the new generation of bottles, so we can create a better future for the next generation by removing the need for single0use plastic bottles. Your donations will support the development of the product and sourcing zero-waste materials.",

You need a robot friend to help you with investing: learn from your past and make better future decisions. Robohood is *your* personal investment robot friend. The \"robot\" learns from *your* past mistakes and successes so it isn't just a generic off the shelf \"robo trader\". Say \"hello\" to your newest trading partner!\n\nWhat is our differentiator? The process starts with the robot learning from you instead of providing generic \"one size fits all\" advice. Robohood works in a way that makes sense to you. More than that - we aren't a brokerage, trader - our only interest is to help you become better at trading!\n\n## Other Details\n\nLife cycle: Discovery  \nRole: Founder  \nGoals this month:\n\n* Validate the idea\n* Confirm that people will use and pay for this product\n* Begin to build the AI/ML engine.\n\nHow could r/startups help?

I'm sure that you have something that makes you better, but after reading the first paragraph I couldn't repeat back to you why I should choose you over another dating app. Just be sure to highlight those things.  \n\n&gt; There are 390 million dating app users worldwide but 45% are unhappy with them. Men are frustrated having to swipe through hundreds of profiles to get a match or having to pay to even be seen. While women are overwhelmed by unsuitable matches, and messages with high levels of harassment. Both report very poor results for the amount of time spent on them\n\nThis is great. It validates your market and sets you up perfectly to tell me why you're going to makes tons of money off these people.\n\n&gt; With a focus on quality over quantity, feedback services that help daters get better results, and an experience based on respect and accountability, we're on a mission to make dating better.\n\nThis is super generic, doesn't say anything that other dating apps wont say. You've set yourself up well with the previous section, but need to capitalize. This would be fine if you didn't have competitors, but dating is a hard industry. Just be clear saying \"We offer our users X and Y\", where X and Y are unique features that makes you different.",

It's even harder to measure. Hearing \"I'm fine\" doesn't help either. Whetstone puts into numbers what we can't always put into words. We help teams track, quantify and measure behavior across a population to understand the impact on team-wide goals.\n* Preview video: [https://i.imgur.com/NiyOCc6.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/NiyOCc6.mp4)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n**What life cycle stage is your startup at?**\n\n* Validation.\n* MVP (app + website) are both launched on iOS + Android; launched web portal.\n* We've iterated through a beta app; rebuilt the app from scratch; on version 1.4 of the app and version 2.0 of the software portal.\n* Beta testing on the app was performed in Q1 2020 with the Naval Academy lacrosse program where the entire team was put on a universal protocol. Teammates appreciated (a) getting information back that described themselves, (b) motivation to adhere to team-wide behaviors, (c) recommendations on what decisions to make in the future. Coaches appreciated insights on team-wide performance and the consulting report we offered at the time (we seek to automate this reporting in the future).\n* We've defined our target users and identified competitors -- there are many habit tracking apps available, but many fail to perform much analysis on the data they collect. In contrast, we allow groups to design customizable input/output experiments to identify the behaviors that have positive net effects on their goals.\n* We haven't reached product-market fit. We've only recently launched the product at the end of November and we don't yet have any paying users. We're concentrating on changing this. We're working with a single nutritionist who is attempting to use the platform with her clients -- the clients are part of an interactive course all using the same protocol actions prescribed by the nutritionist.\n* We're seeking market validation. App testers have found value, but there is a gap in the first 3-5 days between the user first downloading the app. The user must check off yes/no for what they're doing before we can tell them anything about themselves! We need to find ways to deliver value immediately to individual users.\n* Beyond that, we need leaders of teams and organizations to validate group-wide user beyond our beta run. We need to scale the product and prioritize getting network leaders (coaches, personal trainers, doctors, therapists, researchers) on the platform as these are our paying customers.\n\n**What goals are you trying to reach this month?**\n\n* Find our first 500 users on Willow.\n* Find our first paying customer on Aspen.\n* Expand our target user base. We're focused on targeting paying clients who will then trigger app downloads: e.g. a head coach pays for the software and his team members download the app.Communicate with app testers and network users accessing the platform to better understand value. \n* We're trying to find people who can give us feedback on the paid portal. We may seek to convert them to paying users later on.\n* Grow social media presence.\n\n**How could** r/startups **help?**\n\n* Connecting with organization leaders who are interested in exploring this platform with their team and working alongside us to refine our value-add. Anyone who does a lot of self-improvement tracking or goal setting will likely get value out of the app Willow Pro on the App Store. \n* Checking it out and offering feedback after 1-3 days of using it would be incredibly helpful. If you like after a few days you'll probably like it long-term.\n* Any word of mouth is of course helpful for those who appreciate the platform.Any feedback on this post and my words.\n\n**Discount for** r/startup **subscribers?**\n\n* Of course. App use is free. For those interested in accessing Aspen, the software portal, reach out for a sign-up code. The analytics are far more impressive online, so even if you're an individual using the app and not someone running a group, I can set you up with an admin account for free to get the full experience. You'll be able to see trends illustrating how you've ranked your goals; charts showing adherence to your protocol actions; a historical heatmap showing scores + notes for each day. (I think being able to select a single action and see the days I did/didn't e.g. dress presentably is pretty cool.) This what a paying user gets.\n\n**Share how our community can get a discount**\n\n* Direct message for free network access. I'll help you with everything along the way and stick around for any guidance needed down the road.\n\n[Willow Pro App Store link](https://l.linklyhq.com/l/i8Gs)\n\n[Aspen network portal](https://l.linklyhq.com/l/i8HD)\n\nThanks all :)",

You need to deal with servers, databases, and scheduling libraries.\n\nWhat's worse even getting and running simple task schedules on platforms can be expensive. Scheduling is priced by number of tasks by instead of number of times it is executed.\n\nOur solution:\n\nWe built an API that you can use to schedule and run any request. The scheduling API is simple and intuitive. You can schedule a webhook to run using a specific timestamp or a cron string. Making it very easy to schedule and manage tasks.\n\nScheduling a request is as simple as making a POST request like this:\n```bash\ncurl -u [YOUR_API_KEY]:[YOUR_API_SECRET] \\\n-X POST https://api.loophook.xyz \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-d {\n   \"request\": {\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"content-type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    \"url\" : \"api.mywebsite.com/send-email\",\n    \"body\" : {\"data\": \"test\"}\n  },\n  \"schedule\": {\n    \"cron\" : \"0 0 1 * *\",\n  # \"runAt\" : \"2022-01-25T16:44:49+0000\"\n  }\n}\n```    \n\nWe currently have a dashboard in works and some client side libraries. Which will only improve the experience further.\n\nThe greatest advantage is since the API is REST based you can schedule almost any request even a GraphQL request.\n\nYour role?  Co-founder\n\nWhat goals are you trying to reach this month?\n\n* Get as much visibility as possible.\n* Finish the dashboard.\n* 100 early customers\n\nHow could r/startups help?\n\n* Try it out.\n* Feedback on documentation and feature requests.\n* Share it.\n\nDiscount for r/startups subscribers?\n\nStarter plan is free. 10% discount for the next 6 months discount on the paid plan for non-enterprise customers.

Secondly, I really like your landing page and it was fun to toy around with the translate your name game. However, I might be tempted to ask -- why should I pay you $24 a year, when I can learn Mandarin (in addition to other languages) on Duolingo for free forever. I just think, the cost is DIRT CHEAP, but, its not enough to get every single damn student who wants to learn Mandarin, onboard. So, for that reason, I think, you either gotta make something that's got more than just the writing feature as a differentiator, or, make it free. Anyways, Congratulation on getting that high rank on ProductHunt and the RedDot award. Wishing you success :)",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\n Potential investor asking for a 5-year projection. I have only 2 months of revenue data and 6 months of traction data such as click rates, and open rates and we just finished developing the app. So, for me, it doesn't make sense to ask for a 5-year projection. How can I even provide accurate projections? It is okay to provide for 2 years but 5 years? I can only provide my dreams of revenue predictions after 2 years if everything goes well and if we couldn't see a new economic breakdown, war, or pandemic. \n\nI know that they want to see the future of the project but it will not be that much accurate.  They want to see the bigger picture created by us, but wouldn't it make more sense to want to see the potential of the product, what audiences it will appeal to in the future, what it will cover, and how it will provide a competitive advantage rather than revenue?\n\nI have already done market research, and where  I am going to spend the investment. I can make predictions according to our burning rates on some promotional methods such as ads, detailed lead generations, etc.\n\nI can provide that \"If I spend that amount of money on that part, the normal conversion rate will be like that and we will reach that revenue\" for only the next 2-3 years. (I even add inflation rates to make it more accurate)\n\nAfter 2-3 years, how can I predict the revenue? In my country, last year the inflation rate was %87 and I burned the money earlier because we needed to raise salaries. God knows what's going to happen next year. \n\nMy honest question would be that is it makes sense and if it is, how should I prepare revenue estimations for the remaining two years?",

For example, does the distribution model evolve during this period to include channel partners to expand reach? Are there strategic BD opportunities to exploit? Other market expansion opportunities with higher price point (or scale)? What else potentially occurs - within your span of control/influence - that can accelerate the growth curve? I\u2019d probably model out a few different scenarios (best vs worst case) and talk about critical underlying biz growth drivers. External economic factors outside of your control can be mentioned\u2026but no need to spend much time there at all.",

Perhaps line item #1 reflects status quo trajectory (based on current biz model). Next year, perhaps #2 reflects a premium version (higher price point) or something that throws off more rev / changes curve positively. Year 3-4, maybe reflect what happens with a distribution partner. These are of course all hypothetical situations. But this is an example of how your model should reflect these things",

Don\u2019t do this in your forecasts\u2026\u201dwe can sell more pea-burgers than all the global pea supply chains can harvest!!!\u201d = class action lawsuit . Granted, the BYND investors that believed the company\u2019s claims didn\u2019t do their own due diligence\u2026it was pretty f\u2019ng obvious that they forecast projected growth that exceeded supply chain and production capabilities, if you didn\u2019t have a pea-brain ;) . \n\n\nhttps://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/securities/beyond-meat-class-action-alleges-company-misrepresented-production-capabilities/",

I.e. if they make 100M in revenue - how much % they spend on sales and marketing and stuff. This should help you to be able to build the projects (as hard as this is).\n\nPre-product market fit, i think it's even hard to tell what happens next week :)",

It\u2019s like Anki/Drops meets a monster-battling, deck-building RPG. While practising your new language, you'll explore a vibrant world fighting monsters, crafting weapons, and collecting new ability cards. Draw these cards in battle and answer language flash cards to play them. Watch this short [gameplay video](https://imgur.com/gnOPBBo) to see it in action.\n\n**More details**: We\u2019re a small team (5) in the discovery stage. Plan is to start early access spring 2021 with our MVP to validate/refine, and then officially launch mid-year. We\u2019re launching with English, French, Spanish, possibly German, and expanding thereafter into other languages. The exact order is not set in stone. I personally handle game design/marketing. Eventually, we want to build a game studio for language learners with a suite of games that address different skill levels and dimensions of learning (e.g. beginner to advanced, vocabulary, grammar, input, output, etc.).\n\n**Looking for**: People to sign up for early access on our [website](https://www.lingolegend.com?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=general) and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LingoLegend) (we post dev updates, game art, etc.).

[Laravel i18n docs](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/localization)\n\n\\- You can use SimpleLocalize CLI to [upload your existing translation keys or translations](https://simplelocalize.io/docs/cli/upload-translations/) (if you have any). Translate the content or run auto-translation job and [download ready to use translation files](https://simplelocalize.io/docs/cli/download-translations/) to your project.\n\n\\- The second way is to use [translation hosting](https://simplelocalize.io/docs/general/translation-hosting/) and fetch JSON directly from SimpleLocalize CDN.\n\n\\- The third way is to integrate [SimpleLocalize API and fetch translations](https://simplelocalize.io/docs/api/read-translations/) as you need.\n\nI really tried to make it easy to use and integrate, so most of my work focuses on that.

[YouTube video of app in action](https://youtu.be/XQ8YIMfSfAY)\n\n**More Details:**  Before the pandemic we cooked dinner 4 nights a week. Last year it became 7. We grew tired of making our staple meals week after week. Many nights we would stare into a fridge full of food feeling like there was nothing to make. Is dinnertime meant to be so stressful?  \n\nWe knew there had to be a better way.\n\nThe problem is every recipe app out there works the same way. You start by looking for recipes with a key ingredient e.g. \u201cchicken breast recipes,\u201d and then scroll until you find one that looks good. But there\u2019s a flaw with this approach. The recipes you\u2019re shown don't account for what\u2019s in your kitchen - so we\u2019re often missing key ingredients, making funky substitutions, or even a trip to the store. It\u2019s no wonder we cook the same meals over and over!\n\nHalf Lemons brings a new approach to the table. You start by taking a digital inventory of your kitchen. It takes 60 seconds. Then you\u2019re rewarded with a rich collection of recipes tailored to the ingredients you have on hand. Every recipe you see in the app is one you know you can make.

            "comment": "Hey friends. Right after graduating from UPenn, COVID hit and I decided it was a perfect time to do something entrepreneurial\u2026.combining my math degree with my interest in the stock market. I took up programming and design and developed Ayrro, an app that automates stock trading in the Cloud. This app allows you to design algorithms (or use premade algorithms) and execute them automatically on the cloud. You'll have the option to paper trade (i.e. trade with fake money) and backtest your algorithms if you are new to stock trading! The app is still in Beta, and I really could use your feedback. My goal with this project is to create an app that people enjoy using, so any type of feedback no matter how small or brutal is appreciated. Check it out, and let me know if this has legs for serious users! Thanks for looking at this. #stockmarket  #daytrading  #ayrro\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStartup Name / URL\n\nAyrro ([https://www.weisscap.com](https://www.weisscap.com))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLocation\n\nRichmond, VA. Available for Beta Testing on iOS / Android\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nElevator Pitch\n\nIn the past, Hedge Funds had enormous leverage over the retail investor because of automated trading systems. But thanks to the rise of the Cloud, retail investors can now set up their own automated trading bot. There is still a large barrier to entry though, and that is knowing how to code. Ayrro endeavors to remove this barrier by letting users create their own trading bot completely without code. If your algorithm performs well enough, you can allow others to use it and get paid for the number of people who follow you. It's a win-win!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout Me\n\nI am the CEO of Weiss Capital LLC (the company that makes Ayrro) and its sole-member. Weiss Capital is currently backed by one investor in a pre-seed funding round (along with any self-financing). If you want to get in touch with me for inquiries or comments please email [support@weisscap.com](mailto:support@weisscap.com)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoals\n\nTo exit Beta testing and go live on the marketplace. We'll achieve this goal once we've received enough feedback with enough beta users using the app. You can help me achieve this goal by downloading the app, playing around with it, and offering feedback. You don't need to know anything about stocks for your feedback to be helpful. Comments on design and user experience are just as useful :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDiscount\n\nAll beta testers have access to Ayrro's subscription tiers free of charge. Go at it, and have some fun!",

A company can be either in form of URL or company description (name and location or name and business description).\n\n* Domain Search - Company in the above-mentioned forms. This task takes up to a minute to execute and will return all publicly available email addresses of that company as well as possible contacts (people whose email addresses can be searched for) in connection to that company. Only verified email addresses are charged from credit.\n\nGreat options for teams requiring such a tool are also integrated right from the beginning. You can have an infinite number of teams with an infinite number of users, and as a team owner, you can control team credits usage and limits as required. It's easy to change workspaces and jump from private to team accounts.\nReferrals are also available to all users from the beginning. There is a forever Free plan (no card required) that gives you 20 lookup searches and 100 verifications per month, while each new signup brings 25 permanent credits to both referrer and referee.\n\nPhase: Live, up &amp; finding emails.\n\nLooking for: Users &amp; Feedback\n\nDiscount for r/startups users - I\u2019ll provide a free coupon that\u2019ll give more search credits to free plan users, just DM me or send support chat message from the app.",

We also saw that Facebook/Insta/Twitter all like to ban people even on accident and offer no real support. Lastly we don't like how Instagram has become super complex with all the features like Reels, and e-commerce, other platforms like Vero are also bad offering a huge list of features and trying to be a combination. We offer a clean and simple interface, the only features we have are designed to give more reach. We are close to our beta technically it's an alpha haha. I'm one of cofounders and the CEO.\n\n**Goals:** The goal for this month is to finish our product and get users you can  help by signing up for our beta. The long time goal is to help people get the recognition they deserve on social media, anyone with great content can get big, you don't have to be a celebrity or super good looking, you just need to provide great content.\n\n**What do you get:** You will get a limited edition early adopter verification badge that increase your account authority as we grow. Your account will also be ads free for life. Join at warbly.co",

Fast searching and powerful API.\n\n**More details:** I've been responsible for optimizing seven-figure devops spend and one area we always ran into problems was logging. The self-host maintenance cost here is relatively high and SaaS providers charge exorbitant rates. Came up with a custom fork of Lucene that was much cheaper to host and have now wrapped it up as a SaaS offering.\n\n**Discount:** First 10GB/mo. of logs are always free.\n\nAny and all feedback appreciated.",

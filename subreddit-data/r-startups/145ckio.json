I hear the same thing: \n\u201cWhen you have an MVP\u201d \n\u201cWe only support companies with at least $250K+ revenue\u201d\n\u201cI would personally be a user or a product like this, but right now it\u2019s too early for me to invest\u201d\n\nI recently learned about crowdfunding and I am reaching out to an employee there to learn more about it.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just at loss at what to do and would appreciate any help",

            "comment": "You remind me of myself 4 years ago. Similar thing. Social app. Wanted investors to get it built. Got quoted as well, scheduled a bunch of calls. I also tried making a whole business plan. Etc. \n\nIt ended going nowhere. It always came down to the MVP\u2026 and I reason with that a lot more now. \n\nThere\u2019s just literally no way to know as an investor that things will work. Even you don\u2019t know that. You wouldn\u2019t sell your house for it \u201ctemporarily\u201d would you? It\u2019s hard to bet on nothing. \n\nWhen I say nothing I mean that there\u2019s nothing \u201creal\u201d but concepts, and idealistic plans. You don\u2019t have real metrics on the performance of your offer. Just belief. \n\nI know your waitlist may feel significant enough but\u2026 it likely doesn\u2019t speak anything real at the end. Just a hint of potential interest. Truly. \n\nSo chances of getting funded\u2026.. really really tough. Especially given its nature. And your experience +/-. \n\nThe odds are totally against you in running itself as well. Financially, experience-wise, core-wise (you don\u2019t actually know people want it until they actually try it as many yesses as you do get), volume-wise (the amount of content/people you need for good ongoing traction)\u2026. So on. \n\nMaking an actually accurate business plan is sort of.. tough as well. A lot of the stuff I wrote back then if I read now just\u2026. isn\u2019t it. The actual problems and needs that have come up are hugely different and far from anything I \u201cplanned\u201d or imagined back then. Results speak as well. It\u2019s like theory vs practice. You just can\u2019t foresee the real experience easily. \n\nManaging a large project isn\u2019t also a walk in the park\u2026 let alone with other people\u2019s money/your house. \n\nAnother point is. Adding or changing features (which will be needed yes or yes), that\u2019s big money on development for some very uncertain stuff with likely not overwhelming traction going on. The maintenance part is massive. Big money beyond just getting the first iteration built. Sadly this part kills a lot. Especially with the uncertainty of it. \n\nI don\u2019t know you though, maybe things are different for you and your skills are different. But. Just some stuff to think of. \n\nWell. This was my experience and the personal lessons I got out. Years down the road I built it myself and it\u2019s the only way I\u2019ve actually gotten somewhere with the entire thing. \n\nSo. Long story short. If you can get it done somehow, do it yourself. Keep costs low, etc etc. Keep it simple. Just test the absolute most core features, see if you get traction with it. I know it\u2019s not the best of what you wish to hear but\u2026 maybe it is best.",

You may know the tech and the solution and the value inside out, but you don't know business.\n\nKnowing business is knowing that companies like yours often start with tremendous hidden advantages through huge amounts of money, family, network and status. I recommend the book 'the unfair advantage' if you want to understand more.\n\nKnowing business is also knowing that you do not sacrifice yourself to the cause with zero interest from customers, or letters of intent, or clients already on board. \n\nForget the MVP and focus on validation. Pay to drive some traffic to a false door sign up for the service. Only when they click the buy now button do they find out it's a wait list. If you can't achieve that, you can't achieve the real thing once built. If you can't afford that, you can't afford the real thing when you need marketing.\n\nDo not build without an adequately sized group of people sat cross legged in front of you with their hands out waiting for the product to launch.",

I had no coding skills, a handful of coder friends/family, but none of them had the time to help build my idea. I decided to start learning on my spare time (which is tough with a full time job in an unrelated field + a family, mortgage, etc).   \n\n\nI've now learned html, css, JavaScript, and have been slowly working on my idea over the last couple of months - after having built a few small basic JavaScript projects. I'm so happy I stumbled on this path because I now plan to make a career switch in the near future and I'm also hoping to eventually make this project live.  \n\n\nSo OP, I 100% encourage you to give coding a try.

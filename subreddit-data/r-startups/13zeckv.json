    "postText": "Just as the title says just an idea over the top of my head . With many using payment apps more than cash nowadays do you think a payment app specific to women which caters there needs  is necessary ?\n \nA app which provides a platform for women financial independence and literacy where in they can feel safe and secure about using and saving there money . Not only providing a platform but also encouraging women entrepreneurship and funding their ideas. \n\nWould love your view on this and plis what you would like to see in it ? (Specially the women lol)\n\n\nEdit: okay after reading all the comments I feel I should say this I HAVE ZERO knowledge about business fintech and finances although i am very intrigued and want to learn more about it . This is just an idea over the top of my head I appreciate all your feedback would love if I got some advice on how and what to do to start it",

Barbie Girl like UX/UI ? Payment apps are not used often in comparison with social app, so the UX/UI doesn't matter except for being easy to use.",

I grew up in eastern Europe so i am not some naive Westerner that grew up in comfort, for this reason i am familiar with such issues and I am telling you, you provide a solution to the wrong problems.\n\nHere a classical problem that i saw, the man is usually the single provider, but he is abusive/alcoholic, so the wife tries to save money in secret. In this case you can create an NGO that helps the women create a secret bank account, where she can save, other people can also contribute to that secret account. I say non-profit NGO because it would be immoral to make money on the back of such vulnerable people.\n\nOr another problem, the man works in a foreign country and send money home, but the women is wasteful and spends all money instead of saving it. Or such in my case I send money home to my mother to replace her teeth, but instead she saved it because she \"didn't want to spend so much money\", people usually care about the health of others than their own.\n\nThe point is, in developed countries every partner has their income and each have their own financial responsibility, so there is no need for such app. In developed countries you have a provider and receiver relationship, the provider wants to control on what the receiver is doing with the money, and the receiver wants to hide what is done with the money. \n\nSo if you want to cater to women, you want go in the direction of an app that hides financial transactions, a secret app on the phone which has a secret bank account.",

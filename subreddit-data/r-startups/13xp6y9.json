There is 12 member team across various functions (no tech or product).\n3. They are doing approx $75k sales monthly.\n4. About to close ~$2 million seed round. They did all the leg work for the fundraise.\n5. Founder is completely non-tech.\n\nI come in with relevant domain and startup experience. Tech and product will be my primary responsibility here (CTO role).\n\nThey are offering founder\u2019s equity and a co-founder title. \n\nI am wondering what would be a good equity percentage for me in this situation. Assuming I take a 50% paycut.\n\nThanks.",

Feel free to ask, if you need a second opinion.",

Here in Europe the tax office would not even allow it without them getting their cut \n\nI think up to 5% would be much more reasonable",

            "comment": "What does \u201cfounder\u2019s equity\u201d mean? There are two ways I interpret this\u20141) the amount (founder level equity) or 2) the actual equity, of equity in the business or options. \n\nI\u2019ll respond to these in reverse order. \n\nFor 2) I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019d give you actual equity. First of all, that\u2019s not how ESOP plans are generally constructed, and second of all, you would get slaughtered on taxes. I have to imagine it\u2019s more likely options. \n\nIn that case, you\u2019ll want to know the strike price, current FMV, and ideally what the exit plan it. Getting the strike price and FMV will give you an idea of the actual current value of the equity plan you\u2019d get. Understanding the exit plan gives an idea of timing over which you can think about earning the value (obviously there\u2019s additional upside if the company continues to increase in value, but that\u2019s unpredictable at this point and so you work with the data you have)\n\nFor the number of shares, the typical equation I suggest for people is to think about the comp  package over a 4 year period, and then consider your alternative, and make the determination of if it\u2019s worth the risk. Let me give an example.\n\nSuppose you\u2019re making $150k right now, and in your current trajectory, you think you\u2019ll get up to $225k over the next four years. Assume the raise is $25k per year. That\u2019d be a great job, but just trying to make the math work. Over 4 years, you\u2019d make $750k. \n\nNow assume the startup, you\u2019ll take a 50% cut. You\u2019re making $75k. You expect over the next four years you\u2019ll make up to $150k. Over the 4 years, you\u2019d take home at least $450k in salary. To break even, the equity offer would need to be worth AT LEAST $300k\u2014and that\u2019s after the strike price and taxes. If you can get the strike price and FMV if the shares, happy to help think through the math on that. \n\nSo then, that\u2019s just assuming you break even. But there\u2019s tremendous risk here. It could go to the moon. It could also go belly up. So then you have to factor in the risk to your equity package, and say \u201cwhat would the value of the equity need to be where if NOTHING changes in the value, it would make it a no brained for me to join. Don\u2019t think in terms of shares, but think in terms of value.\n\nWhatever that number is (accounting for expected salary compensation) is what you should be pushing for. Given my numbers from above, I wouldn\u2019t expect less than 4%. But expecting in double digits after the company is at $1mm annual revenue also is not likely realistic\u2014it would likely be the entire option pool. \n\nBut I\u2019d need more info to give a better informed response. If you can get some more answers, happy to help.",

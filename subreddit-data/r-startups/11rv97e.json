    "postText": "1. Even the illusion of progress is motivating\n\nA month ago, I got a reward card from one of my favorite Vietnamese coffee shops and... you know the drill. Each time you buy a cup of coffee, you get a stamp on your card. When the card is filled, you get a free coffee. You know what? I never used the card. Even though I kept on going to this place for coffee breaks. It\u2019s a well-known fear of new beginnings \u2013 starting from scratch is **extremely** hard.\n\nLet's run a quick experiment. Here are two different scenarios:\n\n**Card A:** You get a card with **10 boxes** for the stamps, and all the boxes are **blank**.\n\n**Card B:** You get a card with **12 boxes** for the stamps, on which **the first two boxes are already stamped**.\n\n**Question:** How long will it take you to get the card filled up?\n\nActually, we don't need to run an experiment. Card B will be filled up faster than with Card A. The reason is called the ''goal-gradient'' effect. Btw, here are the results of \"buy ten coffees, get one free\" card experiment: within the next 9 months, 8 boxes were stamped by 19% of those who were given blank cards, and by 34% (almost twice as many!) who were given cards with two boxes already stamped.\n\n2.  The takeaway is simple \u2013 never force your users to start from scratch\n\nFor example, add a progress bar when you want them to complete a form or profile. The trick is that this bar should contain information that the user has already submitted (name, email, etc). So when they see this progress bar, it is partially full. This way, there is a 2x chance that they will finish the sequence. Here are some more important things to keep in mind about the goal-gradient effect:\n\n* The shorter the distance to the goal is, the more motivated people will be to reach it.\n* People enjoy being part of the reward program. Compared to customers who didn't participate in it, the customers with the reward cards smiled more, chatted longer with caf\u00e9 employees, said \"thank you\" more often, and left a tip more often.\n* In a related experiment, the same researchers showed that people would visit a website more frequently and rate more songs during each visit as they got closer to a reward goal at the site. So this goal-gradient effect is generalizable across many situations.",

            "comment": "A useful piece of behavioural science for businesses; thanks for posting this OP.\n\nA pretty well-regarded paper (930 citations at time of writing) summarised a lot of the research on this: https://home.uchicago.edu/ourminsky/Goal-Gradient_Illusionary_Goal_Progress.pdf\n\nThey summarise their main findings in the conclusion:\n\"Based on a wide range of empirical and modeling approaches, the findings we report in this article provide converging evidence for the impact and importance of goal gradients in the human psychology of rewards. Not only do customers accelerate toward rewards (in terms of timing, quantity, and persistence of effort), but their acceleration also predicts loyalty and future engagement with similar goals. The GDM [the authors' own 'goal-distance model'] unifies these results and predicts the effect of illusionary goal progress. On the basis of this research, we propose that the goal gradient and its modeling have important theoretical and practical implications for achievement motivation and goal behavior and for incentive systems and marketing promotions.\"",

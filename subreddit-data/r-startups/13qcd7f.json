    "postText": "My co-founder and I have just recently launched and are both based in Austin, TX. We applied to YCombinator this most recent batch, and have been gaining some really valuable traction and validation.  \n\nHowever, I\u2019ve seen a lot on Twitter and in the startup / VC community in general about how if you\u2019re really serious, you\u2019ll do it in San Francisco. I know that startups can be successful outside of the Bay Area but, I\u2019m wondering if Austin is becoming the next SF (or proxy) due to all that has gone on there post-covid. We\u2019ve been seeing a lot of startups coming out of Austin. We did consider moving to SF temporarily (and would for YC) however; just wondering what people\u2019s thoughts are on this in this community! TIYA!",

There is still a strong bias amongst investors for Bay Area. The \u201csuspend disbelief\u201d is easier to generate there. If you want to raise huge amounts of money, Bay Area is still king by a long ways.",

Also, it\u2019s a pretty tight-nit hub of other startups and founders that promote each other, knowledge sharing, etc. You can find some of these things in other areas but it\u2019s not quite the same",

He certainly takes a hardline that \u201cyou\u2019ve gotta be in SF.\u201d They do a good job digging into data and understanding parameters of success. I\u2019m sure this is one of those things they looked at closely, and found that the odds favor SF-based startups. However, while this variable may have a high r-squared or whatever, there are certainly others that matter too. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite as binary as some make it out to be",

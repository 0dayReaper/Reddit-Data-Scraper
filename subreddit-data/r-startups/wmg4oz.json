    "postText": "Hopefully I can post this here. \n\nI have one potential investor for my start up whom I know personally. He\u2019s been a colleague of mine for 2 years and somewhat of a mentor. I know the man\u2019s KIDS for gods sake. As stereotypical as this is, he is one of the senior directors of a very large and famous tech company and I worked for him in the past. While I\u2019m not a young woman by any means (I just entered my 30s), he\u2019s 20 years older than me.\n\nHe has promised to invest in my start up before, but always pulls back for some random reason. This is an on going game. He will say that he\u2019s interested BUT My overhead is too high, he doesn\u2019t like my target audience, my business model, etc. Every 3 months he comes back and asks me if I still need money then says he will invest in the future. . \n\nDo I still need investment? And the answer is yes!!!! I recently lost my day job and have been BARELY making the schools ends meet. I am constantly short 1,000 dollars in costs and I am absolutely stressed to near hysteria. However, I broke even last month by some mf miracle and It\u2019s likely i will BARELY break even this month. I have a chance to pull in hundreds of students this september but Im so scared and tired y\u2019all. \n\nAnyway. The guy randomly comes back again promising x amount of dollars if I change my business model and become his partner. And out of literally nowhere invites me to dinner at his hotel. I suspected something was fishy but went anyway. He was quite serious about investing in me but also spent the entire night literally groping me. I got felt up the entire night last night and playfully pulled on his bed. While I laughed and played it off flirtatiously, it was exhausting. This isn\u2019t a METOO thing, cause I didn\u2019t fight him off or anything, in the end he just groped me until I demanded to go home. \n\nBut I\u2019m still somewhat scared of the situation. He has a very large network of people that helped me in the past. He is somewhat well known in the industry especially in tech. I am not joking. One of the jobs I used to perform for him was writing scripts for his meetings with presidents of other countries.  He is that big. His rich friends have kids in my school. I am somewhat scared of completely rejecting him and I DONT want to be a mistress either. But at the same time I thought he was serious about becoming my business partner and no one else is serious about my start up yet. I am quite\u2026\u2026confused about this situation. He\u2019s bringing more of his rich powerful friends to my school today and I am seriously considering not even going to the office today. I don\u2019t want to appear weak and easy to manipulate, but what do I even do?",

Tons of guys like this exist in angel investor land they know how hard it is to get funding so they go around promising to invest in projects to take advantage of desperate startup founders, models, actresses etc. this isn\u2019t nothing new this just sounds like one of Harvey Weinstein s buddies. And also stop being desperate to the point where you are willing to give up pussy for the promise of funding. You will be fucked and dumped like the tons of other women who hve been in your situation. I hate to break it to you but this guy does this all\nThe time. Also if you can\u2019t attract funding by yourself without having to sleep with someone you should really sit down and ask yourself do you have a good startup?\u2026 also do you want to go into business with someone with that low of a moral compass. Also you need to find a consulting firm or something to model out your financials and I\u2019m looking at your post history and sounds like you are running a startup slowly running into the ground. Also you are showing your hand heavy online I\u2019m sure you\u2019re doing the same predators can smell weakness and this guy sounds like he\u2019s noticed you\u2019re running a startup that\u2019s in danger and he\u2019s trying to take advantage. Also don\u2019t accept money from the devil no one will just give u money for free he will holdnyou on a leash forever if you accept that money. Also investors should be people u want to call as much as possible (reasonably) someone who you benefit from but they also benefit if the startup goes well. You shoud not be trying to get investment from someone you don\u2019t even want to be in the same room as.that defeats the point of bringing in investors this early on. I promise you your life will be hell if u take this. One day you say no to him and he will just fuck you by kicking up  some legal issue that could costs 100k in attorney fees but to him that\u2019s peanuts considering his network.",

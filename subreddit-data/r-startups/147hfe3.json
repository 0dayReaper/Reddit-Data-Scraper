    "postText": "Hello r/startups  \nI am currently developing a service that is aimed on preserving commitment of co-founders and creating conditions which allow the team to get rid of bad apples.  \nThe final solution is a backend service for the business that builds trust around sharing IP and equity. We currently work on templates for defining governance, ownership, and content ownership models. We also provide conditional agreements that outline the rewards (equity, payment) and the conditions under which these rewards are given. And we plan to make sure these are executed as agreed on.\n  \nHowever, before I launch this service, I would love to test it as a paper exercise. But I'm a bit unsure about how to approach potential customers.\n\nSo, I wanted to ask a couple of questions:\n\n1. Do any of you have experience offering a product that was not ready as a software, but just a paper exercise? If so, how did you approach this and what was the response?\n2. Based on your experience, do you think that a paper exercise could work in my case? Or would it be better to present it as a full service and only build it out if there's interest?\n\nAny insights or experiences you could share would be greatly appreciated!",

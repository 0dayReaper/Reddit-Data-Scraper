    "postText": "Hi Everyone, I just discovered this sub and had a question related to compensation and equity. \n\nI'm in talks with a startup that is in its very early stages. The founder recently quit their regular 9-5 to devote full efforts to the venture and is able to cover their expenses with the revenue they're generating through sales. There's definitely traction in this field and I have the expertise to support the venture's growth (edtech). The founder is looking for a business partner and from our conversations, there's definitely potential there. I like their vision, can see its trajectory, etc. I'm not jumping two feet in just yet though. \n\nI can't quit my 9-5 and devote full efforts to this, and the founder readily recognizes this because they cannot afford to hire me at my current salary. I'm a solo parent, so I need what I make now and no less. I have a very easy WFH job that would give me space to work on this new venture at the same time, so I'm thinking I could take on some part-time hours (10-20 hrs per week). The long-term plan would be to shift to this venture full time once revenue picks up enough to take me on full time. \n\nWhat are this community's thoughts regarding part-time work + an equity stake? Or should I offer work for equity? In either scenario, what's an appropriate equity request? 1%? 0.5%? Thanks to any of you who can offer input.",

            "comment": "Firstly - make sure this is all communicated. It's to your advantage to make sure it's known that you are committed, loyal and want to be a part of this - even if that's not possible right now.\n\nYou can still be dedicated and be part time. Will you pick up the phone in the evening? Will you pull a sickie to rescue a deal? Will you drive across town to run an errand on a Sunday evening? If you are will to sweat and bleed then you should be asking for \\~10% and forget the salary.\n\nIf your definition of \"part time\" is you'll open Slack twice a week and in between you'll do \\~2 hours of work which you email in, then you'll get a small \"salary\" at best.\n\nSo thrash out the communication with the founder. Put forward options and questions more than your own ideas. \"How much would I have to contribute to own 10%?\" \"If I work 30 hrs a week how much equity is that worth?\" \"Can I work for only equity as I'm in this for the long haul? How much equity can I earn per month and up to what cap?\"\n\nTreat it as an investigative learning exercise. Don't seek a decision. Seek information. Learn. Then say \"Great talk thanks, let me think about everything you've shared and come up with something that works for both of us\" =&gt; Then follow up \\~48 hours later.",

We'll meet again soon to do a deep dive into their product. I'm considering doing a project with them to see if there's a fit. I'm fortunate that I can do this slowly and am truly looking for a skill/vision match because I've been on this rodeo before and want to be careful who I work with.\n\nETA: Thanks for the links!

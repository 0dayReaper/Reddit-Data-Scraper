    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nI an international student at graduate school in the United States, and have been thinking about an idea (fintech) for a long-time, did customer research, etc all of it, so I can start it in my country once I graduate. \n\nThen realized there are already a startup with similar idea that is US-based and focused on US customers. I am thinking about joining them for 1-2 years to understand the business, their pain points, etc, and also add them to my resume, and then move to my country and start the company.\n\nIs it a good plan? Is it ok legally? Is having them on my resume a plus or minus? Is it worth wasting the time?\n\nEdit#1: The US-based company is not expanding internationally per their website, (and especially to my country as the legal licensing for fintech startups is headache for non-citizens)\n\nEdit#2:  The US-based company has 1-2 competitors in the US\n\nEdit#3: The idea is fundamentally similar but I have add-on improvements that would improve the product tremendously. Product might evolve differently as customers might have different preferences.",

There are probably many nuances to the business that you\u2019ll start to understand better by working there.\n\nNon-competes are legal in some US states, so check your contract and state laws. However, employment contracts are typically overly broad. They may declare their market to be worldwide, but unable to prove it in court. Also, if you move countries, it\u2019s even harder for them to pursue a case against a foreign company, or simply not worth the expense. But good to adhere to your contract for peace of mind even if it\u2019s likely unenforceable.\n\nIf you want to raise VC money, having a similar company on your resume would likely be a benefit as long as you had a good amount of responsibility in your role there.\n\nAnother thing that\u2019s likely to happen is that instead of competing directly with an established company, you might realize there\u2019s untapped potential in the market, either in a niche, or in the form of process / product improvements. So my guess is the business you start is unlikely to be a carbon copy of the company you join.",

If you have a shitty equity/bonus/pay structure that gives you no reason to stay then why the surprised pikachu face when it's a revolving door?\n\nLast startup I worked at had no bonuses and a vesting schedule with a cliff. I had 0 reasons to stay there.\n\nCurrent startup I worked at has beefy bonuses promised in writing before equity kicks in. If I'd quit now I'd walk away from a 100k+ bonus. By the time I get my bonus I'd have another 100-200k in bonuses lined up and I'd have equity by then.\n\nIt kind of sucks because finding a job that pays a 100k signing bonus or has a large enough salary to compensate for it is impossible. Which is kind of the point. Large companies in the industry do sometimes offer signing bonuses equal to whatever you're leaving on the table up to a point.",

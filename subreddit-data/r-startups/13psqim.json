Shiny object syndrome - see new things feel like scraping and focusing on something different\n2. Burnout - in the process \\^ face the burnout\n\nI'm not an experienced founder, i'm trying to outsource all finances and legal stuff, but the fact that there's just so much to do with very little guidance, sometimes leads to burnout and low productive days. How do you deal with this? How do you timebox?",

Having them helps a lot cause we can push each other when we need to, and if it sucks for all 3 of us - it feels nice to at least be able to relate to someone who understands and that helps us get out of it.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason VCs are hesitant with solo founders, and it\u2019s because accountability and burnout are real killers.",

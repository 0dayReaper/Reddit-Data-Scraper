            "comment": "Hi there! MBA students looking to work at startups for their summer internships do this all the time. The short of it is...  \n1. Be very targeted in your search - have at least a hypothesis of what stage, sector and function you are looking for. For example, Series A, FinTech startups in a product manager role.  \n2. Do your research - understand each company, who their customer is, play with their product, guess at what challenges they might have. This will allow you to sound well informed when you do your outreach  \n3. Reach out to the likely hiring manager (e.g. if you want to work in product, reach out to the Head of Product) and/or the founder closest to this function. You can find them by doing some LinkedIn research.  \n4. If at all possible, network and get a warm intro rather than do cold outreach - use alumni connections, family, friends, anything to try to get introduced. If all else fails cold email or LI message can work (use rocket reach or some similar service to get email addresses)  \n5. Keep it informational - you're really interested in the industry and think you have a lot to bring given your experience in xyz, would love to have a quick call to learn more about topic 6. AFTER learning more about the company from a contact, follow up with an email pitch proposing an internship and specifically what problem or project you can help them with.  \n7. Timing is key - most startups aren't thinking about summer intern hiring until March - May. Play the long game, build relationships.  \n8. If you're really having trouble (and you might, this job market is tough) consider putting together a project for a few of the companies to stand out and get noticed. I've seen many people do this successfully - for example, doing a project on potential new growth channels, putting it in a deck and posting it on LinkedIn mentioning the company's exec team. Get creative!  \nFeel free to DM me, I'm happy to help you out.",

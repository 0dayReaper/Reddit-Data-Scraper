    "postText": "Sorry for a long text, I just want to give some info so that you could understand my situation:\n\nI am an entrepreneurial electronics engineer who's been providing custom electronics solutions for traditional companies, startups and individuals for the last 4 years. First 2 years freelancing and another 2 years working in a HW startup. Now I am back to freelancing. When I started freelancing 4 years ago  I was working only with occasional queries, cause I still had to attend school (I was 16y/o). For the last 2 years electronics design became my full-time job from which I am making a living. Since I am back to freelancing, taking only occasional queries became not enough and now I need to reach more companies to offer my services. Shortly saying, I am solving problems/optimizing processes for companies by creating custom electronics solutions. \n\nFrom your experience, what would be the best approach for offering such services? For now I could only think of reaching out to companies via linkedin/email. I guess that there might be some more, maybe better ways. Thank you in advance!",

    "postText": "Hello everyone.\n\nI am a founder and CTO of a startup. My co-founders, 2 of them and I are mostly working part-time. since we all have families. We also have a team of 4, 2 devs, 1 UX/UI, and one prospective sales witha software engineering background.\n\nAnyhow, below is my timeline of things. I want to know if I am progressing too slowly as I feel that way!\n\n## January \n\n- Created my first business model.\n- Started initial validations.\n\n## February\n- Co-Founders joined.\n- Started creating business plans.\n- Finished some product technical high-level architecture, etc.\n\n## March\n- Few more members joined.\n- Done with prototype v1.\n- More validation.\n- Even participated in our city's local venture competition, and training.\n- Started coding some basic services (ex. authentication servers, etc) on my downtime or resting time.\n\n## April\n- Achieved initial product details.\n- initiated an agency to create some initial branding logo.\n- currently in Google Cloud for Startup program (will build/building in GCP).\n- Joining some more startup programs.\n- Will join a really big conference show in a city in the country where I reside at.\n- Started connecting with investor networks, etc. \n- More and more validation from interviewing potential customers, other startups, and even investors. \n- Further refined our product. Started working on prototype v2 with our UX\n\n## May - Current. \n- Incorporation in progress.\n- business pitch deck 85% done.\n- More and more business plan materials and research data are already available.\n- Started forging strategic partnerships. \n- Even a data statistics professor is onboard to be a data advisor (once our product has already produced data lakes) and partnered with a good MSP to handle future operations of our product.\n- At this stage, we have revenue models and financial projections, competitive differentiators, further defined distribution channels, etc. (we actually burn some money already like legal, etc.)\n- Btw, my authentication backend is almost finished, and because of that, I am able to create a baseline foundation for code, infrastructures, etc.\n\n## June\nHopefully, LP/website is done.\n- preregistration is available,\n- The conference can gain traction, learn more, and potentially start our fund-raising campaign\n\n## Dec\n- hopefully release a beta with current speed?\n\n## April - 2024\n- Target public release v1\n\n\n\nI just feel like things move soooo slowly, because most startup \"advisors\" always push for MVPs, or fail fast, etc.\n\nI am an engineer at heart, but pretty business-minded, and I also believe in being process-oriented, while implementing agility. I am not impatient, just excited with this whole startup thingy.  An MVP could work with us, but we already have lots (not all) of data that de-risk our idea into minimum viability by customer discovery, competitive analysis, and research.\n\nI want to know if I am doing things wrong, or is it like this. I am worried that we might be too slow in the eyes of potential investor since my goal is atleast to have our project funded since bootstrapping has limitations already.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance",

            "comment": "I think 95% of the timeline depends on the actual dev work required. If the dev work takes X amount of time (required hours) then that's your timeline. All the other business stuff just fits in around that. If you want the dev to go faster then consider utilizing already existing modules/packages and/or hiring some freelancers. And yes, things always seem slow in startups because you don't have a large staff. It sounds like your planning process is solid.",

Depends on the burn rate and tech debt etc.  \n\n\nThe biggest mistake I see most startups making is building without talking to and winning customers. Even if it's shitty wireframes you should be talking to customers.  Instead of paying down tech debt.  It's more expensive and slower to build things twice.  \n\n\nBeyond that, I came from deeptech hardware startups and it was like 3-5 years to build a working prototype I would be estatic to have a public release in a year, on some consumer facing service startups like door dash type things. You can have a beta up in a few weeks.  \n\n\nIt just depends.  Good to have that urgency to go faster, the next tactical question is given all your resources what is the thing that will get you to money quicker?",

            "comment": "Startups progress at their own pace depending on many factors. I don't think there is an 'ideal' general pace for a startup. I find a lot of industries or sectors move at different speeds so often initial customer conversations and research end up timing differently cos some industries are slow to respond.\n\nI think the key is recognising your pace and keeping your discipline. I see a lot of startups frustrated early cos things are not moving fast enough and so push and start building earlier than they should out of the feeling that they should be active. \n\nFrom what you are saying above it sounds reasonably disciplined and any perceived slowness is not down to laziness, which would be the only concern.\n\nI like a small dev team early on as well. I don't necessarily think more devs makes work go faster, I just think it creates a management overhead.  \n\n\nI mostly get people to work to metrics along the lines of 'how did I add value the company this week' and asking 'is what I am doing adding value to the company'  \nthen over time you see more and more value added by each person each week as processes bed in and operations bring structure to the business.   \nThen the pace shifts to 'how did I add value to the business today'.  \n\n\nThe pace grows over time as you build momentum, but it also appears you are on track for that in your plan anyway.  \nKeep the discipline.",

            "comment": "Based on your comments and two recent posts I think you might be doing validation wrong because you are giving into the \"fall fast\" idea from the wrong perspective.   \n\n\nFailing fast has nothing to do with cutting corners, it means not being shy or a perfectionist so that you can put your ideas out there in a way that helps test hypothesis and answer question in such a way that you can iterate quickly.   \n\n\nWhile you have spoken to customers and potential investors my assumption is that most of the information you got is either unused or unusable.   \n\n\nI'm basing this off of:  \n\\- You don't have any customer references and want to use reviews from other businesses as your own to \"prove your idea is valid\"  which is all kinds of wrong  \n\\- You are very vague e.g. \"Started initial validations\" which is only a problem since you use reviews as a form of validation and don't have your own references to back them up   \n\\- You seem to be doing things backwards. You have \"Created my first business model.\" before even having a test such as a landing page to see if customers would be interested in what you are building  \n\n\nI will be biased and recommend you read my post about MVPs and how to use them since I think you would get a lot of value out of it https://lenimentus.substack.com/p/what-are-minimum-viable-products",

That should be feedback from customers and getting a prototype in their hands in order to get better feedback from customers. That\u2019s number 1. Everything else is nice to have, and depending on a lot of things is worth doing in some cases (talking to investors is a good idea, for example\u2026 while accelerators are often a waste of time, but no hard rule )\n\nMy company has 60 people, $4M funding, $10M total revenue and I started 3.5 years ago. We had a prototype (very terrible) in an alpha user (not paid) hands in the first 3 months. It took 4 more months until the 1st dollar of revenue from beta customers, then 5 months after that until we launched paid marketing and did $30k in sales in that launch month. We had $500K in funding come in during that first year. So much depends on your specific circumstances, but if you can get a beta in the hands of users any faster than you are, do that.",

    "postText": "Hi all, I\u2019m looking to start a fintech business and I\u2019m contacting web developers to build the MVP. Anyone know of an established service that would allow me to receive money from a user, hold it and then transfer to another user at another time? Can Stripe do this? Or would I need to have money transferred into a bank account to later be withdrawn? \n\nOr if anyone here is a developer that wants to partner up\u2026\n\nThanks!",

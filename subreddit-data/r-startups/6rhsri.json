    "postText": "**tl;dr** when asked by potential partners or acquiring agents the technical details about how you built your tech, the best answer is \"we employed a significant amount of engineering effort to pull this magic off.\" read further to hear a real life example of why.\n\n\nsometimes the HBO show *Silicon Valley* can be painful to watch because it could easily be a documentary instead of a parody.\n\n\nfor example, there is a scene where the protagonist company gave a detailed presentation of their technology to what they thought was a VC, but instead turned out to be a competing compression company. this scene sparked remembrance of an experience i had as the technical co-founder of a startup in the early oughts.\n\n\ncirca. 2001 we had developed a technology that enhanced a product from Novell Inc. it took us about a year of coding to make it happen, but we completed it and showcased it at Novell's big tech conference called Brainshare.\n\n\nour booth presentation made a notable splash. we had customers dragging Novell folks over to show what we had done because it was what these people wanted and, apparently, Novell had been telling them that it was not possible. at the time we didn't realize the politically volatile situation that this put us in. we just hoped that building something that the \"pros\" say couldn't be done made us look clever and capable. that might have been true with customers, but we got a different reaction from Novell.\n\n\nafter the conference, we got a call from a Novell VP asking if we could meet. we were excited as we assumed the meeting was to discuss either a partnership or buyout.\n\n\nthe meeting consisted of the VP and several other folks in the room. as the meeting progressed, their questions about how we did what we did got more specific and detailed. being a naive idiot, i kept going deeper and deeper into the technical details. (for the technical archeologists who are reading this, part of the solution involved developing our own Component Object Model (COM) server which was the main bulk of the total development time. the joke back in the day was that COM was short for COMplex.)\n\n\nthe meeting ended abruptly without next steps and we thought we'd wait a few days to call them to move forward with our relationship.\n\n\ntwo days later, we got a call from a Novell product manager. he called us to let us know that the VP had decided to develop the tech in-house and was going to give it away to their customers. when we expressed our willingness to talk buyout and/or partnership, he said \"i'm so sorry. i'm only calling you because noone else was going to and i don't feel it's right what we are doing. the VP really hates working with small partners and he's not going to work with you.\"\n\n\napparently, the VP never had plans to partner, he just called for a meeting to figure out how we did it.\n\n\nin retrospect, i came to realize that without meaning to, we were the guys who made \"liars\" and or \"fools\" out of the Novell folks. they were telling customers that what we had done wasn't possible and our product proved them wrong. no one likes the person who makes a liar out of them no matter how many customers it helps.\n\n\nand that was that. Novell told their customers that they were going to build and include the product for free which completely dried up our sales channel. we made one $15,000 sale of the product and then had to shelve it to \"pivot\" to something else (pivot is in quotes because that's not the term we used back then. we just called it \"doing whatever we needed to survive\")\n\n\nas a result of our bad faith experience with Novell, we switched focus from being a Novell partner shop to developing tech on other platforms. (our next big play was to build an anti-spam appliance based on opensource tech)\n\n\nso what's the lesson learned? when talking with potential partners and/or buyouts, the proper answer to \"how did you do this?\" is simply \"we spent a significant amount of engineering effort to make this magic happen.\"\n\n\nepilogue: four years later we received a couple of phone calls from Novell customers asking about the discontinued product. apparently, Novell still hadn't figured out how to build it and their customers were getting tired of waiting.\n\n\nunfortunately, it was a tad too late to save our business and we had to tell the customers that we couldn't help them while i went and found a real job.\n\n\n***^cross ^posted ^from [^dogfood ^connoisseur](http://dogfoodconnoisseur.blogspot.com/2017/07/corporate-espionage-in-silicon-valley.html)***",

(i have faint memory of someone who wrote an implementation for another OS, but the license to it was prohibitively expensive). the COM standards defined both how clients were to be written to access services on a server as well as how servers were to expose functionality for clients to access.\n\nthis description doesn't sound like it should be all that difficult, but that was the rub. it was over engineered and overly complex for opaque reasons. writing clients for COM was pretty straight forward and easy, but writing a COM server was littered with unintuitive, useless, and required code implementation.\n\noh, and it's not client/server in the same way as we think of client/server today as it described interaction and communication for interprocess communication on the same machine. there was an extension to COM for **d**istributed processes (called DCOM) that was more like the concept of client/server that most people think of today.",

Karma served.  \n\nOn the plus side, OP and his folks got out of the Novell marketplace just in time.  Moving on to spam was probably much more lucrative, was a growth market at the time, and helped them diversify their skill set beyond COM and Windows C++; which was no doubt a big help as well.",

A deal of this size involving public companies would typically take several months to complete and cost several million dollars in due diligence.  But because both parities operated with high trust, this deal was made with one two-hour meeting and a handshake.  In less than a month, it was completed.  Buffett wrote in his annual report: \u201cWe did no \u2018due diligence.\u2019  We knew everything would be exactly as Wal-Mart said it would be \u2013 and it was.\u201d  Imagine \u2013 less than one month and no due diligence costs.

You have one voice, one goal on each side, no need for details or bullshit - that attitude is ironically that of a shark, they both come from an enviroment where you get a pat down when you get in a room - no networking, no pagentry and no bullshit. Good luck finding that in the startup culture.\n\n&gt;at least that's thelesson that i learned.\n\nAnd that's why you and sillicon valley entrepreneurs are insufferable. You lack any capacity to learn from mistakes and fail to take responsibility.\n\nI get that you want to be a nice guy.

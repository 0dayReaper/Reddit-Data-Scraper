    "postText": "This whole thing started about 5 years ago and I was inspired to rehash the journey when I happened upon a post I\u2019d made back in Dec. 2012 on the [Fires of Heaven] [p] gaming forums.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\ntl;dr - So, after nearly 5 years of failing at SAAS, within two months we did $147,000 in sales and if nothing changes (even if we don\u2019t add a single customer) we\u2019ll do a little over $350,000 in sales next year. Given, our current sales are more like cash advances, but it\u2019s still cash-in-hand.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlso, we\u2019re currently in talks with another company that wants to test our product with one of their crews, and if they buy in, it would push our sales to over $1,000,000 next year. In my business plan, I\u2019d assumed we\u2019d need at least 50 companies in our system to hit that number in sales, but we could potentially do with 3 and within the first year of actual sales.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**PART 1**\n\nTo give some context, LL is a SAAS product in the timber industry and at this point we\u2019ve spent over 4 years pursuing it. We spent the first 3 years with one guy and pushed out a web app and two android apps, which eventually sputtered, and 1.5 more years going back to the drawing board, raising startup capital, and doing things \u201cthe right way\u201d.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn other posts on Fires of Heaven I\u2019d mentioned that our developer for LL had overcommitted himself and was moving slowly. This trend continued and really never remedied itself. I think this occurred because of two major issues that I\u2019m sure most startups make:  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n1. We hired poorly\n - Our developer already had an app on the market that was bringing him cashflow, so he didn\u2019t need our app to be successful. He was already content and that\u2019s bad.\n - We traded him equity up front in exchange for his time, which created a huge issue six months into development, where he was less-and-less motivated to work. He was already vested and wasn\u2019t getting paid, so it\u2019s understandable. Giving up leverage up front is bad. Don\u2019t reward people for doing nothing, reward them for doing good somethings.\n - He was a back-end-only guy, who tried to wear the designer hat, didn\u2019t ask for help when he needed it, and made way too many executive decisions. He was sort of a loner who didn\u2019t work/communicate well with others. He was a nice guy, but lacked process and the ability to communicate.\n - He didn\u2019t develop on a framework, which bit us on the ass over-and-over again. Spaghetti code is bad.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2. We didn\u2019t spend enough time planning\n - I took our developers word on a lot of stuff and chose to be lazy instead of being diligent and checking up on the software\u2019s progress. This was exacerbated by his lack of willingness to communicate and propensity to get red-faced if he was questioned.\n - We didn\u2019t integrate the design/development process until later in the dev process, which should\u2019ve been done up front. It also tangled up in our hire, where our developer refused any changes and took any suggestions as a direct insult.Which, ultimately left us with an interface of Frankenstein proportions.\n - Scope creep. When you don\u2019t have a design and someone\u2019s building software based on assumptions and what you tell him, you\u2019re going to have scope creep. You\u2019re going to have some much mf\u2019ing scope creep you\u2019ll think it\u2019ll never end. It won\u2019t.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe first mistake lended itself to the second mistake. I still remember the day we met with our developer for the first time, presented our site-map and a simple user-flow, asked if he had any questions, and he responded, \u201cNope. I got it! I\u2019ll get started right away.\u201d I still remember being shocked and confused by the response. \u201cReally? You don\u2019t have a single question? This is pretty extensive software\u2026\u201d I do, however, remember my Dad being impressed and excited by the response, which I think was due to his lack of knowledge around software design/dev more than anything.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis sort of shoot-from-the-hip attitude quickly became the norm and about a year later we were trying and failing to onboard our first customer. I think it was around the Summer of 2014. My Dad and our developer went to meet the customer in person and get him started. Everyone was excited and I was waiting to get a phone call talking about a successful launch. To make a long story short, our developer couldn\u2019t even get him signed up. To this day I cannot comprehend how this even happens, but I\u2019ll point again to #2 on the \u201cmajor issues\u201d docket.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAbout 6 months prior to this we\u2019d totally redesigned the site and hired a front-end guy to come in a put the UI together. Before this, the software was a total clusterf*^$ and nearly impossible to navigate, so it was a necessity. I spent a lot of time with a designer getting everything right and then again with the front end guy to get it translated. Once we got it into the hands of our developer, he totally half-assed the integration. I was pissed.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen I called him on it he was legitimately shocked. I couldn\u2019t believe it. He insisted that he\u2019d done his best, wasn\u2019t a designer, wasn\u2019t a front end guy, and had been left holding the bag to get everything done and out the door while my Dad and I twiddled our thumbs. Mind you he never asked for help or direction during the integration, did it all in one foul swoop, and then cried foul when I got pissed. It was at this moment that I knew we were fucked. I guess what I felt in that moment was the same feeling people get when they realize they\u2019re in a shitty relationship for the first time. And I was most certainly in a shitty relationship.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf I questioned his design choices, he\u2019d get mad and say he wasn\u2019t a designer. When I presented him with designs, he\u2019d half-bake them into the software no-questions-asked and then get mad when I questioned them. The weirdest one was the whole design thing, because he would consistently emphasize the fact that he wasn\u2019t a designer or a front end guy and then lose his mind if I was critical of design choices or front end dev choices he\u2019d unilaterally made. Anyways, I realized that this was a bad cycle that was only going to repeat itself.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter the failed launch, I upped my cries for parting ways with the developer, which had only been subtle asides in conversation up until this point. It probably took 3-4 months for my Dad to get onboard with the idea. You see he\u2019d been the one going to the developers house everyday to motivate him to work, make sure things were getting done and hold him accountable. I\u2019m not shitting you. My Dad went to his house everyday, because if he didn\u2019t, nothing would get done. Work only got done when my Dad was there. So, he went nearly everyday when there were a million other things he could\u2019ve/should\u2019ve been doing.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy Dad didn\u2019t want to split with the developer, because he felt like we\u2019d come so far and actually had something going. FOMO is very real. I mean we had an MVP of sorts and people wanted to use it. It drove him (and me) crazy that it was always so close to being finished, yet so far due to design flaws in the system (like the fact that we couldn\u2019t sign up our first customer). I told my Dad, as many times as it took, and it took several, \u201cLook, I get it. We\u2019ve come a long way and we kind of have a system here, but we tried to launch it with someone and he couldn\u2019t even get them signed up! What\u2019s going to happen the next time? Why would we expect things to go differently in the future? He\u2019s not even developing on a platform and every time we scale the software gets worse.  If we don\u2019t do something different we\u2019re going to hurt our reputation and never recover.\u201d  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy Dad\u2019s fear was valid. The longer you take to release something, the more opportunity you have to lose that opportunity. But, the risk to move forward with our developer was too great. So, we split ways and started looking for funding.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Our last conversation with the developer was pretty brutal. He sent an email to me and my Dad because he hadn\u2019t heard from us in a few weeks and that was unusual. The irony that he was reaching out to us, for the first time, at the end of everything, isn\u2019t lost on me. And my Dad being the honorable and incredibly nice guy he is, thought we should at least talk to him and tell him where we were. It didn\u2019t go well and got pretty heated with me being pissed at the progress of the software and the failed onboarding of our first customer, and him playing the blame game and pointing fingers. Ultimately, he refused to give us the software, the domain, or anything that we\u2019d worked on over the past 3 years.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, on top of the total shitshow that our dev cycle was, our developer was going through a divorce, so I\u2019m sure that added to his woes and created issues that wouldn\u2019t have otherwise existed.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen it was all-said-and-done I think we were out $15k-$20k over a couple of years, which isn\u2019t all that bad considering. And we also had a really good idea of what we needed to build, since we'd iterated like 3 times. We\u2019d built a couple of mobile apps based on user feedback and they were really good prototypes. We\u2019d also attended a couple of big industry meetings in 2013/2014 to get a feel for demand and there was definitely a growing need for what we wanted to build.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**PART 2.1**\n\nIn December 2015 we raised $70,000 from friends and family. We got $50,000 from one of my Dad\u2019s friends in the industry and $20,000 from my uncle.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; I realize that a lot of this stuff, like fundraising for instance, I just kind of blow over like it isn\u2019t a big deal, which I guess it kind of is. So, feel free to ask questions in the comments and I\u2019ll try to get to them. For some background on how we got funded, it's pretty simple. My Dad was talking to his buddy about the app, who\u2019d previously seen the prototype and mentioned we needed money. He made an offer for $50k right there. I recently asked him why he did it and he said, \"Ya know. I've been in this industry for a long time and I know something special when I see it. I'm not getting any younger and my son's gonna need something to work on and I think this could be it.\" Not a standard response, I know. For the other $20k we set up a meeting with my uncle and told him we probably needed another $50k. He ended up giving us the twenty, so we made it work.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHaving learned a few lessons from our previous experience, I went ahead and redesigned the software up front, so that we\u2019d have something to give our new developer when we found him. I spent about 3 months working with a buddy on our previous software to turn it into something better. The biggest challenge was that I didn\u2019t have anything to use as a base, because our previous developer refused to hand over the software, kept the domain, and was obviously super uncooperative. So, we had to use our previous designs and make assumptions about how the minute details worked. I own a small software design/dev company as my main gig and have a lot of relationships with folks in the industry, some who are pretty well known (which was my main context for knowing our original developer was a baddy) and started reaching out to them to see if they knew any Ruby developers that they\u2019d recommend (I liked Ruby because of its ability to scale). I eventually got connected to a guy I\u2019ll refer to as The Unicorn and he was interested in working with us, since he\u2019d just finished a project.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere\u2019s generally three things that come into play when a project works out:\n- **Timing** - Is it the right time for the market? Is it the right time for the people involved? Am I busy with too much other stuff?\n- **Belief** - Does the industry believe in my product? Do I believe in my product? Do the people working on the product believe in the product (generally because the industry believe in it)?\n- **Budget** - Do I have the money to do this? Can I get the money to do this? Is there money out there to do this?  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe committed to work for a couple days a week at $150/hr and figured he\u2019d have our app up and running in about 6 months, which he did and it was. So, by June of 2016, we finally had a functional MVP with an infinitely better UI/UX (I\u2019d made the decision not to hire a front end dev to save money, but since then we\u2019ve released a new version of the site that has a front ender's touch on it, which I will always do in the future). It was a pretty cool feeling to see it working and to have it be a relatively painless process to get it there. I kind of felt like what I\u2019d imagine a victim of domestic violence feels like when they find Prince Charming. Can things really go this easily? Is this real life? WTF? Considering how hard the past couple of years had been, it was a welcome surprise. The Unicorn did a bangup job and there was really only one occasion where scope-creep became an issue and we had to have a come-to-Jesus moment about communicating scope and work.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn July of 2016 we got a booth at an industry trade show for our sale\u2019s maiden voyage. We got a ton of looks and probably left with about 10-15 good leads. I was pumped! And as we were walking out the door at the end of the two-day conference, a congressman came up to my Dad and said that his company might be interested in taking a look at what we had and wanted to setup a meeting. After weeks of post-trade show back-and-forth, we set a meeting for December 2016.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNothing really got done between July 2016 and the meeting date, because at that point we were out of money and none of the leads from the conference had panned out. And with no money in the bank and no customers to get feedback from, we just sat and waited. It sucked.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**PART 2.2**\n\nActually, I take that back, we didn\u2019t work on the software, but other stuff did happen. After seeing the feedback and buzz the software generated at the conference, The Unicorn got interested in getting vested with the company. He\u2019d obviously proven his ability to get shit done, so my Dad wanted to have a conversation with him regarding vestment and what it would take to get him on board. We eventually reached the agreement that he would work at half his hourly rate ($75/hr) and use the other half to generate equity and become vested after 2 years, so 5% equity at a $2,225,000 valuation.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAround this same time that company I mentioned earlier in the prologue, who actually had plans to test our software with 15 of their crews, got acquired for like $9b, which ruined a great opportunity for us. They had a great culture and would\u2019ve launched us into orbit, but it wasn\u2019t meant to be. Womp womp!  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**PART 2.3**\n\nBy the time December finally rolled around I was beside myself with anticipation. One full year had passed since we\u2019d raised money to get this thing going and it was moving at an agonizingly slow pace (we hadn\u2019t raised all that much capital after all, so we couldn\u2019t just throw money at it). Money really does speed up the process.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWithout getting too deep into the weeds the meeting went really well. The company we met with is probably the most reputable in my state and is to our industry what Jordan\u2019s are to sneakerheads. They loved what we had and it was a super encouraging meeting. They wanted us to come back again in February and present our software to their whole organization. They\u2019re owned by some of their employees and wanted to get the nod from everyone involved.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, again nothing happens for another two months and we revisit the situation in February. This time the meeting went even better and their employees were even more pumped about the software than we\u2019d thought they would be. We had a post-meeting-meeting with the owner to talk shop and the details. I told him it\u2019d take us about six months and $107,000 to customize the software for their company, which didn\u2019t seem to phase him. So, I wrote up a contract on the spot, which we both signed, shook hands, and walked out the door with a $17,000 check; payment 1 of 6. I had The Unicorn snap a pic of the two of us shaking hands. I\u2019ll probably frame it and bottle the tears I\u2019m going to shed every time I look at it.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI actually could\u2019ve walked out of there with nothing. After we shook on the deal he said, \u201cAlright, well I guess we\u2019ll just mail you the check.\u201d And I asked, \u201cCould we just get a check right now?\u201d He smiled, shrugged, and then nodded in agreement and told his accounting to go print out a check. Leaving with that check made it feel 10x more real for me and The Unicorn. Asking that simple question taught me a huge lesson--You don\u2019t get what you don\u2019t ask for!  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; As a side note, after The Unicorn came on board we attended most meetings together. This was less of a proactive decision and more the result of me making myself more involved in the design/dev stuff, because I was not going to repeat the past. My Dad spent more time getting us the leads to make the sales, and less time in the day-to-day, since he\u2019s got 25 years in the biz. He\u2019s our \u201cgray hair\u201d and if you\u2019re young you need a gray hair. Otherwise, people don\u2019t trust you as much or something?  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith renewed hope and excitement we immediately roared back into gear and got an iOS app designed (for data entry in the field) and developed, and started working on the MVP again.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHowever, more bumps in the road presented themselves. After such positive meetings in December and February it kind of threw me off when the owner of the company completely stopped being responsive. We didn\u2019t receive our next check in March and it took me being super pushy to get a second check by April. In May, after another no-show check, we pretty much stopped working again, because we weren\u2019t sure where we stood or if we still had a deal. I even asked another business owner for advice on how to approach the matter.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo make a long and drawn out story short. The owner of the company had been super preoccupied with other businesses he owns and had told the other employee-owners to take the reigns, but they didn\u2019t, which left him on the hook and out of touch. It was an incredibly stressful time for me, since I wasn\u2019t sure if his lack of response indicated some deeper discontent on his part. Ultimately, he was still excited about the software and in June of this year we secured the rest of the money, a $67,000 check, and plan to launch with 30 of their crews in January 2018.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBy this time a year had passed since our last state tradeshow and it was time to attend again. This time, with a real customer in our books, I had way more confidence and the conference felt a lot more fun than it had the year before.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Another side note concerning sales. During the 2016 tradeshow I was super stressed out and hated it. I think it was partly due to the pressure of having unproven software and partly due to the fact that I don\u2019t really like the idea of convincing people to buy something they know nothing about and might not even want. However, when you get your first customer, selling starts to feel a lot less like \u201cselling\u201d and a lot more like you\u2019re providing people with something they **need**. It really comes down to your belief in what you\u2019re doing. You should never try to convince a customer to buy if they don\u2019t want to, because if you\u2019re a genuine believer in your product, others will become believers too.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter the first day of the conference, I ended up at the bar of our hotel with a couple other vendors who I\u2019d befriended from previous events (one of the clients from my other company is in this industry, so I\u2019d run into people here-and-there). The bar closed around 10:30PM and we were pretty much the last people in there and decided to call it a night to get ready for another early morning.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe only other people in there were two dudes sitting at the bar and as soon as we got up to leave one of the bar-guys yelled, \u201cYou guys want a water moccasin shot?\u201d We replied, \u201cNo, it\u2019s getting late and I think we\u2019re gonna go to bed.\u201d Bar guys yells, \u201cWhat are yall? A bunch of pussies\u201d? We all look at each other half-laughing, and shrug, and walk over to the bar.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe take the water moccasin shots and then some other kind of fruity pink shots. Apparently this dude has been tipping well, because the bartender was happy to keep the bar open. Somehow, because things started to blur, it comes up that I have some software for tracking stuff in the industry, so he starts describing an app he wants. And I\u2019m shocked. No, I\u2019m floored. He\u2019s literally describing one of the first smartphone apps we built that got rejected by the industry, because it was too future forward (basically everyone we showed it to said it wouldn\u2019t work because reasons). I laughed and said, \u201cDude! I built that two years ago and no one wanted it, so we had to build something different.\u201d He slapped his knee and said, \u201cWell I want it! How much can I get it for?\u201d I pitched him my starting price and he immediately countered at half, which is what I actually wanted, and responded, \u201cDeal!\u201d We shook hands and he proceeded to tell us the most ridiculous and hilarious stories I\u2019ve ever heard in my life. It was actually a really fun night.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI walked back into the hotel room around 1AM and woke my Dad up carrying on about the deal we\u2019d just struck up. He had been asleep, but woke up laughing because I was being ridiculous, due to the excitement (shots). He was happy to be woken up too, considering the context, and excited about another potential customer.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe sales cycle on this deal was exponentially shorter than the first and we launched with them on September 15th, two months after we first met. They fronted us $40,000 to get additional iOS functionality developed, and will use/pay for our standard system until March/April 2018 when I think we can get the app done.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, after nearly 5 years of failing at this, within two months we did $147,000 in sales and if nothing changes (even if we don\u2019t add a single customer) we\u2019ll do a little over $350,000 in sales next year. Given, these sales are more like cash advances, but it\u2019s still cash-in-hand.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlso, we\u2019re currently in talks with another company that wants to test it with one of their crews, and if they buy in, it would push our sales to over $1,000,000 next year. In my business plan, I\u2019d assumed we\u2019d need at least 50 companies in our system to hit that number in sales, but we could potentially do with 3 and within the first year of actual sales.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n------------------------  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Follow up**  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs people have asked questions, it's made me realize that I failed to cover some important parts to my story, but none as much as this question:  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; [haxpor](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/710r53/after_5_years_of_fail_i_made_147000_in_two_months/dn8wmky/) One question, do you recommend having run business with your family? What has gone not so well or what's the things we should look for to have it working out? I mean most advice out there doesnt suggest to have run business with family persons.\nThanks  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is probably the best question I've been asked. I think it really depends on what your relationships are like with family members.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo me there's no difference between business and life. Whenever I hear someone say, \"Hey, it's just business!\", I roll my eyes and recognize that's someone I wouldn't want to do business with. Business isn't just business. Often times, it's the blood, sweat and tears of someone's dream. So, to undermine something that people value so much by calling it \"just business\" is incredibly ignorant. More often than not, it's just a shield covering up a lack of integrity.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHaving said that, if you see eye-to-eye with someone and trust them, then you could probably do business with them.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI think a lot of people make the mistake of getting into business with people they don't know very well because they have same idea. Unfortunately, having the same idea doesn't mean you're of one accord.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFortunately for me, my dad is the best man I know. My uncle is one of the best men I know. My other investor is one of the humblest men I know. The Unicorn is diligent, dedicated and incredibly humble. My designer is one of my best friends. My front end developer has the utmost integrity and honesty.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUltimately, the people I've surrounded myself with are better than me.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[p]: https://www.firesofheaven.org/threads/adventures-with-lyrical-buying-a-business-repost.1240/page-47#post-2186321",

Especially when waiting on for the next meeting several months out. Was this primarily caused by lack of funds or partially that you were discouraged by he business? Looking back - what do you wish you had done differently during those rest periods?\n",

It was basically Zillow for the individual real estate agent, because the home shopping experience on their sites suck (and still do!).  \n\nWe launched at the bottom of the market when most of our potential customers were getting OUT of the market, we had an incredibly competitive space, and two of our founders were leaving for grad school. The three things (timing, belief, budget) that I mentioned need to come together for a project to succeed didn't happen, so it ultimately failed.  \n\nI used those lessons to pursue a different product in a different industry the second time around.\n1. this time the timing was way better and the market is up, so people are looking for ways to grow efficiency/security.\n2. the space lacks competition--our two major competitors are basically glorified excel spreadsheets and the major player in the space costs millions to implement.\n3. I have an amazing team, mostly due to my other work, but also because I found the right people at the right time.\n\nSo, I think while perseverance has played a huge role a lot of conditions that have made it possible for some success (I don't think we've come close to making it yet) are there.  \n\nAll of the downtime had everything to do with lack of funds and the fact that you still have to make a living in the meantime. My dad would do his forestry stuff (and still does) and I would do my agency stuff (I do it a lot less now).  \n\nI've never had a single moment where I doubted the validity of our product. Never once. And anytime people have said it wouldn't work or was a bad idea, while it definitely discouraged me, it also fueled my drive to make it work.\n\nI don't think I could've done anything differently during the rest periods, other than find a different early adopter, which are pretty much like unicorns in this industry.\n\nEverything in my journey has happened exactly like it was supposed to and in the perfect timing.

Often times, it's the blood, sweat and tears of someone's dream. So, to undermine something that people value so much by calling it \"just business\" is incredibly ignorant. More often than not, it's just a shield covering up a lack of integrity.\n\nHaving said that, if you see eye-to-eye with someone and trust them, then you could probably do business with them.\n\nI think a lot of people make the mistake of getting into business with people they don't know very well because they have same idea. Unfortunately, having the same idea doesn't mean you're of one accord.\n\nFortunately for me, my dad is the best man I know. My uncle is one of the best men I know. My other investor is one of the humblest men I know. The Unicorn is diligent, dedicated and incredibly humble. My designer is one of my best friends. My front end developer has the utmost integrity and honesty.\n\nUltimately, the people I've surrounded myself with are better than me.",

Think from his/her perspective - you were working full time on another job, so why should they put the majority of their time into your project? Plus it's clear you were either paying him very little or nothing, probably with compensation in very-likely worthless equity. Good developers are expensive, and if you can't afford it and try to cut costs (outsourcing) you can expect a worse product.",

If it belongs to someone who's no longer motivated, it's a curse because you've already given away the highest value proposition. All your cards are spent at that point. Which is the situation we were in.\n\nI made mistakes. If you read through the entire post, I'm very candid about them. My own mistakes didn't cause personal frustration, because they were mostly tied to postmortem lessons: not being diligent, lack of communication, and starting the dev cycle without solid designs. \n\nThe story highlights what actually happened and how I felt in the moment and the lessons I learned after the fact.\n\nBad relationships are bad however you spin it, but you're free to have your own perspective.

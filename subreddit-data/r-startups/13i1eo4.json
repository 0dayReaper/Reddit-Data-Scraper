    "postText": "tl;dr funding round failed due to insecure market conditions.  \n\n\nHey everyone!\n\nWe've been running a fintech since end of 2020 and scaled up to 15k - 20k MRR. The niche we're in pretty much crashed by the beginning of this year and so did our revenue. Investors we have talked to are currently completely leaving the industry behind which makes it close to impossible to receive funding from them.\n\nOur competitors pretty much have the same issues so a competitor buy-out would not be an option.\n\nI'm currently running out of ideas and closing down business is the only option left in my opinion.\n\nI would appreciate every single idea you guys have.",

            "comment": "Financially speaking, you have 4 options. \n\n1) Cut burn - Extend runway 2-3 years which means you can only afford to carry 1-3 people. If you have 20 people currently at the company, this is going to hurt a lot. Also look to cut every single non-core SaaS and re-negotiate with any infrastructure providers that fall into your cost of revenues/goods sold. \n\n2) Increase revenues - If the niche has failed, there may be other niches to pivot into. You can also take stock of the company\u2019s assets and find new ways to combine them for a fresh approach to the market. \n\n3) Find alternative funding - Find other investors, see if there\u2019s debt funding available, sell your receivables, do an equity raise from your current customers. \n\n4) Exit - If the niche is competitive, there may be a PE or strategic buyer opportunity to inorganically scale revenue through acquisition. If your team is talented, there could be someone willing to do an acquihire. The last option is to shut down completely.\n\nGood luck and deep breaths.",

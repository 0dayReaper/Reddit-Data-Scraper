We all have weight scales yet we dont use them as often as we should and so, we tend to lose grasp of our weight...we believe (and [research ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/daily-weighing) proves) that the more you weight yourself the more likely it is for you to stay in shape. That's why we made CozyScale, a patented bathmat set that fits on almost any weight scale. Make of your bathmat a weight scale and dont lose track of your weight!\n\n-) More details: as you can see we will run a kickstarter campaign soon.

                    "comment": "Just to say, the research link you provide is questionable. Their interpretation of some of those studies comes across pretty biased - most of the studies are based on people trying to lose weight, for example, than simply maintain or stay in shape. A couple refer to more than weighing as well, without any evidence that the weighing was truly the main factor involved. \n\nI'd recommend creating your own post - for one, I don't know many people who would read Healthline and consider it trustworthy - and referring to sources that address what you're trying to solve in a positive way, leaving out ones that are irrelevant. While it won't bother everyone, personally if I see reference to studies that are vaguely related but don't actually tell the story the business is suggesting it looks like the business is being intentionally misleading, or hoping the majority of customers will see sources and assume all is fine without reading them - which makes me think poorly of the business.  \n\n\nAdditionally, how is the integration with a bath mat functional? My bath mat can get pretty soaked, I hate the idea of that sitting on anything electronic. Then, because scales are usually reactive to any noticeable weight, my other concern is knocking it or standing on that section by accident as that means increased battery useage. It's hard to tell anything on the current Kickstarter page, sorry. I also wonder about useable area of the bath mat - is it larger than the average mat, or do you effectively lose some of the mat area? What is the contact with the floor like on the mat and scale areas, and how raised is the scale area? Are you doing anything to address the fact that for some individuals accidentally getting a weight reading while wet may have a negative effect, even a disclaimer?  \n\n\nPlease don't take it as me being negative! These are just questions I had, because the idea interests me, but without the live product page I can't get the answers. And if I add it to my saves or reminders I'll totally overlook it. Regading the research link, that's totally intended as help. You may already be working on your own version, but I thought I'd mention it. I also think linking to a site that basically churns out 'content' can look like the research is an afterthought, as a way of selling the product. Which, even if true, isn't the impression you want to give. Wishing you all the best with it. I'm very interested in the answers to what I asked above, as less faffing is always a plus for me.",

All existing solutions are only able to connect to the business version of the apps, which sales people do not use.\n- The lack of integration makes managing these communications difficult.

Our platform can integrate with these personal apps to automatically log the messages in the CRM, analyze them for sentiment, and suggest responses based on topic.\n* Analytics &amp; Forecasting - The data allows us to provide insights on who's engaged, what items are at risk, what the close date would be, etc.\n\n**What life cycle stage is your startup at?** Building MVP\n\n**Your role?** Co-founder\n\n**What goals are you trying to reach this month?**\n\n* Finish and launch MVP\n* Get 5 LOIs\n\n**How could** r/startups **help?** Anyone is a B2B sales person or know any B2B sales people who might find this interesting?

The advantages and benefits of using DynConD are increased application performance, reduced latency, higher business productivity and optimized use of WAN bandwidth and server resources.\n\n\r  \n**More Details:** DynConD is used by replicated and distributed network services for better user experience and global server load balancing. The client selects the optimal server independently, based on a measured network distance between client and servers (in contrast to commonly used imprecise geographic proximity) and the current server load or service response time. DynConD introduces a composite DNS metric that allows the client himself, rather than a remote server, to make the final decision as to which server, represented by IP address in a DNS response, is best for him. The server parameters are supplied to the client via the standard DNS infrastructure and provide the client with information about the current status of the server load and/or the service response time of a particular network service.\n\n\r  \n**What life cycle stage is your startup at?** Stage 2 Validation\r  \nWe have finished developing our iOS and Android applications and libraries and are now ready to enter the market. \n\n\r  \n**What goals are you trying to reach this month?** Improve our market and brand presence, start developing a Windows version of the service and expand our customer base.\n\n\r  \n**Discount?** All users receive a 30-day trial version of the service",

We have also modelled such benefits as decreasing parking related carbon emissions, increasing public transportation use and facilities, and providing significant demand to the global parking shortage. \n\nWe have focused on developing this product to be completely customised, automated, green and affordable/cost efficient. Our projections have illustrated in many cases that the saved land space and increased vehicle capacity can cover all Auto-park system costs.\n\n In many cases, we find that our system frees upwards of 40% of previously occupied land space, broadening the capacity to further develop or increase on your properties capital potential.\n\n At this stage, we are on the hunt to develop a team filled with people who not only believe in our product as much as we do, but who share the same vision on changing traditional parking environments for the better.\n\nWe would absolutely love to hear your feedback and suggestions from the Startup community!! \n\n  \nIf you would like to reach out, feel free to fire me a direct message!  \nPlease find us on www.globalparkingsolutions.co.nzjoshua@globalparkingsolutions.co.nz",

            "comment": "**Name:** VGC Software\n\n**URL:** [https://www.vgc.io](https://www.vgc.io)\n\n**Location:** Montpellier, France\n\n**Elevator Pitch:**\n\nVGC is an upcoming suite of applications for graphic design and 2D animation, in which the shapes you draw can have shared boundaries and be intuitively sculpted. It solves many problems people have with Adobe Illustrator and After Effects.\n\nNote that we're currently running a Kickstarter campaign for our first product VGC Illustration to be released on July 2022. Our second product VGC animation should be released a year later.\n\n**Explainer videos:**\n\n* VGC Illustration: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vgcsoftware/vgc-illustration-the-drawing-app-of-the-future](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vgcsoftware/vgc-illustration-the-drawing-app-of-the-future)\n* VGC Animation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwYgUhQBAkE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwYgUhQBAkE)\n\n**Stage:** Discovery. We already have a research prototype for Windows/Mac/Linux that you can download for free here: [https://www.vpaint.org/](https://www.vpaint.org/) . But a viable version 1.0 is still being developed.\n\n**Looking for:** Users and feedback.\n\n**More Details:**\n\nThis comes from my PhD research at the University of British Columbia. The idea is that in most vector graphics editors (Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, etc.), the vector paths you create are all independent to one another. This makes it annoying to represent shapes that have shared boundaries, and particularly painful to edit these shared boundaries. If you're creating SVG animations for the web, you may be familiar with this problem too.\n\nTo solve this, we developed a new topological data structure, somewhat similar to what is used in 3D modeling / CAD, but designed specifically for the needs of 2D vector art and 2D animation. It sounds complicated, but in reality it makes creating some illustrations and animations much more intuitive! Our initial users love it. The research papers have been published and presented at SIGGRAPH, and I was honored to receive the Alain Fournier Award for best Canadian computer graphics dissertation for this work.\n\nNote that's I'm trying a not-so-common business model, where the code is actually open source ([https://github.com/vgc/vgc](https://github.com/vgc/vgc)), but I'm still selling commercial licenses and monthly/yearly subscriptions to make the business sustainable. So anyone who knows how to compile can legally compile it and use it for free. But the binaries downloadable from the website will have a 30-day trial period then ask for a license key / subscription.",

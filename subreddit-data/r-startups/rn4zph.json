    "postText": "I've attempted over 6 software startup ideas on my own. 5 failed, one worked and I sold it to private equity 2 years ago. The companies that failed were when I decided to go full-time on something that wasn't even validated yet. The stress of having runway on something that may or may not work impacted all of my decision skills and just drove the business to the ground. The truth is, it takes time to establish a sales pipeline, market yourself to your ideal customers, and actually flesh out a useable product.\n\nAfter burning through all of my savings stressing out about making a living and doing too many failed launches, I took a job doing software contracting. I still wanted to do a business full-time, but I thought I'd do it differently. I picked a slower growing SaaS category and chipped on it during the night and the weekends. After about 8 months I was generating $2k in recurring revenue, but I still didn't quit. It was only once I hit $15K MRR and could afford to hire my first employee that I stopped being a contractor after 2 years.\n\nWhen I was \"full-time\" on doing startups, I had the mindset and stress of having to generate revenue now. I didn't even last four months on one venture realizing it would take longer for me to even get meaningful margins. The only time I've seen going \"full-time\" on an idea work is if you can raise $2MM venture rounds pre-traction, and even then those teams took 2-3 years to hit product market fit and have meaningful revenue.\n\nDon't quit your job until your business can give you a job.",

I turn off my work computer, come home, and turn on my personal computer to work on the startup. \n\nI was also upset about how slowly my startup was progressing due to work obligations. For example, I couldn't speak or meet up with clients for my startup because I was busy at work. When I was free, the workday was over and people were not available. \n\nAlso, no investor, advisor, mentor or even potential co-founders would take my startup seriously because it looked like I was not fully committed. Their thought was that the idea must not be that great if even the founder doesn't want to fully commit. \n\nMeanwhile, my job started suffering because I was overworked, overwhelmed, and not focused. \n\nWhen I finally left, I felt a weight lifted off my shoulders, and I was finally waking up every morning to work on my startup, which I loved doing. I was also able to freely advertise it on social media without worrying about my job finding out. \n\nOf course, I was lucky that I had a partner to financially support me and a good amount of savings. I also knew that if push came to shove, I would have a lucrative job to fall back on. So it is all about the context.\n\nIf you have other responsibilities such as debt, children, and other dependants, then it's a different situation.",

Having a plan B may sound rational but it weakens your determination, which is exactly what it takes to build a successful startup.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ll be turning 18 July this summer, and want to really start ramping it up in terms of making money for myself, I have a little bit of money saved from things and recently been selling my own unused items which is making me a good bit. \nI have done a good bit of research into online businesses from dropshipping to service arbitrage to digital marketing agencies, with school it\u2019s hard for me to get the time to manage one of these if I were to set it up. But this summer I would like to get the ball rolling slightly and be creating an income for myself before finishing school next year.\n\nBesides this, I will be looking for a full time job this summer, and also have a meeting soon with a rental owner who wants me to do some odd jobs and maintenance in her tenants house as long term work. She will pay per day worked on this.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your guys thoughts and advice for someone in my position.",

Just apply all your time and focus on work.  \nBut be very specific with your goal, if you want to run your own startup next year, find a company in a similar niche",

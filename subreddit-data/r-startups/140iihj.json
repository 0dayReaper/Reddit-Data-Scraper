If I let him know i am working on a startup i'm sure i'll get fired. \n\nI have $20k raised from friends and family and wanted to start pitching to pre seed startups specifically and was wondering if having the business registered and trademarked will be a bare minimum or it doesn't matter that much.",

Talk to a lawyer to make sure you don\u2019t have any issues with IP. \n\nMy recommendation would be to avoid doing ANYTHING related to the new business on your work equipment. No emails, no phone calls, and definitely no files. Don\u2019t say a fucking thing to anyone you work with. Don\u2019t give them an opening to have a claim on any of your data.\n\nOh, and make sure you\u2019re setting up the right sort of entity. VCs will typically only invest in Delaware C Corps. There are exceptions, but it\u2019s rare.",

If you want a vc to put in $200k or more be upfront that the company isn't established and make that one of the first things for the funding oncd you're up and running.. it's not a big deal, but just be sure to mention it.",

I want to mention my situation with them and let them know that it will be the first thing I do once i actually get funding and wanted to know if it would be an automatic rejection or if it\u2019s something that happens regularly",

But you\u2019ll need it to accept an investment. \n\nYou do not need a trademark which you could get without a company, and more likely after the company is formed. \n\nIt will be obvious to investors after the fact when the business was formed. Most angels aren\u2019t going to do any records diligence at this stage.",

    "postText": "Background - Two young entrepreneurs developing a product in food tech, early stage, full-time working on this for about \\~8 months now. Strong product team, lack of connection in the space. Raised some angel money, going on a pre-seed round over the summer. We\u2019ve been working with an advisor who\u2019s been successful in that space and her name is well-known in the industry. She wants to be more involved in the project and become a partner with 10% equity. Both current cofounders are 50/50.   \nWe\u2019ve been thinking of offering her a co-founder position. She works on her own time as she travels a lot, but we speak most days. She can potentially make a real difference to the company, especially at such an early stage. Lots of possible upside, But I want to know what we should be careful of. Could her not being a real full-time co-founder be a problem? How can we create an accountability structure with her role which is really about opening her network to distribution partners and investors? Anything else to think about? Thanks!",

But there needs to be more action if you're gonna bring her on as a cofounder",

Are you going to be bitter that she has 10% but wasn\u2019t in the trenches with you?\n\nYou need to think through all the scenarios\u2014from wild success to utter disappointment, and work out the details of the \u201cif this, then that\u201d in the relationship. \n\nNot having a full time co-founder can generate tremendous resentment both when things don\u2019t go well, and when they do go well.\n\nIf it\u2019s Iot going well, you\u2019ll think \u201cwhy am I taking all the risk here, and she gets to have a steady income and continue to vest at the same rate as me?\u201d Conversely, if things go well, you may be prone to think \u201cwhy does she get so much equity when she isn\u2019t even full time?\u201d\n\nBe thoughtful in how you approach it. I\u2019ve been in both situations, and it can be hard. The mental and emotional component is the most difficult to cope with.",

            "comment": "10% is a lot to give up. Unless she makes some sort of investment, especially after you have already raised. Giving 1% sounds like a lot unless you make her equity contingent on deals or follow-on investment. Also in your case I would be prepared to make it vest over time as well as be ready to terminate the contract within 6 months if you don\u2019t see any traction. Also if she doesn\u2019t put any money in it she can always just leave. I have a few friends who went down your path only to regret it. I don\u2019t know anyone in fact that has been happy giving up 10% for just a connection.",

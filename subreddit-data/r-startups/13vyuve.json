    "postText": "We're two co-founders in a SaaS with 2 employers: a junior IT-developer and a young digital marketeer since 2 months. Our marketeer is a young girl, combining her studies with a 3/4 parttime job with us. She looks and talks like she's quite into our project. But I feel like we have not enough insights in how she's performing actually performing\n\nSo what she does is: seek, select and create content for socials: facebook, IG and LinkedIn. She creates newletters, do some other basic visual stuff like mockups, merchandising,.. She sets up newsletters and for now, she's creating a step-by-step guide for our customers of around 25 pages. We consider the quality of her work *okay* for a junior, but it \"feels\" like it all takes very long.\n\nFor this month she worked out 6 FB/IG posts, 2 IG posts, 5 ad images and 1 ad animated video for socials. I think she has been busy for almost 2 weeks now with only the layout of the guide. The copy was delivered by us. Besides that, she made some marketing mail templates, did some merch mockups, and some few this and thats that's not worth mentioning. \n\nShe's having exams now, so we offer some flexibility in how work schedule, but also that, makes it quite difficult to make an objective view about her performances.\n\nWe're using Notion and planning tasks together, but I feel it very difficult to estimate how much time simple tasks like creating an ad visual or writing some copy text reasonable should take. I don't want to end up micromanaging or clocking her work but as for now it feels I'm just out there in the dark. \n\nAny trips or suggestions that pop-up into your minds?",

            "comment": "Best place to start is with a document you hopefully already have \u2013 a job description. Use that as a basis for gauging performance. Many startups either don't measure it at all, measure the wrong thing, or measure too much. Keep things simple at first.\n\n**eg: Creating, curating and posting high quality content  for all of our social channels**\n\nSome basic advice:\n\n1) Start by defining what \"performance\" means to you. This is important. However you define it though, it shouldn't just focus on how well someone does their job. Performance should also include how they work in a team (helping others selflessly, being supportive, listening to feedback, giving advice etc), and how they contribute to, live, and advance the culture and overall goals of the company. \n\n2) Don't focus too narrowly on the # of posts, time she takes to create content etc. What's important is progression and results. If she's only been with you for 2 months, there's room to grow. Baseline her activities right now, and then measure again at 6 months. Is she more efficient? Is she working faster, with better quality output, and with less instruction? Is there more/better quality engagement from users? You want to see momentum. \n\n3) Build a simple but meaningful grading system so everyone is clear on what's being measured and how \u2013 eg. Needs Improvement &gt; Developing &gt; Quality Solid &gt; Quality High &gt; Exceptional. Giving vague feedback like \"you're doing a shitty/fair/good/great job\" is too broad, too subjective, and not helpful.\n\nGood luck!",

What matters is her commitment to solving the problem and her learning from the failures",

We want original, quality content and I\u2019m more ok with 5 state-of-the-arts posts that took double the time than 10 mediocre posts.\nI definitely feel a way to make her grow into the business. It\u2019s not like I feel things go south at this moment, but I see the danger of not coaching her enough and eventually lose her interest in the project.\n\nThanks for the great responses!",

It's fine, but you also should be accepting that mistakes will be made and things are slower than with a more experienced person.\n\nSo for example the dev likely will make mistakes that will lead to outage or need to re-write things later.\n\nFor the marketeer, how are you doing scoping, prioritization and follow-up with her?\n\nFor example: \n\n&gt;Besides that, she made some marketing mail templates, did some merch mockups, and some few this and thats that's not worth mentioning. \n\nWhy is she working on things not worth mentioning? You possibly could get more progress if she would focus on 1-2 things at a time. Jumping between layout, mail template, mockups and other things might mean losing capacity on context switching. \n\nIf you are not doing it already, you could consider having 10 min daily standup with her. She could ask questions, clarify scope of the ongoing items, you could prioritize things. So if progress is slow, then you would have a chance to remove things from here plate or decreasing scope for an item.",

Sometimes she works a few 8 hours days and after that she\u2019s a few days not available for her studies. At this moment we have a weekly sync where we go over all the stuff she did last week and what she will do next. I didn\u2019t always set clear deadlines and maybe that something I should always do, because I can keep track of things in time. \n\nWith the \u201cfew things not worth mentioning\u201d I mean smaller stuff that doesn\u2019t takes much time. But it\u2019s a good point to think about which tasks should primarily assigned to her and maybe keep those smaller, non-recurring things on my plate to keep her tasklist clean and understandable.\n\nThanks for your perspective. Really appreciated!",

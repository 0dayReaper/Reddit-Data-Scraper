You can have an official organizational business name but your web domain &amp; website name different.",

If the .com is taken I will most likely skip ahead to something else.\n\nAlso, you should use some of the name cherckers for social media. Most businesses will need them and it is great to have them all be the same.\n\nTips aside, you could just pick a name you really like. Which is what I would recommend after spending too much time finding the perfect names. In the end,  you could probably argue that you're the only one in - your country, field of expertise, ... - or just rebrand.",

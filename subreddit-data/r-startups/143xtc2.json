Things are going great from the technical standpoint but I'm still confused on legal matters. Specifically the terms of use and a waiver to prevent users from filing law suits. \n\nI'm honestly just a broke college student and don't know if I should get a lawyer or just get a generic tos and wait until I reach a certain user base threshold before getting one. Also, how much should I pay for a lawyer for something like this if I want to get a good one but not overly expensive?",

Usually signifies 3 things:\n\n1: You haven\u2019t done enough Market Research\n2: It\u2019s a dead market\n3: It\u2019s a very new solution to a very new problem\n\nNot trying to break you down or anything ^ \n\nAs for the TOS, in the past I\u2019ve always done generic ones at the beginning with some tweaking to make sure it aligns. For my recent projects that need a TOS, I\u2019ll still tweak a generic one then run it through GPT. That should be fine. If you start getting an influx of users, then get a lawyer to draft one up but I wouldn\u2019t worry about that right now. TOS can be updated whenever you want.",

So just make sure you're not breaking local laws and you'll be ok. Later when you need some contractual guarantees to be able to sell does tos become important.\n\nIn general (I don't know your territory) you should probably incorporate. This will protect you from being sued directly. Realistically noone expects much or gives a fuck about promises from a new startup.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a second-year Computer Science student with a strong passion for programming and entrepreneurship. I've been coding since the 8th grade, mostly for personal projects, and I've also launched successful side hustles throughout high school. \n\nCurrently, I'm in the early stages of developing an MVP for a fintech startup. Despite my enthusiasm and willingness to learn, I recognize that I don't have substantial experience with large projects or professional programming roles. \n\nGiven these circumstances, I'm contemplating whether I should assume the role of CTO and learn as I go, or if it would be more advantageous to seek out a more experienced CTO or technical co-founder. \n\nMy primary concern is whether investors may view my lack of professional experience as a drawback. I would greatly appreciate any insights or advice on this matter. Thank you in advance!",

Early stage investors don't need somebody who can lay down enterprise level code, they want to see execution to test good/interesting ideas, ideally with a counterpart with complementary skills, probably business/bizdev/marketing. Either you grow into the role you're envisioning or good investors help you find that person later.",

Experience would help them navigate security / liability pitfalls. \n\nThey probably dont have the liquidity required to hire external legal or IT security council, so they should tread lightly and probably NEED outside investment, which is not a great place to start at",

Perhaps there's a professor at your university who used to be a CTO in industry who'd be willing to help out?\n\nThe main counterargument is whether that's what the startup needs. You're going to need someone focusing on the business side of things, and you won't be able to be both a CTO and a CEO.",

Founders bring more than just the skill, it\u2019s the passion and the will to succeed. I remember many times the threat my partner (who was the CTO) made of \u201cI will just do it myself\u201d, or challenging the chief architect with \u201cwell you could do it this way\u201d when they had all these reasons why something would take too long or whatever. They never wanted him to jump in (because his code was kinda shitty) but they knew they couldn\u2019t BS him and he could understand all the decisions being made. Basically he became the owner of balancing speed/quality and also translating customer demands (product manager really, looking back). It worked out ok, he\u2019s now the CTO inside of the huge company that bought us of our own of team and the team they combined under him (around 30 engineers under his leadership). You can bet almost all of them are better in their specialties than he is, but he still sees the customer needs as primary and can sit between business results and technical implementation. Just recently he coded up a demo, just to remind the new people he can still do it.",

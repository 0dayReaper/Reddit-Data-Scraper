It's all about a smart approach that can help startups and businesses shine by finding new, untapped opportunities.\n\nHas anyone here read 'Blue Ocean Strategy' or used its ideas in their business? I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences.\n\nDo you know any successful companies that have used this strategy?",

Sometimes though all the execution in the world will be for naught because it's just an infeasible business model. I've come across three companies in the last ten years trying to be a marketplace for borrowing high end clothes. It's just not a market that you can scale and make good $ with. Same with the delivery businesses. Uber eats, Instacart, Doordash.. they're all still losing $ despite $billions in revenue. And those are companies that have competition and $ in them (for now). Imagine building something that has already had 100 startups doing the same thing, all of which have vanished. If you encounter a \"blue ocean\" or an \"oasis\" there's a good chance it's actually a tar pit. So do your due diligence before wasting thousands or tens of thousands of $ and a year of your life and your partners' lives.",

There are many pitfalls and the way you setup your analysis is actually the most critical part.\n\nThe analysis fully depends on how well you know your business, competitors, potential new entrants, etc. So very often, people with these knowledge don't actually need the book.\n\nThe main value is (IMHO) to offer a framework to innovate on existing business models and create a moat in an otherwise challenging business.\n\n**TL;DR I recommend it. It's a useful tool in your toolbox.**",

It\u2019s been awhile since my last reading of it, but I thought this was intended more for mature/larger companies kinda \u201cstuck\u201d, trying to solve for re-energizing growth, expanding market share, etc. It spurred conversations around identification of new products, market segments, etc. and testing new business models. In addition, if I\u2019m not mistaken, the research basis for the book focused more so on corporate examples as well. \n\nMy hot take is that most successful startups follow some sort of blue ocean footprint whether they realize they\u2019re doing it or not.

It's a company.\n\nAnyone building products with OpenAI's proprietary software is in a red ocean because of how low the barriers to entry are. Get an API key and be an \"AI entrepreneur\".\n\nAnother thing would be to create a new deep learning model and train it from scratch, something that very few people are actually doing (e.g. Midjourney). But the people who do it ultimately end up rich.\n\nI'm honestly fed up of all these \"chatgpt extensions\". I keep using the normal ChatGPT because of how little value all these extensions add. The real juice and value is in ChatGPT and you can't change that unless you install a chip in my brain, which I won't accept anyway.\n\nAnd as I said, if you can use OpenAI's API keys, so can anyone else. It's not a unique differentiator that's gonna make you somehow successful because anyone else with some development skills can do the same.",

I don't recommend focusing your eyes on GPT only as there are other technologies available that the media is not yet talking about.",

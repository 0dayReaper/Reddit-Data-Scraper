    "postText": "I have been working on a tech side project for the past year, and have found PMF. The pull for the product has been cool to feel, and a lot of keep track of! My co-founder and I are now looking to move onto the project full-time (ie seeking investment now).\n\nWe are located in the southeast, and while we love living here, and costs are low, the angel network seems very limited. We are beginning to put together our first round, and I was wondering how others in our position have networked with angels either in the southeast, or elsewhere. Are there networks or conferences in this region we should be connected to/attending? It seems the mindset of SE investors are VERY different than those out west. Given we are both still FTEs, navigating how to do the round, while still growing the business is a bit daunting. So just looking for some general advice.\n\nTIA!",

I am currently in florida, although I will be moving at some point out west, but I have talked to a few people around these parts trying to start companies and basically the investment network here is non existent unless you are maybe in miami.  \n\nAlso the challenge with starting a business in certain places is its much more difficult to find help such as technology.  So the growth is much slower.  So the investers will be more about enterprise companies.  Or maybe non tech.\n\nSome states have a non existent network because they have a non existent business ecosystem.  So either you have to move or you just have to work with what you have,",

You might find a few networks around.  Or maybe in other nearby states.  But depending on your product you probably will need to search elsewhere.",

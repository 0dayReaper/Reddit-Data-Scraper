    "postText": "Pull up a chair family!\n\nI\u2019m going to peel back the layers to show that this stuff is actually doable.  And while we\u2019re not making 10\u2019s of millions like some other apps yet, I think we have a real path to get there. We\u2019re growing at a measured and manageable rate, are completely bootstrapped, have not taken on a penny of investment, have zero debt, healthy margins, and own 100% of the company.\n\nThis is a post on how I did it. \n\n(Read time: ~15 minutes).\n\nRevenue upfront:  (Had an imgur link to revenue but mods made me remove it) (You can click the links and see our numbers updated in real time as well on baremetrics. I know the skepticism is real on Reddit lol.) \n\nQUICK BACKSTORY AND HOW I FIGURE OUT WHAT TO BUILD!\n\nSo I wanted to build an app for a local service business. i.e An app that cleaning companies and lawncare companies and painting companies etc. would use. I already owned a local service business and felt I could create something that first would be a tool that I could use and then make it available for other people if it worked out. (Super awesome if you could be customer #1 for what you're building).\n\nAnyhow, when appraising an idea I use this point system I came up with and assign points  based on the following metrics:  \n \n1) 10 points if there is a LOT of competition doing the same thing   \n2) 10 points if you can point to folks making MILLIONS!  \n3) 10 points if it's a service/software instead of product   \n4) 10 points if you can get customers 60 days from now   \n5) 10 points if there is a chance for automatic recurring revenue   \n6) 10 points if the price of the thing is over $50   \n7) 10 points if the thing is unsexy, boring, but people NEED it    \n8) 10 points if it's something you've bought yourself   \n9) 10 points if the thing is less than 13 ozs (If it's a product) or you can divorce it from your time if it's a service .    \n10) 10 points if you can explain what it is in 5 words and a 5 year old would understand.    \n\n====   \nClosest to 100 wins!  \n====  \n\nSo in my case building an app for local service companies scored a 90 on this scale. The only thing missing was that it would take a little more than 60 days to get our first customer, but because I was already running a local business and had put out a ton of content around local,  I already had customers lined up even before the first version of the product was complete. \u2190- Can\u2019t stress how important this is, and you\u2019ll see why soon.\n\nOKAY SO HERE'S WHAT I DID TO GET MOVING:\n======================================\n\n**STEP 1: FIND A TECHNICAL CO-FOUNDER**   \nIf you can code you can skip this step and code that bad boy yourself, but I knew I would need a technical co-founder.  I reached out to a friend whose husband was a developer, and told him what I wanted to build.  At first he wasn\u2019t interested, so I decided to do it myself (not like I\u2019m going to live forever lol) and made a post on Upwork to find a developer.  My taking action on it changed his mind, and he came on board, things worked out, and he has since quit his job and works on the app full time. \n\n**STEP 2: FINDING A DEVELOPER**  \nUpwork. That\u2019s it.  I made a post, outlining what I was looking for and tried to find the single best person I could find with the most completed projects and the highest ratings.  They started out at $35 per hour. Bonus if you can give them a small project first to make sure they complete things on schedule, communicate well, have good availability etc. But once we figure that out, it\u2019s on.  Our investment (and the only investment we ever made) was $5,000 each between me and my partner. \n\n**STEP 3: CREATE SPECS**   \nThis doesn\u2019t have to be a really complicated process in the beginning. I simply put together how I wanted things to flow with a few screenshots for visual aids and explanation and that was that.  It helps to go through every single app you can find in the space to get some ideas. Here\u2019s the actual \u201cspecs\u201d I wrote out that the developer started with: &gt;&gt;&gt; (Had an imgur link to specs but mods made me remove it)\n\nOf course as things got going we got more complex, but this was legit how things started.\n\n**STEP 4: LAUNCH CONTENT**  \n\nYou need content.  I don\u2019t care what you\u2019re selling. I never launch a business with ads. Instead by creating a content around the product you can start a two-way conversation with your audience, get to figure out what they are looking for, what makes them tick, and start to build your audience.  I had put out a ton of content on local a WHOLE year before the app was even conceived (contrary to what folks with fuzzy memories think) and then started to put out more when I knew it was going to be a thing.\n\n**STEP 5: FINDING FIRST CUSTOMERS**  \n\nIf you made sure you\u2019re building something that people need, if you\u2019ve nurtured and connected with those folks for months before the launch, have put out solid content, and have kept folks excited along the way, you WILL get customers on launch day. But your app isn\u2019t going to be beautiful yet (and you shouldn't wait until it's beautiful to launch), and folks won\u2019t mind as long as the main functions are there.  \n\nSo what I said was:\n\n1) We\u2019re going to be pricing this product at $x price per month.   \n2) We\u2019re going to be adding a ton of features     \n3) Sign up now while it's still ugly at a discounted price, like 60% of $x and you\u2019ll be grandfathered in at that price forever and take advantage of all the sweet updates and additional features at no additional cost.   \n\nThis works like a charm!\n\nIMPORTANT: So the revenue from first customers pays for ongoing development and we never had to put any more money into the platform!!!!!\n\n**STEP 6: NOT WORRYING ABOUT IDEA GETTING STOLEN**\n\nSee the first section in Step 5. You can\u2019t do this by trying to build in secret. As a matter of fact when I\u2019m building something I want to tell as many people as possible to get feedback, get buy-in, and making sure I\u201dm not building into a black hole.  I want people anxiously waiting and knocking down my door before the thing is even done.  Building it in secret (and nobody is waiting to buy at launch) is a much bigger risk to me than any thoughts of the \u201cidea being stolen\u201d.  \n\n**STEP 7: THE STORY-TELLING ARC**\n\nBeyond launch content it\u2019s incredibly important to tell the story of the brand.  Every brand story is different, but there are certain stories that really resonates with people.  Think of how many brands that tell their story of having \u201cstarted in a garage\u201d.  If this is your story, don\u2019t hesitate to tell it. People often buy story more than they buy the actual thing. Be transparent and honest and human and your thing will connect. Here\u2019s a tiny bit of the story telling arc around myself and this project &gt;&gt;&gt; (Had an imgur link to storytelling arc but mods made me remove it)\n\n**STEP 8: BUILDING COMMUNITY**\n\nSo as we put out content, told our story, worked on the app, and folks on our platform started to see success, we knew we had to build a community.  For us, and I think this is critical, we look to build a Facebook group or subreddit or forum or whatever we can think of for any product or service we put out.  This helps with feedback, first adopters, testers for new features, and folks help each other out thus helping with customer support. And of course folks post their results which acts as inspiration for everyone else. \n\n**Step 9: TESTIMONIAL MARKETING**\n\nBy now you have folks on the app that are doing well, you need testimonials.  Think of going to a restaurant without first checking out their Yelp reviews. Or watching a movie without checking out Rotten Tomatoes (well this is me at least haha).  But this is human. People need to know that other people use it and are happy with it. \n\nThere are multiple types of testimonials but the ones that work best for us are these:\n\nType 1: More serious Video testimonials (We just hire a videographer on Craigslist for like $150 in our customer\u2019s city and send them to our client\u2019s home so it looks professional). Don't want to post one of these because it's too much like an ad.\n\nType 2: More fun: Video testimonials (One of our clients and my friend just did this on her iphone with a random dude recording in the park LOL) (Had a link to video but mods made me remove it)\n\nType 3: Candid - Screenshots from our Facebook group to show community and that folks help each other.\n\n**STEP 10) WEBINAR MARKETING**\n\nThis is just another more formal way of telling your brand story, showing testimonials, highlighting your community, and extending your brand.  So at this point you have all those items in place, and a webinar presentation allows you to wrap everything up in a nice neat bow for people live and in real time. \n\nHere is a snippet of actual slides from one of our webinars: \n\n(Had a link to a short snipped of slides but mods made me remove it)\n\n**DEMOGRAPHICS;**\n\nSo a lot of our first customers were from Reddit but we've since grown so far beyond that.  Folks on the app sell everything local imaginable, from cleaning to bike repair, to auto detailing, to even babysitting and we have a ton of existing companies that came over from other platforms.  \n\n===============================\nSo that\u2019s the core of the thing and I\u2019m happy to answer any questions I can answer on this process. There are a gazillion opportunities to build improvements on existing apps by niching down into one particular vertical, by niching down by location, or in some other way.  Not everything has to be \u201csuper scaleable $100 million dollar home-run\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m sure many of you have the skills to build a simple app, bring in a nice 6 or 7 figure check every year, and go sit on the beach somewhere if you would like.\n\n2019 is as good a year as any to make it happen!\n\n====\nAnd as usual I like to post the companies we use when I post these case studies but mods made me remove the list.\n\nYep, 2019 is the year I get into the fitness space. Stay tuned...\ud83d\ude09\n\n========\nSo I know reddit is the land of cynics, naysayers, back-seat drivers etc.  I tried to remove anything from this that even seems like an ad for the app (If I missed something let me know and I'll remove that too), but Im not going to spend my xmas eve going back and forth with random weird stuff, lol I'd rather just delete it and go play spades or something. lol  \n---\nBut if you have any questions on the development process, time to first customers, ramping things up, sales, marketing, how we approach growing it, content distribution, or anything like that fire away and I'll respond!\n",

Regarding stripe, how competitive do you find their offering compared to the likes of PayPal or WorldPay? If you could go back would you pick stripe given what you've learned since? If not why not?",

And they are cool to work with, responsive enough, and  after you hit certain volume points you can negotiate discounts.  Haven't had any issues with them that would make me go with someone else if I had to start over. ",

This will depend on what you're building.  \n3) Once you have #1 and #2 your job is to:    \nA) Start conversations with them before you even start building.  \nB) Make sure what you're thinking about building is something they need badly enough to pay for it.    \nC) Start posting content like how they could get into the space that will end up with them needing the app, or showing folks that are already in that space how the app will absolutely change their lives.  Bonus points if you have something where you can illustrate it in a hodge podge way before the app is even done. i.e Look how this discount code strategy worked for me using google drive, a wp plugin, and gift cards!!!! Well I'm going to package everything into an app that does it automatically for you. ",

For me it would be something like this:   \n1) Post to my Facebook page: \"hey guys, I know I haven't been around as much but I've spent the last 9 months working on a crazy project.  It's my first mobile app and here's what it does [insert what it does].  Would love to show you a sneak peek if you think it might be useful for you, or even just to get your feedback.  Here's the inner circle group for it &gt; link to group.  \n\n2) Then in the group you want to be super transparent about what you're building, how you built it and get feedback, and get people to invite friends, and put out update videos etc. before launch day.  Do this well and some folks in the group will even help you with launch.  \n\n3) outside of the group you want to find where most of the customers hang out. is it tech forums, hacker news, medium, twitter, instagram. Where is it? There is a place you just need to find that place. And there you become a member of the community, be extremely valuable, and find ways to get feedback.  \n\n4) And then for big content pieces I would look at the type of content the most successful company in the space puts out and go from there.  Success leaves a roadmap.\n\n",

Or did you mean that you wanted your app service an industry that has lots of competition? Sorry, I'm just not super clear on it.\n\nAnyway, thanks again, when I am a bit more settled in my freelance income I want to dedicate some time to starting a business that is able to go on to make me some money independent of my time such as yours!

Scariest thing ever (at least for me it was lol), but things can really work out if the cards play themselves right. \n\nQuestion on competition: Yep, the prevailing ideas are \"make sure no one else is doing the same thing\". From my experience quite the opposite has proven to be fruitful for me. Reasons why I like there to be a lot of competition:  \n1) I know it's a real business and people are making a ton of money.  This tells me that there is money for me to make if I jump in as well.  \n2) Success leaves a roadmap. I can look at the most successful people in the space and see that roadmap. What content do they post, how many times they post on social media, what does their marketing funnel look like etc.  I can't get those answers if I'm the first person trying to cross the Antarctic by myself. I want to know 1000 people have gone before me and made it!   \n3) It makes marketing easier since I don't have to do as much education. I can say \"Oh we're like Uber for massages\" or something (bad example but you get what I'm saying) without having to spend so much time educating customers once we find them.  \n\nSo with those reasons, I've found that making sure there is plenty of thriving competition in a space is one of the best predictors of how successful my company will be.",

Do you look through particular parts of the app store? Or something else?

I know it's hard to answer this because it entirely depends on the idea haha, but just wondering if you had a metric for this or if its based on research or just something you just KNOW? ",

Over time I just figured it out.  It's like starting with not being able to ride a bike, then being able to ride, then being able to wheelie, and then being able to do crazy stunts.  And it's really just watching/reading/learning about how someone else did it, and then putting it into action and trying things out myself. And you're very welcome. :-)",

Industry: local services, I mention some of the verticals in the post.  Price levels start at $59, then $99 and then $199 I think, it was completely arbitrary, wish I could tell you there was some fancy formula to find those prices but there wasn't. We just kinda did what felt right and made sure the competition was in the ballpark.  I would have to dig up customer retention but it's long because there's a lot of stickiness to the app for vendors that are making money. We're processing $60 million in revenue per year for our customers at this point.",

I would look at the thing that you have the closest acumen to, see what apps are out there killing it in that space (like making a rack of money) and start to think about how you can niche down to a specific vertical, niche geographically, or just add a more up-to-date startup vibe to old traditional services. I call it startup glitter, where you take an old school service and target it to millenials. For example, a regular boring thing like insurance becomes something cool like: https://www.lemonade.com/",

    "postText": "Hey fellas! First of all, thanks for reading this, I\u2019m truly going through a really tough and weird week, one of the worst ones since I\u2019ve started my company so far\u2026 Here\u2019s why:\n\nAbout 2 months ago I \u201cclosed\u201d (see quotes) a deal with an investor. We agreed that it would be instrumented via SAFE, and the timeline would be somewhere around 2-3 weeks (still thought this was a little too long but meh) to have everything completed and the money wired to our account.\n\n3 weeks ago I get the \u201cSAFE\u201d agreement, which did not look like a SAFE at all. It was a very convoluted, looooooong document (20 pages long) with a LOT of super weird shit\u2026 After some back and forth we agree to remove some of the shit, not all, and my lawyer says \u201cyou know what this is going to be as good as it gets with these folks, if you want the money sign it, otherwise just walk away\u201d\u2026 I said whatever and agreed that I would sign it\u2026\n\nFor the past 3 weeks I\u2019ve been trying to get them to send the \u201cSAFE\u201d via Docusign to no avail\u2026 They articulated excuses ranging from \u201cthe CEO is sick and cannot sign\u201d up to \u201cSilicon Valley Bank bla bla bla\u2026\u201d \n\nYesterday I get the SAFE with a note saying that every existing SAFE holder would have to sign it as well, otherwise there was no deal\u2026 First of all, we had been going back and forth for pretty close to a month, and this is the first time they told me this, and second, I spoke to my previous investors and ALL OF THEM said \u201cf?ck no, we are not signing anything, SAFEs are signed by founders, you do not need our signature so we are not doing it\u201d.\n\nNow, I had never heard in my life that a SAFE for a small pre seed investment had to be signed by previous SAFE holders as well. I might be wrong but this seems highly unusual, and it actually put me on high alert\u2026\n\nWhat the hell is going on? Believe me this is a SMALL check, why is all of this happening? A 20 page long SAFE where they need a signature from previous SAFE holders? Why would they wait until the last minute to tell me that they needed previous SAFE holder\u2019s signatures? I\u2019m afraid this deal is going to fall through since my previous investors said there is no way they are signing anything\u2026\n\nAny insights? Literally WTF? Any help will be greatly appreciated, my lawyer is baffled, says he\u2019s never seen this crap before and I most definitely haven\u2019t either\u2026 \ud83d\ude22",

And you can't create growth while running at a deficit.\n\nIt's so hard to compare the value of different resources against each other, and especially inexperienced founders disregard the non-monetary ones in favor of money. But you have to take that step back and take in the bigger picture, and extrapolate. Like, will including these people, just to get their money, really help you create the position that you want to be in 3 months, and 3 years, into the future?\n\nAlso, remember that people like these always will come prepared with documents that are in their favor. So they'll set the rules for the negotiations. If you know what type of deals that you are willing to offer it doesn't hurt to come prepared with your own documents. You'll need a lawyer involved anyways, so start out by having your own SAFE agreement created. Something very basic and to the point. And then you have that sent as part of even just the discussions. \"This is what we're looking for, this is what we're offering, and this is it in writing. If you can accept this the offer is valid until \\[date\\].\"",

Therefore ALL AND EVERY stockholder will be responsable for financially compensating the Investor even if securities had not converted yet.\n\nBecause they included a broadened and expanded liability clause that includes my previous investors they need them to sign, otherwise with just my signature their acceptance of that liability would be null.

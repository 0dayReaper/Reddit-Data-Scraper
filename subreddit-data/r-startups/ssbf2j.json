At first I was like: Wow, great guy, he made it from nothing.  \nThen he said: \"I dropped out of college and was traveling all around the world...\" Wait a minute, I google his father and his father is a founder of 3 multi-million dollar companies.\n\nThis is not the only example.  \nElon Musk - Had a rich father  \nMate Rimac (guy who made the fastest electric car in the world) - father was rich  \n[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/31/small-business-entrepreneurs-success-parents](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/31/small-business-entrepreneurs-success-parents)\n\nIt even goes beyond tech, like Ed Sheeran and Ariana Grande, come from rich parents.\n\nThey all definitely worked hard for success, but when you have a rich background, no need to worry about job, rent, food or education, you can do so much more, focus your mind wherever, invest money, invest time...\n\nI used to be very motivated by the fact that anyone can succeed, but is seems to me like there is always something that happened behind the scenes that nobody talks about",

Information is out there and these folks not only have access to the free information, but probably have these discussions over dinner giving them a better edge. Additionally, not only have a safety net, but suspect their wiring is different about risk because they may have never had to scrap for food. I can't explain this, but see that a lot of marginalized communities themselves aren't familiar with navigating the system and as a result miss out on free information and solid networks.",

I had to turn down offers of jobs on actual movies (like the first X-Men) because it was unpaid and I had to pay for myself to get to and stay in the filming locations. I was paying my way through college with 3 jobs so that wasn\u2019t going to happen. \n\nThen in senior year my thesis teacher thought I showed a lot of promise as a filmmaker and suggested I focus on it rather than the jobs I had to go to\u2014and when I explained to him that I, y\u2019know, HAD to have those jobs, not just to eat and commute and have a roof over my head but also afford equipment and film stock and be able to feed my small crews, etc.-he was absolutely baffled. Because the whole system is set up by and for people who simply do not need to worry about bare necessities, and those with surpluses are able to put in more time and afford better resources than \u201cregular\u201d people. \n\nEven without the extra money, exposure to contacts who can get you in the door or advise you is absolutely crucial. I\u2019m hoping the fact that we all now carry small studios in the palms of our hands and have relatively democratic platforms like YouTube/TikTok/Instagram is greatly helping regular people make what they want and get exposure.",

To really make it you need to focus on your venture 100%, if you have a wealthy background you can just drop out of everything and work on your venture, it's comfortable since you're not really risking anything per se if all fails you can just get back to work, while if you're not coming from a wealthy background you just have to risk something to \"go all in\" it might be savings, relationships or life in general since to really focus you have to make more time (a lot more time) after your 9to5 and on your weekends or cut back on your general expenses and sacrifice your savings if you decide not to work\n\n\n2. Connections - usually coming from a wealthy background also suggests you have at least some connections to the right people, it's definitely helpful when you need to raise funds.\n\n\n3. Education - I really think this is key, there's a lot of upside on \"growing\" rich and especially when one of your parents owns a business, there are things related to running a business that one can simply not learn anywhere formal IMHO.",

It\u2019s a journey. It is not a straight line. And he came out a billionaire.\n\nHis father had a fortune of $900 million, gave his son a $100 million literal tax-free 'loan', and the man has still gone bankrupt 3 times (I'm still honestly surprised this isn't brought up more. Who loses money building casinos, outside a straight recession???). What's the success? That he managed to print his name on everything, in an attempt to be considered high-class? The only thing he can honestly claim he did on his own was winning the Presidency, and I'm not even sure I can say that with a straight face. (I would love to see the Sliding door side where the FBI **doesn't** release the Muller report until after the election, as they always did until that point.)\n\nYou can't say he's a billionaire. You have no proof. The only people who even claims he's a billionaire are all on his payroll, or parroting what he's saying to gain his favour. There is not one viable independent report that states he's billionaire rich.",

            "comment": "My father came from a poor family in a small town in Canada. His father was a certified genius who had plenty of knowledge but was brutally  poor. My father worked hard every day of his life to get out of this situation, and he never wanted his kids to endure that kind of hardship. He became an executive and worked 80 hour weeks, flew from Atlanta to NYC every week for work for years. Although he didn't save a lot of money for his retirement, we had a lot of nice things when I was a kid, and my parents paid for private school for me. They also did a savings program (Florida Prepaid) that allowed them to save for my college, so I was set for that.\n\nMy dad gave me the book \"The Richest Man in Babylon\" when I was about 12. He taught me how to start my own business mowing lawns and washing cars. He forced me to do that shit. He taught me about compound interest.\n\nI didn't want to work as hard as my dad had worked, so I decided I was going to learn how to delegate stuff. I studied engineering because I found it fascinating, and ended up in tech. When I got into tech I had to compare myself to my dad - when he was 25 he was managing an entire team and here I had an entry level job. Because I compared myself I subconsciously felt more driven to make money, and my boss noticed. My boss took me under his wing and I worked really hard. I succeeded.\n\nFrom that first success, the ball of success kept rolling forward until I surpassed my dad's income level by 10x. We now see each other as equals and he's proud of what I've done.\n\nThat dynamic, and that supportive environment from an early age, is why I attribute my success to my Dad - his drive, coming from a poor family, his expectations, the support he gave me over the years and the guidance. He saw my potential when I never saw my own. Being a natural nerd I never believed in myself but he believed in me.\n\n\\---\n\nUs humans have naturally brittle psyches, and you're right, having a safety net helps. This is also why I believe universal basic income would be good for the economy.\n\nAlthough it makes it easier (me having a rich dad), it is not a requirement if you're willing to put in the hard work and believe in YOURSELF (i.e. my dad rising from poverty.)\n\nI don't want to tell the world I did this myself. It was a team effort. Now I can help my dad retire and repay him for all he did for me. I think a lot of successful families think of themselves as a sort of team.",

That's easier when you have a safety net or little expenses, that could just be an upper middle class upbringing with college paid for and free room and board if you're young. Even easier if your family comes from money, that adds maybe a seed round. Even more money? That adds investor connections, people doing \"favors\", introductions to people that a normal person can't reach, etc. etc.\n\nIf you don't come from that you probably already had to work out of school debt, save enough to be comfortable taking a risk, being in a family position to take the risk, and then executing perfectly until you have enough real traction to get investors to reply to your emails.\n\nNot impossible, but just much harder. I say this as someone who has pursued it from the upper middle class starting point (i.e. no parents money for a seed round but if we messed up big at worst I would have been debt free applying for jobs as a software engineer).",

And I will say that it is insanely difficult, painful and scary to act and no one cares about you. Do you know how many times I applied to Y-Combinator, justifying my startup as detail as possible? 7 times. Before that, 8 years ago, I knocked on their door, explaining what a boom awaits those who look towards the NFT (Well, then I called it differently with game development) and all I got was a refusal on the very last day of their decisions. That is, they didn\u2019t even consider me and this auto-reply was sent en masse to everyone without even looking)\n\nIf you are nobody, you don't have rich parents/relatives, the chance that you will succes is about 0.5% at best. And this is not related to your failed idea, whether you are a good or bad technical founder, and so on, your startup simply will not live to the point where it will attract at least someone's attention.\n\nAs is often said, search by the FFF rule. A great idea when you live in Pervomaisk Ukraine and in order to collect the first round of investments under the FFF rule, you need the whole city to dump its salary for the year.

So yes, these are the realities... I am pulling my startup, but I can\u2019t do much with MVP, because the company itself costs a lot of money by the standards of Ukraine and I myself don\u2019t know how much I can do in this vein. In America or Europe, this is a little easier, the salaries are different and you can do a lot of things in the garage (After all, when the salary and prices are in dollars, it's much easier).",

If you come from a multimillion dollar household for example, you are already taught at an early age \"this is possible... and I need to do this...\" It's a mentality of success, stability, and support. Naturally taking more risks in a smart way is something these individuals understand  early on. \n\nThere are few concrete rags to riches stories but yes they do exist. However, it IS simplified if coming from an already successful and wealthy family. \n\nAge is the number one factor to lifetime success. The earlier you start the better (Warren Buffet started at age 10... different time thought I know). \n\nSo is success tied to having wealthy parents?? Yes, absolutely! Wealthier parents output wealthier children. Poorer Parents tend to output equal if not poorer children. It's a statistical probability. Hence Jaden Smith is an actor and has a net worth of an est. $8 million and your neighbors have equal if not less successful children. Children of doctors are likely to become doctors... children of lawyers are likely to become lawyers.. children of parents making minimum wage are likely to make minimum wage... parents who have poor debt habits are likely to have children with the same habits. \n\nI say \"likely\" because it is not guaranteed. It just means if you are born within in a less fortunate family, you need to work twice as hard and be twice as smart just to fall on par with more fortunate families. But, if you do... your children wont need to work as hard as you did... generational wealth.",

Then I have friends who grew up unimaginably rich (for where we live, like almost a half billion), and they literally do absolutely nothing.\n\nIt gives a huge leg up, but it doesn't define success.\n\nIn reality, it is easier to set your kid up for success more-so than you. Most of these super wealthy people grew up in middle to upperclass families.

    "postText": "I work in the water treatment industry and in the last decade have discovered a need that is not being fulfilled on a national level in the United States. My idea involves data aggregation across various data sets, mapping it and then packaging it as a stand-alone access point for the data, as it relates to marketing, strategy and growth for business like the one i currently work in.   \nBut now what?  \n\n\nI do not have the technical know-how on how to build this or even aggregate and translate the data into a perceptible fashion. I know enough to be dangerous, but not enough to do the work. I don't have any capital or money raised for the project, so I think seeking investors is a good idea, but how do I do that?   \n\n\nThanks everyone in advance for advise.",

            "comment": "Great observation. There are many data points not being utilized to their potential in the environmental industry as a whole. I'm working on a platform to help address that myself. \n\nHere is my advice. Take it as you may. Not intending to be a jerk. \nIdeas are cheap and plentiful. For what you want to create, you're going to need A TON of help because it's so damn complex and interconnected. Is there value in it, I'm sure there is. Your challenge is 2 parts, funding and technical knowledge. \n\nFunding - investors are very cautious right now. You'd be a non-technical founder with no experience starting and selling a company. You're probably a SME in a niche area with a great idea, but investors have a hard time letting money go without seeing evidence of past experience using investor $ or paid users and a growth track. \n\nTechnical knowledge - If you can't build the platform yourself, you need to find someone to partner with that 1. Knows how to build what you envision. 2. Can speak non -technical language with you as you try to solve client problems and actually run and operate the business. \n\nIn my opinion, find a small problem to solve besides \"data aggregation\" and find someone to help you build something people are willing to pay for. If you can achieve some growth with something simple, the doors you want to open will be easier, even if the simple problem is limited in scope. \n\nBaby steps - don't worry about anyone stealing your idea. Ideas are cheap. People get paid because they can execute their idea better than others.",

Not all solutions of this pattern are profitable. I would consider costs vs revenue, some starting points are\n\n* Costs\n   * Access to the data?\n   * Cost to collect any missing portions?\n   * Data query cost? i.e. is this a NP/'traveling salesman' type problem?\n   * Standard marketing, licensing etc. that all business need &amp; you called out\n* Revenue\n   * Target market? B2B, etc.\n   * Expected revenue per sale?\n   * Expected number of sales?\n\nIf you 'know enough to be dangerous', you probably know enough to make a POC with dummy data. Just make a few fake data sets and see how far you get. This could be enough to get an investor.\n\nOnce armed with a POC, find an engineer who can be your tech lead / CTO. You're the subject matter expert and CEO. Then write a business plan and start looking for investments",

You may be able to attract someone right now but without any work or investment that isn\u2019t likely and they probably wouldn\u2019t be the best quality CTO.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t become more respected and credible to attract a high quality CTO though. Some things you can do to make yourself more attractive:\n\n1. Make a business model/plan\n2. Make a wire-frame for your platform\n3. Design your platform\n4. Make a MVP for your platform \n5. Get some traction/sign-ups or early adopters \n6. Get a comprehensive marketing plan\n\nThe more that you can do to validate your idea and show that you have put work in and are dedicated to your idea the easier it\u2019s going to be to convince someone to join. \n\nThink about it from their perspective, they are much more likely to join when they see you are dedicated.\n\nMost of all you just don\u2019t want them to think of you as only the \u201cidea guy\u201d",

You have none. The business needs labor, in this case tech savvy labor which is not how you describe yourself. If the business finds capital and labor, what else does this business need? Sales? Distribution? You need to find your role, define what you bring to the table. If you had the capital, would you give it to a person without the skill set to run the business? If you had the skill set, would you work for somebody without any capital to pay you? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would start this business in a second. It can be a brilliant business to get into now, that is why I know that plenty of people with plenty of money started these businesses a year ago.",

You'll probably find at least one willing to pilot with you, which is awesome for user feedback and future updates after the minimum viable product heads their way. Take this as your green light and start looking at your dev options. You may be able to build this through joint research with a university.Or hire a Developer on a contract. You could identify a co-founder with these skills. Get your costs to build together, then see what grants are available in the water space, perhaps under the ESG lens you'll find something. Or invest your own funds/take on a loan/bring on an investor/crowd fund, but most important thing is to have someone willing to pay for a solution to the problem you are solving. That greenlights everything.",

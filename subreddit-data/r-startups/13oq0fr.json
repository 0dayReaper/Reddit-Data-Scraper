    "postText": "Hey guys!\n\nThis is my first try at creating something from nothing and I'm little divided.\n\nI created a hardware product that is new to the market. It has something to do with self improvement without getting into much detail.\n\nI made a landing page that as far as I know and because of the feedback of my friends looks \"whoa, are you sure you made this?\", and then started to advertise this landing page on Facebook and Instagram to see how many subscribers I would get.\n\nThe plan was to see if the idea is good enough for Kickstarter at some point.\n\nWell the results are in, and out of 210 visitors I received 10 emails which turns out to 4.7% convertion rate.\n\nIs this good? Bad? Good enough? Considering I did this \"cold\" and without any previous organic marketing.\n\nHopefully I choose the correct sub for this question.\n\nThank you a million!",

First of all, you should consider not only conversion from landing visitor to lead but also a conversion from add view to landing visit.\n\nIt could turn out that the acquisition cost for your product is too high, and the targetable market is too low. You should estimate the market size before moving further.\n\nThe landing page lead test also doesn't tell you anything about the user\u2019s willingness to pay",

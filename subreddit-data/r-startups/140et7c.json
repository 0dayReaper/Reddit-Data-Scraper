Chance is he has followers that are in a similiar position, and if he is trustworthy to their followers then they will give you a try.\n\nOne good deal is better than 5 shitty endorsments. It\u2019s not the reach that is important but conversions to sales.",

Your best promoters are typically your own customers.\n3. Influencers are picky about what they promote. You can\u2019t just pay them and expect them to push your product to their fans. They have to genuinely like your product before they\u2019ll endorse it.\n4. Offer the influencer a cut of sales. You want them incentivized to sell\n5. Pay attention to their audience engagement, not just follower/subscriber count",

Agencies handle all the paperwork, which there's a lot to protect you -  Recorded/live/speaking/non speaking/ on camera/off camera/singing/length of time/copyright/royalties and so on and how many contracts and the deal for each. I research resources for influencers and the arts industries is how I learned.  Contacts for agencies to get started are in the Gigs section of GigsList dot Info. Hope this helps :)",

When she started using ascend viral to understand the Instagram algorithm, her influencer campaigns saw much better results. So, my advice? Make friends with the algorithm before you invest in influencer marketing. How about giving that a shot?",

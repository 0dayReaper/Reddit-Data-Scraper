    "postText": "Hi r/startups community! I'm one of the co-founders behind Ephemrial, a startup on a mission to combat the plastic crisis by developing seaweed-based bioplastic pellets that can be used in the same traditional machinery that produces plastic products.   \nWe're knee-deep in the R&amp;D phase, working our tails off to perfect our solution. But as a non-traditional startup in the sustainability realm, we've hit a classic roadblock. How do we secure early-stage capital and resources to take our game-changing idea to the next level?  \nMy last startup was a Capital Factory (Austin) Portfolio Company, so I'm aware of software &amp; hardware specific resources &amp; funds, but there does not seem to be the same level of accelerator &amp; VC support for non-traditional startups in Austin (I'd love to be wrong about that if anyone has knowledge of the scene in ATX).   \nHave any of you fellow entrepreneurs cracked the code when it comes to early capital for non-traditional startups? Maybe you've stumbled upon specific platforms, accelerators, or some out-of-the-box channels that support ventures like ours?   \nWe're looking to discover innovative ways to access the capital and resources needed to make a real dent in this plastic problem &amp; we'd hear your experiences, advice, and clever ideas. Cheers, builders.",

            "comment": "What about working with standard accelerators?  Theres also a clean tech incubator in LA.  I am forgetting the name offhand.  And theres hustle fund.\n\nI don't think this is non traditional.  Rather its just that most incubators only deal with standard tech.  But there are plenty of funds that deal with more specialty areas.  There's actually an investor in texas that invests in unusual categories.  I am forgetting the name offhand though.  Also techstars has several specialized incubators.",

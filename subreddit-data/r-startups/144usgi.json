    "postText": "I've never worked in a sale team, except a bit of door to door.\n\nI'm working on a product that would help increase the call success rate between team members.  However I have no idea how much team members need to get a hold of each other. So I made some questions here,  hopefully some people here have worked in sales teams before and can help answer them:\n\n\\- Do you or have you worked in a sales team?  \n\\- Do sales teams talk to each other a lot on the phone?  \n\\- Do they share leads with each other, and give references to each other?  \n\\- How important is timely answers from team members? i.e. Would your phone running out of power cause a lot of stress for a sale team member if they knew they missed calls from team mates?\n\n( I'm only focusing on calls coming from other team members, not from customers at the moment)  \n",

You should target customer service departments and \"inside\" sales departments for your solution. My company has an 800 number that will auto-route inbound sales inquiries to whoever is available, or direct them to the website or a chatbot. Can't think of a time when I missed a call from a hot prospect but maybe I was oblivious. Good luck.",

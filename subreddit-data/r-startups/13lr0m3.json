We're here to be heard, be understood, and be told that it'll be okay, that whatever happens, we care. Still, be tactful and classy in how you vent your feelings and share your frustrations.  Act in a mature manner. This is meant to be a safe place to support emotional and physical health and there is a zero tolerance policy in effect. Be kind.  Please report any conduct that is in violation of that key tenet.*\n\n# Howdy there. Did you have a rough week? It's certainly been a rough year. Did you get in an argument? Have a problem? Tell me about it. What's wrong?",

Me and my one friend are only one in my network who used to do this. Now its only my friend. Friend also do not have such contacts. Now we are in isolation and we don't know how do we validate the idea.",

Of course, since these are active traders - the incentive will have to be pretty good. Alternatively attend events, meetups - places where you are likely to run into them basically. \n\nI know you probably just wanted to vent, and may have even thought of these solutions. But thought I\u2019ll help. Good luck!",

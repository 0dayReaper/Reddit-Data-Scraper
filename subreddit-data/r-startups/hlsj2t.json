    "postText": "Hey all.\n\nThis is my story of how I got into YC twice, with 2 different ideas in back-to-back years. My style of entrepreneurship is different from most because I launch companies in spaces where I start with 0 domain knowledge. Here's my process.\n\n*Edit 1: Moderators removed my original post because I added some names; I removed the names .*\n\n*Note 1:* *Thank you moderators for the helpful feedback.*\n\n# Intro\n\nFrom 2018 to 2020, I launched 2 companies. Both were accepted into YCombinator. The first company was a computational drug-discovery company for Alzheimer's Disease (accepted YC S18, but now dead). The second company was a CRM for construction trade contractors (accepted YC S19). I launched both companies while I worked at Uber ATG as a software engineer building self-driving cars. In both cases, I started with 0 experience in the healthcare or construction industry.\n\nHere's my personal process for discovering ideas and getting ideas off the ground.\n\n# Talk to\u00a0people\n\nA startup succeeds by building a product that solves a problem so most first-time founders will start by asking\n\n&gt;What problem do I\u00a0solve?\n\nActually that's the wrong question to start with. The right question is\n\n&gt;What process can I follow to discover interesting problems?\n\nThe first question is difficult to answer for founders with 0 insights about an industry. To see this, try to answer the following questions for an unfamiliar industry like pest-control or waste management.\n\n* What are the interesting problems in this space?\n* Which problems will people pay money for?\n* Why do people care are about these problems?\n* What is the root-cause of these problems?\n* What do potential solutions look like and why haven't they been built?\n* How might you launch a solution and generate initial traction?\n\nMost people are stuck. The takeaway is that without insight, there cannot be innovation.\n\n*To get unstuck, talk to people.*\n\n*To find problems, talk to people.*\n\n*To generate insights, talk to people.*\n\nWhen we founded our construction tech company, my cofounder and I had 0 construction experience. To start, we sourced 20 conversations with construction experts in our network. We talked to owners, general contractors, project managers, estimators and superintendents and asked them simple questions.\n\n* What does your day-to-day look like?\n* What was something that frustrated you last week, last month?\n* Why did that process frustrate you?\n* What tools and processes do you use to get around those frustrations?\n\nVery quickly, we started hearing things like\n\n&gt;\"I hate arguing with subcontractors over percentage completed\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"I have to drive 3 hours each week to inspect the site because I'm paranoid people will slack off and take shortcuts\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"I enter in the same deadline in 3 different spreadsheets\"\n\nOver time, we heard the same stories from multiple people and these stories surfaced themes in construction: cost disputes, late payments, excessive data-entry. These same themes would go on to inspire our initial ideas.\n\nIt turns out the process for identifying promising startup ideas is not complicated. Talk to lots of people and let those conversations inspire you. This works because conversations are raw-unfiltered looks into how an industry operates. They will contain stories of day-to-day frustrations that industry experts face; these frustrations are clues for possible areas for innovation. Think of each conversation as a puzzle piece and the job of a founder as compiling those pieces into a promising startup idea.\n\nMy experiences with launching both companies have taught me that a rigorous process for learning matters far more than any single idea. A reliable process for learning enables founders to be deliberate about iterating towards good ideas, rather than leave this process to chance.\n\nWhat makes launching in non-familiar industries so difficult is the chicken-and-egg problem of \"how do I get people to talk to me and share their wisdom even if I don't have anything to offer immediately?\". I wish I had a playbook for this problem. Unfortunately, I don't because sourcing conversations is more art than science\u200a-\u200aan art that changes based on industry, a founder's network and circumstances.\n\n# Just find any reason to\u00a0launch\n\nAt some point, learning stagnates from conversations alone and you have to launch a product to actually build a company.\n\nWhile visionary founders can design products based on empathy for a specific problem and the users that face that problem, non-visionary founders must build products for unfamiliar audiences.\u00b9 As a result, the first product a non-visionary founder launches is often misguided, especially if the product is based solely on intuition from conversations. There are simply product insights that cannot be intuited from conversations alone.\n\n* Is this problem actually painful to the user or do they just think that it is?\n* Does the product solve an industry problem or just a company-specific problem?\n* Does the product solve the pain-point effectively?\n* Is the product easy to use?\n* Can the product overcome entrenched processes and gain adoption?\n\nEarly-on, non-visionary founders need a sandbox that enables them to launch products (potentially multiple), iterate and learn from users in the industry. This is another chicken-and-egg problem; you need a sandbox to learn, but it is difficult to build a sandbox if you don't have much to offer upfront.\n\nTo build sandboxes for both companies, I relied on a technique called a minimum launchable reason, which just means find any reason to launch a product/service/collaboration/project in your target industry.\n\nI used the following playbook\n\n* Use conversations to identify a industry problem\n* Look for industry partners to collaborate on solving that problem\n* Cold outreach to industry partners pitching a project\n\nIt does not matter what reason enables you to launch. All that matters is that you launch because launching enables you to learn 10x faster.\n\nFor the drug-discovery company, I launched by volunteering to do research with a computational biology lab at Carnegie Mellon University. For construction-tech company, I launched by collaborating on a robotics project with a large construction company in Pittsburgh. Building sandboxes is an art so I copied the original emails I used to build these sandboxes\n\n*(To comply with Reddit rules, I'm excluding those emails in this post)*\n\nIn my case, launching a research project the computational biology lab unlocked rich insights about designing a drug for Alzheimer's because I was able to tour biology labs, discover how data pipelines are created in biology and hear first-hand the challenges lab members had when running Alzheimer's experiments. Collaborating with a real construction company exposed me to real construction sites. I saw actual construction photos and witnessed the common spreadsheet templates that the construction industry used to document progress. If conversations are the ember sparks for startup ideas, then a sandbox ignites a raging inferno for startup ideas. With a sandbox in place, the process around innovation becomes straight-forward.\n\n* Look for problems by talking to experts and observing their day to day\n* Identify a problem\n* Launch a product\n* Gather feedback\n* Move fast and repeat until you get traction (e.g. signed LOI, revenue)\n\nWhat is non-obvious is how often early ideas will be wrong. Even more non-obvious is just how inconsequential being wrong really is. What matters is building a process around shipping products quickly because shipping unlocks learning and learning leads to good outcomes (e.g. discovering a product that is impactful). My cofounder and I did 3 product launches across 6 months before arriving at what our construction company is currently building\u200a-\u200aa CRM for trade contractors. It took us 4 months to launch our first idea (autonomous robots to scan construction sites). It took us 1 month to launch our second idea (a construction analytics platform). It took us 1 weekend to launch our third idea (a CRM for trade contractors).\n\nWe didn't necessarily get smarter each time.The key skillset we developed was shipping faster and figuring out creative ways to learn faster. Hence, the central question to ask is not\n\n&gt;Is this a good\u00a0idea?\n\nrather,\n\n&gt;What can I do to learn faster so that I can position myself to find a good\u00a0idea?\n\n# 100% Founder Conviction\n\nThe startup world points to product-market-fit as the single most important milestone for a company. I actually think the most important milestone is a concept called 100% founder conviction and it refers to the moment when the founders develop unshakable conviction that their idea will work. I didn't have 100% founder conviction for drug-discovery company, but I do for our construction company. While I cannot describe this feeling, I remember the exact moment it happened.\n\nFor months, we struggled to generate traction for our first two construction ideas. Demos were hard to come by, despite 100s of emails. I always felt like the reception to our product was lukewarm during demos. Even when we generated revenue, I felt like construction companies gave us pity deals, where the money came out of a small innovation budget used to experiment with new technologies.\n\nOur CRM idea was different. Within a week of launching, we booked a demo through a cold call with an electrical contractor! A week later, we demo'd the product and got our first signed contract. In the first month, we signed 3 customers. This was more deals than we had ever booked for all our previous ideas combined. Each sale was smooth and I felt this \"aha\" reaction from each of customer, where they nodded and said \"this is pretty useful\". Unlike our previous ideas, none of these early customers paid attention to how small we were as a company or how ugly our initial solution looked (and trust me it was ugly). All that mattered was that we solved a painful business problem and they wanted that business problem solved immediately.\n\nI suspect the 100% founder conviction stems from my personal belief that our current company is solving a real problem and that many, many people in the world have this problem. This doesn't mean that we don't face challenges.\n\n* We might fail to sell our product fast enough before we run out of money\n* We might not convince investors to give us seed capital\n* We might have trouble inspiring employees to join us\n\nThe difference is that all those challenges feel tractable. Like product-market-fit, 100% founder conviction is not quantifiable, but it's this special moment when the mindset shifts from\n\n&gt;Will this idea\u00a0work?\n\nto\n\n&gt;This idea will work. We just need to generate the proof points that will convince the world of\u00a0such.\n\nFocus on finding 100% founder conviction because the moment you find it, you'll find a way to will your company into existence regardless of obstacles.\n\n# Some advice to my younger self\n\nFor the first 7 years of my startup journey, I could never be sure if I were making progress. Lots of sleepless nights. Lots of moments where I felt like a loser, chasing impossible dreams. I'm sure a lot of founders feel this way. I'm sure a lot of successful founders once felt this way. So much of what makes startups difficult in the beginning is the psychological burden of uncertainty.\n\n* Am I making progress on my startup?\n* How should I define progress for my startup?\n* When will a promising idea appear?\n* How do I get initial traction?\n\nIf I could go back in time, I'd tell my younger self to just focus on 2 things.\n\n* **Rate of learning**: Am I learning quickly about my space and idea?\n* **100% founder conviction**: Have I found 100% founder conviction?\n\nLooking back, I wish I spent less time reading TechCrunch articles featuring big fundraises or VCs discussing post-PMF concepts (network effects, sales efficiencies, LTV/CAC) because none none of that matters in the early days. If anything, that content is detrimental for early-stage founders.\n\nI wrote this because I always wished more founders wrote about how they discovered ideas and how they generated early-traction. I wish more founders wrote about their origin stories. These stories move people and I sometimes think a dearth of these stories prevents a lot of talented people from building startups, people who could otherwise have outsized impacts on the world.",

One of the partners remembered who I was because he/she interviewed me a year ago.\n\n* We didn't come from construction.\n* I pivoted from one idea to the next in 4 months. In this time, we built a team, created a prototype and launched it.\n* The hardest part of construction is GTM and we were live on a construction site. Most companies struggle with launching in this industry.\n\n**RE: cofounding team**\n\n* I was a software engineer 1 at Uber.\n* My cofounder was a product designer at a consulting firm.\n\n**Additional info**\n\n* We didn't write any code for any of our products.\n* We built high-fidelity mockups and pre-sold our software to validate the market.\n* In YC, we pivoted 3x before arriving at our current idea, but all ideas were in construction.",

It's a really tough journey to be a founder so hopefully my experiences can help.\n\n**RE: Our work schedule**\n\nHonestly our work schedule was grueling pre-YC. My cofounder and I both kept our full-time jobs and we'd work early mornings + late nights when we'd get off our full-time jobs. Occasionally, I'd leave work for a few hours to visit a construction site, only to come back late at night to write software for Uber. If I'm speaking honestly, my full-time job performance suffered because I would work the minimal amount. That means I'd get passed on promotions and sometimes managers would wonder why I wasn't producing as much as before. Those are just some of the unspoken sacrifices that you make when trying to build your own thing. \n\n**RE: YC team size**\n\nWe were 2 cofounders. \n\n**RE: revenue**\n\nWe had pity deals of $100 committed revenue (not real traction). \n\nI'll mention one thing. I think people are misled by early traction sometimes. IMO, the actual traction itself is less important than proving that you can go out and get traction. Ideas will suck. Products will suck. But you need the ability to take your creations to market and get real feedback. If you have early-traction, then you've proven that as a founder you have the ability to sell the product and make the product come to life, which is critical skill for early-stage founders.",

You just have a better pitch, a better prototype, a better MVP, a better product/market fit hypothesis with no interest from investors.\n\nWhile on the other hand, we see RIDICULOUS startups from the result of funding, and they have ZERO clue about the customer, the market, crappy UX and almost non existent market position/differentiator and obviously have NOT exhausted the processes which you present here. \n\nI need to know what REALLY is the key activity to get things done, in regards to getting the support from neccessary actors.",

I think it might be helpful to add a few points.\n\n1. I didn't do YC for the first drug-discovery company. I got in, but my cofounder and I split the next day. YC rescinded our application. \n2. YC isn't success. Building a sustainable company and a product that customers love is what I think success is. We're not there yet.\n\nThe reason I failed at my first company was that I was a naive engineer with 0 biology experience who attempted to solve Alzheimer's. I realized I couldn't actually solve this problem given my current circumstances (0 startup successes, no domain knowledge) so I pivoted. \n\nThe reason I started our 2nd company was to accomplish 2 things\n\n* Find an idea with better idea-founder fit so I might have the privilege of doing innovation as a full-time job\n* I felt like succeeding at my 2nd idea might put me in a better position to attempt Alzheimer's down the line because I realized that you have to prove yourself as an entrepreneur first to win the world's trust &amp; resources. You do that in the biology field by being a great scientist or a proven entrepreneur like the founder of Tempus. \n\nThere's a class of founders who know they want to be entrepreneurs and love innovation, but don't necessarily have an immediate problem they want to solve. This is meant to be a resource for those types of founders.",

These flaws often require complete rewrites to fix. I\u2019ve experienced this myself at a startup (I\u2019m a developer too), and I\u2019ve seen a number of other startups encounter the same problem.  \n  \nSome of these problems can be solved through good, scalable decisions early in development, but many just can\u2019t be foreseen when you don\u2019t fully understand the scope of the project.   \n   \nThe main thing I\u2019ve learned about this: the sooner you attack these problems, the easier they are to solve. Time increases complexity exponentially, not linearly. All of this comes to a head when you sign a client that\u2019s too big for your system and you suddenly realize that a decision you made four months ago is now going to take four more months to fix (and who knows how many buggy experiences in the meantime).\n  \nBe agile. Solve the architectural issues as soon as they appear. It\u2019s better to pass on a big client that your platform isn\u2019t built for rather than sign them, scramble to accommodate them, discover a huge glaring flaw in your system, and then lose them because you couldn\u2019t fix it fast enough. Almost everyone I know in startups has had this experience. Get ahead of it as soon as you can.",

It's a big achievement and you should feel justifiably proud of the accomplishment, even if there's a long road ahead to financial success.\n\nI would like to offer a contrarian view on one of the points you make, that 100% founder conviction is essential. In my view as a cofounder of two startups (with two exits), 100% founder conviction is bad.\n\nYou describe it as the belief that:\n\n&gt; This idea will work. We just need to generate the proof points that will convince the world of such.\n\nBut a belief that your business will work, no matter what? That's based on faith rather than evidence, and that can be very dangerous: it can motivate you to do destructive or ethically compromising things when things get tough. The most popular example of this is probably Theranos, but from my advisorship and VC work I can tell you that any number of startups are plagued by similar feelings.\n\nWhat I think is better is not 100% founder _conviction_ but 100% founder _commitment_: the willpower to find the right way forward despite adversity, but _not_ to neglect evidence that's telling you things are going in the wrong direction. Your beliefs about the business should change as you get new information, and as a founder or cofounder you need to have the best picture in your head of which directions are most viable \u2014 even if that means abandoning a previous approach.",

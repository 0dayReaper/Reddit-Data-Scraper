Whether you are marketing your business or you are iterating on your product/service offering, keep showing up each day and push to improve 1% from the day before. It all adds up and compounds over time.\u00a0\n\n2.\u00a0When things feel like you're pushing a boulder up a hill all the time, I think it's fair to assume something fundamental needs to be changed.\n\n3.\u00a0If you want a chat feature on your product. Don\u2019t build it. Just pay for a service that lets you add that feature to your product.\u00a0This is especially good advice when you are still trying to get product-market fit.\n\n4.\u00a0Fall in love with the problem, not the solution.\n\n5.\u00a0Just launch. So simple, so true.\u00a0And relaunch often by reiterating base on customer feedback.\n\n6.\u00a0Delegate.\u00a0When businesses grow and mature, you can't handle everything, and more importantly: you can't do it *as well* as an expert. Then think of all the tasks you really don't like doing or aren't the best at, and start hiring to meet those needs.\n\n7.\u00a0Learn to enjoy the process, not the outcome.\n\n8.\u00a0Delayed gratification vs instant gratification. It is quite easy to do things for there's an instant reward/impact, but to do anything worthwhile, it will require focus and belief in delayed gratification (ex. icecream vs exercise).\u00a0And things compounds - both bad and good.\n\n9. We always tend to overestimate what we can do in a day or a week, but combined with delayed gratification, the power of compounding can be really used to gain big wins.\n\n10.\u00a0Do the right thing always when you have to choose between right &amp; easy.",

A good list nonetheless. \n\nHere\u2019s something that might be underrated: if you don\u2019t have a startup but want one really badly, especially if you\u2019re not sure what to do, stop reading about startups and startup advice. \n\nChances are you\u2019re reading about problems that you\u2019re not facing at the moment. The startup founders are the 1% of 1% of 1%. So unless you\u2019re a startup founder you probably don\u2019t have any employees to delegate to, any shares to issue, none of those challenges you face right now. Go out and tinker with the world and hone your interests, learn a specific domain, be strategic with yourself, your time, and others. Then spend at least five to ten years doing that. It takes time and skill to develop something unique enough to be profitable. \n\nJust my thoughts on what might be truly \u201cunderrated\u201d right now",

Being the cheap fuck that I am, I decided to restore the project, get it into working order in a private fork. Took a couple of days.\n\nWhat I didn't predict was the amount of engineering overhead this feature would cause me -- eventually I would spend weeks debugging simple things that failed miserably at scale.\n\nThe truth is, I swallowed my pride and ended up going for getstream, a hosted alternative. Why? Because I am not in the business of building activity feeds - I am in the business of nurturing a community.\n\n**Focus on what matters most. Allocate resources accordingly, so your main activity is what matters most to your venture.** And don't be a cheap fuck - spending a little bit monthly might save you thousands of hours of development time, which is money in the bank for you if you focus in the right things.",

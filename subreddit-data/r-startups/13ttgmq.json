I don't know how you funded, what the agreements were in place etc, but I do know that assuming things (what has he been doing for the last month) will only lead to conflict. Ask him!\n\nNow the real question is - Is the product ready to sell. Then also looking at the future when a large proportion of your work is done and you enter a period where you are managing the road map, not physically spending all day coding, do you think the balance of work may flip?\n\nNo one could give you solid actionable advice with so little context, so the ONLY bit of advice is to talk to your partners and ask them the questions you are posing to yourself. \n\nGood luck",

Some sales cycles can last months (1+ years for enterprise) and involve quite a few stages. No context on this \u201csales\u201d persons background either. Is this a sales leader with industry experience and a boatload of connections, a more junior sales person attempting to level up, or alternatively, someone perhaps on the biz side who is picking up sales until they are ready for a sales function? Also, is this person the CEO??? With the equity skew sure seems like it. Anyways\u2026just piling on prior post here\u2026more context would help :)",

Again, a hard no. Tell them you don't want to spend money on a lawyer but that is your next step.\n\n* Let them stew. \n\n* Ignore their offers which bump you to 25% or whatever.

If they want to see this product through to a viable company then things are going to change.\n\n* Then enjoy whatever you are doing next as it sound like their egos would rather have them keep 80% of nothing than 49% of something.",

I'm good with that.  I probably, wouldn't hire you even if you were available.  When I need customer account support, I'll hire them.

You can even hire separately a sales person and see how he will perform.\n\nBut... If the cofounder, who responsible for sales has a lack of communication skills , this is a serious red flag!",

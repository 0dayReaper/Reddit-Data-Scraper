    "postText": "Hello fellows, some serious advice is needed. Please, only people who actually have practical experience, not a theory.\n\nWe are in the early stage of building. Already conducted market research and responses are positive however it is challenging to understand if people will actually pay for the product. \n\nWe are building MVP at the moment but if we want to include all the payment system, registration, billing and etc. that would require at least one additional month. We want to launch quickly and see customer feedback. \n\nCan someone recommend, what are the ways to test if users are going to pay without making a full system?\n\nOr can someone recommend the fastest way to set up payments, registration and etc? \n\nP.S. I am not a software developer so something that requires minimal coding, please. \n\nThank you a lot!",

When they do have a page that says \"Thank you for your support! Our payment processor isn't fully ready yet but give us your email and we will contact you when we are ready\".\n\nBoom, you have data AND you can reach out to the people who were interested once you are ready to accept payments.\n\nI would /not/ have some weird cashapp link or something, personally.",

Let's say your selling...widgetals. Those will...aggregate someone's life into a control panel. You could run a series of ads, spend a couple bucks on each while shaping the messaging ($25 to start until you have the messaging down), and each ad leads to a newsletter signup along with which messaging was effective. \"Need to get a handle on all your messages before you finish your first cup of coffee? We're launching soon, sign up for early bird specials: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \" Now when you launch you also have a list of prospective customers. \n\nAnother option, sign up for Shopify. You can get a site and payment system set up in an hour. When you're ready to move off of it, just switch the link to your new payment page. May even find that \"outsourcing\" payment collection through them is worth it to not build it yourself - payments are notoriously tricky things to get right, and errors thrown on a payment page will permanently lose customers. Entrust it to companies whose sole purpose is to get that right for a variety of payment options.",

Don't try to sink $1k into marketing without knowing your $5 ads are successful or not.\n\nAs for Shopify, it's ultimately going to be cheaper while you're starting off. Your payment development is going to take time away from your MVP. Make the best possible product, get it out there, let the pros take care of what they're great with (payment processing), then move over when your revenue can support the development and technical debt involved.",

Setting all this up should take less than a day and doesn't require code.

There are out-of-the-box solutions for registration and payments you can leverage, there will be some coding to connect it all together but a competent dev should be able to have the basics up and running in a couple of weeks tops. You could kick the can on the payment system for X-days with a mock payment page that also offers an X-day free trial, but you would still need some sort of registration system to track users/collect emails to make the experiment much more valuable and see actually convert the users to real paying customers after the trial expires. Just ensure you can have the payments set-up by the time the first trial users come up for expiration. Typically you'll see must companies collect CC info at the start of the trial, but in this case, you would kick the can on that at first as well.",

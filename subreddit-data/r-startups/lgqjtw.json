    "postText": "Bryan Cranston was the lead actor in my favorite TV Show of all time: Breaking Bad. This story is not about him. It\u2019s about Rob.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Prologue\n\nWhile on my journey to build a $1B company (spoiler: I failed), I was lucky enough to travel the world demoing our video recognition technology.\n\nIn January 2017 I landed in Seattle. It was a cold snowy day. I was visiting one of the most exciting headquarters of the technology world: Amazon. More specifically I was meeting IMDb\u2019s Head of Business Development and Product team for a possible integration of our technology in their mobile App.\n\nFor context, Amazon holds in its HQ several subsidiaries including IMDb (acquired in 1998) and Amazon Studios.\n\nI arrived at the building 10 minutes earlier and was invited to go up to the 10th floor. After registered my entrance at the lobby, I sat on the first couch I saw. I wanted to double-check the demo to make sure everything was working as expected. I was heads down on my computer and phone when I realized someone just sat in front of me.\n\nAfter glancing at the couch in front of me I immediately went back to my computer. Not for long; I just realized I knew the person sitting on the other side of the lobby\u2026\n\nIt was Bryan Cranston.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Conversation\n\n\u201cBryan!\u201d Was the word that came out of my mouth against my will. I almost yelled his name at him\u2026 What a poor start of any conversation. I was shocked to have one of my favorite actors in the whole world sitting in front of me. He looked at me surprised: \u201cYes man, what\u2019s up?\u201d. I quickly stumble on my next words saying that I loved his work and apologized for screaming his name awkwardly.\n\nAfter this initial weird interaction, he was kind and curious enough to ask me what I was doing with my phone\u2026 I answered I was scanning movies to test the demo I was doing to IMDb.\n\nAnd one of the most interesting conversations started to take place in Amazon\u2019s HQ lobby. I started demoing the technology to Bryan; he even tried it himself. It was surreal.\n\nInteresting topics we talked about:\n\n* We were both there to \u201csell\u201d our thing. Bryan was discussing \u201cSneaky Pete\u201d extension and was humble enough to compare himself to me (in the sense that we were both there to make business with Amazon)\n* Potential technology benefits for Hollywood\n* That his job is to tell stories\u2026\n\nAt the time, I didn\u2019t understand how his job is to tell stories, he is an actor and producer. I wanted to learn more. It went something like:\n\n&gt;Me: What do you mean by that?  \nBryan: If you analyze the world, you will find that you have been told stories since you were born. You need stories to make sense of the world.  \nMe: Hm, never thought it in that way.  \nBryan: And the most important thing: people pay billions of dollars to hear a story.\n\nI was absolutely shocked by the simplicity and accuracy of this statement. I knew this empirically but never thought about it for business or marketing.\n\nPeople pay billions of dollars to hear a story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Enter Rob\n\nIn 2009 a journalist named Rob Walker (alongside with writer Joshua Glenn) wanted to find out if storytelling was powerful enough to make people spend more money on ordinary / low-value objects. He named this project: Significant Objects.\n\nHis strategy was brilliant: have creative writers invent stories about the objects and then post them on eBay and understand if the invented stories increase the value of the object measured by the eBay auction.\n\nHe bought 200 objects with an average of $1 each. The objects couldn\u2019t be clothing or anything that could be considered artwork. The results were mind-blowing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Results\n\nSome of my favorite results:\n\n* Indian Maden: bought at $0.99 | sold at $157.50 |15,800% valuation \u2705\n* Plastic Banana: bought at $0.25 | sold at $76 |30,300% valuation \u2705\n* Tile #4: bought at $1 | sold at $88 |8,700% valuation \u2705\n* Russian Figure: bought at $3 | sold at $193.50 |6,350% valuation \u2705\n* Mug: bought at $0.39 | sold at $31 |7,848% valuation \u2705\n* Button: bought at $0.50 | sold at $36.88 |7,276% valuation \u2705\n\nOne of the most impressive facts about the Mug object\u200a\u2014\u200aa massed produced mug\u200a\u2014\u200athat proofs the whole concept, was that people could buy the exact same mug on eBay for a fraction of the price but decided to licit the one with the story.\n\n*Take some time to read some of the stories (e.g. the banana is in comics format). They are brilliant!*\n\nThis whole project\u2019s conclusion is exactly what Bryan was referring to\u2026 People pay billions of dollars to hear a story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Lessons Learned\n\nEveryone knows storytelling is powerful but few people think of it as a revenue propeller for their businesses.\n\nStorytelling is the best marketing you can ever have. Rob\u2019s project shows us that if you tell a story about literally anything (e.g. irrelevant day to day objects) you can increase its value orders of magnitude.\n\nThat\u2019s how our mind works. It needs a story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS\u200a\u2014\u200aif you came thus far you are the living proof storytelling is a magnet. Go use it for your products/projects!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Hope you enjoyed this story about storytelling\u00a0:) Let me know if you have any questions.***",

Stories can capture attention, evoke emotion, and entrance listeners in a manner that reduces resistance to a message. Given the powerful persuasive potential of stories, one might deduce that it is best to embed one\u2019s facts within a story. In contrast to this perspective, the present research suggests that coupling facts with stories can either enhance or undermine persuasion. Specifically, to understand when facts benefit from the use of stories, this work provides a deeper examination of how counterargument reduction\u2014a common explanation for the unique persuasive capabilities of stories\u2014operates. Across three experiments, evidence is found for when it is more effective to embed facts within a story versus to use facts alone.",

I am a disabled woman veteran who makes paper hot air balloons. I have only become more serious about creating a business around my art because of the major encouragement I have received from those around me. But making these creations is meditative, magical and brings me hope. I will need to figure a way to tell this story without coming across as manipulative.",

I think marketing and PR verticals in the business have an old school view of what this means and think it is about the amount of times the company brand is mentioned somewhere or a traditional media outlet covers it or the reach on social. You can create content (written, digital, audio, video) based on your customers, stakeholders, executives, clients, people you want to do business with or around areas you want to be seen as a leader in - in an editorial way that isn't promotional. I think this is content that has true value in growing both revenue and brand awareness.",

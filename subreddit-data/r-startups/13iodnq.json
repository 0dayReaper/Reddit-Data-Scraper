Sales is mostly founder-led. \n\nWe are sponsoring a few conferences that directly serve our ICP, so it\u2019s a great chance to meet prospects.\n\nWhile I\u2019m a very personable person, not awkward etc., I\u2019m feeling kind of exhausted at the prospect of initiating so many conversations. I have been great in our discovery calls and demos because I\u2019m really good in 1:1, consultative selling mode. But I need some help getting like, PUMPED UP and in that \u201clet\u2019s be extroverted for a few hours meeting a ton of random people\u201d mode. I\u2019m just feeling pre-exhausted! \n\nI would love some help with the mental energy aspect of it and how to get and stay in the zone.",

Rather than having my own agenda, it's directed towards what others want or are experiencing. It takes a lot less energy, because it's about getting them to talk about themselves. And it makes them like you more (magical). The simplest icebreaker is \"So what's something you're taking away at this conference?\"\n\nYou don't have to be in sell mode because it's unlikely you're signing contracts there. Just take the time to build rapport and engagement with the brand. Let your sales guys do the selling. Be the recon.",

That might be to gamify it. Try to think of the event as a game where you need to have 10 interesting talks with your ICP. \n\nMake the game fun. Reward yourself. Compete with someone else who wants to join. Make it fun instead of dreadful.",

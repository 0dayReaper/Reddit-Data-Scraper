    "postText": "Hey everyone! \ud83d\udc4b  \nI'm about to embark on an exciting journey of launching my own startup, and I need your input on a crucial decision: should I start with building a website or dive straight into developing an app? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this!  \nHere's the thing, folks. Starting a startup is no walk in the park. It's a rollercoaster ride full of challenges and opportunities. One of the biggest dilemmas I'm facing right now is figuring out the best order to develop my online presence. So, website first or app first? Let's break it down!  \nOption 1: Website First \ud83c\udf10  \nOne argument in favor of starting with a website is that it's often a more cost-effective and faster route. Websites are generally easier to develop, requiring less specialized expertise and a shorter development cycle. With a website, I can establish an online presence relatively quickly, which means I can start engaging with potential customers sooner rather than later. But  my target Audience are facebook moms so i am afraid that they will need an app first not a website? I need your take about this guys   \nOption 2: App First \ud83d\udcf1  \nOn the other hand, some folks argue that diving straight into app development could offer unique advantages. We live in an increasingly mobile-centric world, where apps dominate the digital landscape. By prioritizing app development, I can tap into the growing mobile market and potentially reach a larger user base. Apps also provide a more immersive and personalized user experience, which could give my startup an edge in a competitive market.  \nPlease feel free to share your thoughts, advice, and stories in the comments below. Your input will help me make an informed decision and set my startup on the path to success.\n\nThank you all in advance for your valuable input and support. I'm excited to hear your perspectives and take this exciting step forward together!",

If it's something that doesn't require much native mobile functionality and could theoretically work as a (responsive) WebApp or maybe PWA, definitely go for Website first.\n\nYou can validate faster und put your MVP out there cross-platform.",

Well, launching a beta or MVP ASAP is crucial to gather user feedback and iterate on our product.\nNow, if most of your users are mobile-savvy, don't worry! You can still make your website mobile-friendly. It's all about optimizing the layout and functionality to ensure a smooth experience across different devices. After all, we want users to have a seamless and enjoyable time interacting with our product, no matter where they are!\nSo, embrace the power of a fast website launch, gather that valuable user feedback, and create a product that users will love.

Considering your audience is Facebook moms who may be more comfortable with apps, and the comments so far, here's a thought:  \nBegin with a mobile-friendly, responsive website. It's faster and cheaper to develop, which means you can validate your idea quickly. Plus, a well-designed site can offer a near app-like experience.   \nOnce you have user feedback and a solid customer base, invest in an app. It will provide a more immersive experience and should drive engagement further, especially since your audience is likely to appreciate an app.  \nRemember, there's no one-size-fits-all answer, it really depends on the specifics of your product and audience.

I've always been under the impression that if your application is purely informational(i.e. not a camera app or something that needs native access to device features) then a mobile app is mostly overkill. At least in terms of ui. The \"installation\" process is definitely sub par though. I'm sure device companies do that on purpose.",

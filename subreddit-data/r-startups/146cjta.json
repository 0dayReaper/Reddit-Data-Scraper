    "postText": "Hey guys, love this community and hoping you all can help me identify the BEST solution here...\n\nI've just begun building a SaaS MVP in insurance.  However, from day one, I'm taking on clients and servicing them in a more manual and consultative fashion.  Eventually we'll switch them over to the endgame SaaS product.\n\nThe consultative servicing involves me compiling a set of reports each month and providing to each client.  Of course, I can email/file-share each month, but I'd much prefer to stand up a \"customer portal\" for each client, with a folder for each month that contains the reports.  Better security, file history, user management, etc.\n\nA perfect solution would look like...\n\n* Custom branded file \"portal\" for each client\n* **Unlimited** sharing with external users (fine with me if it requires users to setup a login)\n* An established company - these files contain PII and SSNs, I need to go with something proven and solid\n* Unidirectional - I can upload docs, but users are unable to upload their own docs in my direction\n\nHere's what I've found so far, but none seem to be perfect:\n\n* [https://www.sync.com/client-file-portal/](https://www.sync.com/client-file-portal/)\n* [https://www.sharefile.com/client-portal](https://www.sharefile.com/client-portal)\n* [https://www.docsend.com/secure-client-portals/](https://www.docsend.com/secure-client-portals/)\n* [https://www.onehub.com/](https://www.onehub.com/) \\- this one is SO CLOSE, but it just lacks polish\n\nI'm hoping that someone has accomplished something similar and can share their thoughts, thanks all!",

            "comment": "It's obviously branded, but I personally love partners who use Google Drive because my company uses Google Drive (and the whole suite) so it makes integration super easy. If I want a file in my system I just transfer it over, I set permissions within my own ecosystem that's already set up.\n\nIf you really wanted it to be unbranded you could fairly quickly build a front-end that wraps around the Google Drive system using API calls.\n\nEdit: This isn't what you are looking for because I think it's a video piracy tool but the concept is very similar to what I was suggesting https://github.com/tks18/gindex-v4\n\nHowever, I will reiterate that I think most clients would be fine having a link to their own dedicated Google Drive. Especially if this is more of the beta/alpha of your startup and you plan to move this functionality into your own site eventually.",

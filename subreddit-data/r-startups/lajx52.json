    "postText": "I gotta get this off my chest, and I'm sure I'll piss some people off in the process.  Stop putting engineers in charge of startup product planning.  Would you put a carpenter in charge of planning your house? Of course not, that's what design architects are for.\n\nPart of the problem is engineers and investors think a like, they think more features equals more profit.  This simply is not true.  The best startups have great experiences with simple features.  In fact, studies have shown design led companies have 56% higher revenue on average.\n\nYou need divergent creative thinkers at the helm of product planning, not engineers.  Without great experiences, your functionality isn't worth a damn.\n\nThanks for attending my ted talk.\n\n\nEdit 1: There is a difference between leading, and having a seat at the table.  Of course Engineers and finance should be at the table.\n\nEdit 2: Design matters.  I'm not going to even try to argue that.  We settled that debate over a decade ago.  Users when given the choice between a good looking product and a bad one, 9/10 will choose the good experience.",

(Especially by job role) A balance is needed for sure, but recently there's been a push for beautiful designs that work great as mockups on screens which have horrible functionality in a real life setting. In a perfect world you would have a UX designer (User-journeys, mapping, empathy, research, usertesting...etc) and UI designer (Interface iconography, colours, graphics, typography...etc). A good way to describe this UX is the skeleton and UI the beautiful skin on top \ud83d\ude00",

I\u2019m a software engineer who recently started a company with 2 others, and I am CONSTANTLY reaching out to graphic designers I know on feedback. OP may be correct in the sense that not all engineers are the best designers, however, I think most who are, whether it\u2019s with software or anything else, are most definitely problem solvers. Again I\u2019m speaking from a software perspective, but I think that engineers can be a huge asset for planning software at the very least. I constantly am trying to figure out how to present information in as little clicks as possible. The simpler, yet more detailed the better. Always trying to look at it as if I\u2019m the consumer using the product. In my opinion the hardest part for me is being a perfectionist. I definitely am trying to make everything as perfect as possible. Whether it\u2019s UI, or code efficiency I\u2019ll sit on a problem until I know it\u2019s great. Luckily I\u2019m able to evaluate my own behaviors and tell myself that sometimes deadlines are more important than perfectionism. All just my opinion of course",

I am hardly a newbie.\n\nI have never worked with an engineer who did not act or speak condescendingly to the design team while simultaneously believing they're also designers.\n\nI have also never worked alongside an engineer (or worse, a person who went to school for engineering but chose a different career path, those are the most insufferable of them all) who did not treat the creative team like dogshit or insinuated that what they did was \"easy\" and simple only to churn garbage design work when they got their hands on the project. I appreciate that they think so highly of themselves, but no, you're not going to pick up a discipline that took a person a whole lifetime to achieve in 2 weeks just because you think you're smarter than them on account of you running numbers while they manage colors and shapes. \n\nIn fact, I'll say it's actually more plausible for a designer to pick up on engineering than it would be the other way around.",

I see designers as \"applied artists\", working top-down, outside-in. Engineers are having to manage the constraints and realities. So if one lets designers rule, one may end up with Chrysler (cool looking, but often shitty reliability and serviceability). If one lets engineers rule, one is more likely to get a Toyota or a Subaru (bland and slovenly, but reliable and serviceable).\n\nAn amalgamation of both disciplines might be the role of a traditional architect, especially one who is allowed the luxury to develop the product to low-level details. E.g. if you're in USA, Frank Lloyd Wright's falling water is a good example of the design permeating the creation from the overall concept, masing and style down to furnishings and even door hardware and plumbing fixtures.\n\nFor these reasons I smirk when I see techies and designers pointing fingers at each other. It takes two to tango.",

But there's a flip side to that too: is the owner's job actually to give the users what they *need*?\n\nNo, not exactly. Management's primary job is to provide customers with what those customers will pay for. Often users will pay for what they need, but it's not that simple. If a user \"needs\" A but they *want* B, then you may not build a viable business by selling them A. Not at first, at least. But you well may build a viable business by selling them B, and having that foothold can allow you to move them over to A.\n\nCustomers -- and especially corporate customers -- pay *big money* for specific features. For larger businesses, their buying process is most often based on comparing the different features that different vendors provide. If you don't have the features that they've decided they need, then your competitor gets the business and your well-designed product withers and dies.\n\nAnd even if that's not the case... while I am familiar with the elevator/mirror adage and recognize its value: the engineer that installs a $1.5M elevator has likely ensured that the business can continue to pay his salary and that of his colleagues, whereas the designer who installs a $50 mirror might maybe have earned a few hours of consulting fees.\n\ntl;dr: The world works on incentives.

If you let engineers decide all on their own, they'll choose the thing that is easiest to develop and maintain, and if you let the designers choose they'll often come up with something that is user-friendly but a pain to develop and maintain. Have them sit down and work it out together, and they can find those serendipitous solutions, where 20% of the effort gets you 80% of the benefit, letting you get way more \"UX for your buck\". Saying things like \"what are we trying to achieve with this page?\" and \"could this \\[way easier to implement\\] component maybe do the same job?\" is an indication that you're doing it right. And having both parties involved from an early stage to make those adjustments means it's way faster and easier to change a design to something implementable, rather than later when other choices may depend on it.\n\n\"Keep your friends close, but your designers even closer\" is a favorite saying of mine (coming from an engineering background).",

For those of us design alums, familiar with the design-thinking methodology, know it\u2019s nothing new. It\u2019s an ancient practice but cleverly and rightfully coined, framed, and democratized by IDEO in the 90s. I\u2019m essentially advocating design-led company model in a similar journey to redefine and make explicit to enable a new generation of entrepreneurial designers and artists\u2026love to hear your thoughts?",

    "postText": "If I (as an individual) receive VC to start a business, is that considered income, and do I owe taxes on it? Does anyone have any links to resources or information about this? All I was able to find was info about taxes owed by investors.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have any money, and can't afford to consult with tax experts. I also can't afford fees to register a business and get a tax ID, and I certainly don't have the funds to open a bank account in the name of the business. I also don't have the money for a trademark search or to register the trademark for the business name, or anything else I'd need to do when starting a business. Right now I'd need to be able to receive VC myself and then use that money to start the business, and I need to know what kind of taxes I'd own on that investment money.",

They do not give you money to create an entity first. This is both for practical (legal and accounting) reasons, but it is also a way of gatekeeping their time:\n\nIf you can\u2019t generate enough money to incorporate a company, why would an investor trust you to take their money and turn it into more money.\n\nThe more steps you are able to successfully take the more investor interest there will be. If you can\u2019t take the first step on your own, you should expect investor interest to be pretty close to zero.",

You only need $1k for retainment and then other $4k when all the paperwork is in order. Admittedly I'm using them because a friend of mine works for them, so it was convenient. In other words, $1k gets you all the legal answers specific to your needs for quite a long time.\n\nAs for paying it, I'm taking a small personal loan to cover the $4k. I probably could cover it myself, but then I'd have to tap into our safety net savings... Not a risk I want to take given the job market!",

I.e. if you don't know what you want, you should figure that out first because there is no easy \"undo\" button when it comes to legal paperwork. But I completely agree that a good startup attorney is the best resource to help you figure out what you want if that's a question.  \n\n\nThe key words there are \"good startup attorney\".  One of the reasons we started Clerky is because we had clients who started off with the wrong kind of lawyer for the type of business they were building, and we kept having to fix everything (which as you point out, costs a lot more than doing it right in the first place).  We started Clerky to help founders avoid that mess.  \n\n\nAnyways, what you can do is use Clerky with your attorney \u2014\u00a0so you just pay for the advice and review part, and have our software handle the rest.  But if you get 1 year of truly unlimited legal help, that's a great deal even if they are handling the paperwork more manually.  Usually people don't get that result from fee deferrals, but maybe your friend working there will help you get a better outcome.",

You just need money to pay all the hardware and software engineers to make that happen.\n\nDo you have any intellectual property - like a patent application - or other knowledge or asset to ward off competition? You should know that this is a fairly common desire and moneyed companies like Amazon are already way ahead of you. \n\nDo not be discouraged. Your next breakthrough business idea may come to you at 3am tomorrow morning!",

Because the fact is VCs do not just give individuals money.  They BUY a peice of the existing COMPANY in thr form of stocks.  \n\nIf say, someone just happened to give you $10,000 to get off the ground....you would essentially be being gifted that money and yes...taxes.  \n\nBetter to get some si3m0le paperwork drawn up and go from there.",

When you return that investment to your investors at a surplus to what they invested then they need to pay tax. If you took their investment and paid it to yourself as dividends then you would also need to pay tax. If you spend it on business activities then you're fine. If you use it to pay yourself a salary then you do need to pay income tax.",

They buy part of your company (and own a share of your profits in perpetuity) in exchange for giving you the capital you need to grow.\n\nWhat makes them VCs is their approach to investing.  They tend to favor high risk / high reward businesses in new/growing fields.\n\nOutside of business described this way, you'd probably need regular investors.\n\nVCs can be a good deal or a bad deal, so you really need to understand what you're selling, and what you're getting in return.\n\n*P.S. If you're in tech, you need to ask yourself why someone would start a successful tech company only to become a VC.  If they know how to start a successful tech company, why wouldn't they just do that again?!?  Seeking the answer to this question will lead you to business-wisdom.*",

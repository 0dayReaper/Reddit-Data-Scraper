    "postText": "I have a platform which is 100% done, launched a few months ago, running ads and iterating. But I'm alone and have no funding. As I'm technical I'm looking for someone non technical who can sell, market, raise funds, etc, and interested in my industry (social media / adult entertainment).\n\nI tried on YC founder matching but it seems to me that most people there already have an idea in mind so it's hard to onboard them on your idea.\n\nAnd a few more questions:\n\n\\- How much should the non-tech founder invest in capital, assuming the platform has been completed and the whole coding part is taken care of? Let's be honest, it's not easy to find such occasions for non-technical people ('hey do you want to get 50%  equity, the platform is already done\"). Which brings me to my next point.\n\n\\- How much equity is common to give? How do you determine that?\n\n\\- What are some red flags to look out for?\n\n\\- How do you not get fuc\\*ed over? (contracts I assume?).\n\nThe company is registered in Europe btw so I'm not sure how similar it is to the US.",

            "comment": "You're definitely looking for an investor and not a co-founder. And, to answer your other question, yes there are plenty of founders who raise capital as a solo founder.\n\nThat being said, the number one thing that people look in a founding team beyond technical experience is \"Is this technical founder the best possible person to SELL this product\". Most technical founder startups fail because the founder, in this case you, thinks that good product = guaranteed sales. \n\nYou would bring on a co-founder who knows how to sell and/or grow the business. And, if found someone good, it would not be unheard of to offer them not only \"cofounder\" status but also in the neighborhood of 15-35% equity depending on their experience that vests over a standard 4 year period.\n\nI cannot overemphasize the reality of how hard it is to sell something. And, if you think that your platform will be easy to sell, pls know that it is you I'm trying to reach with the reality that it is very, very hard to sell.",

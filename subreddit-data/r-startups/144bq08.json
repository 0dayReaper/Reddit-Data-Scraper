    "postText": "Whenever I start on a difficult project, I often run into hard roadblocks that I could get advice for if  I had an experienced person in the field that I could meet with. I frequently find myself thinking, \"if only I could pay someone experienced to give me a rundown of how this works and what I need to do to fix it, I would be so much better off.\"\n\nI've thought of creating a platform that allows people who have side-businesses and hustles to meet with others in their same field for specific advice or solutions. I'm not talking novice to expert where it's like a mentoring program, but where it's a brief meeting between you and someone more knowledgable within your specific field.\n\n**Have any of you had similar thoughts? And would this be something you would use?**\n\nThis could potentially double as a networking platform to meet higher-up people in your field for a steeper meeting price, etc.\n\n**All feedback and criticism is welcomed!**",

Speaking for myself, no, I don't see myself moving to a new platform any time soon.\n\nThat said, speaking as one of the moderators of r/robotics, the more challenging ***problem seems to be getting qualified experts to look at who needs help***. It's the same old story: You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. Providing the platform isn't enough -- Users need some kind of *incentive* to engage each other beyond general affinity.\n\nI honestly don't know what that solution may be. Off the cuff, I'd say something Fivrr-like. But my immediate response to myself is, \"Well then why not just use Fivrr for my needs? Why not just use Fivrr to incentivize me to offer brief consultation services?\" There are even more questions you can ask.\n\nNot that this solves your problem, but I'm currently reading \"The Mom Test\" to help me get better at identifying customer needs &amp; motivations. I'm open to having a reading-buddy if you want to DM me.",

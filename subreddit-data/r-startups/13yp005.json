Everything starts running.\n\nI would love to have my own start up and I wish to integrate my skills and knowledge as a PM together with my previous career in Early Childhood. There are loads of problem statements in EC field. But I'm stuck on which to choose.\n\nSo, I'm just wondering, what happen that makes you feel confident that this is THE product that would work?",

If you have many ideas to pick from then pick the one you feel most excited about first.

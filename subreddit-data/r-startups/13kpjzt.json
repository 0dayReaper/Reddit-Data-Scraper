Many people choose the comfort of the problem space and avoid taking risks. If you have a dream, that is great. Now stop staying in the problem space and go out into the solution space.\n\nIf your dream is to start a business, I encourage you to pursue it, but it's important to handle the risks in a manageable way. Failure is inevitable when taking risks, but it's a natural part of life for everyone. Start with what you have and work with your current resources. If you know your resilience might not be high, consider starting with something that won't bring you too low.\n\nIn my opinion, joining another start-up to learn and seeking out resources like books or podcasts on leadership for people that struggle. Understanding your own identity, what makes you unique, and embracing your strengths is essential. By doing so, you can develop an authentic leadership style that suits you. In my opinion, anyone can become a leader if they find a genuine way to enhance their personal leadership skills.",

But there is literally no way to be \"good enough\" without starting, making mistakes and learning from them. \n\nYou could have a PhD in your chosen field and still not be \"good enough\" without the experience.\n\nI don't know where you're at in your career but jumping straight into running your own business without holding a relatively senior position elsewhere and making mistakes at someone else's expense is an almost guaranteed way to fail. \n\nYou mention burning out easily. I'd highly recommend finding out what it is that makes this happen and find ways to manage it. The start up life is not easy and in most situations it will be more taxing than a regular job. \n\nAs for depression / BPD / anxiety.. only you can decide whether you have them sufficiently under control for it not to impact your performance. \n\nAs other commenters have mentioned, assess why you want to go the start up route. What is it that you're attracted to? Because if you think it's cool offices, easy funding and wealth .. you're wrong. That's a small strata of hyper successful businesses which most start ups do not reach.",

It does however require energy, discipline, desire and a healthy grounding in reality. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t say don\u2019t do it - but before you do: ask yourself if this is a good time in your life to take on something that will take more energy than a regular job often takes. If your energy is depleted and your credit cards are maxed out it\u2019s probably not a great time to start a business. Right now you should focus on getting yourself well so that the day you do start a business you\u2019re not setting yourself up to fail.",

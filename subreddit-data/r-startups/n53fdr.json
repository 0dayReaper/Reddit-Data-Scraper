    "postText": "*(Appreciate all the love but please ask my permission before re-posting/cross-posting. Thank you!)*\n\nWhy is it that some startups do exceptionally well while many struggle? There\u2019s a host of reasons ranging from leadership to product-market fit to environmental shifts. From where I stand though, I\u2019m particularly interested in the impact of early marketing decisions. I\u2019ve made my fair share of mistakes but I\u2019ve also experimented with approaches that led to big wins. Here\u2019s my marketer\u2019s perspective on what works and doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\\- -  *For context, I've been around the innovation and tech startup space for longer than I care to think about. I've lead high-performance B2B marketing teams, and helped grow small startups, mid-size scaleups, and one big fat company.* \\- -\n\nOk, here we go...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** **Startup vs. scaleup marketing:**\n\nThis is a common scenario: You\u2019re in the early stages of setting up your company and you\u2019ve got a product and some customers. Naturally, you want to see more growth, fast. It sounds counterintuitive but please don\u2019t be so quick to turn to marketing to crank up the demand gen engine. Marketing may be the last thing you should invest in right now.\n\nIf you take a look at your churn numbers and NPS, what story does it tell you? Many startups get excited by total customer numbers but they neglect to understand what happens to customers once they\u2019ve signed up. Dig deep to identify the in-product activities that cause friction and those that create customer value.\n\nNow use that knowledge to adjust your customer onboarding (in-app or otherwise) so you can guide users to value as quickly as possible. This is where a good product marketer will be super helpful. They can also identify early fans that you can leverage to amplify your brand\u2019s reach. It\u2019s a bit of a manual process, but unless you get it right, you really don\u2019t have a solid foundation to scale from. You have a leaky bucket.\n\nI\u2019ve been there and trust me, it\u2019s a lousy place to be when you have to replenish your user base every year plus grow your revenue. First, walk. Then, run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2)** **Different phases call for different marketers:**\n\nWhen you\u2019re starting out, your budget is tight, and you\u2019re reaching into your network to find someone, anyone, with a doer attitude and a bit of digital marketing experience. Heck, your first marketing hire might even be straight out of school. And it\u2019s fine while you\u2019re still at the product-market fit stage. Just realize that someone else has to put on the strategic hat - and it\u2019s going to have to be you.\n\nNow here\u2019s where I\u2019ve often seen things go sideways. Once you\u2019ve established product-market fit, you turn to one of your first marketing hires and give them the mandate to build out your marketing team, and strategy. Chances are you even gave them a big title like Director or Head of Marketing when you hired them to compensate for their low-ish salary. Unfortunately, your early-career hustlers may not be equipped to lead growth at this stage.\n\nSo, before stacking the responsibilities on them, go through the exercise of figuring out what you actually need from marketing.\n\nSome things to think about:\n\n* What are your overall business goals? ARR, ARPU, total customer count, active user count, etc.\n* Does your product (price and complexity) justify a high-touch sales process or can you deliver it easily with zero touch (aka automated self-serve)?\n* Does your ideal customer heavily lean on word of mouth for their purchases or are you selling something more transactional?\n* Are you targeting a highly technical audience?\n* Are partnerships and/or integrations important to your business?\n* Are you creating a new product category where education and problem agitation is necessary to drive demand?\n\nMy point here is that you should create an \u201cideal head of marketing profile\u201d that\u2019s not skewed by the capabilities of your initial hires. You\u2019ll have more clarity when you go ahead and promote your existing employees or hire above them or below them. You\u2019ll know how much support you need to provide. And you\u2019ll be able to justify your decision to anyone who questions it.\n\nFinal word of advice on this. Save yourself the headache and don\u2019t give big titles to your first junior marketing hires. You can always upgrade them later but you can\u2019t downgrade them. Again. I've been there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)** **Marketing is a revenue-driving function:**\n\nNow here\u2019s something else to think about on the topic of marketing leadership. I\u2019m always surprised that there are still founders today who think of marketing\u2019s role as \u201cdoing social and managing the website.\u201d This is 2021, and if your intention is to grow, you need to shift your mindset and lean into marketing - not just sales - to drive revenue. Yes, even if the sale is always closed by a real human being. Both functions have to work in sync. Failure to recognize this means that you\u2019re not optimizing metrics like customer conversion rate, pipe velocity, or CAC (customer acquisition cost). You're basically running marketing like it's 2009. Sorry.\n\nSo, as you start scaling, look for a marketing lead who:\n\n* Has a business mindset.\n* Has a deep desire to connect with and understand your ideal customers.\n* Measures meaningful KPIs like active users and trial signups, not fixate on low-intent metrics like social followers and web visitors.\n* Is eager to partner up with your sales team if you\u2019ve got one.\n* Is eager to partner up with your customer success team.\n\nThat kind of talent sometimes comes with a hefty price tag, especially if they\u2019ve got experience. It may not be possible to bring them on board now. What is possible though, is to get yourself an advisor who is that person so they can guide your big marketing decisions - like strategy and hiring - and also coach your existing staff to up-level their skills.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4)** **Marketing can\u2019t be an echo chamber:**\n\nI hinted at this earlier but I want to expand on it. Anyone on your marketing team who creates content (website, articles, videos, ads, emails, etc.) needs to deeply understand your ideal customer profile. If they don\u2019t, your message won\u2019t land. And don\u2019t fall into the trap of thinking that you, your co-founders, or sales can just \u201ctell them what to write.\u201d Sure it\u2019ll be good enough at the start but it\u2019s not a strategy to build a business.\n\nSo, make \u201ccustomer interactions\u201d an integral part of your marketing teams\u2019 job from day one and give them the time to do it. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve seen work really well:\n\n* New marketing hires spend 3-5 days with your customer success team. Match them up with a buddy so they can listen in on calls, read chats, then graduate to answering simple questions themselves (if it\u2019s realistic for your business.) Repeat this every quarter for 1-2 days.\n* New marketing hires spend 3-5 days with your sales team. This is sometimes tricky to implement because sales peeps often want to protect customer relationships. The goal here is for marketers to be invisible and to listen. They shouldn\u2019t interfere with the call \\*at all\\* without discussing it with the sales rep ahead of time. Again, repeat every quarter.\n* And now the most important activity: Get your marketing team to talk directly with real customers! Sounds simple but it rarely happens consistently. Your marketing lead and anyone creating content needs to be on the phone/Zoom/whatever talking to the people they target. Weekly or at least monthly. The goal is not selling, it\u2019s listening. If anyone in your company is guarding customers (think customer success or sales), get in there and stop the nonsense. You want your business to grow? Then marketing needs facetime with customers.\n* Finally, make sure your marketing team spends plenty of time doing social listening. On your own social channels but also on different online communities where your audience hangs out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5) Beware the fake voice:**\n\nLet\u2019s imagine your product is a FinTech app you sell to Finance Directors, or a tool you sell to Developers. We\u2019re not talking about a mass-market product here but one that solves a problem for a specialized audience. Do this test: Can your marketing content creators speak credibly to your customers face-to-face? Even if they do all of the immersive work I mentioned above, could you, for example, put them on a podcast to intelligently discuss industry challenges with some of your customers?\n\nIf you target an industry or audience that\u2019s specialized in any way, carve out some time from your schedule or your co-founders\u2019 to be the face of your company (assuming you have subject matter expertise.) Or hire an SME/evangelist early on. No amount of prep and scripting behind the scenes will make your young marketing manager sound credible talking to a technical audience on video, on a podcast, or in person (unless they come from the right background.) In 2021, more than in recent years, customers want to feel a human connection with brands. Even in B2B. I know this type of SME is a unicorn - part technical, part educator, part marketer - but it\u2019s 100% worth it. It works. People buy from people and brands they trust, even in an era of zero touch sales.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is so much more I\u2019d like to discuss but for fear of boring you, I\u2019ll stop right here and title this post \u201cthe 5 things\u201d rather than \u201cthe 10\u201d.\n\nIf you\u2019re still reading, I hope I got some of your neurons firing in the right direction!",

You are a clear writer. :)\n\n\nRegarding product marketers, are they the ones figuring out the customer journey and \"personas\". Is that through direct discussions with customers, or can product usage data tell you that? I'm definitely curious about mapping those friction and value points for better onboarding. Should that be done by account or by persona?\n\nAlso, if you have a highly technical product that relies on partner relationships and integrations--how do you know what lead source &amp; conversion rates are \"good\" for each channel (e.g., Marketing, Alliances,  Sales, Customer Success)?\n\nAppreciate you!",

Wish I'd been able to read it 15 years ago, but instead I made the exact mistakes mentioned: selling to a very technical audience and not understanding how my non-tech marketing hires could be so ineffective. Some were very driven, smart and outgoing - great public speakers and they hired external people to help produce tech content. As it turned out, they were unable to gauge the quality of the content, unable to connect with the target audience and on top of it I failed to aim them at the few KPIs that mattered, which made them try to optimize everything at once.\n\nFor a technical audience, I think an evangelist employee is very very important. Early on it may be the founder(s), later on a hire, but someone in marketing has to actually be part of the target segment or marketing will fail.",

The product or service may be applicable to everybody in the world, but most startups do not have the budget to run Superbowl ads. \n\nNiching down into a specific niche that the company knows its product serves will go a long way in the early days of startups. This goes for really any company unless you're Coca-Cola, Amazon or Salesforce. When you get deep into the niche's a lot of the time there just aren't that many marketers competing for attention and you can get the word across quickly, cheaply, and directly to the right people.",

I talk to early career marketers often (not at my company) and 90% of them don't know how much revenue their company generates. They just don't have that mindset.

You can e.g. create a workshop, content product, learning material around your topic and collect feedback to improve your core tech product. Also, many important multipliers who can help with market entry are super open to speak with startups and give valuable feedback.\n\nHappy building!",

    "postText": "Hello.\n\nSo, I have a mobile app I'm working on (yada-yada on the details, but it's published and an older prototype has 400k downloads), and now we're trying to pitch to investors. We wrote to some 10 investors and about 4-5 potential clients, plus signed up on an angels network and posted our pitch there.  \n\n\nWe basically had zero interest. On the pitch platform we got ZERO contact (despite reaching out to some 20+ people there), except for a couple of guys that actually wanted to sell their documentation services, not invest. From the e-mails, we got a couple of \"no thanks\" and a single actual conversation, quite enjoyable and helpful, that ended with \"I'll pass because I don't know how much money this can make\".  \n\n\nWe are not new to failure and we excepted adversity, but what gets us down is the absence of (almost) any feedback. I'd really like to figure out what is the problem. At the moment, we have several hypothesis:  \n\n\n* The business is difficult to understand (it's a highly customizable companion app for other products, won't go into detail, but I agree it's not as straight forward as \"I want to open a restaurant\")\n* The business doesn't seem profitable enough (despite us comparing very closely to two businesses, one that was sold for $150M and one that makes $12M annually, and we highlighted what we bring on top of what these two do)\n* The business doesn't seem feasible? (it is fairly ambitious, but we have a working prototype and a lot of technical experience; personally this is the part I'm most comfortable about)\n*  We are from Romania (this hurts, because I can kind of understand it. We don't have a great reputation abroad. Many sites or investors we tried have a clear line of countries they invest in, and a lot of them don't have ours on the list; we only applied to the ones that did though. But even so, I guess this might disqualify us? One of the two \"no thanks\" replies clearly said \"we don't invest in Romania\" - would registering the business in a different country help with this, or could it just be about our own nationality?\n* The documentation isn't great: indeed we don't have much business experience, we are technical experts. And I've been told (by the people trying to sell documentation services, so I don't know if I believe it) our documentation isn't good enough and that's what might turn away investors. But since the source for this is a biased party, I don't know if I should believe it.\n* Others?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're really unsure what to do at this point. We expected a lot of rejection, but we expected a lot more \"no thanks\" - and a tiny tiny bit of feedback, but we got a lot of - nothing - instead. I'm not sure what we should improve, or if we should back down and focus on something else, or just continue work on the product and grow our audience before trying for investors again.  \n\n\nAny advice on how we should proceed?",

It could also be that you\u2019re going after the right investors.\n\nAs for credentials, I run an agency that helps startups for free and I used to work at an accelerator where I worked with thousands of founders that were trying to raise money.",

Then, if it\u2019s something that\u2019s hard to understand, really work on making it easy to understand what you are offering. If it\u2019s not clear how much many you\u2019ll make, check that out too. See if there are options for more income.\n\nThe documentation thing sounds like rubbish to me. The lack of enquiries or contact tells me you have other problems.\n\nHow much do you need an investor? If you\u2019ve got a prototype with 400k downloads, can you monetise that and bootstrap?\n\nThere are VCs and angels for whom your being based in Romania will be either irrelevant or even aligned with their goals. Keep searching! \n\nI\u2019d also try to make direct contact with VCs and investors and ask for advice. Don\u2019t go through a platform - do it directly. Ask for advice instead of pitching straight at them. And don\u2019t be surprised to not get much feedback - that\u2019s fairly normal.\n\nAnd if you are all technical folks, have you consider getting coaching to help with the human side of this? And you could even consider getting a cofounder in to help with that.",

And the code wasn't great, so we mostly dropped it as it was hard to maintain, in favour of the new one which is  ery fancy and has a good monetization plan. \nBut short answer, the old one can't carry the development for us, without considerable effort, which at this point is better invested in the new one.\n\nWe're not sure about finding a cofounder (we are 2 so far). I'm not against it, but I'm not convinced it is worth the effort. The business is a bit complicated and niche, and I'm not sure where we would start with finding one. So... Not against it, just a bit unsure of how it works out.",

You need to be telling a story about getting to 100m+ valuation in 5-10 years to be interesting. Really, that amount of investment, compared to the low annual income, is too high for the return for almost any investor.\n\nTo be honest, it sounds like a cofounder would really help you here. You might need to be open to annoying questions and be willing to make some difficult decisions so that you can get to a tool and business model that really makes financial sense. Once you\u2019ve made the decision to find a cofounder, finding  them is a different challenge.",

However, we don't know exactly how much we can grow. Our projection for the first million is based on our old app analytics, and assumes better monetization, growth and retention, but it is just an educated guess.  \n\n\nOn the other hand, the closest business to our business model makes 11.3M per year, so we think eventually that's what we will compare to - hopefully more of course, because we do several extra things and have a much smoother experience.   \n\n\nBut you are right, we could use a clearer business model, and maybe we should consider a co-founder.

Maybe start with a short query letter or engaging with VCs at events to try and build up some relationships? The other thing is to associate connections.

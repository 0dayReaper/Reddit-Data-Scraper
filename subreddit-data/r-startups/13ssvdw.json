    "postText": "Hi I am a CS major college student and currently I am doing coursework for Design for Real People subject which is basically finding problems that real people are struggling with and building a solution for that.\n\nMy group is investigating problems with job searching. We are gathering voices from both the applicants' side and companies side. \n\nWe want to hear what problems startup people confront when hiring people. We want to understand your perspective, experiences, and challenges. I would be happy if you can share your experiences. Also, I know you have probably been an applicant once so you are welcome to share what pain points you had as an applicant as well. \n\nI really want to do this project well and I don't want to make a mistake of making up a problem instead of finding an already existing problem. I'd greatly appreciate your support. Also, if there are better ways of finding a problem than doing interviews and surveys, please let me know. \n\nThe following are some questions that might help you think about your answers:  \n&lt;Hiring Manager&gt;  \n\\- \"Can you describe your company's hiring process? What ways (networking, linkedin, etc) do you usually use?   \n\\- So far, what's the most effective ways of hiring the right fit employees so far? Why?   \n\\- \"What challenges do you face during hiring process?\"  \n\\- \"How important of a role do you think job description plays during hiring process? What are difficulties of writing job descriptions?  \n\\- \"What feedback have you received from applicants about job descriptions? Is there a common theme?\"  \n\\- \"If you could change one aspect of the job posting or application process, what would it be and why?\"  \n&lt;Applicant&gt;  \n\\- \"Tell me about your job search process. What tools and platforms do you use?\"  \n\\- \"What challenges do you face while searching for a job?\"  \n\\- \"What are your thoughts when reading a job description?\"  \n\\- \"What do you wish you could know about a job before you apply?\"  \n\\- \"Have you ever taken a job and found the reality to be different from the job description?\"",

            "comment": "Startup hiring challenges depend on a number of variables \u2013 some are within the startup\u2019s control (eg. process, or lack thereof) some are not (eg. economic/market conditions). The stage the startup is at (pre-seed, seed, Series A etc) is also a big one. Generally, the earlier the stage, the more fundamental the hiring problem.  \nHiring challenges at early stage startups can generally be broken down as follows:  \na) Who:   \n\\- what type of personality and culture fit would work best with the founders and the rest of the team?  \n\\-  what thinking/working/relating competencies should they possess?  \nb) What:  \n\\- what roles do I need to hire for? do I have a good handle on the scope of the job? how many people? salaried employee or independent contractor? experienced or junior? salary/equity?  \n\\- you should hire generalists as you build, specialists as you scale  \nc) Where:  \n\\- co-located, remote, hybrid?  \nd) When:  \n\\- this is a big one. You can hire too early, hire on time, or hire too late. 90% of startups hire too late. Some founders mistakenly believe they can do the work themselves, or misjudge how much time it really takes to recruit &amp; hire the best people. Oftentimes the realization that they needed someone yesterday comes at the 11th hour \u2013 resulting in a flawed/rushed process that sees the wrong people getting hired. Rinse and repeat.  \n\\- one client of mine hired a CTO probably 4-6 months too early. The guy sat around doing junior level coding work but was being paid a CTO salary (and being resented by the rest of the team).   \ne) Why:  \n\\- this is also often overlooked. Every early hire should contribute to growth and moving more quickly. I had a founder client who once hired an admin assistant as an early hire. In his mind, this person would free up his calendar and create capacity in his day to work on important tasks, but what he really needed was another software engineer to refine his prototype. Money not well spent.  \nf) How:   \n\\- process before people. If you have strong hiring/HR/operational/communication processes you can rely on having less people (especially mid managers).   \n\\- a hiring process has to be a playbook \u2013 you\u2019ll be doing it multiple times. Too many early stage startups wing it and make it up as they go along. They either have no process (CEO/CTO gut hires on the spot after one Zoom call based on how likeable you are), the process is too long (too many interviews over too many days), too cumbersome (interviews + test/homework + audition), or the process itself doesn\u2019t accurately measure what really matters.  \nGrowth stage startups have a whole host of other hiring challenges.   \nHope this helps. This is a great topic, good luck with your coursework :)",

There was clear demand of learning what the \"jobs\" are actually about. \n\nOne hypothesis solution I came up with is a hackathon. I know internships are the best solutions but it's not available at the moment due to the macro economic factors. Then, why not just make hackathons that function as mock-internships?\n\nJust made a landing page by myself: [https://edunin.herokuapp.com/](https://edunin.herokuapp.com/)   \nYes, I am tracing the conversion rate and I'd be happy if you give feedback on this (both the idea and the landing page).\n\nMy team and I are going to build an MVP in the following 3 weeks.

    "postText": "About me, late 40s lawyer w mba from mid level regional schools. In Midwest. Was COO for 9 months at a startup that sold to a larger company whose ads you likely see on tv. I have a startup about to launch in the lawtech space. I\u2019m the only person yet and my focus is on sales and product development and an outside firm does the software dev work. \n\nWould love be to leave law practice behind. Would it make any sense for me to level up my mostly non existent tech skills, mostly for purposes of increasing the likelihood of funding but also so if things don\u2019t work out I could maybe land a non lawyer role is SAS sales or something? I may also be involved in the dev but unsure. \n\nBoot camp? MS in comp sci?\n\nI make a low 6 figures now and want to stay at that level or make more. Could go down to say 85k if I had to. \n\nDoes any of this sound logical? Goal is to scale the startup but wondering if vc money would come easier if I at least had an AWS cert or something. Thoughts? \n\nTIA",

            "comment": "Considering your background, I'd suggest focusing on networking and pitching to VCs rather than getting a certification or degree. Your law and business expertise will be valuable assets, and with the right connections, funding will follow. If you're looking to improve your tech skills, perhaps go for an online course or workshop to better understand the software dev side, but keep the main focus on growing your startup!",

I can't see how this is anything but a waste of time.  Hire engineering; they'll be way better at it than you, code school or no.\n\nIf you want to replace the external firm -- and you should -- likely the best bet is to hire yourself an experienced engineering manager.  They can evaluate the quality of work and build out a plan to transition it in house.",

            "comment": "If you just want to be a COMPETENT web developer - not a 100x, not a Rockstar - in the shortest time possible and for relatively zero dollars and at your pace, I would simply follow a guy named Brad Traversy on Youtube (TraversyMedia) and his Udemy courses. I made a solid (long) list of all the videos you'd want to watch and courses to buy (most are usually $9-15 US) in the order you should watch them if you want to Learn HTML, CSS, JS, PHP. THis guy is the mentor I wish I'd had when I started 13+ years ago. Anyone that really focuses on following his tutorials AND actually codes along with him for 3-6 months will be WAY ahead of where I was 5-6 years into my career.\n\nAgain will you be a M/FAANG level software engineer after watching all his videos and coding along to build out the mini projects he builds? Not even close. But will you be a competent web developer with a solid understanding of the technologies that help you build and run websites and some modern style web apps? Yes, yes you will.\n\nNot sure what your end goal is, but as another commenter said: maybe you are 10 years away from being an experiecned all-knowing software engineer, but you're really only several focused months away from knowing how to build competent, attractive, functional websites and web apps.",

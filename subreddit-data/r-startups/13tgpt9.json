    "postText": "I'm creating a startup, which is basically a design agency. I've been thinking about my marketing strategy and I'd like to work with ads, content marketing and affiliate marketing.\n\nI've done ads and content marketing before, but I'm new to affiliate marketing. My idea is to give affiliates a coupon that gives their clients a discount and a commission to them. I have the system set up on my website but I have no idea how to make it work, namely find people who might be interested, how to approach them, etc.\n\nAnyone has experience with this and could give me some tips? \n\nThank you in advance!",

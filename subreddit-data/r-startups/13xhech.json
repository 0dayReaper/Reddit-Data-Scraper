    "postText": "For the past 3 years I had a startup (b2b saas software) that had a good run, but is not growing fast enough. Among other things, a major issue was that we had a lot of problems getting customers to embrace what we do. We are an innovative product, so figuring out how the interface should work was a tough road and cost a lot of time. Also, it required customers to change their behaviour which is inherently difficult.\n\nI'm ready for my next adventure. I'm leaning towards something where I can avoid the aforementioned risks. I've seen startups enter existing markets, and get massively successful by basically not doing a lot different. (ServiceNow, Salesforce etc)\n\nIm interested in some pitfalls with this approach. Specifically:\n\n\\- Incumbents will have more money. How do you fight that with less marketing budget?\n\n\\- People say you need to find a niche. How big of a separate niche does it need to be? Does it need to be superficial (eg marketing only) or does there need to be a tangible difference in the product?\n\n\\- I'd say big companies lack in development speed and customer service (because it's just difficult to scale those well). so that can be an edge. Does that work in practice?\n\n\\- How much is brand a factor here? Ive seen people fall in love with brands that have clearly immature products. Is it 'just a strategy' or is it a requirement? In other words, can you win if there is something already that people love?",

Less budget is what the niche is for, but building product specifically to that niche is part of how you win. Brand is a huge factor, maybe *the* factor. If your product is effectively a clone, you need who your company is to inform sales. Coke and Pepsi aren\u2019t *that* different, but you buy one at parties and ask for the other at restaurants.",

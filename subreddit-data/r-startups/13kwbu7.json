    "postText": "Edit)  We're still a small service, and suddenly we got a lot of people, so we were just looking at what was going on, and noticed something particularly strange. We were concerned of course, but we were careful to let the client know and they were open to a conversation. We don't monitor every site or every user all the time, and this was a unique case. We're just trying to make sure that our users have a stable site and that they can shape it the way they want. I just wanted to share our lesson learned, and I hope there's no misunderstanding.\n\n\\-----\n\nHi! We're a team building a lightweight webpage builder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe recently had a sudden spike in sign-ups and visitors, and the effect was so impressive that I thought I'd write about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a month ago, we were working on features and fixing bugs as usual, when suddenly one of our sites started getting a lot of visitors. Over the course of a few days, it grew and grew and grew until it was up to 100x the usual number of visitors to our other sites! When we tracked it down, we realized that a large entertainment company was using our service as an event page. We were surprised and puzzled because we hadn't contacted them first, or done anything noticeable yet (we hadn't even launched yet).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs we were celebrating the increased traffic, we noticed that some of the event participants were behaving strangely: some people were signing up with dozens of similar usernames to increase their chances of winning. We had found abusing!\ud83d\udc7e They had identified and exploited a weakness in our service, but the client (an entertainment company) didn't know about it, and we were worried. We thought it was something we could see happening again in the future, and we decided to let the customer know, but we also gave them as much raw data as possible so they could make their own judgment, not ours (of course, we're very privacy conscious!).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs it turned out, they were able to interpret the data well enough to weed out the abusers based on their criteria, and the winner of the event was determined fairly. We were relieved to see it go well. While we haven't yet seen the client hold another event, or convert all those visitors into new customers for our service, this serendipitous event gave us a chance to learn from it.\n\n* Improvements to the signup process\n* Ideas about what our service could be used for\n* tons of incoming data\n* An idea of what we could do to improve retention.\n* And other small bugs that came with a lot of visitors!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so glad we got to experience this kind of traffic before we officially announced our service to the world, and I wrote this post because I think every \bsmall service should experience it, whether it's accidental or artificial. What do you guys think? Let me know if you have any experience :)",

With fines of up to 20M EUR for violations, it makes sense to spend $10K+ on lawyers to make sure your entire livelihood doesn't get fined out of existence and so we have.  No offense intended, but that kinda makes me more than a layman on the topic, and I have real policy experts I pay to answer my phone call if there is a question.\n\nI'm not sure why you think it's illegal for EU companies to use US services- we have literally had thousands of EU companies and sole traders who have either use or are currently using our US based service.   There *is* a requirement that we are GDPR compliant, have a DPA, etc. We are.\n\nGDPR and all the other privacy laws are 100% focused on the *identification and disclosure* of what information we store, how we share it with 3rd parties, what types of information we are allowed to share with 3rd parties, how we process and/or secure your data internally, your right to access the information we store on you, and your right to request we delete the data we store from our servers.  There is not a single provision in any of these laws that prevent internal review of data stored on our service while you have an active service subscription (service contract) with us.\n\nIn our Terms and Conditions we simply state:\n\n&gt;&lt;Service&gt; has the right but not the obligation to monitor and edit all Content provided by users.\n\nOur AUP defines what kinds of content/data we don't allow on our servers. Some of this is for legal reasons and some of it is for moral reasons.  It specifically says:\n\n&gt;&lt;Service&gt; has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor or investigate any Materials and your use of the Services at any time for compliance with this AUP and the Terms and Conditions, or any other agreement between you and &lt;Service&gt; governing your use of the Services (collectively, the \u201cTerms\u201d).\n\nJust like you're agreeing to the fine print in an EULA when you install software, these collective \"Terms\" are a business contract you are entering when you sign up for our service and your consent for the data you store on our servers to be monitored.  This is 100% GDPR and EU contract law complaint. \n\nWe're not sharing your information with anyone here- we're technically internally processing your data to ensure legal compliance.  *There will never be a law that prevents us from following the law because thats... well, thats just dumb.*\n\nJust think about what you're saying for a second- it would be insane for me to give you a \"dark web directory\" on my web server where you could upload \"any data\" free from supervision or oversight.  \n\nYou could upload anything- nuclear secrets, child porn, pirated software from a multi-billion dollar company that can sue me out of existence with just the court costs, a database of stolen credit card numbers, your ex-girlfriends sex tape, etc, all of which has a real possibility of sending me to prison for helping you distribute.  Me going to court and saying \"Look bro, we just give them a folder to put \"any data\" in and we don't look at it, I dunno.\" is not a valid legal defense- by creating a system that facilitates your illegal activity my company is just as liable as if I knowingly helped you upload it myself.   \n\nThe only thing that protects me as a service provider is that I have reasonable controls to prevent that and a big part of those controls are reviewing account data *internally* either programmatically or with human eyeballs to make sure you're not using my company (and by extension me) to commit US state, federal, and international crimes.  \n\nHell, I don't even have to review it internally if I wanted to outsource it to a data mining company- *I just have to disclose that I do it in the GDPR compliant Data Processing Addendum.*  We don't do that for a range of reasons, from financial to philosophical problems with sharing that much customer data with someone else, but we could if we wanted to and it would be legal.\n\nALL THAT SAID, we really don't give a shit about an individual's data.   I remember when we started the service years ago and we got 1 or 2 signups a day.  I would get excited, pull their user up on the intranet, and see what kinds of things they were selling.  I'll tell my business partner \"Cool, this guy is selling rock climbing videos!\"  Even this cursory look for personal gratification was 100% legal- same as if I checked a new user and they had \"Cracked-Windows-XP-Pro_x86.exe\" as their product file and I had to take an account action (deletion of stolen software, account suspension, whatever). We're not getting a bunch of cracked Windows ISOs anymore, but this was 10 years ago.\n\nFast forward 10 years and I don't have the time, bandwidth, or interest to manually review accounts that don't raise a red flag through automated means. We have automated review scripts that run every night and check for specific things.  We have automated anti-virus scans that check for infected files.  We have algorithms that monitor log files for suspicious patterns of activity or network traffic.  I'm not going to disclose how any of these work, but they're effective and if I get subpoenaed to testify in court I can say with a clear conscience that we have made our best attempt to prevent illegal activity on our servers.\n\nI don't know why I'm even wasting my time writing this post arguing with a guy on reddit other than I think you have a fundamentally wrong idea about data privacy in general and I genuinely want to help you (and other startups in here that have the wrong idea) understand how data privacy laws really work.\n\n**TL;DR:**  *You have no expectation of data privacy from the people you are paying to store your data and it doesn't matter who you are or where you live and for good reason- its crazy.*",

I can look up someone in the DB that is down the street from me, go outside, and look for them.  I need GPS data to do most of the work I've done over the years and have never abused it, but I wouldn't mind a law that required I could only see GPS data far away and historical, or they have to agree to giving up full information to their GPS data.",

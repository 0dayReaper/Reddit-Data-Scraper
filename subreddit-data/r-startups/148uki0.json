    "postText": "I want to develop an MVP by myself and I'm choosing the most suitable tech stack. I'll use Firebase as my backend and I'm thinking about which one to choose between React and Svelte for frontend. Svelte is technically superior but it lacks dedicated UI libraries that could be critical to a solo founder/developer. but on the other hand, there are framework agnostic UI libraries like daisyUI and I wonder how they compare to framework dedicated ones. I'd appreciate any input from you guys. thanks for reading.",

React has alot of issues but has a large ecosystem and is very mature.  But it really doesn't matter.  You can also look at Solidjs which is react like.",

React sounds like the obvious choice here, not to mention if you ever wanted to extend functionality to a desktop/mobile app that will be infinitely faster to do with a React base. \nAlso worth noting that if you intend to build off of your MVP, you may want to consider an alternative to Firebase such as Appwrite or just writing the backend yourself",

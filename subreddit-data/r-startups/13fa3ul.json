We specialize in deploying Hybrid AI solutions, where most of the AI processing /inference is carried out on the consumer's device, with a fallback to the cloud infra (for any heavy lifting, or when the consumer's device is too weak). This saves enterprises data transfer costs, and cloud AI costs, while improving user data privacy.\n\n  \n**Available ML API and edge models:** Safe/Unsafe Image classifier, Fake ( Artificial Image classifier), Caption generator for Image.\n\n  \n**Feedback Requested:** At the moment, we're conducting user interviews to gather valuable insights on the hurdles and obstacles of integrating AI models. Some common challenges we've come across so far include cost, security, and a lack of skills or knowledge. We're eager to learn more about these issues and also interested in hearing from businesses that are already utilizing AI. Are you running batch training updates or real-time? We would appreciate any information you could provide on this topic.  \n**Seeking Beta-Testers:** Yes, we do have API users and would like to have some more. If someone is interested in deploying the models on the user's devices we would like to help.\n\n  \n**Additional Comments:** We are offering three months of free API access so that you can try out our models at https://skymel.com/api-services.html. Please note that more powerful and accurate models will be available soon.",

This is probably a bit of a niche product, targeting beginner-to-intermediate level players who want to improve their game.\n\nIt's often said that the best drill to become an expert at pool is to \"hit a million balls\".  Most of us don't have a table at home and can't spend enough time at a pool hall to do that, but this is the next best thing.  There are some skills that you can only learn at the pool table, but this will at least help you learn to \"see\" the shots correctly.\n\nFor more context, see my posts in r/billiards:\n\n[Project Announcement: Billiards simulator to improve your real-life game](https://www.reddit.com/r/billiards/comments/11rd0cj/project_announcement_billiards_simulator_to/)\n\n[Seeking beta testers for web-based billiards simulator to improve your real-life game](https://www.reddit.com/r/billiards/comments/13e2uzq/seeking_beta_testers_for_webbased_billiards/)  \n\n\n**Technologies Used**: Three.js, Vue, Django\n\n**Feedback Requested**:\n\nI've gotten a positive response from r/billiards, but I'm curious to hear feedback from more casual players.  People who don't play in leagues or tournaments, but still enjoy playing occasionally at bars or pool halls.\n\n**Seeking Beta-Testers**: yes\n\n**Additional Comments**:\n\nThis is currently a one-person project.  I'm open to partnering up with someone who brings skills to the table that I don't have.  I'm a developer, I mostly need help with design and marketing.",

            "comment": "**Company Name:** OLLACART  \n**URL:** [https://www.ollacart.com](https://www.ollacart.com)  \nPurpose of Startup and Product: The goal is to create a social shopping experience that combines discounts and comparison shopping so people can add something to their cart, know they are getting the best deal, and share products with friends in one place.  \n**Technologies Used:** MERN E-Commerce Stack, Chrome Extension  \n**Feedback Requested:** \n\nForewarning: Right now I've created a good portion of the user facing functionality aside from machine learning product suggestions and a complete social experience. The backend functionality (sending orders to retailers) is handled by a third party . Right now I haven't implemented the discount part for the user because it's going to be \"built in\" but it isn't yet. As it stands now is you purchase an item full price, and you get a refund according to the discounts we can apply for you. Yes, we are faking it untill we make it.  \nAnywho.   \n1.Can you give me feedback on how clear the add-to-cart process is, as well as give me insight into how you want to learn how to use the app and extensions - how clear are the tutorials are on the website? Generally, OllaCart is a crowdsourced database that requires the user to enter information. This allows us to be retailer agnostic :)  \n2.Would you use this app to purchase things online, if it was assumed that you added something to cart, and instead of a unique purchase process on some random website/adding your information somewhere, you have the ease of buying from OllaCart, save your personal information from being spread around, and automatically are refunded cash back, discounts, etc, shipping promotions, etc.?  \n3. Why wouldn't you use this product?  \nThanks in advance!!\n\n  \n**Seeking Beta-Testers: YES**  \nAdditional Comments:  \nThe product development goals are to integrate LLM for product suggestions that aren't ads or pay-to-play, and allow for any product anywhere online to be purchased with cryptocurrency. That and a lot more. Now, you can post a public list of products, directly share products, anonymously suggest products, anonymously purchase products, submit one purchase order for multiple products, and see what your friends also on OllaCart have added to their cart and decided to share.  \nThe concept is this is a BUYING experience when other websites are SELLING experiences. You add the product to your OllaCart, and you get the best deal.\n\nTLDR: [So I created an alpha to make online shopping easy (Extension and Web-App) and I am looking for some feedback. Please consider using my web application alongside the extension by going to www.ollacart.com, downloading the chrome extension and providing feedback via the portion on the bottom of the web-app that allows for feedback](https://www.ollacart.com)! Or leave feedback here for all to see :)",

Consider elderly people, for instance.\n\nSome insights for inspiration:\n\n\u201cAmid a looming financial crisis and a volatile stock market, many former workers are coming out of retirement and heading back to the office.  \nThe number of British people aged 65 or over entering the workforce rose by 173,000 in the first quarter of 2022, according to figures from the UK\u2019s Centre for Ageing Better. And a May 2022 report from AARP, citing data from Indeed, found that 1.7 million Americans who retired a year earlier had returned to the workforce.  \nKim Chaplain, a specialist adviser for work at the UK\u2019s Centre for Ageing Better, told the Guardian that the organization \u201csuspects the rising cost of living is playing a role.\u201d The Guardian profiled Bernadette Hempstead of Suffolk, England, who receives a small private pension and a state pension as a retired human resource employee. However, those two sources of income were not enough to cover her living expenses. \u201cAs things get more expensive, it became impossible,\u201d said Hempstead.  \nOthers are returning in search of social interaction. \u201cWe have a real  \nserious issue in this country of senior loneliness and depression. The pandemic really exacerbated that,\u201d Andrew Meadows, senior vice president at Ubiquity Retirement + Savings, told AARP. \u201cMany seniors were forced  \nto stay at home, and now they are thinking of entering the workforce again for social interactions.\u201d  \n\n\nWHY IT\u2019S INTERESTING  \nOlder generations are redefining traditional later-in-life stages, eschewing retirement in favor of employment\u2014whether out of economic necessity or in search of social engagement.\u201d",

However I am trying to validate that and one of the reasons for the survey is also to look at demographic data. I am going off a couple of trends and personal experience. One of the trends, is that a lot of folks are trying to move away from lower wage jobs towards reskilling and bettery paying careers. The second trend as you rightly mentioned,is  the rising age of retirement. And in my personal experience, people move jobs and switch even roles far more often now, than they have in the decades before.",

I understand you're financing it with subscriptions instead of selling people's data, but people using an app like this are obviously trying to save more money and be more financially responsible, so it doesn't seem like a great customer base to depend on for subscriptions. \n\nI'm big into personal finance FWIW, so I'd probably be in your targeted customer base.",

Save everything important for later - from notes and images to links.   \n2. Organize with ease - customize folders and categorize content for easy retrieval.  \n3. Never forget with helpful reminders - pick up where you left off and stay on top of your game.\n\nYou wouldn't have to go create any task, description, or even name it. You would just follow natural human behavior since there isn't always the right time to do something, and you will just postpone it, without creating some to-do.\n\n**Feedback Requested:** \n\nSo far I received feedback from a couple of people, that they would use the app, but not pay for it - there are similar solutions that you can use for free. The product would have storage server expenses, that wouldn't lead to a profitable business otherwise. Is it something you would pay for?  \n\n\nFeel free to try the prototype \ud83d\udd25  \n\n\n**Additional comments:** \n\nWe are at 3/4 of scratching this off since we can't see it as a profitable business.

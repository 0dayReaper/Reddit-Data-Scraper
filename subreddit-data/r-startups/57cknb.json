    "postText": "hey so this was a pretty shitty time for me obviously so I never shared any of this until now, but hope this helps some of you that are in a startup or want to start one.\n\nthis is how my startup failed, how i lost all my savings (around $50,000) I invested into it, my car and pretty much everything of value I owned, my co-founder/friend, and my health \u2014 all in about 10 months and what I learned from it.\n\nsome context:\n\n- I was a non-techie founder\n- this happened about 2-3 years ago when I was 22 \n- my 50k in savings came from a combination of online marketing stuff I was doing but mainly from a contract I had to do all the marketing stuff for the launch of a different SaaS company (not really relevant to this story but figured it would be asked)\n- the name of my startup or what it was about is also not really relevant here, since my f ups can be applied to whatever startup you are in or thinking about doing\n\nAlright here are my biggest mistakes and what I learned from them:\n____________\n\n**1) Don\u2019t limit yourself to starting only what you think could be a billion dollar company**\n\nSo with the 50k I had, I wanted to build not just *any* type of tech company\u2026 but the next Facebook, Instagram, Airbnb, etc. \u2014 point is something \u201cbig\u201d with millions of users. If you\u2019re cringing right now, I know.. same.\n\nThis was my first mistake.\n\nI mentally dove into that \u201csilicon valley\u201d dream/lifestyle and any great idea I had for a software that could actually help people but would only make say 5MM in annual revenue wasn\u2019t good enough. I only wanted to work on something that I thought could be \u201cepic\u201d (i.e. millions of users, top 10 tech company)\n\nSo many things wrong with this, but hope you get the point of how this isn\u2019t the right mindset.\n\nLesson I learned - you don\u2019t need to chase the next \u201cbig thing\u201d to have a successful tech company, and it could grow to that size without you initially thinking it would have.\n____________\n\n**2) Choosing your co-founder**\n\nSo I chose my college roommate to be a co-founder. Great guy, but he had no idea about marketing, no dev/design skills, wasn\u2019t investing any money, and was just willing to help. \n\nAs a lonely entrepreneur I thought it would be a great idea to work side by side with someone every day and could use the help. I gave him a %, but after like 6 months of work with out any pay and I\u2019m the one investing all the money he just easily backed out and went on his way and I obviously can\u2019t give up just like that. \n\nWe obviously didn\u2019t get along after that and I lost a friend/co-founder who had no business being a co-founder in the first place. In the end, it was a lose/lose, my fault for making him co-founder, and lost a friend.\n\nLesson - if you are going to get a co-founder, actually choose one for the right reasons. Avoid friends/family if possible.\n____________\n\n**3) Actually getting started**\n\nOnce I had my idea, I spent about 2 weeks deciding on a name/domain I should choose, then another 2 weeks getting a logo made and opening up an LLC. Did all of this before I was even clear exactly on what I wanted to build or if anyone even wanted it.\n\nYour startup will pivot in most cases before you make your MVP so the name and logo might not even be relevant. Time/money was used up, it shouldn\u2019t have been the priority when I was first starting out and set me back a bit.\n\nSo before you choose a *business name, domain, make a logo, or legally open up a business* (all the stuff most people get wrapped up with before starting) \u2014 get started by just locking in your initial team, getting clear on what you want to build, validating it, initial wireframes and your off to the races. \n\nA lot of work in that last sentence and everyone has their own way of getting started but the point is you could do all of that and more before even choosing a name. Don\u2019t let the \u201cformal\u201d stuff hold you back.\n____________\n\n**4) Get clear on what your actually making.** \n\nFor the longest time I wouldn\u2019t be able to describe what I was making in 1-2 sentences.\n\nThis is kind of my own made up rule, maybe it exists already idk, but rule of thumb: if you can\u2019t describe your startup in 1-2 sentences to someone not in your market and have them understand what it is, you\u2019re not clear on what you\u2019re building and is a sign of bigger problems to come.\n____________\n\n**5) Get clear on WHO you\u2019re making this for and how they can be reached.**\n\nThis was one of my bigger f ups. Fast forward 8 months to when I had something ready to get my first users.. I knew it was for *business owners* (B2B) but didn\u2019t realize that they are that much harder to reach (for me anyways) than consumers, and I also had the type of platform that I had to grow city by city (f\u2019ing nightmare). \n\nAfter a couple days of going door to door to businesses I could start to see how this was going to be a problem.. I didn\u2019t account for the time/costs it will take to reach my ideal customers. It was a big smack in the mouth.\n\nSo figure out WHO you are making this for and how you\u2019re going to reach them before you start. Just take that into account so you have the right expectations and you can plan/budget for it. \n____________\n\n**6) Talk to your ideal customers / \u201cValidation\u201d**\n\nOne of the most valuable things I ever did was go to a local business owner (my\nideal customer) and sit down to have jerk chicken with him in his restaurant.\n\nHe told me what he would like my software to have, and what he wouldn\u2019t like it to have. He told me the best features I could possibly put into my software.. essentially told me what I should build because he obviously would know what\u2019s best since it\u2019s for HIM not me.\n\nBad News: This was 8-9 months in after I built something pretty advanced already, and basically used up all my savings. What I did with him is something I should have done as many times as I can with multiple business owners before any code was even written.\n\nGood News: That jerk chicken was on point and he gave it to me for free.\n____________\n\n**7) Don\u2019t be a feature whore**\n\nI held back launching my MVP (minimum viable product, prototype, etc.) because I just kept adding *\u201c1 more feature\u201d* all the time. Since to me, if it just had this 1 more great feature it would make all the difference in the world.\n\nIt ran up my costs and time before launching it, and defeated the whole concept of an MVP in the first place.\n\nJust add all your ideas for features (most of which you should be getting from your ideal customers) to a bucket list and actually launch an actual *\u201cminimum viable product\u201d* that you probably won\u2019t be totally proud of. Will save you time/money. \n____________\n\n**8) Go lean. like Tarzan lean.**\n\nFor the love of (whatever you love a lot) PLEASE freken do this.\n\nOver 90% of my savings was paid to developers/designers for the build of it. And worse, I was paying by hour.\n\nPaying for dev/design work by *hour* for a new startup is an insane concept to me now. There are always gonna be bugs, something that doesn\u2019t work, something that needs to be added, etc. \n\nIf you are paying for a team or plan to, I would avoid paying by hour and just put them on a salary and set expectations for tasks that should be completed that week/month with them.\n\nAnd ideally, especially if you\u2019re a non-tech founder like me, PARTNER. Partner with a dev or whoever you need to make it work for equity, that\u2019s the only way I\u2019ve ever successfully been able to be lean and build a SaaS or any software with minimum upfront investment.\n____________\n\n**9) Don\u2019t waste money on legal stuff.**\n\nok that sounds like terrible advice (and I\u2019m not a lawyer so do your own thing) but what I mean is I spent about $3,000 on a terms of service and privacy policy before my MVP was even built\u2026 yah, I know\u2026\n\nMy startup had to deal with payment processing (at least initially before I pivoted) so I thought I needed it.\n\nPoint is, in most cases you can probably get a way with free (or cheap) basic legal docs. online to get started.\n____________\n\n**10) Funding**\n\ndon\u2019t count on funding/investment to get initial users/survive.\n\nI went through hell and back to try to get funding. Creating pitch decks, getting meetings with investors, the whole works. At one point, the majority of my time was spent just looking for funding for my startup instead of actually working on it. \n\nI needed funding to get users/traction. Users/traction (among other things) was needed to get funding but you can see how this could be an issue.\n\nLesson here is, unless you have the funds or team to get to traction then don\u2019t start it. (there are exceptions to everything but this just a rule I follow now for the best chance of success)\n____________\n\n**11) Advertising as your only revenue model is sketchy.**\n\nSo I thought I would just make my whole platform free for everyone and just eventually have ads on it when I would get \u201cmillions of users\u201d and then, boom, we\u2019re all rich..\n\nInvestors were like LOL, have a nice day (especially if you have poor traction). And yah it\u2019s just something I avoid now.. if you\u2019re going to make something that helps people, *charge for it.*\n\nNote: I\u2019m gonna get crap about this probably.. I\u2019m not saying this can\u2019t work, obviously it has worked for a lot of companies and continues to. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know how I would prove this but I would bet that a higher % of startups that rely on their business model to be revenue from advertising fail more than those that actually charge for some version of their software. if that makes sense at all\u2026\n\nSo point being, planning to sell ad space as your *only* revenue model for your startup is something I would try to avoid.\n____________\n\n**12) Caution with \u201cbrain drugs\u201d**\n\nThis is probably my most embarrassing mistake to share, and I think it fits here since your mind and health needs to be right to make your startup work.. \n\nI fell into the trap of thinking \u201cbrain drugs\u201d would help me get ahead.. From various nootropic stacks, to modafinil, to stuff like adderall or vyvance. I tried different types and ended up becoming reliant on it.\n\nSure I was able to grind out 15 hour days no problem.. then it turned to 24 hours straight, then 40, then before I knew it I went a couple days without sleeping, had a panic attack and ended up in the hospital. Dialed it down a bit but still was going at it too hard.\n\nSo pros.. yah I felt like a God and I would crank out epic amounts of work. \n\nCons - besides the anxiety I would get and panic attack mentioned above, the work that I did *wasn\u2019t better*, it was just a lot. And most of the time it was useless work, or work or tasks that weren\u2019t a priority. It affected my judgement and priorities of what I should be working on.\n\n(Note, most nootropic stacks are probably OK, but the modafinil, and harder stuff like adderall is what I\u2019m mainly referring too).\n\nOn that note, at the time there wasn\u2019t a damn thing I could read that would make me stop taking any of that so I don\u2019t expect you to stop immediately if you\u2019re taking it (even though I hope you would) but if you are thinking about starting to take anything like this, I would stay away from it and just be you. You\u2019re more than enough to build something great.\n____________\n\nAlright that about wraps it up. \n\nIn the end (after about 10 months) I had burned through my entire savings and cash from everything I had sold to try to make it work - my car, golf clubs, etc., I lost a friend/co-founder, and was pretty unhealthy mentally and physically. \n\nEventually I buried this startup and moved on..\n\nI ended up taking a couple months off before starting another SaaS with a couple friends, and with less than $1k invested between us, 3 months in we were live with sales and it was acquired 6 months after that. \n\nThis specific epic fail however and lessons I learned from it (although there have been many and I\u2019m sure more to come) really helped me with some of the wins I\u2019ve had and hope it does the same for you.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions and best of luck with your startups!",

However the users that are signing up are willing to pay for the 2 features that we have.\n\nOverall it is going very well. The biggest problem we have is that we underestimate the little details when developing the application. Our initial goal was to be in beta December 1, go live January 1. We went into beta January 3 we are hoping to be fully live sometime in February\n\n",

Sales is critical to the business, but you don't need a salesperson to validate. The initial value of the company comes from the product and it's validation, once you are at the point, you invest heavily in business development.\n\nAlso, building a product is easy if it's just a website, which seems to be what most startups are doing these days. If you are building something with real legs technology-wise, it's much harder to find qualified engineers than it is business people.\n\nI'm a techie, and I've done everything on the business side on my company: Management, recruiting, business planning and financial modeling, strategy, accounting, business development, raising money, and am now getting sales.  Everything on the business side is easier than programming, and for the most part is less of a grind.",

Most CTO level people I know actually are very good at strategy, analysis, and leadership.\n\nMy experience has been that having a business focused partner with you out of the gate is a horrendous waste unless they already have contacts that can help you drive business extremely early, like pre-alpha level. When you have 0 product, what sales are you going to do? If you have nothing to show yet, what is BD going to do?",

Plenty out there are hey, let's make Facebook but better and you do all the programming and I'll give you 5% blah blah.\n\nBut there is the other side of it.

He basically left and everyone said the product was going to die without him. \n\nSo I had a choice, do or die. I didn't want my product to die. \n\nSo I forced myself to learn how to program and write code, and guess what, it was NOT hard at all. It took me 1-2 years to learn it, but while I was learning it I was also building the product. \n\nTwo years later, my website (now mine only) is earning me extra money (pure profit) every month and my growth rate is 15% every month. It's not a great growth rate, but it keeps cash coming in along with my day job. \n\nAnd slowly I'm realizing now, not only do I have to build the product, but I have to do marketing, I have to think and make a money making system, I have to learn leadership and business, which is all things, looking back now, that my co-founder techie guy lacked. I highly doubt it would have gotten this far if it was only the techie in the picture. \n\nSo my advice is don't depend on a techie. In my honest opinion, you want to be a leader of a company someday you need to be a jack of all trades and do EVERY job, because you ain't got no moneyz to hire people lol. Also focus on getting users or customer base, or \"sales\". \n\nYou don't need a techie to build a product, learn it and do it yourself, especially if you know you got the leadership and the big picture ideas that techies will ultimately lack.",

I do free BD consulting with startup founders in the bay area (just to set the stage). Specifically B2B SaaS (so I totally understand not needing BD if it's a social app, etc).\n\nBD is often why startups fail. You need someone to focus 100% on revenue generation. Also, each interaction and sign up is an opportunity to learn from the target market. As a developer, you need to be focused on creating the product. Nothing will just \"take off\". The old adage of \"If you build it, they will come\" is bullshit. \n\nIn fact, BD is an equally important part at the early stage. Otherwise, you are essentially building blind. Building a product based on 1000 conversations with your target market before investing in other processes can be the critical difference between failure &amp; success. Far too many developers launch their business with a tiny bit of revenue and under 100 customers/users. \n\nBD should be the chief data scientist as well. What is your ideal customer profile? How fast do deals close? What is the average deal size, can it be increased by focusing on this vertical? By how much? Is this feature we are building helping out customers? How? Cutting 20% of their costs? By what measurement? You've had 100 users test the product, what was the average length of time from starting to getting value? How is value defined? Can we tie that into deal velocity to do better targeted reach outs?\n\nIdeas are easy, implementation is hard. Totally agree. If you want to find a good BD person, look at their work history. If that passes &amp; they agree to come on board for 0 pay, 100% commission, in return for significant equity (vests after 1 year), then you know they are willing to stake their livelihood on it. \n\n&gt; had a bunch of friends approach me with ideas\n\nUgh, I feel you there. I've made it a rule to never do a startup with a friend or family member.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If your idea is so good and you'll get so many money from it, you would prefer to pay me rather than give me a % of shares that will be, if your idea is that good, much more than that salary.\n\nSo when someone comes to me and offers me just the 50% they are telling me their idea is worse than paying me a salary and giving me no %, ergo they don't want to risk any money because they don't trust their own idea. If they'd trust their idea they wouldn't give me a % because nobody gives anything for free.\n\nTo summarize: someone offers you a salary in a startup = they believe in their idea. Someone offers you a % in a startup and no salary? they don't believe in their idea or are being very generous (not really the case).",

I do no coding (but I am learning!). \n\nCan you generate thousands of warm meetings? Try generating just 10 qualified meetings a month and I would be impressed. Also, try and pick up the phone and call 100 people, every single day, and email them the same amount. Don't forget to connect with them on LinkedIn and twitter.\n\nOH and in the off chance you actually sell a qualified meeting, you will have to make time for the demo, to meet each decision maker, know their needs and the pitfalls of the deal. After that, it's the trial period where 50% of your pipeline (which is really good by industry standards) falls off for a myriad of reasons. We also forgot the in person meetings, the flying/traveling the cheapest way possible, missing friends weddings, bdays, and family events.\n\nThen you gotta actually close the deal, provide ongoing support, create marketing material, and use all the data gathered from the process to redo the strategy. Rinse and Repeat 330 times (since sales can only take 30 days off, you need massive momentum).\n\nThat's just the sales part. There is still Marketing, partner, vendor management, HR, payroll,etc. Business Development handles that too, allowing the programmer to focus on delivering the product.\n\n150/hr is cheap by those standards. Anecdotally, I know hundreds of amazing programmers, but only a handful of business development experts. \n\n",

You need to make a MVP that works as fast as possible. At that step of a project, it does not matter if everything holds with duct tape.

I thought everyone has ideas, then there a bunch of devs that can make whatever I want doesn't matter who it is, I'm the one that makes it all happen and I can work with any dev. haha was I WRONG -- you need just a good a dev and design team as the other half needs to be as a marketer and someone that understands how to build a software company in general.\n\nhope that answers your question!

If you get a chance, take a read of Gabriel's book \"Traction.\"\n\nUsually a lot of emphasis is placed on \"The Lean Startup\" these days but I believe that whilst it's good, and really valuable, it does not encompass everything.\n\nGabriel writes that early stage startups should spend 50% of there time on marketing and testing traction channels, and the other 50% on product. \n\nThe ideal situation:\n* One cofounder works on marketing, customer development and feedback.\n* Second cofounder works on building the product. \n\nIn this way, product and marketing go hand-in-hand and complement each other. \n\nI've seen a lot of startups that will release a \"full product\" that's not lean / agile and have a lot of initial problems finding there first early adopters as they have kind of skipped this step (landing page, get some sign ups, do some blogging etc). \n\nDon't view your experience as a failure, see it as a learning curve.

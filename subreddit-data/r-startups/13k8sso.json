You can just do it, call yourself one.\n\nWhat does it take to have a really good chance of success as a tech co-founder?  Stuff like this:\n\n - Skills beyond just tech. You and your cofounder(s) have to play every role in the business, and if you can only do one thing, the other(s) will be overloaded.\n - Soft skills.  You and your cofounder(s) are going to interact on a daily basis for years before you find success.  You have to get along.  You're also going to probably talk to customers via interviews and/or customer support.  Soft skills helps there too.\n - Empathy for your customer. Ideally, a deep experience in the space that your customer exists.\n - The ability to talk to others in their language, to speak against their motivations and desires and strengths instead of your own.\n - Patience and the ability to eat shit for years while you navigate the path to success.\n - The ability to build whatever it is you're selling.",

For example just running a business is one thing, then its the whole business side of things, networking, funding, grants, hiring, sales, marketing, be visible...kinda everything else but the tech. I found that its more about the business side of things. I spend maybe 20% of my time \u00b4doing\u00b4 tech. Hope it helps.",

These people are often the ones that have achieved some level of success after making absurd sacrifices on their journey while behaving obsessively. They do this because they refuse to accept that they did not need to make all those sacrifices to be successful. Doing so would make them feel like idiots. So, they'd prefer to continue this toxic culture with others to avoid that.\n\nThe financial pressures linked to your startup are self-made and a result of poor management of your company, your resources, and the expectations you set (internally and externally). Don't rush. Don't over-promise. Don't over-commit. Don't over-hire. Don't over-extend yourself, your team, or your company.  Take things slower in the beginning when you are working with only assumptions and have so much core shit to test and validate. Take things slow and steady in how you start. Be strategic. Be calculated. Properly manage your risk. \n\nThe time pressure to outcompete others who will eat your lunch is one of those big pieces of bullshit. There is no pressure from this until you reach the scaling stage, at the earliest. No one knows who the fuck you are. No one is coming for you. There should be more than enough market share to go around to sustain your growth as a viable early-stage company. That is why you do proper Market Validation before you build your MVP and enter the market. There is no meaningful first-mover advantage in most situations--it is very rare to have that and be able to maintain that. There are far more advantages to entering the market later. You don't need to educate the market about a new product/service type. You don't need to be the one to forge a path within the market. You get to learn from the others that came before you, saving time and resources. You get to hit the ground running thanks to those that came before you that showed you what the market needs, wants, and lacks. Etc, etc. There is no time pressure to outcompete others. The best way to outcompete others is by providing a better product/experience that is more enjoyable to engage with while getting more benefits of the same ones with less friction. You can take your time to make that happen cause whenever you introduce it to the market, the market will want it.  \n\nWhen you are one of the 99% that are not coming from a place of privilege it is even more important to take your time and not rush--to understand it is okay and in your best interest to take it slow and steady to start. You have less room for error and more on the line when you take a risk. You are also more likely to be susceptible to desperation and fear because you believe your startup's success is your best path to financial stability and, ultimately, freedom. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Not to be a dick, but this sounds like the trite BS you see in ad copy before someone tries to sell you some \"easy way to have everything in life\" system.\n\nIt is **BASIC COMMON SENSE**. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Some companies - mostly not startups but rather small businesses - can operate like this. Startups rarely can. \n\nThis is bullshit.\n\nStartups are businesses that are designed to scale and grow rapidly.\n\nThat does not typically happen in the earliest stages of your startup's lifecycle. That is also something YOU have full control over. You control how many clients, customers, users you take on at any given time if you have massive demand. You have immense control over the supply. \n\nThere is no requirement to work all the time or even over 40 hours a week with your startup to be successful.  For the reasons I have gone over up to this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;You can absolutely have a life and some balance of health/exercise, family time, business, but it's borderline defrauding founders to act like this is the case in most scenarios.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAssuming the demand is high enough, that is when you can more easily bring on aligned, \"smart money\" investors at terms that are most favorable to you and your startup.  Those terms could include retaining the control of your company--allowing you to continue to maintain a healthy balanced life.\n\nIt is not borderline \"defrauding investors\" to maintain a healthy balanced life. The only thing investors care about is seeing a return on their investment. Taking a strategic and calculated approach that refuses to rush for the sake of rushing is not fraud or violating your duty to properly manage their investment. Especially, if this is increasing your chance of building a successful company that can generate a return on their investment.\n\nWhat you are suggesting is absurd and rooted in so much toxic bullshit that does nothing but rot the brains of people in their community and others.",

It's more of a situation where you have the skills that the company needs to succeed in their scenario.\n\nTech co-founder in a bootstrapped company where you're going to work 12 months with no pay or capital is completely different from a tech co-founder who can put together a vision to raise funding asap.  You're looking at it wrong because you're an engineer and analytical.  \n\nBeing a tech co-founder 5 times myself and CTO for more than 12 years, almost all of my situations occurred where people came to me based on my past successes or that I found them because they were looking for someone with my exact background.  Every 'requirement' you will see is custom tailored around what makes each business unique and how you fit into that story.",

But TechCrunch doesn't cover those unless it's a spectacular blow-up of a former high-flyer, so you never hear about the much larger population of startups that just never reached escape velocity.\n\nMake sure you're REALLY up for this. And I don't mean that like \"few humans are as great as us that can do it\". It requires a bit of masochism. The reason I do it is that, while no one likes working for someone else, I absolutely hate it and I'd actually rather make less money (if that's the choice) being the boss than being at a larger company.\n\nAnd I forget who wrote this (Peter Thiel?), but most people would make a lot more money being an early employee of an eventual unicorn than starting their own thing - if the sole motivation is the potential big windfall. There were secretaries at Microsoft who became millionaires.\n\nIf you're in a long-term relationship, you absolutely positively need to find out if your partner is up for the volatility and potential failure, and is REALLY okay with you giving up the safety of employment. And sometimes people think they're okay with it, but unsurprisingly change their minds if things fail.",

The most important things it takes to be a good tech cofounder, imo, is to learn quickly, build and rebuild quickly, know what is your weakness, and lean into strengths. \n\nIf data eng and science is your background, you can help your company differentiate with awesome pipelines that feed viable use cases. As someone in this space, you probably know how rare a strong data architecture and MLOps is in industry.\n\nAnd learning quickly is super important. Even if you aren\u2019t the most knowledgeable about a certain subject, getting quickly to speed is essential. If you don\u2019t hire to fill that gap, I recommend the build, destroy, rebuild loop as quickly as possible in your weak spots. You\u2019ll quickly see progress each iteration.\n\nBut if you can, bringing on team members with knowledge in your weak spot helps tremendously. Fortunately front end has a lot of experts and a lot of CS students cut their teeth in front end first, so there\u2019s relatively affordable and available help.\n\nYou got this OP",

For example, you may not know how to write react native, swift, or flutter, but if you have some understanding of why you would want to choose one over the others in a given scenario then that's enough to make relatively informed high-level decisions about them.",

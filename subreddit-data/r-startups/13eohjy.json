            "comment": "Hi there!  Sometimes it's easier to grasp a concept by seeing it in action rather than just reading about it in theory I agree with this point. \n\nLuckily, there are plenty of business books out there that cater to this learning style! A couple that comes to mind is \"The Lean Startup\" by Eric Ries and \"The Innovator's Dilemma\" by Clayton Christensen. These books use real-life examples.\n\nAnother great option might be to look for case study collections, such as the Harvard Business Review Case Studies.\n\nOr instead of reading you can check out some podcasts. Usually, I just search them on google by my favorite brands/companies/startups that I found interesting. You can check out the podcast with the founder of BOOM! by Cindy Joseph.",

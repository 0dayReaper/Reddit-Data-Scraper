    "postText": "80% of products and features are rarely or never used. Why? Because they're solutions for problems customers don't care enough about.\n\nI spent over a year doing 100+ customer discovery interviews only to follow the wrong problem. I've also spent 5+ years as a Techstars Community Leader and Global Facilitator helping hundreds of early stage entrepreneurs from around the world to validate their ideas and build first-concept products. If there is one thing I've learned, it's that *validation is hard af*.\n\nAt the end of March I came across [this thread](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376033582305615873) by Twitter-wizard and product management genuis Shreyas Doshi describing a validation method called *Customer Problem Stack Ranking* that they use at Stripe.\n\nSo I tried Customer Problem Stack Ranking out on my own startup and the value proposition that we spent 7 months of discovery reseach crafting came dead last with PMs.\n\nDead. Fucking. Last.\n\nWe learned more in 2 hours using this stack ranking approach than we did in 100+ customer discovery interviews.\n\nTo explain how Customer Problem Stack Ranking works, I'm going to take a startup idea that I've heard at countless hackathons; an app that makes it easier for a group booking their holiday to split the cost of accommodation and activities. We can call this hypothetical app *Splitzies.*\n\n\\--&gt; To be upfront, I did use my own startup's tool to carry out this stack ranking method but the technique is applicable beyond our survey product so I won't plug it in this post. This process helped us out a lot, so it's worth sharing regardless.\n\n## What is Customer Problem Stack Ranking?\n\nCustomer Problem Stack Ranking (CPSR) tells you how important your idea is compared to the other problems your target customers experience. It's a simple data-driven approach to understanding whether your idea solves a burning pain point  \ud83d\udd25 or just a mild inconvenience \ud83d\ude44\n\n## Step 1: Write Your Question\n\nCustomer Problem Stack Ranking is a type of survey so it needs a question, which usually goes along the lines of \"*What is the most frustrating aspect about \\_\\_\\_\\_ ?*\". Your CPSR question should be broad enough that it allows your participants to explore all the problems associated with an activity rather than just the specific problem that you're trying to solve.\n\nFor our imaginary app *Splitzies*, our 'activity of focus' is *booking a group holiday* so our question is: *What is the most frustrating part of booking a group holiday?*\n\n## Step 2: Turn Your Idea Into A Problem Statement\n\nAsking target customers to rate your idea is a bad idea. As Rob Fitzpatrick's book [The Mom Test](https://youtu.be/0LwbFZkyRKk?t=88) explains, if you ask people about your idea they'll just tell you it's great so that they don't hurt your feelings. Instead, we need to turn our idea statement into a problem statement so that we can compare it to the other problems that customers face in our 'activity of focus'.\n\nFor *Splitzies*, our problem statement could be: \"*Dividing the cost of a hotel booking is frustrating and complicated when planning a group holiday.\"* You can create multiple problem statements to explore the different pain points your idea might solve and the different words your target customers might use to talk about the 'activity of focus'.\n\nIf you're not convinced about the need to use problem statements, [here's a short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kPrLMchT5o) from a serial entrepreneur. If you're struggling to write your own, [here's a quick how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT0ZqwdPYRM) on problem statements.\n\n## Step 3: Create Peripheral Problem Statements\n\nBrainstorm problem statements that fall under the same 'activity of focus' but aren't related to your idea. These can be informed by a handful of interviews using open-ended questions or by reading some \"pain points\" related blog posts/forums.  We weren't super worried about missing some problem statements because the tool we used let participants add new statements for others to vote on.\n\nLets have a go at writing some peripheral problem statements for *Splitzies:*\n\n* *Keeping a list of potential Airbnbs and hotels turns into a giant messy spreadsheet.*\n* *Agreeing on dates that suit everyone is a pain!*\n* *It's difficult to plan activities when I haven't organised a transport method like car rental or public transport.*\n* *It's hard to find out how expensive a destination is for general things like food and transport.*\n* *Some destinations are very different depending on time of year but good information on seasonality is hard to come across.*\n\n## Step 4: Send Your Stack Rank To Target Customers\n\nSend your stack rank survey link to target customers. Pick one specific segment rather than a generic demographic to avoid noisy data. For example, if I send my *Splitzies* stack rank to both young parents planning a family holiday and student backpackers, they're going to have very different priority problems and our data will get all messed up.\n\nIf you haven't got a pre-release waitlist, hit people's DMs on online communities, forums and social media. We joined a few Slack communities for Product Managers and got +25% response rate on a couple hundred messages for a Customer Problem Stack Rank we did on our own startup (this outreach only took a couple of hours one evening).\n\n## Step 5: Iterate!\n\nYou start to see priorities emerge very quickly once votes start rolling in. As participants add their own problem statements, you'll also learn about new pain points you hadn't known about. Use these learnings to inform new sample problems and continue pushing your link out to participants.\n\n## Step 6: Results\n\nSort all the problems by highest or lowest importance to stack rank your statements. In one click, you'll know how important your value proposition is compared to the other problems your target customers face.\n\nLike I said earlier, the results of the stack ranking experiement we did on our own startup showed us that the value proposition we had spent 7 months building through customer discovery research came dead last for our target users. What was surprising though, was that our stack ranking helped us realised the big picture problem we were interested in was actually really important to our target customers, but they were using a *completely* different vocabularly to us. The words we were using couldn't have been resonating less.\n\nSo, we took the top 6 most important problems from our stack rank results and rewrote our entire landing page and onboarding experience. Now we're back to testing that proposition (early signs are showing better conversion, but we only just changed it recently tbh so it's still a bit early to say definitively).\n\n## Step 7: Go.\n\n***The best time to do Customer Problem Stack Ranking was yesterday.*** Whether you've got a killer idea for a startup or you're trying to align your existing product with problems that your customers actually care about, Customer Problem Stack Ranking is a versatile and flexible solution that's ready to help.\n\nLet me know what you think or if you have any startup validation/customer discovery horror stories \u270c\ufe0f\n\n\\--\n\nEdit 1: Thank you for all the love on this post, it has become on of the top 10 posts of all time on this subreddit. I built a free tool for Customer Problem Stack Ranking called OpinionX which you can find out more about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/mhzsna/share_your_startup_april_2021_upvote_this_for/gtv405p?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).",

We designed the tool we use for CPSR so that participants can add new statements to help you to fill in the gaps, dynamically updating your CPSR as you go.\n\nWith Mailchimp/Typeform/SurveyMonkey you can go for open-ended question with no way of stack ranking, or a multiple choice question with no way of finding your gaps. You need both -- which is why we designed our tool that way!\n\nThanks for the hard nosed question :)",

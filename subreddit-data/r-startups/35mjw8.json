    "postText": "Recently, I had the opportunity to discuss joining yet another early-stage startup as their first employee, go-to-guy and general, all-around ass-kicker. This is basically my favorite position. It's brimming with chaos, research, process definition, leadership, team-building and all the other aspects of work that keep me excited.    \n\nThe other thing it is, is totally, crazy risky. High equity, low salary and did I mention the chaos? Joining a team of less than 5 means you're going to interface with your founders and fellow team members in acts of design, definition and the discovery of what this company is really all about.    \n\nWhat happens when it turns out you had vastly different positions on this industry, this product, your users or what your job is? The truth is, if it doesn't come to light in the interview, you're facing probably a 1-2 year commitment of you being unhappy, because sad to say, you're probably not just going to walk out, despite anything you discover.    \n\nIn order to mitigate this risk, I've developed a series of questions that I ask companies during the interview process. In my own interviews, it's fairly common that I ask twice the number of questions the interviewee asks me. The secret side-effect is that not only do you discover what you need to know to reduce your own risk, but your curiosity and commitment will actually likely increase the chance you're going to get the gig.    \n\nSo, here's the (default) list I keep of things I want to know before joining an early-stage startup:    \n\n**Customer Data**    \n\n* Why do people sign up for products like this (what\u2019s their primary motivation?) Have you directly observed the reason users sign up for products like this?  \n* What mechanisms are we putting in place into the product to capture customer data and reveal it to our team (data science)?    \n\n**Competition**    \n\n* Who are our key competitors? First and foremost, do we agree on who they are -- and are we honest about who they are and how good they are?  \n* How big are our key competitors teams? Do we believe we can compete on their level with a smaller team, or that we really need to scale up to their operational size to really compete?  \n* How can we track competitive activity and counter or improve upon? (i.e. Trends, new features, partnerships)  \n* How many users do our key competitors have?    \n\n**Strategy**    \n\n* What can we fuck up and this will still be a success -- i.e. where do we have the least risk?  \n* What can we absolutely not fuck up, because doing so would spell doom for the venture? -- i.e. where is our highest risk?  \n* What are the organizational values, and how we think they might impact our day-to-day work environment?  \n* What\u2019s our first huge milestone after launch?  \n* What does launch look like, and do we agree on what a launch means?    \n\n**Team**    \n\n* What is the minimum required team we\u2019ll need in-place to build this product or to operationally run this product once launched?\nHow long before launch does an operational team need to be in place and not just a building team?  \n* In recruitment, do we need specialists in certain areas, .i.e. content genre specialists, legal issues, etc. to pull this off? We should identify these unique needs early.  \n* Do we have a formal group of advisors to assist in positioning and high-level opportunities?  \n* Do we have a formal board or accountability structure to keep leaders accountable and as a resource for employees?    \n\n**Budget/Money**    \n\n* What\u2019s our total runway? Our expectation of profitability in the first year? How much do we expect to spend on marketing?  \n* How much do we have to allocate to team growth -- equity, salary, etc.?  \n* What is our relationship with current investment and responsibilities and expectations toward them?  \n* What are our unit economics (or what might we need them to be for the venture to be profitable (i.e. acquisition cost per customer, customer lifetime value))?  \n* What do we need to export or be able to track related to accounting and measurement of business financial metrics?    \n\n**Technology/Product**    \n\n* If we've already started developing the product, what technology stack is it currently being developed in and is that a suitable one for scale/growth?  \n* Is it a technology stack that is especially easy or difficult to recruit in to?  \n* Out of what we\u2019ve created so far, do we have more than wireframes and actual code? Specifications? Feature documents? What are we creating that attributes to the posterity/learning of the product and features?  \n* What are the various data tables and data for each? i.e. X user, X group, X product  \n* What can we assume to expect to need in customer support and customer communication right out of the gate?  \n* What integration points have we planned for and what do we know we\u2019ll need (payments, analytics, stats, etc.)?  \n* What are our requirements related to security? Do we have any security risks?  \n* How are we logging activities and presenting those logs to assist with customer support?  \n* What will the product need to support in emails (product, marketing, transactional) to communicate with users?  \n* What is the financial situation of the economies we're selling this product in (taxes, app-store economies, etc.)  \n* Where do we draw the line with the proposed product so far? Is every feature absolutely required to launch? Do we have an MVP? Or, an idea of what\u2019s nice-to-have?    \n\n**Marketing**    \n\n* What is our marketing strategy for launch? For on-going?  \n* What are we expected to need in a marketing budget?  \n* What will marketing need in analytics or administrative functions to determine their effectiveness?  \n* What marketing opportunities exist that require budget versus those that don\u2019t (what have we yet outlined as tactics that are growth hack-y versus large campaigns)?  \n* What marketing-centric features (on-boarding, viral acquisition/social invites, drip campaigns) have we considered baking in to the product?    \n\n**General**    \n\n* What are we worried about? What keeps us up at night?  \n* What hard dates are we facing for product components/issues for the next year?  \n* How are we going to organize/keep track/stay accountable for all of our timelines/needs (i.e. what tools are we going to use to get this company going)?  \n* **As founders/organizational leaders, what do you see (or what would you like) your day-to-day responsibilities to be?**  \n* **What are aspects of your personalities as founder(s) that might make you difficult to work with on a company level? That will be things to overcome? Or, maybe better said, what are your quirks that we should be prepared to face as an organization? (examples being things like: I\u2019m terrible at responding to emails. I\u2019m always in convos with important people, so my schedule is crazy. I\u2019m hard to reach. etc. etc.)**      \n\nSo, that seems like a lot of questions, right? Well, you probably won't get to ask them all, to be honest. *Aint nobody got the time for that.* But, by asking the questions here that matter most to you, you'll start to get a few things clear before joining an early company, a set of cofounders or a new team.      \n\n1. How do these people think and do I agree?    \n2. How much thought have they put in to all the aspects of successfully launching a product, and if they haven't -- am I comfortable with that, or that I might need lead to us in these directions?    \n3. Honestly, are they on the level?    \n4. Are they honest about the state of their current industry and its challenges?      \n\nThe only sentiment I want to leave you with is this: You might assume that joining a startup means you're working with bad-ass Google types and high-performance killers, but the sad truth is that since 90% of these new companies fail -- they're not nearly as high-performance as you think. You need to take the discovery of how effective your potential founders and early team might be in to your own hands, because a **good idea** won't get you to the finish line -- **good teams** get you to the finish line.",

                    "comment": "It's really very dependent on location, role and the type of industry/expected team composition of the company in the first year. I once took a salary at $75K (somewhere around 60-65% market rate for someone in a product leadership non-dev role in NYC) to get 4% equity -- but ultimately the company fizzled and the equity was worth nothing. Which was a bit souring of an experience to have accepted such a low salary.    \n\nI think a good way to look at is to take a good average dropping off the couple highest and lower salaries of market rate for your role and experience level and then, if you receive an offer that is less than that but with equity (pretty standard) -- contrast the percentage rate of your equity times the difference in salary (over four years) to get a dollar value and think -- will the company be worth that by the time my equity vests.    \n\nAn example:    \n\nYou've been offered 80K and 1% equity. But your market rate salary is 100K. Over the four years your equity will be vesting, you'll be sacrificing 80K. So, do you honestly believe that in 4 years 1% of the company will be worth 80K -- or that the company, in total, will be worth 8 million dollars?    \n\nThat's the basic mathematical break-down I do when receiving equity instead of a better salary. Of course, then you compare that number against the qualitative idea of how much you'll actually dig the job and if you're cool with less money because of factors like a fun team, culture and shit like that.",

I will accept the $50k per year as long as I receive $50k worth of equity at the valuation set at the time I began to work for the company.

                    "comment": "I mean, I wish I could say that I planned to do exactly what you said or that it's even the truth, but it's not. I've gone through a few early stage startups because I didn't know to ask all those questions and learned the hard way. I've worked with multiple founders that were able to raise money, but knew nothing about software development and design and it plagued the product -- to get big contracts, but not lead teams effectively -- and plenty other issues that take a startup from hopeful to a disaster pretty quickly. I wouldn't think to ask these questions if I hadn't been part of companies in which not answering them screwed us.    \n\nBut, if you want to be attractive to companies as a first hire, I can recommend a few things.    \n\n**Be a developer.** Nothing else will come close to raising the likelihood that a company will be interested in you. I'm not -- so I'm never the **most** attractive first hire for many companies.    \n\nAnd just to add a caveat -- be a developer that can architect a system and product -- not just knows a language. You need to be able to lead the tech decisions.    \n\nWith that out of the way, **if you're *not* that, then be a T-shaped employee that can operate on both leadership/strategic levels and tactical hands-on levels.**    \n\nWhen I say be \"T-shaped\" -- I mean have deep experience in something that is valuable to early startups and then a broad experience in everything. The word getting thrown around for this right now is a \"full-stack employee.\"    \n\nThe deep skill-set that will raise interest in early startup teams of less than 5 is not always limited to the following short list, but having one of these deep skillsets (other than development, of course) will *generally* be most attractive:    \n\n* User Experience/UI Design\n* Growth Marketing\n* Product Management    \n\nWhile some startups hire for other roles in their first 5, those are the most frequent I've seen. My recommendation -- and why I think I personally am attractive for early-stage startups?    \n\nI have led teams in all three of the above non-dev roles. I can perform, to launch a production-level MVP in each of those without help. So, I say you should learn all three of the above. And not \"learn\" what they are, but scale them from being tactical and handled only by yourself to hiring and leading someone in that task.    \n\nAnd maybe another good note, depending on your potential founders' pedigree, funding and their skillset, I've personally always employed a commitment to bootstrapping when an early-startup. So, I've learned and I'm always looking for ways to accomplish anything under my wheelhouse as swiftly and inexpensively as possible.    \n\nI dunno man... that was a lot, but I hope it helps.",

You're trying to understand are these guys on the level to lead this product at this time in this industry? Have they thought about all of this?    \n\nThat's why I *totally* disagree. It doesn't take that much for some MBAs to wheel and deal their networks for a quick $1mil angel investment and seem like they've done due diligence on their industry and how to lead this project, but if you're about to invest two years of your time and your resume in to it, you need to start with as much knowledge as you can get.    \n\nOf course these are obvious for most startups, but maybe you're thinking of this as an interview with an established startup like all the other established startups out there. For every established startup you know that made it, five never made it past seed-stage because they didn't actually know all this shit. That doesn't mean thousands and thousands of people aren't joining those early-stage companies and working on those products right now.    \n\nAnd you're right -- the email question wouldn't prevent me from joining -- it's just something to ask because I'm a product guy at heart and I wanna know if I need to think it through/build it.    \n\nAnd just a note on analysis paralysis -- I don't think this screams that I'm not going to get anything done at all -- to me, it's the honest answers I need to start to work on user stories, prioritization, a roadmap, a dev process and figuring out what the Hell this company might actually need to get kicked off.",

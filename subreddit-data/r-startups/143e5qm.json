    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am 47 years old. I run a design studio in New York. I opened an online store at the suggestion of a friend. The difference from Amazon is that it does not need to accumulate too much inventory. After the customer places an order I pay for the goods and then ship the goods on the platform. After waiting for the customer to receive the goods, I receive the profit difference that belongs to me. In the past few months, my monthly profit has been between 40K and 80K. I am now considering whether to close My studio concentrates on running my online store, do you have any good suggestions for this?",

It sounds like on the Amazon side of your business you click a few buttons and it's done. Really it comes down to if you don't want to do any work, or very little work. Either way would tell me how to go about it. If you didn't want to do anything build both sides and then sell the business. If you would be ok with a little work, then sell the studio and focus on Amazon.",

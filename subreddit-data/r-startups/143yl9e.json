    "postText": "I recently started working at a startup company and I have a salary review coming up. I'm not entirely sure how to evaluate the equity offered to compare the startup salary to market value salary but here's the position details: \n\n  \nPosition: Entry Level Medical Device Engineer   \nCurrent Salary: $65,000, no benefits at this time  \nStock Options: 375 of common stock vest after 1 year, 1500 vest after 4 years\n\n  \nI was wondering if anyone could explain what vesting means? In addition, I was wondering what questions I should ask about the stock options to better understand what they could be worth?",

Questions for you to ask at the end. \n\nBasically what they\u2019re giving you is the \u201coption\u201d to purchase stock in the company. \n\nFor that reason, there are a few things you need to know to understand how to value them. \n\n1. What is the \u201cstrike price\u201d, or how much it costs to purchase the option?\n2. What is the Fair Market Value of the shares? This is the last priced equity they\u2019ve sold (likely in a Fundraising event)\n\nThe value of each share can be calculated as FMV minus strike. That will give you the value of each share, and then multiply it by the number of shares. \n\nVesting means you don\u2019t get them all at once\u2014you have to earn them with your time. A cliff means if you quit before the cliff, it doesn\u2019t matter if you were 11 months in, you don\u2019t earn any of the options. \n\nThe article talks about all of this in a lot more detail. Good luck!!",

You\u2019ll get the gist, it\u2019s not too complicated.\n\nThe options are worth nothing and likely never will be.  Even if your company somehow beats the odds and those shares are not worthless, your stake just isn\u2019t enough shares to amount to much more than maybe a few nice meals or a budget vacation.\n\nI say this not to be harsh, but so you understand what you\u2019re working with.  At this point in your career, focus on career growth and salary.",

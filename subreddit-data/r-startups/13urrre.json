Besides that, we have presence in some socials.\n\nWe have 4.5k paying users.\n\nThere's one customer in our lowest pricing tier that will always reach out to us via Twitter.\n\nWe try to redirect them to our live chat every time since it's the fastest and easiest for us, but they won't listen to us stating that they are not want to talk to chatbots. Our live chat is fully managed by humans, and they know, but they do not want to listen.\n\nWe get 10 tweets a week from this person. Each time it gets worse. They have started being offensive rather than rude or non polite.\n\nAt what point should we consider blocking them from our socials?",

I\u2019d invite them to a big call, send them food and have an agenda to head them out and address the product concerns and you address your relationship concerns. I know an excellent customer experience consultant. If you\u2019re interested DM me. Remember this is a potential goldmine.",

            "comment": "Looks like a cool tool. For the home page, I recommend that you make it very clear how your product is positioned against everything else out there. For example:\n\n* How is this different than Photoshop\n* How is it different than Canva\n* What benefit does this have over hiring a designer\n* How easy is it to get results\n\nThere are tons of design tools out there, so you want to make sure you're expressing your differentiators. You don't have to name other products, but you should know that someone has those in mind. So your problem statement has to be super-clear, above the fold, and something you can hang your hat on. The main description has a lot of buzzy words that might resonate with VCs, but has no bearing on your target audience. Everything is cloud-based now. \n\nYou also want to make it clear who this is for. There's an impulse to want to say it's for everyone, but it's not. (at least not yet). Start with your core target and refine the messaging for them. You can easily expand later, but try to hone in on a unique use case. An ad designer is going to have very different requirements than a content marketer who makes infographics.\n\nGood luck!",

Maybe it's adapting designs at scale for productivity? A great way to show that would be to show dozens of versions of a graphic for a range of delivery media. (Haha, you could even eat your own dog food and do the designs from Typevis and say: \"These 20 graphics were created with Typevis in &lt;5 minutes.\" or something like that). Another way to show ease of use would be to let the person manipulate the graphic on the home page.",

I had the aha moment when I went through your comments here.\n\nSome ideas on how to make it better.\n1. Subtitle should be fast to read like the title. E.g. just keep the juicy part \"Automate and scale\u00a0your marketing quickly.\u00a0No coding\u00a0required.\"\n2. Merge the two first points to a header \"Design once, export everywhere\". (This could be the subtitle as well.).\n3. Add a \"How it works\" with steps OR \"Why choose us\". And put all those things in something easier to consume.\n4. Allow me to click on the image on the hero section or make cropped versions. On my phone the image looks tiny so from UX perspective it's terrible since it's unusable.\n\nI think you've been working too long on your project, that you're too much into it. You need to zoom out and think how an outsider will be able to grasp your project in &lt;5secs\n\n(From someone who also has been working 2 years on their project and doing their landing page.)",

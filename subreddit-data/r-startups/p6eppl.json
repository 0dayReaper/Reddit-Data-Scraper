    "postText": "I\u2019ve been running a SaaS company for 7 years now. In the last 2 years business just took flight, and we\u2019re definitely satisfied about our solid market and the results. We never had interest in selling, but today a big foreign company showed interest in the business, and asked for a videocall next week. They know the business is going well and that\u2019s why they want to buy it. How should we behave during the videocall? Should I prepare something to show, or should I just be answering questions?\nI\u2019m really not interested in selling, so I\u2019m listening only if the offer is outstanding, should I be honest from the beginning?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

Get them to pay for legal fees post-HoTs agreement (probably capped). Establish the data room philosophy for due dil. That\u2019s the high level stuff. Biggest risk in a deal is time = higher risk of variables coming into play where the buyer changes their mind. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t get distracted from what your core business is doing well at, whilst deal is under discussion. Tell the truth. Take legal advice always.\n\nEdit: data room",

An Investment banker would cost the OP $0.00 to have listening in on that phone call.  \n\nThis is like going into court for a felony charge.  You don't do it without a lawyer.  Even if the buyer offers the right price in the OP's mind, that's only half the battle.  Unscrupulous buyers can undermine a deal later when the seller is powerless to fight back.\n\nThe house I live in was built by a guy who sold his life's work for a mega price.  Two years later, the buyer quit making payments and the seller lost his home, yacht, and retirement money in the process.",

He built a farm surrounded by national forest where there are few people who could afford his set up.  Lucky for me, he didn't find a buyer for a couple of years until he got desperate.  I was able to buy this place for about 20 - 30 cents on the dollar as built.\n\nHe was an angry and bitter man. It was the most difficult home purchase I've ever been through because of his frequent outbursts and accusations of fraud.   He hated me, his realtor, his lawyer, everyone in the process.  \n\nIt wasn't until a few months after the home closed that one of his former employees explained why the seller was so bitter.  He had thought he had it made for the rest of his life and everything was taken away from him after only a couple of years.  It's why I'm so adamant that  someone not sell their biz without professional and experienced assistance.  It doesn't guarantee a great outcome, but it certainly improves the chances enough to be well worth the cost.",

            "comment": "Here are my two cents:\n\nBe very careful. Big companies are mostly filled with normal boring nice people. But there are always sharks; sharks who hunt and viciously kill to get ahead. Sharks often run their acquisitions departments. These sharks are usually super charismatic and your new best friend until they have sucked you dry. Then they kick you to the curb.\n\nThere are a few shark tricks they can play:\n\n* \"buy\" 20% of your company or some other small amount for a pretty generous price which gets them solidly into your customers, contracts, and code. They then steal what they want and then tell you to lose their number.\n\n* Companies that are just doing research. They get you all hot and bothered and will try to get you to tell you as much as they can learn, which goes into an internal report, then they tell you to lose their number.\n\n* Companies that will begin an M&amp;A but start pulling you this way and that while looking for some weak points. It might be they identify a few key staff who they either steal or they \"convince\" them to help out by giving them the goods. Once they are done they tell you to lose their number. \n\nWhat is best is if you think this is going somewhere but before you get into any details beyond what they could glean from your website, you should find an M&amp;A firm. There are lots of little ones that have done similar deals and will be looking for maybe 6% of the deal. Normally you have to put up some cash up front but they may wave this in the case of your having already nailed a solid prospect. These guys have seen it all and will prevent you from signing a contract full of pain and suffering. They will also professionally negotiate. This means you will get something closer to the best deal long and short term. That 6% will be well earned in that often you will end up with a better deal worth far more than their 6% than you and your local lawyer could ever have landed.\n\nHere is a simple example of what an M&amp;A firm will bring: They will research the company looking at you and see if this company plays fair or is a zero-sum type bit of nastiness.\n\nM&amp;A firms also have 1000 tricks for what they do. Often they will bluntly ask what kind of price range is on the table. This sort of question really sorts the tire-kickers or super low-ballers from the qualified possibles.\n\nLastly an acquisitions department will often react very positively or very negatively to you brining in an M&amp;A firm to represent. This alone is a fantastic test. If they react positively it generally means they plan on an above board serious plan to acquire you for a reasonable price and they are happy to now being dealing with professionals even if it is going to cost them a bit more as the process will be far smoother for all. But if they react negatively it means they were planning on pulling some kind of shit and again you will find this out without wasting hardly any time.\n\nOne other thing, get another interested party asap. There is an old saying:\n\nOne camel one arab, bad price.\n\nOne camel two arabs, great price.",

If there's no data on this niche then there isn't much research they can do. If the market is hot and acquirers are coming to you, there's probably no roadshow or any fancy sales materials you need to prepare. If you already have a lot of eyes on you and/or the acquirer is the best strategic buyer and/or has a reputation for not trying to lowball on acquisitions, it doesn't make sense to throw away that 4%-6%+ on a deal you can get on your own. Some acquirers get turned off if the company hires a M&amp;A person that plays it wrong or wants to hold up the deal so they can take a few months to call all their buddies from business school, and have the company spend hours pitching buyers that aren't interested, all to squeeze another 2%.\n\nIf the company is doing well and you don't need the money, and the market is hot (like right now), you hold all the cards. Make the acquirer sell you on selling. Don't share anything you don't want to share. M&amp;A advisors are great if the market sucks and you just want out or the company is really obscure. Otherwise a lawyer that's experienced on the founder/seller side (not just a general corporate/transactional lawyer, but someone that sells tech companies all day) will protect you better during courting, know what's market, manage due diligence better, and charge a lot less. Get them involved before your first meeting with the acquirer.\n\nYes I'm biased.",

I have worked on deals from $20m to $475m on the buy and sell side and have not seen a seller pay anywhere close to 4%, ever.\n\nThe advantage of using a banker is not \u201csqueezing another 2%\u201d.  Instead it is:\n\n- creating a competitive environment that at times can drive an absurd price\n\n- increasing certainty of closing by maintaining backup suitors \n\n- holding the buyer accountable including via reputational capital. \n\n- being an actual professional with many reps on trading high value complex assets versus \u201clearning on the job\u201d as you sell your life\u2019s work.  How dumb!!!\n\n- acting as a mediator in the deal so that you don\u2019t end up hating your new boss!  Invariably when you get into negotiating your reps and warranties, holdbacks. deferred revenue obligation and PPP loan forgiveness I can promise that you will end up fighting with your buyer who is likely your new boss, and this sucks for both of you.\n\nHaving done many of these deals from both sides, the sellers who did not use a banker were total rubes, they did not get max value and their general diy mindset was a huge limiting factor in their life.  Zero times did they have real investors.  Don\u2019t be a rube.  Don\u2019t sell yourself short.  Use a professional.  \n\nNote: I cannot stand parasitic percentage based service providers like realtors, and avoid them at all costs, but a good investment banker helping you sell your company when the time is right is the best money you will spend.",

                            "comment": "&gt; Whether you need the M&amp;A adviser\n\nIf you are merging or getting acquired you need an M&amp;A firm. I might sound like I am shilling for one but having been involved in a number of M&amp;A events I have seen what a good one can do. Deals are falling apart or going sideways and they just glue it all back together. Even though they work for you they almost act like a mediator between you and those acquiring you. They want the best deal for you, but they also want the deal to happen at all. But they also want a deal that results in both parties being happy enough to recommend them as in most markets the world is a tiny place. Thus a good M&amp;A firm is more likely to tell you to pull the plug on a deal that will end up sucking.\n\nA lawyer is OK with the details that prevent lawsuits but I find the M&amp;A people have a bigger picture of the business and more experience with all the little gotchas like vesting, tax wrangling, employment contracts, and how to properly spread the love if you are going to throw some of the sale to your employees. \n\nFor example. In the last M&amp;A I witnessed the whole deal went sideways in the middle. It appeared to be a huge bad faith event on the buyer's side. But it wasn't. They were just having a big HR issue that spilled into the deal. They wanted to postpone which sort of seemed reasonable. The M&amp;A people said, \"That, quite simply is not going to happen.\" It didn't happen. When it came to setting up the employment contracts for the bought out key personnel they were able to walk a fine line between what worked for the buying company and what worked best for the people. The buying company wanted more salary and less buyout cash. But buying the shares for a higher price is better for taxes. Then you get vesting, etc. \n\nIn the above the company made it pretty clear early on that they didn't really want the key employees, but were now stuck with them for 2 years. The 2 year contract was then traded out for a mix of cash and options. This meant that the key personnel did quite well. \n\nBut one of the best bits is that they can take one look at an offer that I would have thought was amazing and show that it was loaded with potential gotchas. For example. When you go into due diligence they get to pull out of the deal if you have over-hyped the state of the company. But before you go into due diligence you need to nail down what they can expect to find but only in vague terms as you don't want to list all your customers and show them your source code, etc until you have a firm commitment. This means you need to precisely describe the state of your sales pipeline your existing contracts, your cashflow, etc but in ways that don't give away secrets. This alone is a dance best between your M&amp;A people and theirs.\n\nAs for throwing away that percentage. I can not state strongly enough that no company I have seen use an M&amp;A firm regretted that percentage in that they more than got it back with a deal that they could not have negotiated themselves. And as I said before, any company turned off by you getting an M&amp;A firm is highly likely to have been planning on a ripoff. This last is where a local M&amp;A firm to ideally you and the acquirer is great as they have a network of contacts that will be able to give them the dirt. As for them delaying, that would depend upon the arrangement. If you have already lined up a buyer or two then they will just focus on the deals at hand. If you want them to go out and find buyers then often they want you to pony up some fairly solid cash as that might not even pay out at all. It would be very odd if they tried to halt a solid deal sitting in front of them that you have set up for them to go chasing ghosts. M&amp;A people tend to be very atavistic types. If you have a 10 million dollar business and they can poop out a 600k commission in 3 months or a possible 800k commission in 6 they will go for the 600k here and now. With M&amp;A firms they know the market can turn on a dime and all their deals dry up overnight. Delaying would be against their very nature and experience.\n\nThe other reason to get them in on a deal fairly early is that a good Acquisitions department will try to get commitments from the naive very early. Something like an exclusive where you won't continue to shop the company around for X months, or they will get you to commit to some \"facts\" that will be later used in due diligence, or get you to spill some secrets to \"impress\" them. This is the sort of crap an M&amp;A firm will shut down hard. BTW those sort of commitments might be found inside what was supposed to be an NDA they wanted you to sign.",

You'll never know what your company is worth without holding an auction.  You get an investment banker to conduct an organized sale and hopefully get multiple interested buyers in a bidding war.  Taking a price just because someone hit what you think is a great price can mean you're leaving big $$$ on the table.  \n\nI sold my first good sized company and the buyer wouldn't pay $1 for a subsidiary, so we spun it out into an independent company that would eventually sell for 100X our original asking price.  Yes, lots of growth happened in the interim, but we didn't know what we had until an auction happened a few years later.",

This is surprisingly important to many small businesses.\n\n-What is the present value and future value of the money you\u2019d receive? Or, how long would it take you with your current trajectory to meet that?\n\n\nKeep in mind SaaS valuation is very variable. SaaS can range anywhere from 2-8x (I\u2019ve seen higher but this is average) revenue.\n\nId also consider thinking about your product and what the buyer would use it for... It\u2019s not always obvious, and could change value negotiations.\n\nEdit: formatting. Other people gave really good advice about NDA\u2019s and diligence, so this is just general thinking points.",

If they want to buy you it\u2019s not really going to be up to you, unless you have aspirations to be a public company ceo etc\n\n- odds are this isn\u2019t as serious as you think.  I started a saas company and sold it after 10 yrs for $200m.  Along the way there was a major large company \u201cinterested in buying it\u201d every 3 months.  Be polite but be busy and brief.  If they are serious it won\u2019t matter\n\n- if it progresses definitely hire a banker.  You will want them to do a \u201cmarket check\u201d where they call 10 strategics (competitors of your suitor) and 10 pe firms and drum up interest.  If there are less that 3 other interested parties you are likely not gonna get a premium price.  \n\n- what is a premium price? You haven\u2019t shared any metrics but for a \u201ctypical\u201d 5-10M arr (and I mean real contractual arr) b2b saas co with 100%+ net revenue retention and 100% arr growth year over year you should expect 10x current arr as a \u201cgood\u201d deal, if market.  Assuming 100% cash.\n\n- if your company is attractive and say over 5-10m arr you have another awesome option which is a majority recap from a private equity firm.  This is where you can sell them 60% and \u201croll\u201d your remaining equity.  So if you have typical founder equity you can cash in life changing money, be comfortable but continue to have big upside.  Worth considering.  The downside is that your new boss is a Harvard mba spreadsheet jockey who is calling you everyday.  His boss will eventually fire you and replace you with a moron.  It\u2019s ok though you still will have equity and be richer than both of them.  And liquid. \n\nIn summary take the call, be brief, be bright, be gone.  Apply a 90% discount to your belief that they are serious about buying you, you will know when that is the case (because their ceo will tell you he has board approval etc).  And if it progresses, hire a banker.   Pm me if you want some recommendations, just went through this.",

This will make sure they 1. don\u2019t drag their feet and 2. are serious about an offer/aren\u2019t doing this for the wrong reasons\n- Have an internal walkaway point. Be honest about it - as a founder who has poured their life into the company, it\u2019s easy to think your walkway point is higher than it actual is when cash is in front of you\n- Try to get a sense of their range without revealing your own. 95% of the time they\u2019re looking for a cheap acquihire that would fall well under your walkaway point\n- Don\u2019t reveal anything about your business (KPIs, product insights, financial terms) until you get an airtight NDA/MNDA. This should happen at the start of the process before you talk terms\n- Understand why they are buying you: the value add to their business and their alternatives (build in-house, buy a competitor). This will help you estimate their range\n- Once you\u2019re serious about selling, tap your network and run a competitive process (reach out to competitive buyers). This is something we didn\u2019t do and is one of my biggest regrets\n- If your alternative path (growing the business) is compelling enough, don\u2019t be afraid to walk away. You have a small chance of losing the deal for a larger chance at hitting the top of their range and significantly increasing the purchase price\n- Once you get an LOI with negotiated terms, it will feel like a huge milestone. However, you\u2019re only halfway there\n- Hire a good M&amp;A lawyer but only once you have a signed LOI. Don\u2019t feel bad about paying ~$300k+ for a midsized deal (&lt;$100M). The amount of heartache a good lawyer will save from the hundreds of contingencies is more than worth the cost\n- If it\u2019s an all stock or cash/stock transaction and the buyer is a private company, negotiate the price of the stock. Everything is negotiable\n- As much as you want to, don\u2019t tell employees until the deal is almost done. One of the worst things that can happen is for the employees to expect a fantastic outcome just to have the deal fall apart. It could irreversibly hurt employee morale to pull out and gives you a weaker position at the negotiating table (you\u2019re more \u201cpregnant\u201d with the deal, in M&amp;A speak)\n- Don\u2019t worry about \u201cselling out\u201d or coming off as opportunistic if the terms are right for you. You\u2019ve been building your business for 7 years and some liquidity could be life changing. Entrepreneurship is a long term game and you will have many chances to build a billion dollar business\n- Try to get some sleep. The process is stressful, the stakes are high, and it\u2019s important to stay fresh and periodically decompress\n\nGood luck",

Just be open to discussions, answer their questions, be honest about what you want, and if they hit a number that makes sense to you lawyer up and go for it. One thing I'd say is not to give them your trade secrets or anything else proprietary until the deal is completed.",

Same with sharing any database information. From what I gather from your story it sounds like they just want to meet up and get acquainted and share their motives. Then they might ask some questions but most likely if interests align schedule another meeting.\n\nAssuming from what you shared let them lead and see how it goes from there. Just make sure you thought about what you are willing to share. Keep in mind that what you share should have the purpose to increase their interest in your company and it\u2019s price. Not the option of them developing a similar company with the by you provided data. Or maybe buy a smaller competitor and speedrun it with your data.\n\nOther suggestions as in have already a price made up sounds pretty premature. You don\u2019t know their intentions yet and how serious they are. I have a hard time believing that they throw in a number in the first meeting you guys will have. And they most likely won\u2019t throw a briefcase with money. It will be most likely a (temporary for transition) position, stock and money.",

Here's some advice to keep in mind:\n\n\\- Being approached by a large company is more common than people think. Around 1/3rd of the companies in my accelerator (TinySeed) have been approached about a possible acquisition.\n\n\\- Remember that the most likely outcome is that no deal happens, for one reason or another (usually valuation).\n\n\\- I advise people to have the conversation, but work hard to avoid being distracted by it. That's one of the biggest mistakes you can make here - sinking a bunch of time or headspace into a deal.\n\n\\- The 2nd most likely outcome is it's an acqui-hire where they offer you a few hundred thousand dollars to come on as an employee. Most of the offers I see are of this nature, so know up front whether that's interesting to you.\n\n\\- Have them sign an NDA before you disclose anything, and certainly be aware they may be asking you for info that they will use to compete against you later. That's a risk you take with a conversation like this.\n\n\\- Read John Warrilow's *The Art of Selling Your Business.*\n\n\\- As another commenter said, feel free to reach out to me if you want to get my thoughts.

Remember that.\n\nIf they are looking to buy you let them open up. Let them tell you all the reasons. Let them sell you. If they give you negative comments about the business, side step them and tell the that you'll look into those topics. Your MAIN focus with the initial call is to LISTEN, that is it. After the call you should have a lot of information about what they are wanting from you. If you listened to what they said you will be able to know exactly what they want. \n\nIf they bring up price lead them to tell you first. do not i repeat, do not give them a number. You job is just to listen to them. Do not tell them your figure first. if you do you will lose.\n\nIf they give you a number do not counter, do not get excited if it is more than you expected. Stay calm and ignore it, change the subject. You will counter when you have the next call with them.\n\nUse the information from this first call to strategize and plan for the next call.\n\nNegotiations are a war and you will win some battles and lose others but the idea is that you win the overall war. \n\nIf you have further questions let me know.

So manage your expectations and emotions.  \n* Think of 'best owner principles' and why the buyer side M&amp;A guy feel that doing a deal makes sense?  And how do you imagine him/her selling the deal to company's board?  e.g. This would be talent acquisition play, or they have existing sales/distribution they can leverage, or they just need to show revenue growth.\n* \"Data Room\" like other Redditors suggested.  I would also consider creating a 2 page sale sheet (analogous to how realtors have to sell homes) also.  To me, it's helpful to have a cheat sheet of all the information I'm ok with sharing and how I want to position the deal.  This is also helpful for their M&amp;A deal sourcing guy to explain what your company does and get buy-in from others on the M&amp;A committee within his company.  \n* I would look into valuation comparables.  Put it in a grid.  But remember that valuation is still just whatever somebody is willing to pay for something.  All financial calculations are just a way to justify the price.\n* Know what you want.  Not just sell price.  Would you be open to staying on with the company after?  How long?  Would you be ok with them making an investment for 10% or 50% or 65% of your company instead?  What would like to see happen for your team post deal?\n* Understand the acquisition deal funnel process.  ID company, 1st meeting, letter-of-intent, due diligence, closing, company integration (people, processes, places).\n* Make sure the process does not interrupt your business",

You'll never know what your company is worth without holding an auction.  You get an investment banker to conduct an organized sale and hopefully get multiple interested buyers in a bidding war.  Taking a price just because someone hit what you think is a great price can mean you're leaving big $$$ on the table.  \n\nI sold my first good sized company and the buyer wouldn't pay $1 for a subsidiary, so we spun it out into an independent company that would eventually sell for 100X our original asking price.  Yes, lots of growth happened in the interim, but we didn't know what we had until an auction happened a few years later.\n\nA company is only worth what the owner will sell it for. Who cares if it is valued at $1 or $1 Billion it's what the owner feels he wants to get out if it. If the owner is happy and the buyer is happy the company was neither undervalued or overvalued. This number is 100% up to the owner. When he is in a position such as this were he doesn't need to or particularly want to sell. he holds all the cards.",

Sometimes, M&amp;A inquiries from foreign companies are reconnaissance missions / market sizing.\n\nHaving been in a very similar position in the past, for the first couple of video calls, and until an NDA and Memorandum is being signed -  I would be truthful in regards to ratios of our KPIs but elusive in regards to actual numbers.\n\nNow as a SaaS - the first questions are the obvious ones CAC, ARR/MRR, Churn / Burn and such that you can be very truthful about. I would also be interested in learning growth costs in terms of expenses - and whats driving it - advertising / organic / viral e.t.c\n\nA solid foundation in the above should get the ball rolling. But again, in my humble opinion, prepare your questions for them - what is their model like, how do they grow?, are they in a stagnant growth cycle, are they buying up SaaS to prove growth in users or complimenting their service line?  What are their goals in terms of your teams talent and how are they planning on utilizing your team?  \n\n\nedit: And of course - good luck with call and the rest of this journey!!",

It was a startup I worked for where he the owner sold to a decent size company (1.3 billion valuation), he had other offers from BMC (turned them down bc he knew they would sunset the solution and bye, bye employees).\n\nKeep in mind if you decide to sell, do you care what happens to what you built or are you just looking for the cash out. Many large companies make the purchase for various reasons tech/solution, inroads to customer base (all they want are the channels or customers, ex. to expand product offerings etc. as you know it costs a lot more to acquire new customers vs selling into an existing base), increase of market share, inroads to a new market, verticals etc.. Do you care about what happens to your employees? I have been through a couple acquistions and they come in and look at overlap and than evaluate. In the 2 I have been through after the initial round of review (make cuts) it was 12 months pluswhere they decide additional realignment (one was a startup the other one of the largest FinServ companies in the world, both played out the same way).\n\nVC buying a company has many pitfalls as well, many are doing a portfolio consolidation to build a bigger better offering to resell at a later date etc. The worst I saw was a competitor that got bought by one (they were being stealth as they contacted our company posing as a customer fishing for info how we license, pricing etc. Once they acquired the competitor sweeping changes, the worst was they raised pricing and upset a large % of the customer base. My guess on the play from having been in investment sales, they were trimming the fat/streamlining (could be good, could be bad would need to know the financials). The issue it damaged the brand name short term.\n\nSome food for thought should you entertain them.",

            "comment": "I just went through a year of due diligence and negotiations after a general agreement to get acquired, and when Covid hit, the entire deal fell through because our acquirer was a community college - their speculation budget disappeared overnight when students were sent home. So take very seriously the advice about not putting all your eggs in this basket until the deal is done or you have a legal agreement that requires you to stop fundraising, etc. \n\nI have a slightly different bit of advice, and I'm not a lawyer, so this is not from a legal perspective. It's from a strategic view. I did not agree to sign an NDA, because it was a mutual NDA, and I did not want my hands bound by anything they shared until I knew why the acquisition would be of benefit to them and how they were thinking about going towards an acquisition. So if you can, avoid the NDA in the first couple of conversations and keep it high level general concept. An NDA ties you up for years, and if they have overlapping tech or market - which they likely do - the NDA can become problematic. \n\nAlso - trust your gut. If something feels off, slow down. Fear is not the same as feeling like something isn't quite right. You can push through fear into the unknown by making sure you have the right people by your side - M&amp;A, lawyer, board, etc - but if your gut is sending off warning bells, trust your instincts. In a previous startup my spouse had, the acquiring company lied about their cash resources and revenue and wanted to use their startup as the Hail Mary to save their company. They put in language in the acquisition agreement that allowed them to back out with no penalties and no requirements to repay any monies provided to the startup during the due diligence phase if discovery revealed adverse issues that had not be revealed. They were able to walk away because they listened to their instincts and asked for a deeper dive into the acquirers finances than originally provided. \n\nGood luck!",

He stated that he has always regretted selling Twitch to Amazon, regardless of the $1 billion Amazon had acquired it for, of which a large sum went to him. He wish he had given more time to thinking about it, and not just jumped at the money offered. \n\nSo just to reiterate, even if they offer you a lot, calculate if it is worth it, and if it is indeed what you and your team want.",

Maybe they'll say something off the cuff like a multiple on revenue of X-XX, but likely not even that. You will likely need to share a lot of information with them to get a firm offer from them.\n\nAnd, if you're only interested in an outstanding price, you're going to get multiple offers on the table - which means putting in a lot more work.

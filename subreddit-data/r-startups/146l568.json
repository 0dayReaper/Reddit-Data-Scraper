    "postText": "I just finished my apps prototype, and my next step is to get feedback on ways to improve it.\n\nWhile I\u2019d gladly take any methods that effectively test a figma prototype for feedback, I\u2019m curious if I need to worry about protecting the prototype from theft. This could be something I shouldn\u2019t be worrying about as of yet, but I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry when showing others an almost fully fledged prototype. \n\nIf I do need to be wary of theft, which I understand I might not, I will most likely use NDAs for small feedback sessions for quality feedback\n\nHowever, for getting a larger quantity of feedback to show demand for the app, I feel an NDA would be inefficient compared to other strategies. What other ways can I protect the prototype?\n\nEDIT: I understand that it\u2019s not necessary, thanks for the feedback!",

You're probably already way ahead in terms of execution and that matters ten times more than your business idea itself.\n\nIn short you don't need to protect anything; if your project ends up promising and you're halfway competent you'll end up being the first to market anyway",

The final version of the product uses augmented reality and user personalized algorithms that cost 100k to develop an MVP via freelance. (which is over my personal budget without statistics to support its demand).Thats why most of the effort was dedicated to the prototype to how idea would look and feel to get the better quality and quantity feedback to share with potential investors and partners.",

If they steal your designs, they are stealing bad designs. Not only that, a talented coder might need to spend +1000 hours on your Figma designs, which might turn out to have no business value at all. And even if your design had any business value, you still need to market and sell your idea which is another hundreds of hours. \n\nThere is absolutely no reason why anyone would still your idea. \"Stealing your idea\" is not free for the developers. It cost them a lot of time, at least 2000-3000 hours in total. You need time and dedication to follow through on an idea.",

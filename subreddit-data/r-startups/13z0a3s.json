    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI have an interesting situation. I started working on a startup idea as third co-founder with same amount of equity between all of us. The business idea looks plausible and all of us have good track record of successful exits.\n\nNow the issue is that the main founder doesn't want to be the CEO and want to run the show by having his company as accelerator and he indirectly owns two board positions and half of the equity. The CEO is lame duck and has no say whatsoever.\n\nI am curious if anyone seen this. It's been only 3 weeks I am working on this and looks like we made good progress so far in defining the product and all. We also got first demo ready for launch in a week.\n\nWhat I feel uneasy is that the CEO and me both though have officer positions but we dont have much power. Which is ok if the guy running show was listening to our ideas. I disregarded initially his shutting ideas as possible quicker path to doing something viable and faster. But now I have enough data points to believe that he is just shutting down good or very good product ideas.\n\nMy alternative is to go back to my own project which I was bootstrapping into as an engineer and was feeling lazy to actually sell.\n\nI am curious if anyone has thought on this.",

See you in a month. \n\nNow if you have equal equity to each other and are lame ducks, you\u2019re wasting your time.\n\nIf you succeed: this will be taken as Founder A is a genius and you were wrong \n\nIf you fail: this is because Founder A had two lame ducks as Co-founders.",

If you all have equal ownership, you and the other C-level can reshuffle it if you are displeased with the current members.\n\nThe board members serve the company as much as the CEO does - which is why you can have other people in there which you think offer sage advice even if they have no ownership.\n\nThis goes in the other direction too - everyone who is an owner does not also automatically get a seat at the board. In fact it seems incredibly odd to say that a person and their company would be two different board members.\n\nAlso if you are really saying that one person has two seats and there are two more, typically in a split vote, the chair would decide - so if that is one of you two, effectively you get the same results as one seat each, other than for supermajority decisions.\n\nI think it sounds like maybe you just need to discuss with this other person whether the goal is to be equal owners and to raise your concerns. Maybe they are not thinking of this as having the consequences that you do.",

And how do you manage micromanagement in the long term? ...\n\nI would recommend to take some personal time and be really honest with yourself, first thing is if you can handle it without destroying your health. If yes, than you can start to think about risk / benefit analysis.\n\nBtw. I personally would be quite upset, frustrates me to the bone when people do not listen. But my triggers are quite irrelevant to your problem:-).",

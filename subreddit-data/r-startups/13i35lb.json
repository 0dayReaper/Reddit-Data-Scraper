Or, did you think of a great idea that you were so passionate about that you decided to turn it into a business?",

When my employees started getting married and having their first children, I was blown away by how rewarding it was to be providing a work environment that supported these life milestones. I added 401k, 6 weeks of vacation time, and many other benefits because I realized that the reason I started a company was to provide a rewarding job with the most excellent benefits for my employees. It also helped me understand that of the three stakeholders, my investors, my customers, and my employees, I ranked the employees at the top. This is now one of my requirements for any future co-founder.",

Just after it finished, I needed to prep for an interview in which they wanted me to present a case study of my own and the idea just sort of...came to me in the early hours that morning. I think I was primed for that sort of thinking because of the course I took, but it took hold of me and I've been completely consumed by the idea over the past several weeks. \n\nI've got some really solid ideas that I think are wanted, needed, unique, and feasible in this market. In all of my spare time lately, I've been doing market research, user research, learning more about user experience design, and coming up with a sitemap, features list, user personas, and business plan. I already have the product owner experience in the software development world, and the industry itself is one that I've been heavily involved in and passionate about since I was a little kid. \n\nI never really thought of myself as an entrepreneur before now, but I'm really enjoying the whole process. I figure that even if it never ends up being successful, I've learned a shit ton along the way. \n\nI'm not going to make it my full-time gig anytime soon, but thankfully I've got a job offer and a lot of savings in the meantime. \n\nI really like the idea of being my own boss though, being confident enough with myself and my ideas to do something like this, how much it could help this industry I'm so passionate about. The thought of potentially launching a business juggernaut is pretty exciting too.",

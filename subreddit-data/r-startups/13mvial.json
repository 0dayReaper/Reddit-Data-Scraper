    "postText": "I just wanted to share a little reminder that talking to customers is absolutely crucial for the success of your venture. As a founder, it's one of the most important things you can do. Trust me, you can't avoid it if you want to build something great.\n\nIt can be \\*insanely\\* nerve-wracking to approach your first customer. The fear of flopping is real, and it's okay to stumble initially. We've all been there. But here's the thing: you have to keep practicing, keep engaging with customers, and keep refining your communication skills.\n\nBelieve me when I say that it took me a good six months of full-time dedication just to get comfortable with talking to customers. It's a learning curve, and it takes time. But it's worth every moment because talking to customers is how you improve your product.\n\nBy engaging with your customers, you gain invaluable insights and feedback that you simply can't get anywhere else. It's the fastest way to iterate on your product and make it better. Trust me, your customers will have suggestions, pain points, and ideas.\n\nI get it, as founders, we often get caught up in the excitement of building and refining our product. But remember, it's the customers who will ultimately determine its success. So, make talking to them a priority. Dedicate time, energy, and resources to customer conversations, because it's a direct path to product improvement.\n\nNow, I'm not saying it's easy. It can be challenging, especially at first. But trust me, it's worth every ounce of effort you put into it. So, if you're a startup founder and you're not already engaging with your customers, start today. Embrace the nerves, the flops, and the learning curves. Go talk to customers.",

That made it easy because it reduced some of the need to transfer the information. Having said that, my partner, our CTO and backend engineer wasn't in front of customers as often and thus I did have to relay many things to him. He pushed back when needed but overall put his trust in me as the one on the front lines with customers and thus the one with the most insight.\n\nSince I had strong customer relationships from my sales role, I could literally text or call a client whenever I wanted with a product idea or mockup and get feedback quickly. I could also show ideas to prospective clients during sales demos. (This is typically frowned upon in more mature organizations but I think it works well at early stage)\n\nI also categorized our clients by their business types and product needs so I knew which ones to go to for feedback on which features.",

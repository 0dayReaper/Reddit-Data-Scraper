Act in a mature manner. This is meant to be a safe place to support emotional and physical health and there is a zero tolerance policy in effect. Be kind.

It will take 60 days for us to transfer the domain since it is a new domain.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"WTF? Why didn't you tell me that I had to buy separate hosting before I bought the domain? Why didn't you tell me about this 60 day waiting period? I can't wait 60 days to build the website. Cancel the new hosting and just put it back where it was.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Yes sir.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"OK, it's several days later, why can't I use my website?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"It's still in transfer sir.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"No, the transfer was rejected because the domain was too new, now it's back under the old account, why can't I use it?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"I'm very sorry sir, please wait a few more days.\"\n\nPlus, I'm looking for a day job as a backup, but despite everybody saying this is a great job market, my resumes are getting ignored.\n\nI swear, there needs to be something like \"Manpower\"/ day labor for office work, where you just show up in khakis and a polo, do whatever needs to be done, and get paid at the end of the day. Like temping, but less gatekeeping and even more transactional.\n\nMaybe that's the new business right there.",

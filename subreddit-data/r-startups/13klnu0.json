    "postText": "Not sure if this is the right community to ask this. My SO has been at a tech startup for the past few years as cto and only now is the founder finally offering him any equity. He\u2019s offering 9% but asking my SO to take a $200k pay cut per year in exchange for that ownership. So essentially, my SO would take home the same salary as the founder, but for only 8%, while the founder still owns the entire rest of the company since they have no investors. \n\nThey\u2019re pre-IPO, pre- any raise since they had some large contracts that are funding the operation. From my understanding, they plan to do a VC raise perhaps next year. I don\u2019t even think the founder has a valuation in mind. I believe the founder also wants to exit in the next 3-5 years, assuming the company doesn\u2019t go under in the next make-it-or-break-it year.\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out what to have in mind in deciding if this risk is worth it and if the deal is even fair. To be clear, my SO led the team to build their entire product so without him, it\u2019s very unlikely they would have gotten this far. For this reason, I feel that he should ask for his ownership to be immediately vested (yes, I know it\u2019s now awkward because he should have tried to negotiate equity from the start). \n\nI also truly believe the cofounder can afford to pay him more in addition to the equity, because they basically pay anyone who joins whatever ridiculous salary they request. \nIt almost feels like the huge pay cut is a punishment for pushing to get % ownership. Or, am I reading too much into this and is that much of a pay cut normal? \n\nBasically just looking for:\n\n1.) guidance on whether this much of a pay cut is normal given the situation, and if he should push back on that\n\n2.) suggestions on what to ensure is in the term sheet to make sure he doesn\u2019t get screwed over should he decide to take the equity\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "First try to value the company based on current revenue and past rate of growth, you can find different methodologies to do this and find benchmarks for the industry on how revenue + growth rate = valuation. This gives you at least some objective point of reference for how much 9% of the company should be worth.\n\n\nThis is lawyer territory for sure, don\u2019t sign or agree to anything without a competent lawyer on your side. With that said some things to consider\u2026\n\n\nOne question is how do the terms of this exchange play out. Is this new reduced salary indefinitely? For a fixed term? As you mentioned how the equity vests is a huge consideration. If there is vesting you definitely want some sort of agreement that entitles you to gain the full salary value for time worked in the event him and the company part ways. You could also push for the salary to bump back up to a certain amount after a funding event.\n\nThis is ultimately a negotiation. 9% for 200k salary reduction is an opening offer. Crunch some numbers and counter. Maybe you can split the difference to help de risk, and get 5% and only take a $100k cut? \n\n\nFor context, 9% is a huge chunk for a company that is this far along, so don\u2019t consider it an insult or punishment. It does show that your SO is highly valued, but its also a business and the cofounder wants to ensure they are getting some immediate tangible benefit for giving away that sort of equity. $200k can hire another key person or a couple of lower level employees to help grow the company even faster. \n\nSo tl;dr\n\n1) calculate and negotiate, take only the cut you are comfortable with and decide how much you want to risk on the company\u2019s future potential success\n\n2) lawyer, lawyer, lawyer. Someone that is highly experienced and knows the ins and out of this space and will comb through all the agreements closely to ensure your SO is protected. Consult with several before settling on one. Come up with a list of \u201cinterview questions\u201d to ask in a consult and a rubric to grade them. Good ones can be around if they were structuring this deal what methods would they use to screw your SO over, things like that.",

Drastically cut salary and the hopes of a round in a year or so? As an early founding dev I wouldnt take less than 10% with a reasonable salary. \n\nStartups are spinning hopes and dreams as leverage. Don\u2019t fall for it. If you have the internal drive to make that kind of commitment because you believe in it and can manage the cut, go for it. But I\u2019d ask for more equity if you are taking a 200k cut. I dunno what you make but most people can\u2019t even take 200k pay cut.",

He was the first employee and built the dev team up and manages and leads them and his ask was 10 and the first offer he got was for sub 5%. This new offer is the counter to that, but it still seems like a huge cut considering how much they pay current and new employees and the generous raises he\u2019s given out.\n\nI think there\u2019s a % cut where I\u2019d say the risk is tolerable but a 60% cut is huge and will impact us.\n\nWe will definitely have a lawyer look at it too but they more I think about it the riskier it seems.",

This was actually a second offer because we rejected the first offer, which was the same pay cut for only &lt;5% ownership.

Definitely trying to be objective and not take it personally like you said; just trying to understand. In an ideal world, I\u2019d want to suggest my SO push back to the pay cut only being a max of 100k, and only for 3 years or something like that where it\u2019s very defined.\n\nI\u2019ll try out some of the calculation suggestions you mentioned! I actually also do some financial modeling for the startup I work for but we have investors who provide valuation estimates so it\u2019s a lot easier to do than for a company like this that has no investors and no board driving it in any direction.\n\nAnd we will DEFINITELY have a lawyer review it thoroughly if it even gets to that point.",

The chances of the company raising money, turning a profit, and getting sold for a sum such that your partner's 8% (which will actually end up being far less after several dilutions) is worth more than he would otherwise earn are astronomically slim. He should join if he's looking for a career break or a hobby, but it's not a sound financial decision.",

I ask because I have an offer to take 5% (pre-funding) of a company that is VERY early stage, in addition to a salary that matches that from my current employment. Feels to me that the equity offer is a bit of a red herring - the chances that it will convert into meaningful payout feels minimal. \n\nTorn between going in hard with a counteroffer where I ask for much more equity (original founder is at 70% after giving my 5%), a significant uplift to pay, or walking away altogether (given the hours will at least double vs my current job).",

I don\u2019t want to give away what it is in case anyone from there reads on here. But you\u2019re right in that it\u2019s a heavy, and potentially low % chance of success, to expand their model into a space that would turn a lot of profit and that would interest VCs in investing. \n\nBut I do agree with you and that\u2019s my worry. $600k over 3 years (assuming that\u2019s the turnaround time the founder is targeting) is a lot of money and the equity could very likely be zero.\n\nMy understanding is that my husband is thinking of taking the offer but if he finds it going downhill in a year, he will leave. This makes the risk $200k and not 600k, and if he backdates the vesting, he\u2019d still get something out of an IPO if the terms are written correctly. \n\nI\u2019m very risk intolerant and feel that the equity isn\u2019t worth foregoing 200k income, given my understanding of their company and how the founder runs it.",

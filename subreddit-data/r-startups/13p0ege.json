I'm curious to know how you generated your business ideas, acquired your initial customers, and validated the problem you were addressing. If you have any advice, suggestions, or potentially valuable startup ideas worth exploring, I would greatly appreciate your input. Thank you in advance for sharing your insights!",

            "comment": "1. How you generated your business ideas - One was with an entrepreneurial friend and another idea came from an industry I was working in for many years. There were two dozen other ideas that I explored at varying lengths that I ultimately took behind the barn to shoot them, and never speak of them again. \n\nThe truth is, most likely, a brilliant idea isn\u2019t going to come to you. You need to build the muscle of identifying problems, thinking through a solution, and validating it. Sometimes that takes a minute and sometimes it takes months to validate. And if you validate you need to keep validating over time. \n\nThe point is, when you\u2019re starting out, come up with ideas and be prepared for them to suck until you find one worth going after. Be comfortable sucking. It\u2019s part of the process.\n\n2. How\u2019d you acquire your first customers? Cold email, networking, cold calling literally hundreds if not thousands of people. That\u2019s part of your validation process. Every outreach you\u2019re validating a need for your solution and your messaging. Keep trying to figure it out. The other thing I do to validate every project now (after it passes the sniff test) is create a landing page to get ppl to sign up. That is a list you can turn into your first customers relatively easily. If you can\u2019t build a list, your product isn\u2019t going to sell (again that\u2019s continuous validation). \n\n3. How did I validate? Step 1 is thinking through it, talking to a couple ppl, and seeing if it\u2019s worth investing time into. If it\u2019s worth it I write a pitch deck to think through it. There\u2019s a newsletter linked in my profile. My last post goes into depth how to validate quickly.\n\n4. Additional advice - do not wait for the right idea. Start doing this with every idea no matter how small. You\u2019ll build the muscle of validation and the muscle of \u201caction\u201d first. There\u2019s a million reasons not to do something and that\u2019s why most ppl never start. Accept that you and your ideas are going to stink for a while. By leaning towards action regardless of the idea you won\u2019t fall trap to the loop of never starting.\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "It seems like you're looking for insights from entrepreneurs who have started their own businesses in vertical industries. As an AI model, I don't have personal experiences or entrepreneurial journeys to share. However, I can provide some general advice and insights based on broad patterns and experiences of successful entrepreneurs.\r  \n\r  \nGenerating Business Ideas: Ideas often come from identifying gaps in the market or experiencing a problem first-hand. Entrepreneurs in vertical industries like manufacturing or agriculture might identify these gaps by working in the industry and recognizing inefficiencies, or through conversations with those who do. They might also spot opportunities for innovation by keeping up-to-date with the latest technology and thinking about how it could be applied in these industries.\r  \n\r  \nAcquiring Initial Customers: Initial customers are often acquired through networking within the industry, offering pilot projects or trials, or through targeted marketing efforts. It's key to identify your target audience and understand their needs, preferences, and behavior. Leveraging personal connections and industry networks can also be very beneficial in the early stages.\r  \n\r  \nValidating the Problem: This usually involves talking to potential customers about their pain points, conducting market research, or even launching a minimum viable product (MVP) to see if it gains traction. The Lean Startup methodology, which emphasizes creating an MVP and then iterating based on customer feedback, can be particularly useful here.\r  \n\r  \nAdvice:\r  \n\r  \nKnow your industry: Deep knowledge of your industry is incredibly valuable. It allows you to identify opportunities others might miss and gives you credibility with customers and investors.\r  \n\r  \nBuild a strong team: The right team can make all the difference. Look for people who share your vision and can bring diverse skills and perspectives to the table.\r  \n\r  \nDon't be afraid to pivot: Many successful startups have had to pivot at some point. If you find that your initial idea isn't working, be willing to adjust and try something new.\r  \n\r  \nNetwork: Building strong relationships with other entrepreneurs, potential customers, and investors can be incredibly valuable. Attend industry events, join online communities, and don't be afraid to ask for introductions.\r  \n\r  \nStay resilient: Starting a business is hard and often involves facing setbacks. The most successful entrepreneurs are those who can stay resilient and keep pushing forward, even when things get tough.\r  \n\r  \nPotential Startup Ideas: There are countless opportunities in vertical industries, especially given the potential for digital transformation in these sectors. For instance, there's a lot of potential in using AI and machine learning to improve efficiency in manufacturing, or using IoT technology to improve yield in agriculture. In construction, there's potential for startups that can improve safety, efficiency, or sustainability.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, the best ideas will come from your own observations and experiences, and the most successful businesses are often those that find a unique niche or untapped opportunity in the market.",

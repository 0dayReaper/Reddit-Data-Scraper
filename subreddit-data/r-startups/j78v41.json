    "postText": "I just saw yet another post for help where the person didn't want to say what their idea is. You've probably all heard that ideas are worthless but I'm going to try and lay out why execution is everything.\n\nI've built a business that has over a million in sales annually but covid has flattened our growth from 300% yoy to 0%. So we need to switch things up. I've got a fantastically talented team, so I worked through every lost sales over 3 years and why, formed a hypothesis about the problem. Thought about it for a while had an idea that seemed to tick the boxes and the team liked it so we started that direction. Then one day the lightening rod hit. I had a great idea how for what we needed to build, it wasn't the mostly generic thing I first came up with, it was new and it was going to be great. \n\nI told the team they thought the idea sucked. I drew pictures and workflows and explained all the rational and I managed to move some people to on the fence. So I just said fuck it and built the prototype myself. The suddenly everybody was like oh this is actually great. \n\nI have a team of people who have been living this problem for 4 years, who are passionate about what they do and super talented, yet they couldn't see all the detail in my head about how to actually make the idea work, so they didn't get it. \n\nThis happens with things big and small. Another one from last week was after my direction, the designer made a design that was a little ambiguous the coder interpreted it wrong and for various reasons the team was convinced that the way it had been done was actually better because it allowed the user more freedom. So much so that it caused quite a dust up. Anyway to keep everyone happy we went with new user testing, they were amazed at how much new users struggled and quit the product with their way and all the alternative the users just glided through. \n\nIt is so hard to get people to fully believe and buy into your vision for a product, it takes constant work to keep course correcting and to figure out what battles are close enough it's not worth fighting. Vision isn't a once off, it's a constant. \n\nAlso the thing is that no matter how novel your idea is you'll probably find that there are competitors. With our first product we didn't do deep competition research, when people saw our product they had never seen anything like it and we thought it was totally new. Turned out that 2 competitors had had the idea 5 years before us. Also turned out that some people liked our execution more, so it wasn't a big deal. \n\nEven with this latest product when we went looking we found competition. Luckily not as well set up as us and their products kind of suck but they had the same core idea. \n\nI've been in the startup game for a while and it seems like even with wholly new things, if there is a set of circumstances in the world that give you the spark of something original and great, that has never existed in the course of humanity, then it probably happened to a few other people and some of those people probably have access to lots of cash. \n\nExecution is so key, Google wasn't the first search engine, Facebook wasn't the first social media platform. You don't need to be the first or the richest but you need to realise that you're in a race from the outset and execute to make something that some people love. \n\nIf I can take everything of value you have to offer a company from one post, then you had nothing of value.\n\nEdit: The point is not that ideas are totally worthless, a vision is more than an idea, it's a lot of ideas and decisions, communication, leadership BUT people scared to share a one reddit post's worth of information on their concept when asking for help. They have nothing of value to lose by sharing and in fact people can't help them effectively unless they tell them their idea.\n\nEdit 2: People complaining about me not sharing my idea. It's all over my post history:\n\nMy company makes enterprise grade, high performing machine learning easy.\n\nWe automate a lot of the work a data scientist would do manually and do it to a a very high level of quality automatically. It's a development tool, so it's cross industry. \n\nFeel free to take that idea and make a company. You have my blessing.\n\nEdit 3: I'm not saying the people with the ideas have no value, I'm saying that it actually takes a lot of hard work and time to fully communicate your vision, so the value of an idea by itself as would be communicated in a reddit post has no value, without the person who had the idea there to keep filling in the blanks.",

At least that's been my experience.\n\nFor example: I was talking to a friend and he said he was thinking of building an app that does X. That's literally all he said. One sentence, not diving into any details. Since he meanwhile abandoned the idea, I took it and decided to dig deeper and now I'm in the process of putting it all together and deciding of what an MVP would look like. My vision about the idea is most likely not the same with my friend's vision, but that's all I needed: the idea. Again, that's just my experience, maybe I'm in the minority on this one, but I think some people just need a good idea, that spark, you know?",

You don't know what you're executing on unless your product team actually does research as to what problem to solve. I will agree with you that most ideas suck- but that's because most people focus on the solution (output) rather than the problem they're trying to actually solve (outcome.)   \n\n\nThink of it this way.. a classic example is someone having an idea to simply change all buttons to 'blue' in an app. That's a terrible idea without basis. However, if you're looking at a problem to solve around accessibility, you start to understand that perhaps the buttons being blue is but one output of of a larger outcome, and a legit problem to solve.  That said, it doesn't mean it is the right problem to solve, and you still need to understand your customer insights and furthermore, what objectives you're looking to impact (and why.) This is everything your product manager is for. \n\nNow on to your own experience..\n\n*\"Then one day the lightening rod hit. I had a great idea how for what we needed to build, it wasn't the mostly generic thing I first came up with, it was new and it was going to be great.\"*\n\nSo basically... you came up with an idea, didn't validate it whatsoever with anyone, and then blamed your team for thinking it sucked. This sounds like a classic HIPPO situation. You're the person with the highest paid and simply decided everyone else should accept what you said.\\\\\n\n*\"Another one from last week was after my direction, the designer made a design that was a little ambiguous the coder interpreted it wrong and for various reasons the team was convinced that the way it had been done was actually better because it allowed the user more freedom. So much so that it caused quite a dust up\"*\n\nYou know how you avoid these issues? With a proper discovery process. A discovery process includes coming up with an idea, understanding what problem to solve, creating initial prototypes, validating that with customers, then building a new prototype based on that, then asking your team to create it. You don't just build something based on your own bias because *you* think it's great.\n\n*I have a team of people who have been living this problem for 4 years, who are passionate about what they do and super talented, yet they couldn't see all the detail in my head about how to actually make the idea work, so they didn't get it.*\n\nDo you expect people to be mind readers? Did you at any point share your vision through a canvas or document of any sort that outlined the problem you aiming to solve, the vision, mission and outline details about how you compare to other possible competitors? People aren't mind readers, so don't expect them to just know what's in your head. Again, this is part of the strategy process your product manager helps set.\n\n*It is so hard to get people to fully believe and buy into your vision for a product, it takes constant work to keep course correcting and to figure out what battles are close enough it's not worth fighting. Vision isn't a once off, it's a constant.*\n\nYASSSSS. This right here. This is important. You need to continue validating your vision and iterating on it to ensure you're building the right product and solving the right problems.\n\n*Execution is so key, Google wasn't the first search engine, Facebook wasn't the first social media platform*\n\nCorrect, but these companies do what they do well because they have a solid vision. It's not about the output, it's about the outcome. Set a solid vision, share it with your team, have a product roadmap that outlines what problems you want to solve and make sure you have a proper discovery process. You're lacking some basic product management skills that would've helped you avoid all of these issues.\n\nExecution is important yes, but there's a reason strategy comes before that. Strategy helps you understand what, why, and for whom you're building things for. Execution is simply how that is implemented.",

I am a product manager and have been at several companies. \n\nThe fastest way for you to fail and collect tech debt is to run 0 discovery. Discovery is an important process as it allows you to validate that you're building something the market requires, you're solving an actual problem, and that people actually want to pay you for it.\n\nYes, you can absolutely build a product for yourself, but just because something solves **your** problem doesn't mean it will solve **other people's** problem. There's a huge difference in that. The latter is what makes you money, and again, this is why you should run research.  \n\nYou say on your second point \"taking something proven to have a product market fit\" - how did you get to that assumption? Did you actually do any research, or are you taking someone else's validation and then creating your own product based on that? Again, the second is a dangerous way to go as it's likely that company has a solid vision and mission set out. (This is why competitors that try to build stuff just cause you have it tend to fail miserably.)  \n\n&gt; Asking people what they want is mostly useless. \n\nI never said you should ask them what they want. Users don't know what they want, all they know is that they have a problem. \n\n**What you should be doing** \nAsk users what problems they are having. Understand above all what problem they have and then figure out based on all that feedback you collect how to actually solve it. \n\nIn regards to data: There is a huge difference between being data-informed and data-driven. If you let data drive you, you'll be missing out on a lot of context. Being data-informed is a lot more beneficial, as data should always be taken with context. You then have the power and the foresight to make decisions based on your own knowledge of the industry, your customers, validated feedback, all alongside that data.\n\nAlso your assumption that I do not have a successful product is inaccurate.

If your designers and developers aren't grasping what you're saying, it's because you need to involve them in understand what the vision is, explain and validate the problems you are trying to solve, and then run discovery and experimentation so that you can build the best version of your product. This is why there are several frameworks in existence that include this, from XP to Dual Track to Design Thinking. They all involve quick, iterative processes that allow you to understand the strategy prior to building things.",

Let me approach from, or put that in another way: Momentum is powerful, but friction is stronger and more persistent. And, sometimes your product, package, performance, presentation, et al. gets stuck in the mud.\n\nLet me put this a different way still: let's say  your execution is flawless, but then Donald Trump puts what you did in a tweet, and all of the sudden attention and sales change for the worst on a dime; worse yet, fired, because your 'other boss' (or client) saw what you did on the internet without their permission. This is only a weak example, but a relatable one still.\n\nMore generally, it means sometimes theres only so much you can do other than change your 'location, location, location' before you execute anything.\n\nIf you understand the world of computing then I hope you understand what i'm saying. Sometimes you can't support everything, or sometimes 'the wheel' or 'the fire', something other people invent or discover, work on certain machine, or certain locations. Point being, you should know exactly what I mean by environment: sometimes some things don't play nice, if at all, with each other.\n\nThere is no perfect software. It has no final form. It must conform and play nice with every last unpredictable thing to its environment in which it executes. And, perhaps, math is merely something highly reconstitute-able, rather than the truth itself.\n\nAlso, think of it like being a good parent. Can you really prevent your child from taking drugs on your execution alone? I don't think I'd agree with, let alone trust the person (with other subject matter) who said they could.\n\nI mean, being the person who takes on all the risk is one thing to respect. Being the person 'who gets it done' can be equivocal, especially if all it takes is passing along a word or name to someone else to trigger what needs to be triggered.",

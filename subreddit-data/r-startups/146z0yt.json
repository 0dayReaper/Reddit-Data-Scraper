    "postText": "Hello everyone \n\nI am looking at setting up supplier contracts but not sure I go about it. \n\nI have found suppliers for all of the parts I need for my business and have tested them out etc\u2026 \n\nWhat I am wondering is how can I set up a contract to pay (for example) 20% deposit on a larger order and then pay off the rest after some time or something similar. \n\nBasically I don\u2019t have the capital to buy all of the stock I need straight away. \n\nI have a client ready to purchase and was thinking of asking them for a deposit once the order is placed but once again not sure if there is a standard to try and stick to. \n\nJust looking for some advice, is there a standard process to follow or is it just asking the suppliers bluntly for such a deal? \n\nThank you",

            "comment": "Generally suppliers will work on a deposit basis, your minimum order size might be a bit high and they may ask for a letter of credit to cover the rest\n\nIf you already have a client willing to buy then look into purchase order finance combined with invoice financing to cover your cash flow issues\n\nThere are plenty of alternative lenders (ie not banks) that will do this for you if your paperwork stacks up\n\nFor more info:\n\nhttps://www.tradefinanceglobal.com/invoice-finance/purchase-order-finance/",

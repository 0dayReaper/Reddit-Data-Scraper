Honestly, it has mostly been a waste of time so far. \n\nI've observed the following:\n\n* Most people either are not seriously interested in committing to something, or have a predetermined idea (and maybe already working on it) but want you to jump and start doing stuff they tell you to do.\n* Almost nobody is willing to spend some time doing a sample project to see if the two of you are compatible in terms of skills and working \"personalities\".\n* Most people are super full of themselves and feel like they are the next Altman. Lack of self-awareness and/or a bit of humbleness to try to see the other's perspective.\n\nAt this point I'm wondering if I should stop wasting my time meeting random people and if anybody was successful in fidning a partner in such platforms.\n\nIf you had a positive experience with it, can you share some tips on how to go about it?\n\nThanks",

That goes for not just cofounders, but any hire at a startup.\n\nBut there are qualified people who want to be involved with startups that aren't necessarily FAANG material, or who simply want more ownership.\n\nAnd the same for founders, not all founders are superstars in the eyes of YC or by typical standards. That doesn't mean they can't create viable businesses and don't need to find someone to join them.\n\nIt sort of sounds like the YC marketplace is a touch broken. And many people looking for cofounders are doing a poor job of bringing something to the table worth considering as well.",

I kept trying to tell him that we needed to have some steak first before we got hung up on the sizzle of ai.  I wrote some stuff to demo over the course of a few days, and he just ignored it.  Everyone seems to want to jam ai into something right now.

It was that classic adage of when \u201cpreparation and opportunity meet.\u201d I believed it might work out and put that effort into my profile. And like dating, we can only control ~50% of this situation.\n\nThe cofounder I found had to complete the other 50%. They are excited, engaged, have an idea I aligned with, we share values, and the technical skills in our respective backgrounds make us confident in the partnership. \n\nWe met up in person, I did an exercise, I called his previous employees\u2026 we wouldn\u2019t want to engage with a cofounder who didn\u2019t do due diligence. Without a company started, you can only vet people for who they are and what their potential may be. If matches aren\u2019t willing to be that engaged, I question if they\u2019re ready for you.\n\nLastly, on \u201cfull of themselves\u201d issue\u2014I see this a lot, even beyond the YC platform. Some are are high on their own supply, because they haven\u2019t hit real world constraints yet. Others know how hard the constraints are and have to prepare for battle by bolstering their self confidence. Either way\u2014getting down to business and talking through the problem you want to solve and how you can solve it should help peel back the egos.\n\nHope this helps.",

It sounds nice that there\u2019s someone to help out with things but the reality is that the same person will also bring along other kinds of burden. \n\nUnless it\u2019s a person you known for a long time already and have a positive relationship with, starting a company with someone you\u2019ve just met isn\u2019t going to last. \n\nYC sells the do a project together as the fix to find a fit but building a company together has far more at stake (emotionally, financially, mentally, morally, etc), than a test project.",

I think it speaks to the community though and the path we took was very similar.\n\nI was building my thing, he was building the early days of Deft. I did some work on his project and he did some work for mine. We enjoyed working together and I eventually shut my thing down to go all-in on Deft because I saw the vision for my own project encapsulated in his. \n\nLike any good relationship, it takes some compromise and sacrifice. Founders often have strong opinions and visions which makes that even more difficult. I'd argue that finding the right person to build a company with is more important than the idea so it makes sense that it takes a lot of time and effort.",

Most are probably not the right cofounder for me, but a cofounder relationship is like marriage and you are going to be spending every day with this person for years. I went into the YC cofounder matching site wanting to understand more about what I wanted in a cofounder relationship and every test project has taught me something. So far I haven't met the right person, but I think by knowing more about what I do want, when the right person is there, I'll be able to identify it.",

Have a few good chat and find potential cofounder on my idea. But maybe it\u2019s because I am the tech founder and already built my mvp, so it\u2019s easier to get attention. Otherwise, just keep chatting with idea doesn\u2019t help in term of business dating. Time is valuable to everyone on the platform\u2026",

    "postText": "Hello all, hoping to find some help here. \nI apologize for any mistakes I make in advance, as I have a 5 month old baby and the early morning hours are the only time I get to work!\n\n\nCurrently in the VR/AR development space. As an offshoot of our main company and to niche down I would like to start building out AR experiences for influencers as a way to drive Engagement and increase viewership/influencership (if there is such a word)\n\nSo things such as AR makeup filters, travel filters, AR shoe try-on, real time polls etc \n\nMy question is for those who have a background/experience in marketing and sales:\n\n1. What level of influencers should I be seeking (example micro/Mid influencers)\n\n2. What should their engagement rates be ?\n\n3. Should I be seeking out only influencers who sell their products or it doesn\u2019t matter \n\nI assume that An influencer is who is actively looking to increase their follower count and engagement rate will be our ideal customer rather than someone who has already made it and gets huge sponsorships\n\n\nThank you for the help!",

            "comment": "I own an AR company and have sold the same thing. Big influencers don\u2019t care and the social platforms offer to make them their own filters anyway with their in house teams, yet you still rarely see them used like Loren Grey\u2019s on Snapchat. \n\nThe smallest influencers are the most open to buying one branded with themselves cuz it gives them a sort of proof they are popular. But they will want to pay $50 and not a dime more. \n\nMiddle influencers require a lot of convincing. \n\nAny of them with products or businesses just treat like any other brand really. David Dobrik never really asked for his own filter even though he\u2019s so connected with snap\u2026 til he built a pizza place that has them now. \n\nSo in my opinion, the only ones likely to pay you enough to make it worth it are gonna have products to sell and should be your main focus. You could look for some very niche influencers who already leverage effects to potentially sell them on filters just for themself, as it helps make their content. But outside that, the money and desire is quite low",

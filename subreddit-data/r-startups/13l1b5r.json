Any other founders have resources on how they made their first sales or first beta users ? It seems like a tough industry to crack with people generally not wanting to change their processes. \n\nIf cold emailing, who should I target my cold email towards? Procurement or CFO ?",

Start by offering a free trial or pilot program to make it less risky for them to test your solution. Also, focus on targeting small to medium-sized businesses, as larger corporations could be more resistant to change. Word of mouth could also play a major role in this industry, so getting some good feedback initially could help spread the word. Best of luck!",

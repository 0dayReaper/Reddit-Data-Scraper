According to interest, we have Canadian English and French. We already know we want UK English, US English, French (France), and there seems to be interest for a German version. Translating to another language is a few hours and $500CDN.\n   * **Ways to improve gender-neutrality.** This is a horrible stomper for us.

We also saw that Facebook/Insta/Twitter all like to ban people even on accident and offer no real support. Lastly we don't like how Instagram has become super complex with all the features like Reels, and e-commerce, other platforms like Vero are also bad offering a huge list of features and trying to be a combination. We offer a clean and simple interface, the only features we have are designed to give more reach. We are currently in [beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/EkjqtxFC) technically it's an alpha haha. I'm one of cofounders and the CEO.\n\nGoals: The goal for this month is to get more users and grow our community, you can help by joining the beta and sharing with your friends. The long term goal is to help people get the recognition they deserve on social media, anyone with great content can get big, you don't have to be a celebrity or be big on other socials, you just need to provide great content.\n\nWhat do you get: You will get a limited edition early adopter verification badge upon our release that will increase your account authority.

Our website features a cannabis conversion tool that allows users to estimate the amount of time a purchased product will last. Additionally, the gravity ledger team produces content and cultivates the latest cannabis news.\n\nThe Gravity Ledger has released its long-awaited journal design for crowdfunding supporters and early site visitors. Our company has just expanded into guided journaling an exploding new sector in the cannabis industry. We are capping off a transition period with the release of our new site design, our cannabis journal, and soon, our downloadable application for Android or iOS.\n\nThe Gravity Ledger has flown well under the radar and is now thrilled to introduce itself to the cannabis community. We are now offering our first supporters exclusive access to a limited number of first-run journals, months before they hit store shelves.\n\nWhat makes our journal different is the simple infective entry system and powers users to effortlessly record each session in just minutes. Consumers can track their favorite strains, shops, and products with ease. One of the most efficient cannabis journals on the market, the Gravity Ledger journal is designed for the genuine cannabis consumer.\n\n**What life cycle stage is your startup at?**\n\n2- We are validating our products, beta-testing our application, and beginning to engage in networking to build B2B relationships. We are trying to promote our social media accounts and have been actively sharing cannabis-related news for 6+ months. Our website is still going through updates, but we have the MVP(s) in place. We have just launched a crowdfunding campaign on IndieGogo and are taking any advice on how best to spread the word.\n\n**Your role?** I am the Founder.\n\n**What goals are you trying to reach this month?**\n\nOur first priority is increasing awareness of our brand and website. Additionally, we are raising capital to have our products printed and shipped internationally. Then we are planning on joining the conference circuit (Cannacon, Lucky Leaf, etc.) this fall and winter to directly promote our print products, downloadable application, and website.\n\nOur application will include a newsfeed, strain buyer tool, stock ticker, and our conversion calculator to begin with. To begin with, we are launching a beta version of our application in May/June and will start allowing users to experience it. We hope to release an expanded version with more features in the late fall.  After crowdfunding, we plan to begin a seed-funding round with investors to further develop and broadly promote all of our products.\n\n**How could** r/startups **help?**\n\nFirst, we are open to any and all advice that you are willing to offer. Any feedback on our product would be incredibly helpful since we are still in development. Also, we would be incredibly thankful if anyone was willing to share our website or crowdfunding page. We definitely need help networking. I would like to make some great connections and get some advice on moving forward.\n\nOn a more personal note, this is the hardest part for me as an introvert, and I have been incredibly thankful for the rest of my team for handling a lot of the outreach thus far. As a longtime lurker on many subreddits, I am now finding it is more necessary than ever to reach out to my community. I can\u2019t wait to hear what you guys have to say about what we are doing.\n\n**Discount for** r/startup **subscribers?**\n\nAnyone who purchases their journal through the IndieGoGo perk program will be able to get 10-20% off. Currently, on our site, our journal is only available for pre-order, but once released we will announce an r/startups discount code for this sub.",

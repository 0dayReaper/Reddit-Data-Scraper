Our monetization strategy is paid mobile application - one time payment, and you can use the app as long as you want.

Work, studying, planning, travel, even grocery shopping. But there was always one problem with them, the time they took to get facilitated and afterwards, exported into genuine tasks and goals, so I started looking for online solutions. I thought if there is an online solution for everything, why not find one for this. After trying out a few different brainstorming tools, I was not truly satisfied with what I was being offered inside these tools and sessions, their features were limited and did not make my experience better, nor did they save a big chunk of time, so I decided to develop my own brainstorming tool, and I'm here today, to present you my new brainstorming tool and get your ideas and opinion on it, as well as to help anyone else who is in the shoes I was a few years ago.\n\nFeedback Requested: What do you all think about facilitating brainstorming sessions online? Have you tried it, do you like it?\n\nCheck it out and feel free to write anything in the comments section bellow, I will be reading it all!",

It looks like an amazing side project for a portfolio but I'm not sure about it's viability as a startup idea. \n\nIt doesn't seem to address a particularly urgent need but one that is shared across many teams. The need for a collaborative space for writing out ideas during a brainstorm is already met at most companies through whiteboards in their videoconferencing software with all of the features from the premium plan.\n\nIt seems like something that one team could use without a wider company adoption or approval similarly to https://www.scrumpoker-online.org/en/",

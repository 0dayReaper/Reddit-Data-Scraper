How did you find your current customers, how do they purchase, do you pick and pack or use a company, what's the benefits to a customer over buying from a shop etc. (The more detail the better). \n\nAlso, can you explain your thought process behind wanting to grow your subscription service and open a pet shop. One is very different from the other and I'm confused as to why you would want to run two businesses when you are only just now starting one.",

            "comment": "Focus on customer satisfaction: Since you already have a few regular customers, make sure to provide exceptional service and quality products. Word-of-mouth recommendations can go a long way in attracting new customers.  \nExpand your reach: Consider utilizing social media platforms to showcase your products, engage with pet owners, and run targeted advertising campaigns. Building an online presence can help you reach a wider audience and potentially increase sales.  \nCollaborate with other pet-related businesses: Partnering with local groomers, trainers, or pet daycare centers can provide cross-promotion opportunities. You can offer special discounts or bundle deals to customers who use your services in combination with those of your partners.  \nif you really want to get out there reach out to [https://www.theventurecanyon.com/](https://www.theventurecanyon.com/) and get your startup featured on their newsletter",

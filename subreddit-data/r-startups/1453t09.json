    "postText": "Hi there. We are launching a project related to the construction of houses printed on a 3D printer (100% environmentally friendly and reliable). I would like to ask for help. We are just gaining momentum and are actively looking for our first customers, partners. I do not want to be another company that sends spam or something like that. Therefore, I want to know, perhaps there is someone who understands this area to help find the first customers or become a partner? (Of course not for free). \r  \nOr can you share your experiences as you got the first customers in your project. I will be very grateful!",

Everyone in this niche profession has the same problem which I know all too well from having experienced it for \\~10 years. We launched our SaaS into my network on LinkedIn with some tongue-in-cheek video animations (all cheaply hacked together with AI tools) making fun of people in my very niche profession that only someone who had had that niche problem would understand. We opted for a limited free-trial launch and did the whole \"comment below for a free trial\" on the initial LinkedIn post. The videos spread really well with very little effort from our part and a nice number of those trial users converted to paying users when the free trial ended.\n\nIn our case it really helped being in a niche profession that I know inside out and have an extensive network in that I could sell into. Maybe you need to bring somone on board who has that in the house building/property development sector?",

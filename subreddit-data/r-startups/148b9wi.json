    "postText": "Is this even viable business model? E.g approach sme businesses and offer if they want to have customised mobile app. During the process an MVP is already available and I just sell it to them. \n\nThe target market are sme businesses that doesn't have app but only have rudimentary website where customers still have to call to get quotes or product information etc. \n\nJust would like to hear your thoughts. I guess this is basically not a startup idea more like dev shop offering potential clients an app that's already customised to their business?\n\nUpdate with specific example: an app for car finance company. The competitors already have their own mobile apps but this company doesn't. The app is only responsible in MVP for taking inquiries, registration and getting credit score before the company need to handle it on their own.",

I also know a company that provides white-label APIs for banks and they've been very successful. \n\nThis isn't a model that can become huge, but it can be quite profitable and much less likely to fail, as long as you validate that there is such a need on the market.\n\nThe big challenge that you're probably going to face is that at some point these companies will want to customize the app in different ways, so you need to set up your technical infrastructure in a way that allows you to keep a default set of features + a variety of customization trees. So, you need to think of it from the beginning.",

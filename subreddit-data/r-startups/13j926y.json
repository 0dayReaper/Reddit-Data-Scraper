    "postText": "I\u2019m a 2nd potential employee of a start up and the type of equity that\u2019s being offered is a shares priced at pre-funded value.  The argument being that yes, I would be paying for the stock out of my own pocket but the value after being funded would be x10. (This transaction would happen directly before being funded.) Have the possible equity options this is beneficial for me due to taxes.\n\nPersonally I know next to nothing about startup equity.  I don\u2019t like the idea of pulling money out of my pocket to pay into a startup.  I feel like my risk is taking a demanding job at a lower than market salary.  \n\nIs there a primer for the various types of startup equity w/ pros and cons?  I would appreciate any resources.",

            "comment": "It seems like this is primarily for tax purposes, because a direct stock grant would be taxable upon vesting and would be at the higher valuation. Consult a lawyer but I would see if the company can give you an interest free loan that covers the purchase price of the shares\u2026 and then structure it so the loan doesn\u2019t have to be paid back until those shares are sold. Essentially no change to the companies cash position but you get your shares for joining at the pre-funding valuation. The question for me from the company perspective is if there is a way to protect itself from you leaving right after a few months and retaining those shares. But I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some way to structure a synthetic vesting agreement in conjunction with the loan so the shares can be reclaimed or bought back at a discount to reflect the pre-funding value.",

            "comment": "These are stock options correct? You won\u2019t vest immediately typical is a 4 year grant with one year cliff.  \n\nI hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you need to start with the assumption your options are worthless. And if you are super lucky they will be worth something in 5-10 years. And you won\u2019t really need to buy your options until you leave or there is an exit event. \n\nWorrying about the tax liability is the least of your worries. You only have to pay taxes when you exercise your options. And it is pointless to exercise most options. \n\nDon\u2019t think of these as a sure thing. They are a lottery ticket. May the odds be in your favor, but they probably aren\u2019t. And certainly not anytime in the near term.",

I don't have a specific API in mind, but have been playing with the idea of integrating all my domains, DNS and hosting under one platform that I can control from a single admin panel.\n\nSome of the services I currently use don't have a public API, but Google AppEngine (hosting), DigitalOcean (hosting), DurableDns (DNS) and Namecheap (domains) all have APIs that could be tied together into a really neat product. Maybe even something saleable.\n\nI signed up, and will check out the developer area first (well, second) thing tomorrow morning.\n\nIf I build a private app for, say, GAE or Namecheap, can that app still be made public later, or would I have to make that decision first and go through the approval process?\n\n\nedit:\n\nHow cool would it be to register a domain, point its DNS to AppEngine, create a Google Cloud database for it and set up a basic site with one text message! I'm so excited :)",

Tread carefully.\"\n\nWhat more information could you want/need? The help, tos, privacy, and security page answers most common questions about the service. The idea behind Mailstache.io is that it's making email management easy as pie. We offer multiple ways to contact us and are willing to answer and any questions one might have about the service. We take security very very seriously and are even dedicated to educating the public on the topic security practices. Surely a comment that doesn't need to be attached to the end of the listing.\n\nI've updated the frontpage to better display what the service is for.",

It's been published.\nWe have a novel miniature FULLY active RFID circuit that is programmable as a controller, tag, or our own area tag. Very smart, very configurable, works with any sensor. It can locate, authorize (eg. a USB with a given computer), control (turn lights or anything other switch on/off), and track. It's for data security but is a platform, so it was a nightmare to get the first-in-field patent together to cover everything. My favorite part is preventing/finding missing persons, however (and also pets) because you set up a range for any tag and the controller (which we have in one prototype within an actual finger ring) alerts when the tagged item gets too close to the set distance. It is just unbelievable that for missing persons we have no better technology than primitive looking for, calling out, looking around some more. We're also military+ grade encrypted, unhackable, and have inaccessible software.\nThanks for your interest!",

Even if you caught something and replayed it, nothing would happen. The software is inaccessible--you can't read it out, and even we can't alter it once it's on-board. We won a 50,000 euro award in a German contest that helped us get started but it has been a *long* haul. We've done some presentations and gotten good feedback--thanks for yours, you know you get jaded and burned out working on stuff for so long--but we just need to get more visibility at this point.\nAlso, our tags are smart--they can be configured to respond in a lot of ways under various conditions. They also link as arrays and work indoors or out, so you could have your own invisible perimeter. It self-monitors, has a special battery protocol, doesn't need GPS to track (even the Dept of Defense is leaving GPS behind, since it can be jammed), and the tags can alert if they are tampered with or even if they are touched. We're also very tiny and easy to disguise.\nThanks for the kind words!",

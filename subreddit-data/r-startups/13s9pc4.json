    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nForgive me if this isn\u2019t the best place to ask this question, if anyone knows a better subreddit please let me know as I couldn\u2019t figure out which crypto-focused one would be best.\n\nI am a former technical project manager retraining as an AI/ML engineer. My business partner is a crypto forensic accountant. \n\nI believe we\u2019ve identified a huge gap in the market that can be addressed through tokenisation, we\u2019ve got a plan to seek venture capital as well as launch an ICO this year. \n\nI\u2019ve been conducting a literature review on ICO success, one thing I\u2019ve seen is that to build trust without having your IP stolen you can go to a third party ICO reviewer who voluntarily rate your startup for potential investors to get a clean picture of your trustworthiness, does anyone have more info on this or where to look / which companies or sites do this? Thank you.",

            "comment": "Why would you seek VC  AND conduct an ICO? Usually, it's one or the other. Regardless, the question is about building trust with potential investors without having your IP stolen. Usually, crypto companies build trust by open-sourcing some of their IP. Is your (combined) reputation worth anything? Personally, a third-party stamp that says founders are legit would mean very little to me - a public track record speaks much more. Are you trying to launch this anonymously?",

While we\u2019re not going to do it anonymously, as young men our reputations don\u2019t necessarily proceed us, hence the need to bring these specific people and their contacts on board (very confident this will happen). In other words, we\u2019re doing things a little different than perhaps other crypto startups by virtue of our situation and opportunities. \n\nThank you for your feedback, we have an ambitious plan in mind that involves aggressively taking a large slice of market share, while I\u2019m not a business professional, it currently seems to me that things will have to move quick from announcement of the idea so that competitors don\u2019t act first\u2026\n\nEDIT: typo",

These are two different business models. \n\nNext.. what do you anticipate valuating your ICO at? \n\nWho is your target demographic?\n\nFinally... is this a L1, L2, smart contract, etc?\n\nWithout that info any advice you get is a shot in the dark.",

This is a startup sub and the focus is on market size, # of competitors, business model, plan to scale.\n\nBunch of other stuff but I'll say the point is what do you think you need from someone to be successful with this idea?",

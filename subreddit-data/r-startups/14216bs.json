    "postText": "So long story short we\u2019ve started developing a saas company and landed a very high profile CTO through my network. My brother/Co-founder came up with the idea one night after I told him I wanted to start a business. I\u2019m a very proactive person so started working on it asap and did the business plan, pitch deck, and Figma prototype. I hired a developer and we got our first prototype developed. Now I\u2019m wanting to do a friends and family round which leads me into getting the company registered. Originally we were going to do 50/50 split but all the work this far has been 97% me. \n\nI really don\u2019t know what to do because all he\u2019s doing is holding me back from really getting this going. \n\nTLDR: co-founder (brother) has done nearly 0% of the work but came up with the idea. Don\u2019t know how to split equity now that I\u2019m registering the business.",

Set out an agreement and if he wants 10-20% then he should earn it by doing things. If he can\u2019t agree to certain achievable goals then I think that 97-3% could make sense.",

If he's the kind of brother that is an ass about it, seek out legal advice and make sure you can proceed while leaving him out cold. There will be plenty of digital evidence that you've been doing all the work so I think you could easily move ahead without him. Maybe give him 0.5% (Sorry but even 3% is too high IMO LOL)",

            "comment": "Here's a simple question: Which is more important; your brother, or the business?\n\nIf you push him out and it succeeds you might not have a brother.\n\nIf you keep him around and resent him, he might not have a brother. \n\nEven worse, if you push him out and it takes off, might your family declare that you screwed him over?\n\nNone of these are legal or financial issues. \n\nUnless you think this is the world's greatest idea and are about to become fantastically wealthy, I would strongly recommend thinking about dumping the idea and doing something else.\n\nHave a good talk with your brother and even mention the dropping the idea for the above reasons. If he is reasonable and has your best interests at heart, this might shock him into contributing. If he is a parasitical asshole he will probably try to guilt you into continuing and leaving him with a huge chunk.\n\nI would be wary if he does say, \"No no, don't worry about it, it's yours.\" unless this is what he and your family would expect him to do. \n\nLet's say you get 100% and run with it; then in 6 months you sell the company for 1 million dollars and your family hates you and your brother won't speak with you. Even though he seemed totally OK with giving you 100%. Or you get 95% and you cut him a check for 50k while you walk away with a million. Still probably pissed. \n\nSo, I will ask your future millionaire self, \"How much would you give to get your relationship back?\"\n\n\nGenerally, don't do business with family is a very good rule. I've known many siblings who were able to run successful businesses together. But, even on that front, I've seen when either bad times came, the stress ripped them apart, or when good times but big choices came, it ripped them apart. This after decades of partnership.\n\nIf you want to see this at its most fucked up; look at the story of the family of a US family which is famous for renttal trucks and trailers. (I'm not mentioning it by name as they probably have shills on this site).",

            "comment": "It's clearly on your mind. And that won't help. It will make strain your relationship as well as the company.\n\nBefore registering, you need to discuss with him each other's contribution and maybe even a performance valuation criteria, saying \"we gotta do what's in the right interest of the company and do justice to the customers\". And not keeping up to the mark would require bringing someone else onboard and relinquishing equity. So ask him if he's actually interested in working for the product or not.\n\nAlso, good co-founders before even setting up a legal entity, often setup a \"tough conversations and conflict resolution framework between each other\". This involves how to bring up things not working out and when co-founders have differing opinion, how will the next step step be zeroed on (like the decision making process).\n\nYou should set up that I think.",

In a similar way to you the initial idea for the venture was his however it is 6 months later and I can confidently say I have completed about 90% of the workload. Initially he wanted more equity as the idea was his however after giving him multiple references and sources I managed to show him that an idea on its own is worthless and the execution is everything. \n\nIn my situation we agreed on him getting 30%, at the time I thought he would pull more weight that he has; now I believe he has got too much equity for his contributions but it is more complicated as the company is registered and the shares have been issued.\n\nThe best advice I can give is to evaluate what each party brings to the table and quantify that so you can calculate shares. It is also important to set out targets for what each party will need to do in the future to give the venture the best chance of success but also so that one person doesn't end up doing majority of the work like in my case.",

I've heard Slicing the Pie can be useful because it serves as a semi-objective 3rd party tool to help determine what's fair. One approach could be trying to lead him to agree to use the tool. Maybe go through the exercise so list what we've done so far for the company and then what are responsibilities will be going forward. You need to engineer whatever situation you can that makes it very apparent that there is a HUGE discrepancy between the work you are putting in and the work he is putting in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegardless of the split you come up with, unless you agree that all of his equity is due to just his idea and he won't be contributing further you want to make all the equity under vesting agreements. So even if you still decide on 50/50 it's not immediate 50/50 it's earned over time working for the company. Then you would need to form a board of you, him, and ideally an independent board member. If it becomes clear that your brother is still not pulling his weight then as a board you and the independent member can end his relationship with the company and cease the vesting of his stock. But you would want clearly documented responsibilities and KPIs so you can demonstrate without a doubt that he was failing in his duties before you took any action. You basically should do everything you can to give him the rope to hang himself with so any legal challenge by him can be easily squashed.",

I did a startup where we were supposed to be 50/50 but my friend ended up doing a majority of the work, and we handled it just by openly talking about it throughout. It was a bit contentious at times, but we made it work (I ended up taking like 15-20% or something). \n\nIf you can talk and he doesn't really want to work on it, you could offer him something like 5% straight up for the idea. If he's interested in working but unlikely to actually do much, you could do something like vesting tied to hours worked, or offer him vesting advisor shares to join in on any high level discussions but keep him out of the day to day. There are a bunch of options but impossible to say what's best without you having a hard conversation up front.",

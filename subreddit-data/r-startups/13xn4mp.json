    "postText": "I\u2019m currently located in Virginia and looking to start building a relationship with a bank for future lending if needed. \n\nI\u2019ve used Sba.gov to see which bank lend the most 7a loans in the past few years. The highest VA bank is high 30\u2019s then take a deep drop from there. \n\nI see other banks located in Florida and other states that lend in the 2,000+ range or close to that . \n\nWould banking with an out of state regional bank that lends more often be a better option than going with a bank just because I\u2019m in the area. \n\nI\u2019m assuming all of our interaction will be over the phone anyway so is face to face beneficial or expected at all? \n\nI have my first customer through pre orders so \nI would be starting the account with $8K\nHardware startup \nAll Online Transactions \n\n\nAny thoughts ?",

    "postText": "Starting a new publishing company that in a nutshell is a publishing company of a set of different joint ventures = different web properties that all accelerate each other. Hence the idea to name it something along the lines of\n\nFlywheel Media Group\n\nThere is however already a company called Flywheel, Flywheel Media, Flywheel Digital; I tried a bunch of AI tools and tried to tap into my own creativity:\n\n\u2014 come up with something similar that is less spoken for online\n\n\u2014 come up with a smart artificial spelling of the name to the point where ppl still get it but I could actually have a good domain / be easy to be discovered\n\n\u2014 see if there is any synonyms that would make sense\n\nI have not come up with any great ideas and I am running out of time hence tapping into this hive mind! TIA! Will think of something if anyone comes up with a great suggestion we will use!",

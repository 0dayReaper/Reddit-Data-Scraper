    "postText": "Recently, I've identified a problem that I'm building a startup to address.\n\nThere are plenty of use-cases inherent to blockchain technology \u2013\u00a0trustless financial markets, creater-owned content platforms and tokenized real-world assets are a few that come to mind.   \nBut almost everyone I've spoken to outside of the web3 space associates blockchain with scams and fraud. They point to FTX's collapse (even though this was due to mismanagement and not any fault inherent to crypto/blockchain tech), or rugpulls/pump-and-dumps, and claim that they'd never use crypto without some sort of consumer protection.\n\nThus, I decided to create a service \u2013 which is now in development \u2013\u00a0that enables decentralized consumer protection for blockchain transactions.\n\nIf you've ever used crypto, or know anything about the space at all, I'm curious to get your opinion on the following:\n\nWhat has your experience been with scams and fraud? What precautions do you take against them, and why? In an ideal world where even grandma/grandpa can reap the benefits of blockchain technology through everyday use-cases, what else do you think should be done to protect everyday consumers and users?",

There are exceptions where 1 or a few figure things out.",

They will even eliminate black markets when it comes to buying and reselling tickets. You can actually own your money - and no bank in the world can prevent you from sending it somewhere else. Are we not going to use electricity from nuclear power plants because that same technology caused the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki?",

None of the above is true. If it were true, you'd expect (14 years of effort later) to have something to show for your efforts by now.\n\n&gt; Are we not going to use electricity from nuclear power plants because that same technology caused the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki?\n\nNuclear weapons and nuclear bombs use different ignition technologies. And different fuels. And different engineering. And different skill-sets. And so on. It's a facile comparison. They do, in fairness, share the word \"nuclear\".",

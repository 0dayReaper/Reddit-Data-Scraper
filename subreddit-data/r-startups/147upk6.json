    "postText": "Hi all! I own a UX Research consultancy geared towards startups and small teams, and I wanted to create a post to let others in this subreddit know how UX Research can help them, but also wanted to learn from you all on what's useful to you in this space.\n\nWe believe that resources should be put towards understanding your target users\u2019 wants, needs, behaviors, perceptions, pain points, etc. BEFORE investing heavily in building your product, but I'd like to understand what a startup founder's typical process, or what they're thinking and experiencing as they create their solutions, even before they consider UX and UX Research.\n\n1. If you or your team hasn't worked with a UX research and design agency or studio before, what are some of the reasons behind this decision?\n2. What does UX research mean to you, if anything? How do you think it can help you?\n3. What are some of the most frequent pain points you run into when building your product for your target audience?\n4. How confident do you feel in your decisions while creating your product? And what information do you feel like you need to help you feel more confident in your decisions for your startup?",

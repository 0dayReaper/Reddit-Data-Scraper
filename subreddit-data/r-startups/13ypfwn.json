    "postText": "Hi all,  \nJust looking for a bit of advice here.  \nI am currently working as SW engineer, based in EU. We are currently working on SaaS business and actively looking for clients. We didn't want to approach VCs and raise any money yet, we want to grow organically.  We did our research, and US/Canada would be a good next step socially and professionally.   \nWe did our research, and we explored possibilities to incorporate in the US. One can argue that in a post-pandemic world, where everything can be done remotely, why do you need to be in US. However, we have our reasons. We are thinking of places such as Boston, Houston, and Pittsburgh that are much more affordable startup hubs in US.  \nHow do we properly relocate and deal with VISA issues? do we need O-1 visa or other VISA type?.  \nSomeone suggested to get a job and come to US, work while developing the idea. I explored my options for my current role (Engineer).  \n\\- Internal transfer via L1A Visa requires 1 year condition, and working as a manager outside of US.  \n\\- H1B Visa are not trivial in this market/climate (i.e. layoffs). Moreover, H1B doesn't allow us to work on ideas apart from work.  \nI am looking forward to any advice from you guys!",

            "comment": "Let me break it down to you.\n\n1. Canada - Canada offers a startup visa where you can apply through a IRCC licensed immigration consultant or you can ask the consultant to suggest you a Visa type as per your profile and requirement.\n2. US - US offers an EB5 visa to people who invest $1MM into an approved project in a TEA(targeted employment area) or you can explore the E-2 treaty trader Visa route it's more flexible in terms of the kind of work that you can do, but it also does require around $200k in investment in a new or existing business also your country of citizenship must have a Treaty with the US for the E2 Visa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll in all, I would need more personal information from you to suggest a proper plan to immigrate to US or Canada. \n\nIn the meanwhile you can establish a company remotely in US or Canada, a lot of our clients establish company and banking ties in the country before they relocate that you would have a nice runway to land on as soon as you move, also it would require travel to the country to establish bank accounts. Company formation can be done remotely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks, Feel free to ask more questions. Would be more than happy to answer.\n\nDisclaimer - This is not tax or legal advice.

But eligibility has to be met separately for O1 through some other means.\n\nBut E2 and EB5 are more straightforward processing wise as pathway is well defined while O1 varies a lot individually and renewals are in 1 year increments only after the initial 3 years that it is granted for.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions.\n\nDisclaimer - This is not tax or legal advice.",

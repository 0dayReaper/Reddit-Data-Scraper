Would you need an investment to get things going initially?",

            "comment": "In those two cases Uber and Airbnb needed to manufacture sellers that didn\u2019t already exist - there weren\u2019t already apartments (or at least many apartments) available for this kind of short term rental. There weren\u2019t many people driving their own cars on a for-hire basis. And you are vastly underestimating Uber\u2019s subsidies in particular - in most markets Uber initially offered actual guarantees to new drivers as long as they were available to work for sufficient hours, such that they made guaranteed income even if the passenger demand didn\u2019t materialize. These were in effect individual new businesses that needed startup capital to become one side of the marketplace.\n\nAlthough Etsy has offered various financing tools and other services over the years to sellers, they didn\u2019t have to do nearly as much because there was a pool of craftspeople already looking to sell stuff,  so they already had their kilns and their looms. \n\nTwo sided marketplaces connecting existing buyers and sellers who are already in approximately the right form will take much less startup capital than marketplaces where either the buyers or the sellers need to be created for the market to function. \n\nThe question for you is, does your marketplace require someone else to take capital or time risk to get started on the supply side, or do you offer immediate value to the sellers?",

The risk on the seller side is that there will be no buyers. Sellers commit valuable time to the platform, and dont get anything in return.",

And you\u2019ll never make a dollar unless you are actively driving around. Also, at the time Uber launched no one (or very few people) thought of themselves as part-time for-hire drivers, so it wasn\u2019t like you they out an ad and all these people were like \u201coh yeah that\u2019s for me!\u201d They put up an ad that said \u201cdrive your own car for money\u201d and it sounded like a scam or like something that wouldn\u2019t work out and no one replied. So they added \u201cfree iPhone and revenue guarantee,\u201d and started to get more traction.\n\nIn the case of Etsy, you already make and sell silk-screened t-shirts at local flea markets, maybe you already have a web site where you post pictures of your stuff, so the time commitment is limited to the one-time effort to set up a store and put up pictures of your products, and then you can leave it and forget about it until an order comes in.\n\nIf you\u2019re like Etsy, maybe you don\u2019t need to offer these people much to get them on. If you\u2019re like Uber, maybe you do. \n\nIf you want to start a two-sided market place and you don\u2019t have the capital for seller incentives, find a market like Etsy where there\u2019s a built in group of existing sellers who can get involved at low or no activation cost.",

However, you still need to convince the sellers that they will get business on your platform, otherwise the reduced fees mean nothing. Which can be hard when there are no users yet. \n\nIn my experience, the vast majority of sellers will prefer a cash payment or direct incentive (iPhone, free photographer etc.) over a reduction in fees. I dont think Airbnb or Uber could have attracted hosts/drivers simply by offering them reduced fees.",

If a startup were able to just pull over profile data from elsewhere that would lower the hurdle, but you still have to attract people. \n\nAnother option is start with a captive audience and make it cool. Snackpass is a good example: https://foodondemand.com/07142021/snackpass-nabs-70-million-for-highly-social-digital-ordering/\n\nThey, of course, started cool, got traction, then money necessary for growth. Few have done it without a shit load of money to burn.",

Most places have technology now so you maybe able to side load your app in existing equipment and not have to provide hardware that didn\u2019t exist before.\n\n\nAlso make sure you can earn it back. I think Uber needed drivers to fit the demand they saw. Airbnb had people wanting to stay but needed photographers to add more properties. These were capital investments to catch demand similar to building a factory to increase supply so was a calculated investment assuming the demand stayed consistent.",

    "postText": "In the Southern part of a US state with \\~2m people, 3 Universities total, none heavy on research. Startup/entrepreneurial scene here is greatly overshadowed by Central/Northern part of the state.\n\nSouthern region is 150 miles by 150 miles approximately. I'm trying, with help of other stakeholders in the region, to establish a simple \"capture\" of a current or prospective (perhaps a student or retiring person etc) entrepreneur and some simple information about them (details, interests, experience level, desire for particular work and so on). That would become a \"searchable\" index for a variety of reasons. Even as simple as Airtable or Typeform to Excel or similar.\n\nI am looking for an example of a region that has done this already to get a few ideas on what it might look like as a landing page/process for our own region. This only for use as a resource for our region/not a business venture of its own and would be permission based. I've searched pretty thoroughly but can't find anything like this in particular. Thanks in advance for any help!",

If it\u2019s personas there are some open source incubators/accelerators that have that (I\u2019m on mobile, link not handy). Otherwise if it\u2019s specific people use typeface to collect the data and connect it to airtable. If cash is a challenge use Google forms. \n\nYou\u2019ll obviously want to be very careful about writing a clear data policy, documenting your permission to use the data, and protect it very well.",

We just can't find a good example of one that's being used already to get additional inspiration from... \n\nI've tried searching other similar regional areas but the accelerator capture model of *specific people* would be an additional avenue for research. Thanks for that suggestion!",

Take the lean startup approach and get something halfway good enough out there, try out whatever data you get, and see if it works. Then iterate. Just treat it as a signup sheet and try to get as many signups as possible to trial it.\n\nEvery region has different requirements, so it\u2019s probably unlikely that you can just copy/paste anyway.",

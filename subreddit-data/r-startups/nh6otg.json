    "postText": "And by overnight, I mean it took 11 YEARS and I SURE AS HELL didn\u2019t build it by myself. Here\u2019s my story, my epic failures, the successes, and the heartaches.\n\n**2010:**\n\nI was 22 and worked at an engineering firm as an assistant, and I sucked at it. I hated having to dress up and be someone different at work. I was miserable in corporate life.\n\nI got my real estate license because I wanted to sell million dollar homes. Turns out I didn\u2019t know any millionaires. Shit.\n\nI was like, \u201cwhat do all my broke college friends need?\u201d They need apartments! I started finding my friends apartments in my spare time, after work and on the weekends. I didn\u2019t quit my full time job because, that is scary duh.\n\n**2011:**\n\nUtilized my network on social media to find my friends and their friends apartments. In Texas, apartments pay you a referral fee if you are a licensed real estate agent and you send them a lease.\n\nStill I did not quit my job, because\u2026. that\u2019s scary duh.\n\n**2012:**\n\nGot my broker\u2019s license so I could start hiring people underneath me. I interviewed people after work and I stayed up until midnight every night posting ads on craigslist to find clients. Then I went to my day job at 7am.\n\n(MISTAKE) Still I did not quit by job. Because that\u2019s fucking scary duh.\n\nAt this point I was making about $8k/month from apartment locating part time, but for some reason it was too risky to quit my $20/hr job. Don\u2019t talk to me about logic, I have none.\n\n**2013: 5 people, $500k revenue.**\n\nMom died. That REALLY sucked. Read Man Search For Meaning and it changed my mindset. Said \u201cfuck it, might as well take this apartment locating thing seriously and start a company\u201d. Quit my job and opened the first tiny 500sqft office 3 weeks later. Launched a website.\n\nWow. Wish I would have quit sooner. So much more time to focus on business. Hired more people. Realized that they were better apartment locators than me, so I focused on my specialty, marketing and lead gen.\n\n**2014: 15 people, $1.2m revenue**\n\nInstagram started to blow up. We focused on posting the best apartment deals in the city. Like, the deal that we would want to lease that for ourselves because it\u2019s such a good price. Turns out, other people wanted to lease those too and we started leasing every time we posted a unit. Then properties started calling us wanting to be featured on our \u201cinstagram\u201d\u2026 I was like sure what are your 1 beds going for? \u2018$1400\u2019\u2026 and I was like okay we need those for $999, thinking surely they wouldn\u2019t say yes.\n\nAND THEN THEY WERE LIKE YES. I was like WTF?! TIGHT! And that was the birth of negotiated deals. BUT NOW SO MANY PEOPLE CALLING US.\n\nI was a FULL BLOWN PSYCHO about the client experience. I would fire agents who gave shitty service. That was different from what every other real estate \u201cbrokerage\u201d was doing. They wanted to hire as many people as possible. I wanted to hire as many AWESOME people as possible. I wanted people who took pride in their work, because I knew that would lead to a strong brand and a strong culture.\n\n**2015: 25 people, $2.4m revenue.**\n\nLiterally could not hire fast enough. So many leads.\n\n(MISTAKE) I started calling all my friends. I was like Oprah like YOU GET A JOB AND YOU GET A JOB AND YOU GET A JOB and everyone was like um hell yeah I\u2019m gonna quit my $40k/yr corporate job and go do real estate for triple the money.\n\nThe great thing about working with your friends is that you get to work with your friends! Shit got REALLY FUCKING FUN. It was like a party every day. We were all making money and having a blast. But I\u2019ll talk about the problems of hiring friends later.\n\nWe were all gas no brakes, just grow and figure it out as we go. No systems, processes.\n\n**2016: 45 people, 4.8m revenue.**\n\nWe hired another 20 people and grew again. Negotiated deals took off. We were leasing 20-30 units at a time at discounted rates, all from social media.\n\nI was working 80hr weeks and was exhausted, so I hired an assistant who ended up being a game changer hire. She would watch me work, ask me what I was doing and then say \u201cI can do that\u201d. I\u2019m like, you can? Oh! Within a month or so she was running a team underneath her. That freed up my time to focus on hiring more agents.\n\nOh hello, issues! Customer service started declining. People weren\u2019t following up with their leads, all anecdotal of course because we had no system to track.\n\nMy gut said it was time for a CRM because passing out leads via email wasn\u2019t cutting it. It was a mess.\n\nWe implemented Zoho as a CRM at the end of the year (before this we were passing out leads just directly to email). This would prepare us for scale.\n\n**2017: 100 people, $10m revenue**\n\nHired another 30 people. Launched another market in Texas.\n\nSO MANY OPERATIONAL ISSUES. EVERYTHING IS ON FIRE. WE NEED PROCESS, STRUCTURE, WE NEED AN ORG CHART, WE NEED ACCOUNTING?!?! Still running a $10m business on a spreadsheet.\n\nRead the book \u201cTraction\u201d by Gino Wickman.\n\nPromoted an agent to operations. PRO - he was a killer, working around the clock to help us implement everything in the Traction book. Pushed the business forward and created regular cadence for our leadership meetings.\n\n(MISTAKE) Titled him Vice President with zero Vice President experience. Because I don\u2019t fucking care about titles, I only care about how much I\u2019m paying. Well, that came back to bite me later when people want their pay to match their title.\n\nThe hardest lesson I\u2019ve learned in leadership is to be honest with people about their growth and if you believe they won\u2019t be able to get you to the next level, have a REAL and TRUTHFUL conversation. This is hard. Especially if you only have the budget for 1 person and the one you have isn\u2019t able to accelerate the company. I fucked this up many times in my career. I wanted people to like me, but it did the opposite. I was an inexperienced leader who just kept hiring over people because I was afraid to be real. What got you here won\u2019t get you there. I knew that, but I was too afraid to say the hard things. I wish I learned this lesson earlier.\n\nAlso hired a fractional CFO company. They tried to move us to accrual, but I didn\u2019t understand it so we stuck to cash.\n\nStarted to slowly put systems and process in place.\n\nTRIED to put accountability in place for the agents, everyone freaked out thinking they were all going to get fired so we took it away. Big mistake.\n\n**2018: 120 people and $13m revenue**\n\nHad to calm down on growth and figure out what the hell we were doing. We hired our first outside person, a Director of Sales. He was a game changer for allowing me to focus on growth while he focused on the sales team.\n\nRemember back when I hired my friends? It was all fun and games till you actually have to manage them. Or fire them.\n\nMost of my friends quit or were fired, and I lost them as friends. My inexperience as a business leader caused me lose people I cared about. It was an emotional year, but it was then that I realized I needed outside help.\n\nSo I joined Vistage and EO (networking groups for entrepreneurs). This was A GAME CHANGER. I learned so much from other business owners. Before this, I had no real mentors who were in their businesses every day. And I had no real working experience in leadership since I started this business so young.\n\nWe tried again to implement accountability but the agents all freaked out so we took it away, AGAIN. Still no clear accountability.\n\nImplemented Net Promoter Score to get insight into our customer experience. Turns out it wasn\u2019t great. Zoho was a nightmare, it was over complicated and leads were still falling through the cracks. Agents couldn\u2019t stay organized so we decided to build our own custom CRM. That cost a cool $1.2m. But it set us up for scale.\n\n**2019: 100 people and $19m revenue**\n\nRemember that custom CRM we built? Well that increased agent revenue per head by 38%. We were CRUSHING it. Growing and hiring people like crazy. Multifamily industry exploded.\n\nI was working nonstop, and I was so deep in the weeds I didn\u2019t have time to focus on the future. My Vistage group said I needed a COO and a CFO. I still didn\u2019t have clear insight into my numbers, but my gut said we were going to have to do a compensation change for the agents. Get ready for this, because this was one of the worst mistakes of my career.\n\nHired an accounting manager (instead of a CFO, another mistake). Another attempt to get us to accrual accounting, failed. For the record- I was being cheap here, having clear insight into my numbers is one place I wish I wouldn\u2019t have been cheap. This caused me so much pain.\n\nBecause I didn\u2019t have clear insight into my numbers, my gut said we needed to be at a lower comp for agents. I was afraid of risk. This fear cost millions and our reputation, and has taken over 18 months to repair. Having clear accounting is rookie shit guys, I know. I really wish I knew this back then.\n\nIn November of 2019, we HEAVILY adjusted comp downwards. We lost 30% of our team, which is about what we were expecting. Over the following 5 months, we lost another 30% of our team, resulting in us having to replace 60% of our entire agents. It was rough, and morale was low.\n\nHere\u2019s why we lost so many.\n\nComp mistake 1: We gave people only 2 weeks to make a decision on whether or not they wanted to stay. This was so dumb on my part. My fear was that they were gonna stop taking care of them and it would hurt the business. That was a poor assumption on my part. People need more time with comp changes to decide if it makes sense for them to stay or to look at the market to see what is out there.\n\nComp mistake 2: If they chose to stay, they were REQUIRED to sign a contract that forces them to stay until July 1, which is when our \u201cbusy\u201d season ends. This was such a huge fuck up. My thoughts were - protect the business and the rest of the team during its busiest season so people don\u2019t just say they\u2019re gonna stay and then leave mid Q2. I thought I was protecting the rest of my employees, but by putting these \u201cshackles\u201d in place, it made things worse. I realized agents were staying at my company because of a contract, not because they wanted to be here. (I later rescinded this contract and apologized, and we still had a majority of people stay through that).\n\nComp mistake 3: the comp plan itself. In one of our markets, it was backwards. I have no idea why we did it that way. The more you produced, the less money you made per deal. It was dumb. Also, our average agent take home for full time went to $60-80k. I thought that was a really great living for agents who were getting all leads provided, all they had to do was find people apartments. Turns out, there is a lot more variability, which is why we ended up adding back more comp in 2020.\n\nComp mistake 4: As CEO, I did not announce the comp change myself, my Director of Sales did. My thinking? At some point he has to take full ownership of the sales team. I was at home with my one week old baby, and I knew he could handle this. The perception from my team? That I was too cowardly to announce the plan myself. Is there some truth there? Absolutely. I didn\u2019t learn how to stop shying away from the hard conversations until after I hired my COO. (Will talk about him in a bit, he was a huge role model for me on how to be a better leader)\n\nFifth and most important mistake: I lost the trust of my team.\n\nOverall, I had to choose whether I wanted the agent role at the company to be an INCREDIBLE opportunity for a few, or a GREAT opportunity for many. I chose the latter. Let me be clear, I would make that same decision again, but I would roll it out so differently, and clear accounting means I could have done a less drastic comp change.\n\n**2020: 200 people and $21m revenue**\n\nIt took me over a year to find my COO and CFO. I had issues hiring \u201coverhead\u201d positions because I thought I could do it all, and I just couldn\u2019t justify spending the amount of money for the position. And these were expensive high level positions that I wasn\u2019t ready for before, but I knew I needed them now that I botched comp so bad. I was an inexperienced leader who needed help to get to the next level.\n\nI finally found two people who spoke about the culture and the people (and not just numbers) and I did everything I could to get them to join the team. I told them that they would have a TON of mess to clean up, and all of it was caused by me.\n\nOver the first 3 months of 2020, morale was rough. New comp, new C level positions, and we also built out our leadership team. A lot of new faces from outside the company, and I had lost trust. We continued to have high turnover.\n\nThen, BOOM. Pandemic hit. Fuck. I was scared shitless. But I\u2019ve learned what damage my fear could do now, so we did the complete opposite of everyone else. We decided to launch 3 new markets in 90 days. It was NUTS, we had sales leaders moving across the country for this company. After the initial lockdown, we had more clients than ever, so we kept hiring and kept growing.\n\nThen my CFO started and he cleaned up our accounting mess. Once I had clear insight into my numbers, he showed me that we could increase comp. I cried out of joy. So we gave some comp back to agents in July. It went well, but we were still earning trust back.\n\nMy COO taught me invaluable lessons about facing the hard stuff straight on. So I started talking openly about it. If there is hard feedback, I give it immediately. He made me see how good it is to put the hard stuff out in the open and talk about it in front of the whole company. To be real, and transparent. It is the most important lesson I\u2019ve learned.\n\nAnd the company is a better place and I am a better human because of it.\n\nWe put in SO MUCH STRUCTURE. SO MANY SYSTEMS, SO MANY PROCESSES. Leadership was able to set us up for scale. We focused on our new mantra, \u201chow do we help agents win\u201d. The more our agents crush, the more comp we are able to give back as we gain efficiency.\n\nLesson? Hire people before you need them. Inexperienced leadership can take down a company, and I am grateful that we didn\u2019t have that fate but easily could have. By the end of 2020 we were slowly earning back the trust of our people.\n\n**2021: 530 people, on target for $40m+**\n\nWe hired 400 people between November and March of 2021, and launched 2 additional markets.\n\nOur agent comp plans now have opportunities for our killer agents to make over $100k, with our top agents are making over $150k/year and we\u2019re hiring another 500 people over the next 12 months.\n\nLot\u2019s of work to do but grateful to still be growing!\n\nFeel free to ask any questions or if you want me to elaborate on any of the struggles. I didn't go too into detail on the successes, mostly because you can see we had plenty with our revenue growth. Plus, if just one person can learn from my mistakes, that would be a win.

I also worked 80 hours a week for about 6 years. Might have just been timing and luck with instagram. I have no idea, but I do know that we're at least 5x bigger than our largest competitor, but I don't pay attention to my competitors. I focus everything I have on whether or not we are better than we were yesterday, last week, last year. If we're better, then we're winning the game. \n\nHonestly I just got lucky and hired the right people, so yes it'd probably keep growing without me!",

Or you paid for a CRM-platforming service of some kind?\n\nDepending on the answer, your next step for long-term growth should be hiring a CTO that can turn your CRM into another revenue stream. Unless you want to expand your own company brand worldwide I suppose, it would make sense to license your CRM software, and maybe some training materials and/or support contracts, to areas you don't intend to expand to (like say Tokyo or Munich) ever, or anytime soon at least.",

But I also said I wouldn't go outside of Texas a few years ago so we'll see!\n\nYes, the custom CRM did exactly what we needed it to at the time. We hired developers to build us a custom attachment that would work with Zoho, and then we just ended up scratching Zoho and building the whole damn thing from scratch. We outsourced and it has come back to bite us. The architecture is basically no good anymore and hasn't been kind to us adding so many users. So we are now completely rebuilding the CRM with our incredible in house dev team, again, from scratch lol. But this time, it will be scalable!!",

Lots of sleepless nights, exhaustion, and one day I'd be riding a high and the next I'd get taken down, hard. But that was because I hadn't hired outside leadership yet. Once I did that, everything changed. My COO, People Director, and CFO keep me informed but I don't have to deal with the day-to-day. It's helped me reset, get my health back on track, and focus on the vision for the future. Granted, I'm still in the day to day a tiny bit... can't help myself :)\n\nHonestly I would say I didn't actually become a \"CEO\" until I hired my other C-suite guys. Before I was just an entrepreneur, or just running a small business, or doing director level duties. At this size it's a lot harder for me because everything I say/do sends a message. And I have to make sure I'm sending a consistent message. And for someone as ADHD as me, that can be tough and things can fly out of my mouth. I will most likely have to replace myself as CEO one day... but luckily right now I've got a STRONG leadership team that is holding the company together- I'm just setting the direction and making sure we're hitting the goals we set. Eventually I'd love to be like a Chief Fun Officer... Or chairwoman of the board... I dunno. We'll see!",

Diversifying lead source to create long term success was SUPER important to us. We know lots of similar (but smaller) companies who use only instagram as their lead source.

I try to do fireside chats (coined by my COO) where we just let people ask any question they want. So when they ask questions about comp, diversity and inclusion, mental health, market failures, people leaving, technology fuck ups, glassdoor reviews, literally ANYTHING. We are open and honest and transparent and just talk about it. It's been the one thing that has helped us build trust. Even if we're transparent enough to say hey, we actually can't talk about that right now because it's not ready to be presented, at least people feel good about hearing that it's being worked on. Also we just went open book this year. As a 100% owner of the company, I was always really nervous about this, the judgement, etc. And truly its been way less of a deal than I was expecting, and it feels awesome to have the whole company aligned on goals and the future.",

Thanks for taking your valuable time to share such a thorough and informative account!\n\nI've only ever run much smaller companies, but I have definitely learned the hard way that hiring/going into business with family or friends is a *terrible, terrible idea*. I know some people have special relationships and can make it work, but in general it is a great way to *destroy* relationships and make you dread each day. In the beginning, people tend to romanticize the idea of working with people they know, because it sounds fun and comfortable compared to bringing in \"strangers.\" No one ever thinks about what happens when tough decisions have to be made, when people get lazy, or weird, or break rules, start taking advantage of the situation or otherwise start behaving as though they are untouchable.

Were you able to maintain a reasonable personal life (friends / family etc) - feel like this question often doesn\u2019t get addressed with these success stories as it\u2019s also part of the cost / tough choice etc.",

She never complained when I was texting at dinner or on calls during vacations, and I'm very grateful for that. Once we had our son, I really pulled back my hours and that is when I decided I didn't want to work that much. Which just forced me think differently... how can I achieve growth/goals working half the time? Had to start thinking differently and hiring differently and taking more risk to be able to do that. But I can confidently say I work 35-50 hours a week now which is much better than when the business was in full blown growth mode and I was doing everything myself.",

Most of the time the pricing and availability is wrong, so you\u2019ll spend hours finding what you want, then calling to find out it\u2019s not available, or worse showing up and realizing it\u2019s $600 more per month than was advertised online. We cut through all that noise on the internet and tailor a list specific to what you\u2019re looking for. We save clients hours and help people through the entire process, making sure they\u2019re making an educated decision. It\u2019s not for everyone, but it\u2019s clearly a wanted service otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be growing. Also, properties call us first when they run specials or deals much cheaper than market rent, so we\u2019re able to save our clients sometimes thousands of dollars over the lease term. You gotta think- you look for an apartment once a year, we do it pretty much every 15 minutes. That type of knowledge saves time/money and it\u2019s a free service for our clients. Why NOT use it? :)",

Our biggest competitor is actually a lot of small mom and pop shops, so we'll lose a few people to them for higher commissions etc, but the small shops can't compare with what we offer from an infrastructure standpoint. We offer early pay at no cost, training and development, support, structure, accountability (some people don't want that, but the killers do), custom technology that makes them 38% more efficient, friendly competition with a leaderboard, being a part of an insanely fast growing company on the resume, team like culture, growth opportunities, an office to go to, monthly/quarterly incentives, etc. All of that usually outweighs the need for higher comp, because they know they can make more with a constant influx of leads and a solid software backing them. They leave because of US, because of things we do. Which is why I always look internally any time we have turnover, and now we give exit interviews to everyone who will have them. That helps us determine what we're doing wrong and we have to figure out how we can fix it.",

We have a pretty solid training program and support with our sales leaders but we could always be better. We built out the infrastructure last year in preparation of scale. Turns out that same infrastructure can probably handle another 400-500 agents with just a few more sales leaders/overhead positions. And yes I worry every day that we didn't get the right people, but also we are very good at getting rid of the wrong people fast. Normally you're supposed to hire slow and fire fast, we hire fast and fire fast. We have high fall off within our 90 day trial. I swear to god we tell people 7 times before they start that they have to work weekends because duh, that's when clients have time to look for apartments, but for some reason a month in about 15% of people are like \"yeah I want to turn my phone off at 6pm on Friday\".

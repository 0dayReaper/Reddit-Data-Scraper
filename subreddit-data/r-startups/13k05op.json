    "postText": "I have a business partner. I was his student and then we became partners. We\u2019ve done a lot of good work academically (papers, patents). And good work during the partnership: we brought a product to market with paying customers (small dollars). Our working relationship is a decade plus old. And our company was bootstrapped at the start of the pandemic. \n\nBut now, our relationship is stuttering. Business has slowed significantly. His family life is sucking up all his time. And he is not prioritizing the company while I still want to continue to grind through, pivot, find new markets. He thinks during this business lull, we should keep the business up and supporting existing customers but not actively work on new work. The economy and field we are in are in turmoil. \n\nWe both have other jobs. A lot of our arguments are about how he can\u2019t commit more time. As he is a professor, he\u2019s not quitting anytime soon. \n\nMy partner has been there for me in a large way when I had a rough time so I feel like I should be there for him and give him some space. But it\u2019s been a year. He still doesn\u2019t have the time to commit to the grind. And we spend a lot of cycles arguing about his availability. \n\nIs it time to call it quits?",

Everything you just said above. Tell them what you think, feel, and are seeing. Also tell them what you have heard and processed from them. Let them know what you want, and ask them what they want. \n\nFrom there you should have a very productive conversation on what comes next. Maybe your partner steps away but helps you find someone to fill the gap. Maybe they get reinvigorated and you go full steam ahead. \n\nYou two getting together and having an honest conversation with no judgement will go a long way. \n\nGood luck and feel free to reach out if you want to talk about this further.",

They're the people you can feel comfortable being with when things are tough. We're all on different journeys through our lives, with our own constraints and values. Your friends will champion your ambitions just as you champion theirs, even when it's a trip to Mount Doom.",

My friends know if I say something like that, it means I'm trying really frickin' hard to communicate clearly, and I might need their (i.e., the listeners') help to accomplish that. I'm not going to be concise, per se. And for as much energy as they're going to expend on hearing me out and making sure they understand what I meant, I'm probably spending twice that much making sure I am understood by them. Because I care. Because they are worth every ounce of energy I have. And because I know that they care about me and I'm worth their energy too.\n\nAnd yes, mine are really good friends. :-)",

Presumably you have co-ownership in the business today, maybe 50/50 or maybe in some other form. \n\nThe tool here is an additional grant of equity to you, with vesting conditions. You agree with him you're going to do more work than he is over the next few years, so you get equity that either time vests over the next three years, or vests according to the achievement of some milestone (at least $x in revenue from a new product line, or customers that aren't existing customers, or whatever). You have an incentive to get that done, he gets to keep benefitting from the business you built together.\n\nObviously you also need to deal with the social issues around your friendship and business relationship, but there are ways to keep the business together equitably once you have found consensus on who is going to do what.",

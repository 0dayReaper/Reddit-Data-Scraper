Invest in MEEEE FOR THE $$ AND THE VIEWS.\n\nEDIT2:  It was 4 drones purchased soo soo.. so that is a lot of potential digit losing on camera for the views you are losing out on.\\\\\n\nEDIT3:  TO LATE FUNDING ACQUIRED.  Go get bent.",

For YouTubers I\u2019d say the risk is pretty damn big because basically none of them actually make it.\n\nAlso do YouTubers need money to get started/going? Don\u2019t they just need a decent rig and they\u2019re good to go?",

With that level of risk, investors will most likely be wanting equity to make it more appealing than parking funds somewhere for an easy return.",

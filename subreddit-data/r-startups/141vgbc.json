    "postText": "10X is not good enough anymore.   Forbes issued a wake up call:  \n\n\n[https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/is-ai-opening-the-door-for-the-100x-founder/450149](https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/is-ai-opening-the-door-for-the-100x-founder/450149)  \n\n\nWe all know that it is possible to 100X returns now that we have AI.  This is undisputable, and anyone who thinks to the contrary will be left behind.   The bar has been raised.  We can't go back.  \n\n\nHowever, what AI solutions should we be using to accomplish that?   We have to find solutions to compete, but the AI gold rush is creating so much garbage.   The AI listing sites are not curated to the point that we can trust them.  It's nobody's fault,  its just happening so fast that it is inundating our ability to pay for, test, and recommend the good solutions. \n\nFor example,  I subscribed to a law-oriented AI tool today.  I will refrain from naming them until I hear from customer support,  but it was straight up broken.  When it did work, It had marginally better value than ChatGPT, and a worse UI/Workflow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Does anyone else have similar concerns or stories?\n* Does anyone here feel 110% confidence in an AI product that you would recommend it without reservation? \n* Is there any warning on a product that you would like to make us all aware of?\n* Does anyone have any thoughts on the Forbes 100X assertion?  Do it make you feel pressured?  excited? agree? disagree?",

I know you are likely talking about businesses that leverage CGPT versus the mothership, but I use CGPT more than Google at this point for anything where I need true answers. I have found that learning to ask the right questions is the key. I ask it to write a function in say Javascript or build some CSS where I am very rusty on front-end, when I get an error, I feed it right back in and bang, all better. \n\nIt is a force multiplier for me.  \n\nI hear your uber point and we are definitely in for a wave of AI crap similar to the Apps of early days (remember those) -- the good ones will rise and change the world.",

Maybe someday in the future, but obviously that value won't be equally shared (the economy won't just shoot up into the quadrillions). Some companies will completely dominate if they do it right. For now, slapping together tools like ChatGPT, MidJourney, ClickFunnels, etc. can boost your revenue, but it's not really a 100X opportunity.",

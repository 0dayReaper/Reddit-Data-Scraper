    "postText": "I'm in a fortunate position with my employer where I've spent the last 5 years reviewing pitch decks and hearing pitches from entrepreneurs all over the United States. Their ideas spanned biotech, SaaS, CPG, agtech, and more. The clients I've worked with have ranged from first time founders, Fortune 500 executives, and serial entrepreneurs. I've seen a lot of failures, some go sideways and fewer successes.\n\nHere's just some thoughts I've collected after having a slow weekend indoors to reflect.\n\n**Build a business, not an invention**\n\nI see this a lot with STEM or technical founders. They've finally managed to land on the calendar of a VC, and they waste the whole time talking about the technical ins and outs of how their awesome new invention is going to revolutionize the world. Unless the person listening to you also has that level of technical expertise, it's way over their head. VCs and investors understand business though. What's the business case? You may have found a huge problem and you'll solve it with your fancy new innovation, but what does it cost? What's your total addressable market? When will you hit profitability? If you don't come equipped with those answers, you're not getting anywhere\n\n**Focus on \"you\", not \"I\"**\n\nSo many pitches end with something like, \"If I just had the money, I can totally make this happen!\" Notice that the statement has nothing in it for the investor. You're asking them for tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, or millions. What's in it for them? Investors are not charities. Entrepreneurs often come to the pitch meeting thinking money is just going to rain from the sky if their pitch has just the right amount of buzz words and sweet promises of a future fantasy of becoming billionaires. An experienced investor is just going to roll their eyes at you.\n\nPut yourself in their shoes. What would you want to know if someone was asking you for that much money? Wouldn't you also want to know what's in it for you?\n\n**Fundraising is a full time job.**\n\nIt can easily take a full year from you building your pitch deck to finalizing your investment. It can take a full work week to find investors, woo them, get them to sign, and then manage them after the investment to ensure you're maintaining good relations. On top of all of that, you as the CEO have to manage everything else about your business - sales, marketing, logistics, growth, etc. Especially in this economy, no one is handing out free money just because you think you've got God's gift to mankind in your business plan. Expect to hustle. Hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, this post probably comes off as condescending. But I was a first time founder once too, and I wished someone just cut the BS and gave me this advice. Hope this is helpful to some of you, too.",

With investments one can build the business faster, may get more knowledgeable personnel onboard and significantly shorten the time it takes compared to boostrapping. With the caveats you have when having a vc in the business.\n\nI\u2019ve been working with a scrum team that created a service point including the backend, technical infrastructure from cloud, physical devices as a kind of PoS-system, integrations with payment operators, voucher payment system etc. All in all operations were in 5 different countries. It took a few months with people who knew what they were doing. Bootstrapping something that a skillful team can build takes significantly more time, you may have unrecognizable problems that may halt the process and so on.\n\nAnd not to mention that most people have limited funds and with a family and mortage the leeway is usually months, not years.",

If you have an opportunity to grow very fast and are fairly certain of it, taking capital to exploit that makes sense. In most other cases you are better off building what you can and creating value without capital. Investors also vastly appreciate profitable growth more than growth with heavy burn, because regardless of whether the model looks like it will run at scale (ie high gross margins etc) the profitability shows a maturity and responsibility that makes a strong ceo.",

I just felt that your comment needed to be nuanced as it was a good catchphrase but could be misunderstood as I did when I read it. But you're right we are probably on the same page and I couldn't agree more with the initial comment like you did. That said I don't think the distinction is trivial tho as it implies a lot about the business you can or cannot pick to bootstrap on, depending on where you are at in your life.\n\nTo finish I don't think there is a lot of entrepreneurs who can invest money in their business (at least not like a VC or even a BA could). So even if bootstraping means building from their own ressources, it most of the times means create revenue early (Not to mention all the benefits you get doing this for your product).",

That can be the way you plan to compete or build a competitive moat, but be aware of competitors, potential competitors and other ways to solve your problem. It\u2019s important for investors to understand how defensible the plan is - ie, can Salesforce throw $5m at developers and have the same product in 6 months or is it difficult to master or does it have defensible loyalty or a time to market issue that would make that effort not viable (the point being on exit will they acquire that business for $50m or for $5m).\n- second is probably bad marketing speak. People that are intelligent speak in simple words and relay messages effectively. If I read your site or hear your pitch and you are a \u2018solution for digitizing consumer sentiment for actionable market creation\u2019 - I have no idea what the fuck you do and neither do your customers. Speak plainly and get your concepts across.\n- final pet peeve is probably being irresponsible with burn. Burn is fine if there\u2019s a real growth opportunity, but present it responsibly and know exactly how you are going to spend money that gets to the balance sheet - down to headcount hires, how you are going to spend marketing $ and the results you expect.\n\n..ok last one while I\u2019m at it. If your business has been running for awhile, be analytical and know the data of your operations. Understand what you want to improve based on data, and understand where you are really succeeding and expect to scale based on data.\n\nYou likely have immediate respect from an investor for starting and growing a business - most of us have done it before and understand it\u2019s hard. Just keep that respect by really having done your homework and wanting to make the business big.\n\nHope that is helpful to some.",

Your market size should be above $1bn, your growth should be two-digit month over month, etc. \n\nYes, it's stupid and frustrating. But that's how it works, so as a founder, you must know investors' expectations and meet or exceed them at every slide of your pitch deck.\n\nI wrote a meta-analysis on what investors expect to see for a SaaS startup ([here](https://www.stephnass.com/blog/saas-ipo-roadmap)) and an illustrated guide to creating a startup pitch deck ([here](https://www.stephnass.com/blog/startup-pitch-deck)) if that can help. \n\nAlso, pitch your startup on [https://www.reddit.com/r/roastmystartup/](https://www.reddit.com/r/roastmystartup/) before pitching investors!",

                    "comment": "Most common issue I see is early stage entrepreneurs going after VC and sophisticated angels.  Pro tip - They don't invest in early stage.\n\nIf you are early you need to talk to real angels, who are everyday people and don't have 'angel investor' listed on their linkedin profile.  From my experience anyone who has Angel Investor as a title is an opportunist.  Believe it or not there are far more people out there who will invest in your company because they want to support you and don't want to get pulled into a ton of complexity.  They truly want to help you out and want to put their money in a good steward of something and someone they believe in.\n\nFunds have rules and it's a very binary transaction.  Either you have the numbers or you don't, yet so many people spend their entire time trying to impress them.  Funds are doing a disservice to most of the people they speak with by not telling them they are just putting them into their sales pipeline for future reference if you ever do hit the right numbers.  You may get there one day but you aren't going to 'get lucky'.  The terms are confusing and most of the information out there is based around the hype of this very small chance of raising funds.  If you don't believe this, the next time you are talking to a fund ask them what their funding requirements are.  They will tell you, and then you'll wonder why you're even talking to them.  They have rules because they are investing other peoples money, money they gave them based on the parameters they agree to invest in.\n\nSecond biggest issue is entrepreneurs not knowing which category they fit into.  If you're raising $1M, don't read strategies from people who raised $5M.  They are totally different.  The deck is different, the message is different, the timing is .. different.  \n\nThe entrepreneurs I work with I have them set a 2 meeting rule, if you haven't won someone over by then you're wasting your time.  Call 3 is get the wire info or move on.  Your goal is to blow their minds in the first 2 calls and if you're not doing that, you need to work on your presentation strategies.\n\nLastly know exactly what you need and build a a plan around getting it.  Much easier to raise $1M from 25k checks than finding someone to write $500k.  And if you can't communicate exactly what you need, when you need and what you're going to do with it, nobody is going to have confidence in you.  \n\nBonus tip, don't be wishy washy.  Saying things like 'we hope to raise' or 'if we could only' comes off weak and uncertain, the opposite of what's needed to get the money you want.  Exude confidence in what you say 'We are raising X, our revenue WILL be yy by xx'.  This is all rooted in being 100% confident in what you're doing and if you're not you need to work on whatever you aren't sure on until you are.  I don't think you can fake it and if you aren't 100% stop wasting peoples time.",

Very early-stage projects are supposed to be funded by the \"3F\" (friends, family, and fools) and business angels. You can also bootstrap by keeping a job on the side for some time. \n\nHaving said that, it is now easier than ever to build a MVP for cheap with no-code tools (check out Bubble, Glide, etc.).

Some big company reached me, that they love my product and they would love to invest in it and be my partners as a company.\n\nThat's called \"equity for services\" or \"services for equity\". \n\nIt is common with devshops who have plenty of programmers and designers, but also with media companies, who can offer \"free advertising\" in return for equity. \n\nPersonally, I would only consider it if I were looking for a strategic relationship with that company. I would also look carefully not only at the terms ($1M = how many hours of programmer), but also the enforcement of the deal (how are those hours counted, will you have priority over clients' projects).\n\nLast but not least, you may not want to outsource critical skills. If you are building a software company, then software development is a core competency that should be done in-house.",

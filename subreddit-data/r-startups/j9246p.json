    "postText": "Hey guys, like a couple of years ago, I was naive and foolish, \"founded\" a business with a couple. And I was out as explained in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/9bujuf/i_got_kicked_out_of_the_startup_what_went_wrong/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb)\n\nI learned from my mistakes and founded a business half a year later iirc.\n\nAnd this business is going quite well. Their business however failed hard due to Covid 19 as it was an event and promotion business. And my business is doing really well because of Covid 19 as I transformed it into an online business. \n\nWhat I founded was an incubator/accelerator. I used to create networking events and seminars where people  would physically come. Covid-19 happened so, I turned it into online seminars.\nAnd because of the lockdowns, I noticed people started to become more interested in online learning. And the audience keeps on growing. We are also partnering up with other figures and organizations and also getting some funding.\n\nI also got a professional looking website and a private email which my previous \"partners\" whom I fell apart with never wanted.\n\nI just want to thank you all for pointing out my mistakes in the previous post.\n\nA lot of people pointed out that I made assumptions and never got them to write things down on paper, and that I gave everything before getting anything from them.\n\nu/very_nice_how_much said\n\"*This is the part of the story where you become the competitor and run them over.*\"\nWhat s/he said stuck with me and it actually came true.\n\nNow I have registered the trademark on my name since the beginning so I can no longer be \"kicked out\". All I need to do is build the brand so it becomes valuable.\n\nThank you so much.",

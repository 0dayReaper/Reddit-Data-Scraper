Usually secured off the back of the founders career to date, maybe a v shoddy MVP\n\nSeed: still very early stage. Likely need a working MVP and some users/customers to show traction or the potential of growth\n\nSeries A: raised when a level of product market fit has been established. At this stage looking to scale \n\nSeries B: raised off the back of capitalising on your Series A and showing strong growth\n\nSeries C+: final funding rounds ahead of going public. Acquisition still possible after this stage but valuations are usually v high by this point\n\nWhether you choose to grow or be acquired really up to the founders and market conditions but startups are defined by looking to exit in some capacity asap as opposed to build a viable SME in the long-term",

You should still have exit strategies prepped for different stages of your lifecycle. Even if your heart says, \"I want to run this business forever\" it is still wise to be open and willing to exit. \n\nUltimately this is a business venture, an investment you are making, and your ultimate goal should be to see a return on that investment.  Whether it is a lump sum or ongoing small amounts should not matter. \n\nBeyond that, a successful exit does wonderful things for you. It opens up many new doors that were otherwise shut. You suddenly have a feather in your cap that others notice and see opportunity in themselves. That means your next venture is far more likely to succeed and requires fewer personal resources. You now have a much deeper and more enthused network willing to contribute to your next venture.",

There's a few strategies but you need an exit.  Sometimes it's a relatively quick exit and you are trying to get acquired by an established company like google.  Sometimes it means you are going to try to grow it until you \"IPO\" and go public like Uber.  Either way you have to have an event where the investors can cash out. They aren't funding your dream of being a CEO for the rest of your life of a small company.",

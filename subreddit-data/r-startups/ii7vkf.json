I've browsed many of them and I've found that unless your product is aimed at other makers/developers, these lists aren't super helpful (if your goal is to promote your product).  For example, if you sell a new app for restaurant owners, posting on /r/startups or Indiehackers isn't going to get you new customers, restaurant owners don't hang out in those groups.  If you goal is to get customers, you need to go to where your customers are.  So look for more niche groups, using my example you would want to start interacting with those in /r/restaurateur.",

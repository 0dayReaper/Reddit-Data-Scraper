    "postText": "We as technical founders have similar issues where we can build something, but may not have an idea, funding, market research, insight or any of the other non-technical parts of building a startup. \n\nIf you\u2019re bringing the idea, the best things you can do is bring money, and market research to the table. If one or the other cant be, then this sub has numerous recommendations for no-code tools that you can use to MVP.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis is just personal advice beyond this. \n\n\n\nDon\u2019t overdo the MVP: Use the tools the sub recommends, just build it. Ive only been a founding member at two massive startups and our first demos basically did not work or looked awful.\n\nOn tech founders: Don\u2019t believe in unicorn tech founders, we may be awesome but the better we are at tech, the less likely we are to have a balance in the other responsibilities. \n\nOn money: My advice may seem like a chicken and egg problem where you need to have a tech founder to build a tech company. You\u2019re not building a CDN or a message-broker(I hope not). For anything else, you can get away with a less than the best style founder. Youll need to bring money to the table so youll need to build an MVP yourself. Id personally avoid finding a cofounder at this stage just because its abdicating a responsibility you absolutely need to own when you cannot afford redundancy. \n\nOn market research: Devs rarely actually understand money, we just aren\u2019t incentivized to learn about it(for the devs reading, maybe you\u2019re the exception, I feel like we know this represents the most). If you can point to a group of people(even for b2b, who is your ICP)and say how exactly they will give you money, how much, how many of them are there, and show us you can get money from them. \n\nThis should get you a tech founder: That should help kick any tech founder into gear. IF IT DOESNT, you have an egomaniac in your midst, dont take it personally and find someone else. Genius comes in all ways and forms and please dont let the stereotype that rude tech founders are the only folk that exist. I have an amazing relationship with tier one VCs in my city and it\u2019s because im a gentle, passionate soul and they\u2019ve had the patience of dealing with my technical garble.",

            "comment": "I don't agree that tech founders don't understand business. Good tech founder should also be aware of business and how money works. The real reason why you almost always need wecond or third founder is because:\n1) you have complinentary skills\n2) non tech founder has massi e amount of industry experience\n3) most importantly, you ha e so msny tasks and obligations that you need some extra pair of hands\n\nTech founder without understanding of business is just a developer.",

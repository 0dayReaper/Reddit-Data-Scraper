    "postText": "I see lots of posts on this subreddit asking questions about\u00a0angel / pre-seed financing, so I figured I'd post some advice here based on my own experiences.\u00a0\n\n**Who am I?**\n\nI'm a startup founder and angel investor. I've started two companies in the tech space. My first company struggled to raise money, but my current company was able to get a sizeable pre-seed round done in &lt;1 month (at good terms!) because\u00a0I didn't repeat mistakes from my first go-around. I've also worked as an investor before shifting into tech, so I know how early stage investors approach these types of deals.\n\nSo here we go...\n\n**1. Don't do a god damn thing until you're 100% certain a raise makes sense for you**\n\nRaising equity financing, especially before you have meaningful metrics that indicate success, can be a complete crapshoot of a process that wastes valuable time and completely demoralizes you. I would not recommend even attempting a raise unless you have significant belief in your mission and your ability to get in touch with and convince investors. Here are a few things to think about as you contemplate whether a raise makes sense:\n\n***Do I \"check the boxes\" for venture backability?*** To be considered a potential \"high-flyer\" venture capital eligible business, you'll need to prove that you're attacking a large market (tens of billions or more), that your product is differentiated and a significant improvement over existing solutions, and that your team is uniquely positioned to scale extremely fast in that market. If your contemplated company is one that can't scale as quick as a software or internet company (ex: brick and mortar retail, construction), you'll definitely have a harder time raising money. If you're a solo founder / first-time founder, you'll have a harder time raising. If you're in a super crowded / hard-to-differentiate / low barrier-to-entry space (think consumer iPhone app), you'll have an extremely hard time raising. If you're raising money for a more old-school business model or one that isn't built to scale in tech fashion, you're much more likely to succeed in raising a small amount of money at a lower valuation from friends and family. If you can address core business issues that could hurt you BEFORE raising, do it!\n\n***Do I have a means to reach investors?*** Cold emailing investors rarely ever works, and I wouldn't count on it working. If you don't have a network that can get you out to 10+ prospective angel investors, spend time building out that network before contemplating a raise. One or two potential meetings will almost never get it done. If you want 5 checks of $50k in your angel round and you are hyper confident (close 25% of investor meetings), you'll need to get in front of 20 people minimum to get things done. Momentum in a raise is EVERYTHING, so if you can't have a couple of easy early wins with contacts that may be easier to close, you'll have a hard time raising.\n\n***Have I actually developed the business enough?*** Have you done all you can to develop the business without outside money? Is your product built and are you actively trying to reach customers? If your product requires outside money to build, have you at least scoped it out in detail and discussed the product in detail with prospective customers who want to buy it? If your business completely depends on raising outside money and you're unable to show any momentum during your raise process, it'll hurt your process of raising. Also, a lot of investors are wary of investing in a company that can't progress at all without outside money. Almost always a bad sign (although there are exceptions).\n\n**2.\u00a0 Materials. Have them ready.**\n\nBefore reaching out to anyone, you should have a good, short deck prepared. If your business has customers, I'd recommend putting together a simple spreadsheet that details unit economics of the business to help investors better understand your business model. [Here](https://www.canva.com/learn/pitch-decks/) are some examples of good early stage fundraising decks.\u00a0\n\nMAKE IT LOOK GOOD AND KEEP IT SHORT. Ugly decks will hurt you. Long decks won't get read. &lt;15 pages and minimize text where possible. Focus on only key points - problem, solution, business model, traction, competition, team, funding needs\n\nHave a few smart people look at your deck before you take it to market. If a random person with no knowledge of your space isn't excited about your company after reading the deck, fix it. If a random person doesn't understand what your business does after reading your deck, redo it completely. Sector knowledge shouldn't be a requirement for understanding the deck.\n\nDecks get shared often, so make sure you're comfortable with whatever you send to people getting passed around. [DocSend](https://www.docsend.com/) is helpful if you want to be in control of what people can see / version history.\n\n**3. Set the terms so others don't have to**\n\nThis is where strategy starts to come in. Ultimately, your aim should be to pick terms that are reasonable but favorable and have all round participants comply, rather than have to negotiate separate terms with a bunch of investors and deal with a messy cap table. If you can get 1-2 anchor investors who you're close with to close quickly at your terms, you can then stand firm on specific terms as you continue raising the round. You'll want to be firm on both valuation and structure.\n\n***Valuation:*** Angel round valuations are very subjective and heavily \"vision-centric\". Generally, multiple-time founders, SaaS products (software only, 90%+ gross margins terminally), and online marketplaces can come away with good valuations before having anything done in today's fundraising environment. D2C consumer products, anything brick-and-mortar, or anything that's a mobile app, will have a harder time commanding good terms and will likely need revenue and traction to get funded. Also, angels will typically want a sweetheart deal on valuation because they're giving you checks early-on and taking on the most equity risk. From what I've seen, a good angel round company can raise at a $1 - $3M pre-money valuation, $3 - $5M pre-money is great, and $5M+ is excellent. [Here](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/vc-valuation-trends-in-7-charts) is a dataset indicated that median pre-seed rounds are at a $3-4M pre-money valuation, but note that this dataset includes small seed rounds / companies with more traction than an average angel round as well.\n\n***Structure:*** I recommend using the [YCombinator SAFE template](https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/). It's industry-norm now for angel rounds, and allows you to get paperwork done with no legal fees - simply download the template and change the discount rate / valuation cap. The product is also very founder-friendly. Some savvy investors might not be okay with signing SAFE docs, but if you get a couple of people to sign term sheets and wire money early, you can simply play the \"well everyone else is on these terms\" card. Also, make sure you know the difference between a [valuation CAP and valuation](https://www.startuplawblog.com/2014/02/21/what-is-a-valuation-cap/).\n\n**4. Determine your outreach strategy**\n\nYour outreach strategy should help you create an element of scarcity around your funding round. You want people to get the feeling that they're talking to a hot company and that waiting could cause them to lose a deal. For these reasons, I'd recommend talking to investors who you have the highest expectations of close first, and then doing broad outreach after. Focus early meetings on friends or close members of your network, try to get them to commit verbally to a minimum amount and structure, and then add up what you're able to verbally close. Then, you can reach out to more investors who you're less close with and say \"hey, XYZ and XYZ have already committed to invest $200k in a SAFE at $X valuation cap. I'm aiming to close the round in 2 weeks and am fine with this amount, but happy to chat if you're interested.\" For people that don't know you as well, this will go a long way in conveying legitimacy and scarcity. If you can't close your best prospects, perhaps reevaluate before going out to others.\n\nAlso, make sure to be exhaustive. Closing a round with several investors will take tens of meetings and lots of rejection. Don't just go to people directly in your network, ask people you know and trust who they might be able to introduce you to. When you meet with those referrals, ask who they might be able to introduce you to. Some of my angel round participants were friends, but others were second and third-degree connections. If you only chat with 10 people on your round, it's almost impossible to expect even 2 checks.\n\n**5. Close fast**\n\nMoney isn't closed until it is in your bank account. I've had angel round participants verbally commit and sign term sheets only to pull back in the last second. This is not just normal, it should be expected. When someone gives you a verbal commit, get them a term sheet immediately and aim to get money wired as soon as you can. Investors are fickle and just a few days of waiting can have them waffle on the decision to invest.\u00a0\n\n**6. Draw a line in the sand**\n\nIf things are going well, don't get addicted to fundraising and raise more than you need. More stakeholders means more dilution and investor-related overhead. If things aren't going well, don't keep begging for meetings and hoping you'll get a check. Reevaluate your situation and make some progress with the business before going back to market. If you're spending more time fundraising than running your business, you should probably rethink your fundraising strategy one way or another.\u00a0\n\nYou can expect a best-case fundraising process to be done in a month, and a more regular process to take 2-3 months. If you're raising for 4+ months, perhaps take some time to reassess. Be cognizant of the message this sends to the market too - nobody wants to buy the house that has been listed on real estate websites for 6 months.\n\n\\--\n\nHope this helps people on the sub!

Great write-up.\n\nTo jump in and add some flavor:\n\n* Fundraising is really a 3-9 month affair for most founders. 3-6 months of networking and achieving milestones, 1-3 months of actually \"Raising\".\n* Have a 1-2 page executive summary along with your deck. It should cover most of the same topics. Don't send more than that, it will not be read.\n* If you need less than $50k to achieve your next milestone you may want to consider other funding routes like SBA loans, grants, pitch competitions, et al.\n* Go in with key milestones: \"XXX,XXX lets us achieve A, B, and C\". Hiring is not a key milestone (it is an enabler). Revenue, key product features, MVP, and product-market fit are some examples.\n* Investors are worth more than money. Look to target Angels and firms who can provide resources, connections, and expertise to help you scale more effectively.\n* Not all investors are the right fit.",

Some of our investors have been amazing, while some have been complete pains in the ass - wish I didn't have them in our cap table. \n\nIn general I've noticed that the best kind of investors are successful founders. They've been through it so they can give your great advice when you need it, introduce you to their investors (who trust them, so will be interested in meeting you) and otherwise stay out of your way. Former founders who have become VCs or angels are also generally excellent.\n\nThe worst investors are (usually) finance professionals who have suddenly become VCs or angels because its now cool. These guys and gals have never built a business and think no end of themselves because they wrote you a check. They require constant time consuming updates and require all sorts of data which they then extrapolate off of. We recently had one of our investors ask me to show him the bridge from our current revenue to $100m ARR in 5 years. Bro, we are a pre-seed startup that just got our first paying customers. Hold your horses!! These finance VCs also have a lot of product \"advice\" which doesn't really make sense for us and then get upset when we don't incorporate it. \n\nI'm sure there are some finance VCs who are great (Bill Gurley of Benchmark was a finance VC himself and he's become a legend..) but this has been my experience and the experience of my founder friends.  \n\nIMO, the best investors for a pre-seed round in descending order are:\n\n1) Successful founders\n2) Founders who have become VCs\n3) Industry thought leaders in your industry\n4) Friends and family\n5) Finance VCs\n\nFor avoidance of doubt: I define Finance VCs as anyone who works in Venture Capital without previously having founded a company or worked for a successful startup. The typical career path for these finance VCs is top 10 undergrad --&gt; 2 years banking or consulting --&gt; business school --&gt; VC. These guys and gals tend to be extremely full of themselves and have no real life experience that could be helpful to you as a founder.",

In many respects, the SAFE resembles the classic convertible note. Like the note, the SAFE will (1) convert into convertible preferred stock when the company issues such stock in a priced equity round, (2) typically contain a valuation cap that sets the highest valuation that can be used to determine the conversion price, and (3) convert into stock at a discount to the price paid by the new venture capitalist. Unlike the note, however, the SAFE lacks a maturity date and does not accrue interest. In essence, the SAFE is a convertible note that has had its debt-like features stripped away. \n\r\n&gt;This unique combination of attributes means that it is difficult to classify the SAFE as either debt or equity. It lacks two of the key hallmarks of a debt instrument: an interest provision and a maturity date. It also does not appear to be equity because it does not give the investor the rights that are typically associated with holding equity, such as the rights to receive dividends or to vote on matters relating to the governance of the corporation. The SAFE is best conceptualized as an equity derivative contract by which the investor commits capital to the company today in exchange for the right to receive stock in the company in a future financing if certain contractual conditions are met. If this future financing never occurs, then the SAFE will likely be worthless. If this future financing comes to pass, however, then the SAFE will convert into the securities issued by the company pursuant to this financing\u2014typically convertible preferred stock\u2014at a discount to the price that the new investor is paying for that same stock.",

It'll shift the needle a bit but is not going to negate it for most experienced investors/firms.\n\nI will say: if you are a technical founder (or at least not just \"Business/Ops/Marketing\") it is a bit easier to sell yourself as a solo founder than if you're non-technical. Why? You can usually produce an MVP and show some product-market fit which lowers other barriers to investment.",

Kickstarter projects are not a good proxy for VC backable startups IMO because those are mainly indie projects. \n\nFrom the article:\n\n\"The research is based on a survey of creators for thousands of Kickstarter projects between 2009 and May 2015. About 28 percent of the sample was made up of solo founders, 31 percent were two-person teams, and 41 percent were comprised of three or more members.\"\n\nThe second article from TechCrunch which looked at Crunchbase data was more interesting. I'd be curious to dive into the data (but don't have access to the Crunchbase API they used). As a 3 time founder (first two startups I was the solo founder) I can anecdotally share that having a cofounder makes this whole thing 100x easier. The emotional toll running a startup takes is very real and its REALLY helpful to have someone you can relate to / bitch to.",

We all signed a founders agreement with a vesting schedule but previously had spent about a year and a half working on it. Fair to mention that two of us had no kids, third founder had kids but also a wife who was employed in a stable job.\n\nA big factor for us was derisking the leap. We knew we had an MVP with promising product-market fit and we all had a plan if things didn't work out (emergency fund, spouse, a way to cover healthcare, etc). I'm personally a big believer in not quitting your day job until it is truly getting in the way of progress and you've derisked sufficiently.

The link is here: https://wargamechampion.itch.io/heroes-and-monsters-1-from-the-abyss\n\nI'm applying to ycombinator with a video game company. I plan to release 2 to 3 games a year, each a diagonal upgrade from the previous one. The Ycombinator funds will allow me to finish 3 games within one year.\n\nThe game I linked you is playable, but it's not complete. I really need an artist to do artwork and help me with the user interfaces. Otherwise I need to keep adding content and finish the story. There is about 5 hours of gameplay, and I'm working towards 20. I need around two months of my time tops in order to finish this before I can move on to game number 2. It may take my future artist longer than 2 months, but that is perfect as it will allow me to go ahead with the second game, and rough out all the engine changes.\n\nBased on the criteria you gave, I don't have any chance of getting funded by the sound of it. I think my case is different, and I can hit the billions in 5 years or so.\n\nAnyways, I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks.",

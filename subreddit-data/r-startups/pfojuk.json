Every magazines and online tutorials focused on grandiose designs that are often unrealistic and out of reach for the common household.\n\nMysitio aims to put the common folks in the driving seat for sharing designs knowledge by blogging their experience - something as simple as flower placement, pens station, monitors stand, IKEA tips and tricks, etc.\n\nBut in general, my personal aim is to find out how others utilise their home decor ideas to maximise the utilisation of space in the space-deprived place like Hong Kong.\n\n**Features**: Mysitio will make use of an inventory feature where users can store photos of their home decor items in their profile, from which they could\n\n* share the items as is;\n* categorise them into different saved lists (and generate a QR to share this saved list);\n* blog about their items or saved list; or\n* post an item for sell or exchange.\n\nAs an example for use case - if an Airbnb host wishes to list some of their home items for sale (so the guest could take a painting, a mug, or slippers as souvenir), the host could show the QR code to the guest which would show a list of items for sale at the house.\n\n**Role:** Founder/Developer\n\n**Goal this month**: building a demo for trial and testing based on Laravel as a PHP backend framework and VueJS as the frontend.\n\n**Reddit help**: Need someone to talk to, to validate the idea and just general brainstorming.",

Finally, we transfer those tokens from Dynasty treasury to a burn portfolio that is specified in our smart contract.

H. Industries is modelling use of a novel propulsion method and could have them arriving weekly in orbit around Mars by 2030 to supply the next step of human space exploration. If we stockpile supplies before their arrival, we can have bigger crews that stay there longer and grow a sustainable habitat with reliable low speed, lost cost freight shipping.

It helps users organize, manage, and share important information so those who rely on them have what they need, when they need it. \n\n* Our CEO lost his grandmother in 2017. His family, when they should have been celebrating her life, dealt with the frustration of having to track down her information. It ended up taking over a year to collect everything they needed. We built Kinnect because we believe that this is a predictable problem, and can be avoided. \n\n* In the future, we\u2019re planning to add photos, videos, and stories. We\u2019re also building out a professional workspace (think wealth managers, attorneys, accountants, etc.) to allow them to collaborate with clients. \n\n* You can see more about how Kinnect works with this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb0HHKFOz18)\n\n**More details**\n\n* We\u2019re at the validation stage, having launched our closed beta last month on Product Hunt. My mother finds the platform easy to use, so hopefully you will too!\n\n* I\u2019m a product marketing manager and co-founder\n\n**What goals are you trying to reach this month?**\n\nWe\u2019re hoping to have a few thousand users by the end of the year. Mostly looking for feedback this month.\n\n**Discount for r/startup subscribers?**\n\nAccess to the closed beta.

And yes, increasing transparency, reducing need for probate, etc. are among our goals. \n\nThe commercial aspect, at least from my perspective, seems to be more on the professionals side. We have *some* market validation on that side, but the trend so far seems to be that professional services are becoming commoditized and professionals are looking to add value as a way to preserve their fees. The family side seems more limited, as it would have to be free in order to attract most people. But yes, we would hopefully have users for life once they signed up.",

The desire for comprehensive, integrated products and services has increased even faster.\n\n**What life cycle stage is your startup at?:** Validation (MVP launched, currently in Pre-Alpha development)\n\n**My Role:** Project Manager/ Founder\n\n**What goals are you trying to reach this month?:** 2000 users\n\n**How could** r/startups **help?:** Integration is going to be a massive part of our generator.

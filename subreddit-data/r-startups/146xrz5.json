    "postText": "Let me know if this is the wrong flair or the wrong kind of post. Doesn\u2019t seem to violate any rules but I could be wrong. \n\n\nSomething that I think is sorely lacking in the SMB space for IT is a proper SOC or SOC solution. From my research, most of the SOCaaS solutions out there are focused on enterprise solutions for larger scale organizations looking to either outsource their SOC requirements to a full service or implement a smart tool that eases the burden on their organization. Due to the pricing of these tools and services, that leaves SMBs out in the cold to either try and figure out the security themselves or just \u201chope for the best\u201d. \n\nI\u2019d like to start a company that focuses on a SOCaaS model to provide cost-effective security monitoring and defend services to SMBs that want to invest in their security but don\u2019t necessarily have the funds to hire the right talent or pay for the big name tools. I\u2019d primarily service my customers using cloud monitoring tools that I\u2019m skilled in to provide these services to my customers at a rate that isn\u2019t \u201ccheap\u201d but is more affordable than paying out a bunch of salaries or subscriptions to tools. \n\nServices provided, depending on the service tier, would be:\n- Security Monitoring and alerting\n- Incident response and remediation\n- Security configuration\n- Endpoint management\n- Security Consulting on new projects\n\nI know it\u2019s not the most original idea, but I\u2019m leaning into my skillset and want to focus on the affordability and feasibility for SMBs who I often feel are left out of the target audience for such services. \n\nThanks in advance for any feedback you have. Forgive the formatting, I\u2019m currently on mobile.",

            "comment": "So I did a SMB cybersecurity startup before pivoting (mainly focusing on smaller rather than medium sized businesses) and I\u2019ll tell you right now, out of the hundreds of small businesses I talked to (since it was designed around them) they did not give a single shit. Most didn\u2019t even know they had malicious actors digging around and they didn\u2019t care unless something really bad happened. Even with how it was a mostly automated system and didn\u2019t have to do much. \n\nThe medium sized businesses cared a bit more but it then started to take away the original vision I had for it (hence the pivot because I didn\u2019t want to go on in that realm)\n\nI only prototyped it so I could have something to show and demo so wasn\u2019t a huge loss. This was also like, 4 years ago so things could of definitely changed. \n\nTLDR: I wouldn\u2019t waste time with actual small businesses, I\u2019d go for medium-large/enterprise if I had that drive and tailor the tool like you\u2019re doing to help them speed up that oh so tedious process.\n\nHappy to answer any questions",

            "comment": "It's a tough one, we work with a lot of SMEs and yes, many don't care about cyber security issues but more and more are being forced to if they want to sell to enterprises or the government\n\nThe problem has always been that the cost of services are so high that they become prohibitive and because it isn't necessarily a cost of producing the goods / services the SMEs offer they find it hard to account or accept thr additional cost\n\nI definitely agree with the other commentator that says that you should target medium and enterprise businesses for your core income but you should look to se if you can build a more hands off, automated bas offering for startups and smaller businesses where the costs work out if you can get a certain number of customers\n\nI've been talking to some vendors to see if I can take the cost of one license and spread it across 10 companies but most of the big vendors aren't geared up for that",

This has been an unexpected finding but as a fellow GI patient, I am really passionate about making this more known but don't know the first thing about doing clinical trials (which I am guessing to make this claim). Or, is it possible to sell this product based on customer feedback for IBS as long as I don't say it \"cures\" Do I need to have clinical research done to make these advertisements? And, if so, how does one go about this? What is the most cost-effective way? (Asking as a small business owner)\r  \n\r  \nThank you for any advice you can share.",

The idea that technical cofounders must be paid is so silly to me considering how advice I get is to learn to code myself.\n\nWhat I mean is this. If I was to learn to code and build a full stack application that would take me over a year. If a full stack developer did it, they could build an MVP is a month working full time. \n\nSo what that means is to me, is why would a full stack dev not be interested in working part time for free. Why not, if the developer thought the idea was that good, would they not be interested in throwing a few hours a week at a side project.\n\nI don\u2019t understand the idea that founders are expected to work full time jobs (like I do) and do everything to build their idea (for free) but cofounders always want to be paid. \n\nI want to be paid.\n\nThis is basic logic. The only difference between me and the cofounder is that it\u2019s my idea. If the technical cofounder had their own idea they would happily build it for free and not pay themselves.\n\nThat means the only limiting factor is the idea being good enough not the actual money.",

If you aren\u2019t paying cash then you need to be paying them in serious equity, because you are also getting paid in serious equity, if they wish to take equity as a form of compensation. If they want cash, then you cut down on what they would get as equity. Not sure why that is so hard to understand. \n\nAlso, you saying that the only difference is that it\u2019s your idea is ridiculous. There is a gaping chasm of ability between you and a technical. You can either close that chasm by learning to be technical (you probably won\u2019t because despite you saying the idea is that good, few every actually do what is needed to execute), or pay up baby. After all, non- technicals with ideas are in plenty supply. You\u2019re not in a strong negotiating position.",

    "postText": "Hey Everyone!   \nI\u2019m the founder and CEO at a successful SaaS Startup. We have a social media scheduling tool that is competing with the best in the industry. \n\n  \nWe\u2019ve tried many things over the years to try and make it easier for customers to make a purchase decision. Among these was the decision to implement free demo calls where we service any concerns/questions that aspiring customers may have and also give a complete demonstration of how one can use every feature in our platform. \n\n  \nIn this way customers can get a complete idea of what the tool does and put to bed any queries that they had.   \n\n\nOver the years we\u2019ve seen varying results from this activity and there have been plenty of **no shows** where someone books a call and doesn\u2019t connect within 15 minutes of the scheduled time. We\u2019ve also had **many spam calls** and calls from people that thought the tool does something entirely different to its use case. \n\n  \nHowever, as we\u2019ve tried and tested over the years, these demo calls have become a staple and **contribute anywhere from 20-25% to our quarterly revenues.** \n\n  \nWe also often form a strong connection with our customers through these calls and end up collaborating with them for certain marketing efforts. \n\n  \nWe\u2019ve seen that demo calls give our customers a piece of mind and build trust between the two parties that is otherwise hard to do via other mediums like email or social media.   \nI\u2019m sharing this here in hopes to help other SaaS startups that are in that stage of figuring things out. Feel free to reach out or AMA if you have any questions. \n\nAlso, I'm keen to learn any other marketing strategy that can be tried out too. \n\nBest",

            "comment": "A) im never going to pay anyone for a demo of any software. Period. They are all free and you aren\u2019t fooling anyone. \n\nB) i dont want to talk to you. Build a good tutorial system, build example use youtube videos and stop gatekeeping my decision making process. \n\nC) if you ask me to book a demo when I ask you a question about your product and don\u2019t answer the question it tells me you don\u2019t value my time or your time and that your product isn\u2019t good enough to sell itself and you are using both the sunken time cost fallacy and the squeaky wheel method as a crutch for sales. It also shows poor customer support. \n\nD) why are you doing demo calls to begin with? Anything less than $1,000/mo doesn\u2019t need one on one sales for SaaS. Its a waste of time and resources. Spend your time on documentation and marketing instead.",

I agree with all points, however, there is another perspective where people don't want to actually go and read/watch the documentation or video tutorials and prefer having a demo call with 2-3 of their team members sitting in the demo too.   \n\n\nIt's just that everyone have their own way. We have documentation and walkthrough videos regularly updated and placed in the product. \n\nFun fact, some people still ask about our PRICING during the demo calls even though there is a dedicated page for PRICING on the landing page.",

Instead of lengthy email exchanges or back-and-forth messages, a demo call help to provide a live walkthrough of our product or service. During the call, we can address any questions or concerns you may have, showcase key features, and tailor the demo to your specific needs. I find demo calls to key makers of your business, I see demo calls may consume your employee's energy and time, but yet a great thing this could get you more business and customer satisfaction.",

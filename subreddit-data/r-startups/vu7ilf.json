But I\u2019ve seen how valuable the right process can be to mitigate the risks.\n\nAnd it all starts with having a problem, not an idea.\n\n# 1. Make Sure You Have a Problem, Not an Idea\n\nA pattern I\u2019ve seen among successful entrepreneurs is that their ideas tend to be directly related to a problem they\u2019ve seen or experienced.\n\nUsually, having worked in a specific industry for several years, they spot an inefficiency that people within that industry face.\n\nThen they set out to solve it.\n\nBy setting out to solve a problem or inefficiency, you\u2019re in a much better position to succeed \u2013 and are far more likely to avoid becoming one of the many startups that fail due to no market need.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve identified the problem, it\u2019s time to make sure you have the funds to commit to this journey.\n\n**Tip:** Don\u2019t infer that there will be a demand for the product you\u2019re going to build. You have to quantify customer action \u2013 not the intent. The burning question is will users like your product enough to take action at a cost that will enable you to run a sustainable business?\n\n# 2. Work Out How Much Runway You Have\n\nIt\u2019s important to not underestimate the amount of money it takes to bring your startup idea to life.\n\nYou need to ask yourself, how far can I get through my startup journey with what I have in the bank?\n\nIf like many entrepreneurs, you\u2019re not sitting on millions of dollars, you will arrive at the conclusion you need to raise some money.\n\nThe overarching question then becomes: where are you going to find that funding?\n\nIn today\u2019s landscape, investors won\u2019t give you money for a startup idea on a napkin.\n\nAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard, ideas are worth very little. Execution is what is valuable, and most investors know this.\n\nThen, besides the effort needed to pique their interest with just an idea on a napkin, there isn\u2019t much leverage you can use to avoid seeing a big chunk of equity going out the window. And you\u2019d later regret it.\n\nSo here are some ways you can bootstrap your startup:\n\n* Personal savings\n* A small business loan\n* Crowdfunding \u2014 on platforms such as Seedrs, Kickstarter or Indiegogo.\n* Investment from friends and family \u2013 usually for an equity stake in your startup or convertible note.\n\nThe next step is to do some research to ensure you can transform your startup idea into a solid product vision.\n\n# 3. Do Your Research\n\nThe next key step in bringing your idea to life is to make sure you build it for the person whose problem you\u2019re solving.\n\nAnother common mistake I see a lot is a founding team assuming they know what their users want.\n\nUsually, they end up very surprised when they\u2019re met with low adoption rates.\n\nRemember, the user is more demanding than ever. Focus not only on solving the problem but creating the best possible experience while doing it.\n\nFor this, you\u2019ll need to assess your stakeholders, competitors and the size of your market.\n\n***Stakeholder*** ***Analysis***\n\nNow you\u2019ve worked out the problem your startup idea will solve, it\u2019s time to look at the people you\u2019re solving it for.\n\nYou should describe them in terms of demographics, psychology, geography, observed behaviour and any other relevant factors.\n\nBy analysing your stakeholders you\u2019ll be able to discover crucial information that will help you shape the perfect user experience.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve analysed the stakeholders involved in your startup, it\u2019s time to look at the competition.\n\n***Competitor Benchmarks***\n\nThe next logical step in bringing your startup idea to life is to look at the other companies in your market currently solving the problem for your target stakeholder.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note here you should be looking at direct, indirect and potential competitors.\n\nYou should start by listing all your competitors. Then go into more detail to learn as much as possible about them by identifying their:\n\n* Value proposition;\n* Brand positioning;\n* Target group;\n* User base size;\n* Business model;\n* Yearly revenue;\n* Capital raised.\n\nThere are some useful tools out there to help you get started, here are some our product team recommends:\n\n* To learn about competitor revenue and capital raised: Statista, Crunchbase.\n* To discover the size of your competitors\u2019 user base: SimilarWeb.\n\nAlongside the above list, I recommend answering the following questions to gather even more information:\n\n* How long have they been on the market?\n* For startups: are they backed up by a big corporation? What were the latest investment rounds they underwent?\n* Which sales channels do they use?\n* Are they analogue or digital?\n* How are they reaching your target market?\n* What will you do to ensure your solution is better than the current market offering? How will you differentiate yourself from the alternatives?\n\nWith all this information in hand, identify your competitors\u2019 main strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThis will help you work out where your startup will fit in your competitive market.\n\nFinally, you should assess the size of your market.\n\n***Market Size***\n\nTo begin to get an idea of your market size, you should look specifically at three, simple factors:\n\n1. Total Available Market (TAM)\n2. Serviceable Available Market (SAM)\n3. Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)\n\nTo find statistics on the above, I recommend using tools like Statista &amp; Google Trends.\n\nBear in mind that the calculation of SOM is mainly based on your estimated potential to penetrate the market. At this stage of your startup journey, it\u2019s normal to not have a precise value in that category.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s good to start thinking about the market share you feel your startup idea could eventually obtain.\n\nWith your stakeholder analysis and competitor benchmarking in hand, you\u2019re ready for the next step:\n\n# 4. Transform Your Research Into an MVP Using a Proven Framework\n\nHaving looked outward at the market around you, it\u2019s now time to turn your gaze back inward to transform your startup idea into a set of user stories that are ready for development.\n\nIt starts with creating an elevator pitch to showcase your value proposition.\n\n***Crafting Your Value Proposition***\n\nHaving completed steps one and two, you\u2019re in a perfect position to craft your value proposition.\n\nYou simply need to combine:\n\n* Your target stakeholders\n* The problem they face\n* Your startup idea (a.k.a. your solution)\n* The key benefit your solution offers\n* Your competition\n* Why your solution is different/better than the current market offering\n\nHere is a template to help you get started:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_ (Name of your product) has been conceived for \\_\\_\\_\\_ (your stakeholders) who \\_\\_\\_\\_ (state their problem). \\_\\_\\_\\_ (Name of your product) is a\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (a statement of its key benefit/solution). Unlike \\_\\_\\_\\_ (the current solution) we \\_\\_\\_\\_ (say what differentiates you from the alternatives/your existing competition).\n\nIf your value proposition isn\u2019t crystal clear from your elevator pitch, you should look again at your target market, competition or even the problem you\u2019re trying to solve.\n\nIf your value proposition is crystal clear you can start looking at the assumptions surrounding your elevator pitch.\n\n***Defining Your Assumptions***\n\nYour value proposition is based on several assumptions. For example, you\u2019re assuming that users aren\u2019t happy with the current solution and need something more.\n\nMore than that, you\u2019re assuming that your startup idea is the key to fixing that.\n\nDeconstruct the statements from your elevator pitch/value proposition to find the most relevant assumptions.\n\nThen, revisit your research to identify which assumptions have already been validated by your stakeholders and competitors.\n\nFinally, identify which assumptions you will need to validate with an MVP and the KPIs you can use to measure them\n\nOnce you\u2019ve done that, you can start creating your feature list.\n\n***Building Your Feature List***\n\nThe last step in turning your startup idea into a scoped product vision is to create a feature list for your Minimum Viable Product (MVP).\n\nI recommend the MVP route to any entrepreneur setting out to build a tech startup. Building an MVP allows you to maintain a short time-to-market while gaining the maximum user feedback possible.\n\nTo build your feature list, you want to look at your assumptions and consider what feature is needed to prove (or disprove) it.\n\nIf you have an idea for a feature that doesn\u2019t directly help you validate your assumptions, it should be put aside. If your assumptions are proven, you can add extra features via iterations.\n\nDon\u2019t waste your money and importantly time on them at this stage.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve scoped your product, it\u2019s time to build it \u2013 and for that, you\u2019re going to need an extra pair of hands.\n\n# 5. Onboard the Right Team to Help You\n\nAs a non-technical founder, finding someone to help you build your product is one of the biggest barriers to bringing your startup idea to life.\n\nGenerally speaking, you have three options to build your startup product:\n\n1. Find a CTO or Tech Co-Founder\n2. Hire a freelance developer or two\n3. Reach out to a software development company\n\nMy advice here is if you can find a CTO or technical co-founder that\u2019s right for you, onboard them and never look back.\n\nWhich is not always easy.\n\nYou need to find someone who has an abundance of technical expertise, leadership and management skills.\n\nOn top of that, they have to be passionate about your startup idea and ready to commit 100% of their effort to it.\n\nFinally, you need to be able to communicate with ease and align on the critical factors that will affect your startup.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the other options.\n\nIf you are considering the freelancer path, make sure you know what you\u2019re signing up for. You will be the one in charge of managing them. This is a tall order for any non-technical entrepreneur.\n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t recommend this route unless you have prior experience managing tech teams.\n\nOn the other hand, software development companies will usually have a project manager in place to ensure the developers tasked with your project are hitting the milestones you laid out.\n\nThat being said, working with a software development company comes with a unique set of challenges as well.\n\nIf you choose to go down the agency route, do your due diligence and make sure you choose the right partner.\n\n# 6. Share Your Startup Idea as Much as Possible\n\nMany entrepreneurs are cautious about sharing their startup idea. The reason always being: \u201cif I share my idea, someone might steal it\u201d.\n\nThis, in my experience, is a mistake.\n\nYou should share your idea as much as possible to gather help and feedback.\n\nIdeas alone are worth nothing \u2013 it\u2019s the work you put into them that is valuable.\n\nPlus, you never know what you can gain by openly talking about your startup idea with the right people.\n\nIf you\u2019re on the fence with this one send a couple of Linkedin messages to successful founders and ask them about it. Not only will they say the exact same thing, but that will also validate most of what I\u2019ve said about this step.\n\n# 7. Target the Right Early Adopters\n\nBy now, you should already have narrowed down your target market to the people who are most affected by the problem you\u2019re solving.\n\nThis will make your go-to-market both more effective and less expensive.\n\nNow it\u2019s time to get out there and talk to them.\n\nI see many founders hide behind a brand that is yet to be created. They think that they need a flashy website, full of bells and whistles to attract early adopters. This is a fallacy.\n\nThe person who will be attracting, and ideally selling to early adopters is you, the founder.\n\nIn short:\n\nEarly adopters buy your vision, not your product.\n\nAt this stage, your product is at an MVP level. Without a doubt, there is still a lot of work to do to make it the best solution on the market.\n\nEarly adopters are investing in what your product will be, not what it is today.\n\nAnd the best person to sell them the vision is you \u2013 the person who has seen this from startup idea to early-stage product.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks for reading and good luck with your entrepreneurial journey.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone. I am currently working on a small software startup, that is most likely not going to make a lot of money (it is an opensource project with a freemium concept that is aiming to cover its server costs).\n\nI know that I need to setup TOS for my application, since it is dealing with user documents and similar. I have contacted an attorney who offered creating TOS for my company for \\~$700. I do not have a lot of start capital, and I could barely afford these $700, thus I am wondering if it is worth paying a professional this much, or if it would be reasonable to go for for a much cheaper alternative like fiverr, where I'd just pay \\~$100.\n\nI'd enjoy hearing your guy's opinions and experiences with this topic.  \nThanks for any advice in advance.",

From what you've shared it doesn't sound like you need a custom-built TOS, there are templatized services you can use to generate semi-custom TOS, and would be a lot cheaper. If you want to be super scrappy you can find a similar app/service to yours, copy it, and then make the adjustments/adaptations you need for your own case.",

            "comment": "My personal take is that it is not worth paying a lawyer for this until you start making real sales. Read some ToS from companies like Jira, ZoHo, Supabase, etc and see what they have done. Can you modify their terms to meet your needs?\n\nAlso, look at some generic ones.\n\nMain thing is to limit your liability and to give yourself the ability to change ther terms.\n\nAlso, consider having the terms be very skimpy until you find a paying customer and once you've got a sell coming in to pay for lawyer you can.",

This way I'd only pay \\~$120 and would still have a decent, even if probably not as good TOS.",

    "postText": "So I am starting a business where I feature and merchandise art on behalf of lesser known artists through a brand I have created. I plan to phase out artists and bring in new ones regularly and drop ship different merchandise featuring the current artists work.\n\nI need some help on how to structure this. I know I can use the brand as incentive and showcase the artist to help drive traffic to their personal platforms.\n\nBut how would I compensate them? Should they all receive royalties on whatever I sell? Should I pay for their designs outright? Do I enforce exclusivity of the designs used by my brand? What would be a good percentage of royalties for the artist if I choose that route?\nAny other advice for a business model ran like this?",

            "comment": "Generally, I talk to the artist and see what they\u2019re interested in. \n\nGenerally it\u2019s some mix of upfront payment and royalties. \n\nIt depends on the scope of the work. If it\u2019s a limited run, or set of original pieces (no reproductions) being purchased, I\u2019ll pay upfront. \n\nIf it\u2019s a design that will be reproduced, I\u2019ll pay them upfront for their time, and then there will be a royalty paid out, which is basically my way of paying the artist for exclusive use of that design (and also helps foster a better long term partnership). Royalty percentage is around 10% of the product price when we sell the item. This is also my preferred way because I don\u2019t have to feel bad if a product doesn\u2019t do as well as I expected because the artist has already been paid for their time. \n\nIf it\u2019s a collaboration, then there\u2019s usually just a royalty split, and I mean a genuine collaboration, where both myself and the other artist are working on a design and the production of the end products together, sometimes I\u2019ll consider a royalty only deal (usually a like 20-30%), but it\u2019s rare.",

            "comment": "Some artists might already have their desired pay advertised on their platforms including comercial usecases. IMO Pay x amount now and y% of every order you get during the showcase. Will put additional incentive for them to promote your merch with their art, just like tshit and cup self promotion adds you see everywhere. \n\nThink x and y would be proportional to your business size. For example if you starting out you can pay their commision rates and 90% of the markup to the artist, when you're larger you can offer $5k and 10% of the markup",

            "comment": "Discuss with the artist to about the Commercial Usage of the art. This is can usually be read from the artist's Terms of Service (I have it in mine) but it's better to discuss it with the artist themselves for clarification \ud83d\udc4d. Here's some basic questions to hopefully guide you:\n\n(1) Who will own the art?\n\n(2) Can I edit the art work? If yes, to what degree?\n\n(3) What specific commercial uses does the artist allows?\n\n\\- The specific use of their art would be a factor on how some artist set their commercial prices. Example, an art work to be printed on shirts would have a different price compared to art works for NFT use\n\nI hope this provides you guidance. Good luck and I wish for your success \ud83d\ude0a",

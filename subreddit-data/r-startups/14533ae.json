I now have meetings with few stores and i don't know how much should i commission them for every sale they get through my website? I was thinking maybe 10% sounds logical any thoughts?",

Just the initial connection, or also storefront (inventory management, purchasing flow, payment processing, etc.), protections (buyer and seller protections), and so on?\n\nOn the high end, app stores charge 30% but they provide a significant amount of functionality and visibility. On the lower end, Square charges $30/month + 3-4% of every transaction, and also builds in a ton of functionality for that price. \n\nIn short, what are you providing that justifies 10%? How much are you increasing their revenue in ways they wouldn't already be capable of doing?",

Make the commission high, get your reps stoked to go out there and kill it. \n\nOnce you have confidence in the model and product, you can refine your commission plan. \n\nAs one who has been there before, it\u2019s not worth stressing over this right now if you do t have a real business. Once you start worry about your reps making too mu can money because you\u2019re actually cutting big checks, you\u2019re in a good place and you can refine your plan later.",

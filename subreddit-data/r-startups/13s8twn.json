Sure anyone can scrap up a few hundred bucks but clearly that\u2019s nothing compared to startups with funding. \n\nSlight context of the business: \nIt is a platform for people who provide a service to be found in a smart and efficient way. So it\u2019s profitable for type A users to be on it. And it\u2019s convenient for types B users to use it. \n\nIt\u2019s a business we\u2019ve tested in the real world and gotten feedback from both types of users that it works and solves a problem for each.",

            "comment": "If I had zero money (and yes, that's actually the case) I would start my marketing efforts with these steps:\n\n1. Find where your audience hangs out online, today.\n2. Listen to their online conversations and try to find places where they openly talk about their problems, or where they share tips/tricks to help each other.\n3. Answer their questions, suggest tips how they can solve their problems.\n4. When you get good feedback, write a longer article about how to solve one particular problem of theirs. Put a link to that article into your next answer.\n5. Use UTM parameters to track where the most visitors of that link come from.\n6. Double down on the particular place where the most visitors are coming from. Over time, you will be seen as the \"go-to\" source for problem X.\n7. Make a platform that solves problem X thoroughly and repeatably. Tell the audience about the new platform, because it will help them.\n8. Go back to the earlier steps, refine your messages, and repeat until more and more success.\n\nThis avoids spending money for the old, expensive, and (today) ineffective forms of \"interruption style\" marketing, like paid ads, billboards or TV spots. It turns marketing into helping people. It only costs your time, and you'll be rewarded with motivation and energy to go ahead.",

Nothing beats having a list of potential customers who are interested in what you\u2019re doing and (at least a little) invested in your success. \n\nOP, I wish you luck. Marketplace startups are notoriously difficult to get rolling because you\u2019ve got to get two very different types of users on your platform (folks offering the service and folks who are looking for services) and neither one wants to be there if the other isn\u2019t.  Classic chicken/egg problem. Not impossible but makes /u/bohlenlabs advice even more poignant - the shotgun approach won\u2019t work, you need to invest the time and highly target, even if you had a ton of money to spend on acquisition",

            "comment": "I'd urge you to not overlook earned media. If you take the time to do the work, there are a lot of reporters looking for article ideas. And nothing moves the needle quite like a story in a major news outlet.\n\nEarned media is much more art than science. Relationships with media help tremendously, but the most important elements are:\n\n**==Be honest, clear, and objective about your value prop==**    \n\nNever, never, EVER pitch a reporter a promotional angle. No reporter worth their salt is going to write a goddamn ad for you. If you want paid media, buy paid media. It's called *earned* media for a reason. It needs to benefit and inform (even delight) the reader.\n\nSo take your founder hat off for a moment and consider honestly: what would an average person (who had never heard of you) think is cool or interesting about what you're doing? Not something about the company itself but about what you are doing for your customers. Strip away all the marketing BS and drill down into the essence of what you are doing for people and how it impacts them or changes their lives. Another way of saying this is: look at your company from the outside in, not from the inside out. See your company in context of the world, not the world in context of your company. \n\nYou don't have to be curing cancer to find something valuable and interesting here.\n\nThis is much easier if you're B2C than B2B but it's still doable as a B2B. I led marcomm for a couple B2Bs (one startup and one behemoth) so I know it's much harder as a \"vendor\" but if you think about the benefits you deliver from the perspective of the ultimate end beneficiary it can really get the ideas flowing, especially if your direct customer will play ball in your earned media efforts.\n\nWhich gets me to...\n\n**==Enlist your customers==**\n\nNot everyone likes getting media attention, but a lot of people and organizations see the value in it, especially if they don't have to do a lot of work.\n\nOnce you've come up with some stories/angles, ask your customers if they'd be willing to talk to a reporter as part of your \"customer media program\". It's free publicity - yet another benefit of being one of our valued customers! Be clear with them that you do not expect them to shill for you. This is not promotional material. You just want them to tell their story (which you've already helped identify and assemble).\n\nAnd finally:\n\n**==Targeting Media==**\n\n*All of the above MUST be heavily informed by / tailored to this part or it will fail and also harm your future ability to pitch that reporter.*\n\nOnce you have identified some stories and angles, a handful of appropriate media outlets ought to naturally come to mind. But push yourself to think outside the box. You might not have a *BusinessWeek* cover story, but you'd be surprised how well you can do if you're great at telling a story. For example, business reporters for affiliate TV stations in major metros are always looking for a cool new story if it has a link to the region. They get fewer good pitches than you'd think. \n\nBut be brutally honest with yourself about where something fits. Trying to force something will only get you shitlisted for when you have something that really does fit.\n\nOnce you've homed in on outlets, find the right reporter. You'll do this by looking through that outlet for stories with similar themes or audiences.\n\nNever pitch multiple reporters at the same outlet simultaneously. If the first one ignores you or says no, it's OK to move on, but be sure to tell the next one that you pitched the first one without luck/response/whatever.\n\nThe most important thing is knowing the individual reporter and their beat. Do not screw this up! \n\nResearch their prior work, areas of interest and work this into your approach. The #1 way a reporter will ignore you forever is if you pitch them on something they have no interest in and no history covering.\n\nWhen you have all this, reach out to them with an individual, personal email. Never, never, ever mass-email reporters.\n\nExample (admittedly ridiculous but you'll get the drift I hope)\n\n&gt;Dear Winfred,\n\n&gt;I really enjoyed your piece last month about the FDA's new guidance on child-resistant packaging. It's astonishing how such a seemingly minor administrative decision can impact so many families and literally save lives.\n\n&gt;Since reading your article I've been meaning to reach out to you. Our company makes biometric child locks for medicine cabinets, and we recently had three different customers send us home surveillance videos of their small children trying to get into their medicine cabinets while the adults were asleep. Luckily in these cases, potential tragedies were avoided.\n\n&gt;If you're ever working on a story on the subject, I'd be glad to put you in touch with those customers. Based on my casual conversations with them, I'm confident at least two of them would be willing to share their stories (and videos) with you.\n\n&gt;Either way, if I can ever be a resource for you on the subject, feel free to reach out.\n\n&gt;Founder    \n&gt;Company    \n&gt;Cell Phone    \n\nThere you go! You've now completed Earned Media 098 for startup founders.\n\nOh, P.S.: Don't overlook \"expert source\" media opps. These are awesome. These are when a reporter is just looking for color/perspective on another story they're doing. A third-party expert. You see this in stories almost constantly. this all the time. They're about an industry trend, breaking news event, another company, or whatever, and the reporter needs some \"meat on the bones\" from someone who knows the space but isn't connected to the subject(s) of the story. These really boost your cred and help build a relationship with reporters if you're helpful and responsive (it really helps if you're great at sound bites) and they are usually quite tight deadlines/last-minute. These are often emailed but sometimes (such as with TV) are done as \"remotes\". Giving good remotes is another post entirely.",

I had thought on using either a CRM or a tool like Notion or Evernote but I was wondering if anyone had a better idea...  \nThanks!",

            "comment": "Depends how big the company is but I guarantee your top management does not want their TFNs (tax numbers) sitting in Notion or Evernote.\n\nIf the company has 20+ employees then you should store your human resource information in a HRIS.\n\nIf you have OKRs and track goals against them there are some good OKR tools (most HRIS systems have some OKR functionality too).\n\nFor passwords, tax numbers, and any other sensitive information, you should use something like 1password which lets you share and disseminate that information with the right people.\n\nFor projects and issues you can use whatever suits your business. Jira is the standard for SaaS by a large margin.\n\nPick the right tool for each type of information, trying to do everything in one tool will leave you with something that does nothing particularly well.",

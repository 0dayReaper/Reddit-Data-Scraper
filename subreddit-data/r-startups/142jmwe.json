    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nFinally I have made a prototype of an idea i've had for a while. IT feels awesome but i've also come to a point where it doesn't make sense to continue developing the product before i get some validation and feedback from real people.\n\nI have list of people i'm going to message \u2013 but to be honest i'm lacking a bit of motivation because there is a high risk that no one will answer. My plan is basically to cold message people on twitter that would be interested in my product.\n\nI'm looking for a better approach. Do you have any other tips? Outside the box ideas? Are there any resources to do this better? Should i maybe try to advertising? Thanks in advance :)",

When you're more or less chatting, you can ask him \"is it okay if I ask you a few questions about that?\"\n\nAfter 1-2 questions, it will be pretty easy to negotiate an interview with him. Eventually after all that, offer a demo of your product.\n\nThat way the person will consistently warm up. Yes, it looks a little complicated, but it will all help you find loyal people, you'll also learn a lot of useful information along the way.\n\nGood luck!",

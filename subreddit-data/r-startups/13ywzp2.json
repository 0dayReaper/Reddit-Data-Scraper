If not let me know. \n\nThat aside some feedback. \n\nPositive: \n-i love general layout design of mobile site. Im on iphone safari. \n-estimation is a pain point universally felt by pms and engineering. A lot of us are convinced its a waste of time so anything to speed up refinement sessions would be WELCOME. \n\nFeedback:\n-the landing page hero text tells me nothing about your product. Revolutionizing engineering is far to broad and way to lofty to catch my attention. Your purpose stated above caught my attention. Replacing it with \u201cassist development\u2026. Process\u201d from above would be far better. There could even be a better tagline than that. \n-screenshots of product filling stuff in are way to small. I was squinting to see and after 3rd small screenshot gave up. Maybe consider a video of how it would work?\n-spending 2-3 minutes on the site which is about how long i give a new site to sell me before im clicking out of there i have learned you use ai to improve estimation but zero idea how. I could have missed it but if i did im sure a large portion of population do as well. \n\nWhats the elevator pitch? \nAlso i know my pain points with estimation but id encourage selling that as well. Talk about the frustration and wasted time. \n\n-no pricing page? How much does it cost? If there is no pricing im out. I know this is early but still. \n\n-how would integrations work with devops or jira? As a pm i dont want to have to deal with getting integration tokens or whatever. Especially large companies its a pain in the ass. How can i start using this tomorrow? \n\nOverall i think you are on to something good here and happy to chat more and do beta testing.",

I agree, the landing page still needs some work and your feedback is valid. Currently we do have a \"pricing\" section under FAQ, however since the pricing model is not fully finished yet we don't have a page dedicated to it. Once we do, it will be on its own separate page. As far as integrations, we're trying our best to make this as smooth as possible. We want pms and developers to easily transfer their existing data into Sprixl in seconds. Overall, thanks so much for reviewing, I appreciate your feedback. I also DMed you",

Yes, I agree with you, not every online employee or calendar user will have this issue, only the ones with multiple active email addresses and calendars, therefore, only they will be experiencing the problem around having a main calendar that would be blocking the booked slots in the other existing calendars. \n\nIf I have to answer it in 1 sentence, it would be any online employee/ multiple calendar owner that wants to manage their schedule without any problems and the fear of missing out or double booking their events. \n\nAdditionally, I suggest that you take a look at the scheduling tool, mainly so the you will better understand the double booking issue as well as the real advantage of the syncing feature.\n\nOnce again, thank you very much for your reply!",

How can you target him / her by marketing... do you know what differentiates people with multiple calendars and those with one or 2?\n\nI feel that is really important question for you to answer. Since you will not have viable marketing targeting general public - I susspect too low conversion rate ... try first before you take my feeling ...  \nBut lets asume it is true, Find one group of people who have much higher chance to have this problem and you have a business case.

But that being said, with a good facilitator it can easily be done and I can even send you recordings of such sessions if interested.\n\nFurther more having just everyone to input their ideas without any refinement and consolidation will produce just bunch of mess ... I guess you could send an AI to make it smoother.\n\nI feel a big potential for collaborative sessions like brainstorming is asynchronous sessions, people are all over the world, you have co/works from 3 different places and finding the same time becomes an issue. Make it time limited and asynchronous.",

Of course this is a matter of opinion so it's up to you how you want it to look. Another thing I found worrisome is that you have to be a subscriber to see your past brainstorms. As a user if my team and I spend 10 minutes brainstorming a solution or idea, I expect to be able to re-visit that. Especially if the selected idea did not work, I'd like to go back and see the alternative solutions. In general there are a lot of brainstorming apps, so I think you will have a lot of competition, especially because a lot of the alternatives are free.   \n\n\nHowever, on a more positive note I think you did a pretty great implementation of your idea. The app is easy to use and could be a valuable asset to a team. I guess if I had any advice I'd suggest allowing free users access to more features, especially if you are competing against a pretty saturated market that offers a lot of free alternatives.",

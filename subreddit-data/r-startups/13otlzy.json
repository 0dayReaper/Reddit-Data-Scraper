    "postText": "Hi all.\n\nI started working at a small software start up as a customer support agent. The job description described pretty normal duties. Interacting with customers and communicating their issues to the right people.\n\nTurns out the software is still in production and my job is actually going through the software reporting bugs + suggesting features. Things I have been suggesting are getting built , and some I've even mocked up which is cool but... seems like a way different job and I didn't negotiate my salary based on this role.\n\nI feel like I am  creating the product much more directly. In your opinion - Are/should both of those jobs be comparable in salary or much different?",

            "comment": "First of all, how \"small\" of a startup are we talking about? If the company is really small (like, less than 20 people) I think that you shouldn't be too concerned about the accuracy of the job description, just enjoy your extended responsibilities and the impact you'll have on the product. Keep your manager in the loop about what you're doing and I'm sure you will be rewarded and fast-tracked with promotions/salary raises if the company manages to scale up.",

Small like -  20 -30 remote staff of contractors + full time  + Dev  This software has had one previous iteration that released in 2018 with lots of problems and maintains around 1000 customers today.  The software we are currently working on is the upgrade new version of that past software with a lot of changes and new features.",

If you want to work at a company with a clearly defined role that doesn\u2019t shift - don\u2019t work at a startup. Work at a larger company. \n\nSmall companies and startups are ever shifting and changing.  Their value is not in stasis, but the opportunity to jump in and do different things. That doesn\u2019t mean it is toxic. But if you don\u2019t want that work somewhere else.",

They would be transparent and thoughtful enough to allow potential candidates to make an informed decision about working for them.\n\nCompetent people would expand on what that may mean during the interview process.\n\nCompetent people would ensure the candidate fully understood the situation and was excited about the additional roles.\n\nCompetent people would continuously check in with the new hire to confirm they are still excited and handling those additional roles. They would provide training and mentorship for those additional roles to help the new hire acclimate, grow, and enjoy working there.\n\nThat is what competent people would do.

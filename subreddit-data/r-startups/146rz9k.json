This feeling of\u2026 **effortlessness**. Sometimes things just come to us, it doesn\u2019t always have to be an uphill race, an endless grind.\n\n**\u201cI wish every day would start like this\u201d**. (I\u2019m assuming this is what went through the mind of whoever invented \u201cpartner marketing\u201d, and was overtaken by motivation to figure out how to make that happen).\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing with partner programs: as opposed to a random referral from time to time, a partner program is designed to systematically bring in loads of relevant leads, in a predictable way that allows you to set goals, and gives you the control to adjust course if the goals aren\u2019t met.\n\nHere\u2019s another thing about pratner programs: the **ROI** on them is **insane**. But impore importantly: if you invest in building one when you **CAN**, it will serve you well on rainy days, when spending on marketing is hard, or when the sales department is going through a rough time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s discuss how partner programs gets you so many great leads or customers:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Figure out who has a relationship with the target audience you\u2019re selling to.\n\nHere are 2 great exmaples:\n\n    A. HubSpot CRM has a community of accelerators and VC's. The idea is being the obvious choice for the startups that they work with.\n    \n    B. Intercom, a CS chat bot SaaS, offers CRM implementors a commission to recommend theirsoftware (I actually signup because the person who implemented HubSpot for me recommended it).\n\n2. Incentivize them to refer clients, by offering a commission for referrals\\*\n\n3. Train them to sell your product.\n\n4. Follow-up consistently and motivate them to keep referring people.\n\n5. Motivate them consistently.Personally, as a fractional CMO, I\u2019m often approached and offered a commission to have my clients use a certain software or choose a certain maerkting agency, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\ud83d\udca1 Take a minute to think about it - who could get a lot of qualified leads for your clients?\n\nHave an idea? Perfect.\n\n(if you don\u2019t - comment below with some details and let's brainstorm as a group).\n\n(or hmu for brainstorming if you don't wanna do it publicly).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking a commission is enough motivation to get partners to prioritize your client and start referring everyone they know.A good partners program will:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Get partners joining the program consistently\n* Have a smart compensation model - not just commissions.\n* A smart commission structure (one that will allow them to see how they can make a lot of money and turn this into a serious revenue channel - perhaps their biggest, but will also allow for quick wins so they don\u2019t get burnt out and quit).\n* Educate partners so they can get the right leads, and do so in a way that is aligned with the company values.\n* (Somtimes) foster a community of ambassadors/evangelists\n* Motivate the partners to activly refer people, and keep doing it.\n* Operate with transparency and allow partners to know the status of their referral without asking about it every otehr day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe steps of building a great partners program:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Identify the best partners, and what their intereste would be in referring leads (other than just the commission).\n2. Create an offer. Just like selling a product or a service, build a great offer, and a \u201csales\u201d page where partners sign up and commit to the program. Some companies charge for this btw.\n3. Set up a tracking system (personally I love Everflow, but look up some competitors and compare).\n4. Build a smart onboarding proccess for tha partners, to orient them with the proccess, and provide basic training so they can actually do the work and earn money.\n5. Motivate them on a weekly basis, follow up, set goals for them, consider competitions and other incentives. A newsletter is a great idea, and in some cases a Slack community or something similar. Share success stories, arm them with \u201cammunition\u201d - an elevator pitch script, marketing materials, out-of-the-box ideas to get more leads, etc.\n\nNot sure how to end this post, just hope it helps someone.\n\nFeel free to ask questions in the comments.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve come up with a marketable outdoors product that does not exist by itself, but it does as individual components put together. I have a nice preliminary business plan and product sketches. I have a degree in accounting and work in auditing, so I understand the financial/legal fundamentals of business. Recent college grad, 70k annual salary, first \u2018real\u2019 business.\n\nI have the product idea sketched out and well researched, but my problem is: \n\n1) Product Design/Engineering: If my product idea involves electronics, moving parts, and overall engineering beyond my capabilities, is it advisable to go to a product design company to develop the product? I know of the benefits of MFD and think that is where the value would come from of the $18,000 quote I got from a reputable company, Mako Design. I have built a functional works-good/looks-good model made from parts I\u2019ve purchased from Amazon.\n\n2) Pricing/Financials/COGS: The above $18,000 quote was for design only with CAD drawings, etc. This did not include a BOM or cost sheet or anything. I was hoping it would because that would make it so that I could start with the financial aspect of the business plan, making sure the product could theoretically be profitable. How do I come up with cost details with a product like this? Is going to a product design firm whose next step, after the $18,000 bill, would be to come up with the materials, costs, and overall engineering specifics, as opposed to the general framework provided in the $18k, worth it?\n\n3) Funding: Would it be foolish to take out a business loan to aid in bringing the product to a prototype stage? The quote was $100k ballpark figure to get it there. I know it\u2019s steep, but at the end of the day, wouldn\u2019t this be the part the is most deserving of funding?\n\nAny help is appreciated, rather that\u2019s a comment, a website, book suggestion, etc. I am very lost in this process of actually making the product come to a manufacturing stage.",

            "comment": "Hi there - I've been building/launching/scaling physical products (electronic and non-electronic) for about 15 years. It's hard to say really anything precisely or definitively without having a basic understanding of the product scope.\n\nThat said, it's really (mostly) as simple as this: If you don't have the capability to design/engineer/prototype a product mostly yourself or with other members of the company, doing so with a firm will be a significant cost, especially if you've never done this before. It's totally viable to do it this way and honestly probably the safer bet that would more likely result in a sound product with few issues. \n\nI'm also honestly not sure what you're getting for the 18k - when first read it, I was thrown by how little that was. But then you said that's basically just a design (how detailed is unclear). But to actually PROVE the design via prototyping, testing and a final design package is separate and likely to cost 100k or more. These numbers are impossible to gauge without knowing the scope of the product, but I think they're reasonable estimates. \n\nThe question is what is the 18k actually buying you? You've already mocked something up something that \"works good looks good\" so is the 18k just a feasibility study or just some polish to the concept?\n\nInstead of writing a book I'll say this: launching a physical product (again, product complexity really matters here) can be done either by knowing how to design/test/proto yourself or spending lots of money. It really comes down to the confidence level you have in the product.\n\nMy advice would be to take your prototype you already have and show it to people. Get honest, raw feedback. Build or erode your confidence and then take the next step. If you're really confident and people genuinely seem to like it, I would try to find a technical co-founder or raise some pre-seed capital, rather than taking a loan. \n\nThere's a ton of different ways to go about this and it's very \"chicken/egg\". I'd be happy to take a look at it for you (but totally understand if that's too scary), and could give you some estimates on what the various paths would cost, estimate the product COGS for you, startup costs, etc. \n\nAnd just keep in mind - building the product is only maybe 1/3 of the job. \"Build it and they will come\" is not a thing. Inventory, cash flow, sales channel, customer acquisition, website building etc are all equally as difficult or more so depending on your experience level. So don't get yourself in debt just yet. Avoid spending money for as long as possible, unless you're just slam dunk confident about the idea and your ability to bring it to market.  \n\n\n* Validate the idea with your peer group or better yet strangers\n* Maybe build a pre-order site that sells the product (but then refunds them the money or never takes money) to see if you can actually get people to buy the concept\n* Find a partner who can compliment your skillset or raise capital\n* Then develop the product depending on which path you choose\n\nHope this helps - happy to help further if desired - good luck!",

            "comment": "I founded an outdoor and sporting goods company that expanded from retail to wholesale, and eventually in-house product development for our retail channels. I was lucky to exit after 6 years, leaving behind a healthy business because most competitors that got their start around the same time as I did no longer exist. It's a tough market and the adoption of a new color SKU is challenging to accomplish, much less a totally new product.   \n\n\nBefore we launched our retail experience, we spent a solid year on deep research to ensure that we understood all of the pains of our stakeholders and how best to formulate a solution. This is one of the slowest-moving industries when it comes to online sales adoption and that means that the DTC audience is drastically smaller than most other verticals. With such a challenging outlook, it may help to get some feedback from buyers and those actively operating in a brick-and-mortar retail setting.  \n\n\nWhen it comes to design, you can get it done much cheaper with a freelancer or other means. However, it may be better to have a prototype made in accordance with a CAD file. The reason for this is that when it comes down to prototyping if done at a separate firm, they will undoubtedly have to make alterations to the file, which won't be free or inexpensive, in addition to the manufacturing process. I don't know what you're building, but if possible, I'd encourage you to look into some print farms and connect with a reputable 3D printer.  \n\n\nFinally, don't take out a loan. You've done no research, you don't understand the commercial prospects and your strategy for dev, and of course, GTM doesn't seem to be in order. While you may very well have a promising product on your hands, if you don't know what you're doing, you could end up with nothing more than a 100K paperweight. In opposition to literature, I think you may get more use out of watching some long-form youtube videos on product development. However, if you're serious about this, you'll have to understand that this is a process that requires a number of skilled individuals to carry out specialized roles. You need to first learn what those roles are, specific to your product.",

Start by outlining your vision, target market, competitive analysis, and marketing strategies. Include financial projections, such as revenue forecasts, expenses, and funding requirements, to demonstrate the viability of your venture. Ensure your business plan reflects a solid understanding of your manufacturing or product design process. Conduct thorough research to identify the most efficient and cost-effective manufacturing methods. Create detailed product design specifications, considering aesthetics, functionality, and market demand. Collaborate with engineers and designers to prototype and refine your product. Align your financials with your manufacturing and product design strategies to showcase a realistic and profitable business model.",

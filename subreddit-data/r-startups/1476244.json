    "postText": "Hi Everyone, I am the founder of an Apparel Company based on a Technical fashion product that I have patented (utility). I have engineered a Jacket that offers 2 jacket styles, a tote, a pillow and some styles a blanket. \n\nWe offer a Windbreaker version and a Puffer version. All of our designs are super stylish and are offered in sizes S-5X. We started selling D2C December 2022 and have done daily well (just under $200K) from everything being bootstrapped by me, no paid ads. \n\nWe have also had a lot of viral success on Instagram and TikTok. But I am now at the point to where I need assistance, advisory, funding or a path to licensing opportunities. I have reached out to everyone in my network and outside of it and have had no luck at all. \n\nI already do not come from a background where anyone has done anything even remotely close in my family or friend group. We have a very low burn rate but would like to at least gain some advisory that can lead to licensing opportunities but due to having no direct connection my attempts at \u201ccold\u201d reaching on on linked in have not been successful. \n\nHas anyone experienced this ? Have any advice or points to offer? Would be greatly appreciated, thank you in advance!",

I\u2019m not on LinkedIn to have other people hassle me 3-5 times per day with how great their investment opportunity is or why I need them.  Seriously, don\u2019t dm people on LinkedIn.  See if you have contacts that know them.  Network slowly.\n\nAlways concentrate on sales and growth with good products.\n\nAlways go through the process with local angel groups and angels who have a formal process.  Don\u2019t try to cut the line with investors.",

            "comment": "Some options:\n\nLook for Angel groups in your city. Google it. Word of caution is that their deals can be pretty crummy.\n\nLook for similar apparel companies/brands that have gotten angel or VC investment in the past. Crunchbase is your friend, it\u2019s worth upgrading to get all the data access. Then look at the angels that invested in those companies and reach out via LinkedIn. Angels typically invest within their domain of interest or experience.\n\nAnother option is to look at an accelerator. There are many out there but only few good ones. YCombinator, Techstars, OnDeck, 500 Startups. This was our path, and since then all our investor pitches including our last VC round was through warm intros to partners at VCs.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t waste your time with pleasantries and chatting about your business with possible \u201cangels\u201d. Qualify their appetite for investment right upfront - ask what their typical check size is. This is business.\n\nGood luck!",

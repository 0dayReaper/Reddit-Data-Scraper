Aka, an early round for angels to fund you until you get to a point where you feel comfortable pitching to the bigger fish (VCs), or, if you're very lucky/good, until you don't need outside money anymore. \n\nAs someone who has added \"fool\" to my resume, I'm always happy to hear what you (and other people as well) are working on, and if it's compelling, to introduce you to the other \"fools\" I know.",

I will be CTO/Co-founder.\n\nSeems serious, well connected in Sales.\n\nI know him, he is a friend of a friend, wants to invest in efforts to sell the solution to Customers, has contacts and channels.\n\nLittle bit worried about a 51% to 49% split, if he does not deliver and is not in the long term.\n\nHow to tackle options to take him onboard but with less risks?\n\nMaybe 51:49% profit sharing and 25% of the company, or later with time increase to 49% (as option)\n\nWhat do others suggest?\n\nWhat is typical?\n\nWhat to look out for?\n\nP.S That is the only partner inquiry I have and want to co-found company with me (we are also in the same city, friend of the friend)\n\n**Update:**\n\nThank you for the amazing tips.\n\nTo give you more idea:\n\nIt is B2B software with ticket size 2.5-5k-10k per small business/per year, enterprises many more\n\nSolution is ready, 10k downloads (last year), interests from companies globally and also big public sector, also individuals at 499 per year and 49 per month\n\nHowever, with all that I could not convert any sales (suck at it maybe, missing biz foundation like properly grounding)\n\nPartner promises formal company grounding, sales, distribution channels, business operations (on which seems I suck)\n\nIt will start local vs local companies, via network. I don't have it (expat here)\n\nI am sure we will get Customers and the value will appear (valuation)\n\nNow it seems null, my idea, year of work and running costs and promotions (which I could not profit from, lack of sales skills/concept)\n\nI worked at similar startup, and they with few ppl and worse idea were valuated at several millions, also got investments in million amount (for much worser solution that I have now)\n\nThis is so far the only serious person, I kind of now to approach me.",

Standard is 4 year vesting period with a 1 year cliff, i.e. if things don't work out in the first year and you decide not to work together any more, the company is protected.\n\nIf you take ever take VC money they will insist on this, and often the vesting clock will reset every time you raise a round.",

Future value will depend on growth and your future effort and his. You can split the value of that and set up vesting for you both. \n\nSo for a simple example, if your company is worth $1mln now, that's the 100% you own. He's worth $500k and you are $500k, for a post of $2mln. Thus he owns 25% and you own 75%. His 25% vests over 4 years (with 1 yr cliff). Of your 75%, you own 50% outright and 25% vests.",

Do they convert? Do they keep using it? Is it solving their problem?\n\nIn the second, contact your users, and ask them why they didn\u2019t sign up? Start building an understanding of your user behavior, and work to fix the product to do what users thought it would do when they signed up. \n\nOnce you can get some sales, THEN I\u2019d start thinking about bringing on a partner. In this instance, 50/50 or anything close doesn\u2019t feel fair to you, as you\u2019d have done all of the groundwork to establish the company. I\u2019d probably do something closer to 60/40 or 70/30, since the company hasn\u2019t been totally derisked yet, but you\u2019ve done a ton of the work. \n\nIf you want a partner just so you feel like you\u2019re not alone, then that\u2019s another story, and in that instance, it\u2019s totally going to be up to what you feel good about.",

He'll have to be able to figure out the problems your people need solved and be able to communicate those adjustments to you.   \n\n\nFinally, there's no substitute for the creator to be selling. Bill Gates was the only sales person for Mircosoft for YEARS, Steve Jobs was the same way, same for James Dyson, Walt Disney, Estee Lauder... You built this because you see a future for your customer that no one else can see, that belief will sell more of your product than anything.   \n\n\nSales is communication &amp; belief, communication is just like programming, there are systems and processes that you can learn to get better at it, I'd invest some time in getting better at this, I'm not saying you have to do it all or learn it all, but being comfortable selling is very important!",

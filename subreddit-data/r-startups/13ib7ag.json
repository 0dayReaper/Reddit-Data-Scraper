    "postText": "I'm a web developer and I launched my startup 3 months ago. I'm running google ads but I'm almost out of cash so I started looking for a job. My startup is a social platform so it requires a lot of network effect to get traction and to get that, I estimate I would need to spend 10x the amount I'm currently spending on acquiring users.\n\nI applied to 400+ jobs and I got 2-3 interviews and nothing else.\n\nI'm a mid level developer and quite paradoxically I had more interviews and luck when I had literally no experience but just a few fake projects on my website. Is this the market or what?\n\nI hope this doesn't get removed as I'm sure there are many other people in my situation right now. I'm based in Europe.\n\nShould I get a normal job? Feels bad let me tell you. To go from CEO to a job at the lower-end of the market. Seems like a movie scene. ",

            "comment": "I hear you. Years ago, I was in the same situation.\n\nStarted a company, bootstrapped by teaching university students in large cohorts (which could have turned into a pretty good business itself) and taking on data science consulting gigs. Had a team of 3 developers which I paid for using the money I earned. Company didn't work out after a year and half. Same kind of business as yours (social/network effect) and did not have any revenue.\n\nThen went on to work in the corporate world. 5 years later, I started another company. Used the same name and logo so it felt like a resurrection. Now we are doing $2m+ in revenue and 10+ people.\n\nShort answer is nobody can you tell what do to next. We don't know your situation and we can't evaluate for you. But if you are asking this question, chances are it's not working and you should move on. First time for me, everyday I asked should I continue or should I go find a job. This time around, I never even think about this question.\n\nAnd yes, to go from CEO to a job at the lower-end of the market does not feel good. I used to tell people what to do and now it's the other way around. But stepping out of the venture world gives you a fresh perspective on things. Try to join a company in the same space so you can learn what went wrong. There is always another chance a few years later.\n\nAnd lastly, I would proud put my startup experience on my revenue. Yes, it wasn't a million dollar exit or anything brilliant, but I learned valuable things that made me a better person and the employers appreciated the unique experience.",

But like the other comment said, I proudly put my startup experience up. And in my perspective (and I\u2019ve had 5 years of career counseling experience), being founders makes us look more\u2026eccentric, not obedient, and might not be able to endure the more \u201clabor\u201d side of working in a corporate - which, in my eyes, are all good qualities that everyone should have, and all bad flaws that corporate culture should fix! \n\nI read somewhere that startup founders are odd and stand out too much in a corporate environment, and I agree. Most of my former colleagues do not understand why I would take so much risk for a mission-led task instead of considering its ROI. \n\nAll in all, I want to say to you my fellow founder also submitting resumes everywhere: I feel ya! I\u2019m the same. I think market IS bad at the moment and it\u2019s not our fault. And the slightest chance it DOES affect our resume, is because we don\u2019t look like obedient slavery-labor to average employers, and that\u2019s a good thing :)",

You can pivot, you can change the product, you can lose cofounders. But the commitment must be there.\n\nPS: I'm building sth similar. What kind of platform you are building? Who is it built for?

This is unrealistic for most--there is no way for them to survive going all in for 2 years without earning elsewhere.\n\nMost should not rush to go all in on their startup until it makes sense--they have built up the business enough to pay their own salary.  That requires building up the business in a very calculated and strategic manner that does not lead to overinvesting, overspending, or overpromising.",

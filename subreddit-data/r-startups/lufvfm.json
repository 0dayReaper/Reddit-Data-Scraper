    "postText": "Paul Graham wrote an essay in 2009, \"Startups in 13 sentences\"\n\nIts filled with nuggets of startup wisdom like:\n\n\"It's better to make a few people really happy than to make a lot of people semi-happy.\"\n\nA summary of an already short-essay:\n\n## 1. Pick good cofounders.\n\nCofounders are for a startup what location is for real estate.\n\nYou can change anything about a house except where it is.\n\nIn a startup you can change your idea easily, but changing your cofounders is hard.\n\n\n## 2. Launch fast.\n\nThe reason to launch fast is not so much that it's critical to get your product to market early, but that you haven't really started working on it till you've launched.\n\nLaunching teaches you what you should have been building.\n\n\n## 3. Let your idea evolve.\n\nThis is the second half of launching fast. Launch fast and iterate.\n\nIt's a big mistake to treat a startup as if it were merely a matter of implementing some brilliant initial idea.\n\nAs in an essay, most of the ideas appear in the implementing.\n\n## 4. Understand your users.\n\nYou can envision the wealth created by a startup as a rectangle, where one side is the number of users and the other is how much you improve their lives.\n\nThe second dimension is the one you have most control over.\n\n\nThe growth in the first will be driven by how well you do in the second.\n\nThe hard part is seeing something new that users lack. The better you understand them the better the odds of doing that.\n\nThat's why so many successful startups make something the founders needed\n\n\n## 5. Better to make a few users love you than a lot ambivalent.\n\nIdeally you want to make large numbers of users love you, but you can't expect to hit that right away.\n\n\nInitially you have to choose between satisfying all the needs of a subset of potential users, or satisfying a subset of the needs of all potential users. \n\nTake the first. It's easier to expand userwise than satisfactionwise.\n\n\nAnd perhaps more importantly, it's harder to lie to yourself.\n\nIf you think you're 85% of the way to a great product, how do you know it's not 70%? Or 10%?\n\nWhereas it's easy to know how many users you have.\n\n\n## 6. Offer surprisingly good customer service.\n\nCustomers are used to being maltreated.\n\nTry making your customer service not merely good, but surprisingly good. \n\nGo out of your way to make people happy.\n\n\nThey'll be overwhelmed; you'll see.\n\nIn the earliest stages of a startup, it pays to offer customer service on a level that wouldn't scale, because it's a way of learning about your users.\n\n\n## 7. You make what you measure.\n\nMerely measuring something has an uncanny tendency to improve it.\n\nIf you want to make your user numbers go up, put a big piece of paper on your wall and every day plot the number of users.\n\n\nYou'll be delighted when it goes up and disappointed when it goes down.\n\nPretty soon you'll start noticing what makes the number go up, and you'll start to do more of that.\n\nCorollary: be careful what you measure.\n\n\n## 8. Spend little.\n\nI can't emphasize enough how important it is for a startup to be cheap. \n\nMost startups fail before they make something people want, and the most common form of failure is running out of money.\n\nSo being cheap is (almost) interchangeable with iterating rapidly.\n\n\n## 9. Get ramen profitable.\n\n\"Ramen profitable\" means a startup makes just enough to pay the founders' living expenses.\n\n\n## 10. Avoid distractions.\n\nNothing kills startups like distractions.\n\nThe worst type are those that pay money: day jobs, consulting, profitable side-projects.\n\nThe startup may have more long-term potential, but you'll always interrupt working on it to answer people paying you now.\n\n\n## 11. Don't get demoralized\n\nThough the immediate cause of death in a startup tends to be running out of money, the underlying cause is usually lack of focus.\n\nEither the company is run by stupid people (which can't be fixed with advice) or the people are smart but got demoralized\n\n\n## 12. Don't give up.\n\nEven if you get demoralized, don't give up.\n\nYou can get surprisingly far by just not giving up. This isn't true in all fields.\n\n\nThere are a lot of people who couldn't become good mathematicians no matter how long they persisted.\n\nBut startups aren't like that. Sheer effort is usually enough, so long as you keep morphing your idea.\n\n\n## 13. Deals fall through.\n\nOne of the most useful skills we learned from Viaweb was not getting our hopes up.\n\n\nWe probably had 20 deals of various types fall through.\n\nAfter the first 10 or so we learned to treat deals as background processes that we should ignore till they get terminated.\n\n\nHaving gotten it down to 13 sentences, I asked myself which I'd choose if I could only keep one.\n\nUnderstand your users. That's the key.\n\nThe essential task in a startup is to create wealth; the dimension of wealth you have most control over is how much you improve users' lives.\n\n\nThe hardest part of that is knowing what to make for them.\n\nOnce you know what to make, it's mere effort to make it, and most decent hackers are capable of that.\n\n\nUnderstanding your users is part of half the principles in this list.\n\nThat's the reason to launch early, to understand your users.\n\nEvolving your idea is the embodiment of understanding your users. \n\n\nUnderstanding your users well will tend to push you toward making something that makes a few people deeply happy.\n\nThe most important reason for having surprisingly good customer service is that it helps you understand your users.\n\n\nAnd understanding your users will even ensure your morale, because when everything else is collapsing around you, having just ten users who love you will keep you going.\n\nRead the full essay \u2192 http://www.paulgraham.com/13sentences.html\n\nWhat would be your 1 startup advice?",

            "comment": "\" Avoid a day job\"... sure when you have money to survive. But c'mon who are we kidding. Unless your startup is paying you money right now, it is literally a glorified side hustle/passion project. Giving in to this idea that one should go all in has caused so much pain to so many founders. A slow simmer is better than burning out after a quick flame. It's fine, if your startup takes time and if your job is demanding. Let's not glorify shooting ourselves in the foot for a very uncertain future, which is our start-up.\n\nOn the flip side, I do agree that not having any distractions is amazing. It can do wonders to your startup. But unfortunately that isn't a reality for many of us. \n\nAlso build fast doesn't mean build hastily. Take your time if you think your product needs a certain level of quality before it reaches your customers. Customers know a shoddy product when they see one. Don't let that be your customer's first impression of your product. Build a core product, that functions well atleast 90 percent of the time. The last ten percent is what we ought to strive for in each update. But don't settle for building a product that breaks easily but solves the problem at hand.",

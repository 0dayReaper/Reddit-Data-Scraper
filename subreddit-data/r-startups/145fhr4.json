It\u2019s from a well known fund and they sent over the standard YC safe. \n\nOur lawyer is someone we matched with through our formation software is very upset about the dilution language in the standard document for successive SAFE rounds. \n\nJust wondering if anyone\u2019s encountered this and how they\u2019ve walked that tightrope?",

You may want to use an LLC, especially at the beginning. A good lawyer can gear the docs accordingly. Also pay attention to pre versus post money valuations. Best of luck.",

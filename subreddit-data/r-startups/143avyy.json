    "postText": "Hi. We are launching a startup related to IT and 3D printing. We have formed an idea, a work plan, we are setting up moments with production.  Now we are at the stage of investment. According to our calculations we can start with investment of $ 100k (but ideally get around $ 500k).   \nWe started looking for investors in Linkedin, but by posting a post, it did not work. Installed new connections, but the conversion rate in the responses got about 1%, but so far, too, no result.   \nAlso, following the advice, we considered a crowdfunding platform, but in some applications lasts for months, some are already asking for a virtually finished product, which we do not have.   \nWe've been at this for about a month and we're not giving up yet.   \nWho has already gone through this path, can you share your cases?  \nOr do you know companies/agencies which can help to attract investment for commission?",

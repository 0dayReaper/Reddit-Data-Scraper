But I\u2019ve noticed how many apps don\u2019t charge anything in the beginning. For my paid users they make their money back within days. Definitely within the month. So I\u2019m not sure if to charge right out the gate as we are pre launch. Or just be free for a while. Thoughts? \n\n\n (We have a 2 week free trial we are thinking of first)",

The post Facebook era has shown the value of user base and that it why a lot of apps are free. These days the trend is towards micro transactions and reoccurring subscriptions. The main reason is scalability and making the product available for the masses. If you look at Adobe for example. \n\nInitially Adobe was sold as a one time software purchase of around 600 US dollars. Expensive but worth it to some individuals. Now they run on a subscription model at 9.99 USD. The lower cost means lower revenue per transaction but a much higher volume. Their revenue has hit record highs and market cap has doubled since their switch to the subscription model. This can be seen with other apps and such.\n\nOn the other hand companies who are more concerned with their brand value or reputation tend to go the other direction.",

If you look at the time around adobes switch from the perpetual model to the subscription model around 2011-2012 you will see their revenue sitting around 1.2 billion and then their shift in revenue to 4.7 billion for 2022 (no real major m&amp;a until 2022). Technically their market cap has 9x in the time span since 2012 but they weren\u2019t really pushing subscriptions hard. Now I\u2019m that same time period inflation has deflated the dollar meaning that some of the growth we are seeing is synthetic, which you are correct about but not at that rate. The dollar in 2012 is worth around 1.32 these days which is a significant shift. But assuming all else equal adobes market cap would not have gone from 18 billion to 170 billion due to inflationary pressures. Their revenue change cannot be explained just through the change in money supply. This shows a fundamental change in corporate structure and in my opinion the change towards subscription based SaaS sales. But in the end this is just my theory and it doesn\u2019t really matter.",

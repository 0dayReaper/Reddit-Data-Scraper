Focus on achieving Product Validation, revenue, and traction with the resources you have.\n\nYou do not need big VCs at the early stage of your startup lifecycle. Every metropolitan area has many people that qualify as accredited investors. Many have active angels and syndicates. Leverage your community.\n\nWhile working on being investable, lean on your government and community foundations (non-profits) that support entrepreneurship and economic development. There are many underutilized resources and programs at the local and regional levels because most founders think they have to be in Silicon Valley--that there are no resources around them. They don't even bother looking or asking.\n\n[SBA.gov](https://SBA.gov)   \n[SCORE.org](https://SCORE.org)  \n[americassbdc.org](https://americassbdc.org)\n\nContact your City Manager or dedicated Economic Development Manager.",

Every state nowadays has a tech/startup hub, Ohio's is probably smaller than a lot but not like you couldn't start one there. Especially post covid. As others have said, access to VC would be the biggest hurdle. Worth noting that not every startup needs a multi billion dollar VC backing, sometimes a local investment group, local banks, or smaller independent investors/VCs do just as well or maybe even better (depending on what your business is ofc, if you're a rocket startup you probably need those billionaires)",

The concentration of venture capital and angel investors in the West Coast makes it easier for startups in that region to secure financial support. Additionally, attracting top talent can be more challenging for startups located outside the established tech hubs. However, there are unique benefits to being outside the West Coast. Lower cost of living, a supportive local community, and access to untapped markets can provide advantages. With the rise of remote work and technological advancements, startups from anywhere can connect globally, allowing them to thrive and succeed regardless of their location.",

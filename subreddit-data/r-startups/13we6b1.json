I don't know anyone in the market, have 0 contacts and what I really really need is guidance, please can anyone help me with the same?\n\nI tried sending mails to VC Firms but 90% didn't respond.",

            "comment": "I think I have figured this out although I'm not perfect by far. I have raised nearly $1M just through angel investment. It's not efficient at all, but it gets the job done. Here are my tips:\n\n1) Be personable. VCs have checklists and operate based on numbers, but angels work on feeling. If they don't like you, you won't get investment.\n\n2) Set sharp deadlines. Angels work unilaterally and so they can write a cheque in minutes if they want to. They need to know that if they don't invest someone else will and the opportunity will be lost.\n\n3) Find experts in your field. If you're truly doing something special, they will see it. \n\n4) Have a good pitch and do your homework. This is clear obviously, but you need to come off as confident and as a steward of their investment. \n\n5) Leverage existing angels for their network to multiple investment. Angels often bring their buddies in, so leverage it!\n\n\nThere is more, but that sums up most of it.",

They also implement new content filters day after day, and now, these shadow banning and #biasedbanning practices are unfortunately platform defaults.

We are also implementing ethical income models such as an independent small business friendly ad network, sponsorships, donation supported community (like Wikipedia), and other B2B services.  \nIf we succeed, every year JustOne will donate its profits to women and LGBTQIA+ owned small businesses and organizations all over the world.  \n**What life cycle stage is your startup at?**  \nWe have built an MVP and are talking to early adopters and getting feedback from users.  \n**Your role?**  \nI'm a volunteer (member of the board of directors).  \n**What goals are you trying to reach this month?**  \nMore users, more feedback...

I'm a trader and if anything, I think most traders prefer to post about their gains (from their RH screenshots for example) rather than the price of the actual stock. Maybe think of incorporating a 'gains' screenshot into the frame, or at least try to get that information onto the print as well? Even then, I don't think traders or finance persons are necessarily looking for a product like this (unless your market research says otherwise). \n\nI think your prints are clean, and the website is nice at the least.

We try to simplify developer's lives, by offering free assets, music tracks and other tools to speed up development and reduce cost.   \nIndie Games Pass is an opportunity to broaden the horizon of gamers and let them discover new games and genres that they would never play, but guess what? They tried them and developed a taste for them. Meaning there's a great opportunity for developers who are making something a little more niche.\n\n\r\n\nStage: MVP testing and finding games to add to the our content\r  \n\r  \nLooking for:\r Feedback on the pitch, product, and website.",

            "comment": "Verified Dating\n\nLocation: Sacramento, CA\n\n\nElevator Pitch: \nI have created a non-profit startup to give training and a comprehensive psych evaluation for their understanding of consent, boundaries, coping skills, and engendered cultural norms all specifically focused on dating and hookup culture. In addition to passing the exam, they also have to pass a background check for sex related crimes and agree to a code of conduct. Certified people can then post a screenshot of their certification for their OLD profiles (you can see a prototype we built [here](https://verify-dating.vercel.app/searchResult)) where women can look up the certification number and see their current status, name, and photo. Once someone passes the first cert, they have access to additional certifications for specific subject matters such as BDSM, ethical poly, working with a partner with sexual trauma, and others. I am still at the state where I could use input on the topics covered on the main exam and possible ideas or thought leaders for the additional certifications. \n\nThe initial sign up fee and exam costs $50 per person and $10 for each additional addon certification. Profits would benefit domestic violence shelters and support men's mental health non-profits. \n\nLifecycle: I have created an MVP for the lookup system to search the current status of certification. I am working on the comprehensive evaluation for applicants. I have a few working professionals helping make this happen with volunteer hours such as a lawyer, developer, and psychologist. \n\nRole: I am merely the connecting piece. This is a passion project of mine and I would like to see it happen, including working on strategy and collecting people together to get it going. \n\nGoals: \nI hope to have a code of conduct and first draft of the psych eval exam by the end of the month. \n\nHelp: \nWho has setup background checks before? What is the process like? Costs? Does anyone have any tips or tricks about implementation for an exam system through traditional vendors or custom implementations? I could also seek interest from people who might be interested in helping on this passion project such as developers or socially conscious socialites, if Reddit has those. \n\nAlso notable... Moral support is always welcome. \n\nThanks!!",

I\u2019ve also had plenty of positive feedback about my leadership skills from the teams I\u2019ve led, the people I\u2019ve worked for, and my peers. My cofounder has similar experience. \n\nMore importantly, we\u2019ve received positive feedback about the impact of the advice we\u2019re giving from our existing subscribers, although growing our audience and getting wider feedback is still an important goal for us. \n\nMost important of all, the thing we\u2019re most keen to promote is deliberate practice. We stand behind our advice, but wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s unique: you can read similar messages in many book and blogs on leadership.

            "comment": "We already shared our Idea here previously. However, after talking to potential customers and incubators, we pivoted quite a bit. So i feel it's time to take changes into account and post here again...\n\n**Startup Name / URL:** ehando.de\n\n**Location of Your Headquarters:** Karlsruhe, Germany\n\n**Slogan:** Online shoppen. Lokal kaufen.(We are a german based company, so it's German. Basically translates to: Shop around Online. Buy Local.)\n\n**Elevator Pitch:** Einkaufen wie im Internet, nur besser: Egal was du suchst, wir zeigen dir, wo du es in deiner N\u00e4he findest. Ohne Stress, ohne Lieferzeiten, ohne \u00dcberraschungen. (In english: Convenient shopping, done better: whatever you are looking for, we show you where you find it locally. Stress free, no waiting for delivery, no bad surprises.)\n\n**More details:** Why are people buying online? Not because buying online is better by itself, but because it's much more convenient than taking time out of your busy day to find stores in your area, physically visit those stores and look for the product of your choice there. The act of online shopping is so much more convenient that people even accept the downsides of it, such as days up to weeks of delivery time, incorrect product descriptions, lost packages, porch pirates and others.\n\nDuring market research, we identified a gap between online shopping and local shopping, so we decided to fill it: We merged the functionality of a search engine with an online shop, fill it with product stock and article information for local businesses, and combine the upsides of ordering online with  the upsides of buying local, while eliminating most of both their downsides. So rather than \"Conveniently finding and ordering something on Amazon and dealing with the downsides during delivery\", People use our portal to conveniently look up whatever they need, find the product and potential alternatives, identify stores in their vicinity that carry those products, and then physically purchase it at their closest and/or cheapest store.\n\nYour success so far: We generated quite a bit of interest and are currently getting coverage in local news outlets and southern german major newspapers. We have the former head of internal development for a major European IT company acting as our Development Consultant, and we have a southern German serial entrepreneur and business angel mentoring us.\n\n**Your role?** Founder, \"CEO\"\n\n**What goals are you trying to reach this month?** Completing our MVP and eliminating all the minor bugs and quirks that we currently run into since we went live. Not just this month, but for the next months: Successfully proof our concept. Later this year / Hopefully in the future: Switch from our MVP platform to a more / easier scalable technology.\n\n**How could** r/startups **help?** If there are germans around here: Try it out (we are currently available in the Karlsruhe and S\u00fcdpfalz regions) and provide feedback.\n\n**Discount for** r/startup **subscribers?** Not really applicable yet, but if there are german merchants around who are willing to beta-test the merchant side of things, we are willing to talk about goodies down the road.",

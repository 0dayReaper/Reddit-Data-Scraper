We are projecting to get 2% market share within 3 years.   \n\n\nI'm a noob with these things so please feel free to correct or enlighten me. Or if you have other ways to calculate how much equity to give F&amp;F investors, would greatly appreciate it! Thanks!",

You can realistically grow at 20-200% for a few years.  That\u2019s not going to get you to 2% in 3 years.  You are looking at this in the wrong order.  At some point way out in the future, you might get to 2%, but that\u2019s not today.  Today you are 0% with no customers.",

Spend a few thousand, see the users that you get out of it, and you can then guess the number of users that you can get further out.  A word of warning on estimates, if you spend $1k on google and facebook ads, you won't get double with $2k or 10x with $10k.  You do tend to get more, but the return isn't linear at some point.\n\nI recommend that as you work on your mvp, ask your mvp users to comment on their social media spaces to help you.  You will end up with a set of ultra trustworthy mvp users.  These are the ones that might help you.  Don't get mad if they don't.  Just hope that some will.  Start with these.  After a short term, add some ads and start watching the return.\n\nAll of this is  best guess.  You just need to have some method to the madness.",

If something better comes along, they are more willing to change.\n\nHow will those customers orient themselves in the marketplace. Something will make them seek for alternatives.\n\nToday we have search engines with the expressed aim of delivering up to date, relevant information. It will thus be reasonable that OP's company, if superior to the establishment, quickly becomes prominent there.\n\nThe cost of advertising may therefore not be as massive. They may go viral. The question though, will search engines give \"free\" visibility to upcoming brands if that potentially lowers the profitability of their ad business? It makes little sense to move the competition for visibility away from having the biggest marketing budget.",

It's also a terrible way to think about traction and investors like Y Combinator actually say that they use it as a warning sign to steer clear of founders.\n\nTam should be bottom up. I've reached out to X people and get them on my app waiting list at a rate of Y% there are Z people that are in the exact same niche as the people who have responded and there are A other niches with a total market size of B, so our TAM, SAM, SOM is....\n\nThe important thing is to base it off some acquisition metric that you are able to achieve. Even if it's just we're getting potential user feedback at a rate of, if we can turn 10% of those into customers, etc...\n\nObviously the more real the acquisition metric, the better the market forecasting will be.\n\nBut you don't really need any of that crap to value a super early stage business.\n\n2 useful stats might be:\n1. Y combinator automatically values startups at a million but they heavily select towards people likely to turn that into a billion and take 6% in return IIRC \n2. A lot of investment rounds take somewhere in the range of 20 - 25%, you really don't want to go over this number before your A round if you can help it, otherwise you'll get too diluted later on",

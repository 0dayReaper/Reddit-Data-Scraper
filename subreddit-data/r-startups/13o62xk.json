Medical field, highly regulated by FDA. \n\nBusiness Plan complete\nInfrastructure complete\nPitch Deck complete\nRegulatory and Compliance has passed and received official approval. \n\nWebsite / E-commerce Not complete \nPersonnel are contracted and ready to go.\n(Ex-fortune 300 leaders and industry experts on the board and team)\n\nZero profit until year 4 commences. \n\n$480,000 cash burn for three years. Founders would be equity partners for up to 25% with minimal income (think minimum wage)/ stipend for the first three years. \n\nFree cash ends up at 1.5 million in 10 years, with half a million profit per year at year 9. \n\nThey feel my growth numbers are too conservative and that I should be increasing my projections and growth. I\u2019m sticking to under promising and over delivering to have manageable growth. \n\nFour VC meetings set up, 2 private meetings with potential investors as well. Need help with identifying how much to ask for round 1 funding at what equity? Initial recommendations came in at 25% at half a million, which I feel is shooting myself in the foot at giving away so much equity at round 1 funding for such a small amount.",

            "comment": "You need to show numbers that are achievable - not pessimistic, not optimistic or conservative. It\u2019s subtle but very important you understand this difference. 10 year horizon is too far out - especially with those potential returns. 3-5 year projected financials are more useful. You need to show an exit of 10-15x to the seed round investors with potential exit at year 5. 18 month funding runway is common - this drives quantum you\u2019d ask to raise. Find out the typical company valuation multiple at exits in your field. I mean this kindly, but would really urge you to find a mentor - you\u2019re going to have a hard time raising (and running a commercial enterprise) if you try and figure this stuff out as you go.",

If you're best-case is doing 500K at year 9 there's no way investors can possibly get to their 100x target return.  Perhaps you've built a business with a 10x on revenue multiple, that's a 5M valuation after 9 years with about 4.5M invested.\n\nBefore you talk to investors make sure you have a financial model built out that makes sense from the investor perspective.\n\nSource - I'm an investor helping early stage founders, currently focused on AI and ML.",

C will be 4 to 7 million. \nBased on your statement. I dont have strong feelings this will be scalable. Lot of investors will have lots of concerns. 25 percent is security for them. Your company seems risky.",

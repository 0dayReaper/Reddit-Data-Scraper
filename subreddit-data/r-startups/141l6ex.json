    "postText": "Hello everyone. I am a wholesaler of software licenses and refurbished hardware and mobile phones. Most of my customers are eBay sellers or online shop owners. I am currently diving into social media marketing (which I have never done before) and I've noticed that many niches, especially those for software licenses, are challenging to market. Until now, everything has relied on recommendations or direct contact. Does anyone have any advice in this regard?",

Now it feels like I'm starting from 0 when I should be broadcasting it to the world, so I'll have to resort to paid ads",

Social media marketing is all about building relationships. Respond to comments, messages, and inquiries promptly. \n\nDevelop high-quality content that showcases your software licenses and refurbished hardware and mobile phones. This could include product images, videos, tutorials, customer testimonials, and industry news. Focus on highlighting the benefits and unique selling points of your products. If possible, consider running targeted ads on LinkedIn and Twitter.",

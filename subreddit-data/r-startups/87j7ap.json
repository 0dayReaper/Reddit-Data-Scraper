    "postText": "Hi Guys,\n\nI've been designing pitch presentations all my (professional) life and have cringed so many times watching shark tank.\n\nMost pitches there flat out stink with people falling into two categories:\n\n- Not enough information\n\n- Way too much information\n\nThat's a shame because making a pitch is not that hard. You just need to know the **formula**. And that formula is well known, because:\n\n**It is the format recommended by the legendary venture capital firm Sequoia Capital.**\n\nSo today, I'm going to use that format and re-design a famous Airbnb pitch.\n\nI'm goinggoing to improve the original pitch (at least I like to think so...) in every way, based on the [Sequioa guidelines](https://www.slideshare.net/PitchDeckCoach/sequoia-capital-pitchdecktemplate).\n\nAnd in other good news, the deck is **only 10 slides long** (+ one extra slide)...\n\nSo, let\u2019s dive in!\n\nNote: If you want to read the article with (much) better formatting you can also find it here: [Anatomy of a Perfect Startup Pitch Deck \u2013 11 Critical Pages](https://bluetieslides.com/anatomy-perfect-startup-pitch-deck-11-critical-pages/)\n\nEDIT 1: \n\nI have received a couple of PMs asking me to help with their pitch deck. I don't want to do that. Go here instead http://firstround.com/philosophy/#pitch-assist\n\nI don't know them or endorse them but they seem like the real deal.\n\nBefore we begin: Each section is formatted the same way.\n\n1. Start with the Airbnb slide (if they have one)\n2. Give my comments and detail, what should be in it (based on Sequoia guidelines)\n3. Redesign the slide\n4. Sum up, what should be in the slide\n\n---\n\n#Slide #1: What is the purpose and mission of the company?\n\nOn the first page of your slide deck, you should simply write the mission of your company in a single sentence.\n\nTo us, this concept can be quite high-flying so let\u2019s look at some company purpose examples from their early investor presentations:\n\nFacebook: \u201cMaking the world more open and connected\u201d, (which was changed to \u201cGive people the power to build community and bring the world closer together\u201d in 2017)\n\nAirbnb: \u201cThe mission is to live in this world where one day you can feel like you're home anywhere and not in a home, but truly home, where you belong\u201d\n\nYouTube: \u201cTo become the primary outlet of user-generated video content on the Internet, and to allow anyone to upload, share, and browse this content.\"\n\nAs such, the first slide is quite simple, we have just a headline and a purpose statement. However, it is very important and showing your passion for the product or service you. After all, if you can\u2019t be passionate about it how are you going to convince others it\u2019s so great?\n\nhttps://bluetieslides.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/03/Startup-pitch-deck-slide-2.jpg\n\n---\n\n#Slide #2: The problem you are trying to solve or the \u201cnod your head\u201d phase\n\nNext up, you are going to describe the problem your product is trying to solve. We have also coined this \u201cThe Head-Nod Phase\u201d because if your potential investors aren\u2019t nodding their heads at this point\u2026 well, chances are they\u2019ll not invest in you.\n\nOn the slide, you should describe the problem in a simple way investors can easily understand and here are some key pointers to have in mind:\n\nIs at a must-solve problem or a nice-to solve problem? In short, how painful is this for customers?\n\n- How do customers and users solve the problem today? Some older technology or manually?\n\n- What are the issues with the current solutions that enables you to capture this market?\n\n- Is it an obvious problem? If, not then what is your proof that the problem exists?\n\nNow, that doesn\u2019t sound so hard so let\u2019s look at what Airbnb did:\n\nhttps://bluetieslides.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/03/Airbnb-pitch-slide-2.jpg\n\n- Price is an important concern for customers booking travel online\n\n- Hotels leave you disconnected from the city and its culture\n\n- No easy way exists to book a room with a local or become a host\n\nNow, you\u2019ll likely be nodding your head: Before Airbnb, this was an extremely common problem that most if not all people had experienced when traveling.\n\nAlso, notice that this opens several reasons why you should use Airbnb:\n\n- The first reason is fully based on price, i.e. use Airbnb and save money: Speaks to the budget-oriented buyer\n\n- Disconnect from the culture of the city. This speaks more to the culturally oriented and nomad type of customer, that usually stay longer at a place and engages with the locals\n\nHaving the latter angle ensured Airbnb got a lot of love from digital nomads and it became cool to use it \u2013 if they only had the budget angle, this probably wouldn\u2019t have happened.\n\n**Now, this is one thing Airbnb postponed until later in their slide deck.**\n\nIn line with Sequoia, we recommend also outlining how the customer addresses the issue today. Airbnb waited until later in their presentation. They didn\u2019t do that directly, instead, they implicitly stated that people were using CouchSurfing.com and Craigslist to offer temporary housing.\n\nHere\u2019s what we would have done.\n\nToday people are forced into one of two solutions for user-to-user housing:\n\n- Craigslist: Serves as local classifieds for temporary housing \u00e0 lacks validation for both buyer and seller\n\n- Couchsurfing.com: Community based on sharing principles with no economic incentive to rent out.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the final slide we would have put together for Airbnb:\n\nhttps://bluetieslides.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/03/Startup-pitch-deck-slide-3.jpg\n\nNote that this slide addresses all our bullets from the beginning:\n\n- Level of pain: It is a very painful problem for both users and customers\n\n- How\u2019s the problem solved today? The problem is solved today with older technology\n\n- What are the issues with current technology? Highlights several issues with the current technology\n\n- Is it an obvious problem? Yes, as people are already solving it through other avenues\n\nTo sum up, slide #2 should address the following:\n\n- Describe the pain of the customer (or the customer\u2019s customer)\n\n- Outline how the customer addresses the issue today\n\n---\n\n#Slide #3: The solution you offer (or the let\u2019s get excited slide!)\n\nBy this time, you should already have the attention of your audience \u2013 now it\u2019s time to get them excited.\n\nTo do that, you need to blow them away with the solution you offer to the particular problem from slide #2.\n\nHere\u2019s how Airbnb did it:\n\nhttps://bluetieslides.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/03/Airbnb-pitch-slide-3.jpg\n\nWhat do you think of the slide? Before you make up your mind here is our take:\n\n- It\u2019s a bit underwhelming\n\n- We get the idea, but we\u2019re not particularly excited by it\n\nSo, what would make it better?\n\nWell, for starters let\u2019s look at the Sequoia guidelines again. For the solution slide they are:\n\n- Demonstrate your company\u2019s value proposition to make the customer\u2019s life better\n\n- Show where your product physically sits\n\n- Provide use cases\n\nAs you can see, Airbnb only did the first and that\u2019s why it becomes underwhelming.\n\nNow, in our example, we would naturally include the two others on the slide as well and here\u2019s the solution slide we would have made for Airbnb.\n\nhttps://bluetieslides.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/03/Startup-pitch-deck-slide-4.jpg\n\nAt least we\u2019re excited by the idea now and it just shows how vital the information on where the company sits and especially the use cases are important. In our mind, a solution is good, but providing case examples is even better.\n\nSumming up slide 3, here\u2019s what it should contain:\n\n- Demonstrate your company\u2019s value proposition to make the customer\u2019s life better\n\n- Show where your product physically sits\n\n- Provide use cases\n\n---\n\n#Slide #4: The then and now slide, aka the why now slide\n\nOn slide #4, there\u2019s probably a bit more digging to do, and this is where storytelling comes in. Basically, the investor wants to know two things:\n\n- How has this market developed over time?\n\n- If it\u2019s such a great idea, why has no one ever done this? I also refer to this as \u201crecent trends that have made this solution possible\u201d.\n\n###How has the market developed over time?\n\nIn saying how this market has developed over time there are two options:\n\n1. A boring list of things that have happened over time\n\n2. A chance to already address market sizing, competitors, and validation of the idea\n\nNaturally, I prefer going with option 2, where you can also bring some humor and edge into the presentation. This increases the chances of the investor\u2019s remembering you.\n\nNow, Airbnb didn\u2019t have this slide in their presentation, but if they did, the historical evolution of the market could have been something like this:\n\n- Staying with locals has been popular since the Birth of Christ. Mary and Joseph found no place at the Inn and stayed with a local\n\n- In the last 50 years, bed and breakfasts have been popular with travelers. Here you are basically invited into the homes of people and get to share in their lives\n\n- In the 2000\u2019s, Couchsurfing has become popular which is based on people letting spare room for travelers\n\n###Recent trends that have made this possible\n\nMoving on from that, we now need to define the recent trends that have made this possible.\n\nAgain, this serves as a double chance to also demonstrate pain points that demonstrate, why the timing is so great.\n\nI would set this up with a few \u201cthen and now columns\u201d. This highlights the pain points that have previously been associated with the industry and shows why now is such a great time for Airbnb to become a major hit.\n\nhttps://bluetieslides.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/03/Startup-pitch-deck-slide-5.jpg\n\nA few comments on the then and now boxes:\n\n- There has been a security issue for hosts (and travelers). You have been letting people into your homes who might have bad intentions. This is solved with social vetting.\n\n- Travelers have had no way to judge whether the host was good or not. Hotels.com has solved this for hotels while Airbnb solves this for user-to-user travel.\n\n- The gig economy is making it socially acceptable to let out your rooms and make an extra dime on the side\n\nSumming up slide #4, here\u2019s what you need in it:\n\n- Set-up the historical evolution of your category\n\n- Define recent trends that make your solution possible\n\n---\n\n#Slide #5: The prospective buyer and the size of the market\n\nWe are now getting to the slide in the deck you have the least control over: The size of the market.\n\nAnd unfortunately, the size of the market is also a huge determinant in \u201chow rich you can get\u201d. Naturally, the larger the market you can serve, the higher a return the investor can get and the more they\u2019ll pay for your company.\n\nLet\u2019s again start by seeing how Airbnb did this:\n\nhttps://bluetieslides.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/03/Airbnb-pitch-slide-5.jpg\n\nAgain, a slide where the message gets across, however, several things are lacking.\n\nBut first off, let\u2019s start with something Airbnb totally skipped: The typical customer. Here\u2019s our take on the initial (early adopter) of Airbnb:\n\n- Aged 20-40\n\n- Culturally curious and aware of the budget\n\nThis should be relatively simple for most companies and believe us: If you don\u2019t know your typical customer you won\u2019t raise any money.\n\n###Market sizing: What is TAM, SAM, and SOM?\n\nNext up we get to the size of the market. This section should include three things:\n\n- Total Addressable Market (\u201cTAM\u201d). This is all the people who can use your product\n\n- Serviceable Available Market (\u201cSAM\u201d). A part of TAM who are likely to use your product\n\n- Serviceable Obtainable Market (\u201cSOM\u201d). The subset of your SAM, that you can reasonably expect to get as customers over the next 3 years\n\nNow, a lot of start-ups struggle with this so let\u2019s take a step back to explain these. First off, here\u2019s a graphical interpretation of the three:\n\nhttps://bluetieslides.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/03/TAM-SAM-and-SOM-300x300.jpg\n\nStill confused? No worry, and let\u2019s again take Airbnb as an example:\n\n###Total addressable market\n\nThe TAM of Airbnb would be the worldwide hotel and bnb market. \n\nBasically, if you could only book any kind of stay through Airbnb the revenue of the company would be equal to TAM\u2026\n\n\u2026 which is not going to happen.\n\n###Serviceable addressable market\n\nLet\u2019s be more realistic instead. As Airbnb was named Air Bed and Breakfast when it started, it would be more natural to say the SAM would be equal to the entire Bed and Breakfast market.\n\nNow some of you might say this is too small a market because some hotel users will (and have) shifted to Airbnb \u2013 and you are right.\n\nBut meeting investors, it is a good idea to err on the side of caution if (for no other reason) than the fact that they have seen so many pitches where the market sizing is completely off (if you watch Shark Tank you\u2019ve probably seen this and seen, how angry the sharks get at unrealistic expectations).\n\nFor TAM and SAM, you\u2019ll probably have to find market reports or similar, to get a feel for the size of the market.\n\n####The bottom-up market sizing approach:\n\nA lot of people struggle with the bottom-up approach of the SAM so here\u2019s how we do it: The approach uses simple math to estimate the size of the market, combined with some market statistics. Investors love to see this as they can easily track your assumptions.\n\nBe aware, that these assumptions can also be a trap, as investors will judge you hard if you are too optimistic about your assumptions.\n\nHere\u2019s how to do it:\n\n1. Start with the TAM\n2. Estimate the number of transactions in the market per year\n3. Estimate the average transaction value (this can be either a market figure or a figure based on your own numbers)\n\n###Serviceable Obtainable Market\n\nThe SOM is more forgiving. This is usually represented as a percentage of the SAM. This could, for example, be capturing 20% of the bed and breakfast market.\n\nNow you might think you\u2019re done, but investors love to see a growing market. For that, it\u2019s a good idea to include the annual growth rate of the market (\u201cCAGR\u201d) \u2013 this will typically be included in the market reports where you have found your data.\n\nPutting it all together, here\u2019s how our final market slide would look for Airbnb.\n\nhttps://bluetieslides.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/03/Startup-pitch-deck-slide-6.jpg\n\nTo sum up, the market slide should contain:\n\n- Identify/profile the customer you cater to\n\n- Calculate the TAM (top-down), SAM (bottom-up) and SOM\n\n---\n\n#Slide #6: Detailing competition and showing why you're superior\n\nThis is one slide where Airbnb did a good job, so let\u2019s start with their example:\n\nhttps://bluetieslides.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/03/Airbnb-pitch-slide-9.jpg\n\nThere are many ways to visualize the market, but the one Airbnb used is by far our favorite: The \u201cGartner Magic Quadrant\u201d.\n\nIn this 2x2 matrix, you define the two most important points of differentiation in your industry and plot your competitors on this \u2013 and Airbnb did that well.\n\nAirbnb highlights all transactions are online and that they are more affordable than their competitors which is easy to understand.\n\nThey also didn\u2019t fall into one of the traps that many startups fall into: Not identifying any competitors.\n\nThey had already used Couchsurfing and Craigslist previously in the deck to show social proof, so naturally, these two are on the slide. They also addressed both Hostels.com and Hotels.com as clear competitors.\n\nThis is genius as it shows that their market could be much larger than just Couchsurfing and Craigslist and instead compete with the wider Hostel and Hotel markets as well.\n\nNow, one thing that Airbnb didn\u2019t have on their slide is listing their competitive advantages. This can be shown in a number of ways, but we like to set up a simple matrix highlighting the advantages over our product compared to each of our competitors.\n\nPutting it all together, here\u2019s how we would have made the Airbnb competition slide.\n\nhttps://bluetieslides.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/03/Startup-pitch-deck-slide-7.jpg\n\nSumming up, here the two things your competition slide should contain:\n\n- The 2x2 Gartner Magic Quadrant with your competitors\n\n- Highlight your competitive advantages\n\n---\n\n#Slide #7: Showcasing your superior product to get investors talking\n\nHere\u2019s how Airbnb described their product:\n\nhttps://bluetieslides.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/03/Airbnb-pitch-slide-6.jpg\n\nWe think their product presentation is bad, and we would seriously enhance this page. Here\u2019s why we think it fails:\n\n- All three pictures are quite small and don\u2019t seem very sexy\n\n- They fail to highlight their uniqueness \u2013 to us, this could just as well have been a Hotels.com pitch.\n\nNow, it\u2019s easy to criticize, so here\u2019s how we would fix these things:\n\n- Use smartphone pictures instead of web pictures \u2013 these work much better in a presentation as they are optimized for smaller screens\n\n- Add bullets to highlight what makes each step of the process unique\n\n- Highlight building critical mass and network effect across the product\n\nEspecially the latter is very important, as it highlights the switching costs. Airbnb (to our knowledge) is not protected by intellectual property rights \u2013 instead, they are protected by their market power: People post homes on Airbnb because that\u2019s where the customers are. If they switch to another provider chances are, they\u2019ll lose money as there are fewer customers.\n\nHere\u2019s our product slide for Airbnb:\n\nhttps://bluetieslides.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/03/Startup-pitch-deck-slide-8.jpg\n\nSumming up, here\u2019s what the product page should contain:\n\n- Product line-up including any relevant features such as (a) form factor, (b) functionality, (c) features, (d) architecture, (e) intellectual property), etc.\n\n- Development roadmap for your product (not relevant for Airbnb)\n\n---\n\n#Slide #8: Let\u2019s make some money also known as your business model slide\n\nAnd now to the really fun part: Making money!\n\nHere\u2019s how Airbnb rakes in the dough:\n\nhttps://bluetieslides.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/03/Airbnb-pitch-slide-7.jpg\n\nThe Airbnb slide gets the message across and also shows significant proof of concept with revenue of USD 200m from 2008-2011. We would keep this information on the slide.\n\nHowever, the slide also has some shortcomings. While they are correct in stating that their business model is \u201ctaking a 10% commission on each transaction\u201d, they fail to show how this plays out in practice. We would break the information down in a different way, so you end up with a slide like below:\n\nhttps://bluetieslides.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/03/Startup-pitch-deck-slide-9.jpg\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a step back and highlight some things investors look for in the business model slide. Here are some things they like:\n\n- Active revenue streams, i.e. customers paying for a product or service\n\n- Recurring revenue streams such as monthly or annual subscriptions\n\n- Proof that customers are willing to buy the product\n\n- A growing customer base\n\nTo sum up, here\u2019s what your business model slide should contain and how we addressed it in our Airbnb presentation:\n\n- Revenue model \u2013 how revenue is generated\n\n- Pricing \u2013 in this case, the commission on each booking\n\n- Average account size and/or lifetime value \u2013 in this case, the average value of a booking to Airbnb\n\n- Sales &amp; distribution model \u2013 addressed on a previous slide\n\n- Customer/pipeline list \u2013 could be included, but we decided not to include it. We will address this in the financials slide\n\n---\n\n#Slide #9: The team slide and demonstrating why this team is superior\n\nThe team slide is one of the simplest slides in the deck but also one of the most important ones \u2013 and often one of the slides, that does not get the love it deserves. The slide is all about limiting execution risk and the smaller the execution risk, the larger the price an investor is willing to pay.\n\nThis makes perfect sense: If you were to invest in a coffee shop would you rather invest in some guy off the street or Jerry Baldwin (one of the founders of Starbucks)?...\n\nSo, here\u2019s what investors look for in the team:\n\n1. Have they worked in a similar startup? And here there are of course bonus point if the previous startup was a success\n2. Have they worked in a similar market? Here there are especially bonus points for having people on board who has worked at any of your identified competitors\n3. Have they worked with similar technology? Of less importance to Airbnb as their code is not hard to write or anything groundbreaking, however, if you have a patented product this is huge\n4. Is the team diverse? Ideally, investors like to see at least a tech/product person, a salesperson and a financial person in the team.\n5. Has the team worked together before? The longer you\u2019ve worked together, the less risk there is that things blow up and you leave because you hate the sight of each other.\n\nOn the team slide, you should include the executive management of the firm as well as your Board of Directors / Board of Advisors.\n\nNow, most people just list the names of people and where they\u2019ve worked before. However, they fail to address the issues of diversity and how long they\u2019ve worked together before.\n\nUnfortunately, Airbnb didn\u2019t include the team section in their slide package, but here\u2019s how we would do it for a random business:\n\nhttps://bluetieslides.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/03/Startup-pitch-deck-slide-10.jpg\n\nNotice a few things here:\n\n- We address all five points from above\n\n- We divide code executive management and the Board of Directors, so investors can quickly see who\u2019s who\n\n- We highlight/color code any overlap the persons have previously had so it\u2019s easy to spot for the investor\n\n---\n\n#Slide #10: Financials including forecasted revenue for the next three years\n\nOn to the last slide of the deck: The financials of the firm, and what you are going to do if you get funding.\n\nThere are quite a few ways to do this and there is no exact recipe \u2013 you can make very simple or very elaborate models showing the forecasted revenue and profitability of the company.\n\nHere at BlueTieSlides, we like to err on the side of caution and keep things simple, rather than getting lost in the intricate details of a model. We typically build a model based on assumptions about revenue, gross margin and cost levels going forward and work our way down to EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Tax Payments).\n\nThe other part is what we all came for:\n\n###The capital you\u2019re looking to raise and what it should be used for\n\nThis ties in with the three-year model you\u2019ve made: What are you actually going to use the money for?\n\nHere you should be very precise and list it in 3-4 bullets, and it should tie in with the forecast you\u2019ve made in your model. I like to use the following format:\n\n**We are seeking $xxx in a Series A:**\n\n- When you target the money raised\n\n- How much capital has already been committed\n\n**So we can:**\n\n- Reach $xxx in sales / monthly recurring revenue (\u201cMRR\u201d)\n\n- Expand to other markets / improve customer acquisition/file for more patents\n\n- Scale our infrastructure\n\nThis is very concise, and investors know exactly what the money\u2019s for.\n\nPutting it all together, here\u2019s how we would have made the financial slide for Airbnb (numbers are made up):\n\nhttps://bluetieslides.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/03/Startup-pitch-deck-slide-11.jpg\n\n---\n\n#Outro\n\nNow, Airbnb obviously did raise money so who am I to tell them their presentation was bad?\n\nNo one, however, I do think the presentation left a lot to the imagination of the reader and I do think Sequoias guidelines are great.\n\nAnd finally, I see so many people struggle with their presentation when all they need is an outline to follow.\n\nWhether you follow the outline I have given or not, I hope there's a lot you can take from the above :)\n",

This fails to address the fact that the vast majority of presentations do not have dedicated graphic designers like Apple.\n\nFurther and more importantly, if the pitch is good the first thing asked for is more info they can bring home to the analysts so they can understand the product and make calculations.\n\nCompared to the original Airbnb pitch the redesigned slides are obviously the latter.\n\nHowever, I see no reason to make presentations as barebone as the original Airbnb pitch. In a corporate finance context, the redesigned slides are still very light. ",

Sometimes he had pictures of the products, but that's it. In fact I still think that mostly rings true with Apple's current presentations too.\n\nThe difference depends on whether you are going to pitch it in-person, or if you're sending it standalone.\n\nIn person - You should literally have a couple of words or numbers on each slide. You don't want people reading your slides, you want them to listen to you talk.\n\nStandalone - Then you can add a little bit more context to certain information, but still it should not be text-heavy. You should be able to tell everything you would normally say in-person on one slide, within one or two sentences on-screen.",

            "comment": "I disagree with a large amount of the \"improvements\" made to each slide. Here are my explanations as to why:\n\n**Slide 1:**\n\nIf I had no idea what AirBnB actually did this would make next to no sense to me.  It's so long and totally unclear as to what the actual mission is at first glance. Something like \"To connect travelers with culture\" would be better and more to the point, but I would advise against including this slide at all.\n\n**Slide 2:**\n\nTheir slide is short and sweet. I get the main takeaways immediately. I like how you break apart of the problem into traveler and host, but this is way too wordy. The traveler section should just say Expensive, Disconnected, No Current Solution. The host section should say Extra Money, Share Culture. Getting into the details of reputation of hosts isn't important enough to waste time on in the first few slides.\n\n**Slide 3:**\n\nTheir slide is so elegant. I immediately understand why I want to use the platform. I want to save money, I want to earn money, and I want to share culture. They should graphically show the distinction between hosts and travelers instead of just having little text, but aside from that it's great. \n\nYour slide is maddening. Why is \"Pays securely to AirBnB\" a bullet point. Things like this are a waste of words and aren't an important thing you should be talking about. The only thing that needs to be conveyed with this slide is why each side of the marketplace wants to use the platform and do it as quickly as possible. You're trying to squeeze two slides into one slide here with the \"What our users say\" section. Also, why in the world is the traveler information above the traveler banner? It's confusing.\n\n**Slide 4:**\n\nIn general I feel like \"Why Now?\" slides are a bit silly. Unless this is a key part of what will make you succeed I really don't think there's a reason it should be included. Your brief history part is not compelling and doesn't actually explain why now. This slide like all others has way too many words and the only compelling part of this is the social proof system with ratings.\n\n**Slide 5:**\n\nI don't like TAM slides either. I think having a bullet point stating you are competing with the hotel industry in another slide should be enough to convey there is a large market. Investors do tend need a bit of hand holding with this though in my experience, so you are forced to put this slide in and state the obvious. Their slide is straight forward: big market, they have a decent amount of it. I would have preferred them to include their growth rate here though.\n\nYou are using a bottom up approach with your numbers which is good, but you have so many words and numbers here I have no idea what to look at and what's important. Show me graphically what things look like and de-emphasize the actual calculations (just show me that they are there) and emphasize the results way more.\n\n**Slide 6:**\n\nCongratulations, the first slide where yours is actually better. The original slide really doesn't show what makes AirBnB different at all and if anything shows me there are a lot of good alternatives. This slide should probably be completely reworked to have a checklist of what AirBnb has and what each competitor is missing.\n\n**Slide 7:**\n\nTheir slide is super easy to understand. I find a place I want and then book it.  Your titles are so much harder to understand \"Browse available hosts\" is much worse than \"Search by city\". It took me an extra few seconds to actually parse what the originally slides conveyed so eloquently. Do I care about all the things I can filter by? Do I care that hosts can adjust prices on the fly? No. I'm going to assume these are features that exist already and you shouldn't waste time stating the obvious. These are things best left for followup questions.\n\n**Slide 8:**\n\n10m trips, $20 fee each, $200m revenue. Simple and easy. I'm confused by your slide. It took me a second to realize that those were host and traveler icons. Icons are great, but you still need the words there. \n\nHowever, here is not the place to be differentiating between hosts and travelers. You added so much noise and told me nothing about how much you have / could make. You are making me do the math to calculate how much you made and completely ignored the fact that the average stay is 3 nights which means a lot more revenue. \n\n**Slide 9:**\n\nThe founders didn't have big fancy companies that they worked at prior to AirBnB or deep industry experience which is probably the reason they didn't have this slide. Two of the three had solid education backgrounds which they could have included, but it likely wouldn't have been compelling enough as to why they are the right team to do this. They were wise to not include this slide.\n\n**Slide 10:**\n\nWhat am I even looking at? It took me awhile to see that these were growth projections. You should be showing this graphically with the final numbers stressed only. Calculations are great and all, but I care about the result. Calculations should be off to the side so I can check if I'm skeptical, but shouldn't be the main focus. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest shortcomings of your slides is that they use sentences to describe things better said with a single word and they include irrelevant information that have no effect on my initial decision as an investor.",

Then you can like or dislike what I've done to it. \n\n2. I wanted to validate my writing style. And the content simply is much better formatted on my site.\n\n3.

    "postText": "The 30% he invested is gone. He's a \"startup founder\", in the same way Billy McFarland was a \"festival promoter\". We were running out of investor money and he couldn't find any more so in a last ditch effort to fundraise he put the rest into crypto without telling us. I only found out today after giving him an ultimatum because my salary hasn't been paid.  \n  \nHe was the only person with access to the accounts and in addition to the 30% that he lost in crypto another 30% is unaccounted for, I believe to his personal expenses. Over half our funding has been squandered at this point. I cannot stress how much this is not a surprise. This guy is a clown and over the past year I had to put up with the following:  \n  \n* Tried to convince me that an ICO was a *great* way for us to fundraise, despite our product having *nothing* to do with blockchain. I told him I wasn't willing to do the mental gymnastics to somehow shoehorn blockchain into our product.\n* Tried to convince me to let the company pay my rent so he could write it off as a business expense *and* I could avoid paying income tax on that portion of my salary, thus allowing the company to cut my gross pay while I still receive the same net. I believe this would be illegal. \n* Cared *nothing* about the product or customers beyond making it to IPO or attracting an acquisition offer. \n* Cancelled our membership at a coworking space and had us do all our meetings at *Starbucks*.\n* **Incessantly** pitched our product, to everybody, before we even had an MVP to show them. He **would not wait** until the MVP was ready, just charged full speed ahead with the same slide deck and disappointing presentation and kept getting the same rejections. Fundraising is not my expertise but I believe we lost many potential investors by pitching to them before we were ready. **edit:** Also kept applying us to incubators and accelerators that we did not meet the eligibility requirements for. \n* \"Hired\" an intern studying computer science. He was terrible and never delivered any usable code but we still spent months trying to bring him on board and give him work  because \"he's free labor!\".\n* Also hired a worthless developer (his friend, a bootcamp grad) who contributed nothing. Literally just attended our meetings and talked. I *knew* she did nothing because it took her months to even ask how to setup the local dev environment on her machine! For months she didn't even check out the code and get it running! She eventually left and somehow convinced a manufacturing company to hire her as a web developer.  \n  \nThis was my first startup, and has been quite the learning experience. I learned a lot of what *not* to do. The bad signs were there but I was willing to ride it out because I got 10% equity, a reasonable salary, and was able to work remotely. I had other freelance work so I wasn't fully invested. Please, ask me anything about this disaster story. Also if you've read this far and are looking for a full-stack developer in Los Angeles or remotely, PM me.",

If they can't pay it back, then it **does** become a problem.\n\n**Edit**: On the other hand, if you're taking the company credit card, doing a cash advance at a casino, and *then* gambling... well, that's not so good.",

Well, it's the first in the world for a reason. \n* He hired a bunch of ppl he knows without making sure they can do the job well.\n* The company doesn't have any significant tractions but he managed to tell he white lies and make people believe that it's growing like crazy. People even think that they are profitable for long, while in fact they are still struggling with fund raising. They couldn't raise the next round so ended up doing ICO. Plus, the media also got fooled by this strategy, a lot of awards, a lot of mentions on some of the biggest news sites in the world. To be honest, that makes me less and less believe in what I read on the news nowadays.\n* At last, he made the company appear bigger with a lot of big C-level titles, maybe more than half of the company are CXX. It's just for the sake of ICO, people will think that it's a well established company to invest in. And so far, I guess they are doing a pretty good job with it.\n\nWell, I'm just glad I got out of it.",

            "comment": "I can't believe the comments here aren't pointing this out the last sentence, \"I wasn't fully invested\" to me shows that you actually let him down and then when I read through your essay I think you contributed to some of the problems....So ill probably get downvoted but some of the things he suggested which you vetoed are/were actually good ideas and my guess is that you're probably a bit young. He definitely committed fraud by investing in crypto (although you have no clue he could have asked the initial investors who were tapped out for approval) with the funding but it seems like, as you said, he recognized the company was going to run out of money and unable to raise additional funding... so either way he felt this ship was going to zero and took a hail mary (to try and save your job). Some of the things you, \"put up with\" were actually good business decisions so I think you should reassess your understanding of that:\n\n  \n1. Doing an ICO (or Security Token Offering) whether scammy or not would have been extremely smart at the top of the market because there was a lot of easy money flying around. I can't tell you how many startups I met with that could have done an ICO or STO (even though regulation is a bit strange on that) that are regretting not doing it because it is way harder to raise money now period as interest rates rise. That's compared with a lot of companies with limited blockchain components and applications that have enough money to last 20 years who are very happy with their decision to do an ICO. An ICO is great because it works exactly like kickstarter, you raise money with the promise of delivering a project (that many times is only a whitepaper/idea0... you dont have to give up equity and technically it's counted as revenue on the balance sheet depending on the number of coins you allocate to yourself.\n\n  \n2. This is pretty standard. In fact companies like Palantir do something similar in New York. Basically the company saves on employment taxes (which are a bitch) and you just end up having to pay taxes on the amount of rental assistance that you are given if it's over a certain amount annually. For example in consulting my housing was paid for about 6 months and I didn't have to include it as income... some of my colleagues who spent a year on the road did have to include it as income but the company paid those taxes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. While this isn't optimal this is pretty standard behavior focusing on growing your potential customer base signing mous etc to make your company an attractive acquisition. But you are right here that this is a mistake if you're product is shit it will be harder to be acquired.  \n\n\n4. Cost savings which makes sense if you can see runway going to zero before additional funding or revenue.  \n\n\n**5. This one is the most troubling thing on your list especially since you have it in bold. This is the key trait of a good entrepreneur is constantly hustling and constantly selling. While timing is important and you can definitely pitch to early it's a chicken and egg and you have to over promise to get funding. Many companies pitch vaporware to secure their first contract or investment and then use the funding to build what they promised.**   \n\n\n6. Free labor is better than paid so trying to teach someone on the fly is also understandable. If you were a lead developer you actually dropped the ball here. If you want to progress you  need to learn how to lead and teach people  (I'm assuming you were the dev or CTO).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7. As you get older you'll notice the signs that someone is overwhelmed... if you knew she didnt know anything you should have offered to help get her started. Clearly she has some skills because she got hired as a web developer somewhere else but she was probably looking for some technical leadership.  \n\n\nI think you should actually take some time to sit back and question your assumptions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Your company doesn't have to be on the blockchain or related.  ICOs allow companies to sell shares in the form of crypto currency.  It's not for everyone though as not all investors are savvy.\n* The company can pay your rent. It can be part of your compensation package, that housing is provided.  It's not illegal but does need to be properly done to avoid issues.\n* If he doesn't care about the product that should be your first red flag.\n* Cancelled co-working membership is not that bad. Those places are not cheap and if you're bootstrapping, nothing wrong with having meetings at a Starbucks.\n* Incessantly pitched your product -  that's his job. \n* He also seems to make bad decisions on those he hires... \n\nThe last part seems like it may apply to you as well.

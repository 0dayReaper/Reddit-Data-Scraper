    "postText": "Meaning of MVP changed a lot during the last few years.\n\nFrom the tech perspective, no-code tools become popular, simple and accessible.\n\nFrom the funding perspective, you should have a product and a good traction to raise during the economic downturn.\n\nIf you're just starting your product, don't rush into building from day 1.\n\nHere's how to validate, build and launch startups time and cost-effectively: \n\n**\u2022 Launch a landing page with value proposition (few hours, $0).** Use Super.so to host Notion pages and launch site in minutes. Use templates and website builders: Webflow, Tilda, Squarespace. From the day 1 you will have the website to share and start collecting the email subscriptions. Focus on copywriting to make your thoughts right and clear (read Writing That Works by Kenneth Roman).\n\n**\u2022 Decide on a single feature you need to build.** Your goal is to figure out just one feature that is enough to build to show for early clients. Avoid fancy features, focus must-have workflow. It sounds simple but on practice it extremely hard to get rid of extra features. (read Make by Pieter Levels)\n\n**\u2022 Start with the designs in Figma (manually or &lt; $5k).** Communicate your ideas through visuals. Text and verbal conversations with your customers are abstract and difficult to interpret. When you see a visual design you effectively see the working product. Design process will also get you clarity as you'll likely miss a lot of details at this point.\n\n**\u2022 Validate: Promote, Interview, Sell.** Focus on getting first customers and interviewing them. Show them Figma designs and make sure you actually solve their problem and excite them (read The Mom Test for more). Your website will convert if you solve the actual problem and you use the right words to communicate that. Early marketing is tough and it's mainly personal / direct outreach.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce you validated, build:\n\n\u2022 **Set the deadline to launch in 1 month to 2 months max. Target $30k max to build.** There are some exceptions eg. regulations in FinTech/HealthTech but for the most startups it's a viable timeline and budget if you're serious about limiting scope.\n\n\u2022 **Don't automate, do manually first.** Don't rush to automate things before users actually use your product. Wrong automation will slow you down significantly and lock you in tech. Do ops manually, write a playbook and then automate. Hire a virtual assistent rather than dev.\n\n**\u2022 Use no-code tools to automate manual ops.** Once manual workflow is clear and you ready to automate it, use no-code tools first: Zapier, Airtable, Webflow, Retool, TypeForm etc. It'll save you time and money and make you independent from the tech team. You won't get a perfect custom UX, but early you won't need that. Most of these tools are free for early-stage startups.\n\n\u2022 **Make sure your tech team shows you demo weekly.** That should be an actual product demo that you can access and click through. Not designs/written updates etc. If you don't see regular updates \u2014 I can assure you won't release in time. Ask to record video demos in Loom to save time on calls.\n\n**\u2022 Set the goal for your launches and visualize metrics.** Without specific goals you can get into endless building mode. Avoid that at all costs. Choose few main metrics (\\~3) and visualise them to track daily (use google sheets, airtable, retool or amplitude). Metrics should be related to traction, eg. views, conversion %, signed up users/providers, numbers of actions, retention.\n\n\\--\n\nThere's much more to say about iterating the product, but the rule of thumb is to limit scope heavily, release very early, test on real users and move fast based on data. Avoid hiring developers and getting much into tech until your product is validated and you've got the first traction.",

Daily updates works great too if done right and team doesn't think it's a useless ritual. eg. I'm tweeting daily for the last 8+ months to become a better writer. The trick is to show up regularly and keep the schedule no matter what.\n\nI even have a similar article with focus on weekly demos as the simplest way to monitor the delivery on any project.",

For me at time no-code solutions feel lame too, but non-tech founders benefit more as they'll be able to manage workflow without asking the dev to.\n\nSo one additional piece of advice for non-tech founders would be to find a solid tech cofounder that will manage all the tech issues for you.

It isn't so much \"code vs. no-code,\" but rather a question of when to code.",

We understand it is a much long/intensive process because identifying this individual quintessential to the success of our project. We have the company modeled out financially/visually/with scale as well as how to go about analytics. What we have no idea on is the tech side. but could you elaborate on the recruitment of an exec being whole topic by itself? What types of things do you look for when approached? Where are great places to spot tech co founders?",

(eg. see \"[Growth](https://www.indiehackers.com/group/growth)\" group; a group is the same as a subreddit here). Just make sure it's not from a random guy with no product.\n\nJoin IndieWorldwide Slack channel and ask founders directly + meet them weekly through automated matching.\n\n[Trends.vc](https://Trends.vc) is a great way to monitor tech trends. For paid plan you'll get a community with direct access to other founders.\n\n[Trends.co](https://Trends.co) is one of the largest founders groups on Facebook. I haven't used it personally yet but heard a great feedback from some founders there.\n\n\\+ if you're not on Twitter I urge you to sign up. It's the most powerful startup community available for free. Learn to use Twitter daily and filter the noise with Lists and tools like BlackMagic.\n\nYou won't regret networking \u2014 it'll get you opportunities and sharpen your vision and product.",

Works great for typical back-office workflows or light user-facing features. Eg. \"when a user submits their email from our website I want to send them a welcome email and track in CRM\" \u2014 you can do it with Webflow + TypeForm/Tally + Zapier + SendGrid/MailerLite + Hubspot.\n\n\u2022 Custom code (dev needed). Once you validated some feature and onboarded customers, you'll need to develop the custom features for them. At this phase no-code tools usually become a bottleneck, as you can't build a perfect workflow due to limitations. That's when you need to switch to the expensive, slow but scalable \"code\" (I'd recommend full-stack JS as it's proven stack and the most popular one for the last 5+ years).\n\nTraditionally the first phase was an engineering task, but today it is much cheaper, safer and simpler to use the available \"no-code tools\". Whenever you can, go with tools. When the solution with tools feels limiting and  you're sure that the feature is needed \u2014  invest more and switch to code.",

I tell them that they don't need that, but what they do need is to validate the idea, build a very simple MVP (usually a landing page and a form will do) and get ready to be disappointed. The hardest part is not to build a product but to have people want to buy your product. The best validation is your Stripe account stats.

I'd recommend to double-down on social media to build the brand and loyal audience.\n* Newsletter (early subscribers can recommend the product to their peers, but please don't rely on viral marketing as it extremely hard to implement)\n* SEO (note: that's more about long-term growth with results in 6+ months)",

Plus, we tend to forget that people who have different jobs often do not have any clue on where to start when they have to bring people on that landing page in first place.\n\n**Validate: Promote, Interview, Sell.** This is the only where I don't agree with you. In our experience validating a market-need picturing a solution tends to produce 2 things:\n\n\\- identifying as potential customers people who express interest in a moment where they don't have to pay; when you go back to them two months later to ask money for what they seemed to like, suddenly they don't like it enough.\n\n\\- drives away other problems of the target that your startup would like to serve, which might be worth considering to leverage or solve first or on the other hand make the priority of what you solve not worthy.\n\n(i.e. silly but happened to us, everbody likes a cash management app, but have you checked if their most serious problem is that they actually don't have money left to manage?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGreat work, really, though.

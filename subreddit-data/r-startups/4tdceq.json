    "postText": "Going to be a bit of a rant ahead... maybe not all sensical or fair, but how I'm feeling right now. \n\nI work with two local startups as their lead developer and I also have some % ownership (one a decent chunk, the other a very small piece). They are both very promising and have technology built out that proves that they are viable businesses. One of them has about a hundred local businesses signed up and revenue coming in the door. The other has a sister company using it and the *plan* was to let them beta test it and continue to refine the software.\n\nUnfortunately, both companies are owned by very immature (but not young) owners who have no idea how software businesses work. They don't want to grind and let the company grow. They don't want to continue signing up businesses and develop a plan to hit the goal. They don't want to set reasonable timelines, make some money and run the race. What *do* they want then? They want to get multi-million dollar deals with half baked solutions. They go out and promise companies the world, when I tell them \"They're going to see right through you, it's obvious we have beta software.\" they do it anyhow. Instead of hitting the pavement and getting a respectable number of clients, they go pitch it for acquisition with 10 daily active users. \n\nThe worst part is that the companies they speak with aren't blunt. They don't say \"You aren't ready, go do XYZ and come back.\" They drag them along and let them play out these fantasies of a 10 million dollar paycheck. I've heard their plans for how they're spending these checks several times over the last year. We lost the last 3 months because they couldn't focus on anything else other than the prospect that says \"Oh, it's close to a done deal, just waiting on the paperwork\". Guess what? It fell through this week, big surprise. \n\nIf you want to be rich without having to do the grind to make it happen, don't start a company. Go play the lottery. Don't live in this imaginary world where all you need is a good idea and someone to build it and people will just start knocking down your door with money. It takes time, hustle and hard work. \n\nTLDR: Focus on building your company, not what color your lambo is going to be.",

Startups are just small businesses, small businesses are hard af to build (especially to lambo levels), people forget that.\n\n\nI would add to this that investment =/= success. So many people think that if you get a large amount of investment you're made, often times it actually screws you and a hard grind with much less money would have been a lot better.",

Because it's about the search for a business model (rather than only the execution of one), parts of a business can flow into and out of the state of being a startup. By this definition, startups become \"small businesses\" when they begin executing on their (supposedly validated) business model.",

When I think of the term \"small business,\" I think of a franchise owner, a freelancer, a privately owned dry cleaning store, a nieghborhood bakery, or a \"ma and pa shop,\" etc.  \n  \nThese are just the connotations/colloquialisms that I personally associate with the two terms. There's obviously some overlap and room for other interpretations.\n  \n&gt;Startups are NOT small businesses. Startups have the intent from day 1 to find a scalable business model and take over the world. Small businesses (by definition of the US small business association) \"are not dominant in their field\". That's a very fundamental difference in intent, approach, attitude, team building, and execution. The rest of your points are well taken.  \n  \nWhile I believe that you can have a tech 'start-up' without a 'take over the world' intent, it's unusual to see a small tech company remain static for long; this is just a result of working in technology (because technology changes so quickly). Either it will offer a service so useful that it comes close to saturating its market, or a better (more scaleable, more functional) product will take it's place.  \n  \nThe only example of healthy start-up (that I can think of) without a 'boom or bust' mentality is something that only has local importance.  Maybe an app that only pertains to a given city/location/region?  \n  \nThat being said, even if your start up has huge aspirations, you still have to start small, put in the time/effort, etc. There is this notion that a 'start-up' is a sprint, whereas a 'small business' is a marathon.  I have never owned/operated a small business or a start up, but from what I have observed, this this is ***FAR*** from the truth 99.9% of the time.",

Frankly, \"not really focused on growth but trying to achieve it\" is basically nonsensical. We didn't stumble into 10,000 paying users by accident.\n\nI literally just said we're focused on growth. We're growing faster right now than we ever have, and continually expanding our efforts to find avenues to grow faster. The nature of bootstrapping is that you need to take a longer-term, slower-growth approach, but we still want to grow as fast as we can given the bootstrapping model.\n\nIt sounds to me like your definition of \"startup\" is \"company that's raising money so they can get a huge cash injection and grow as fast as they can in the immediate short term, damn everything else to hell\" -- which, well, that's fine, I guess, there's no objective definition of a startup so you can kinda say whatever you want about who is and isn't one, but that seems stupidly narrow.",

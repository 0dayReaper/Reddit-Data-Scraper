How do you get investor (or other) feedback on your pitch deck to make sure it's done well? \n\nOur main obstacle has been finding someone who has been through the process of raising VC funding. It seems you get varying feedback from a lot of people; so figured the best feedback is the one from someone who actually raised from VC's.",

I work with concept based startups and have seen a number of pitch decks and often times they have little if any information on them and they wonder why nobody is responding.\n\nAlso you can look at pitches from companies graduating from accelerators to get an idea of how a pitch deck might look.  They used to put these pitches on youtube.  I don't know if they still do though.",

You would be able to set a minimum and maximum price, and you could set the amount of times you want the prices to be updated (every few days, etc). Why or why not?\n\nAdditionally, would you use an extension of this app which gives you the best price based on your competitors' prices?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: This works very well for cheaper products. However, if they are more expensive and/or only sell every couple of days, the time between the price updates would just have to be increased.",

For a third party product I would be interested in trialing it, but I worry that being in a competitive market might make it hard to get right and customers don't like unpredictable prices. If I saw a product at a lower price I would wait if I saw it go up. \n\nOn the other side, I do/have used a number of plugins that do this. It slows down my impulse purchases a decent amount. Don't think it is good for the vendors either. There are things I wanted and have been waiting for them to go back down for years. Apparently I didn't want them that much.",

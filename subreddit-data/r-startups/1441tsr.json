Then after some of the traction, they pitch their products in conferences, meetings, through digital marketplace sales webinars etc.   \n\n\nIn the initial part of the marketing of your company, the right noise you make in the right place is more important than the marketing asset. The noise needs to be consistent, linear and bold for you to grab the attention. \n\nAnd believe it or not, communities are the best place for that!",

I think e-learning is a relatively crowded space as is the one that I work in (future of work / talent tech).\n\nOne thing I've found is that since so many messages sound similar, testing out weird (sometimes) guerilla marketing tactics that just throw stuff against the wall - so like we basically stood outside of a big job fair in NYC and handed out QR code flyers to immediately sign up; we've posted on channels as basically anonymous users, matching tone to evangelize without being sales-y; we hosted an event that sounded sexy just as a networking event, did not 'pitch', (and it was cheap) but had everyone sign up as part of RSVP.\n\nOne other thought depending on your monetization strategy is that a lot of service providers (WeWork, coding schools, professional memberships, etc.) like being able to offer promotions and discounts to their customers that cost nothing to them. So finding ways to be listed in that (''25% off your first year subscription'') both increases your exposure and gives you credibility because you're piggy backing off of a larger brand.\n\nWould love to learn more about being effective in FB communities, that's on the list for us.",

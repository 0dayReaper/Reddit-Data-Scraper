    "postText": "Hey reddit startup!\r  \n\r  \nWe're a health IT SAAS startup that's pre-revenue with an MVP, currently applying to the app stores. We've scrapped it together thus far with contract development, but are looking to make our first hire of a full-time developer to help support and flesh out the app going forward. That person could have a trajectory toward CTO if so desired. What sort of comp range and equity should we be offering to attract decent talent?\r  \n\r  \nOther relevant/maybe relevant info:   \n\\-React native app   \n\\-Midwest based, but virtual is fine   \n\\-Two founders, one is tech but doesn't code (product guy)",

            "comment": "Your first full time hire should be a seasoned senior developer.\n\nYou should probably be looking at ~$150,000-$250,000 a year plus equity as a starting point. With some wiggle room depending on your area.\n\nDon't hire anyone who ask for less than $100,000. You're not getting a good deal. You're getting an expensive problem.",

            "comment": "I agree that your first FT dev hire should be a senior one. Don't make the mistake of going the 'budget hire' route this early. What you save in salary will be more than offset by the headaches of hiring inexperienced/immature people. It will slow you down and distract you from achieving your goals.\n\nIn terms of comp: I'm not familiar with salaries where you're located (I'm in Canada), but generally a mix of salary + equity would probably be the most attractive \u2013 maybe \\*up to\\* 1% depending for early hires. Keep in mind the softening in the economy and the startup landscape since early last year though. Lots of senior folks are actively looking, so your comp package has to be strong and flexible. Don't just focus on salary and/or equity either \u2013 the broader definition of comp also includes flex/vacation time, remote/hybrid work, health insurance etc. Build the strongest, most competitive, most flexible comp package you can given what you can afford. And when you're recruiting, remember to place high emphasis on what you're building and the problem your health startup is trying to solve. This is as important \u2013\u2013 if not more \u2013\u2013\u00a0than comp to many people. Sharing a common mission is the glue that will keep your team together regardless of what they're paid.",

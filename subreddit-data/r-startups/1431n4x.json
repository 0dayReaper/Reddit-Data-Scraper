    "postText": "Hey guys, we are designing a startup. By now, we need to estimate the marketing costs across different channels, such as social medias instagram/facebook/google/titktok/reddit, even TV/radio, and so on... how is that usually done, getting in touch one by one, such going into what the costs would be like instagram, facebok, etc.. or what? Are there some site/automated tools where we can simulate what those costs would be like filtering like country/city, etc?\r  \n\r  \nlet me know if there's anything that's not clear. Thanks in advance",

            "comment": "Yes, one-by-one would be the most accurate. You can't just throw them all together and estimate costs: TV/radio, for instance, will have far more expensive CPCs for, say, a software product, than LinkedIn.\n\nI'd do this:\n\n1. Research average CPC by industry for these different platforms.\n2. Research average conversion rate by industry\n3. Decide how many users you want to try to get through ads (multiply 1 and 2)",

            "comment": "Usually the highest cost is via PPC. Everything else costs more upfront, but works out cheaper in the long run (but the upfront cost might be high or you might have cashflow problems). \n\nIf you want 1000 USA visitors, it would cost you anywhere between $500 to $10,000 depending on your niche (could be higher or lower - but ball park figure would be something like $3/click). 1-2% of the traffic would usually purchase. \n\nNow if you want to build a page that gets 1000 USA visitors/week (say from social media or organic posts), you would still end up spending $500-$10,000 (depending on the niche). But some of that cost would be your time itself. \n\nTL;DR: not easy to answer your question. But just go with PPC estimates and then go with the assumption that this would be the most expensive traffic (everything else would cost less in terms of $, but would take more time).",

Because the longer you do marketing on it, then only you will get good results.  But you have to decide the budget yourself.",

Firms will typically specialise per channel and be able to give you a breakdown of their estimate. \n\nIf you can wave a juicy budget in front of them then they may provide the quote and research for free.\n\nThe truth is that costs vary a lot by channel, the quality of your content, and the market that you are in.",

If you are gonna launch a startup, identifying your competitors is a must, researching your buyers persona is an essential step.\nWhy?\nYou don't wanna invest in ads that will only increase your likes or followers .. you might wanna reach your actual targets with the cost that you spend. As a startup, each penny spent should be accountable for.\nNow that you have identified your niche market and your channels think about investment.. plan your KPI before deciding on how much to spend.. allocate a budget for this, while you are doing this you will need no help figuring out how much ads are gonna cost you.\nIn the end you might have more budget for impactful ads rather than scattering it everywhere. Hope this helps \ud83d\ude04",

            "comment": "Having a professional marketer can be very helpful, but if you don't have one, you can consider seeking assistance from an agency or exploring it on your own. Platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Google, TikTok, and Reddit offer online advertising services. You can directly register for an advertising account on their official websites. Once you have access to your account, you can choose your target audience, keywords, ad formats, and other relevant information. The system will then calculate the cost per impression or cost per click for you. Additionally, you'll need to estimate your website conversion rate and use a conversion funnel to estimate the cost per registered user or cost per lead. This information will help you allocate your budget effectively.",

    "postText": "In this second part I'll explain some reasons I dislike the common advice of 'scratch your own itch' as a general rule and some red flags to avoid. I'd posted this recently as a comment, but thought more of you might get value from it.\n\nSee part 1 here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/13p3jgl/how\\_to\\_generate\\_business\\_ideas\\_p\\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/13p3jgl/how_to_generate_business_ideas_p_1/)\n\nThe advice to \"solve a personal pain point\" is only good advice if the kind of pain you have is experienced by others like you...\n\n1.) frequently OR\n\n2.) With great enough amount of pain AND\n\n3.) your solution is at least 10x better than what they\u2019re currently doing to solve the problem.\n\nNext:\n\n1.) Are they actively trying to solve it?\n\n2.) Have they spent money trying to solve it? If so, how much? If not much\u2026 red flag\n\n3.) If yes to both, can you EASILY find others just like them? If no, red flag.\n\n4.) Next, how easy is it to educate someone on your solution on a scale of 1 to 10.  If higher than a 3\u2026 red flag!\n\nOther red flags:\n\n* B2C\n* Long sales cycles\n* Bad founder/go-to-market-strategy fit (you won\u2019t do it if it\u2019s not something you enjoy)\n* More than one revenue stream to make the numbers work\n* low profit margins\n* food/beverage\n* Brick and mortar\n* physical goods with no IP and ability to defend it\n\nA business might be able to weather some of these red flags provided (as obviously some do) IF they have enough funding, runway, or high enough margins... however they're given as general advice to steer away from for a number of reasons. Happy to discuss!",

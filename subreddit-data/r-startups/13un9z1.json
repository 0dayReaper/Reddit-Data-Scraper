    "postText": "Hi,\r  \n\r  \nIm a (very) early stage startup founder based in Sydney (aus), my past work experience (construction/engineering) isnt necessarily related to my business idea, its more of your traditional \"tech\" startup and we can leave it at that. But I feel like in order to execute, I need to be confident and proficient in sales/marketing, which I have zero experience in. I want to get a job in sales to get some skin in the game and learn the basics.\r  \n\r  \nI have got some job offers doing tech sales and your classic door-door/ cold call hot water/solar sales stuff. Im leaning towards the solar stuff, because frankly, it seems more brutal and more of a hustle. Also more likely that I will be forced to face unwilling customers and rejection. The money also seems potentially better, but I am more after the skills/ experience to use for my business in the future..\r  \n\r  \nAny suggestions on the best way to get meaningful experience, or past personal experiences would be appreciated.\r  \n\r  \nCheers!",

Some times it best to just buy your leads for example. Other times its best to hire lead generation people in South East Asia etc. Sometimes you need a call center. It all comes down to what you are doing.\n\nAnyways experience assembling a funnel is really the key.\n\nInserting yourself or someone who can sell is surely an important part but someone thinking in funnels will get a script/deck/pitch setup that they can train and hire. If you pitch enough you\u2019ll be as good as this guy: https://youtu.be/RXJKdh1KZ0w",

    "postText": "I'm actively seeking a driven co-founder for my side venture which is in the wellness space (B2B). (Based in Hyderabad, India). Note: It's a physical product.\nA little about me: I've previously co-founded an edtech startup, scaled it to thousands of users and currently work as a PM. (2 YOE in the IT industry)\n\nI'm looking for someone who shares my passion for entrepreneurship and is ready to roll up their sleeves to tackle any challenges that come our way. I'm incredibly passionate about doing something of my own and thus direly looking for people (preferably female) who have the same wavelength.\n\nIf this is something that excites you then please feel free to reach out to me.\n\nPS: Already tried YC co-founder matching, did not help much.\n\nEdit: Since this post has garnered views and a few people are inquiring about the idea, I'm posting it here so that only genuinely interested individuals can reach out.\n\nThe idea is basically a sustainable, eco-friendly, non-toxic, aesthetically pleasing fragrance bar as an air freshener.\nThis will be an alternative to the traditional solutions aka odnil, aer bar or zippers that are extensively used in India. \n\nPlease go through this notion document to know more (TAM, value proposition, existing solutions etc): https://carnelian-television-1bb.notion.site/Elevate-your-Home-Fragrance-Game-with-Handmade-Fragrance-Bars-69195925bd9f42af9d957d605f7d2c87",

As well as your current product experience  and the new product/space?\n\nI\u2019m originally from Hyderabad but have done a startup in a CXO capacity for 7+ years in B2B SaaS/marketplace hybrid space in Singapore. Generated aggregated revenue of $15Mn+ and have just exited. Male of 35 years of age. Curious about the Indian startup ecosystem. Might be able to put you in touch with people in my network if things pan out.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, my first time posting on this subreddit, so please be patient.\n\nWe\u2019re building a product that heavily relies on user data. We are collecting github and linkedin logins via oauth and the product requires uploading files which contain more information etc. \n\nOur business is definitely about using this data and reselling it. This got us thinking about our privacy policy and end user license agreement (EULA) to protect ourselves and to let users know that their data will be used and also explaining how it will be used.\n\nSo my question is, are there some standard templates of EULA/Privacy Policy I can use? We can\u2019t afford a lawyer and so custom crafted versions will be hard to do. What do other founders do? \n\nAlso at what stage do these things become important? When do people typically do it?\n\nWe are very early stage. No funding, no registration, just a teeny product launched last week and 30 users. Should we even worry about this right now?",

If you can\u2019t afford it, maybe go to the local college with an attached law school and see if they have some sort of entrepreneur program where you can get the law students to do it for you. It will not be optimal, but might tide you over until you can afford to get professional help.",

There are a couple of differences between these agreements worth knowing \\[1\\]. Privacy Policy is to disclose the collection and use of user data (including social logins \\[2\\]  and then T&amp;C to cover the rules and guidelines for users to follow in order to use the software (i.e. user generated content, etc.)\n\nFor example, if you have an app and you would like to have a custom EULA that replaces the default EULA provided by the App Stores, then the agreement needs a couple of provisions in order to meet the minimum requirements. For example, from Apple:  \n\n\n* Acknowledgement to disclose users that your EULA is between you and users, not between users and Apple\n* Scope of License\n* Maintenance and Support\n* Warranty provision\n* Product Claims provision\n* Intellectual Property Rights\n* Legal Compliance provision\n* And others\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/differences/](https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/differences/)\n\n\\[2\\] https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/privacy-policy-social-login/",

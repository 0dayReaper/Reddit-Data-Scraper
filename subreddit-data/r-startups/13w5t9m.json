    "postText": "So I fell ass first into a modicum of success and I'm not sure how to take it to the next level. \n\nFirst off, I'm an engineering founder, which means I only truly know how to solve problems with technology. Unfortunately I am now past that point in my journey and I need help from someone with the right skillset. \n\nI am running a dead simple ai powered b2b tool to help founders validate their startups. I have been listed on dozens of ai product websites, people talk about it on twitter and linkedin, i'm doing about 600 uniques a day, 100 of them convert to giving me their business idea to validate, probably 10-20 per day buy a report. Sounds good, but I don't have the skills or expertise to bring it to the next level. My question is: what do I do now?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo I hire a marketing firm? If so, what do I look for? Do I give a chunk of the company to someone to manage things like SEO and advertising? Is that even a viable option? Do I go hard on things like affiliates and referrals promotions? Do I try to find influencers and if so, how? Do I just sell the business to someone at a discount and let them handle it? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not looking for an easy answer, I am just genuinely unsure how to proceed and I feel like I'm squandering a nice opportunity.  Any input/experience is appreciated.",

Yet you created this tool that there's a clear market need for.\n\nA fairly seasoned marketer can definitely get it rolling for you, but you need to be clear on a mission. If you really want out, there are likely dozens of potential suitors or even established players you could sell the tool to. \n\nBut at the end of the day, it's really what do you want this to be?",

            "comment": "Imo exploring affiliates and referrals makes the most sense because other than the time and cost of a referral management system the acquisition costs are only incurred on the discounted revenue. SEO is different from advertising, that would be the next area I would explore because it takes time for SEO to gain momentum... but you have a great start given that you've been listed in a ton of places. Google Search PPC  is usually the first place to explore when looking at paid traffic. You are paying to appear when people search for certain things and you only pay when someone clicks, experiment with it and see if you can get enough clickers to become payers to make up for all the ones who dont pay. From there targeted ads on linkedin or twitter are probably the best bet to explore display-type advertising. You can granularly target your ideal audience on these platforms and there are already built-in communities drawing the people you are after to these platforms. Again try to go with freelancers over marketing agencies, just because you will get a lot more bang for your buck. You can have dud freelancers, but you can also have dud agencies. So try to vet well and get referrals.   \n\n\n  \nThis is exciting and new territory to be in, if you lock in the marketing side of things over the next 6-12 months then if you still want to sell, you will be in a much better position to do so. I say strap in for the ride, try to hire a couple key people to help you grow this thing and really give it a go to reach the next level.",

Like someone already mentioned, it ultimately comes down to what your end goal is with your business.  \n\n\nAre you looking for an exit? Or have a long term vision you want to commit &amp; execute?   \nThere are many paths you can take here, hence the uncertainty, which is totally understandable.  \n\n\nBut from what you described it sounds like a nice bootstrapped project that generates some extra income. Getting the right marketing is definitely important, but no need to overdue/overkill.   \nThat being said, if you'd want to throw some ideas around, founder to founder, you can ping me.",

Having scaled multiple startups I have seen this problem far to often, so do not worry you are not alone, this is normal process. You need to make up your mind of what exactly do you hope to get out of your product, do you want to become a serious startup founder, or is it more of a side hustle?   \n\n\nThese are the kind of questions you need to ask yourself as both SEO and advertising will require commitment of your capital, resources and time from your side. You have an interesting product, with a potential of growth, if you are serious about scaling, I can help you let me know by sliding into my DM..",

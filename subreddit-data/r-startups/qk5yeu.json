It spans a wide range of activities, including 1) how much to put into an emergency savings fund, 2) why investing your cash is so important, 3) how to allocate your cash between 401(k)s, HSAs, 529s and IRAs, 4) what to invest in within each of those accounts, 5) a plan for achieving goals such as a down payment or retirement and 6) strategies for minimizing your taxes.\n\nMany younger folks are unfamiliar with financial planning as they typically do not have a lot of assets and are simply focused on starting their careers and balancing their budgets. Traditionally, financial advisors, but because they are rather expensive services, it typically does not make economic sense for most folks until well into their 40s and 50s when they have sufficiently complex situations. However, because of the power of compounding returns, the earlier a person engages with financial planning, the more effective their money is.\n\nOne of the challenges with financial planning is that it\u2019s hard for people to focus on long term goals that can span decades. Progress towards those goals simply aren\u2019t tangible and it\u2019s easy to get knocked off course. We believe that by engaging with your money and focusing on small discrete steps, it\u2019s much easier to build up the strong habits that are needed for financial success over the long run. A focus on financial wellness and on reducing one\u2019s anxiety with money can be a much more successful method of making money a partner in one\u2019s life, as opposed to a source of unhealthy dependency.\n\n**What life cycle stage is your startup at?** We are launching our prototype / MVP in the next week!\n\n**What goals are you trying to reach this month?:** User feedback / validation\n\n**How could** r/startups **help?:** Check out the website and let us know",

If we stockpile supplies before their arrival, we can have bigger crews that stay there longer and grow a sustainable habitat with reliable low speed, lost cost freight shipping.

Also make the pitch about how you have amazing new engine tech.\n\nIf you get their attention then you know people in industry will see it.",

API Bakery is a backend code generator for REST/JSON API services that creates clean, documented and tested code for your favorite web framework. [Here's a quick tour of how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ACWv8NZWCo).\n\nWe're currently in **validation** phase, having built support for Django and Node platforms. We're doing market outreach through various channels (cold email, content marketing, word of mouth, etc - except paid promotions). I'm the founder, CEO, and everything else, as this is a solo effort at the moment, working full-time on this.\n\nThree goals for November:\n\n* marketing - steadily putting the word out there about the service, writing a few more blog posts, proceeding with our cold email camapign\n* discovery - get more feedback from new users to inform feature prioritization, improve marketing/copy and optimize sales and onboarding\n* tech - churn out a few (small) new features\n\nThat's a lot! That said, I'm bootstrapping this so slow &amp; steady wins the race.\n\n**How r/startups can help**: this is a community of builders, many (most?) working on software and/or internet-powered startups, so I think there's overlap with my target market.\n\nIf you are building products that involve backend APIs, **give API Bakery a spin** and let me know whether you think it is, or could be, useful, what's missing, what's confusing or just doesn't make sense to you, and any other thoughts you might have.\n\nIf you're not building software including backend services, you likely have friends in your network that do. **Help me get the word out there** - tell them about API Bakery.\n\nWe already have a launch discount of 50% (bringing the monthly price to $10/mo). If you decide to subscribe to API Bakery, I'll throw in **additional 50% discount for r/startups members**, lowering the monthly price to $5/mo. All I ask for in return is feedback. Lots of feedback :-D",

            "comment": "Hello all,\n\nI have two for the price of one :)\n\n**First, a project I\u2019ve just wrapped up development for and entering beta testing:**\n\n**Startup Name / URL:** Maia ([https://www.maiaml.com](https://www.maiaml.com))\n\n**Location of your headquarters:** New York City\n\n**Elevator pitch:** Maia is a platform to help anyone create an AI to make predictions about data at the click of a few buttons, just by uploading a CSV or Excel file and deciding what to predict. \n\n**Life cycle:** Validation. I\u2019ve just wrapped up development for an open beta and am now in the process of having people test out the features and collect feedback, catch bugs, and make improvements as necessary. The initial launch is what I\u2019d call an MVP 2.0. Much more than just an MVP (I should have launched sooner honestly), but not the full vision of what the platform can be.\n\n**Role:** Everything. I\u2019m the founder, developer, and now the marketer :) Would definitely be interested in partnering up with a data scientist or data engineer as a co-founder, though.\n\n**Goals this month:** I would like to have at least 10-25 *active* users on the platform by the end of the year. Not just signups that disappear and never return. I need actual users that I can engage with and discuss the product with\u2014what they think about it. What do they like? What do they dislike? What would be their ideal version of the product. I have a roadmap, but knowing what\u2019s important to the users (not just myself) is most important.\n\n**How** r/startups **can help:** Let me know your thoughts on the platform. Does it matter to you? Is it as easy as it promises to be? Did you encounter any bugs? If you\u2019re not interested, why not? Knowing the answers to these questions will be very helpful. Also, if you\u2019re a data scientist or data engineer, message me if you have time for a chat\u2014can be as quick as 2 minutes or an hour long deep dive on your thoughts.\n\n**Discount for** r/startups**:** It can\u2019t get much more free than free :)  \nBut seriously, if you are truly interested in the product, let\u2019s chat and we can works something out if you start running into paywalls or quota limits. The free version is typically enough for most people, though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Second, an idea that\u2019s just begun (and in need of validation):**  \n\n\n**Startup Name / URL:** Jobly ([https://www.jobly.ai](https://www.jobly.ai))\n\n**Location of your headquarters:** New York City\n\n**Elevator pitch:** Software engineers and web developers get flooded with recruiter emails and emails for job openings all the time (especially once you hit the 2+ years of experience mark). At first, these emails are exciting, but eventually, it almost becomes spam and difficult to sift through--and mostly ignored.   \nJobly aims to change this by using AI to pick out, organize, and save relevant emails for you, using traits you tell it are important to you. When you\u2019re ready to job hunt, Jobly will have all the useful emails ready for you to review.\n\n**Life cycle:** Discovery. I believe this is a problem for software engineers and web developers (and surely other industries with high demand), but need to validate how much pain there is and if the target market wants a solution.   \nI\u2019ve built software of this general scope and scale before and know how I aim to develop Jobly, but want to get initial validation before committing to a long-term project.\n\n**Role:** Everything. Marketer first, developer once the problem/solution is validated.\n\n**Goals for this month:** By the end of the year, I would like to have 100 people sign up to participate in the eventual beta. **100 signups** would tell me there is a problem and a desire for a solution.\n\n**How** r/startups **can help:** \n\n1. Message me with your thoughts on whether this is a problem for you. \n2. Let me know how you currently address a large volume of job-related emails. \n3. If you like the idea, sign up to join the beta\n4. Share the link with others that might be interested as well\n\nI want thoughts, feedback, and signups :)\n\n**Discounts for** r/startups**:** I don\u2019t even know what pricing will be yet :)  \nBut, I will keep track of any signups coming from r/startups and think of something once the product launches.",

            "comment": "**Startup Name** Alexandria  \n**URL:** https://gonzalobedoya10.wixsite.com/alexandria  \n   \n**Elevator Pitch**  \nFinding a balance between your social life and your learning (whether it's studying or working) is HARD. This is usually caused because of the lack of organization, where you leave everything to the last minute, and because of the lack of efficiency, where due to the amount of \u201cstudying\u201d apps in the market, when shifting from one to the other, you end up distracted and wasting time. That is why as a solution we bring Alexandria. The revolutionary app that brings together all the tools students currently use, need, and would like to have all into one app. Here are some of our features.   \n   \n **1) Documents:** We wanted to allow students to see their digital documents in a more personal way. The app allows students to import pdf files and create notebooks and documents. This functionality allows students to interact with their digital documents in two ways. One is through a more classic and less personal approach such as typed notes and scrolling through texts. The other one brings forth a newer approach of emulating paper digitally by allowing students to take hand-drawn notes or margin comments on digital textbooks. This allows the student to work in the environment they feel most comfortable in without losing the advantages of the digital world.  \n   \n**2) Flashcards:** For this, we have based ourselves in some of the most used functionality of apps like Quizlet, offering several games that will help students learn their vocab as well as more conventional and innovative ways of studying terms such as spaced repetition. We have also built upon these functions by giving the student a dictionary and translator, making the process of creating flashcards and looking for definitions and meanings a lot quicker for the student. Flashcards created from passages of a book or document will be linked to these references and allow students easy access to their flashcards from the book and vice versa.  \n   \n**3) Linking:** One of the most frustrating things as a student is not being able to find your different files related to a specific subject. In order to solve this, we give the student the ability to link different parts of different files together. For example, when taking notes on a passage of a book one can create a link between those notes and the passage itself so that next time we want to re-read the passage we can just access it by going to our notes and clicking on the link. This helps students easily navigate the complex network of concepts that they build for each of their classes.   \n   \n**4) Goal tracker:** Students can also set goals for themselves in Alexandria. We allow users to create personalized goals with different time frames, a concept similar to the one used in fitness tracking apps where users can monitor their health and be inspired to achieve objectives. Similarly, we want to inspire students to set achievable and quantitative goals that help them stay motivated and on track with their academics. The app will also suggest the most suitable goals to follow separating by days the amount of pages/minutes one must read before the deadline.   \n   \n**5) Teams:** The app will also incorporate a team section where students will be able to create groups, either with their class or among friends where they will be able to share books, notes, flashcards, and goals. Students will also be able to collaborate on shared documents online while improving each other\u2019s understanding through their individual perspectives. This feature motivates students to work together to achieve a better understanding of their classes.  \n   \n   \n**More details:**  \n**Role:** Co-founder   \n**What life cycle stage is your startup at:**  \nThe app is currently in the last phases before entering the Beta period. Once we launch it, the app will initially be available on all Apple products (computers, ipads, iphones). However, within our first year, the app will be available on all devices regardless of the brand or model.   \n   \n**How could** r/startups **help?** Give us your feedback and join our journey by following our small community on Instagram and by subscribing to our beta period.  (This is possible by using the link provided above)  \n**Discount for** r/startup **subscribers?**  \nIf interested in joining our beta period, the sooner you join, the greater the discount received when the Alexandria is officially launched. The first 500 receive 100% discount, the next 600 receive 80% discount, the next 800 receive 60% discount, the next 1,100 receive 40% discount, the next 1,500 receive 20% discount, and at last the last 2,000 receive 10% discount. A 5% discount will still be given for those who join the Beta period after the last 2,000 users. \n\n\\*All discounts offered work only during year 1",

Our aim is to democratize the powerful resources traditionally made available only to financial advisors. \n\n**Why did you make this?**  \nPeople need serious financial planning tools. The internet is giving people more power than ever to take control of their personal finances. Unfortunately, many popular retirement calculators on the web today have major shortcomings. And we expect a lot of folks don\u2019t realize how ill-suited some of these tools are for long-term planning.\n\n**Our Free MVP**  \nTo start, we\u2019ve built a portfolio/retirement model with professional-grade simulation capabilities, and it\u2019s 100% free to use.\n\n**Why is it free? How do you make money?**  \nWe\u2019re a startup; we don't make money, but we're great at spending it. We're trying to attract early adopters to build a brand and encourage feedback.\n\n**Why do I need an account?**  \nWe\u2019re scaling this on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the computational requirements are extensive. With monthly compounding and 10,000 trials, the simulation engine requires tens of millions of calculations and random variables for every run. We're less than two months old, so we\u2019re still learning as we grow our user base. Until we know exactly how much it's going to cost to keep everything running in the cloud, we need to filter for bot traffic and other tomfoolery. We want to give folks a free and powerful tool. But we also need to cover our tail until we have a better idea of the ongoing overhead costs.\n\n**What do you want from users?**  \nYour feedback; we want to make the best tool(s) possible. In order to do that, we need to know what you like, what you don\u2019t like, and what other features you\u2019d like to see.",

You'll see lot more people leaving without understanding how to use the product.\n\nThat's why i won't recommend this strategy in B2B or Enterprises. As they are big and complex products.

It's not just you asking - it's you and everyone else.

One of the app's features is a custom website we give to each subscriber. To increase conversion, we're thinking go through these steps. Not sure if it makes sense. Collect email address. Take leads to the website builder right away, more like a preview. We will show the rest of the features in a dashboard but they will be disabled. Leads can try the site builder freely. At this point, all without logging in or creates an account. If they want to proceed, they can then choose a plan, and subscribe. I think this is much better than having leads to choose a plan, then pay for it, then use the app. This way, the leads can at least try out the major feature which is the website builder.

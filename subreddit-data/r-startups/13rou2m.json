Could anyone here recommend what are some forums I can join and meet more people?  \nWhat I am looking for is to build some new connections and build a circle that can share/empathize each other startup journey experiences and learn.  \nOne thing I am realizing at this early phase is how lonely one can feel as most of my friends and family cannot relate to the struggle it takes to move and push forward.",

There are usually many founders.  \nAnd Finally as a lifehack - apply for any job for the early-stage startups, founders, are usually hire personally :)",

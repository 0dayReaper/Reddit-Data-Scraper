    "postText": "Grateful for advice. Have done a couple of interviews so far. My interest is health prevention and allowing people to track and improve their lifestyles over time. I don't have a specific idea set in stone but have some features I think could be useful for an MVP but am doing discovery for this. My issue is that I am still speaking to people and the few I've spoke to so far use wearables and have data over 2-3 different apps but are not fussed about making any further use of this data. To the contrary, I have come across threads on reddit of people wanting a tool that allows them to correlate their own variables they track including blood tests and habits, mood, etc - those communities don't allow surveys sadly.\n\nTempted to make a landing page and try some pay per click with a landing page to see what interest htere may be but also aware this doesn not equal paying users.\n\nI have read mom test and am reading through the books on strategyzer, and have listened to the YC talks and startup school so trying to do things 'by the book' but it is a lot to do and then process and make sense of!",

Worth finding a problem first, then generate solutions and measure the efficacy of each solution iteration with those interviewees\n\nI'm not doing it for feature ideas, and am well aware of confirmation bias. I'm trying to scope how people manage their health by determining what they do and have done and what they struggle with. Have not mentioned any features or potential ideas to anyone. I have the problem in mind and am asking open questions from there. I suspect I need to niche down a little more. There are a few players in my market doing similar things.\n\nThe feature ideas mentioned was what I gleamed from reading forums rather than coming from myself. Although I think tracking and correlating health related variables will be useful, I think there are many ways people can contribute to good health and am trying to figure this out. I agree that my post makes it seem like I've gone out with confirmation bias. If anything, so far, my 'idea' is not validated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I'm still learning and imagine I have some way to go :)",

But, like any other Shit Sandwich, I have to point out a few \"bad\" things.   \n\n\n&gt;My issue is that I am still speaking to people \n\nDon't frame this as an issue. You will forever talk to people and learn from them in order to make and keep your business successful.   \n\n\n&gt;and the few I've spoke to so far use wearables and have data over 2-3 different apps but are not fussed about making any further use of this data.\n\nThis sounds like you are validating the wrong thing and don't know who your customers are - create different customer segments and buyer personas and then validate which one would be a better fit early on. Then for tech early adopters and/or fitness enthusiasts you can focus on how they might want to use their data but for everyone else you have to know what they do in their day to day and how does it align with the information you found elsewhere about the problem you want to solve.  \n\n\n&gt;The challenge is to get people to give up and schedule some time without an incentive. Ideally, one could argue that if someone is interested enough in the problem\n\nThat argument is silly. People might want to discuss their problems but only if they get value out of that. Be it them venting, looking for sympathy, looking for companionship, or looking for solutions and everything in-between.   \n\n\n&gt;Tempted to make a landing page and try some pay per click with a landing page to see what interest htere may be but also aware this doesn not equal paying users.\n\nThe landing page combined with paid ads test is super powerful if done right - I've used it to validate my own business idea (if you are curious how it's on my substack) but don't just do this. I would recommend to boil down your target audience so much that you know where in your city you can find them. Then, engage with them to learn about their problems and how you as an individual could solve them even if it is you sending them an SMS/email/WhatsApp message etc every few days with some stats or recommendations.   \n\n\nGood luck! Product discovery and validation is one of the most fulfilling and exciting things in the early stages. :D",

You can then decide whether what you idea is will helpful or if you should pivot. \n\nI\u2019d start by outlining your customer segment then creating a few assumptions/hypothesis about if this is an actually problem or if they\u2019d be open to help in the area. Then mark you hypo as validated or invalidated after every interview. If DTC do at least 20. If B2B do at least 10 interviews. \n\nThe landing page could be a good way to capture potential customers to interview. Avoid incentives as they bring bias into the discussion. Surveys will only get you so far",

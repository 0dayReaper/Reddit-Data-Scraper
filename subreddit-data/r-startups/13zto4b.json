Instead try to find people to use your product and give you feedback. \n\nYou don\u2019t need money right now, you need validation that you\u2019ve built something people care about. \n\nThis is classic product development folly. Build it, and they will come. It\u2019s the source of why many peoples ideas fail, they build something they think is awesome, and then point money into trying to find customers and get people using it. \n\nFocus on validating your product is something people care about. Once you\u2019ve had like 40-50 conversations and you can confirm it\u2019s a real problem, and you can get people to pay for it, then think about marketing. Maybe. But for now, find people on Reddit, Twitter, user bob, mechanical Turk, linked in, Facebook, anywhere you can. Your personal network.\n\nYou need validation more than users. Priorities first.",

            "comment": "I'm a product designer, and I think that none of them will give you any value. You can't build a company with mercenaries. I have been part of a startup that just burned money on freelancers and consultants without getting much value in return. The consultants/freelancers rarely understand what your product is about because juggling between multiple clients. And for them, you are just their paycheck. They don't care about your product. They care about you as a client, but they will aim to make you happy even if the wrong decisions are made.\n\nIf you really need design in your product hire someone to become a minority-stake co-founder, or first employee with a lot of stock options. Hire someone with a broad skill set that can do user research, interaction design, UX, UI, and branding.\n\nDesign is not just branding and how it looks. Not just something you just sprinkle on top. Design is very much about how easy your product is to use.",

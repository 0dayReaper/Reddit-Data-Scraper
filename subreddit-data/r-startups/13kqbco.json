    "postText": "Hi there everyone,\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm in Malaysia, for context.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've come up with an idea and pitched it to the directors of a software dev agency, I've worked with them on some other stuff before, so we're all pretty well acquainted and one of them is actually a school friend. But this is my first time actually starting a business. I studied Computer Science for my degree, but pivoted mainly to business development for my whole career.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere's four people in the picture, including me. After months of discussions, and the tech lead creating a prototype that ended up working, all of us are pretty hyped on the prospects of this product. However, for this project to take off, I will need to quit my job and go full time. The company has decided to fund a runway for me, basically, they will cover my living expenses for the next 6 months, while we as a group make this project happen.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe BD lead of the company, suggested that we split ownership of the company squarely 25% each amongst the four of us. I told them I wanted 40%, that felt right to me. While the rest of the 60% can be shared of their own accord between the three according to their volition.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBasically the roles will be split like this:\n\n1) Me - I will be working full time on this and I will be quitting my job to fill up all of the service aspects of the product. Along with sales, pitching and everything else. I will also be investing a chunk of money, but nowhere near as much as they will be funding.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2) Tech Lead - Is a highly experienced tech guy with more than a decade of software engineering experience and running a business around it. He's got a team of software developers. He will also develop any future products along for the company.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n3) BD Lead - Has worked with Tech lead for very long, has experience in closing million dollar deals and is the main driver of revenue for the company.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n4) High school friend - He's working alongside some other projects in the company, but will be acting as a project coordinator between me and the other components of the company. He's also organizing the accounts, budgeting, and also any ad hoc support tasks alongside what I do.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe've agreed that any financial/human resource investments will be paid back if the company takes off. I thought I deserved 40% because I'm taking the biggest risk, as the other founders are going to still be working elsewhere as their main focus. They'll be funding majority of the costs to make this happen, with a 6 month salary runway for me, and 12 months of funding for the business. Besides that, I'll have access to their team of developers, designers, office space, and other resources that the company has.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDid I make the right move? Am I making the right move? Please share any advice for this situation and also in general to starting out. \n\nThanks so much.",

            "comment": "So, this is a complicated setup with a lot of moving parts, but on the face of it you are giving away 60% equity to people who are not fully invested in your project. And even if you do the 3 of them then own 20% each and depending on how much revenue the company brings in and how much that actually motivates them to work on this project is the question. You need to structure a deal where everyone is excited to be onboard. You mentioned the company is taking care of your living expenses for the next six months so in effect they are reducing your risk and put another way they are employing you so they would want to see an equity stake that reflects that. Whether this is a good deal or not depends on what you want from it. If you prefer safety then yes but if you want to bet a 110% on your company and your ability to drive it in all aspects engineering, marketing etc then no. I hope that helps.\n\nP.S. there is very little information here for anyone to provide you with any real advice. The points above just reiterated what you mentioned in a different way.",

                    "comment": "Hey, thanks so much for the advice and taking the time out to read my post.\n\nI'll be honest, I wanted to ask for 50% at first, but considering that everyone is sort of taking quite a risk by investing in me and in this business, I wasn't sure how to sort through this. I basically am coming to the table with some BD skills, my idea, and some minimal funds. I know I would not be able to do this without them. They got a working prototype done and have vast connections in the country for us to leverage. The BD and tech lead are dealing with a lot on their plate, they are employing over 30 employees, and a lot of major obligations for their company.\n\nI read that I should be giving equity according to amount of risk and time being dedicated for each founder. But these guys are actual veterans in this business, they have the resources to enable everything to make this happen, and I thought it would be fair for me to just take 40%. It honestly felt right to me, and sadly that's my only way of equating it. It felt solid. When I pitched 60% goes to them, whichever way they saw as fair, they were completely fine with it, said that it sounded fair. After our last discussion, everyone was still very excited about the project (Not sure if it's an effective indication). I rationalized it as, instead of all of us taking 25%, I'm gonna take an extra 5% from everybody else because I'm the only one going full time. But I am super lucky to have my expenses covered for 6 months. \n\nThe BD lead has a vast list of contacts in the country to connect us, the tech lead has a full team of software devs. And I see a lot of potential for bridging together now, to enable future growth and other products that might come in the pipeline if this takes off. Basically setting up the right foundation with the right people, so that I can keep building with them in the future.\n\nAll four of us see a lot of potential in this business It's basically going to be a subscription service, with very high profit margins if we hit our break even point, which is really not much at all. And it has very high scabality. When we started throwing numbers around, they actually said this might be their most profitable product if we do this right.\n\nWith all of these things noted, and you were in my shoes. Does this sound like a good deal to you?",

            "comment": "It's great that you're taking the leap and starting a business! It sounds like you've got a solid team, but make sure to have open conversations about equity distribution. It might be helpful to weigh the contributions each person is bringing to the table (finances, time, expertise, etc.) and discuss if the ownership percentages feel fair to everyone. The fact that they're funding the start-up and providing resources does have a big impact. However, it's crucial to have a clear agreement about roles, expectations, and future plans; this will give everyone a better idea about the distribution of tasks and responsibilities. Best of luck on this journey!",

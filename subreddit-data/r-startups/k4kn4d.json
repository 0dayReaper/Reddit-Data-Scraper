    "postText": "One of my employees has been struggling with chronic overworking for the past two months. She is the kind of person who monitors her emails in the evening just to make sure our client gets a prompt email reply or can make an urgent Zoom call, even though her workday starts at 7 am. For product releases, she volunteered for a few night shifts.\n\nAlthough all her overtimes and night work were compensated, money cannot instantly cure physical and mental exhaustion.\n\nI decided to reward her with a one-week vacation for two to the destination of her choice fully paid by the company. And of course, her workload for the next release will be closely monitored, as we don\u2019t want to lose her to burnout.\n\nDoes your company prevent employees from burnout? And how?",

Does she need the extra money from overtime? Or is it that she feels that is expected of her - maybe not from this job but from previous roles? Was she ever let go from somewhere?\n\nPerhaps take her out for a coffee and say how much you appreciate her but you don't expect her to work this hard and that you're concerned she might burn out, and see what she says?\n\nTo answer your question I consult for starts up and so I've been in a few. It's a massive cliche but the ones which have table tennis or fussball, or weekly yoga sessions really were the ones with the happiest employees.\n\nThis one place also had lots of break out areas and encouraged staff to take 30 mins here and there either to get some quiet time or to work with others.\n\nThey were also very conscious about who they hired, had a 'no dickheads' rule, and had regular social stuff (no pressure to attend).\n\nFinally they made an effort to do proper performance reviews and career progress talks, something start ups often forget to do.",

The job of management isn\u2019t to keep everyone overworked all the time - it\u2019s to manage workloads.  If they are chronically overworked, they need to bring in support, or deprioritize some of the work.  Burning out people isn\u2019t just startup culture, it\u2019s a stupidly bad way to employ people and retain talent.   \n\n2 weeks of vacation doesn\u2019t fix that - and a toxic work environment isn\u2019t the way to create a good product.  You can\u2019t just slap the label \u201cstartup\u201d on a company to excuse poor management.  \n\nAnd even if the employee is choosing to work this hard, you have to ask why.  A good manager will recognize this and deal with the root cause of it, not try to slap a bandaid on top after they\u2019re burned out.",

Do they have ideas for new direction, policies, or opportunities?\n\nI also implemented an unlimited time off and flex-work policy about a year ago, and I regularly encourage our employees to use it. They are expected to take at least 1-day off per month, preferably more. My mantra is \"if we can't do it without you, we don't deserve you.\" \n\nMy guiding principal is that while someone might do their job exceptionally well, you as a business owner are failing yourself and your employees if their job isn't well documented and able to be handled satisfactorily by other people at anytime.\n\nEmergencies happen, new opportunities arise, and your employees should never feel like the weight of a specific job role falls exclusively to them, even if it's their job title and you're a small team. That weight is one of the factors that create workaholics, burnout, and resentment. \n\nPlus, you being cross-trained by your employees helps you really understand the day-to-day, and creates an opportunity for you to streamline and innovate through the lense of your team's needs and desires.\n\nKeep up the great work!",

Every once in a while, fine... but there's often not a lot of situations which are really as urgent as people think.\n* Train them how to manage their own boundaries. This means talking through how to separate life and work life on their device, at home, and after work hours. Agree on some rules, follow up.\n* Aggressively protect their boundaries with them. \"These are the rules we agreed to, get off your phone.\" I've done this several times with employees, \"go home,\" \"get off Slack,\" \"don't answer anymore emails,\" etc. if I see them do it.\n* Look at their work duties with them and outsource or remove things off their plate.\n* I'm assuming you're from the U.S. which is why you said one week vacation... but typically burn-out is going to require a lot longer period to recover from because at that point it's already been going on for far longer than they've let on.\n\nPart of it is them, a lot of it is you. After a while, most of them get used to the new rules and you can let go of the constant monitoring.\n\nOne other thing, there's different types of burnout.

I think as our work environments change, technology changes and expectations of employees are constantly changing its inevitable that they won\u2019t reach that burn out level. \nI love the idea about a company sponsored vacation to decrompress and that\u2019s great, but maybe start having some team discussions on what happens when you do hit that burn out level. \n\nI for one, used to be a headhunter or a agency recruiter, made a ton of money before I was 30, then hit the burn out level. Making 100+ phone calls a day, emails, interviews, and constantly chasing that money, some months I was pulling $20,000+ and if I didn\u2019t hit that, it fueled me to put it into second gear and let\u2019s not forget about what a toxic work environment looks like when you got a bunch of high flying alpha guys sniffing cocaine to produce more and more. Ultimately I made some poor choices in how to cope with all that, and got fired spiraling my life downhill for a few years after that where I hit rock bottom. \n\nLooking back, had I a professional mentor pull me to aside, and say to me, \u201clook your contributions are amazing, we\u2019re beyond grateful, and profitable, but let\u2019s pump the breaks and enjoy the rest of the year.\u201d \n\nInstead I would skip friends, family, my beloved dog, girlfriend, I had a house in a great community that I never spent any time at because I was fueled to make money. \n\nI think employers owe it to your staff to keep an active eye on their work load, and especially if it\u2019s preformanced based with lucerative compensation packages. It\u2019s super easy to lose focus that their is more to life than client satisfaction and bringing home tons of money. Being a professional mentor is something a good professional can appreciate because that\u2019s showing them they are more important than the job itself. When you can relate to them (assuming your older and higher pay grades), on a personal level and help avoid certain pitfalls, they will respect that. \n\nTake it from me, I was vague on my experience, but I know lots of people go through something similar to what I went through, it nearly killed me in the process.",

Wanting to prove myself in the workplace and to my father\n2. Professional ambition\n3. Genuine love of learning new things and continuous curiosity\n4. Seeing insanely hard workers admired in the workplace\n5. Ultimately addictive dopamine hits from responding to emails and making progress on projects\n6. OCD (recently diagnosed): an obsession with uptime &amp; system stability leading to a compulsion of \"checking\" to make sure everything is okay\n\n\\#1 is what got me out of the slacker ways of my youth, so while it is neurotic, it can be a beneficial and near-bottomless well of motivation.\n\n\\#2 is rational.\n\n\\#3 is pure joy.\n\n\\#4 is where it gets tricky. The hardest worker is not necessarily the most productive worker. Plus, what looks like admiration is sometimes just lip-service from people who are happy to see someone else do all the hard off-hours work.\n\n\\#5 arises out of #4. It is an addiction that builds up over time. While the workahol addiction doesn't have such acutely deleterious effects as an amphetamine addiction, it does have bad long-term consequences: damaged personal relationships, poor physical health, and (sometimes) fixation on rapidly-completable tasks rather than longer-term/more strategic work. *Ideally she could channel her passion into learning and growing, not off-hours email responses* (unless she's learning from it).\n\n\\#6 - this is unhealthy and in retrospect, embarrassing. Perhaps my employers got an extra little bit of uptime from all my efforts, but regardless, it was a low-leverage activity. If obsessive/compulsive, she would ideally see a psychologist about it (though I'm not sure it'd be appropriate for you make that suggestion... it'd be worth some research). At least in the USA, we casually say \"I'm totally OCD about X\", which downplays the fact that it is 1) a real condition that 2) causes real suffering. Also, OCD manifests in many ways, not just as it is depicted in \"As Good As It Gets\" - for example, I'm laid back about most things except for work and \"being a good person.\" Because of its varied manifestations often at odds with our cultural understanding of the disorder, OCD often goes undiagnosed.\n\nHopefully she doesn't have as bad a case of workahol as I did!!\n\nWhile I'm not sure this would be effective, my recommendation centers around #5. Since she's such a hard worker, can you direct her to learn new things or take on an ambitious \"stretch\" project? Such as higher-leverage activities that would lead to meaningful professional growth. She might work obsessively on these things too, but then again work that requires focus and cognitive expansion isn't as conducive to addiction (because the feedback loops are much longer).\n\nGood luck to you both!",

It takes some effort to find something good, depending on your industry and region there is likely some good info available.\n\nAlso, peer tools are amazingly useful for sales, leadership, management, AND popping the bubble we all live in thinking we have all our shit in a row just cause we can run 10's of millions of dollars worth of projects, while we appear to be fine to those around us. This comes from someone with a book case wall of self improvement books.\n\nIn consolation: I survived my burnout without anyone being available to help, I am ultimately quite grateful now for it having happened. So if one is unsuccessful helping another, it may be a necessary \"failure\" for someone to hit a low then realize their need for self awareness and self care. It's unfortunate and dangerous, but if you're concerned, know you have skin in the outcome. It's being human after all.\n\nIf someone does begins to suffer physical or mental symptomology from burnout then having someone with some knowledge and lived experience close by to help is invaluable. As many of us know the lasting effects are significant and not quickly or easily resolved.",

It got to the point for me where it was a struggle to get out of bed in the morning.  At Workscout, we make it really easy to buy short term business projects.  My goal is to really normalize getting some work off your plate at small companies.  Check us out at shopworkscout.com",

Try to understand why she is overworking.\n\nIs it because she wants a promotion, more responsibility, your approval?\nIs it because your clients are unreasonably demanding and that is not taken into account when her performance is reviewed. \nIs it because there is too much work assigned to her?\nIs it because she is inefficient, or the processes around her work are inefficient?\n\nThe good news is that all of these issues are fixable, the bad news is that a week long vacation by itself will not solve the issue. She will just come back and be back at the same thing.\n\nBe happy that you have a dedicated employee. And try and locate the issue and fix it. Once you do that things should be fine.",

            "comment": "Since you are able to reward her with a one-week vacation, I assume you must be manager or above. This is a tough one. I think the important thing is to recognize there are various kinds of people in the world. It's kind of hard to tell if a person who is working more than others have an issue of being overworked or if being pushed to the edge is what gets them going. There are just some people who are very passionate. What indicators do you have that she is overworking? Are you confident that it's affecting her physical and mental health? Have you seen evidence of this?\n\nOne thing that could be done is talk about it in the 1:1s. Let her know that she is doing an amazing job, but that you are worried that you or the company's environment is causing her to be overworked. Try to empathize and figure out what is causing her to work so hard. If she is just passionate about the mission, then it seems all is good. At this point I would still just monitor her because even those who are passionate don't know their own limits. But if it's other factors, now you have stuff you can address together to figure it out.\n\nA good thing companies can do to not burn people out is to speak in more general terms, reduce the stress factors. A lot of this comes from things like deadlines, rapid/numerous pivots in a task or project, overly demanding requirements, etc. One common one I see in the workplace is overloading tasks on a plate. If there are a lot of meetings and a lot of work to be done, your schedule is going to look packed. Lighting the load so that employees can have time in the work day to decompress with ping pong (before covid) and coffee breaks can help the monotonousness. Stress also comes from fear of failure. Let them know that no one likes failure, but failure is not the end of the world.\n\nThese are active things you can do, but a lot of what management sets as the tone also affects burnout. How you react when things go terribly wrong? How open are you to employee suggestions to improving the workplace or work process? How do you show that their opinion is taking into serious consideration even when it is turned down (not by just saying your opinion is valued and appreciated). I feel like I am typing too much now, but these are some things that can help.",

Effective communication is the first step to communicate your issues and the management should be empathetic towards their employees.\n\n  \nHow?\n\n1. Admit that there is no 'perfect' work-life balance.\n\n2. Find a job that you enjoy.\n\n3. Prioritize your well-being.\n\n4. Don't be scared to unplug.\n\n5. Take a sabbatical.\n\n6. Make time for yourself and your loved ones.\n\n7. Set boundaries and work hours.\n\n8. Establish goals and priorities (and stick to them).  \n\n\nI believe if we work on these points Work-life balance will get better",

            "comment": "It starts with the leaders. Every individual leader within the firm has to understand that stemming this rampant issue in the workforce is one of their core responsibilities. If someone is overworking it's because something is wrong with their daily standard work, the processes they're responsible for, or the value judgements they have of themselves and their work. Having conversations to understand the workaholism is paramount to defeating it. I was a workaholic for  several years, then started working with my mentors on analysing what I mentioned above and it made all the difference. Now I'm back to a 8-9h work day and off grid after hours and on weekends. I'm also paying the mentorship and coaching forward to my many reports. Our productivity has gone up considerably over the last year as a result. \n\nBottom line: have your leaders at all levels of the hierarchy find out what the source of it is by talking with the people engaged in it and commit to solving for it. I work on topics like this in my personal development a lot at work so feel free to hit me up if you have questions on where I'm coming from.",

It\u2019s almost complete, and I now need a marketing strategist to help me get the app off the ground, and drive user engagement. \n\nI would really prefer someone to partner up with at this point as I do need some help, especially expertise in certain areas.\n\nI prefer to partner up with an individual vs. a firm, because I assume a firm will require a lot of $$$ or equity. I could be very wrong and I did reach out to 2 of them, and am waiting for a response.\n\nI thought I\u2019d jump on here to find out what those of you with a bit more experience think. Is there a specific platform I could look at or a specific method?",

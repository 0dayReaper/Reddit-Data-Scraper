    "postText": "Hi there\n\nI started my IT company 5 years ago.\n\nIn the beginning i used to cover the expenses with my own money and as the income got bigger we started to use that money for expenses. I had no salary and the net profit was really small. But i was happy that the business could pay its own bills. Nevertheless, my personal expenses were covered by my current job at the time, such as: Cellphone Plan, Fuel, Cloud Services, etc. \n\nAs we acquire more clients, those expenses espclifically went up, i had to send more emails, i had to go more places each day, more meetings, etc.\n\nAbout 2 years ago we got investment and they did a full reorganization of the company, we got more employees and i got a salary. The amount is great for cover all of my family expenses and also the expenses i talked about.\n\nBut\n\nThey gave me a credit card for business expenses. I asked specifically what kind of stuff  can i buy with it, they replied \u201cwhatever is needed for the business\u201d. I mean, we do have an acquisitions department, so i was kind of confused.\n\nI did not use the credit card in at least two years. But in March 2023 i had a family trip and spent a lot of money of my salary. When i got back i needed to refuel my car, and that was the first time i used it.\n\nI tough the investors would be mad at me or something, but somehow they were ok with that. Then my computer broke, so i got a MacBook Pro for 3000USD. Again, they did not said a thing.\n\nTo be fair, both of those things are for the business and if i hadn\u2019t started the company i would not need them.\n\nSo i decided to start paying the business related flights with that credit card and again, they are fine with it.\n\nThey are aware, i am not hiding it. I feel guilty because we don\u2019t have unlimited money and i don\u2019t want to bleed dry the company.\n\nI have to put this on the record. I am not the CEO. I don\u2019t take financial decisions and i don\u2019t choose who to hire. I am not sure exactly what i am (my title is Founder) and what i usually do is decide what ideas we gonna build, meet potential clients, and keep existing ones. One if my favorites parts of this job is that sometimes i am the one who gathers the requirements from a client, and sometimes i get to visit their companies and watch their whole processes (manufacturing, packaging, logistic) and i decide how we will help them.\n\nMoney is a new thing for me, my family was poor and i am not used to spend money with no restrictions.\n\nBut at the same time, it would be great if i could just know what a business expense is. \nWhat other kind of stuff can i charge them?\nLunch for example? Tools? Computers? CellPhone Plan? What would you do?",

Lunch in your office hometown is not expensable, unless entertaining a visiting client.\n\nLiquid evening with a client is considered business entertainment. If you are on the road and have a meal that is a business expense. Company policy dictates yea or nay on whether they will pay for a few drinks with your meal when solo.\n\nRoad trips... Company pays for gas, oil, toll roads, bridges, ferries, etc\nIf you are using your own car for biz road trips you will also expense the mileage put on your vehicle, at some company specified per mile rate.\n\nAirfare, cabs, Uber, trains, subways, etc. Is always expensable in the name of business.\n\nTools such as laptops, test/diagnostic gear,  iphones, are expensable.  \n\nBottom line: most anything that is in the furtherance of increased business and client relations is generally expensable. My old boss had built his company up to 350 million a year USD, so he bought a plane (actually, the company bought and expensed the plane). I still couldn't buy drinks for myself on the road with the company card.\n\nSounds like your company is now big enough for an HR department. Ask them for a copy of the company expenses/reimbursement policy. It's probably in the employee handbook, which given your role, you may have never seen.",

                            "comment": "Business expenses are paid by the business.\n\nI'd personally be careful about mixing business and personal, because here's the thing: once you took outside investment, it's no longer your company.  You're now just an employee, albeit a fancy one, and you can be fired.  Keep in mind that if you use your personal email / computer / cell / phone number for work, all of that becomes subpoenable in any work lawsuits.\n\nSo:\n\nAll work on a work laptop.  Work buys.  Nothing personal on it, and no work on your personal laptop.\n\nAll work calls on a work cellphone with a work number.  Work buys.  Nothing personal on it.  And no work on your personal phone.  No work on your personal email, and vice versa.\n\nWork travel you can take your own judgement, but if you're driving a ton, I'd have work lease you a vehicle.  Otherwise, you're trashing yours.  A work vehicle is solely driven to work meetings; it's never used for personal stuff.\n\nMeals away from the office are a work expense.  Meals at the office are a personal expense, unless you buy everyone in the office lunch as part of your comp.\n\n\n\nThe guiding principle is you shouldn't be out of pocket for any expense caused by you working for a company, except for travel directly to and from the office, your clothing, and meals eaten while not working (ie while not with a customer or potential customer or traveling.)",

            "comment": "Omg you were paying for your own flights?  \n\nBusiness expenses are reasonable costs assisted associated with running the business as the founder ceo your time should be spent on the $5000/hr strategy not  splitting 2 ply toilet paper in half to save a buck. \n\n\nWhen I was in the ceo seat I traveled a lot. I would expense everything but gifts for my family or things for me like a movie ticket. I tried to keep my daily spend to less than $150/day or close to the government reimbursement scale for that city which meant being in cheaper hotels and not eating steak dinners. If clients were there then yeah spending $300 on dinner is fine for business.  Do what it takes to win. \n\nI expensed my phone plan,  meals for the company and travel. I bought a new laptop every 2 years but really just took one from someone else when they upgraded.   My headphones broke so I bought really nice noise canceling ones. I needed a suit for a meeting and didn't own one so the company bought it.  In the end we spent about $1k a month on stuff.\n\nI grew up poor and had to really change my relationship to money.  It's a resource the company should use wisely but don't trade time for money. If you need it don't even ask.  Get it and keep going.  Founders should get paid a living wage and later on they should be in line with upper management. Run your cash flow if you're a multi person company $1k a month on food and entertainment won't bring in your zero dollar day an appreciable amount. \n\nAnother strategy is to expense as much as possible to your business and take a smaller comp because the business can write it off.  So instead of taking an extra $500 month in cash that's taxed have the company lease the vehicle and you just drive it.  I find as long as your meeting goals and it's not lavish investors don't care.  They aren't your many watching your bank account. \n\nIn the words of Dave Chapelle \"I'm like evil kneivel I get paid for the attempt\"",

Paid myself the least of my executive team thought I was doing it right by being invested in the business.  All I did was add stress by putting off living expenses.  Investors didn't care like if you close the big account and 10x the business they don't care whether you spent an extra 10k getting there. In retrospect I could have been paying myself 60k more a year and it wouldn't have pulled in our zero dollar day or affected our  eventually sale in a meaningful way. \n\n\nRemember you earned this.  You got here, if they had to hire an executive at market rate to do your job and hours how much would they pay?  You're worth all of that.",

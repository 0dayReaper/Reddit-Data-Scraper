I believe that focusing on the niche and delivering a high quality product targeting the needs of the users is the right approach, but it presents the difficult challenge of acquiring users from within that niche (users which tend to dislike sales and advertising). \nWhat does a usual user acquisition roadmap look like for an app product? Would people suggest expanding the audience size or continue focusing on the intended market? At what point after release would you consider change tact?",

    "postText": "\nI am 23 years old, and I\u2019m involved in two startups at the moment. One is a product company (I own 50% of the business) and the other is a luxury watch trading business (my business partner started it with another individual that\u2019s similar in age to me, I don\u2019t have equity but I run the business)\n\nMy main question is in regards to the product company that I am launching, it\u2019s a home product brand and our first product is ready to launch!\n\nWe currently have 1,260 units and I am waiting on some samples for packaging from 3 different suppliers at the moment\n\nOur original plan was to go with FBA since our product is completely unique and we spent 10 months designing and producing the product but our cost ended up being higher than expected to so \u201cpivoted\u201d to wanting to sell through our own website\n\nOnly one problem, getting traffic to our website haha\n\nHere\u2019s my options and I\u2019m interested in any opinions / advice\n\n1.\t\u2060Send out free products to micro influencers in return for content that can be utilized in Facebook ads (the ad sets will be started with a generalized target audiences with the goal of testing the actual ad copy\u2019s) then there will be a daily ad spend goal of probably $200\n2.\t\u2060Try to go with an organic route of creating a Tiktok page, myself as well as connecting with micro influencers to also create content\n3.\t\u2060Combination of 1 &amp; 2 - biggest con to option 2 is the amount of time it will take for me to personally build the brand organically\n4.\t\u2060Pay a company that specializes in building brands in Tiktok (my business partner has done this before with past products he has launched and these services are expensive, definitely work (as far as views go), and have also proved to be difficult to work with when trying to build a brand with a specific \u201cbrand image\u201d in mind\n\nI am definitely leaning towards the FB ads strategy, but if you guys have any advice as to other strategies there are or just your own experiences that would be awesome! We are probably a few months from actually launching\n\nThank you!",

Just for clarification, we did do market research, testing, and pre sale tests with early adopters. Took about a full year of prototyping, and research and I\u2019m not saying we performed the best market research any startup has ever done but I do feel confident in the information that we did gain to warrant the production of product. Also, even with the information we gained through our research we still started with a relatively small order size. \n\nMy primary question (maybe I wasn\u2019t clear) was just about launching the brand, I personally would rather attempt launching through our own shopify site, rather than use FBA. I\u2019ve spoken with a handful of individuals who are running successful FBA businesses and there advice was that for the product we have, who we are targeting, and the impact on our margins FBA wouldn\u2019t be worth it. \n\nI am leaning towards a launch strategy utilizing FB ads, utilizing the research we have already gained about our target market ( but keeping it general enough for the FB ads to gather new insights / specifics as to who is most likely to convert) as well as testing different ad copy\u2019s \n\nI feel that attempting an organic growers strategy is very time consuming and I am not an expert on content creation (I have experience, especially with the luxury watch trading startup) but not for a home products brand",

Fast forward a few months, and the product is looking a lot better and is in full operation.\r\n\nQuick Introduction: Zenith Calendar, a fully customizable online time-management and scheduling calendar to reduce your scheduling time to zero. Scheduling meetings across multiple calendars, sharing your calendar link with other clients and personalizing your profile for your needs, all available with Zenith.\r\n\nFeedback Requested: I would love to hear your through and feedback on the use case of the product, as well as the features available in the free, pro and plus subscription models.\r\n\nAdditional Comments: I\u2019m happy to offer you all the 100% discount for our Pro Plan. Simply use the Code: FREEPRO at checkout, and you will be able to get access to the monthly subscription of the Pro version free of charge.\r\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you more!",

By creating your brainstorming session, Brainstormer automatically creates a unique link for your session, that you can share with your students to attend and participate in the brainstorming session. Additionally, once the session is over, you can all vote on the best ideas written in the session and rank them in order.\r\n\nFeedback Requested: After spending 2 years on developing the product and the overall user experience, I would love to hear the opinion of the customers, their thoughts, feedback, improvements suggestions as well as the opinion on the current features available.\r\n\nDiscount for interested customers: Of course! I'm a firm believer that the product speaks for itself, so I'm ready to offer you all a free trial access to the facilitator subscription, so feel free to create your account and access the free trial through this link: [https://www.brainstormer.online/free-trial](https://www.brainstormer.online/free-trial)\r\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you all!",

We do have video tutorials available in the footer of the website, but IMO, it is very easy to use and understand. Just create your account, start your brainstorming session, and share your unique link to your participants.\n\nYes, the voting feature is something we implemented mainly to help our customers once the brainstorming session is complete. The goal is to find ideas and make decisions after each brainstorming session, and the voting part helps a lot with that.\n\nI would love to further assist you with your understanding of our product, so feel free to ask me anything, I would love to help",

I would not want to use a separate software dedicated for e receipts and certainly not pay for it. Main concern is that it's just not a concern for me. \n\nThough I think for businesses this might be more useful? Since they might want to keep track of all their receipts for bookkeeping/tax purposes.",

Not even VCs get non-dilutive equity (at most they get pro-rata which gives them the right, but not obligation, to retain their stake by investing more capital), and they\u2019re already investing capital.

This person/firm is bad news, there are plenty of other ways to get what you need. \n\nMy opinion, shared by many in the startup community, is you don\u2019t need consultants in the first place.

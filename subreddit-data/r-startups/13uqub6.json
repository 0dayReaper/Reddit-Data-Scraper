    "postText": "I have built a prototype for a toy product that contains a custom PCB (now in final form) and some peripherals (motor, speaker, buttons, sensors, etc.) inside a 6\"x3\"x2\" plastic housing. With initial user testing, the response has been very positive. I would appreciate any advice as to what are the next steps and sequence to get from such a prototype to market? I am located in Texas. My preliminary list is below:\n\n* File provisional patent (12 mo validity).\n* Build website (shopify?).\n* Shoot product pictures and videos, upload to website.\n* Perform extensive user testing and direct users to the website.\n* Identify a manufacturer (in China?) and determine the cost for parts and pcb. (Need to visit China? Other alternative countries to manufacture?)\n* Create crisp 60-second video ad (~$3000?) and post on website and social media.\n* Hire social media influencers? (Fixed period profit sharing deal?)\n* Open the website to the public for preorders.\n* Schedule a social fundraising campaign (indigogo, kickstarter, etc) offering preorders. (Would it clash with preorders on my website?)\n* If sufficient preorders are received, place an order with the manufacturer.\n* Order small batch for final testing and early sales.\n* Order larger quantities.\n\nMy budget is $20,000. However, I prefer to rely on the pre-orders to gauge the viability of the business as well as source the initial batch of production. Will greatly appreciate your feedback.",

            "comment": "Toys are a very crowded space and also still  have a big retail/  distribution\nComponent. Plenty of contract manufacturers in China but my guess is 100k-300k min for tooling and custom pcb run.  I spent$15k just for design and lead piece on a small 2\"x4\" pcb that had Bluetooth and battery, and we wrote the firmware. \n\nUnique to toys companies are always looking for good ideas.  For the patent then approach  toy makers for licensing deals.  They do all the manufacturing and you get a few percent per sale.  Win win. \n\nToys are also a hardware sale business so most vcs won't touch them without some type of tech play/ differentiation. But frankly few hits in the toy space I wouldn't pitch vcs",

Currently, I'm testing my product with users. The response to date has been very positive. Let's say I make a very slick ad and website. Best case scenario may be that I attract a lot of preorders and signups (e.g. $100,000+). I would still need to order PCBs and spend on the tooling. The PCB and toy hardware are already designed. I'm trying to see what you mean by 'sell first build later' in this context? Do you mean 3d print the parts, order small batches of pcb, and assemble at home? Thanks.",

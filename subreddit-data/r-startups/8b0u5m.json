    "postText": "A Ukrainian emigrant, Jan Koum incorporated WhatsApp Inc. on his birthday, February 24th, 2009. Working out at gym he kept missing phone calls due to the rule barring cellphones. Being a programmer he came up with the idea of a mobile address book with statuses next to contact names, so that friends could let one another know if they were available or at the gym, in a meeting etc. It took several weeks to create the working app. To get first users he reached the Russian emigrants community in San Jose through his friend Alex Fishman. That community become WhatsApp early adopters.\n\nThough, that time WhatsApp was a really muggy mess and had a dramatically low traction. Koum was about to giving up and just drop out... and than the miracle of \"Timing\" factor occurred. Apple launched push notifications, which Koum seized by WhatsApp. In the newest incarnation, when users changed their statuses the app pinged everyone in their network via push notification. Users liked this feature so much that the Retention metric soared as a unicorn on rainbow. And out of the blue Koum realized he had accidentally created a mobile instant messenger. Leveraging the opportunity, Koum released WhatsApp 2.0 with a more messaging functionality, and the traction brought over 250k users. That combination of the internal events, internal luck, and the swift adaptation proved both hypothesis (value and growth) for that WhatsApp's MVP after the pivot.\n\n\"No Ads! No Games! No Gimmicks\" - became a famous growth hack WhatsApp utilized to leverage their growth since. WhatsApp was not the only apps developer who took the opportunity of Apple's push notification. By January 2011, it had more than a dozen direct competitors, albeit - all of them were supported by advertising. To stand out of the crowd, Koun decided to ignore the conventional rules - neither to run ads inside WhatsApp, nor to spend anything on advertising or paid UA (user acquisition).\n\nAnd the company's third early growth hack was, definitely, based on pricing - providing better and cheaper alternative to traditional limited and expensive SMS/MMS. In fact, WhatsApp offered valuable, sought-after features above and beyond what mobile carriers were providing, including group chat, audio and video file sharing, and location sharing for free in the first year and just $0.99 each year thereafter. Indeed, Blackberry\u2019s BBM and Apple\u2019s iMessage offered their own \"free SMS\" alternatives, thought they didn\u2019t work across platforms. That the weakness WhatsApp seized to push them off the market and finally become the benchmark of the messengers since.\n\nMy growth hacking posts \"How XXX got their first users\":\n\n[How WhatsApp Got Their First Users](http://benchhacks.com/growthstudies/whatsapp-growth-hacks.htm)\n\n[How Airbnb Got Their First Users](http://benchhacks.com/growthstudies/airbnb-growth-hacks.htm)\n\n[How Dropbox Got Their First Users](http://benchhacks.com/growthstudies/dropbox-growth-hacks.htm)\n\n[How Etsy Got Their First Users](http://benchhacks.com/growthstudies/etsy-growth-hacks.htm)\n\n[How Facebook Got Their First Users](http://benchhacks.com/growthstudies/tinder-growth-hacks.htm)",

IMs were there to replace text but never marketed like that. I am not saying others failed, I am saying others didn't even try. Others stuck with their add/remove friends via usernames. WhatsApp made your number as username, thats it. This way all your contacts with WhatsApp activated became your friends as those usernames(numbers) were already registered and added to your address book(contacts). Now you see the similarity as I am trying to portray?\n\nWhatsApp used mobile numbers as user indentifiers instead of usernames as IMs do. IMs were already there to replace text messaging, they never integrated phone numbers in their platform as an alternate identifier.  Look at Telegram, they have usernames as well as phone numbers as identifiers. ",

Koum\u2019s Russian friend Alex Fishman held pizza and movie nights for that community at his West San Jose home. On such nights, Koum pitched for hours about his app idea to Fishman and tens of other Russian emigrants. The core of the app\u2019s earliest adopters came from this group. Alex supported the initial development as he could.\n\nIn October of 2009, Brian Acton, another Koum\u2019s friend and former fellow Yahoo employee, rounded up $250,000 in seed funding for WhatsApp, earning him the title of co-founder along with a substantial stake in the company. \n\nAs the app continued to gain traction, Acton and Koum were organically overwhelmed by attention from interested VCs, yet the pair was initially resistant. First and foremost, Koum and Acton were keen to deliver powerful, ad-free communication, and they felt accepting venture capital might force them to compromise. Nevertheless, Jim Goetz of Sequoia Capital refused to give up, working for months to arrange a meeting with either Koum or Acton.  Eventually, in April 2011, after Goetz promised to keep WhatsApp ad-free, the founders accepted $8M in venture capital from Sequoia. \n\nBy November 2011, WhatsApp had become the No. 1 paid social app for iOS, and had been downloaded 10 million times on Android. \n\nWhatsApp went on to raise another $50M from Sequoia in July of 2013.\n\nLater on, in February of 2014 the company was acquired by Facebook for $19B, the largest to date for a venture-backed company.",

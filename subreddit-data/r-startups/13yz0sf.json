I personally experienced in my life that I have been exploring pursuing as a passion project that would ultimately lead to a start up, but I for the life of me cannot figure out which one I like more and I don\u2019t have enough lifetimes to do it all.",

Start by identifying the assumptions behind each business model (e.g., \u201emy customer has this pain point and is willing to pay for a solution\u201c), and call 5 people to ask if they really have that problem. I bet you\u2019ll find that not all of your ideas are actually realistic solutions to actual problems. It might take you a while to test stuff, but the effort means you won\u2019t waste time building something no-one wants.",

When u look at them which one feels like your 100% motivated and excited to spend your life on. Your theme or concept around it (is it simple or complexed?), the amount of money you\u2019ll spend. For me, I did every idea but I always came back to books. So sometimes you\u2019ll try multiple ideas and the one you keep dreaming, thinking and feeling happy about will be your success.",

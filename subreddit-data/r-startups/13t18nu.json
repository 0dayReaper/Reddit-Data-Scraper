I\u2019ve only ever held developer roles and I\u2019ve built our product entirely alone for years (with a few pivots). \n\nI suspect my role is going to start to change as we scale and I\u2019d like to be prepared for it. What books can you recommend to help a low level developer grow into becoming a great CTO?\n\nHard and soft skills: how to build, lead, and grow a tech team, maintain a secure and predictable product, and communicate and manage risk, responsibility, and expectations. \n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot to learn out there, I\u2019d really appreciate it if you could help share some books that prepared you for your role, or that you wish you read sooner.",

It's really nice having someone you can meet with say once a month for an hour to get feedback or advice from. Surround yourself with people who have been there done that. I am non-tech, but my co-founder is, so I got us an advisor to mentor him who was a CTO in many companies both early and late.",

And \"The Innovator's Dilemma\" by Clayton Christensen, this book explores why successful companies fail and provides insights on how to avoid that fate by focusing on disruptive innovation. These two are pretty good to read. Good luck!",

One of the things that doesn\u2019t always get talked about are the politics and dealing with other departments. \n\nIn my experience this can be challenging and frankly can be the worst part depending on who you work with and the culture of your company. Even a small 10-15 person company can be destroyed by one or two people.\n\nI don\u2019t have a book to recommend but this article is pretty interesting and actually is eerily similar to some of my own experiences: https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/ill-never-be-a-chief-technology-officer-again-unless-it-s-for-my-own-company-bbf2b767726a\n\nIt can still be fun and worth the journey but just keep your eyes open.",

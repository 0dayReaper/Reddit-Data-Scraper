    "postText": "Hi folks, I joined Uber straight out of college, almost 3 years ago. Ever since I have worked as a frontend engineer where my work mostly consisted of creating react components/ importing Baseweb components and formatting the same to make the feature work. \nI changed teams some time ago, in my previous team, I did used to work 10+ hours a day but thats not the case in my current team.\nI feel like I have reached a saturation point in learning frontend from work, and I am now trying to learn it from scratch given the gaps in my knowledge due to only working on feature enhancements since i joined.\nI would definitely want to get better frontend work where my skillset could improve and would also like the flexibility to work remotely, hence I am leaning towards preparing for FE interviews at startups that provide remote work.\nBut since uber was my first job and I am not that confident on my frontend skills, I feel confused whether joining a startup would be the right choice or not.\nAny advice on how can I prepare myself for interviewing and working at a startup/ any particular courses i should take up / or what kind of side projects should i make ?\nAlso, is 3-4 yoe too late to start working for startups?\nMy priority at the moment is remote work and opportunity to learn while working",

Approach like you're just a really smart person whose first job out of school is that startup. Be open-minded, and try to find ways to do as much as you expect you can with as little as possible.\n\nI've worked with/for several big companies (Lockheed, Caterpillar, Motional, TuSimple) and smaller companies/startups (In-Depth Engineering, IAM Robotics, Agot.ai, handful of stealth startups). Both settings have opportunities and perils requiring spins on the tactics you can learn from both settings.\n\nIn the end, remember that for you it's just another job. That might sound counter-startup coming from here, but look no further than your circumstances: You're joining a startup and not a founder. Equity until the business IPOs or gets bought out is meaningless/worthless. So your only real compensation is the paycheck and whatever other value you can pull from the experience (networking, lean-experiences, culture so small it can't afford drama [which can be good or bad depending on leadership], etc.). Do what's right for you, and no matter what GROW!",

I think after the certain point one has to actually get that experience and see for themselves if it works for them or not, if it does then thats great, else take it as a learning and cut the losses.\nI guess it makes sense to mentally prepare myself for the culture and try my best to deliver to my capacity. If nothing atleast i would end up with an experience. :)",

            "comment": "Three years is probably a perfect number. You have a good experience on how established products are developed. You can add a great value to any early stage startup with this experience. About your front end experience, I joined a startup as a full stack developer with just 1 year of experience in one of the top 10 software companies.\n\nI was lucky to have gotten the opportunity in the startup but I learned more on the job than I learned from any side project. Side projects can help, but working in a startup with real world problems and processes, really ups your skills and knowledge. So I would recommend not to dally. Go ahead and join a startup.\n\nHowever, early stage startups might be less likely to hire full time remote developers. Bangalore is a great place to find startups. If you are already in Bangalore, try finding one in the city. You might benefit from the 50% remote work option which is becoming quite common these days",

I think what is holding me back is that i dont feel confident in my frontend knowledge because I couldn\u2019t give it full attention to learn and build things from scratch. I think you are right. Making a few side projects would give me enough learning to atleast attempt working at a startup. \nAt the moment working from Bangalore is not feasible for me because i have to live in my hometown(delhi) for personal reasons. So i am considering startups that operate remotely/ delhi NCR",

If it doesn't, you are left with an immense experience in building products from scratch.\n\nIf your goal is just frontend learning, try picking up an idea that you think can make a difference. A simple (may be crazy?) idea, easy enough to build, possibly that benefits you or your friends. Maybe an instagram like website for cats, who knows. See if you can get a friend to work on the backend. This way you might have a full working product with you to show off rather than just the knowledge.\n\nOr you could try and create UI replicas of websites like instagram, twitter, or any other site or app you prefer.\n\nEither way, please understand that experienced frontend engineers are often asked in the interviews to show their portfolio of frontend work they have done. So having something to show will help you a lot.",

I think the lack of confidence I feel in my frontend knowledge is because i have never built anything from scratch. Thats why I signed up for the odin project because i wanted a more hands on tutorial since I lose interest very easily in theoretical ones!\nSo far i have been having fun and i listed down some web app ideas for my own projects too!\nThanks a lot for commenting! I feel very motivated now :)",

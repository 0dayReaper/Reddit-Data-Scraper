    "postText": "I want to share something that's been weighing on me. As an employee in a typical corporate role, I have a strong urge to break free from corporate life and dive into entrepreneurship.\n\nI appreciate the opportunities and challenges my job has given me, shaping me into a skilled professional. But deep down, I know there's more to life than climbing the corporate ladder and working on projects that don't align with my passions. I want to pursue something greater, a chance to be creative, take risks, and build something amazing. However, finding like-minded individuals who share my entrepreneurial aspirations is difficult. The corporate environment doesn't encourage such pursuits, making it quite frustrating.\n\nI want to connect with others who believe in groundbreaking ideas and can transform them into successful ventures. Together, we could challenge the status quo and make a lasting impact, but finding these collaborators feels like searching for a needle in a haystack.\n\nI am curious if any of you relate to this and have faced a similar issue, or if this is more of an isolated issue I am facing?",

They are very different.\n\nIf you want friends who are more business or entrepreneurially minded, that's great - but if the motive for making friends with them is to have them get you out of the rat race, that's not great.\n\nIf you want a cofounder, decide if you need a technical or non technical founder (whichever is the opposite of you) and start asking around - but don't do it under the guise of making friends. I have been used as that before, and it's not fun.",

A word of caution: sometimes the grass looks greener on the other side\n\nThe part I found stressful about being an entrepreneur was being responsible for payroll. This may not be it for you, but it was enough for me to not want to own a business with a bunch of employees. \n\nYou might want to challenge your assumptions (especially about cofounders) and explore other options. \n\nYou may enjoy being an intrapreneur where you get to use corporate dollars to build startups within an organization. \n\nYou may enjoy being a solopreneur. Some inspiring examples are Hassan Osman, aka Author on the Side and Justin Welsh who makes over a million a year with a one person business. Hassan spends 10 hours a week creating info products and Udemy courses. He\u2019s a corporate guy that brings in a healthy five figures a month passively through these projects. \n\nAs a corporate person you\u2019d have a ton of great experience that could help you in your entrepreneurial pursuits. These days with the internet there are more options than employee or founder. \n\nI\u2019ll spare you my monologue on how great cofounders are harder to find than a compatible spouse, and a breakup of a business can be messier than an ugly divorce.",

If you're in a large city, I am guessing there will be some level of community and events you could start attending to meet folks.\n\nYou can also travel if it means that much. Startup Weekend is a great event to give that entrepreneurial itch a scratch in a self contained event. You meet people, brain storm, work on something a little bit. It's unlikely to actually turn into anything after the weekend, but the process and experience could be something really helpful. It might also start connections, ideas, etc to help you move forward and decide if you really want to go that direction.\n\nBut if I were in your shoes, I'd be looking at coworking spaces, hackathons, and meetup to find events that fit what you're hoping to get into. With some luck, you'll find a room that fits.",

I have finally stopped proposing them to work together and understood this is not going to happen.\n\nI have met 20-30 co-founders though matching platforms, but there either everyone wants to build their own thing (not blaming them) or not willing to join you because they are looking for a big thing (and not my 'no-one-is-using-MVP'). Even if I find someone through these platforms, I will be doubtful that the relationship will sustain, as they are very new in friendship and as being a co-founder is like a marriage, the probability of this being successful will be very low.\n\nSo, moving alone so far.",

They\u2019re there to help brainstorm, keep you on a schedule, and help get something, anything, off the ground (ie prototypes, websites, pipeline).\n\n- Join YC Startup School. The co-founder match tool is great for meeting potential partners, ex founders, and future employees. I have a pipeline of five engineers, including two potential CTOs, from SUS.\n\n- Build a pipeline of customers. Find them at the bar, LinkedIn, Twitter, church, wherever. Talk to people and vet your idea. Get them interested before you start coding.\n\n- Build relationships with investors. Acknowledge that you might be early, but that you're laying the groundwork for a pre-seed or seed round. Get into their pipeline. \n\nIt gets a lot easier after you have a prototype. I literally just finished mine after about 5 months, and have a handful of investor meetings, co-founder interviews, and prospect reviews over the next few weeks. All second or third meetings. \n\nI also have a bunch of marketing opportunities and a conference invitation through all of the networking. \n\nMake your own luck. Get out there.",

It's not uncommon for individuals in corporate roles to experience the desire for something more, something beyond the confines of the corporate world. The longing to explore entrepreneurship, embrace creativity, and take risks is a powerful call that many of us feel.  \nWhile corporate life offers its own set of advantages and opportunities for growth, it's natural to yearn for a deeper alignment between our passions and our work. Breaking away from the traditional path and pursuing something greater can be both exciting and challenging.  \nYou're not alone in your quest to connect with like-minded individuals who share your entrepreneurial aspirations. It can indeed feel like searching for a needle in a haystack, as the corporate environment often discourages or overlooks these pursuits. However, know that there are communities and networks out there specifically designed to bring together individuals who are passionate about groundbreaking ideas and transforming them into successful ventures.  \nConsider exploring entrepreneurship-focused events, conferences, and online platforms. Engaging with these communities can help you find support, guidance, and potential collaborators who understand your drive and can contribute to making a lasting impact.  \nRemember, your desire for something more is valid, and there are others who have faced similar challenges. Keep searching, stay motivated, and surround yourself with people who share your vision. Together, you can break free from the corporate constraints and embark on a fulfilling entrepreneurial journey.",

I met a couple of really interesting potential cofounders who I might end up working with when I'm ready to roll on a business idea in a couple months, and YC also hosts events in major cities so you can meet potential cofounders in person. \n\nWhen you join the cofounder matching platform, I'd try to find someone with complementary skills. Ideally both of you are technical and able to build software/your core product yourself. You really shouldn't be thinking about hiring anyone in the early days, just find a really good cofounder and build the first version of the business in public as fast as possible to see if you start getting some traction.\n\nNote: I'm allergic to venture capital for the most part, and I still think what YC is doing is great. The advice they offer in the course applies whether or not you want to go after VC funding or through an accelerator program like YC at all.",

Be active with them on Twitter.\n\nI am and have been for a VERY long time in the same situation as you: I literally am 1. from a generation who thinks entrepreneurship is \"too risky\" and 2. don't have anyone around me irl that understands why I would ever want to work on my own thing when my 9-5 is so \"great\".\n\nFinding an ONLINE community of like minded individuals really is a game changer. It's great to talk with people or just read about their journeys and the same struggles they have as you.\n\nGood luck. You really are not alone.",

    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nWe are interviewing for CTO roles at the moment, and beyond technical capability, we're thinking about how well candidates might fit into a seed stage startup. One particular concern is around those who have only worked at larger companies before - while competent and experienced, I feel like they might be lacking the go-getter, all hands on deck creative problem solving element required for this role. A little too \"rigid.\"\n\nAnyone have any ideas for questions or tasks to solve for this? Past experience has led me to believe this quality is vital, so I'm keen to hear ideas.\n\nThanks v much!",

            "comment": "Look up the type 5 personality model, entrepreneurs are high in the personality traits \"conscientiousness\" and \"openness with experience\". So they need to be hard working and obsessed with efficiency. For the trait openness for experience you can check if they have hobbies that has to do with constant learning, like creative hobbies (music, painting or reading), traveling to new locations, or doing projects (open source or hackathons). Mentioning only sports is a red flag, because sports are kinda repetitive and that would bore quickly somebody more creative.",

With the trait \"conscientiousness\"you need to be careful, because it has two subtypes \"orderliness\" and \"industriousness\", they seem similar at beginning but they substantially differ. Orderly people are obsessed with order and industriousness people with efficiency. Order is not always good, makes a person follow processes even of they are inefficient, best example is burocracy. Big corp make the mistake of filling manager position with \"conscientiousness\" people, but they are high in the trait orderliness which makes the organization very inflexible.\n\nYou want the industriousness people, studies showed they are the backbone for the success of a company. Because in essence founding a startup is solving a inefficiency in a specific domain. Industriousness people are \"lazy\" they want the easy route, they like to automatize, they don't like burocracy, and are orderly only when it's more efficient to be so.",

But more like a \"we have this new functionality that we think can attract X customer segment for Y reson.  What do you do?\" \n\nIn a case like that you can grasp if the answer is fully loaded of bureaucracy, or is full of jargon, if he goes straight into the tech or thinks about the customer, etc.",

            "comment": "Good for you to consider factors above and beyond skills and technical ability. A CTOs success in the job often relies on much more that. How a person THINKS, how a person FEELS, and how a person WORKS are the three dimensions I always define. Metaphorically speaking, their HEAD, their HEART, and their HANDS \u2013 the 3Hs.\n\nHead:  ability to reason, think critically, common sense, problem solving\n\n*\"Walk me through, step by step, what your plan would be if...(state some technical problem/catastrophe)*\n\nHeart: emotional intelligence, empathy, inspiration, character, compassion, values &amp; beliefs\n\n*\"What kinds of things (including people) really aggravate, frustrate or piss you off?\"*\n\nHands: behaviour (which is the result of the preceding dimensions) and ability \n\nIt's good to have a technical assessment at the ready here, one that is similar to the tools/environment you're using. And always, always, always, conduct reference checks. You want to hear first hand how this person performed and what they contributed in their previous jobs \u2013 especially when shit hit the fan. \n\nAbout your comment around hiring someone from a larger company \u2013 it's a valid concern. Too often startups get all starry eyed when they see someone from a FAANG company or later stage startup. They mistakenly believe that they'll come to work on day one requiring zero ramp up time or training, and fit right in. Wrong. Larger, more mature startups (post seed, Series A+) tend to be structured, well oiled machines; with structure, playbooks, and culturally specific ways of doing things. Your company will be different. The people will be different. A plant will either grow and thrive or wither and die depending on the soil and the environment around them. \n\nOne last critical piece of advice: don't hire someone trying to get out a bad situation (especially in this economic environment). They're often just looking for a job, any job, a safe place to land. \n\nBe sure they fit your culture and your values above anything else.",

If they haven't managed teams and built and shipped real product, they aren't legitimate CTO candidates, IMHO. OTOH, If you are implying that the CTO won't work hard enough like all the other people in your company, I would suggest hiring them immediately so they can force you to work normal hours, take vacations, and avoid burnout.",

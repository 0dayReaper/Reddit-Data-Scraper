    "postText": "8 yrs have passed since I quit my corporate job to start a career in the startup world. In these 8 yrs, I have founded 3 startups and worked in 3. Some of the time I have spent doing miscellaneous projects.\n\nBut what a rewarding journey it has been. It's not that I have earned a lot of money or a lot of respect or recognition. I am still a pretty unknown and normal person. But the experience of all these years is something I cherish.\u00a0 The most important thing I have learned is that you have to solve problems and not get bogged down by them. The other is to stay positive in whatever situation you are in, things do improve.\n\nI have made a lot of friends at this time and experienced a lot of different challenges that aren't there in a 9-5 job. I have been bruised, hit hard, but appreciated also. Is there a discontent that I couldn't make it big and earn a name for myself? Would I have been happier if I had achieved \"externally\" a lot more? I don't know. But I don't feel unhappy at this time.\n\nI am not an expert in any field. More like a jack of all trades, but that is okay. I can learn more about each field as I go along. Also, I can hire specialists to do the job for me.\n\nIn the end, I will say It's been a hell of a ride. A lot of my beliefs have been shattered, a lot of new beliefs have been formed. And I try to keep an open mind.\u00a0\n\nEdit: Mods pls remove this if not relevant.",

I\u2019ve been wondering if I made the right decision to stick with the start up (only done a few days so far), but I think I have - the freedom and challenges and every day is different is really appealing.\n\nThey also seem happier to listen to ideas and to fail fast, and move on. Rather than in corporates who wanted \u201cinnovative\u201d ideas but smashed them down as soon as they come out of your mouth. Ultimately I don\u2019t want to work for corporate forever, and want to start my own consulting business one day, so I think this is the right choice.",

It is personally rewarding to know you are impacting a business and helping it propel towards success. Unfortunately due to the number of people where I work now, it is trivial when any accomplishments are made and often have a minor impact on the business itself.\n\nGreat to point that out at least OP. One unfortunate thing for me personally is I left the startup as I had completed my goals and they were becoming successful. Unfortunately for me, they went public 100 days after I left and I lost out on a large chunk of my shares (that are worth $200,000 if I stayed right now).",

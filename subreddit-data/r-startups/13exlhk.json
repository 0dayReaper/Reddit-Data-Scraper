I've been consulting in a niche legal space for over a decade. Probably have worked with approaching 50 clients in that time I'd guess. You get repeated exposure to challenges, pain points, opportunities etc. You also get to try various ideas and concepts out with real companies and see what works. So to the OP question, I think the best approach is deep knowledge of an industry as an insider.\n\nTo receptionSelect.... tell us more? What happened when you jumped ship? Did you get a profitable exit in any way? \n\nI'm developing a software product in my own time that I will  split with my consulting company employer.

I tend to have an easy time coming up with the ideas, but not enough time and focus to build any of them :)\n\nFOr instance, I am currently working on a European travel app. My 'problem' (and passion) is that I constantly dream about traveling to Europe. Plus I want to help others plan trips to Europe, so I'm building a tool that does this to scratch my own itch. I'm including interviews with other travelers so I can talk to and meet others who share my passion for European travel. Does this exist? Probably. Do I use other tools like this? No. So I don't care if it exists. There's enough room for multiple players and it's a labor of love that is monetizable and helpful to others.\n\nAnother project I've built and try to monetize is a cycling tracker that motivates your to go from riding zero miles to riding a century (100 miles) because I want to ride a century and I am out of shape and need a riding plan. Do these things exist? Yup. Do I care or use them? Nope. Not looking for millions, just a little side money from users who find my tracker simple enough to use and motivating enough to stick to.\n\nAnother project I'm building (on the back burner) is a Soccer Skills app: Videos of players demonstrating soccer skills that team coaches or local clubs can give to their players to track practice and improvement and allow teammates to compete with each other in skill reps and challenges and unlock new skills as the master simpler ones. What was my 'problem'? I was a coach of a youth team during COVID and wanted to continue to help my players improve so I built a beta version to allow them to log in and watch skills videos to practice and me to monitor their practice advancements.\n\nOthers include a scout advancement tracking app I want to use with my Cub Scout Pack to track their badge completions and advancements.And a Soccer Match Score predictor that allows users to follow multiple teams and leagues and predict scores to compete with each other for points and run up a leader board. Why because me and my friends played an old MVP i built and I think I could make a more robust version and monetize....except for trademark issues  :) \n\nI have so many more that I just don't have time to build: A reading list tracker and book suggestion tool, Fitness Challenge app, Family Social Media platform, Gift Wish List, Habit Former/Tracker, Honeymoon Gifting app, an Interview Q &amp; A builder &amp; tracker (built this for my Europe project to track the interviews I invite people to do), Family Meal Planner and Recipe Keeper, Startup MVP Duel, Startup Progress Tracker, Web Development Tutorials Courses platform, so many ideas so little time to build them.\n\nDo all these things exist? Yes. Does that mean I shouldn't make them? Nope. As I mentioned there is room in all markets for multiple competitors. Are all of these billion $$ ideas? No. But they don't need to be. I'm happy replacing my household income and living financially independent from the 9-5 BS.",

Because markets with cashflow risk are harder to succeed in, there are more opportunities there, so they seem like more obvious risks. But this is often a delusion.",

You can execute the shit out of a washable fabric toilet paper (pun intended), but it\u2019s not likely to get much traction, is it? Of course not, because the underlying idea is shit (I\u2019m so punny!). Here\u2019s another one: car interiors that are made out of fruit leather so you could eat them if you got trapped in your car for an extended period of time. Again, execute away on that pile of crap, old chum!\n\nExecution is limited by the potential of the idea. Think of it like rolling a ball. You can push it as hard as you can, but a 1,000kg stone ball isn\u2019t going uphill with you pushing it. The ball is the product/service, the hill is people\u2019s desire for it. On the other hand, release that boulder at the top of the road between Concocha and Paramonga (72 mile stretch descending almost 13,400 ft) and it\u2019s going to be a fucking long time before it runs out of steam. You can be the strongest guy on earth (the best at executing business ideas), but you\u2019re not pushing a 1,000kg or 10,000kg ball uphill. The ability to execute is, to a significant extent, *dependent* on the idea. You can execute the hell out of a shit idea and end up with a huge pile of shit (execution - idea = huge pile of shit), you can have the best idea and do nothing with it and end up with nothing (idea - execution = nothing), or you can couple someone with a fantastic idea with someone who can execute the hell out of it and end up with both people being ridiculously rich (idea + execution = ding ding ding ding ding, you\u2019re a winner!). As a side note, executing on a shit idea can be worse than not executing on a fantastic idea, because with the latter you just end up with nothing, but the former could leave you destitute.\n\nWhenever someone says something like \u201cI\u2019ve had 1000s of business ideas in my life\u201d I always think that they\u2019re either full of it, that their ideas are utterly shit, or that they\u2019re more dreams than ideas (eg. here\u2019s an idea: being able to teleport anywhere on earth).\n\nI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d wanna share some of your ideas that you\u2019ve either executed or dismissed?",

Namely: I was sick of not being able to do things easily or conveniently on Windows PCs, so started an app that uses hotkeys and text triggers to automate things, such as typing for me and arranging my entire PC setup with each boot by saving and restoring PC states.\n\nThen I started solving further inconveniences like being able to lock my PC but still see what it's doing, or for an action to occur when a window closes (such as shutting down your PC when a long process ends and the app for it doesn't have a feature to shut down on completion). And so on for many other Windows inconveniences.\n\nYes, AutoHotkey exists but that's a full-blown programming language, and I wanted to keep things simple and in one single exe (instead of multiple exes like AHK creates). Also, by not generating custom exes like AHK, it doesn't get flagged by anti-virus apps when you create automated actions (because our app's exe is clean).",

The bold text in the paragraphs of the blog articles is making my eyes uncomfortable for some reason. The text you have in the page for [Pitch](https://www.theventurecanyon.com/p/pitch) isn't bold and is much nicer to read.\n\nCool idea, have subscribed, will shoot you back an email as I'd love to add my startup there!  \n\n\n\\*Edit - after reading the first email, love your copy.   \nI like the name even more now with the little sunset + cactus graphic in the subject (nice touch!).   \nThe main logo is appearing really small in comparison to the frame you have on my email.  \nAlso the canyon icon is so good, should add it to your landing page",

With a light blue screen featuring yellow font, our eyes were often exhausted after eight hours of work.\n\nSince then, our biggest dream was to solve that issue on scale for everybody, resulting in faster, cheaper paper to data conversion and so we created BillSnap.\n\nOur software uses cutting-edge AI to completely transform the way businesses process invoices. Just snap a photo of the invoice, and within moments, you have a JSON or Excel file ready.\n\nwww.bill-snap.com\n\n**More Details**\n\nWhy is BillSnap unique?  \n1. Flexibility: Choose any output format you prefer. Plus, you get to select which parts of the invoice are important to you. Whether you want to detail a hotel bill per night or provide a full invoice, it's entirely up to you.  \n2. Accuracy: BillSnap uses sophisticated Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and advanced AI (Large Language Models) to ensure precise results.  \n3. Efficiency: No more endless hours of manual data entry. With BillSnap, you can digitize invoices in mere seconds instead of minutes!  \n4. Ease of use: Simply take a photo of the invoice, and BillSnap takes care of the rest.  \nWhether you're a small business owner looking to reduce administrative work, or a large enterprise striving to go paperless, BillSnap is designed to simplify your life.  \nBook a demo now at  [https://calendly.com/billsnapemail/30min?month=2023-06](https://calendly.com/billsnapemail/30min?month=2023-06) or visit us at [www.bill-snap.com](https://www.bill-snap.com)\n\n**Your role?**\r  \n\r  \nI'm Chris, co-founder of BillSnap.\r  \n\r  \n**What goals are you trying to reach this month?**\r  \n\r  \nFor now, we're interested in businesses with a daily invoice volume of at least 50.  \nWe are trying to reach one business that is interested in our service.\r  \n\r  \n**How could** r/startups **help?**\r  \n\r  \nFeedback is the key to improvement.

So what happened was our communication was scattered and caused a lot of problems for us. Apart from that when working with emails, starting from the interface to not being collaborative, fundamentally it just didn\u2019t work for our startup. So we decided to build Zapmail; which is a collaborative communication tool that resembles popular instant messaging platforms while providing the added functionality of global email communication.   \n   \n\nWith dedicated channels, streamlined email management, and integrations with existing systems, Zapmail empowers your business to create a connected and productive work environment.By using Zapmail, you can streamline your team's communication processes and eliminate the need for multiple email clients.     \n\n\ud83d\udc49You can checkout this video for more details: [https://youtu.be/YiYTUcUHvdU](https://youtu.be/YiYTUcUHvdU)\n\n**More details:**    \n\n**What you get with Zapmail:**  \n\\* Custom domain emails  \n\\* Custom channels (groups)  \n\\* Cloud storage  \n\\* Fully cloud based  \n\\* Conversational emails.   \n\nValue additions:  \n\\* Custom 3rd party integrations  \n\\* AI email writer (Beta)  \n\\* Custom AI assistants (Beta): Based on your company needs, we also create in-built AI   \nassistants to automate tasks and replies, for example an AI assistant that can guide and   \nanswer inquiries based on the company knowledge base.  \n\\* In-app customer support  \n\\* Domain records setup support  \nOur startup is at validation stage, with a few businesses signed up and using us. We have also started talking to educational institutes as we see potential in that market as well, in terms of being a collaborative communication tool with inbuilt AI assisted learning channels.    \n\n**Your role**: I am Shay, co-founder of Zapmail    \n\n**What goals are you trying to reach this month?**  \nOur main goal is to get first users so that we can get feedback and make the product experience better. We would greatly appreciate you signing up your startup with Zapmail, because our product is positioned for young companies as such. Even referrals to other businesses/institutes and upvotes will be great!    \n\n**Discount for**\u00a0r/startups\u00a0**subscribers?**\n\nWe have a limited time offer for unlimited custom domain email accounts and channels free of charge.",

Know about these shipping issues before your customers complain by specifying your delivery time and letting the tool alert you when shipments are late. And automate customer emails based on shipping status to reduce support tickets. Have the functionality of ParcelPanel or aftership at a fraction of the price (or free for 100 shipments/month)\n\n\nProblem:\n\n- The carrier never scans a package or loses before it hits the distribution center. Or it gets lost in a distribution center.\n\n- The package gets stuck in an endless loop, has some delivery exception, is undeliverable, etc.\n\n- An employee prints the shipping label but the package never leaves the warehouse. Or a dropship vendor prints the label early to meet the SLA but doesn\u2019t actually ship.\n\n- Lots of WISMO (where is my order) customer service tickets.\n\nSolution:\n\n- Set your target delivery time and get alerts (SMS or email) when orders miss the target. \n\n- View all shipment statuses from all selling channels on one page with filters and sorting.\n\n- Let ShipAware decide whether you should contact the customer about the delay, or reship and file a missing mail claim.\n\n- Reduce or eliminate WISMO tickets through automated customer email notifications based on shipment status (ex: Automatic email when a customer's package is available for pickup at their post office or UPS access point, when it's delivered, when it ships, etc.)\n \n**Goals**:\n\nBetter UI/UX, more users\n\n\nMy role:\n\nFounder/developer\n\n\n**How could /r/startups help?**:\n\nWhat features/integrations are most important to you?

Here goes at the criteria:\n\n**Startup Name / URL:** RARP-ID Fitness - [www.rarp-idfitness.uk](https://www.rarp-idfitness.uk)\n\n  \n**Location of Your Headquarters:** London, United Kingdom\n\n  \n**Elevator Pitch/Explainer Video:** It all began for Richard during the pandemic when lockdown measures left him, like many others, searching for ways to stay active at home. Inspired to improve his fitness, he began working out with resistance bands. Unfortunately, his newfound passion led to an injury.  \nAs an engineer with a lifelong curiosity for understanding how things work, Richard couldn't let this setback deter him. He noticed his home stepper could perfectly complement his resistance band workouts, but it needed something extra. With determination and ingenuity, he experimented with various attachments and designs until he created an innovative feature compatible with a wide range of steppers.  \nThe RARP-ID Platform and Step accessory was born. Designed as either a direct replacement or supplementary addition to existing steppers or height adjusters, it expands the range of possible exercises while maintaining constant tension on the band for maximum effect. The ingenious accessory offers adjustable resistance and multiple positions for a comfortable workout.  \nRichard's invention minimises the risk of injuries caused by improper band positioning and prevents bands from slipping and striking the user. Confident in the RARP-ID stepper accessory, he believes it offers home fitness enthusiasts a safe, cost-effective solution.\n\nRichard's two passions\u2014his fascination with understanding how things are built and his commitment to maintaining an active lifestyle\u2014converged in a serendipitous moment three years ago. Combining resistance bands and an aerobic stepper sparked his imagination, but a busy schedule forced him to shelve the idea. The pandemic in 2019-20 finally offered him the time to bring his vision to life, culminating in creating these versatile accessories.  \nToday, Richard Alan Robert Peach is proud to share the RARP-ID stepper accessory, transforming his personal experience into a product that helps others prevent injuries, enhance their fitness, and make the most of their stepper workouts.\n\n  \n**More details:** We are currently trialing our prototypes with Personal Trainers and had amazing positive feedback so far. We are trying to build our audience via social media and exihbition visits, ready for Crowdfundin in September.  \nAs the founder and a personal user of our platform and band kit, I can honestly say I am learning every day of its increasing potential.\n\n  \n**What goals are you trying to reach this month?:** Acquire first sellers, build a community of potential interested buyers.\n\n  \n**How could** r/startups **help?:** Looking for honest feedback, positive or negative.  \n**Discount for** r/startups **subscribers?:** If you sign up to our newsletter, you are guaranteed first notification of our Crowdfunding a therefore product release.

We're building a tool just for you!\n\nWowzers.io is the idea, goal and project management solution built for bootstrapping. We provide the structure and tools you need to make informed decisions and manage your startup during turbulent times, even when customers and data are thin on the ground.\n\nUnlike similar offerings, Wowzers caters for the unique needs of startup/growth-phase businesses, not mature corporates. This means a focus on impact over output, and prioritisation over productivity. Because the first rule of bootstrapping is not wasting time and $$$ on activities that don't move the needle. (We're pretty hot on the 'productivity' stuff too once you identified your 'growth hacks'). Here's what sets Wowzers apart:\n\n\\#1 Prioritisation: Stop busying yourself doing low-impact work. Wowzers helps you identify and prioritise the activities that can drive growth.\n\n\\#2 Experimentation: Learn what works for your business. With Wowzers, you can run experiments and manage projects with ease.\n\n\\#3 Coordination: Manage everything and everyone. Even dev and marketing! And best of all, Wowzers supports cross-functional teams.\n\nWowzers wasn't built as a project management or team coordination tool but as Growth OS.

The idea came from when i worked at an investing bank and could see the huge interest in stocks from the common people...

On the other hand; analysts lacking a platform to reach an audience and make money \u2013 gave birth to OnlyFin.\n\nA website where analysts can present their analysis with visual tools and graphs. And investors can find the perfect analysts for them. For the service analyst can set a monthly subscription price.\n\nps the name is kind of a shock-value attempt to get some attention. I realize that it might scare some people off but I'm trying it out for the moment :)\n\n  \n**What goals are you trying to reach this month?**  \nI would **LOVE** to get a handful of people to try it out and even interview.

I started MeetMoji to solve a problem I saw first hand trying to deliver engaging all-hands, webinars, and sales calls.  We all realize there are lots of  issues with presenting and engaging in existing meeting platforms, but the last thing we need is another meeting platform.  So instead I decided to create a new way to present and engage better on any meeting platform.   \nMeetMoji provides a simpler way to prepare for your meeting, easier way to present during your meeting, and a way to engage everyone consistently no matter what meeting platform you used or where your audience attendeds from.  \nWith MeetMoji you create a MeetUp.  Your MeetUp is the place where you merge together all the slides, videos, live demos, poll, q&amp;a, etc through a simple web app.  When you are ready to start your meeting, launch your MeetUp (like clicking present on PPT), share your MeetUp instead of your screen, and then we make transitioning between content and applications as simple clicking next.  Engagement options are contained in the MeetUp so we can handle Q&amp;A, Polls, WordClouds, Emojis, Open Feedback, and it all works consistently on any meeting platform and with all audience types.  \n\nWe are in beta now and would love feedback, ideas and people to try it out in meetings you have. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM3yXeM0ba0\n\n**More details:**\n\n**What life cycle stage is your startup at?:** Validation  \n**Your role?:** Founder  \n**What goals are you trying to reach this month?:** 200 beta users  \n**How could** r/startups **help?:** Feedback, ideas, and using it in meetings   \n**Discount for** r/startups **subscribers?:**  Free for now and discount for anyone who signs up during the beta period when once we start charging",

We aim to ensure that the features and user experience align with the needs and expectations of travelers.\n\nHow could r/startups help? We would greatly appreciate the support and input of the r/startups community in shaping the future of Iter. Specifically, we are seeking feedback on the user experience, feature evaluation, authentication and security, and any general suggestions to enhance the overall product. Your insights will be invaluable in refining the travel planner and making it more customer-centric.\n\nDiscount for r/startups subscribers? As a token of appreciation for the r/startups community, we would like to offer a 50% discount on any future premium subscription plans for r/startups subscribers. This discount will be available once we launch our full product.\n\nWe are focusing on gathering feedback and validation at this stage.\n\nThank you for your support and participation in helping us shape the future of travel planning with Iter!\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nNote: This project was originally developed as my thesis final year project for my software engineering degree. Now, I am eager to take it to the next level and build a startup around it.\n\nI want to highlight that during the development of this prototype, I faced certain limitations and challenges that influenced its performance. Specifically, I was not allowed to utilize any third-party cloud services or incorporate the Google Maps API. These restrictions were in place to encourage us to develop our own recommender system and itinerary generator module from scratch, which would enable us to truly demonstrate our design and implementation skills.\n\nAs a result, the current prototype may have some performance limitations and could be slower compared to products that leverage existing cloud services and APIs. However, this allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms and technologies, and I believe it presents an exciting opportunity to create a travel planner that is independent and fully customized to the needs of its users.\n\nI apologize for any inconvenience caused by the slower performance. Your feedback and insights will be particularly valuable in helping me identify areas where optimization and improvements can be made.\n\nThank you for your understanding and support in evaluating this prototype under the given constraints. Your feedback will contribute significantly to refining the performance and overall experience of the travel planner.\n\nLooking forward to your valuable input and suggestions!",

It took me some time to understand that. This is a starting burger business located in Rio, which is growing very quickly and is proving itself to be very successful. \nThe revenue increased more than 4x since 2016 and is still growing. It aims to open 100 stores in Rio + S\u00e3o Paulo. \nBy their data, they have a profitable margin that ranges from 15 to 20% with returns after the first 12 mo average. All the current franchises from them are doing well.\nThe owner lives next to me, and we're talking a lot. I and a partner have enough capital for the acquisition and open a new store in Flamengo, a very rich/bohemian/popular neighborhood in Rio. Also, we're building an extremely capable and experienced team to work and manage the restaurant with us, and themselves will be partners of the business. Our aim is to open several franchises, and this will be our first shot. 50% of the profit will be reinvested for asset expansion, and 50% paid as dividends after we have in cash 12x the monthly costs of each restaurant.\nAs investors, we want you to make part of the business, analyze curriculum, and take decisions as well.\nOur plan is to build an investor club starting with this single franchise. Having several brains and investors on the business will increase exponentially the chances of success and diminish the risks.\nWe don't want tremendously big investors, but regular people who are focused and determined looking for new opportunities.\nIn the beginning, we are not planning to have a club greater than 50 people, and a total investment of U$160k.\n\nMy role: I'll be administrating the franchise as owner, investing my capital as well and also manage the investment club. I have experience with a small cake business in the past, and currently, I work as an engineer in pipelaying vessel, which I'm responsible for managing the marine engineering, operation, finance and bureaucracy of this department.\n\nThe goal: Always looking forward. The focus is on the club and acquisition of several new franchises.\n\nIF YOU WANT TO MAKE PART OF THIS, SEND ME A DM AND LET'S KNOW EACH OTHER.\nIF YOU'RE JUST A CURIOUS TRAVELLER WITHOUT A SINGLE PENNY IN THE POCKET, PLS, DON'T FLOOD :)",

Features such as semantic search, text summarization, data (in spreadsheets) summarization, generative question and answering, auto text suggestion, and data extraction (from a bodies of text), can now be built into your product in less than 30 lines of code. The best part? Our APIs are extremely versatile, meaning it can integrate with any existing codebase. Startups come to us looking to boost their ROIs by saving dev time and dev cost, and essentially gain an unfair advantage over their competitors by offering AI in their products without having to think twice. If that's you, we might be a good fit!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Some additional information for more technical folks out there** \n\nOur APIs are powered by 1) our own in house langchain (called BlitzChain) that is better, faster and cheaper, and 2) hosted vector databases as a layer on top of your primary datasource (eg a traditional SQL or NoSQL database).

But I really need to complete my data input for cities and attractions with costs and such so I can continue building and promoting the Travel Itineraries for the site.\n\nI think once I have uploaded the Itineraries I have (with the cost and average visit times for cities and attractions in each itienrary) AND publish more Interviews AND clean up and publish the remaining blog posts AND publish my podcast episodes, then the traffic and usefullness to users will be clearer, but there is so much to do between my other responsibilities with work and family and life.\n\nBut I chip away at what I can each day. Although I DID hope to have had the site done this year before the summer travel season...\n\nEDIT: Once I have more Itineraries, I will probably hide some of the pages and navigation and soft launch the interviews and itineraries on Product Hunt, then 'launch' an update when the other features I have planned are completed.",

Ppl are much more willing to root for you if you seem like a peer working with them to solve a shared problem, not an outsider trying to sell them things.

This involves listening to the feedback I get from users and updating the product so it improves over time and referral incentives.   \nOutside of this, I use my personal brand, Mind, Brain, Body Lab which has over 500k followers who all fall within our target customer profile to promote the products and services I create. This strategy includes Influencer &amp; Content Marketing, Paid Ads, Press Releases, App Store Optimization/SEO, &amp; direct outreach to target customers.   \n\n\nAll of that being said, it's still hard as you know what to get to 1k users, even more so for buyers. Some more of my free offerings have done it in 90 days, like my blog, or a free mental health assessment, and some of my paid things like coaching, a community &amp; a personalized advice video still haven't hit 1k users yet, although they do generate a decent amount of revenue, like $5k MRR, even under 1k users after 6 months.  \n\n\nI'm about to release a PWYC app in this space as well, so I will be more on this specific journey with you as well. I'm A/B testing landing pages to build a waitlist for it right away to start testing what copy/problems get the most clicks and sign ups, and then will have email campaigns going towards that list to help us get more data on the users and the problems they have.",

There's already a proven market for this app as there are many available on the app store and a few bigger players doing it well. We have studied the market and made our own version of seeing what's missing and what users are asking for that not being built and also adding our own features we believe will change the industry. So in terms of having a great product im confident in that aspect. I guess will just have to see how well we can market it. This is my first startup so there's a lot of things I will need to keep learning and implementing as we progress",

            "comment": "Chiming in on B2Bs. Here, I believe you have to have some sense of your target to get things going (successfully) early on. SMB vs Enterprise? Industry? Internal buyer - biz owner, C-suite, HR, ops group, etc. In addition, you should have some understanding of purchasing dynamics. For example, in enterprise, you may need to go through procurement or something. Versus in SMB you may need to start with some other gatekeeper specific to that business. You\u2019ll also need a sense of an acceptable price (based on the market) and contract structure. Early on, the challenge is to make good educated guesses about these things\u2026bc product market fit hasn\u2019t been solved yet. As a final thought, B2B traction metrics are a bit different and really depends on ACV / sales cycle variables. For some startups, 3 customers in first three years might be great\u2026because total ARR exceeds $1M. For others, 100 SMBs with no margin might be great because it opens doors to better distribution channels. Ultimately, I don\u2019t believe there is a magic bullet for making things an easier\u2026the cadence of hitting traction goals really depends on many factors. If you have an inside track within the market(s) you serve, pre-sales lined up, etc. that is likely the only way to really mitigate some of the grind",

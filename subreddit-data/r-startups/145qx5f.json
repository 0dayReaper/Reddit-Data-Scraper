    "postText": "I recently had something offered that I hadn't before. A startup worth an 8 figure amount has reached out to me offering me to be a ambassador of the company. In exchange, they will be offering me free equity in the company. At first I thought this was a scam, but then I checked and it is the CEO himself reaching out on LinkedIn. Interestingly, I had written some comments that were tough on the company, but not out of envy or hatred, just genuinely questioning what the direction of the company was, and the CEO had also mentioned these comments. What does it typically mean to be a ambassador, and should I take it?",

            "comment": "Brand ambassador is a public face of the company. It means you'll be expected to stay on message and be positive. You'll be expected to promote their products or services and present their point of view. \n\nFrom time to time you'll be asked to proactively post with messages they will determine to support their marketing. They might put you in their own marketing, which could include providing quotes or interviews to journalists.\n\nBefore you agree, make sure they're aligned with your personal values. Find out what commitment they want from you, the level of creative control you'll have and the parameters of your engagement. For example, will they cover any legal costs you face if they give you content to share about a competitor that results in you being sued for defamation / libel etc.\n\nYou may also want to check local laws on advertising and marketing, as brand ambassador content is considered an advert in many jurisdictions and requires you declare the relationships. Also check whether receiving equity has tax and liability issues, and what options you will have to exit, receive dividend payments etc.\n\nThat you've been approached is a smart move on their part. Whether you want to take some equity for a possible payout later, in exchange for surrendering at least part of your creative and editorial freedom is a personal choice.",

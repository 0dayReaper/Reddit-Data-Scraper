Many products don't achieve Product/Market Fit until they have graduated from early adopters to the wider market of customers that do not share the psychographics of an early adopter.\n\nProduct/Market Fit typically occurs after many iterative cycles with early adopters have provided you with feedback through various product validation tests, interviews, and analytics reviews of product usage. Product/Market Fit is NOT the first step to building a successful venture. It is typically the final milestone achieved during the second lifecycle stage of a startup: Validation. See the outline of a startup lifecycle in our Share Your Startup submissions.\n\nAgain, Product/Market Fit is the pinnacle of Product Validation.\n\nIt is when you have highly engaged users behaving as expected with your product as it was designed, recurring sales (recurring revenue), increased traction across all your core metrics that demonstrate product validation, and when those users/customers are so in love with your product that they are organically acting as your word of mouth marketing team (without any incentive to do so).\n\nOnce you have achieved Product/Market Fit, you can lose it. You must continue to be engaged with your users/customers to understand how to provide them with an enjoyable experience with benefits and value as time goes on. People change. Markets change. Your product and company often must change with them. Failing to do that will result in you losing Product/Market Fit.",

If you can sustain that 3 months, you're at ~500x (ignoring churn) in three months.  \n\n*If*:\n\n* you can last a few months with that growth rate, \n* churn is \"reasonable\",\n* that growth rate is on top of an interesting base # of users,\n* you'll then still have several months of runway, so that you can comfortably raise on your ludicrous growth numbers...\n\n...then may be worthwhile to keep the jet fuel on, since it'll put you in an extremely strong position to raise (at least in most industries).\n\nTwo more notes:\n\n1) I ask \"how much money\" because there is important question here about what \"like crazy\" means.  The main q here is whether your next round investors will view it as \"crazy\", or simply the cost of doing business.  This is mostly a question of CAC + reasonable ranges of CLV.  If \"like crazy\" means some absurd cost, time to stop; if it just means that you only have a tiny amount of capital but you're burning through it fast, maybe it isn't a big deal.\n\n2) I ask what base you're growing from because if that base is high enough + you've got sustained ~800% monthly growth, you should just go raise now.\n\nLastly--\n\nVery few things are going to keep that rate of growth.  To a degree, this may turn out to be a self-correcting problem.\n\nAdditionally, I'd watch churn extremely closely.  Borderline useless to \"grow\" 7%/day if you're churning rapidly.",

Look at your 30/60/90 day retention rate. LTV doesn't matter if there's no retention. If you don't have retention then you don't have PMF. If you don't have PMF then your just pouring gasoline on money then lighting it on fire. If you do have PMF then you can figure out the business model and LTV. So in other words, there's not enough value unless you have PMF(your 30/60/90 retention is good and your total customer base is growing; not dropping off after they sign up for a free trial). Then figure out if the margins are there.",

(Sounds simple, but the time it takes to monetize a sale is important, because any time you\u2019re waiting for your money, you have to factor in carrying costs.\n\nBitter truth is AC+COG &gt; Sales Price is not sustainable in any scenario. If you have 1 million customers who are all losing you money you\u2019re going to end up broke faster. (No VC I\u2019ve met would take that bet.)\n\nObviously a formula that takes into consideration churn overtime, plus carrying costs is going to be substantially more complicated than what I have described. Figuring Carrying Costs for a single customer should include the cost of all overhead over the time period before they pay (expressed as # of $ per day), divided by the number of customers. E.g. $10000 overhead per year(divide by 365 = $27.4 divided by sales or customers (1500 / 27.4 = .0182) (.0182 * 365 = $6.66) added to your COG per sale or per customer. \n\nI hope this helps you look at your business pragmatically.\nGood luck!",

Most VCs are more hesitant on \"growth at all costs\" companies. But if you have an exit strategy into revenue that you can prove out, you could try to leverage the growth rate as the biggest value for investment. If you can't raise money with that, you need to pare down expenses and re-think regardless.",

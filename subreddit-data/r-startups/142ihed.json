    "postText": "I would like to start an athletic shoe company and have been working through branding, business development and market potential for the past few weeks. I am starting to research the best method to create a prototype/first phase iteration and was wondering if there is company that can create custom shoes. \n\nThese would specifically need a certain type of sole due to being an athletic shoe, and I haven\u2019t found much on a producer. \n\nIf anyone knows of a company that might inquire about doing so, I\u2019d greatly appreciate it. I am also open to any other method of producing the shoe myself, anything in terms of shoe production is helpful!!\n\nI know I haven\u2019t given a ton information into what I am aiming to do but for now I just need some general information on potential production methods.",

So, you can directly go to Alibaba and ask a bunch of listings if they do custom projects or if they can put you in touch with their manufacturer for a revenue split. I've created multiple products this way.",

    "postText": "Around a year ago I left my job to start a company.\n\nI had around $12K in savings. Enough to cover a year of expenses and a bit more. I stopped spending money on almost everything.\n\nHow hard could that be, right? I create something, find 10-20 clients, and done. I'll make $1K per month and from there grow it to $20K MRR. No problem.\n\nWell. It didn't work that way. You all know that. I didn't. I was naive and I think I am not the only one who thinks like that.\n\nNews? Success stories? Books on self-help? podcasts? Guilt it of all of that. I thought I was smart enough. If others could do it... me? Even better.\n\nWell. I am broke now. I hate the projects I created. I hate that I spent all my money and didn't make a dollar (well I made around $60, which is even more painful than $0) not from my projects, not from a client or a company.\n\nSo the real cost is more than the money I lost. I made my girlfriend stay home for a year, we didn't do anything, we didn't buy clothes and ate the cheapest food. I feel that I have lost a year of my life.\n\nI know how to create software and how to manage a product from zero but:\n\n* Every time that I want to promote something, my stomach hurts.\n* If I share an article about my projects I feel anxious for a week.\n* When I go to a Facebook Group to suggest my apps, I feel sick.\n* If I send a private message on Twitter or Linkedin, I can't sleep.\n\nI think people are going to hate me, tell me that I am an idiot, a fake entrepreneur, that my ideas are terrible, that I suck.\n\nAnd they did many times, and I can't handle that while making $0.\n\nSo, I quit.\n\nI always wanted to write more. I love it. But I felt that I couldn't write if I wasn't successful. But I guess there are no rules.",

Please help our community be welcoming of everyone.\n* Do not judge others based on how much money was spent on a project. You have no idea of what their financial situation is nor how valuable a single $ is to them. Don't exercise Classicism here.\n* Do not judge others and devalue another's experiences just because you have experienced worse or know of others that have experienced worse.  We all experience life independently of others and establish what is our own best and worst experiences. They are all valid. You can offer advice and help another person find motivation without devaluing or scoffing at what they are experiencing.\n* Do NOT tell OP they are not cut out to be an entrepreneur.  Successful businesses are rarely (if ever) the result of one person doing it all. It's a collaborative effort. You can be an entrepreneur that is focused on key responsibilities that best suit your strengths and passions while leaning on others to fill in the gaps where you are weak.  Entrepreneurship is also a skill.  Like any skill it can be developed and improved.  Also, like any skill the experiences you have in practicing and learning such skills can cause you to have a bad reaction to furthering such skills. OP had a terrible experience as a result of not understanding the proper process to be an entrepreneur. That doesn't mean they are not cut out to become one if they learn the proper process. So, stop that nonsense.\n* Practice more compassion and empathy.\n* Don't ask OP to share names or links.  Don't ask OP to DM you.  YOU CAN DM THEM. OP can describe things without sharing any such links or names.\n* Refer to our rules in our side bar/about section.\n\nThanks! =)",

            "comment": "I started developing products to start my own company. I followed the success stories and got inspired by the stories \u201cHe/she quit their job to pursue their dreams of starting a company\u201d. \n\nI thought to quit my job and start working on my product full time.\n\nThen i took a step back and started reading failure stories. I was surprised by those stories. Generally, everyone is eager to share their success stories rather than failure stories. So there are way more failure stories than success stories. But there are way more failure people who never shared their experiences.\n\nStarting a company is tricky. Some say take risk. Some say don\u2019t risk your job. And other will argue that if your don\u2019t risk, you will never become an entrepreneur.\n\nI decided to continue my job and start building my products part time. I am working 5-6 hours a day on my products after completing my full time job. And also during weekends.\n\nBeing an entrepreneur is not always about taking risks. Risk takers surely get results. But for every successful story, There might be a failure story which was never heard.\n\nMy honest suggestion would be don\u2019t give up. Immediately try to find a way(getting a job, business, what ever you feel) to get your career and financial life back on track. Work part time building your company. Throw in extra hours if you want to finish your product quickly.\n\nAt this point, you are already 70% closer to starting your business. So don\u2019t give up. Find a way to get your financial life back on track and start building.",

Neither had any experience in the area (couple office guys pretty much). I'm talking packaged goods, not restaurant nonsense ha.\n\nThey hustled and grinded and made a nice little niche for themselves.\n\nThey aren't millionaires, but aren't living in poverty, seems they're making an okay living. I haven't talked to him at length about it but it's definitely \"no boss\" situation which can be good and bad (bad in that your partner might say he doesn't feel like coming in on time).\n\nI think for them it was 3 months in where they quit and did it full time. Honestly I'm a bit jealous, but mostly proud, that a guy with an advanced degree, safe well paying \"office job\" actually made the jump all-in.\n\nI'd wager he's making less at the moment, but there's always that upside chance of financial boon, not to mention the pride in creating something yourself and having no boss. They have some cool kitchen toys as well. Beats the office slog in my opinion.\n\nAlso to be honest, even if the whole thing went down in flames at some point (which it's 2 years old at this point and humming along) -- at least you have tons of experience. And I respect that.",

The product has to arrive first, then you become an entrepreneur when you develop that product. You can't do it the other way around.\n\nIf you have a product idea that is validated, something you care about, something you have knowledge about and something that will make money, then all the other stuff is easy. Well.. I don't mean sales is easy. But getting finance to hire a really good salesperson off the back of a well-validated and tested product is.\n\nBut, well done for letting yourself be creative and try things out - something a lot of people don't have the confidence to do. Don't listen to the people saying you should have stayed in your job until you had paying customers - those people will probably be in a full-time job forever because they lack the leap of faith required. You had the right motive, and took the right level of risk, just without great execution.\n\nIt sounds like you're a bit burnt out. Don't give up doing what you do.. but next time, your journey has to be about the product, even if the product is just an idea that you talk about to other people at first.\n\nOh and, a word on budget: don't think in terms of burn rate next time. Set a predefined budget, a predefined timescale and stick to it. Need more cash to get over the line? Investment or debt. I say this because a good investor or a bank won't give you the cash unless you're a \"legitimate concern\". It can be a cold hard awakening when you're refused a loan, or turned down for investment - it happened to me and it made me realise that yes, I should stop spending money on that project, and move onto something else.\n\nIf you want to chat more, happy to hear from you on DM.

Speaking generally, and not targeted at the OP, some people watch Silicon Valley and think \"hey, that's easy, I wanna do that too!\". It's especially easy to fall into that trap if you have some tech know-how/skill, too.\n\nI've always said there are three main components to having a digital product success: Tech knowledge to build the product, Industry knowledge (of the industry your product will target), and sales acumen. If you have 2 out of 3, you're gonna have a great time. Only 1? You're probably best suited to a day job. Nearly nobody has all 3 so don't beat yourself up if you're a great programmer with a great product in an industry you know inside out, but you're a crap salesperson.",

Bear in mind that the Covid situation for most people meant staying at home and doing absolutely nothing, you on the other hand went out of your way to build something of your own.\n\nYou also need to consider and take serious stock of the treasure trove of lessons that you learnt. Everyone on my linkedin feed who were \"naive\", started their own business and failed were able to leverage that to later join a large company who would look at that kind of experience favourably.\n\nI understand that you lost a lot of money doing that, I'm sorry that it panned out that way. \n\nI imagine that the desire to start your own business may have stemmed from the desire to no longer be a slave to a boss, however you learnt that it's not any better being a slave to your own projects. This sort of lesson is not something that can be easily learnt and I'm sure your children one day will be able to take that lesson you taught them and make a more calculated decision.\n\nI also totally understand how you feel about your current mental state at the moment. I am also in a rut about doing work and i feel a wave of anxiety hit me everytime I'm supposed to sit down and write code.",

Never quit a job nor engagement until you're confident of success.  That bullshit some claim about focus is just that, bullshit; people say focus because they're ignorant of any other meaningful advice to give. Always, always, work while starting something.\n\n* It takes 6x longer than you think and 10x longer than you hope.  Plan accordingly. Now, plan again, it will take longer. \n\n* Team team team team.  Job 1, day 1, find people who agree.  Job 2, every day, keeping finding people who agree and will join you.  \n\n* 90% of people won't get it and will tell you no. This never goes away.  If you think they'll say you suck now, welcome to being an entrepreneur.   Get over that, that comes with the territory.\n\n* Marketing is the most important thing you do.  Not promoting. Not sales. Not advertising.  Marketing. Learn the difference.  Marketing is how companies avoid costly mistakes and failures.  Avoid it at your peril. \n\n* Do NOT buy into the hype.  The shows, books, and local startup thing, they're selling something and you're the customer.  Entrepreneurship is a leading cause of mental health issues and money lost; it is not for most. If anyone is saying it's easy or is encouraging you, be wary. \n\n* Being a startup is not about the idea.  Ever.  It's about thousand of ideas, hundreds of thousands, testing them constantly (daily) and discarding most of them. Most of what you do will fail. Focus on your mission, then a vision; everything else is a pivot as fast and efficiently as possible.\n\n* Lastly, and perhaps most important, it is NOT about finding success; it's about avoiding complete failure.  The trick no one tells you is that \"fail fast\" is actually very right, but not fail as in 'quit as a startup,' rather as in: try and abandon things fast.  When 90% of everyone fails and quits, the trick isn't trying to be the anomoly in the 10%, it's working so as not to be in the 90%. Sounds like the same thing but it's not!!!  Too many founders/startups get enamored by and drawn to the wins and success.  If you have a win, buy yourself a nicer cup of coffee and get back to work discarding failures.  Most startups fail because of confirmation bias, zombie status, and listening to customers telling them the wrong things.  Always, ALWAYS, think, \"this is wrong, this is not good enough, and do better,\" even with wins, \"always better,\" because you are NOT successful until you are.",

This is where having a non-technical cofounder is a huge help.\n\nEveryone always scoffs at a non-tech person in a tech company, but a good market and salesman that believes in the product has no issue with promoting the product, making sales calls, promoting articles, cold emails etc. \n\nIf the idea of sales and marketing makes you feel anxious, remember it's normal. It's been engrained in us that marketing and sales is inherently slimy - we all picture the care sales guy or the door-to-door sales guy. Marketing isn't sleezy, especially if it's a great product.\n\nIMO, your next course of action is to either force yourself to learn sales/marketing (for me, that was doing door-to-door sales in high school. Best job of my life in terms of teaching me how to sell and interact with others). On the flip side, give away some equity and find a non-technical founder to focus on sales and marketing.\n\nThe notion of \"build it and they'll come\" is nonsense. Marketing is make or break, and if you can't stomach the idea of doing it you either have to change your way of thinking or find someone to do it for you.",

The reasons were:\n\n1. No one actually does what they say they will do.\n2. No one works as hard as you are willing to work.\n3. No one is willing to risk as much as you will risk.\n4. You will back the team, and then when its their turn they won't.\n5. Once 1-4 happens, it will never be corrected even if you talk about it, and if you make the decision to continue, they will put you into worker bee status and think its great and never give you back what you should have in return.\n\nI'm sure there are teams that do well. I couldn't make it work. I would have liked to work in an environment where we're all chipping in and can just fluidly rely on each other, but in my case it became a politics game and if I played those games, the business wouldn't grow, and if I didn't, they would end up taking advantage of me.\n\nMine was a pretty negative experience and my solution was to just cut everyone out and do it all on my own. I would say that the main thing to know is that true partnership is like marriage. You're going to have issues and you need to know that if you commit to that person, there's a way to handle it.\n\nFeel free to direct message me if you want to know more.",

Success is anecdotal but process is more important than anything in my opinion. Anyone can get lucky, but I'll put bets behind someone who has a consistent process. \n\nHas your girlfriend stuck around for that time? If so, maybe yo came out knowing that you have a hell of a back-bone in the form of a girlfriend. \n\nI beat myself up a lot during my non-successes that even when the success came I couldn't even enjoy it.\n\nDon't worry dude, you're better for giving it a shot than not and if you do continue, you're better armed for the next time you try. \n\nAnd this feeling is common. The last failure I had stung so damn hard I was ashamed to tell anyone anything about what happened. It's a horrible feeling but it's part and parcel of being an entrepreneur.

The market is giving you feedback that it doesn't like what you're selling, the current way you're selling it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's good that you're not \"chasing your passions\" - that's stupid. Your passion is actually whatever you're good at and can dominate other competitors at, that's my opinion. Once you're well off, you can play with some passion projects. If your passion is cooking, you live and breathe cooking, but you suck ass at cooking - I'd want to look at it differently. Maybe you weren't meant to be a chef, but meant to make some cooking gadget. Maybe you weren't even meant to make some cooking gadget, but meant to sell your \"graphic design social media services\" to chefs or other cooking entrepreneurs. There are always multiple sides to every coin. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you give up, you'll have failed forsure - then all that workand learning will have gone to waste. Your wounds will be what gives you wisdom. The struggle makes you stronger. Each failure puts you one step closer to your goals. But if you give up, you'll never hit it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow i'm not saying go borrow money or do some crazy stuff. All I'm saying, is that you need to recalculate &amp; re-evaluate things. You'll have to pick up a job, or some hustle where you know you can make money. You'll have to dedicate your leisure/relax time to even more studying. And hey, if something's not working - there is no one to blame but yourself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR - Stop trying to stick a 3 pronged plug into a 2 pronged hole wall outlet. If you see it doesn't fit, maybe you try an adapter or something. If you keep trying to shove that 3 pronged plug into the 2 pronged hole, you deserve to be electrocuted. After you get electrocuted, you will be a bit smarter though. Keep that in mind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd whatever you don't know, there are people who can help you with it. You can find freelancers anywhere online. It doesn't sound to me like you shot your shot and failed, so much as it sounds like you're giving up instead. You're doing this not only for you, but for those around you as well. Good luck.",

Social media is inundated with people who have 10 year business journeys and who love to only share the last 6 months that catapulted them into success. For new business owners, founders, entrepreneurs, etc. -- it's so easy to jump into business and think that this whole thing is easier than it really is. I empathize with you. My first day in business, I blew $10,000 on marketing for my business. I had zero customers and really zero idea what I was even selling. \n\n* 2) I think you need to let go of the shame. We've all been there. We've all had those days, weeks, and even months of near zero revenue. This whole thing is such a journey. I think you should disconnect yourself a little from whatever stories you read online, even here, and get out in the community (as best you can with COVID) and have real, honest discussions with other founders. I think what you'll find is a really common trend. People who exhaustingly threw themselves into their idea, and who finally saw success much farther (longer) down the road than they anticipated.\n\nOn this second point, I talked to a guy on my podcast who is a really renowned dentist. Been on all sorts of shows/national news stations as a guest. He didn't give some sort of secret insight on how he made his business successful. Instead, he said, \"It's going to take any person around 5 years to find any real, meaningful success for their business... and for me, it took 10.\" \n\nIt's an honest look, and a whole lot less sexy than what gets portrayed online.",

And I did some math and I evaluated What an orthopedic surgeon would be spending on avertising per month if he was an entrepreneur and this on 30 years period. \n\nWith some parameters and variables I have got a dollar price. Then I consider how much time, intellects and risks his job demands. I came up with some metrics and projections. I can't tell more. Employees work on goals-set and entrepreneurs set goals to work on. Before becoming someone else's boss, you must first become your own employee. to do the hard work first then scale by investing in marketing every month. That's the part all smart technicians don't see before starting their own companies. I hope it helps!",

I lost $2.0M of my, investor\u2019s and the government\u2019s money, and 5 years of my \u201clife\u201d to a business I started.\n\nFirst off, everything you are feeling is normal and justifiable. It\u2019s part of a 5 step process of grieving. The steps are denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. While the internet may tell you that these steps happen in order, the reality is that life is not black and white. You\u2019ll go through any number of these all at once, or individually, for a period of time. How long? That\u2019s up to you. But I promise you, you will get past it and move on.\n\nSecond, nothing comes without sacrifice. You had the courage to do what 99% of this world won\u2019t. You stepped up to bat and took a swing. People here are going to question your approach and try to tell you what you did wrong. None of that matters right now for the way you feel. What matters is that you remember that you played the fucking game. Sure, you feel like this was a colossal strikeout. But you learned some seriously valuable lessons here and no one here can explain it better than your gut can tell you. No one. Because there is a difference between learning from a textbook and learning from life. It\u2019s easy to talk about validation and lean model canvas, but it\u2019s fucking hard to read the subtle cues of facial expressions and body language of a potential customer and how that translates to your product, go to market strategy and revenue. Those who don\u2019t know what I mean don\u2019t really get the art - what people say isn\u2019t always what they mean or want.\n\nThird, your life will go on and you\u2019re now wiser because of it. This isn\u2019t the end of the world. Your girlfriend still loves you, and she supported you. Now go support her. Invest in the relationship that just went through the ringer. She\u2019ll love you more because of it, and you\u2019ll rebuild your confidence and desire to start something again. Look, people who start things and go all in have an itch that always needs to be scratched. Don\u2019t measure success by money or users. Measure success by how many times you have gotten back up to swing again. Then, one day, it will come.\n\nIt took me 30 months to get over my last fuck up. Really, it was hard. But I\u2019m now on to the next one equipped with more wisdom, more experience, and an even stronger desire to scratch that itch.\n\nYou got this dude. It\u2019s a process. Write down what you learned, process your emotions, invest in your family, and don\u2019t be afraid to do it again.\n\nEDIT: Spelling",

All my attempts ended in loss of money and I haven't earned a cent yet. \n\nBut I'm a creator, I love solving problems, so naturally I won't (and can't) stop trying. Every failed attempt taught me something. You learn from failures. \n\nI agree that for every 1 successful story there are 1000 of failures that you'll likely never hear about. I think starting a business is a combination of skills, networking, perseverance and luck. Yeah, luck, whoever tells you there's no luck involved is either lying and trying to sell you a \"success recipe\" or was just lucky himself and ashamed of that. \n\nBut the good part is that if you try enough times, you'll beat this probability game and you will succeed eventually.",

This mindset trips so many beginner entrepreneurs (myself included), because it couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nProduct is just one ingredient in the recipe. You need the other ingredients to make it successful: market, sales, marketing, finance...  And your job as an entrepreneur is to navigate through all of them. Especially in the early stages - where the boundaries between these areas are blurred and you have to dance around the edges constantly. \n\nIt seems like you suffer from impostor syndrome when it comes to marketing, but feel confident enough when it comes to executing your software and product plan. \n\nThis could just be because you lack the experience or don't have a process in place for executing the other business activities. In which case, no wonder you feel anxious doing it - you're \"winging it\" outside your comfort zone without a game plan and hoping for the best... how would that not be anxiety-provoking?\n\nOne of the biggest aha moments I've had about this journey is realizing that everything is an engineering problem: distribution is an engineering problem; growth is an engineering problem; profitability is an engineering problem; product is an engineering problem (duh). \n\nWhen you treat every aspect of the business as an engineering problem - and you develop an action plan for each problem - everything suddenly becomes less stressful and more manageable.",

            "comment": "Anecdote time. \n\nIt was 2006. I finished college, and right there and then started my own adtech company. I had an idea, and did _some_ amount of validation, but most of all I really wanted it to work. I did so many things wrong. Over the year I built out the company, we had some customers, but never had a big breakthrough. I bootstrapped the company myself, and at the end of the 7 year ride was about $150k in debt with family. \n\nI found an escape. Some company wanted to acquire us, but it was for less than $150k. Fair enough, I ended up with about $40k of debt left, but fuck it, I wanted out and it was more manageable than $150k. \n\nIn the years that followed, it became obvious to me how much I learned in the years I did my startup. I ended up doing freelance work for another startup for a few years, was hired as a CTO of a video analytics startup, and now for the past 2 years am doing remote freelance work for two startups from home. I earn more than I could think of, and in hindsight, I would never have reached this point if I didn\u2019t have those early years of experience. The $40k in debt has earned itself back many times in just the past 2 years. :)\n\nMoral of the story: consider the money you \u201clost\u201d as an investment in yourself, a college degree if you will. Take a moment of breath, because you sound like you are very tired, and set a plan for yourself. This experience was just the beginning, and you\u2019ll be back on your feet in no time!\n\nFeel free to reach out to me if you like to bounce some ideas or just vent. :)",

It took me almost 3 years to build out 6 Commercial Truck Part product lines because I was working full-time building five other companies as COO of a group of companies, going through a nasty divorce living in a camper and raising 10 children.\n\nI was overworked underpaid and half of my income plus medical went to child support.\n\nMy company sells initiative commercial truck parts which I know nothing of I couldn't even tell you what trucks they all go on or how to put them on but I know how to find margin and manufacture stuff.\n\nStarted with maybe $200 and just inched my way to the starting line.\n\nYour four is what we're in now and we're doing 400 to $600,000 a month in sales would 70 + percent profit margin. Still only three people in the company and I do 99% of everything myself.\n\nThe reason we blew up is because I prepared the foundation and then one day November 2019 my job found out that we were doing okay and they fired me.\n\nI started making fifty to a hundred and fifty phone calls cold calls every single day today I've made 71 an acquired 16 new customers one is a 5 location dealership chain in the Northeast.\n\n\nI tell everyone there is no overnight success it's always going to take way more money time resources energy than you ever planned for and it's going to hurt your relationships because building any business is a wild beast.\n\n\nGet a job take some time to lick your wounds look at what you did right and rebuild your relationship with your girlfriend.\n\nThen start over draw the Mind map and map out everything you can find your pain points and then Whittle away at them one by one with no expected timeline.\n\n I believe you can do this.\n\nYou have just suffered through a very challenging season but it was a gift.\n\n\nListen to mfceo podcast old episodes 300 of them.\n\nListen to Ed mylett, Jim Rohn, how I built this,......\n\nI do these things every single day I wake up at 5 a.m. to go to bed at 10 p.m.\n\nYou can do this it doesn't matter what the journey looks like as your growing because one day it turns a corner and everybody's jaw drops.\n\n\nMy 19 year old stepdaughter was ashamed of my wife and I because we were Food Bank broke for so long living in that camper.\n\nShe has a long-term boyfriend they'll probably get married and both of his parents are lawyers for Boeing or some other big company and they make a very strong six figure salary each and have a nice home and things like that.\n\n\nLet's just say we passed them up because we make six figures a month easy now and it's only growing and its residual. I asked her if it's going to be embarrassing in May when we have a cookout and I drive up in a Ferrari with my wife?\n\n\nYou are an airplane and once you get off the Runway you're going to be in the clouds and turbulence for a long time but once you break through your life is different.\n\n\nI forgot to tell you over the last 25 years I failed it for businesses on my own one so bad that me my wife and six kids were evicted and had to eat at a food bank at a homeless shelter for a month.",

I dont do much online because we are still very tiny compared to the two entrenched manufacturers we are competing against. I had a customer asked me last week if we had a drag racer NASCAR sponsorship like one of our competitors does.\n\nI laughed that they thought we were that big. Will break 10 million dollars this year in sales but that is a small piece of what our competition is doing and has done for decades.\n\nWe are the first to Market with an import version of the parts though. That gives such massive price advantage that if you do it right you can get ahead. When we started it was a recession and then tariffs and then trade Wars + tariffs and now a pandemic. There's no way our competitions going to restructure their whole business model to an import model to compete. I figure once they really know who we are we will get bought out for a very large sum of money or we will sell out to an oem that uses these parts in massive quantities year after year.\n\nI would like to fly under the radar as much as possible. Reddit the closest thing to a sales team I have to talk to during the day while I'm making calls.\n\nI'm happy to help anyone with the how to that I can.

What's crazy is that it's typically the GOOD decisions that make me anxious (partnering with a AAA game studio, partnering with indie studios, requests from other companies to work with us).  It makes my stomach hurt and I can't sleep too.  It sucks.  There is something to be said about just working for a company and having a steady paycheque.  \n\n\nThese are the moments that it dawns on me that the business is real, and am now responsible to put dinner on the table for 10 people.

Creating connections, working with smart people, building products, seeing people use and LOVE those products and praise you for a job well done... Going to an expo where everyone knows who you are...  \n\n\nIt's not all bad, but some days it feels like there is only bad.  \n\n\nMy shitty advice:  ***Try to find the not bad.***  \n\n\n/endrant.",

Fast forward to years and I'm back to a corporate job with not much to show for the two years. \n\nThe silver lining is that I learned a lot, and I hope you did too. About business, accounting, taxes, marketing, etc, sure but the best thing that came from my experience was what I learned about myself.\n\nFor some reasons when I running my own business I was too scared to promote it.  Sort of like what you described.  But for some strange reason, now that I've gone it alone and failed, and am working for someone else, I am promoting their shit LIKE CRAZY, and it doesn't bother me nearly half as much!\n\nI think this is happening partly because I have this disconnect now, that my job is not ME. When I was a business owner, everything I was selling was ME, and I was so scared of judgement.  Now I'm just working on someone else's stuff and so there is not the level of existential risk with what I'm doing now.\n\nI also have had the catharsis of trying something that I had always wanted to do.  I think this has held me back in the past and now that I've done it, even though I failed, I can sort of \"let it go\" and get on with other things.\n\nI don't know man, I'm ranting now, but your post just really resonated with me.  Let me know if you want to commiserate over zoom sometime \ud83d\ude2d",

After all, 1 year is nothing.  If you really want to be an entrepreneur, you need to look at this as the long-play. You'll be eating Ramen Noodles for at least 3-5 more years before you start breaking even. But then, towards years 7-10, you'll start turning exponential profits.

You had some really good feedback, even from other developers warning you how much was required to actually achieve such a thing as a one-person show.  This would have been ideally step one before you quit your day job, you got some good leads, and questionable feedback on your idea. \n\nYou had potential customers giving you lots of their thoughts on this service, and developers who were probably experienced in this warning you. Did you follow up any of those developers to get an idea of what this would take? Did you follow up any of those posters on r/Nomads giving you feedback on your idea? I saw that you replied to them, but it was generally to mirror what they said/agree with them.\n\nI think your biggest lesson is to listen.\n\nEven though you didn't really ask validating questions to ID your customer's pain points, they told you a lot.  \n\nGenerally, you would do that first before quitting your day job and before you start building a product that wasn't really geared toward solving problems.\n\nI'm a little torn between thinking this is a legit post, or a rehash of what you posted last month. \n\nHaving said that i appreciate the discussion you've generated about the basics rules/principles of startups, so thank you for that. I myself paid $10,000 to learn various rules when i could have simply listened, but some of us need to learn the hard way, and for me, it probably won't be the last time.\n\nBest of luck with your future endeavours, and i hope this becomes a valuable learning point.

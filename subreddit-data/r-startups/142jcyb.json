My dream is to start a food business, but at the moment, I don't have the funds to invest in a food truck or physical location. I would appreciate any advice from those who have started from a similar point and managed to grow their business.",

If not, going to work in one seems like an obvious first step.",

I'm not even from Canada, but I know about them. YouTube Shorts / TickTock made it kinda popular.\n\nOf course, there are a lot of factors to consider, and their model might not be suitable for you. But just as an example - they are good at it. But, better see what your competitors do. Good luck",

Starting a food business on a tight budget can be a challenge, but it's definitely possible with the right strategies.  \n\n\nOne way to get started is by catering for small events or offering private chef services. This way, you can start to build a reputation and customer base without having to invest in a physical location right away. As you gain more customers and increase your income, you can then consider expanding your business.  \n\n\nSocial media, especially Instagram, can also be a powerful tool for promoting your business. With high-quality photos and engaging posts, you can attract potential customers and grow your online presence. If you find managing social media overwhelming, agencies like Ascendviral specialize in organic Instagram growth and could be a valuable resource.",

For one, they know the people locally who invest in restaurants, but they also make excellent customers, grassroots marketers, and potential partners/employees.  \n\n\nIf you've never worked at a restaurant, I'd highly recommend it. The lessons learned will be invaluable (what to do, what not to do). Social media/catering jobs are good options, but I'd recommend doing this while working at a restaurant.  \n\n\nAs a note, \"unique menus\" typically require more significant marketing and location and style becomes hugely important. You need to find a way if possible to establish that there is a market for what you are doing and then build your customer base where they are",

Little pizza shop is about $150K.",

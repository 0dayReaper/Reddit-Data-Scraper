    "postText": "This is the story of my second biggest regret in life.\n\nDon't make the same mistakes I made.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u201cYou want to do what now?\u201d\n\nAbout 8 years ago, being young and naive, I decided I wanted to build apps for a living.\n\nMy dad was not happy about it.\n\nAs a graduating engineer, I was supposed to get into consultancy or FAANG.\n\nI didn't want to follow the \"traditional\" path so I decided to move abroad and work for a startup.\n\nIn my spare time, I worked on a productivity app I'd created. There was no name for this \"category\" of apps yet.\n\nThe startup I worked for went bust. In hindsight, I think the only reason they hired some foreigner without experience, is because that would get them a grant.\n\nInstead of going back home, I decided to stay in one of the most expensive cities in the world, and continue working on the productivity app.\n\nAt this point I had found a co-founder, a guy who moved there around the same time as me.\n\nWe became good friends and I crashed on his couch for 7 months. All we did was get up, drink coffee in the little garden and work on the app all day.\n\nIt was an amazing time. We started to get some users and implemented a \"feedback wall\". Instead of asking for money, we would ask for a feedback email to unlock all the features of the app.\n\nIt worked wonders. The emails came in and they kept coming.\n\nEach day, I would open the mailbox and go through the emails one by one, extensively talking to each user and thanking them from the bottom of my heart.\n\nI would put all the feedback in a big excel sheet and group similar feedback together.\n\nEach day we would work on the most requested items. Then we would check more emails. We repeated this for months.\n\nWe got lucky. Our initial users came from some app aggregator that mentioned us. We got hundreds of signups in the first few weeks. Without that, we would have probably given up straight away.\n\nThe iterative improvements worked. Feature requests got implemented quickly. users were happy.\n\nBetween the two of us, it was hard to find a way to communicate fast enough. Even though we were living together and working together, we still managed to send tens of emails per day to each other.\n\nIt was magic. It felt like we were completely in sync, working towards a common goal.\n\nWe marketed the app by posting on Reddit and submitting it to various blogs.\n\nAt one point, we almost killed the app by overriding the local database on the phones with an update. Some people lost their data, but we worked through the night and implemented a fix. The damage was contained.\n\nLater, we decided to ask for money instead of feedback.\n\nA first payment rolled in. And then another.\n\nHoly crap, this was actually working. People were gladly paying.\n\nAt this point we had some money coming in. I guess we were ramen profitable, in the sense that we could pay for rent and ramen.\n\nGrowth was stalling a bit though. We ran out of ideas. We implemented all the feedback that could pass for \"sensible\".\n\nWe ran out of steam. Doubt showed up.\n\n\"Is this idea even big enough?\" \"Maybe the market is just too small\"\n\nNo-one had told me that doubt is normal. That startup founders typically go through a lot of bad periods. That actually, we were one of the lucky ones. That initial growth shouldn't come as easy.\n\nAnd that we definitely shouldn't take it for granted.\n\nAt the time, I didn't realize that there is a vast array of possibilities between \"billion dollar business\" and \"failure\". We had been brainwashed by the go-big-or-go-home unicorn VC mentality.\n\nThen my cofounder emailed me:\n\nI am tempted to make a push for some funding from a startup accelerator - with business plan and everything. Slowly I am coming to the realisation that with funding we can progress much faster..and we can concentrate on it 100%.\n\nSo we applied to all the accelerators in the city, including the worst one.\n\nAll accelerators rejected us.\n\nThen the worst one emailed us that, despite the rejection, we could join. Some other startup had declined.\n\nThis accelerator ripped us off in a very obvious way, which we didn't realize at the time.\n\nAnyway, we accepted.\n\nThe accelerator program was complete chaos. The first week they told each startup they should write down one metric and they were gonna track the performance of that metric every week.\n\nThey literally never mentioned those metrics again.\n\nOne of the main guys from the accelerator threatened us. I would characterize him as a \"demotivational speaker\".\n\nWe were in this weird mental state. We were one of the fastest growing startups in the batch. Other founders were asking us how we did it. Our startup was kind of growing by itself. And we were super demotivated.\n\nAt some point we stopped showing up. Our excuse was that the commute to the accelerator took 2 hours of work from us each day. In reality, we were fed up.\n\nOne of the guys from the accelerator had a good connection at Google. After weeks of nagging, he contacted the guy and he got us into the \"real\" app game.\n\nFrom one day to the next, they basically flipped a switch and we got thousands of downloads a day.\n\nDon't let anyone tell you the game is not rigged. Connections are everything.\n\nThis was pretty much the only thing we got out of that accelerator. It was a good thing though.\n\nThey say a startup dies when the founders lose motivation. That was certainly the case for us. The demo day was great, lots of interested investors, but I was dead inside. I was fake smiling.\n\nI decided to travel around a bit. My co-founder took another job. And the money kept coming in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome backpacker in Asia told me I'm living the dream. I felt like a failure.\n\nWhile in Singapore I got a crazy bout of renewed motivation. I camped out in a Starbucks and built the iOS version of the app in about a month.\n\nI thought that would save us. I launched the new version on Reddit, it made a big splash but then died out. I expected it to at least double or triple our sales.\n\nIf I had had a bit more patience, I would have noticed that this version was definitely growing and gaining momentum.\n\nI expected too much, too quickly.\n\nWe lost all motivation again, just as quickly as it had reappeared.\n\nI'm not sure what my thought process was at the time, but I randomly decided to google \"how to sell your app\" and sent this random app guy an email:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe guy asked for some more stats which we provided.\n\nHe then offered about $55k.\n\nEven though this was less than a year's revenue for us, we seriously considered it.\n\nWe were fed up with the whole situation and decided to go through with the deal.\n\nBut the investors said no.\n\nWe then kept working on it for another year or so while we were both doing other stuff. The revenue was pretty stable.\n\nThe buyer was extremely patient and kept checking in.\n\nI was traveling around the world and not being very responsive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRereading this whole email thread, I'm in awe of the sheer perseverance of the buyer.\n\nAfter almost exactly one year, the investor issues were resolved and we came to an agreement, which was more than double the original price.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAt no point in the process did I know who I was talking to. I had never seen this guy's face. We never called or met in real life.\n\nStill I was quite convinced it was all legit.\n\nSo we got the money, we subtracted the investors' cut, divided by two and paid taxes.\n\nThere was not much left in the end.\n\nNow, more than 5 years later, the app is still online. By all indications it makes more yearly revenue than ever.\n\nThe buyer is doing minimal updates, just enough to keep the app alive. They get quite a few 1 star ratings, but they're still coasting on the original reviews and goodwill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan't say it doesn't sting a little bit. But these days I'm mostly happy for him. He made a good deal.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nNot sure if there are any lessons here. Maybe that you should not take things for granted when you're young. Chances are you just got lucky.\n\nMaybe that you should squeeze every last drop of opportunity out of the hand you're dealt. You might not get another chance, so don't give up when the going gets tough.\n\nI see many indie hackers selling too soon.\n\nMaybe that life is mostly a random search, until it isn't. Once you find a good wave, jump on your board and hold on for dear life.\n\nMaybe that you should always shop around and compare prices, whether you're buying a car or selling an app. I regret not asking for outside opinions. I regret not having a strong support network of other creators and founders. I regret not at least putting the app for sale on a public forum.\n\nMaybe that you should properly read and understand the legal documents you're signing.\n\nI think I mostly regret giving up while there were still so many paths to discover. So many ways to grow, even though we both thought we had explored all options.\n\nI now realize a good app on the app stores is real estate. It doesn't just go away.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm happy now. Lots of doors have opened for me since I sold our app. And we helped many people. I'm proud of that.\n\nBut the itch is still there.\n\nThat's why I'm starting again. I'm taking one year off from freelancing, and I'll try to build 18 projects in one year.\n\nTo new beginnings \ud83d\ude4f\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nOriginal post [here](https://shadowysupercoder.com/how-i-sold-my-app-for-100k-via-email-and-why-i-regret-it/)\n\nAs always, much love\n\n\u2013 Shadowy",

            "comment": "Annuity businesses don't need much tweaking. You just let them run the lifecycle. If you get enough small ones like the person who picked yours up, then you'll have a pretty good annuity stream coming in. \n\nThat's why they were so patient with you. \n\nYou could have kept it going but how dedicated would you have been to it? You would need to shift it to an annuity model and start another project, ignoring your firstborn while doing it. \n\nThis is something a lot of people find problematic. Love it, and leave it, and 1 star reviews will happen.\n\nThink about it from a gaming standpoint. A company puts out a game and that's that. You can still download the game and pay for it on Steam though, and it's priced accordingly. You can buy 20 year old games on there. There has been no work done on these for years or a decade plus. The authors detached themselves from the product and shifted it to annuity.\n\nMaybe going forward you can look at that as the model for how you build next. With the underlying exit strategy for each app as being an annuity business.\n\nYou had it right when you were thinking about limited markets, you just failed to realize an annuity model from it. \n\nI've been in startups since the mid 90s. The number one dream that needs to be crushed like a bug is the Facebook dream. The amount of people who have told me in various iterations of being the next AOL to the next Facebook it entirely too damned high.\n\nThose most successful stay in their lane and have realistic dreams and ambitions. I know people with around 10 apps that are all annuity in pay-to-own or ad based. Organically grown through around 10 years of work. Successfully making the company a few million a year. This allows for good salaries for the two \"founders\" and enough for a few employees and contractors when needed. \n\nThere are SO many people out there just like that.",

I was too unrealistic in my dream and got demotivated because we were not the next Facebook.. ridiculous in hindsight but I think there are many, many people like this. This is why I'm a bit skeptical about all these claims by investors and VCs and all this startup talk. Of course they want you to raise funding, for them you're a lottery ticket... For you it's your whole life.",

Sounds like a great experience and one that will help you in your future pursuits in ways that you won't even sometimes realize.\n\nSince it's now June 2022, I wanted to check in and see how your 18 projects in a year are going??\n\nVery ambitious - so i hope you're being nice to yourself this time around :)",

From \"*is this actually a problem a lot of people want solved*\" to \"*is my solution the right one?*\" to \"*what if I wake up tomorrow and a competitor has just blown my product out of the water*\" to \"*what the fuck am I even doing*\". \n\nEvery founder (and tbh this sub also) always talk like they've got it all figured out. But the truth is, market research can be hard or faulty, PMF can't be assessed instantly nor is it static and importantly, we all go through days we think we're hot shit and the next day question all our decisions in life.\n\nThis journey can often feel like you're alone, steering a ship amid a sea of ambiguity while battling your own insecurities. It's hard and there's no prize for just trying hard.\n\nI'm not sure if I even have a coherent point to make here.

It's better you scale it up when you decide you feel like it, rather than sell it and let someone else do it. The pain of watching someone equally capable as you scale your business is probably greater than the pain of watching it wither away under your own ownership. The only real reason to sell is if you really need the short-term money or you don't have the time to maintain it.\n\nOn another note, it's fortunate that today's developers would rarely feel the urge to sell at less than 2x ARR. The industry has such crazy standards now that many developers *expect* at least 5x ARR. Great story though, thanks for sharing. I'm sure you learned a lot and will have success in the future.",

            "comment": "The story is typical to what I see in financial markets. People sell the stock and it keeps going higher and higher. Then they would write in forums how they sold too early and missed on huge profits. But when stock crashes after they sold - they are so happy that managed to to get out with a profit. \nSame is here - OP feel demotivated because they sold app and its still brings money for the new owner. But if that app would not exist anymore - OP would be happy that they managed to get at least 100K before killing it completely. \nMorale of the story - decision was right at the the time it was made. It's so easy to evaluate yesterday decision from todays perspective.",

You didn't get out too soon.\n\nIt was clear from your writing that at the time you just lost motivation for the app. It's important to understand that projects succeed not just because of the right idea at the right time with the right execution, but also with the right entrepreneur and the right people. If you were at a place then that couldn't see a way out, then you yourself made a win by getting out profitably, making it as a win on your belt for all to see, let go and move on to something that excites you.\n\nYou will come back later to working on a new project with much bigger enthusiasm and valuable experience but without the baggage. Had you stayed with that app, who knows, it may have depressed you so much that you would have just abandoned it and decided to abandon tech altogether.",

I have developed an end-end real estate web application to buy, rent, sell homes. It has a great design. But I am not sure if I want to work on it for the rest of my life as I don't have much passion for real estate.\n\nSo my question is, should I work on it for some time until I acquire the users and then sell the app? or should I sell the design and code without spending any more time on that? If yes, where can I sell my app and code?\n\nThank you.",

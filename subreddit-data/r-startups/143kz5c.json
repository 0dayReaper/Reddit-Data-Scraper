    "postText": "Anyone have experience in selling to churches? I\u2019m creating a product and I\u2019m finding it difficult to get in contact with a decision maker who I can pitch the product to and get some feedback on whether they or the church would use the product. The product can be demoed, but isn\u2019t for sale yet. I\u2019d like to demo and get a list of leads for the future to come back to. It\u2019s difficult because of a few reasons:\n\n- they are seemingly only operating on Sunday (makes sense)\n- The pastors can be a bit hard to get ahold of. No contact information is ever listed for them. \n- There\u2019s no easy way to cold call as there\u2019s no lists one can purchase that I know of and I can\u2019t find an efficient way other than Google Maps to aggregate that data\n\nShort of quite literally going to church, and a different church every Wednesday and Sunday, I\u2019m not sure how I can efficiently prospect\u2026",

I\u2019d confess that I committed the sin of hubris and created something god himself would envy and need to be in this very booth as well if he knew how much this would benefit his children on their mission to spread the good word. I\u2019d suggest I would be willing to offer an early evangelist discount on their SaaS subscription package to their house of worship as an act of penance for the absolution of my sins. I just need a quick signature and a sign of the cross and I\u2019ll get them set up asap. \ud83d\ude4f",

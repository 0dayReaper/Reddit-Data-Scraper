    "postText": "Hey everyone: my second product of the year is off the ground and it's been good so far! In just a month, we've managed to pull in 200K page views and nearly 100K visitors. It even made waves on social media with our apps trending here and there.\n\nNow comes the tricky part. The bills for external services we've used, like Vercel, Supabase, and Upstash, are starting to come in. We've introduced pricing to start monetizing, but\u2026., nudging free users to become paying customers is proving to be tougher than I\u2019ve thought.\n\nI'm really curious to know if any of you indie-founders out there have found magic formulas or techniques that helped convert users. And, another thing, I'm eager to reach out to an international audience. I feel they might be more open to paying for our services, but so far, breaking into that market hasn't been easy.\n\nJust a heads up, I'm pretty new to all this, so any advice or guidance would mean to me. Thanks!",

Free users are only really worth advertising revenue once you have 1M+. The best use of your free users is to talk to them and understand more about your value proposition. Hopefully, some of then have paid, age your should take to them face to face to understand why.",

You also have to figure out the right way to charge, whether it's one-time, subscription, freemium, etc. It's hard to give advice based on the limited info in your post.",

If you\u2019re running a negative margin business and you scale, guess what\u2019s gonna happen? You\u2019re going to scale your negative margin too!\n\nThis might be okay if you have some sort of network effect. If you do and there\u2019s even a remotely clear path to monetization then go raise. It\u2019s a tough market but if you have traction and can demonstrate healthy retention for a few weeks/months, you can absolutely raise. Being copyable does not matter usually if you have a network effect. If you don\u2019t\u2014 good luck. It\u2019s really hard to determine these things without knowing what your product is/the dynamics of it.\n\nSadly it is often the case that there are some products that just aren\u2019t able to monetize. If you think ads are your only way to monetization, I\u2019d likely place your idea/website in this bucket. It\u2019s okay, you learned you know how to get users. That\u2019s further than 90% of people get. Don\u2019t strain your brain trying to come up with a diabolical plan to monetize, they almost never work. Just pivot and take your lessons to the next product.",

In hindsight, it would have been better to figure out monetization because it is indeed much harder to have users pay money than use a product for free. Happy to discuss more privately. \n\nThe general advice to use startup credits from hosting providers is best for where you\u2019re at imo. It buys you a year of time basically. Spin up a C Corp using Stripe Atlas and apply for credits through that.",

If I were in this situation, I would send out surveys prefaced with an honest description of the situation\u2014providing you have the email list.\n\nI would email something like: \"We're happy you're finding value in our product. We are now asking for your help in defining the future of \\[product/company name\\]. Please see the 1-3 min survey in this email and answer a few questions.\"  \nI would ask about what's most important to them, where they can see improvements, and if they would be willing to pay for this.  \n\n\nThis should at least provide clarity if you're going to move to paid, you might get a sense of customer attrition and how you can mitigate it going forward by creating something they will value even more than the current iteration.   \n\n\nHope this helps!",

FOCUS on 2-3 most important factors to move beyond the launch period. \n\nJust friendly advice.",

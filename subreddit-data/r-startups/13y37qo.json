    "postText": "Hey Guys,\n\nI need some help, I'm working on this as a side project and could use some advice or guidance right now. We are building an API-first service for travel agents where they can extend credit to their customers via us. Now something that I can't quite figure out yet is how to map the customer journey in this case, all the fintech apps that revolve around lending &amp; payments have a pretty straightforward customer journey and there are tons of examples available. However, there are little to no resources (that I found) that help you develop a customer journey around an embedded finance product.\n\nAny pointers on how to proceed or if someone can guide me to those resources it would be of great help.\n\nOnce again thanks and cheers!",

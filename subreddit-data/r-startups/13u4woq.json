    "postText": "Basically as the title says. \n\nI left a really cushy corporate gig to go work at this really promising startup. I was promised the stars and sky. The founder and I really jived, so I thought, and I really emotionally invested myself into the role. \n\nThe product had many parts of it that were being demo\u2019d as a figma but I had to present it as if it was still very real. I had in that 40 days held 12 different meetings and even managed to get 3 meetings into case building. \n\nThese are very long sales cycles and I was selling MM with contract values over 50K+ for 1 year contracts. Not at all fast sales but works in progress. \n\nThe company itself had only acquired 19 customers in 3 years. Like, I really was giving it my best. \n\nI got the news I was being terminated with no severance with a shitty \u201cnot a cultural fit\u201d reason. So I guess there wasn\u2019t alignment on expectations? I really don\u2019t know. \n\nI feel devastated and betrayed. I emotionally poured myself into this role and just feel so heartbroken. \n\nI know i am competent in my job but this came at probably the worst possible time. My personal burnrate is ridiculous and my bank account is running on fumes. \n\nI\u2019ve been in sales for close to 15 years. Worked 100% commission roles where I was part of the top 1% of the company, invited to presidents club 3X. #1 in my market nearly 4 years in a row. \n\nWorked at one series A startup where I helped close 137K in one quarter, generating over 400K in pipeline all outbound. \n\nI burned the bridge of the corporate role when I left to serve that startup, so couldn\u2019t get my old job back if I tried. \n\nI\u2019m not asking for charity or a handout but I really could use help getting an introduction if anyone here knows a startup looking for an AE. \n\nI want to help build and grow the GTM engine. I need help and can\u2019t do it on my own. \n\nThanks for reading.",

            "comment": "If the company acquired only 19 customers in 3 years, it should ring alarm bells. Unless they were super high ticket, it just shows that the product doesn't have PMF. When you don't have PMF, selling is hard. Infact, it's not worth using that time on an uphill battle over longterm. It's probably good that you got out.\n\nIf I were you, I'd focus on joining a bit later stage company that has strong traction, especially given the current economic climate. Which domain are you in?",

Forgive me for possibly coming across glib here - but startups are inherently risky so I\u2019m not sure if it will solve your immediate cash flow issues. I\u2019m wondering if a midsize company\u2026possibly P/E backed or something\u2026would be a better option. More of an established offering with known OTE etc. And in a P/E type situation you\u2019ll likely still have a chance to make major impacts to GTM / growth strategy. A startup that is in the beginning stages of building out GTM seems like a coin toss to me, where you may end up in a worse situation. \n\nA couple thoughts though - if you\u2019re definitely pursuing a startup, I may try reaching out to VCs backing tech companies you think you can sell\u2026at minimum you may be able to get on their radar. Or you can always try contacting founders directly. If you decide to explore the private equity backed route, most of them have a VP of Talent or whatever for their portfolio companies. I\u2019d try connecting with them. Good luck!",

I spoke with 4 members of their team, 6 different interviews, and spoke with 3 ex-employees. I did as much investigating into the product and company as I possibly could. My VP that I followed was fired shortly after I was brought on and I was let go after him. \n\nYour assumptions are thoughtless and unnecessary. No need to be so antagonistic because you want to draw presumptuous conclusions that you don\u2019t know the full story to.",

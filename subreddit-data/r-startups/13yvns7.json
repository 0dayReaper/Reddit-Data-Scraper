    "postText": "Hello! I'm looking for a source for periodic info on startups that receive funding. I'd like the following information: name, website, brief product description, city, state, round (seed, series A, etc.), and amount raised. I'm mostly interested in US companies with B2B SaaS offerings. I know that I can scrape sites like [FormDs.com](https://FormDs.com), but that site doesn't include product information. I also know that I can get the information I want with a paid subscription to [Crunchbase.com](https://Crunchbase.com), but I'd like to find a free source.  Any ideas?",

My training only goes up until September 2021, so I don't have information on recent seed stage B2B SaaS fundings that have occurred since then. It's best to refer to financial news websites, venture capital databases, or industry publications for the most current information on funding rounds in the B2B SaaS space.\u201d",

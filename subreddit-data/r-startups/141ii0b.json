    "postText": "Hi everyone,  \n\n\nI know my question is a bit weird: I can't clearly explain our value proposition despite the fact that we've had great traction and dozens of regular paying customers for a few months now.\n\nIn a nutshell: we've developed a service that brings together and standardizes the multitude of AI services available via API (OpenAI, Google, AWS, DeepL, etc.), giving users all the flexibility they need to switch providers and always have the cost/performance ratio that suits them. I'll stop there for the presentation (just so you understand the context).\n\nSo far, we've had a very \"engineering\" approach, developing a service we think is cool and useful for developers. We raised a first round of financing (pre-seed) but only with business angels (mostly engineers) who liked the product and didn't ask too many questions.\n\nBut now that we're soon to raise a seed round with a VC, we're being asked to \"clarify\" our \"value proposition\", and that's where it gets tricky. When we talk to our users, they just list the features they like: reliable API, ready-to-use connectors (Zapier, Bubble, etc.), the ability to switch providers whenever they want, use more than one, freely add new AI services, and so on. But nothing that makes it a real value proposition.\n\nHow would you go about clarifying that? What's the right method?\n\nBest,",

            "comment": "- you solve the problem, that a developer doesn't have to search for the current state of the art. Because now they can just use your API and it will be the like a label. If it is listed on your website the product is verified.\n\n- they don't have to decide for one technology and later regret the decision. Because now they can always go back. They don't have to read multiple documentations. Discuss which is the best. Study the concept. They can just try it. I had the problem with text-to-speech. First I used company1 tts. But then I like company2 tts more. But it was so hard to change everything again. I had to read their documentation.\n\nI think if you show the pain points users have without your product and the benefits they have with your product, it is a good start for a value proposition.",

They can also use it to determine what they need and if they're overlapping investments.\n\nThe difference between time and time-to-market:\n\nBy Time, I mean the time savings developers can recoup because they're not searching and discovering new tools. Also, because you're offering essentially a \"high level\" API to other services, devs can reduce the time they spend retooling their code. Time to Market means that they can get their apps out faster, utilize the newest frameworks you're offering, and introduce new features to their offerings. That's incredibly valuable from a competitive angle.",

My hot take is that it\u2019s something like - gives developers control of the growing AI service landscape to accelerate time to market. \n\nAs a side note, I might checkout Segment\u2019s earlier pitch deck etc to see if there is any good language to recycle. This reminds me a bit of their early days (after pivot)",

We offer seamless integration with various leading AI services and easy-to-use connectors, saving our clients up to 30% of their time on integration efforts. With our reliable API, customers have the flexibility to switch or add providers whenever they want, ensuring they always have the best cost-performance ratio. This gives our clients an unmatched level of control and flexibility that they cannot get elsewhere.\"\n\nI dont know where the 30% came from but figure out how long it took customers to integrate your service and compare it to doing it themselves with like 1 or 2 providers.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I was putting this on a pitch deck I'd highlight:\n\n1)  Save development time by providing a standard connector for different services\n\n\\-Find out how much time you're saving customers\n\n2) Provider flexibility, easily test different solution providers from a common interface to get the best results for each use case\n\n\\-Find out what the spread of different actual usage your customers have for different providers\n\n\\--X% of customers use A, Y% of customers perfer B\n\n\\--X% of customers use more than one provider\n\n3) Cost management, allow developers to optimize their usage costs by arbitraging between different providers\n\n\\-Use a customer case study on how much they saved by switching providers (this can also help when you need to figure out your pricing model)\n\n4) Fast changeovers, allow developers to keep up with rapid advances in the ecosystem by rapidly changing to the best provider\n\n\\-Find out how often your customers switched primary providers",

Or we help \\[Y\\] do \\[X\\] by doing \\[Z\\]\n\nThese are the three things you need to figure out, then you can put them together to make a value proposition.\n\nIt sounds like you've got \\[Z\\] sorted: \"We consolidate API-based AI software\" could be a nice enough summary of the product.\n\nNext, you need to get to your target customer. It sounds like you have good communication channels with your customers \u2014 that's great. Who are these customers? What are their job titles? What size companies do they work for? What problems do they have that your product solves? Why would they choose you over competitors? Why might other potential customers not choose you?\n\nWhen analysing your user base, it's often a good idea to differentiate between your standard users and your \"super users\" (to use a horrible term) \u2014 the people who really love your product. What specific characteristics do your most enthusiastic users have?\n\nWrite out everything you know about your customers. Don't worry about it being snappy or concise. Just get all your thoughts down. And write it in plain English, like you'd explain it to a friend. Don't try and make it sound marketing-y.\n\nWhen you understand who this product is for, you've got \\[Y\\] sorted.\n\n\\[X\\] is all about the *benefit* of your product, as opposed to its *features.* This is a standard copywriting technique, the idea being that customers don't actually care about your product \u2014 they care about the problems it can solve for them.\n\nFor example, a *feature* of a pair of headphones might be that they're wireless. The *benefit* is that you don't have to worry about tangled headphone cords.\n\nWriting about benefits rather than features is essentially about looking at your product from the customer's point of view. (It's worth noting that your users often can't tell you what problem you solve \u2014 they've become used to thinking about product features too.)\n\nIt sounds like you're pretty close to this, too, when you talk about the customers having \"the cost/performance ratio that suits them\". That's your \\[X\\] \u2014 maximising the value of your customer's API-based AI subscriptions.\n\nSo you just need to put the elements together. A (pretty terrible) example might be \"We \\[help engineering managers at enterprise-level companies\\] \\[maximise the value of their AI software\\] by \\[consolidating their APIs\\].\n\nYou'll obviously know the actual X's, Y's and Z's better than I will, but this framework might help you formalise it in an investor-friendly way. Feel free to DM if you'd like to talk about it further \u2014 seems like an interesting challenge.",

I believe you already have a decent user base, but without a clear value proposition, it can be challenging to identify target users and channels. This can hinder your go-to-market and commercialization efforts, which is also a concern for investors. My suggestions are as follows:  \n1. Study your competitors: Identify the differences between your product and your competitors, and highlight your unique advantages.  \n2. Build showcases: Showcases allow users to quickly understand your capabilities and scope. It helps them gain a better understanding of your offering.",

    "postText": "This will most likely get removed since I'm basically venting, but I feel it's better than keeping all these thoughts bottled up.\n\nMe [25M] and my friend [26M] have known eachother since we were 9. For years we would constantly talk about the company we would start and got really interested in business in our early teenage years.\n\nLong story short, I majored in software engineering and he majored in psychology. He's from a pretty well-off family. Lives in a house his parents bought for him, no student loans, drives an Audi his parents bought him, doesn't have to pay his credit card bill, etc.\n\nAnyways, after graduation, I wanted to start paying off my loans as quickly as possible, so I got a fancy tech consulting job, which I've been in for the last 3 years, with about 30% of my loans paid. But my #1 goal has always been to either work for an early stage startup or be a part of its founding team. \n\nMy friend wanted to jump into either founding or working for a startup as soon as he graduated. And I can't really blame him since he basically had (and still has) almost no financial commitments whatsoever. \n\nAbout 2 years ago, he introduced me to someone he met at a networking event with the proposal of being cofounders together and with me as CTO working remotely from the new city I moved to for work. I was so excited, but was in no position to quit my current job.\n\nBasically what happened is I dedicated another 30 hrs per week to working on the startup idea, and it was too much. I didn't have time to properly refine the product and I'm sad to admit my work was rather subpar. It was also pretty stressful managing both jobs. Whereas my friend and our other cofounder were kicking ass presenting our idea at accelerator events. \n\nTo quickly wrap up the story, I had to leave because of the overwhelming workload, and wasn't able to adequately finish the product. I think this made an impression on our other cofounder since we never got funding or much traction.\n\nFast forward 2 yrs later, my friend and our other former cofounder started a different company in health tech, and hired an Ivy League graduate with internship experience at FAANG to be CTO. My friend's dad supplied $50k in initial funding. They currently have tons of customers, multiple VC offers, and are on track for a multi-million dollar valuation.\n\nI am happy for my friend, truly. It's what we always dreamed of. But I'd be lying if I didn't say I was jealous. When we talk, he tells me how he feels like he's in The Social Network. He's flying to events, getting invited to speak at places, gaining the respect of people in the industry. I have not seen or heard from our other cofounder in 2 yrs. \n\nThen there's me. I'm grateful I have a high-paying job, but my life is pretty unexciting otherwise. I've been trying to go to more networking events, but I feel like I don't have much to offer beyond my current job experience and general startup knowledge I've gained from reading and listening to other founders. So I've been trying to build out personal projects in my free time. \n\nI've also been focusing a lot on preparing for interviews at large tech companies or unicorns in the hopes of having something eye-popping on my resume that other co-founders might want to seek me out for. But I've sadly had lots of trouble making it through tech interviews. \n\nI've got lots of cool ideas and things I'd love to try and build. I'm just trying my hardest to curate my dream the same way my friend is seemly already fufilling his. He had a leg up on me after graduation, yes. But looking back I sometimes feel that I'm just not trying hard enough, or that I'm not meant to be a technical cofounder.\n\nOkay, I'm done. Going to go bake cookies and simmer down for a bit.",

Obviously most leadership courses teach you how to manage your followers but this one was different. He made it a point that you can only lead others if you can lead yourself. One of the most important lessons he imparted was regarding the idea of \"distinction\". Yes its easy to distinguish yourself from others, either to make you feel good about being better or make you feel like crap about being worse. But it's actually more like golf. Yes they are generally \"competing\" with each other but at the end of the day, golf is truly about being better than your past self. By comparing and measuring progress by seeing how you can be better compared to only yourself. Don't look at others, just focus on yourself and the rest will follow. How crappy would it be if your hero, perhaps a tennis player or a concert pianist, always remarked on how much they're better than the next guy. But if they were humble and only focused on how they performed in regards to only their part performances, that would speak volumes.",

It\u2019s such a poisonous emotion because, at the end of the day, you\u2019re no better off with jealousy. You\u2019re unhappier, and the person you\u2019re jealous of is still successful or good-looking or whatever they are. One day, I realized with all these people I was jealous of, I couldn\u2019t just choose little aspects of their life. I couldn\u2019t say I want his body, I want her money, I want his personality. You have to be that person. Do you want to actually be that person with all of their reactions, their desires, their family, their happiness level, their outlook on life, their self-image? If you\u2019re not willing to do a wholesale, 24/7, 100 percent swap with who that person is, then there is no point in being jealous. Once I came to that realization, jealousy faded away because I don\u2019t want to be anybody else. I\u2019m perfectly happy being me. By the way, even that is under my control. To be happy being me. It\u2019s just there are no social rewards for it. [4]\n\n- Naval Ravikant\n\nAsk yourself the above.\nRemember, you being jealous is only harming yourself. It isn't easy but try and focus and redirect that into yourself for a net gain. That will involve accepting you may never reach their level of success but that's your interpretation of success. Also, we never really know the contentment one has with their perceived external markers of success. We may see someone with a  fancy car and house and a successful company but we can never know how content and at peace they are in life.\n\nGratitude and looking at those with less is key here, not from a snobbery perspective but from a remembering what you have good in life. \n\nWe have limbs and our senses and hopefully health and many are born with this but because we didn't work for it, we don't perhaps deliberately value these as much.\n\nI could go on and what you're feeling is natural. He'll, I've felt it but I can only focus on chipping away at my own destiny.",

Your friend didn\u2019t choose to be born into a well off family, and you also didn\u2019t choose to be in the situation you were born into.  \n\nHaving said that\u2026 at the risk of being tarred and feathered, I\u2019ll stir the pot and provide another tougher perspective on this compared to the other comments.  \n\nYou should also recognize that you were risk averse.  You didn\u2019t go all in when you had the chance - yes you had reasons, but your objective function was a choice.  Startups nowadays pay effectively market rates (happy to debate this point if folks disagree) - so even though you would\u2019ve been in a higher risk situation, you could have made the leap at some point earlier too.\n\nI say this not to throw a jab, but it genuinely comes from a place of empowerment - as entrepreneurs and humans in general, I genuinely believe we\u2019re mostly limited by what we THINK we can do\u2026 not what we actually can.\n\nEither way, this will all be a distant memory when they interview you for the documentary of how you started a $10B company \ud83d\ude01",

Your buddy wasn\u2019t afraid of falling on his face, and you were. The thing is, if you have such a good tech job then you could be a less stellar employee and dedicate every waking moment that you\u2019re not working (at your job), sleeping, eating, or spending time with your spouse to building things, struggling, failing, over and over again. Because it\u2019ll likely take you years to figure out what you\u2019re doing it, and how you\u2019re doing it. Frankly, most people simply don\u2019t want it bad enough.\n\nI didn\u2019t either, not until just this year. But something finally changed for me which has made me obsessed with getting a successful startup going. It was probably turning 45, realizing I\u2019d been working in Corporate America for 12 years, with another 25 until retirement\u2014if I was lucky. That thought was like awww hell no. So even though I\u2019ve got a wife and three little kids and recently got laid off from my tech job, I\u2019m not giving up. Sure I\u2019m looking for a stopgap job, because we\u2019re not making any money yet, but I\u2019m also continuing to build the startup. So yeah, I\u2019m running flat out all day every day because there\u2019s so much to do and learn, and I need to fail faster.\n\nIn any case, just own where you\u2019re at, and stop making excuses.

He was everywhere on news and TV. I wanted to be just like him. I wanted the success that he had. I started my own business that was a copy cat of his, took a few of his founding members to my business and did it well. For the first year was a huge success, just like his. But I lacked of management skills and knowledges (as I was not prepared to do a business) and my business failed on the second year.\n\nThis was 7 years ago. The person that I was jealous of, turned out to be a no-one who just parties everyday. He got caught up in that moment of just enjoying his life, and making no progress. His business closed down, not because it failed, because he purely didn\u2019t want to work on it anymore. \n\nOn the other side, I\u2019m still growing. Eager to learn more everyday, starting again from the beginning, but with a solid background, experience and knowledge.\n\nI\u2019ve learnt that business can bring you a success, but in order to retain if, you need to be the successful person. Successful person is someone who does not stay at where they are, wanting to take more and keep on moving.\n\nLife is long. It\u2019s like a roller coaster.

There is no right time or right brands on the resume to start. \n\nI spent a few years in corporate to clear out my loans before I jumped into a startup. \n\nWhen you decide to startup, you will realise that building a business is hard no matter the privilege.

Wealthy families. Never had debt. Parents bought them houses. Seemed so carefree to me and like everything in their life was so easy and they must be so much happier than me. Meanwhile I've had to work for everything I have and realise I will probably never get anywhere near the wealth they have. \n\nWhat I've come to realise for each of them is that they're never quite satisfied. Because they never work for things they don't appreciate them and they tire quickly. They just don't seem to truly enjoy anything. And they now all seem bored with their lives. My brother in law constantly starts studying new courses his dad pays for or new jobs or hobbies and he quits them all because he doesn't have that 'work to survive' drive so he gives up. He doesn't really value the nice cars or expensive watches his dad buys him as he never worked for them. I see it getting worse as he gets older. \n\nI guess what I am trying to say, is there is value in the position and experiences you have. Value your friend won't ever get to know. It might not feel that way now, but this is all shaping your drive and motivation and your ability to gain genuine joy and satisfaction from your achievements. You will get there. You seem like an awesome guy and you're clearly very smart. You'll get there and you will be weaponised in ways only possible because of your circumstances.",

Don't compare yourself to your friend from a different background.  Compare yourself to other people your age from the same background to yours. When you look at people, perhaps from your high school from the same social class, would you call yourself successful compared to them or not?",

It\u2019s never too late and everyone\u2019s path is different! Just focus on building a stable base so you can give it a good shot when the time comes, and not feel pressured back into a steady paycheck too soon.\n\nMost successful founders are older despite the narrative and you work a hell of a lot smarter with some life experience under your belt. \n\nThere are many paths up the mountain \ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f",

It's a miracle you were even able to even work an extra 30 hours a week. Seriously, don't lose faith in your potential because of some lousy tech interviews - personally, I think those are a load of crap, no one knows how to seek the ideal person for the job but everyone pretends like they know just what they want to. And the candidates fooling them are no better...it's become a self-fulfilling toxic circle IMO. But that's a topic for a different post.\n\nSecondly, a co-founder is not a person you interview, it's usually someone you know already and deeply trust. I think you may be looking for a co-founder at the wrong place, but do elaborate if I'm wrong at this.\n\nThe way I see it is - why would anyone go out of their way to seek you out for a dream you yourself have? Stars won't magically align because \"you deserve it\" to happen. Just like everyone else, you're living a unique life with things you can and can't control.\n\nAnd with that last sentence in mind, remember you are still in your 20s. You're a time billionaire. Seriously, something like 2 billion seconds with a bit of luck. I don't see why you couldn't launch your own startup. Or two...whatever your dreams are. Don't let the past hold you back, and don't look at money, cars and fame as a measure of a fulfilled life. What the f\\* does your friend's Audi have to do with your future? You ought to rethink what makes a person valuable.\n\nWork on self-improvement, like being kinder to others without expecting anything in return, and as the eternal truth goes; what goes around comes around. Just have a little faith and stay true to yourself - the worst thing that could happen is the feeling that nothing is ever enough. You've got many great things others can only dream of right now. Cherish that!",

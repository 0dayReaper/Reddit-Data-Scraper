I sold out early (potentially could have made x10 later) when VCs came knocking, didn\u2019t regret it then or later when the company folded (sad to see it happen regardless).",

That might not be the type of business you are trying to build, and that's just fine.",

There are times in which VCs are an invaluable resource, ally, and partner in your vision. I have had great experiences with VCs, and I have had poor ones. Most of the time it was either because we had aligned, or misaligned incentives.\n\nGo start building something and when you need to execute a strategy, remember the choice is always yours.

I have seen posts from all sorts of businesses , some are obviously not a fit for professional investors, whilst some may. But for a founder, bringing a VC is a pact with the devil: they will seek liquidity over a short term horizon and their business model is to look for hyper growth at all costs. If you can't bootstrap, glory to you. Else I would advocate to try and stick with angel money for as long as you can, and seek family offices, some of whom may provide more patient capital.",

If you have competition that is also racing for initial market capture, a VC will help you accelerate it which could be the deciding factor of success especially in industries where there are limited long term contracts. If your business requires more capital than you have to get past an important inflection point, a VC can help you as well. If you got a massive order where you don't get paid before delivery and can't afford manufacturing costs, a VC might be your only option if you don't have collateral for a business loan. If you need specialized connections that the VC has and you don't, bringing them in could be a hugely beneficial resource.\n\nThat said, yeah, if you don't need cash to continue growing, and don't care to grow faster than you are, why bring another liability into the mix? They might be able to help you make more money in the long run, but I wouldn't force it either, personally. Bringing in a VC adds extra steps to decision making and likely some extra reporting overhead which isn't usually the best thing for a small company. If you want to remain small and growing at a slower pace, the VC will end up forcing you to change your mind which might not be the right choice for your personal mental health.",

Sometimes a war chest is an advantage, sometimes it\u2019s a burden. There\u2019s plenty of Silicon Valley companies that have done very well and limited their reliance on outside capital. Some areas it simply doesn\u2019t make sense. If you have organic growth and are holding up fine, capital might not do anything for you. Ironically the most capital efficient businesses need VC the least. The best situation is when you are growing, could have use for capital, but don\u2019t need it. You have all the leverage in the world then. I\u2019ve seen so many founders raise and have no idea what to do with the money (I\u2019ve been guilty of this myself).

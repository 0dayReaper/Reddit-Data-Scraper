Do some email marketing.  \nBasically, it adds nothing to the user experience of the game.  \nBut if all goes well and I'll try to sell this app, will the buyer be interested in this? Will it add substantial value to the app? \ud83e\udd14",

            "comment": "Probably not. Downloads/subscriptions numbers over time will be more meaningful data to provide to investors/buyers. Additionally, if you have ad revenue, you might want to show A/B data regarding the frequency of ads vs frequency of engagement if your game is freemium. As a gamer, I like mobile games casually like if I'm a passenger or just waiting for something; I routinely start playing a game and if the ad-frequency (or cost to remove) is too much wind up deleting it. Not sure if I'm typical, but it's worth considering.\n\nSpeaking as a systems &amp; software engineer with 15 years of experience, you should consider linking the app to a SSO service like Google, Apple, and others. The last thing you want is some kind of data-breach that **YOU OR YOUR BUSINESS** would be liable for. I don't know what costs are to integrate that (I'll be finding that out later myself), but I imagine it wouldn't be costly. I know others have tied that together with opt-in/out newsletter campaigns to help drum-up word-of-mouth marketing. So I'd consider looking into that too.",

If you promised a free gift card after signing up, the list is most likely worthless. If it was after reading some posts about your app, it probably has more value. In theory it's simple, the conversation rate of the list and lifetime value of the customer.",

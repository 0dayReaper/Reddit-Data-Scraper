    "postText": "I'm pretty sure this is common topic here, but i don't who to talk about this. I'm in terrible physical, mental and spiritual pain. I joined this startup a year ago, fresh out of college. I'm a data scientist but im doing all sorts of stuff (data engineering, dev ops, backend engineering, hell i even write some mailchimp templates and have designed Figma boards). At first i was super excited and motivated, i was learning like crazy. Every day there was a new thing and i loved it. Now we have a beta version of the product and the hours are crazy. My boss pings me at anytime, doesnt matter how early or late it is. At first i didnt mind it. Im single, live on my own so i can afford to spend work crazy hours.\n\n  \nRIght now i cant. I cant seem to finish my tasks anymore. My jira tickets keep dragging forever. My Epics never finish. I just cant focus anymore. Im not happy and i lost my desire to program. Everyday i dream about going back to my old jobs (waiter and landscapper). The people were 100x funnier and cooler, the jobs were hard but cool. Right now, all my coworkers talk about math and CS stuff ALL DAY LONG. Nothing else.Slack has given me PTSD. Everytime i get a Slack notification, my anxiety jumps like crazy. I feel underappreciated and underpaid. I have no motivation to work anymore, and deep down im just waiting to get fired. Furthermore, I dont want to give up but my soul has. My will and discipline are the only ones who are keeping me going. Every night i cry like a bitch. The Chief Data Scientist is my supervisor and the main person who develops the models. Im the one who implements them and makes ETLs out of them The models are shit and i keep getting all the heat.\n\n  \nEverybody is either a Phd or Masters, im the only one with just an undergrad. Im the worst person in the company and im pretty sure the only reason why im not fired yet is due to my determination and not giving up BUT DAMN IF NOT THE WORST PERSON.  \nIdk what to do man. I want to give up but i cant. I want to get better but i cant.  \nSrry for the grammar, im going nuts.  \n",

Get good at estimating your bandwidth for work that you can deliver and still maintain your satisfaction at work. Don't take on projects that exceed that bandwidth. If Slack messages are stressing you out set the expectation that you'll only respond to them within your communicated working hours. Every job has \"crunch time\", but it's not possible for a person to function effectively if it happens year round.\n\nMost bosses would rather see you do well at a smaller number of things consistently than for you to say yes to everything they throw at you, burn yourself out and deliver subpar work. If your company isn't a place like this you can just as easily find one that is.",

I would prefer to excel at one sphere.\"\n\nPeople who say \"quit\" are pussies. You don't need to quit, you need to stand your ground and tell them. Yeah it's a a startup and start-ups are chaotic, but if you put some structure in that chaos you will be rewarded for it - I guarantee you.\n\nHere's some actions you can take:\n\nSet meeting with boss 1:1 in person if possible.\n\nTell him what I said, prepare this, prepare his arguments \"you new, we startup, blah blah blah\"\n\nGo into that meeting with goal to get the changes tomorrow, not after a year or stupid amount of time.\n\nBe ready to quit, but don't just quit - get fired. If your boss isn't willing to do these things, do them anyways, until they either fire you or you fins another job in the process.\n\n\nI had exactly same thing happen to me, went to my boss told him my boundaries, he said ok, let's change that in a month. I waited a month, nothing changed, went to him, he said another month. So instead of waiting the same day, my work time finished I turned off my phone and same thing next day and day after that. I replied only in my work hours and actually no one was mad, they got used to it in a week. I completely rehauled my job, only did what was related to my position and stress was gone. Year later I was promoted for doing great work.\n\nYou are probably young, so you need to learn set boundaries in work, relationships, friendships and everywhere in life.",

It is very rare to receive options that vest immediately, and I feel comfortable saying they are never given as part of regular comp packages. \n\n&gt; If the EV of the stock is close to 0 pre or during Series A, isnt that good.\n\nI mean the EV of the payout that you personally will get from working at a series A company that offers stock options is close to $0. Working at a pre Series B company as a non founder is statistically a really bad investment. I would only tell people to work at one if they get personal satisfaction from doing so.

I've worked for and with people who seem to think that this is OK. \n\nThen, to add icing on the cake; they often are calling to switch directions or make stupid changes.\n\nFour common examples would be:\n\n* There are 5 key basic features needed to make the product work. Things like being able to log in. But suddenly a 10pm call seems needed to start fiddling with the placeholder icons I put in place. Which is a higher priority, getting the product out this week and then make changes, or start making endless changes resulting in the product arriving no less than a month from now?\n\n* Starting to ask for things for the next product. Like literally a product which won't exist or start work for a month or two. But let's kill a deadline to get the project management going on the new product, because it is more exciting than the present one.\n\n* Entire massive distractions. Let's make a presentation which will take 3 days and stop work on a product which really needs to be out in the next 48 hours.\n\n* Let's call repeatedly to find out why the product isn't ready yet. These aren't 5 minute phone calls which would be distracting enough, but really long calls which can literally kill productivity for the day. Then, to make these calls even worse when they come in the middle of the day and I'm desperately trying to keep my flow, the sudden imaginary deadline will be proposed. So I just say, yeah yeah, not a problem; as I try to get back to work. Then suddenly I've promised to make a deadline which is entirely impossible. Maybe I give it my all and make the deadline, only to find out the meeting which was \"set in stone\" wasn't ever agreed to by the other party which is both a relief but now I just spent 3 18 hour days getting shit code done. This not only is going to take time to clean up, but now I need time to recover.\n\nSo, yes, I feel your pain, except where you have shitty people scapegoating you, that just makes it all worse.\n\nA common suggestion will be \"Learn to set boundaries.\" What I find is that people who do the above just don't understand boundaries. I've found a certain class of semi-successful person has turned pestering into such an art form that it produces some success.  If you find a way to set boundaries with people like this, please tell me how.\n\nThe only formula I've found is a combination of cutting such people out of my life. The other formula I discovered is having two entirely different sets of contact technologies. \n\nI have one phone number and email which I give out. A different email (and the previous phone number) which I give to corporations and whatnot who I have a relationship with; I have a limited social media on this as well. I keep these on an old phone which sits in a drawer. I then have my \"real\" phone which very few people have along with my real email, and some social media. \n\nI check my old phone every few days. \n\nI've been experimenting with a voip system where I can give out a number (which I gave to my mother) and if she phones it forwards to my good phone. But if anyone else phones that number it plays a long compendium of R2D2 noises on a loop. My mother writes numbers down and my family has access to this. When they call it is primarily for tech support; hence my not giving them my good number or email.\n\nLong story short, the only way I've managed to set boundaries is to build giant walls.",

Maybe some mental advice: NEVER tie your self worth to work/achievements, try to base it off your own growth and the relationships with the people you love. \n\nMan, I am following a CS master, I would not know many of the practical things you learnt so far. I have no clue how to work with figma, mailchimp or build/integrate anything other than 4 week small coding projects for university. Don't underestimate doers like yourself when paired against theoretical people.",

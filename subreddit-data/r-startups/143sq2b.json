    "postText": "I\u2019m currently working in a late Seed stage startup as a  Product lead. Everything was great for months, until the Founder (who manages me) went through something extremely traumatic in his life. Despite my role in product, I work closely with the founder on all things fundraising, ops, sales, GTM. \n\nWe\u2019re only a small team of only 4 people (including the Founder and myself) so it\u2019s naturally expected that we were supposed to wear many different hats and perform multiple responsibilities outside of our job scope. \n\nThat\u2019s fine - but the company has been known to have a high turnover. We had someone join recently and leave within 1.5 months. The workload is bordering on abnormal - I\u2019ve worked in seed stage startups extensively in my career and I\u2019d like to think I have a good gauge of how hectic things can be and what to expect. \n\nBut no. We work 80-90 hours week (sometimes even weekends), no lunch breaks, work gets constantly pushed and offloaded onto me, Founder constantly sends emails and slack messages at ungodly hours of the night (12am, 11pm, 2am). There\u2019s absolutely no work-life balance. Founder is passive aggressive and once made highly personal comments to me that I felt was wholly unprofessional, plays the blame game and switched between providing no direction and suddenly micro-managing on one day. \n\nI\u2019m pretty much expected to take on responsibilities as a \u201cCo-founder\u201d for a much lesser pay and negligible equity stake. \n\nThe founder wouldn\u2019t be challenged or take data-driven suggestions from employees on how processes can be improved. DESPITE reiterating in their values that the team should be challenged. As a result, we\u2019ve been less and less productive and personally I\u2019m struggling with the workload and delivering objectives on time. \n\nThere\u2019s an overall clear lack of focus, bad culture (I know it\u2019s hard to build culture when scaling but surely a revolving door of people leaving is a clear indication something\u2019s amiss) and shambolic leadership. \n\nThe only time opinions are ever considered are the ones coming from our board. And members of our board have told the founder off multiple times on how his vision at times isn\u2019t grounded in reality. \n\nI guess I just wanted to know if this situation can ever be salvaged or should I simply walk away for good?",

Founder will rage and threaten to fire you, but he wont because he needs you even if you are at half the effort you were before. Workplace is toxic because the founder is toxic and you already know they wont change in any substantial way. Set boundaries and stick to them.\n\nEdit: The board should also be made aware of the founder\u2019s inability to create a positive and productive work environment and therefore the inability to retain key talent. I\u2019d argue they have a duty to fire him from the CEO role.",

I'd like to suggest some other options in case you decide to stay.\n\nFirst of all, how close is your relationship with the board? Do you speak in board meetings? Do you know them personally? Do you think they have a good opinion of you?\n\nThe reason I ask is that if the board and the founder are often arguing, it's in their interests to have more than one founder. Where I am going with this, if you're already doing co-founder level work, you might be able to renegoitate your equity package, and you might have quite a lot of leverage in this situation, especially if you have the board to argue with the founder on your behalf.\n\nAdditionally, get that founder a coach. Seriously, people are capable of growing a surprising amount, but they have to be put in the right situation at the right time, and have the right mindset. A coach can do this, but make sure it's someone who can call him out on his BS rather than enabling it.\n\nOf course, only do this if you want to. It sounds like a lot of work for a low expectation of reward, and I don't think this is possible without the founder at least partially acknowledging there's a problem, so that part is out of your hands. I also would only do this if you really strongly believe in the business.",

These include just being a considerate person who respects the data and market feedback. I know that may seem like a high bar in the startup world - but why should you or I settle for less? Especially when you are going to invest that much time and effort.\n\nAnyways I met a startup founder who seemed great. I was in the same boat as you - a generalist role where I helped with many things. I was helping with getting outbound b2b meetings and at this meeting the founder basically went nuts.\n\nThe data showed we received a 10% response rate to our pitches and conversion at 6% to meetings over a week. He wasn't happy with this progress. He went on to say he could do it in an hour himself and get as many meetings as he wanted.\n\nIt was at this point that I realized he wasn't grounded in reality and would not accept anything but his view.  This is very similar to what you stated about your situation.\n\nI stayed calm and told him that was not the data showed. He continued to deny the data. So I eventually told him that he should find someone else who could meet his standards. \n\nI concluded that this was not a person to work with as many more issues such as you have alluded to would come up. After the discussion continued to go nowhere I decided to end our working relationship. \n\nThis is just my experience. I feel like you have already made up your mind but just want confirmation from this group as well. Hopefully, some of what I have said will help you arrive at your own decision.",

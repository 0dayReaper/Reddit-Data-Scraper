    "postText": "Between a full-time job and two small kiddos, finding time to work on my start up is proving challenging. I\u2019m able to get in some hours at my current job because of the flexibility, but I know I can hammer away at nights when everyone\u2019s sleeping. The only problem is, come 9 o\u2019clock, I\u2019m pretty exhausted. after putting the kids to bed, making lunches, and cleaning up the house, I\u2019m pretty tired. Does anyone have any tips on how to squeeze an extra hour of productivity out at the end of the day? It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be something I do at 9, but just looking for some tips. I also want to try to avoid caffeine within a few hours before going to sleep.\n\nEdit: Thank you to all of those who have recommended water and diet; however, my water and diet is already dialed in. A side gig of mine is personal training and I have my degree in kinesiology, so those are priorities for me.",

I wake up at 4 and get the most productive, fresh, focused hours of work in. By the time my toddler wakes up, around 7-8, I\u2019ve already taken care of a ton of vital stuff with the best of me. Then the rest of the day I squeeze more stuff in as able, but it\u2019s the early morning work that pulls the real cart. \n\nBefore that though, I used to do what you do and tried to work at the end of the day always. Usually after my kid went to sleep, past 8. Does not compare at all. I promise. After the entire day you\u2019re just too worn down and it will not be the same. If your job start time enables you to (as in, you don\u2019t have to leave the house before 7) I recommend you give it a try. 4 wake up, stretch, light excediste to get you going, start work 4:10-6:30. Then shower, get ready, eat, prepare the kids, go to work or start the \u201cregular\u201d day. It\u2019s hard but I\u2019ve found the results to be incomparable. With the days it gets easier since you\u2019re getting full sleep. But you have to be strict with your bed time at 8 or MAX 9. \n\nYou\u2019re essentially doing the same, just switching late night work for sleep, and early morninh sleep for work. You have peace of mind the full day because you\u2019ve already worked with great focus, rather than that feeling of always being a step behind trying to grasp tasks and being exhausted like you describe.",

Try to exercise during the day, stay away from sugar and fast foods, make sure you get your vitamins, minerals, sunlight, and enough good quality sleep (I recommend getting an Apple Watch to keep track of that).\n\nPersonally I work well best on a steady diet with low GI and high in protein, and if I need to work late I make sure to eat enough early enough to not feel a need to do stupid food choices while working.",

Only 1 cup at 10pm though and 2 cups at 6am both times the coffee is black no cream or sugar as it makes me kinda feel sleepy if I use either.

So messing with your body clock will decrease your energy the next day.. but if you absolutely must do that then  testosterone boosting supplements ( i.e. ashwagandha) might help with concentration.. but again this is likely to.mess up with your body clock so best to sleep during night and then wake up earlier in the morning and do the work as you will be well alert!!",

Most people took Adderall, I thought I was too good for it. Fast forward 2 years and I can't stay awake.\n\nI started taking a prodrug to modafinil - moda is a a gentle wakefulness and nootropic. Talk to your doctor about it.\n\nI didn't do that though. I just bought a prodrug that your liver metabolizes at some ratio (armodafinil or similar).\n\nIt worked, and maybe it was in my head, but i thought I started having stomach / liver pains - you can't drink on it and I was 22.\n\nI decided to quit and find a job where I did meaningful work for 50 hours a week instead of 90 hours making up numbers.\n\nFor some real advice, cycle off of coffee for a few weeks - even one works. Drink green tea. The caffeine rush will come back.\n\nBut overall I recommend moda",

It has a shorter half life and as far as I can tell not very addictive. I believe much of the reason smoking is considered addictive is the act of smoking itself and associated dopamine from the rush of social interactions",

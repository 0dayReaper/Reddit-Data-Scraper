One common approach I've been told multiple times was create a landing page with an email signup and see if people are interested, if so, only then create the mvp. \n\nWhere are some of the places (communities) people go to get users to see if there is any traction.",

If no one signs up, then you know nobody wants it.\n\nIt is common for people to build products and after launching cannot get a single user.\n\nSome of them even spend large sums of money getting patents, trademarks, nda documents and hire people to build only to realize that nobody wants to use their product.",

            "comment": "I think the landing page with email is the most straight forward approach. People are picky about giving their email or joining stuff in general so if they at least sign up for that, it\u2019s a significant pointer imo. Obviously your landing page needs to be as closely accurate to your final product as possible (provide doable mockups/videos) so there\u2019s no disappointment for anyone including you. \n\nGo wherever your end users are. You should know before building anything who it\u2019s for and where they are so you can validate it with them. Find where they hang out and get the message to them.  \n\nThere\u2019s no specific communities people go to validate in general (like product hunt or such) because it\u2019s not where your user base will be at most likely. Just act as if you were already trying to get people into your MVP, but for email signup. Where are they? That\u2019s the real question you need to figure out. We can\u2019t tell you because we have no idea what you\u2019re making most likely. \n\nNot an expert but have a new small platform and in a similar process. What has worked for us is reaching out to users directly, posting online where they can see us, and getting sponsorships that help with exposure. That\u2019s how we\u2019ve gotten the best feedback (signup/no signup). Make sure to keep track of all your rates well! Good luck!!",

With some apps, like dating, there are so many of them out there that people know about them and you can just ask people what their thoughts are on them and what they don't like.  WIth other industries there is very few existing products so you really have to build something first to show people.  Also sometimes selling people value add can be a challenge.",

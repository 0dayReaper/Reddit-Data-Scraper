But often in early startups that means giving up valuable time to experiment market fit.\n\nSo we completely up ended out dev strategy to churn out fakeish demoable features that we can at least show off to the customer on sales calls before fully building out the whole feature.",

I have a small saas business that does a fair amount in MRR but growth was super slow at first, basically, all the customers came from direct sales through cold outreach. This was obviously super unscalable and was a very slow grindy way to get anything done. What started helping was I watched google trends, subscribed to [a newsletter](https://onbird.beehiiv.com/subscribe), looked at trending stuff on reddit to understand where the hype was. The product is a productivity tool that I won't shill here, but it was essential to establish myself as a person of knowledge in a space with a lot of people and sell into that market.",

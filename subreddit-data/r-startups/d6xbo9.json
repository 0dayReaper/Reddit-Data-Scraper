    "postText": "Every time I take part in a startup-oriented networking event/bootcamp/seminar/whatever there is always one stat popping up: around 90% of startups fail.\nThis usually leads A LOT of very talented people to an extremely pessimistic perspective on starting/working for a startup.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe that this dreadful 90% is inflated by the tremendous amount of \"startups\" revolving around apps or web services. These are definitely the more \"noob-friendly\" sectors and are also not particularly capital-intensive to start.\n\nSo pretty much everyone who has an \"original idea\" (and a great deal of lack of self awareness) joins the ranks of entrepreneurs and calls himself/herself CEO/Founder/King of the World.\n\nThe most baffling things I read (here on Reddit, but also around the web) are people surprised that their startup failed for lack of \"product-market fit\" (which btw is usually reported as the #1 cause of failure). Or, even worse, people trying to figure out solutions to imaginary problems (usually some corporate service bullshit or the N-th dating app/social network).\n\nThe world of actual startups is filled with incredibly interesting innovations that are drowned by the sheer quantity of crap that \"wantrepreneurs\" are putting out on a daily basis hoping to hit a lucky shot.\n\nNo one needs your stupid app, deal with it.\n\nSorry for the rant, just needed to get this off my chest",

FFW to graduating with his business degree, he could pursue a full time management position working for a restaurant. Learn FOH and BOH management responsibilities. After working management for 5 years, I would say a combined restaurant experience of 10 years coupled with a business degree would make him qualified to make the jump into restauranteurship.

It sounds like you\u2019re saying that hands on experience would be the best way to learn how to run a restaurant.\n\nIronically, I have managed a restaurant AND I have a business degree, but I\u2019m STILL not qualified to own/operate a restaurant.

A business degree can be transferable into a wide variety of industries. The key is being specialized in an industry, in this case, the restaurant industry.",

That leaves you with about 10-40 hrs/wk when you\u2019re sufficiently functional to do engineering work. To be very blunt, if you can\u2019t handle splitting your focus between a job and a side project for 60-80 hrs every week, then owning a business probably isn\u2019t your thing...\n\nRegarding the feasibility of an additional 10-40hrs if work, I\u2019m saying this from my own practical experience of completing a master\u2019s while working full time. My MS involved writing tens of thousands of lines of computational mechanics and dynamics code, as well as published research and a ~200 page thesis. Regarding 60-80 hr/wk being a requirement for business owners, my first gig out of college was engineering consulting for startups and my dad ran a fairly successful business for most of my life. Both my dad and the successful founders had one thing in common, despite working under radically different circumstances: they never turned off their work. They started working when they woke up at 6-7am, before ever leaving their home, and worked until 12-1am from home. Obviously this isn\u2019t totally necessary to fun a profitable, stable business. But it is unfortunately the name of the game if you\u2019re going to make a genuine effort to scale and make a mark in a fairly saturated business space.",

A team for a successful business is more than just software engineers, you have sales people, marketing people, a CEO etc.. Sometimes in a small startup people will wear multiple hats and be an engineer/marketing/sales person. But if they wear multiple hats, they need to be good at the other hats they are wearing. So having a good team is more than just having good engineers, you need good sales people too.  The idea can suck as long as your team is good and sales knows how to sell a crappy idea. I have seen lots of terrible products in the wild which get bought like crazy people sales and marketing teams are strong and sell clueless enterprise customers on an idea that they need to get their people \"Scrum Certified\" or whatever snake oil they are selling.",

The product just sold itself and the market amplified this with word of mouth of marketing and referrals.\n\n2nd opportunity Is what I call the branding opportunity\n\nUsually most markets are crowded with similar products/apps/Web services but there is no clear brand or market leader, in other words if you mentioned a problem people wouldn't readily associate a brand as the solution.\n\nSo for example, when it comes to search, Google is the association most people make with a Search Engine, so any startup that tries to reinvent search will likely fail because there is no BRANDING opportunity.\n\nBut how did Google get there? 1st was they took advantage of the PRODUCT opportunity.l, Google search engine results where far superior than the competition and with no marketing budget they became the dominant search engine in the world - yet no one has ever seen an advert to use Google search!\n\nNow here is the thing, it's easier, cheaper and sustainable to pursue the PRODUCT opportunity than the BRANDING opportunity, why?\n\nHistory and stats show companies that took advantage of the PRODUCT opportunity also got the BRANDING opportunity as a freebie, Google, Tesla, Apple iPhone (at first, with their keyboard less and appstore), blackberry (at a time when there was no smartphone for business executives) even Airbnb (hotels are always fully booked at peak times, and expensive so there was market dying for a product like theirs)\n\nA lot of pitchdecks I have read or come across on the Internet land focus more on the marketing opportunity and they tend to overestimate themselves and their product and underestimate the competition and challenges ahead.\n\nThats why the top top VCs look at traction - traction is a good signal for a product OPPORTUNITY, its not perfect but it's a good early signal that there is a market dying for such a product - this is the framework Peter Thiel used when gauging to invest in Facebook, there was no known tried and tested business model (zuckerburg still said it was just a telephone directory and not MySpace clone) but the traction was big! (Facebook was even being used in England, at Cambridge University and yet no one had marketed it)\n\nIf you are a startup or interested in starting a startup then focus on the product opportunity.\n\nLeave the branding opportunity to us marketers:-) sometimes those branding opportunitiew exist on social media (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook) or SEO etc. \n\nYou will notice Gary Vaynerchuk speaks a lot about the social media - that's because he is telling you to take advantage of the BRANDING opportunity available there.  Brands that come to mind are (Daniel Wellington, MVMT watches, Beats By Dre etc) - their products wherent world class or the best but there was no clear Brand association's in their respective industries. \n\nFirst pursue the product opportunity and then optimise and take advantage of the branding opportunity.",

The article argues it's a trend to IPO before profitability, not that Uber's S-1 is particularly bad.\n\nAs the article states, it's just a standard risk awareness clause:\n\n&gt;**We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, and **we may not achieve profitability**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We have incurred significant losses since inception. We incurred operating losses of $4.0 billion and $3.0 billion in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, and as of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $7.9 billion. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels and decrease proportionate expenses in future periods to achieve profitability in many of our largest markets, including in the United States, and even if we do, **we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability**. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the near term as a result of expected substantial increases in our operating expenses, as we continue to invest in order to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, restaurants, shippers, and carriers using our platform through incentives, discounts, and promotions; expand within existing or into new markets; increase our research and development expenses; invest in ATG and Other Technology Programs; expand marketing channels and operations; hire additional employees; and add new products and offerings to our platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increase revenue or contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products, such as UberPOOL, that we expect to add value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate. Further, we charge a lower service fee to certain of our largest chain restaurant partners on our Uber Eats offering to grow the number of Uber Eats consumers, which may at times result in a negative take rate with respect to those transactions after considering amounts collected from consumers and paid to Drivers. As we expand our offerings to additional cities, our offerings in these cities may be less profitable than the markets in which we currently operate. As such, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the near term or at all. Additionally, we may not realize the operating efficiencies we expect to achieve as a result of our acquisition of Careem and may continue to incur significant operating losses in the Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan in the future. Even if we do experience operating efficiencies, we do not expect improvements to our operating results, at least in the near term.",

Brian Chesky maxed out a binder of credit cards, and would go knocking door-to-door asking people to sign up. Kevin Systrom famously would go and set the home page of library computers to his little startup to try and drive hits/interest. And if you had met either of these entrepreneurs in the early stages, you would inevitably be lead to the same conclusion: No one needs your stupid app, deal with it.\n\nIf everyone harboured the same sentiment that you express here, we wouldn't have AirBNB or Instagram, or the NUMEROUS other starups that today feel so obviously great that it's incomprehensible how they could have ever been turned down for funding at any point. But the simple reality is for a long time, they were just someone's \"stupid app.\"\n\nSo who are you to say that someone's app is stupid? If anyone in the world had the ability to discern the 90% of failures from the 10% of successes, she would be the richest person on the planet. We NEED entrepreneurs to believe in their stupid app when no one else does, to believe that their app could make a meaningful change, and to continue believing when they meet people at networking events who politely smile when they explain their idea and when they get rejected from fundraising meeting after fundraising meeting.\n\nSo don't try to tell me that the businesses you're describing are different from the ones I'm talking about, because in the early stages especially, they're totally indistinguishable. We need more entrepreneurs to believe in themselves and their ideas, and most importantly, to believe in one another.\n\nEdit: Wasn't brief. Sorry.",

Sure a marketing company helps a company make more money, but it doesn\u2019t contribute to innovation, it actually takes away from it.",

If anything, I find those products a hell of a lot more attractive.\n\nIf you got the capital, partners, or connections to run a physical product idea into the market properly then go on your own.

The market potential is pretty big. \n\nI am based in the U.K. so YC co-founder platform may not work. And my 1st degree network is not suitable for this either. \n\nCould you please suggest some online and offline ways that worked for you?\n\nMany thanks! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

Keep doing what you're doing, in addition to reaching out to people on other platforms like LinkedIn or by attending founder meetups, of which there are many here in London, Bristol, Manchester etc\n\nI think you're doing the right thing by reaching out here. This subreddit and /r/cofounder are great communities and I'm sure you'll meet someone compatible in due course. \n\nThe reason I personally didn't engage with your proposition when I saw your post the other day is that I thought it was a crowded space where it's going to be prohibitively difficult to get initial traction, and where investors are unlikely to be generous in. It needs to solve a unique problem in a highly monetisable way for it to be successful. Not impossible, but *really* hard.\n\nGood luck out there \u270c\ufe0f",

Real money or $2k mrr?  5 visits / day in google analytics, or 10k daus?\n\nI'm skeptical because you're vague, and ime, people with actual traction aren't vague.\n\nAdditionally: why do you need or want a cofounder, ie someone hired primarily with equity, rather than a EM/DirE/VPE employee?  There's two alternatives here: either you don't have any real traction, or you don't understand what you need.  Either ain't great, and will be immediately understood by the candidates you want.\n\nRegardless: if you have real traction, say so.  Decide if you want a cofounder or an employee. \n Approach former startup founders or execs and say eg, \"We got to $25k mrr with an [outsourced team | locode | nocode] and are looking to build a team.  I'm looking for a [tech founder | VPE].\"",

Neither @xasdfxx nor I can tell better than you whether that\u2019s true for you, but I\u2019m sure we could both pontificarte on the myriad reasons a startup at any early stage could benefit from a cofounder (with or without traction). To @xasdfxx\u2019s point, if you don\u2019t **need** a cofounder it can certainly be better for you to hire instead. \n\nLots of good answers here for finding a cofounder if that\u2019s the path you choose. I found a remote cofounder (though eventually moving to my location) through LinkedIn, lots of ways to meet up in person or through local groups, and hiring if that\u2019s right can be done in many ways too. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t found any kind of mentor yet I highly recommend finding someone experienced in your field and location who can give good advice on this and other questions as they come up. \n\nBest of luck!",

You can always do the opposite and hire someone and treat it like an official role, you can also include a clause to discuss equity if they hit realistic targets down the line in writing. Make sure you are compensating appropriately as your definition of traction was not defined and it varies ex. DAU with 0 money to dollars being generated",

I've been pitching to a lot of VCs, pre-seed companies that really like my app idea. But it's still in the ideation/pitch stage. There is no physical app created at the moment. I'm still creating the prototype with a plug and play software. So I was advised by many other VCs, that really like my idea to find a tech partner/CTO. I've heard about Y Combinator and I've submitted to that, just waiting for a response but where Also, can I find new CTO/tech founders to come in at 45% equity as cofounder? There's a Lotta great gems in this thread, but was wondering if there might be more focused responses for US based options on where to find such cofounder?",

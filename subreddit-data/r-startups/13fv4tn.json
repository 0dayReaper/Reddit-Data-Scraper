    "postText": "We built our MVP using WordPress, have onboarded a handful of users, and we're generating revenue.   \n\nHere's my concern... To scale this thing, we'll need to rebuild from scratch. As you know, that's time and labor-intensive. \n\nWe're bootstrapping, so building a team is not an option.   \n\nOur platform has been patched with various APIs and plugins that are only as good as the next update.   \n\nHere are our options for creating a stable, scalable platform:  \n\n1) Rebuild from scratch.   \n\n2) Replace the core of our product with an off-the-shelf solution from one of our vendors. Stable but limited in functionality. This allows us to scale, raise, and rebuild later.   \n\n3) Modify the functionality of our main plugin, allowing us to API into various vendors.   \n\nHoping you can offer a different perspective. Thanks.",

We did have to spend a lot of money on it, probably more then the cost of building the solution from scratch, but it gave us the opportunity to slowly develop the product as we learned what our users needed and allowed for pivoting much faster than a custom-built product would have allowed us to do.\n\nJust be mindful about the reasons why you would need to build tour product from scratch: \nIs it performance? It can be optimized. \nIs it that your team hates WP? not a good reason for us PMs.\nIs it that you are a bit ashamed of saying it\u2019s built on WP? Turn it into something to be proud of. Thanks to WP you exist and your customers can ease their pain NOW.\n\nUnless it is an extremely technical product, you should be able to scale up with it! At least until you get enough revenue to pay for the new development.",

It should be the fastest to implement - which Is a critical advantage to keep - and it will keep your development cycle the same (as opposed to going from using OFS to all bespoke by building from scratch).\n\nThe scalability and extensibility concern sounds like an unknown. Unknown about what the relevant limitations are and unknown about when it would become a problem. It would be worth trying to get answers to those unknowns. If you could get specific about the actual concerns within this category of scalability and extensibility (e.g. how many users can it handle, or how many products) then figure out a way to get answers to those questions and measure the impact (e.g. add a significantly large number of users and test out site speed). The plug-in\u2019s support team should be good help for this.\n\nKnowing when scalability and extensibility would be a problem can help you during your fundraise, it could be that you may not need to worry about it at all during this round, or perhaps the problem is much more urgent than just thought and the main spend would be to get past the problem, or maybe you will have pivoted before it\u2019s a problem and the plug-in is no longer relevant to the product and has been removed.",

If this is not the case for e.g. its marketplace or twitter like app than you can look for vertical scalability on any of the cloud providers. You can have upto 512GB RAM. So you can scale without building a team until you have enough revenue to hire people. My suggestion is to concentrate on getting more revenue until you can afford to hire and postpone the rebuilding decision till than.",

If I can cobble together a bunch of WordPress plugins and get 90% of the way there (I don't to worry about membership/accounts, SEO, reinventing faceted search UI, integrating a payment system, building a marketplace, etc.) and then just focus on custom code for the one or two special ideas my SaaS helps solve, I consider that a win. Even a competitive advantage because I didn't spend a buttload of time building an MVP that may never get used. If it ends up being successful then cool. I'll slide my credit card for a bigger VM to help it \"scale\" while I determine the next best coarse of action. That might mean custom building it out from scratch or it could mean staying the course if feature-wise I don't see a lot of complexity coming up on the roadmap that WordPress would make it more painful to handle. But just upgrading your server to be more beefy is waaaay cheaper than paying a development teams tens of thousands of dollars a month just to rebuild it.",

It is tempting to have it do x AND y AND z, and indeed many customers would choose your solution only for that reason. But unfortunately as a startup, even if you had unlimited VC funding, that's a dead end route. As a small player you have capacity to do 1 thing well; that's hard enough, most startups don't make it because they have 0 things to offer they are truly great at.\n\nIn your case, you have \"tools and solutions for creators\". Choose one specific problem of one specific group of creators (the smaller the better) and solve it well. Maybe it's \"streamline creation\", or maybe it's \"optimise promotion\", or maybe it's monetisation, or maybe it's storefront. Gotta be one thing; it cannot be AND - it has to be OR. Just one thing done well; for everything else you need to fit whatever you want to offer into the existing ways of doing things.\n\nMaybe indeed you compete with Teespring - but then product designer it's gotta be literally the only thing you do (or more likely pick a small part of what Teespring does and do just that better). Sites with customizer sounds like an entirely different problem to be solved by a different product. You have too choose, otherwise you'll end up doing many things OK but nothing best in class; and when you have one thing best in class then it pays to stop doing anything else. Its not important what it is; but it's critical that it's one small specific thing, not several.\n\nAll other things equal, replace every feature but one with existing solutions, even if they are worse than what you built, is the way. Don't try to build a \"platform\" people want simple solutions to small problems that are overlooked; not big shiny things. The latter feel much better to build though, and that's the danger.",

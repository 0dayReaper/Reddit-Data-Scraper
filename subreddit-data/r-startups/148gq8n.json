Would love tips on how to think about this, mainly:  \n\\- What channels are worth using (should we do paid ads?)  \n\\- Are there online communities or events worth looking to for awareness?  \n\n\nThe startup is currently in beta and has several customers, so this is more of a launch of the new brand and several product updates.",

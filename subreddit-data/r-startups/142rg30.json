    "postText": "Hey everyone!\r  \n\r  \nI'm currently on the lookout for a software or website that can assist me in finding a comprehensive list of companies operating in the fitness industry.\r  \n\r  \nIdeally, the platform should give me the possibility of searching companies by specifying the industry (in this case, fitness). It would be great if it could include details such as the company's name, location, services provided, and perhaps even reviews or ratings from customers.\n\nI was thinking about doing this on Linkedin but I would like to hear what you think about about and if you have other software that can help me  \n\n\n\rLooking forward to your responses and thank you in advance for your assistance!",

    "postText": "I work in digital advertising and the Reddit means of generating revenue and not passing it on to mods and content creators is really fucked up.  I'm wondering if anyone out here would be interested in a grassroots effort in building a community like Reddit but with a change in the structure of how moderating and advertising works.\n\nRight now being a mod is volunteer work.  It's pretty much thankless, and for the mods who perform a good job it's still met with loads of BS.  Further for the really popular subs there's a ton of advertising run against it but with none of that paid out to the people who maintain the community.  Let's change that. Let's give mods a piece of the pie.  Instead of ads showing up programmatically with only a sub used as a targeting parameter, ads would be tracked specifically in which subs they show up.  All the standard metrics of impressions, clicks, and video completes would be tracked, and the amount of ad rev paid to a mod would be dynamic based on the growth and ad-viewing activity of users in it.\n\nFurther based on this, subs could act as their own sub-publisher and allow for greater control at the sub level in terms of direct sponsorships / partnerships, and more engagement by brands with the members of a sub.  There is certainly going to be some issues in terms of how mods are paid (especially within certain jurisdictions for taxation and employment laws).  To prevent too much centralized control there would be a number of mods required based on size of the sub and revenue generated, and ultimately the people who own / run this site would determine the structure of sub moderation.  \n\nThis site would also be NSFW friendly which won't affect the way brands approach it.  Apple, Intel, Macy's, etc are all advertising on reddit with NSFW guardrails around where those ads are setup.  Simple enough to create those flags and black/whitelists.\n\nWe would make the advertising API open and allow for quick deployment of ads through a self-service portal.  \n\nIs there a way for us to make a 3rd party-app friendly framework as well that would help keep the costs of allowing 3rd party apps low?\n\nThe content / post feed would be algorithm based similar to how things are currently done here, but with yet another little twist.  If you're an original content creator, why not monetize your work?  Let ads play a role in how someone can support themselves based on the audience they reach with their work.  \n\nI'm also wondering if it's worth taking a look at the video player and building something from the ground up with better compression and delivery that's mobile-friendly vs the absolute shit heap that is the current reddit player.  Fuck this tik-tok style bullshit.  \n\nObviously this would be a massive undertaking.  Getting the word out about it would a huge undertaking as well, but that's where my background in this space would come in to play.\n\nAny feedback would be welcome!",

It just doesn't work, the bubble burst a long time ago. \n\nThe way forward now is to build with revenue. Find a killer hook of an idea, deploy an MVP at single community scale within a month or two, monetize, and grow from there. If you can't get that far, or attract venture capital, the idea doesn't have the groundswell to scale.\n\nFor clarity - reddit is reddit, and reddit isn't broken. If the pain point is mods aren't getting paid, then the solution is to find a way to create an industry selling the services of content moderators and community managers who want to get paid for it - not rebuild reddit, because you will never topple reddit by trying to be reddit 2.0.",

To have something successful now with vast numbers of users you need a novel and contrarian idea that is lucky enough to be something that will be at the height of popularity in 3-5 years time when you hit peak growth. Almost impossible to predict, and hugely expensive to build and scale during that time.\n\nAll of the big guys started with a small and simple idea with a niche community / audience and took those years to scale to mass market. Reddit is a perfect example. They went through typical adoption curve of finding innovators and early adopters first to help accelerate growth. They then spent 3 years growing with a big team and no revenue. Facebook the same.\n\nWhat's changed now is that the digital space is completely over saturated and people are mentally overloaded.  back when reddit was born you could have launched anything and people flocked to it like a new skyscraper built on the block. Now, it's an actual grind to get any users for anything - and that's dangerous.\n\nYou need to find really strong market fit early because the risk of a dud product is so incredibly high. Realistically you want to be finding and converting your early adopters before you've even built anything - because if you don't have them, you don't have a business and never will.",

I just feel like the premise of Reddit, while good, is an exploitation based mechanism of having mods spend a lot of time unpaid to do the work that Reddit should be doing themselves to an extent, but doesn\u2019t. And as a result that volunteer work is creating a brand safe environment through which Reddit is profiting greatly from.",

They will not.\n\nReddit started with a small user base where everyone in the same pool. Subreddits were not really used like this in the beginning, it's a problem of massive growth and scale. Your moderators will have nobody to moderate without the massive growth, and the massive growth cannot happen if your value offer is just for the moderators.\n\nYou are not wrong. Your identification of the problems are all correct, but I think the solution is wrong, and your vision is very tactical. Starting businesses for tactical reasons will get you in a tangle really fast.",

The way this used to be handled was VC and PE funds dumping free money on you until you got big enough to sell. Those days are behind us so instead you have entrenched players who don't have to move quickly and can continue making poor, user-hostile decisions.\n\nPut another way, Tiktok has spent many billions on user acquisition.",

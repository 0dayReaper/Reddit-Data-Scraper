    "postText": "Hello, I'm looking to get some advice on launching a subscription box business, how to establish as a \"legitimate brand\" with brand partnerships and etc. I have no network/connections in this field or experience.  \nI have a brief business plan, I know that I need to do market research, identify similar ideas/competition, identify my market and etc.  \nI don't know where to start, in the past I've been in our family apparel business but it has started and now, to this date, still run as a mom-and-pop. This time I don't want to do that, I want to make partnerships/have sponsorships with big/known brands.",

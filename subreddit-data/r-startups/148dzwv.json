    "postText": "I\u2019m on my third startup and this one from day one is just striking different. After almost two years, we have pivoted a few times, recently had a few rounds of layoffs, and are now starting to lose some key executives. \n\nI joined this startup at a leadership level because I wanted to get experience in the space and genuinely thought I could grow into the executive team. \n\nAt the moment, I\u2019m not worried that my equity (including personal money I invested) are not going to be worth anything despite being told we\u2019re valued above $1B multiple times by the CEO. Culturally, I\u2019m afraid to talk about my own growth with any members of the executive team, including my boss, because I feel like it\u2019s perceived poorly and actually stunts my growth to talk about it. I asked my CEO for a growth plan about a year ago and he said I need to be patient and asked me to read a book, which I read. \n\nI really want this to work out, but thinking that enough is enough. My two year Cliff is at the end of the summer, but feel like I\u2019m on a sinking ship. I\u2019m giving it my all to make this work, but feel like I\u2019m just annoying everyone by asking to create and execute plans. \n\nHas anyone had this type of experience before? Appreciate any and all perspective and advice to round out my thought process.",

The question I would ask is do you feel you've exhausted all your ideas that could contribute to the growth and success of the startup?\n\nIf the answer is yes then I would agree and move on. However, if the answer is no then I would stick around longer and try everything you can think of. \n\nThe reason I think this is important is that when you look back on this part of your career - will you ever have any regrets? By knowing that you exhausted all options, I think you would say I have no regrets about my final decision.",

Network, read, learn- that\u2019s how you\u2019ll continue to grow. At a very senior level, there likely isn\u2019t anybody in your functional area to even help you grow at your org.

I read a few similars stories and my personal experience resonates with your post.\n\n As a recent C dropout from a pre series A startup , who managed to get out with an ok % of vested options, I can recommend you to wait a little bit just enough beyond the cliff if it is not too far ahead. Also read very careful all your contracts and shareholder agreements to be sure you don\u2019t miss any deadlines or quit too early. Wait and see how you feel beyond the summer without overcommitting. Perhaps the boat stays afloat.\n\nThe truth is in a startup most of the times C hires or other leadership positions who get lured in through options or phantom shares, usually are in an imbalanced power relationship, undervalued and working to make other ones potentially rich from day zero.\n\nIt is known that the work environment in startups is rarely healthy. There are lots of insecurities out of lack of experience, which make owners make often bad decisions. Such as burning the budget fast, hiring and firing fast, attempting to build and build and build\u2026 fail and fail and fail, fast fast fast. \n\nI hope the mindset from new startups changes and focuses more on thoroughly planing and building a strategy for sustainable growth, hence focus more on effective core problem solving,  effective value creation, realistic revenue metrics and moves away from the phantasy of the next xyz unicorn \ud83e\udd84 \n\nIt\u2019s up to you to get out with at least a good lottery ticket in your pocket if your health and patience allows it without compromises. But if not, always prioritize your health. You\u2019ll never get back the time you waste being frustrated or even getting sick about other people\u2019s battles.\n\nGood luck \ud83c\udf40",

This is classic smokescreen. \n\nSecond, it sounds like they brought in inexperienced people into leadership positions.  This is not necessarily a bad thing per se, but serious adult guidance should be with the team in the forms of VC, advisors, board of directors, etc.  \n\nYou should assess if this company has what it takes to navigate the hardships, and the reasons why you joined.",

Did it explain a growth plan in any way? It's not a good thing if the CEO can't answer questions like this to someone on the leadership team... How well does he do his job anyway?\n\nAlso being worth 1B on paper means nothing for a VC funded company. In 2013 there were 7 unicorns and in 2022 there were 750. But no one wants to raise a down round so if you raise several times, your valuation will be driven up by the prior VCs insisting that the future rounds be at a higher valuation which creates ridiculous valuations not grounded in reality.",

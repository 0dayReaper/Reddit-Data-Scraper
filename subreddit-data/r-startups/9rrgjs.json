    "postText": "...is the single best answer to the most common startup questions, especially from people straight out of college trying to figure out how to start a company. \n\n\"I can't afford a developer/lawyer/incorporation.\" \n\nGet a job. Save your money. Use that.\n\n\"Investors won't return my emails/say I'm too early.\"\n\nGet a job. Save your money. Use that. \n\n\"I don't know what problem to solve.\"\n\nGet a job. You'll learn the mechanics of that industry and see how deals go down. \n\nLook for problems - with your company's workflow, with your coworkers' personal lives, with your suppliers, and with your customers. Look for opportunities to put deals together from that position. A business development or sales gig is especially perfect for that reason; it might enable you to put a deal together and have revenue on day 1. \n\n\"I can't find good co-founders/employees.\"\n\nGet a job. There's no better measure of someone's future performance than their past performance, and working with people in your company and within folks in the broader industry will clue you into the best developers, marketers, pr people, ops people, etc in your area. If you're aggressive about meeting people and asking questions. There's also been more than one founder that met their investors indirectly through a former employer. \n\nMost importantly, if getting a mid-level role at a company seems daunting, I can promise that actually starting a company is way harder. All the skills you'll learn navigating that process - pitching yourself, creating a good narrative, convincing people of your ideas, navigating workplace culture/politics, learning to be as highly productive as you can, and managing budgets/other people ideally - are skills that are absolutely essential for startup execution. \n\nIf you take 3-5 years to do this and play it right, you'll end up with 1) intimate knowledge of an industry, 2) strong experience in whatever function you had, 3) $100K-$150K in savings if you're being smart financially, and 4) tons of connections - to potential customers, cofounders, investors, partners, and employees, all of which you'll need at some point. \n\nImagine taking a crack at the startup game with all of the above? Plus unique insight due to your experience? And the comfort of knowing that you have plenty of savings and a resume/skills that can land you another job?",

One lost 100k another one was 400k in debt &amp; had to be bought out by another major entertainment company in order to stay afloat the founder of this 5 year running event had to relinquish the majority of their stake. The company that was my day-job ended up being a front &amp; didn't even make enough to cover the overhead of the store. It's hanging on by a thread &amp; I quit before filing for lost wages (*owner pressured me* __not through legal action__ *into avoiding taking it to court*). People often stiff you in the end especially on freelance projects you have to be extraordinarily careful about how your present/display your work to potential clients because they'll always search for ways to fineness you out of your time/talents(98% of mutual business partners are super shady). Either by hiring a shortcut around your specialties *(downsizing)* to cut costs on you or keeping you as indefinite temp work in which you'll be handling more responsibilities than your contract states &amp; incapable of legally billing them for it. Job markets extremely *Fucked* for this type of labor for like __3 fold__ catastrophic reasons(*Hint*: your gf's Instagram obsession/hobby's one reason), &amp; impermanence/internships are the *worst of their kind* in this industry, even worse than Pre-med where you have to pay to shadow doctors at hospitals. + The industry's changing, because our economy's changing so it further complicates an already unconventional career choice. \n\n- The funny thing about being an artist is that people assume you're clueless. Trust me, if you've thought of a solution we're already ahead of you. Outsiders don't know our industry as well as we do, that's why companies contract us out &amp; take our invoices. ",

You have to be mentally prepared for this think, you need a lot of knowledge how to run business and perfect communication skills. Being straight out of collage without even having an idea and trying to do something is a bit of wasted time.\n\nListen the OP, get a job and meanwhile read a lot of self-help books to sharpen your mind. Being entrepreneur  it's not that easy, it's maybe the hardest thing to be, so you have to be prepared for this.\n\nGet a job and wait until the right conditions to come and then take action.\n\nIt's not a waste of time to work for someone else - you make contacts, you develop your skills, you're learning. Starting your own company at the age of 30 it's not bad at all, you're still young, even 40 is good enough. Don't rush it so much, take your time, learn things, be prepared.",

                            "comment": "Entrepreneur is a personality trait, it's not a career. Right? You can't get a job as an entrepreneur.  Ultimately the study of one of two things: a profession or the theory and practice, the academics.  You can study to be a Doctor.  That's a job. You can study history. That's not a job.\n\nTechnically what schools do is really just sell what's in demand.  Let's not fool ourselves that schools are pillars of academics and more than the idea that news media is completely trustable. They sell education.  They sell what students buy.  \n\nEntrepreneurship is something more and more young people want.  They see it on TV, they want independence from a company, they know that employers aren't loyal to people anyway.  So they're drawn to \"entrepreneur,\" much more than in years before.  And schools are happy to full fill it (sell it).\n\nYet there is no such job.  And the data has affirmed for decades that the average age of a successful entreprenuer is 40... That the keys to success are experience, wealth, and a professional network - things Universities can't provide.  \n\nSo it falls on the more academic side of the  study.  It's more like studying public speaking or history, you can study it but there isn't such a job and you really only excel with experience. But they sell it with the inspiration that anyone can start something.  That you can be an entrepreneur too!  And it's misleading.  \n",

Also - that governments and demand are pushing institutions to have degrees in entrepreneurship and the institutions are following suit. Institutions are pretty desperate for students - its crazy how many completely new degree programs have been invented in the past 10 years - including this one.

Getting to understand the foundations of a successful professional business should be a priority if you want long term success because even if you have short fast growth in your company, if you don't know how to maintain it and grow it further you will not have a business in the future. Successful businesses run for 10+ years. So get a job first haha.",

    "postText": " My question is: Where in the economic growth zone should we even begin to hire outside help (employees)? \n\nI\u2019ve set up my business model to be profitable from day one. We have low overhead and everything we make we will put into the business to grow. Is there a point when you can tell that it is the right time to starting expanding and hiring? \n\nAlso is it appropriate or advisable to take outside money even when the company is generating and growing enough to be self sustaining and slowly growing. \n\nFor sake of example ill paint a rough one. Say some months from now we are making a few thousand a month or so. Should we just keep going and start slowly hiring folks and looking for a place to work from. Or should i be taking those X months of growth and traction and all the metrics investors want to see and seek some funding. \n\nBtw I\u2019m not predicting one thing or the other. I am simply painting a scenario in order to ask a question. \n\nI\u2019m almost asking if all businesses take outside money in their journey to growth. \n\nThank you for your time!",

Hire when you feel the pain b/c you'll know the acute pain/problem you're looking to solve with the early hire. \n\nAnd as for $, if you're profitable and can bootstrap, do that for as long as possible. And when you do need money, look at traditional finance options like bank loans or credit lines to fund growth so you can retain equity. VC is not the only game in town, and it comes with a TON of strings and pressures that most founders fail to account for.",

Bootstrapping goes a long way. No money is free money and funding is like drugs \u2013\u00a0it can help you live but it can also be the death of you. Bootstrapping sustainability means you have completely freedom &amp; control over your business, which is priceless.\n\nThat being said, funding is not bad for everyone and it has its place and time. But from the little I know, seems like you guys are fine without it. In which case, I'd say keep doing what you're doing and grow at a comfortable speed.",

Hiring great talent is hard enough as it is; and a wrong hire can set you back quite a bit. I\u2019d start with asking what are you considering \nhiring for? Can you find contract talent or a fractional employee (either generalist or specialist based on the answer to the previous question) to help if you truly need the help? A person like that can be quick and easy to cut ties with without all the baggage of a FTE. Between you and fractional employees/contractors find a way to create some initial traction in the various parts of the business then hire FT to begin scaling those systems.",

This is a situation where it may make sense to hire a \"freelancer\" or \"contractor\" that is focused on one specific area of your business instead of hiring a full-time employee that becomes a liability for you moving forward.\n\nIn terms of raising outside money. If you don't need it, I would not take it unless you believe the partnership will drive significant value for your business growth.",

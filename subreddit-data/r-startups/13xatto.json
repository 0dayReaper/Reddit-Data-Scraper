    "postText": "Almost four years ago, I started a Digital Marketing Agency as a hobby, which has since grown into a profitable business, which I run on my own.\n\nI'm not based in the US, so explaining economics might be hard. But to put you in context: Minimum wage here is $8K/month (Local currency). A manager at a large company makes anywhere from 20k to 50k/month (higher end, living more than comfortably, nice car, clothes, qualifies for a nice house mortgage) on average, and my company (one man band) is making 120k/month. \n\nI'm now considering hiring my financially struggling friend, who currently earns $8k a month, to assist me. Initially, I plan to pay him $12k, gradually increasing it to $15k per month. In the future, I also envision making him a partner in the company, as I believe he would be a valuable asset and help me free up more time to focus on client acquisition and web design.\n\nMy intention, once we become partners, is to oversee everything, manage customer relationships, and delegate most of the day-to-day work to him, thereby allowing me to have more free time.\n\nIt's important to note that due to my upcoming medical residency, having a trusted partner would enable me to balance my professional commitments effectively.\n\nHowever I am having two challenges:\n1) Determining the right time to transition from a boss-employee relationship to becoming partners.\n\nAnd 2) Deciding on a fair equity split. Given that I established the business and nurtured it over the past four years, building connections and brand recognition plus all the marketing investment I've done. I'm uncertain about the appropriate division of equity.\n\nAlthough I could hire a regular employee to handle the tasks my friend would perform, partnering with him ensures the security of my business idea and customer base, which is the main and only reason making him a partner makes sense.\n\nI think I could offer him the salary (15k) from now until we make 200k/month. And give him a 12% of the company by then and then 20-25% once we get to 300k/month (and we'd get a designer or two to help in between the 200k and 300k milestone). But we would also share the bills we have to pay by then.\n\nDoes this sound fair?\n\nIn my mind this makes sense because being realistic I could just hire someone else for the same money (I'm even paying above average for a graphic designer) and give no equity at all.",

Or 2-6 times what a manager makes here. Which is by no means huge but it is a nice accomplishment if I tell you that's already net. So the company has grown.\n\nAlso, the problem is not the base salary $12 to 15k, but when would it make sense to make him a partner and how much equity would it be fair to give him given the scenario? (or does it even make sense at all?, Should I just keep him as an employee?).\n\nDo you think the vesting idea I have is fair?",

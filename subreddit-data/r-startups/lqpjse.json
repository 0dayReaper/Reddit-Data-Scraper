    "postText": "_Reposting a redacted version because previous post got removed for mentioning product identifying details._\n\n11 months ago I posted on r/startups asking What is the reason no one is competing with UpWork?.\n\nIt has been a crazy year since!\n\nI've moved to SF.\n\nI met my co-founder during COVID.\n\nWhen we realized that our goals were aligned we've committed to building this together.\n\nFrom there on we'd meet every morning, share breakfast, brainstorm on the whiteboard (very old school I know), work together, &amp; take long walks way past sunset.\n\nOur friendship grew stronger and so did our conviction about the size of the opportunity.\n\nAnd once we realized how big this thing could be, we started recruiting our engineers, designers, community team, ... all around the idea of giving everyone the freedom and opportunity to work independently.\n\nWe've hired a ton of extraordinarily talented &amp; caring people. We've raised our pre-seed, seed and series A. We've are building an amazing product using an amazing technology stack.\n\n[redacted]\n\nToday I am the happiest I've ever been, working with the greatest team in the world, solving a problem I deeply care about. We just had our (mostly remote) launch party, and I just wanted to share this excitement with r/startups and encourage everyone to never give up if you are truly convinced about something. \ud83d\ude0a",

Another good thing is give new freelancers a chance. And I really hate the success score on Upwork. It needs to be less complex.",

When working an hourly rate job, do not extend past the weekly hour limit set by the client. Upwork warns you when you're getting close, but you need to reach out to the client and request to add extra hours to the weekly time limit. If you do keep working past the set limit, Upwork will not count those hours and they don't alert the client of overtime. If you have a good client, they can manually add the overtime as a bonus payment... and we all know how terrible the UI is and how hard it can be for the client to navigate.\n2. On fixed rate jobs with milestones, I only work up to my hourly rate for a milestone. Say my hourly rate is $80/hr and the milestone is $160, I only work 2 hours of time--and I communicate this to clients before accepting an offer. This protects me and ensures I'm getting paid for my time accurately. If you work beyond a milestones fixed rate, there's no guarantee a client will pay for that time. This is where people take advantage of the system, asking for more work, saying they'll pay you when it's complete, only to bail and never pay beyond the milestones original fee.\n\nIt might seem like really common sense stuff... but Upwork doesn't make all of the nitty gritty details clear unless you go digging around in their help center.",

            "comment": "I just hired my first developer on Upwork not too long ago!  And let me tell you, here are some improvements I want to impart:\n\n* Upwork only accepts Credit Cards, and then surcharges me for the 3% for doing so (this is because it's fees charged by credit card companies to them).  At Upwork's scale, I'd expect their blended credit card fees to be closer to 1.5% so I have a sneaky feeling they're profiting from surcharging me, and it's technically against VISA/Mastercard rules to do so. I'll happily switch to ACH payments if they offer it to avoid the 3%.  I've spent $10K to date, and would have saved me $300.   **TL;DR:** Integrate with a payment service provider that happily accepts ACH payments and incentivize this.\n* Upwork is asking me to pay $50 to access \"premium reports\" on how the performance of the people I've hired are.  WTF?  Like, you're already taking 20% commission on their work, you want to charge me to now know what I'm getting?  That seems like a money grab.  **TL;DR**: Focus on providing real-true value to both developers and people looking for talent. Don't make everything about a money grab.\n\nUpwork's Competitive Advantageous:\n\n* Upwork does an amazing job as gating people from charging US prices for work done outside of the U.S in cheaper areas. I know this because people have reached out to me personally wiling to pay me $1000 per week simply to use my Upwork account.  Upwork does an amazing job identifying VPN services and blocking them. As a result, I **trust** Upwork's ability to recognize someone is lying about their location.  Despite this, things do fall through the cracks. For example, one of the people who bid on my project was \"Krishna. \" who was from \"San Antonio, TX\" and bidding to work $4.00/hr on my project.\" SURE buddy.  I interviewed him anyway to see if they were worth their salt, they weren't.\n* There is actually a lot of people on their, and while the talent is like any other hiring platform (hit and miss), I'm confident I can find someone who can do the work I need them if I wait and be selective enough.",

I really liked that you can change the e-mail on sign-up. Everybody should do this!\n\n3. On sign-up, the Roles are not very intuitive. They are mandatory but there are not examples. After I started typing some random stuff suggestions came up but I found to be very limited. I noticed they are highly geared towards web development. I understand this may be by design but it is extremely alienating and frustrating to a user to no find anything related to what they do.\n\n4. Profile pictures are required, which is a bit annoying. Also annoying is that upon upload, the preview it displays (with the options to change the zoom) does not actually match the thumbnail it generates.

It was suggested that the community might benefit from having it turned into its own thread. Not being one to turn down a sanctioned opportunity to collect Karma, I'm happy to oblige.*\n\n***Note 2: The tables may not format correctly on mobile. Sorry!***\n\nMost founders share a dream. That dream being that one day, after a lot of hard work, someone will knock on their door and offer them a Scrooge McDuckian pile of money for their startup. However in order to get to this point, a founder will likely need to raise money from investors to grow. The terms attached to those investments will influence how any final buyout proceeds are distributed. If a founder isn't careful, they may find that their boat money turns out to be bus fare.\n\nTo understand why, we first need to understand how a startup grows and issues equity.\n\nWhen a startup is founded, its founders divide up the equity in it by issuing shares. The resources brought to the table can vary, but usually they\u2019re just enough to get to some sort of proof of concept phase. We can visualize the outstanding shares of the company with what\u2019s known as a Capitalization Table (Cap Table). At this point, it might look something like this.\n\n    \t\t\tShares\t\t% Owned \n    Founders\t\t1,000,000\t100 \n\nA lot of successful startups don\u2019t grow using their own resources. In fact, with startups that have huge opportunity and potential, doing so would be far too slow. In order to reach their potential, they sell shares to investors. The amount of money they need to raise is usually based on expectations of what will be required to meet a certain milestone, with the number of shares issued being determined by a valuation metric that\u2019s beyond the scope of this discussion. This process is usually done multiple times in order to reach successive milestones. Each fundraising round is referred to as a Series, and generally assigned a letter. After the first round (Series A), the Cap Table might look like this.\n\n    \t\t\tShares\t\t% Owned \n    Founders\t\t1,000,000\t50 \n    Series A\t\t1,000,000\t50 \n\nAs startups grow, they acquire non-founding employees. However working for startups carries risk. It\u2019s a business that\u2019s more likely to fail, and sometimes it can\u2019t afford to pay what a more established company could. In order to compensate these employees for that risk, they\u2019re generally issued Stock Options that allow them to buy shares of the company at some point in the future, for the price today.\n\nThis is great for the employees, but it creates an issue for investors. If I give you $10M for 1,000,000 shares thinking I\u2019ll own 50% of your company until the next Series, and you issue 1,000,000 options to employees who all decide to exercise those options, I won\u2019t actually own 50% of your company. I\u2019ll only own 33%. This is what is referred to as Dilution. The issuing of additional shares reduces the overall % of a company held by any specific shareholder.\n\nIn order to avoid this, Pools are established with each Series, so all investors know the smallest possible (fully diluted) position they may be expected to have in a company before the next Series. Employee Pools tend to be between 10 and 20%. We\u2019ll assume our startup is generous. After Series A, the (fully-diluted) Cap Table might look something like this:\n\n    \t\t\tShares\t\t% Owned \n    Founders\t\t1,000,000\t40%\t \n    Series A\t\t1,000,000\t40% \n    Employee Pool\t        500,000\t        20% \n\nIt should be noted that we are now assuming that all employees choose to exercise their options, and that our startup fully issues its employee pool. If a company continues to increase in value (or is bought), the first assumption is safe. The second assumption is rarely valid, but simplifies our example. We'll address contrary situations later.\n\nGenerally the employee pool size is adjusted to maintain its size relative to total outstanding shares. Let\u2019s assume we\u2019ve had two more funding rounds in our startup. The Cap Table might look something like this:\n\n    \t\t\tShares\t\t% Owned \n    Founders\t\t1,000,000\t14.5% \n    Series A\t\t1,000,000\t14.5% \n    Series B\t\t2,000,000\t29.1% \n    Series C\t\t1,500,000\t21.8% \n    Employee Pool\t        1,375,000\t20.0% \n\nNow comes the big day. The company sold for $100M all cash. A few things come into play here. First off, not all options are exercisable immediately. That\u2019s the Vesting process, which is designed to keep employees at a company. Many option agreements indicate that upon qualifying event (such as a sale), any unvested options immediately vest. However sometimes they don\u2019t.\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t they? Because the person buying the company needs to know the employees are going to stay. They just paid a lot of money for the company, and that means the staff to run it as well. Sometimes they offer new incentives to keep those employees, but often it\u2019s easier to just keep them on their old incentives. Sometimes a company will attempt to get its employees to waive any accelerated vesting provisions in order to reduce the size of the employee pool. This isn't often in the best interest of those employees, and acts to increase potential distribution to founders and investors. Something to keep in mind.\n\nCritically, there\u2019s something known as Liquidation Preference. Liquidation preferences, when they exist, can be the most important factor in determining how much a given shareholder receives in a buyout. **Not all shares are created equally.** Sometimes when a company needs to raise money, they need to let new investors know they will receive their money back before existing investors do. If they really need the money and are having a hard time raising it, they may even have to tell new investors that they\u2019ll receive multiple times their money back before existing investors receive any money.\n\nWhy would existing investors agree to this? Because if the business fails, they\u2019ll definitely lose all of their investment. So it\u2019s better to agree to take less, than lose everything.\n\nLiquidation preferences can do weird things to payouts. Let\u2019s use our startup as an example. We\u2019ll need some additional information.\n\nFounders (and employees) hold what is called common stock. Common stock splits whatever funds are left after paying out all other shares.\n\nSeries A paid $2,000,000 for their shares. These are 2x non-participating, meaning that they can choose to receive back 2x their original investment, or convert their shares to common stock. They cannot do both, and so will do whichever would result in their getting the most money.\n\nSeries B paid $10,000,000 for their shares. These are 2x participating, meaning that they\u2019ll receive back 2x their original investment \\*and\\* they\u2019ll convert to common stock and receive a portion of the remaining funds.\n\nSeries C paid $15,000,000 for their shares. These are 3x participating 5x capped, meaning that they\u2019ll receive back 3x their original investment and convert to common to receive a portion of remaining funds, however they cannot receive more than 5x their original investment\n\nSeem confusing? It definitely can be. There are a lot of different ways liquidation preferences can be build, but generally participating, multiples, and caps are the ones you\u2019ll see.\n\nHow does this play out with our $100M buyout?\n\nSeries C receives 3x their initial investment, or $45,000,000 and converts to common stock. There\u2019s still $55,000,000 left to distribute.\n\nSeries B receives 2x their initial investment, or $20,000,000 and converts to common stock. There\u2019s still $35,000,000 left to distribute.\n\nNow Series A has a choice. It could receive 2x its original investment, which would be $4,000,000. Or it could choose to be treated as common stock. If it chose to do this, all classes in our original cap table would be common (as all other series converted). Therefore it would receive 14.5ish% of the remaining $35,000,000, or $5,090,909. This is clearly the better choice, so Series A chooses to convert to common.\n\nThis leaves us with $35,000,000 to distribute to our common shares based on their respective share of common stock owned, and a final distribution as follows.\n\n    \t\tShares       % Common   $ from Liq    $ from Common\t$ Total        % of Proceeds \n    Founders\t1,000,000    14.5%\t$0\t      $5,090,909\t$5,090,909     5.1% \n    Series A\t1,000,000    14.5%\t$0\t      $5,090,909        $5,090,909     5.1% \n    Series B\t2,000,000    29.1%\t$20,000,000   $10,181,818\t$30,181,818    30.1% \n    Series C\t1,500,000    21.8%\t$45,000,000   $7,636,363\t$52,636,363    52.6% \n    Employee Pool\t1,375,000    20.0%\t$0\t      $7,000,000\t$7,000,000     7% \n\nNotice how the % of proceeds actually received are drastically different from the % of shares held? That\u2019s the effect of liquidation preferences, and why they\u2019re so important.\n\nLet's compare this to another scenario where the buyout is only $80M.\n\nSeries C still receives 3x their initial investment, or $45,000,000 and converts to common stock. There\u2019s still $35,000,000 left to distribute.\n\nSeries B still receives 2x their initial investment, or $20,000,000 and converts to common stock. There\u2019s still $15,000,000 left to distribute.\n\nSeries A again has a choice. It could receive 2x its original investment, which would be $4,000,000. However this time if it chose to be common stock, it would receive 14.5ish% of $15,000,000 = $2,181,818. In this instance, it would choose to receive $4,000,000, and its shares would not convert to Common.\n\nNow our common distribution of the remaining $11,000,000 (80M - 45M - 20M - 4M) is as follows:\n\n               # Shares     % Common    $ from Common \n    Founders    1,000,000    17%         $1,872,340 \n    Series B    2,000,000    34%         $3,744,681 \n    Series C    1,500,000    25.5%       $2,808,511  \n    Employees   1,375,000    23.4%       $2,574,468 \n\nAnd our overall distribution looks like so:\n\n               # Shares    % Owned    $ Liq Pref    $ Common     $ Total        % of Payout \n    Founders    1,000,000    14.5%                   $1,872,340   $1,872,340     2.3%  \n    Series A    1,000,000    14.5%     $4,000,000                 $4,000,000     5%    \n    Series B    2,000,000    29.1%     $20,000,000   $3,744,681   $23,744,681    29.7%  \n    Series C    1,500,000    21.8%     $45,000,000   $2,808,511   $47,808,511    59.8%  \n    Employees   1,375,000    20.0%                   $2,574,468   $2,574,468     3.2% \n\nNotice the difference in payouts to each class. The purchase price in scenario 2 was 80% of the purchase price in scenario 1, but the payout to the founder and employees was less than half.\n\nEarlier we discussed the assumption that the Employee pool was fully issued (i.e. all options had been issued, and every option had been exercised.) This is important, because it affects distribution as well. To see why, first we need a little more information on what an option is.\n\nSimply put, an option is an agreement to acquire a number of shares for a set price (known as the Strike Price). Often times they'll only be valid between a set of dates. (Between the date of Vesting, and the date of expiry.) The strike price can be anything, but for tax purposes for employees it's generally the current share price on the day the option is issued. When you exercise an option, you pay the Strike Price, and you receive the shares.\n\nReturning to our example, we've assumed that the employee options are **in-the-money**, which is to say that the price they receive per share is greater than the strike price per share on the option. In our example, each employee would receive $1.87 per share owned ($2,574,468 / 1,375,000). If the strike price on the employee options was $3.00, an employee would choose not to exercise those options, as they would be agreeing to pay $3.00 to receive $1.87. If this were the case in our above example, the employees options would be worthless. Because no employee would exercise them, the resulting payout would look as follows:\n\n               # Shares    % Owned    $ Liq Pref    $ Common     $ Total        % of Payout \n    Founders    1,000,000    18.2%                   $2,444,444   $2,444,444     3.1%  \n    Series A    1,000,000    18.2%     $4,000,000                 $4,000,000     5%    \n    Series B    2,000,000    36.4%     $20,000,000   $4,888,889   $24,888,889    31,1%  \n    Series C    1,500,000    27.3%     $45,000,000   $3,666,667   $48,666,667    60.8%  \n    Employees   0            0%                      $0           $0             0%  \n\nNotice how everyone elses distribution increase when the employee options weren't exercised? This is why companies will sometimes try and prevent accelerated vesting of employee shares. The smaller that pool, the greater the funds available for distribution to other classes.\n\nLet's look at one final scenario to illustrate the effects of liquidation preference. At first glance, a $53M buyout seems exciting. Only $27M has been invested at this point. Let's see how it plays out.\n\nSeries C still receives 3x their initial investment, or $45,000,000 and converts to common stock. There\u2019s still $8,000,000 left to distribute.\n\nSeries B  receives $8,000,000 and converts to common stock.\n\nAnd that's it. All proceeds from the transaction have been distributed, meaning there are no funds available to be distributed to common stock. The final returns are as follows:\n\n               # Shares    % Owned    $ Liq Pref    $ Common     $ Total        % of Payout \n    Founders    1,000,000    14.5%                  $0           $0             0%  \n    Series A    1,000,000    14.5%                  $0           $0             0%\n    Series B    2,000,000    29.1%     $8,000,000   $0           $8,000,000     15.1%  \n    Series C    1,500,000    21.8%     $45,000,000  $0           $45,000,000    84.9%  \n    Employees   1,375,000    20.0%                  $0           $0             0% \n\nFounders, employees and Series A investors all receive nothing. All that work, and high risk early stage capital goes uncompensated.\n\nSo what's the point of working at all if all of the benefits are going to be scooped away? Well, it's important to note a few things about liquidation preferences like this.\n\n1. They tend to show up when a company is struggling to raise investment. If you're having a hard time raising capital, it's likely because there's some significant risk associated with your business. Maybe you've failed to meet your benchmarks. Maybe it's highly speculative. Whatever it is, the new investors want to know they'll get their money out first, and they'll make enough to compensate them from taking those risks. On the other hand, if you have a number of sources of investment interested, there likely won't be any liquidation preference. In fact, they may want to try and cash existing investors or founders out early in order to increase their own equity holdings. As rarehugs [pointed out in a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/a80v2g/how_will_my_wifes_stock_options_work_since_theyve/ec9x3b9) on the prior thread, a founder should think very carefully about cashing out early. If someone thinks your equity is worth buying now, it means they think it will be worth substantially more later.\n2. They generally only apply to private companies. Once you're public, selling your shares is generally much more straight forward. However it should be noted that often liquidation preferences apply to the process of going public. When you go public, generally all series are converted to common stock, or exited. **The order in which proceeds or common stock are issued during an IPO are often influenced by existing liquidation preferences.**\n\nNow that you understand the risks, what can you do as a founder to ensure you don't end up receiving less than you expect from your eventual exit?\n\nFirst, you're generally better off taking a lower valuation early on than you are a higher multiple. Later stage investors aren't likely to accept a multiple lower than one offered to previous stage investors. If you're trying to raise $500K for your seed round, and you have an offer to take 20% of your company with a 1x multiple (2.5M valuation) or 10% of your company with a 2x multiple (5M valuation), and you expect to require multiple future round of financing, you'd likely be better off with the lower valuation.\n\nSecond, don't raise more than you need. By their very nature, multiples work on the underlying investment. The more you raise, the higher the bar you need to achieve before you'll see proceeds for yourself.\n\nThird, when you're raising your first round of funding, model out your cap table all the way to when you expect to exit. Look at your long-term road map, and estimate how much money you'll need to raise at each stage to get there. Think about what your company will be worth when it hits each milestone. Build a cap table just like we did above, and see how much equity you'll have left, as well as what your distribution might be. Understanding the endgame helps you understand each step you take to get there in context.\n\nHopefully that provides some helpful information to some of you. Remember, it's not just about the amount of money you raise along the path, or what your company is worth. The terms attached to the money will ultimately determine how much of that you and your investors receive.\n\n**TL;DR: Liquidation Preferences, when they exist, can be the single most important item when raising funds, and can result in founders receiving a substantially smaller share of proceeds when they sell. Understand and pay attention to them.**\n\nEdit: I don't want to crowd out the discussion threads with Thank Yous to people for the kind words, but I'm reading them and absolutely appreciate them!

But in my opinion, asking shows that you are knowledgeable in a topic, which is another asset in your favour as an interviewee. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s critical that you know what your compensation is actually worth, so if they\u2019re hesitant to tell you, especially if options make up a significant portion of your compensation package and after you\u2019ve explained why you\u2019d like to know, I\u2019d be cautious as it may be an indicator of how they view their staff. \n\nThink of it this way. If I\u2019m offering you a job, and tell you I\u2019ll pay you 15,000 a month, but won\u2019t clarify what the currency is when asked, you probably have a reason to be concerned. \n\nHowever, as with all things, this is scenario dependant. If the company is already paying you a fair market wage in cash and providing competitive benefits, then the option package is likely seen as a sweetener as opposed to primary compensation. In these instances, you may get pushback on providing all of that information, and pressing the issue might be to your disadvantage as a candidate.  Since I\u2019m this example it\u2019s such a minor piece of your compensation anyway, you can decide if it\u2019s worth not being hired over. ",

Startup equity has a lot of risk attached to it. If you're relying on it for your primary means of compensation, you need to fully understand those risks, and even still consider the likely possibility that the only compensation you receive is the cash you're paid every 2 weeks.\n\nAlso, and it varies depending on the startup, potential employees shouldn't be afraid to ask about the cap table. If your founders don't want you seeing it, it doesn't hurt asking questions like \"How much preferred equity sits above the employees?\" and \"What's the minimum buyout amount that we'd have to receive in order for employees to receive proceeds from a buyout\". Part of the startup hiring \"pitch\" is that you have the potential to be part of a buyout. It's not out of line to ask questions to find out what that's worth.\n\nAs you said, they won't necessarily answer those questions. But that gives you information about how you might expect to be treated during a buyout as well.",

I probably recommend one of these two books at least once a week to someone new.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter Than Your Lawyer and Venture Capitalist by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\n\nSadly, if you weren't smarter than your lawyer and your VC going into the book, you likely won't be after reading it either. (But, having worked with a lot of VCs and lawyers, I think it's safe to say you very well might already be.) It does do a great job of walking you through what you might be expected to see on a term sheet when you go and raise money, as well as tips for negotiation and things to keep in mind. Fundraising is a chaotic and busy time. Being educated on the vocabulary and the process ahead of time means one less thing you need to try and do during the process. Plus if you don't remember what something means, you have a reference source to go back to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSlicing Pie by Mike Moyer\n\nThis is less about fundraising as it is about attributing equity for non-monetary contributions. However, I bring it up here because the majority of failed startups I've seen have failed not due to fundraising, but due to team issues. A philosophy on how equity will be attributed \\*before\\* any money comes into play would have saved the majority of them. I've always been a fan of Dynamic Equity Allocations, and this book does a great job of taking what was once an exotic financial engineering concept, and making it accessible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, not as much a resource as a strong suggestion: *Network*. Network. **Network**.\n\nMeetups, Conferences, Social Events at Co-working spaces. I can't put enough emphasis on the value of spontaneous serendipity in the success of a startup, nor can I count the number of times i've been describing a project to a stranger in response to \"What are you working on?\" where at some point in the conversation (or a future conversation) they've presented me with:\n\n\"A guy who's really into \\*insert relevant topic\\*\" or,\n\n\"A fund that's interested in that space right now\" or.\n\nasked \"If I've had a chance to speak with \\*insert name of individual at company in space\\*.\"\n\nFor a lot of people, networking is exhausting, and there's always things you think need to take priority. You already work hard on your startup. You've just taken to attaching entire stacks of post-it notes to your agile board, but never seem to move them. You haven't seen your kids or wife/husband or girlfriend/boyfriend in 3 days. You can't remember what soap smells like.\n\nWhen life is like this, prioritizing cleaning yourself up and going and having a few beers with a bunch of strangers can not just seem daunting, but also be hard to justify to the family you're likely already neglecting, and to yourself.\n\nJust remember that nobody invests in a company they don't know about. Nobody trusts a team they've never met and nobody's ever heard of. At some point you'll need to do this anyway, and it's not something that can be rushed. The sooner you start building that network, the larger it will be when the time comes to let people know that you're about to start raising financing, or looking for employees, or need advice.\n\nAnd who knows, you might just make some friends and have some fun along the way.",

Some third world countries don\u2019t allow tiered shareholdings, in which case you often see financing structured as tiered debt which gets paid out in a similar way. (Think about having to take our second and third mortgages on a house.) However even there, rules and structures are harmonizing. \n\nYou\u2019ll see it in every industry as well. If anyone\u2019s ever needed someone to give them money when money was rare, it\u2019s safe to say there\u2019s a legal mechanism to make sure they get their investment and profit out first. \n\nThat being said, the exact format of your term sheet will vary greatly depending on jurisdiction, as might the names of common clauses. Some jurisdictions may not allow for multiples, although I can\u2019t think of a specific example of one off the top of my head. However almost universally, at some point in the investment process with a professional or institutional investor, you\u2019ll receive something that lays out valuation and terms of investment. When you see that, start looking for words like Preferred Shares, Fully Participating Stock, and #x preference. That\u2019ll be where your liquidation preference is outlined. \n\nThe major exception I can think of is very early stage Triple F investors. Generally at this point you don\u2019t have a lot of money for legal, so you just issue them Common. \n\nHowever now that you\u2019ve read the above, you might have ideas of other sorts of shares you could offer them and ask your lawyer about! \n\n",

I\u2019ve also had my share of catastrophic failures, and am sitting on stakes in a number of ventures which could go either way. But overall I\u2019ve made more money than I\u2019ve lost, and I\u2019ve been fortunate in that I\u2019ve never had a personal venture implode once I\u2019ve taken outside money, so all of my friends and family still call me at Christmas time. \n\nPart of that is that I don\u2019t raise money until I\u2019m absolutely convinced the venture will work, and that generally means I need to bleed a lot personally because I put off the seed round as long as possible. It also means I retain a lot more of my startups when the time comes to raise though.\n\nA lot of ideas look good on paper (See the 201X craze of \u201cIt\u2019s Facebook/Uber/eBay/Whatever... for China!\u201d), but transitioning the business model is never as straightforward as it appears. \n\nI think there\u2019s been a lot of success with the localization of proven businesses provided that you are a local importing a foreign business model. The key to the success of these businesses is understanding the local customs and culture, and identifying or adapting the proven model to work.\n\nCultures are extremely different in very subtle ways, and therefore differences in the way people communicate, buy, travel, interact, and show prestige/value are easy to gloss over or not fully understand for a foreigner who just assumes that it\u2019s the same as their country. That\u2019s one of the reasons why a lot of larger companies have difficulty gaining traction in foreign markets, and end up seeking out local partners. \n\nConversely, just because you understand the local environment doesn\u2019t mean you understand the business. Ride Share/social media/whatever may as straight forward a concept as it seems, so understanding the complications and challenges that the successful companies encountered is important to make sure that your venture can overcome them. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking to Export a business model, make sure you have team members who are local partners, or intimately familiar with the local culture of the region you\u2019re exporting to. If you plan on Importing, make sure someone on your team is an expert in the business or model you\u2019re planning on importing. Your backers are ultimately going to want to see both. ",

That\u2019s a great start. The first two questions you need to ask are:\n\nWhy? It\u2019s a big one. Are there any relevant regulations that prevent it? Is it too expensive? Does it require technology that isn\u2019t popular or widely available? Sometimes there\u2019s a good reason it hasn\u2019t taken off locally. \n\nDoes it really not exist? A lot of the time other people have tried it already, and are either pre-launch but ahead of you, or they\u2019ve failed. In either case, you need to spend a lot of time looking into this point, and reach out to anyone you find to see what happened or how it\u2019s going with their project. One of my current projects actually formed this way, with my discovering a direct competitor who was two steps ahead of us, reaching out and setting up a meeting, and coming away from it having decided to merge our teams. \n\nIf you make it through these two steps, then it\u2019s a matter of building your team and refining your idea. While you\u2019re doing that, learn as much about the services you wish to replicate as possible. You might even consider reaching out to them and discussing local expansion. Bigger entities have expansion plans, and a capable local partner reaching out can help accelerate those plans, and perhaps put you in place to be part of them. \n\nThere are lots of ways to form/join a startup. Sometimes it\u2019s a matter of creating a job for yourself at an existing one by making a market for them that doesn\u2019t exist without you. ",

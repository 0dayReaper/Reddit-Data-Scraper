    "postText": "Working on a startup as one of two cofounders. We will both be building MVP together but I\u2019m mostly responsible for GTM and finding customers. I have no problem building prospect lists, already have a large set of specific ICP prospects compiled in excel. Would it be worth getting a hubspot /salesloft/ outreach solution now or just work from my big ol excel file? Prospects are SMB and will be heavy cold call +email for outbound motion.\n\nFor timing, I\u2019m holding off until we have at least a good estimate of MVP release date, I\u2019d like to be able to say \u201cyou\u2019ll be able to onboard in approximately X-weeks.\u201d We\u2019ve talked with a few potential customers already and have a good feel for what\u2019s needed. Waiting for a realistic release deadline feels better than \u201cmaybe in a few months. MVP is not coded yet, but it\u2019s wireframed/templated and will start being developed in next few days.\n\nWe have day-jobs at the moment, which is why we can\u2019t commit to a deadline until we have some decent progress on the build, hard to gauge how fast we\u2019ll build with that limitation.",

Even if you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re launching, spend every minute you can talking to customers. If you don\u2019t have anything to sell them yet, become friends with them so they\u2019ll feel pressure to buy faster later.",

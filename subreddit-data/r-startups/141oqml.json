Most techies cant communicate very well with non-techies, that's why we as technical cofounders need to be able to translate for other stakeholders.\n\nThere are different ways to approach this, in your position i would probably do a few high-level workshops with them to fill the specific gaps they have. You can explain a lot about processes with legos for example. \n\nAnother good way for explaining dev processes is with a team-based writing thought experiment. Assume you are a team of writers collaborating on multiple novels at the same time. Start with a simple example, then expand. \"What happens if we want to reuse text blocks across multiple novels? What if we want to reuse paragraphs or even chapters? How do we consolidate a single writing voice with multiple authors? How can we manage multiple versions?\"\n\nIt sounds like you want something for more detailed tech terminology, maybe a simple glossary would suffice. On the other hand, maybe they should just ask in the moment (KISS).",

    "postText": "Seeking advice on incorporation before revenue.\n\nWe are 3 person team that is still building MVP and have no user or revenue. We are bootstrapping without salary.\n\nI am paying all the relevant costs out of pocket and I am thinking to incorporate Delaware-C using Stripe Altas as my other founders are international nationals. I think there might be some benefits to putting these expenses separately.\n\nHowever, I heard that I will need to file taxes and annual financial reports so I am not sure how much additional expense I should expect.  Do I need to hire a CPA to do them?\n\nIs it worthwhile or I should incorporate it if I have some revenue?\n\nCan anyone share some pros and cons? Much appreciated",

            "comment": "Do you have a founder\u2019s agreement? Is your intention to be equal owners? If you are developing an MVP how are you handling IP, specifically IP assignment. If you are filing provisional patents or utilizing trade secrets then IMO you should incorporate pre-revenue to have clear ownership of IP vested in the Company. This is particularly important to show investors that the Company owns the IP and cannot be held hostage by a rogue founder. If you aren\u2019t at the point of considering filing for protection then it is less critical to incorporate but you must have a Founder\u2019s agreement spelling out rights obligations and ownership percentages if not equal if you don\u2019t already.",

Incorporation is really having to do with equity as only a company can dole out stock.  Once you incorporate, yes you will have to pay taxes or a business fee.  So there rally is no reason until you really have to.",

Considering you have Non-U.S. founder having LLC would also require you to file Form 5472 with the IRS. We have helped clients in similar situation. It's pretty straightforward.\n\nThanks, Happy to answer any further questions.\n\nDisclaimer - this is not tax or legal advice.",

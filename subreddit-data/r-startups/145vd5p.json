    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI am seeking a salaried startup job. I am a repeat founder. I seek a stable income and need a break from starting my own thing. I am applying to stuff but not getting much luck. I have a lot of startup skills and experience in tech, product, sales, and marketing. I am a bit of a jack of trades. \n\nDo you have any tips on landing a startup job through an untraditional route? If I got an interview and showed some of my work it would be easy to demonstrate my value. \n\nI am not getting much luck applying to tech work. I would like to work in product but I have no formal experience in product. \n\nThanks for your help",

I\u2019ve done engineering, product, marketing, sales, operations, and strategy. \n\nMy best hack is go to all your local VC firms, find a way to get some time, and then let them know what you\u2019re looking for. Be specific about stage, role, people, etc. Ask for introductions. \n\nVC firms are always looking for great people that have experience for their portfolio companies. They have a thing about trying to keep them in their portfolios too, so if there are investors you\u2019ve worked with previously who may know you, that\u2019s even better.\n\nAsk them to connect you, and you\u2019ll have to network your way in. \n\nThat said, this is just about the worst time since probably the tech bubble in 2001 to be looking for a job in tech. Everyone is doing RIFs and have likely frozen hiring. \n\nIt\u2019s tough out there\u2026good luck!",

You should be getting more callbacks.\n\nFirst off, you need one vastly different resume per job type you're applying to (product manager being one). Put that title in bold letter at the top of your resume.\n\nTrim EVERYTHING that detracts from that job title. Think really hard to find 1-5 things in each job that applies to the new role. Drop all the rest from your resume\n\nIt will feel uncomfortable at first to trim so much, but try it. Nothing to lose. At the same time keep in mind that Product is very competitive these days. \n\n&gt; Jack of all trades\n\nMost companies hate that, unless the role requires it  manager can somewhat work here).",

Pick the things you found to be the most valuable from your varied skills/accomplishments and put them into your resume. (i.e. Was it the business / P&amp;L / fundraising side or the product development / UX / software engineering side?) The hiring manager looking for those skills will notice them and give you an interview. Then apply to 1,000 jobs (it's a rule of large numbers game). Apply to earlier stage startups or smaller teams within large companies. Note that FAANG type companies will most likely hire laterally from people who are laid off from other FAANG companies so maybe avoid those, but you can still apply if you want. Rule of large numbers guarantees success. you can't just apply to 60 jobs and expect to hear back in this market environment. It literally has to be like 20 jobs a day until you start getting interviews. Until you know exactly where you might fit in best, it's best to apply to a varied assortment of jobs and see what clicks. It's as much a journey about learning about you as it is about the company.\n\n(2) Reach out to your network / post on LinkedIn that you are looking. Some people are more comfortable with this approach versus the apply to 1,000 companies approach. I have less to say here but I know some founders would write about what they learned about their previous startups publicly and then say at the bottom that they're looking for the next adventure which markets that they are available and ready to work.",

It's tough out there.\n\nThis may not help you land a job soon, or make up for a lack of traditional resume line items, but consider going deep in one of the core disciplines. Being an expert in sales or marketing is a good way to mitigate risk.\n\nThe great thing about engineering is that you can make things to show off and include it in your resume. If it's super relevant to the candidate company, it might pique someone's interest. It's not likely that sample projects will put you in line ahead of 100 other applicants, but stranger things have happened.\n\nKeep at it. Good luck!",

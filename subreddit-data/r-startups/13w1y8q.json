I'm interested in finding some great instructional books on startup business model design, marketing, sales, or any related topics that rely heavily on visual aids. Some people are visual learners and do find that visualizations and diagrams really help them to better understand complex concepts. Can anyone recommend any books that would fit this bill? I'm open to any and all suggestions! Thanks in advance for your help.",

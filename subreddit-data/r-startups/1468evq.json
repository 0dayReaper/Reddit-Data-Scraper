    "postText": "A little background of me, I have an idea to create foot scanner for diabetics foot.\n\nAfter talking with doctors and learned some Arduino, I have a better picture of what kind of prototype that I want to have.\n\nFor starter, I know that for the prototype can be built using off the shelf parts ( and some 3D printing). It's basically camera, stepper motor /dc motor, and servos affixed to some physical frame.\n\nMy friends suggested me to contact local university/ college and hire some students. But I have some questions before I do that.\n\n1. Who to contact? Do I reach to the professor/ faculty?\n2. How much to pay the student? How do I find the going rate for students?\n3. Pros / cons of working with students? My fear is that the student get distracted or lose interest. Although, technically speaking this may apply to anyone.\n4. How professional should my business look? Do I need a website, logo, etc prior to contacting the university? I try to keep expenses low, but I understand there is a certain image I need to maintain.\n5. Anything else that I need to be aware of?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Anything else that I need to be aware of?\n\nAs soon as you validate your prototype, get a professional to redo your product. \n\nI work for a saas product that was prototyped by college students. They never rebuilt the product but kept adding to it. Now it's a pile of mess that cannot be scaled. Also cannot get any decent professional to join the company.",

Then you will be delayed for a month.\n\nYou need to find someone either yor friends or colleagues or someone in your network etc to be your technical cofounder. Otherwise, You will just hope your employee knows what they are doing.",

Figure out other ways of paying. For instance, sharing equity. Students should be studying. Building hardware is expensive. If you're not ready to pay people, you're not ready to start a company.",

I'm also exploring how much I need to pay.\n\nI talked to a professional prototype firm and they ask outright 20k.\nI'm sure they will be useful when I get into the final prototype. However I want to get a lot more product feedback before I take that plunge.\n\nSo systemically I'm gathering all info. That includes students and professionals too.",

We use a firm called Nottingham Spirks out of Ohio, we looked at a bunch of design firms and they were relatively reasonable. Your idea is probably sound.  I would find a university with a biomed program, and offer a small prize to build the product you need.  Graduating engineers always have a senior project, and you could offer a 1k prize to the whole class.  There are caveats of course, chief among them is the IP release.  But if you can make it a condition for your mini X-prize.  I would start here, but remember clinical trials or even office use can be complex to navigate (Think IRB etc.)  So first pass x prize for working prototype, then something intermediate, and finally with feedback, a commercially ready prototype.  Think NASA, with mercury, gemini and apollo.  Each phase gets better and closer to commercialization.  Good Luck.",

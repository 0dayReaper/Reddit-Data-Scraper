    "postText": "I am building a product that should hit market in less than 6 weeks. I am a senior developer myself and has 2 developer friends ready to help. I have no money to pay them, so how do I compensate them?\n\nI do not want to split it 3 ways because after it is built there's going to be a lot of business related work that I will do myself and I will have to bring in investors in the future. \n\nMy question is, how would I make it their while to help me? Do I give them fewer percentages that will vest in the future based on the work they do? Or do I pay them once the business starts making money? Or do I do something else?\n\nEdit\n\nI am fairly close to them and they will work for next to nothing. But I don't want to be that person.",

Oftentimes unless you're on equal footing the dynamics of the friendship will change greater than it's worth. Devs are abundant, get some revenue and hire people.",

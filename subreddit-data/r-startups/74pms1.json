    "postText": "*I was reviewing some notes from 1-1 meetings that me and my manager Dave used to have, and I thought I'd summarize a bunch of the repeated talking points we've had over the years. Here's some of what I've learned about being a competent professional.*\n\n# Identify and focus on your top priorities \u2013 because if you don't, wtf are you doing?\n\n**Is the top priority the top priority?** What's the single most important thing you need to be doing? If you don't have an answer to this, you should drop everything and figure out what the answer is. Having an answer here forces clarity and focus. Not having an answer is dangerous \u2013 it guarantees that you'll be working on unimportant things and wasting your precious time.\n\nThere will always be an endless stream of things to do. It'll be tempting to do whatever is easiest, or most fun, or most familiar. But this is a trap that will screw you over in the long run. It's better to make 5-10% progress on the most important thing than to finish lots of tasks that don't actually move the needle.\n\n**What are you accountable for?** Everybody in an organization should own something. Ideally, it should be a metric that is tied to your top priority.  If it isn't, you should discuss it with your manager or boss and establish what your top priority really is. Once you've settled on a metric (and you usually need to have some sort of counter-balancing metric, to try and mitigate the problem of perverse incentives), you'll want to make sure that you know as much as possible about how to make a positive dent in this metric. \n\n**Dominate your area of responsibility.** You want to be really good at the thing that you're supposed to be handling. Sounds kinda obvious, but sometimes it can be tempting to try to do a bunch of secondary things. Go back to point 1 \u2013 keep the main thing the main thing.\n\n**Make your goals and targets precise.** If things are vague or ambiguous, set aside time to make them precise. Don't work with ambiguous plans \u2013 it's a recipe for distraction and scope creep. Learn to identify vagueness in your own thinking, writing and communications, and weed it out.\n\n# Manage yourself like an important, valuable resource \u2013 because you are\n\n&gt; \"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.\" \u2013 Richard Feynman\n\n**Be honest about what you don't know.** Be honest with yourself, most importantly. The clearer you are about this, the better positioned you will be to learn and improve. As a bonus, you'll find that being intellectually honest in a candid way encourages people to be honest with you in turn. It just makes for a healthy atmosphere. Practice communicating your uncertainty in a constructive, inviting way. It's refreshing to be around people like that.\n\n**Have a schedule and respect it.** I hated calendars and timetables as a kid, and spent many years dealing with subconscious stress of having to deal with any sort of deadline. But truths are true whether we like them or not: We have limited time and an unlimited set of things to do. In the absence of good routines, we fall into bad ones. If you're not deciding in advance how you're going to spend your time and energy, then other things will decide for you \u2013 the urgency of an interruption from somebody, the ease of an unimportant task. This compounds.\n\nAfter years of reflection and oscillation, I came to realize that my issue wasn't with schedules per se \u2013 it was with being forced to do things that I didn't want to do. I just subconsciously had a negative association with calendars, due dates and so on. If you're like me, this takes a lot of work to undo. Start by making really small, simple plans and then get them done. Write down something that you can do in 5 minutes, then do it, and scratch it off. Do this over and over and get better at it, and add more time. It gets more complex as it gets larger, like a video game. It's actually quite interesting and exciting once you reframe it this way. You learn a lot more about yourself and the world around you.\n\n**Take time off.** You are a resource and you need to recharge. Don't burn out. Think long term. When I started working, I felt like I was given an opportunity I didn't deserve. I didn't feel qualified. I felt like I was always behind on my work. So I kept deferring and postponing when I'd eventually take a vacation. On retrospect, this was a hilariously bad idea, and I regret it. I would have been happier, healthier, and have gotten much more done if I simply bit the bullet and scheduled my time off in advance.\n\n**Reflect and review on your past work.** Analyze your past work to figure out what worked, what didn't, what went well, what didn't... you should be doing this regularly, on your own. I've always been a little bit sloppy with this \u2013 I don't always take notes, and when I do, I don't always review them. If I could start over again, I would work to be more systematic and disciplined about this.( I'm writing this blogpost now because I was reviewing my 1-1 doc.)\n\n**Articulate your processes.** This is helpful at multiple levels. First of all, simply taking something out of your brain and putting it on paper is an incredibly useful habit. It forces you to figure out what you really mean. What are you trying to achieve? How do you make decisions? When you articulate your processes, you can analyze them. You can look for weak points and improve them. It's like watching a replay of yourself. You can share your processes with others, and get feedback.\n\n**You are in charge of yourself.** Even if you have great managers, you ultimately need to take responsibility for your own learning, your own execution, your own growth. Looking back, I think I spent most of my first 3-4 years in a sort of reactive mode (rather than proactive). I did have great managers who gave me lots of great targets, advice, context, structure and so on. And maybe they even spoiled me a little, because it took me a few years to think, \"Well, damn, I gotta set loftier goals for myself, and meet them.\" Unless you have a crazy boss or manager, nobody is going to push you as hard as you can push yourself. (I don't mean overwork yourself in terms of number of hours, I mean challenge yourself in terms of pushing yourself out of your comfort zone. Trying new things, learning new things that are outside your immediate job scope, etc.)\n\n**Set aside time for learning.** When you find good content about your field, bookmark it for later, and go through it at a regular interval. Weekly is pretty good. If you're doing a bunch of reading and learning, share your findings with someone else. This helps you understand. Implement your learnings. Set monthly and quarterly goals.\n\n# Always take pains to communicate effectively \u2013 your impact on your team members is highly consequential\n\n**Communicate early, communicate often.** In my earlier days, I was often self-conscious and trying to figure out everything by myself. If I owed somebody something, I tried to figure out everything and get it all done first before passing it on. If I ran into any difficulties, I would either go a little nuts, or I'd procrastinate until I didn't have much time left, and then get it done in a panic. Show your work. Share your sketches and drafts. You need to build trust and rapport with your team so you can feel comfortable doing this. Early-stage feedback is much more useful and actionable than late-stage feedback. Sometimes simply asking a few questions or chatting about something in an open-ended way can lead to superior ideas and solutions that you didn't expect.\n\n**Ask clarifying questions.** Everything is vague to a degree you don't realize. So make an effort to make things precise. Being clear about exactly what is expected is very important. People having different expectations, different understandings of a situation, interpreting vague instructions differently, etc \u2013 all of these are sources of lots of friction and frustration. So it's worth spending a lot of time and energy making sure everyone is aligned on whatever you're doing.\n\n**Lean on your team; ask for help.** Real life isn't a closed-book examination, where you have to get everything done right yourself, in isolation. Ask for help if you need it. This may vary a little depending on your company culture and personality. Some people might be intrusive and demanding. But I generally get the sense that smart, respectful people tend to err on the side of caution \u2013 not wanting to interrupt others. That said, when you ask for help, be simple and clear about it. \"Hey, when you have a moment \u2013 I need some fresh eyes to look at my slides for a few minutes and offer copy suggestions\". Don't interrupt people with open-ended non-requests, that's disrespectful. Give people a very clear ask, and sometimes they'll even be grateful for the brief distraction + chance to help move something along.\n\n**Be encouraging and supportive.** It makes a difference. It can make all the difference.\n\n# Always Be Peopling \u2013 organizations and industries are made of people; build relationships with them\n\n**Always be networking.** It's easy to fall into a pattern of thinking that you need to focus on whatever's in front of your face. There's always going to be more work to do. You need to be able to zoom in and out. Meet people who are in similar roles as you, doing work similar to what you're doing. This will help you do your job better. And it's also quite pleasurable and heartening in its own right, for its own sake.\n**\nPeople know things.** They will tell you things in person that they won't ever write in a blogpost or post online \u2013 and these will be some of the most powerful, useful things for you to know. They can open doors for you. They can set things up for you. Sometimes the problem you've been struggling with for weeks or months has a simple solution, and that solution happens to be inside somebody's head \u2013 that you can access for the cost of a beer or coffee.\n\n**Have a pipeline for hiring.** Even if you aren't responsible for hiring decisions. Make a list of people you'd like to work with and learn from. It makes sense to build relationships with people for the long haul. It's good to know good people even if you aren't necessarily going to make a career in any particular industry.\n\n**Practice speaking, give talks, presentations, etc.** Communicating what you know with other people is a powerful skill. It will make you a better professional. And you'll feel lighter at work, too, because the act of teaching and sharing makes you more comfortable and confident in your area of expertise.\n\n# Miscellaneous thoughts\n\n**Identify your constraints.** Is it money? Is it ideas? Is it execution? Is it time? What's stopping you from making 2x, 5x, 10x the impact you are currently achieving?\n\n**Thought experiments can be really useful.** What if you had more resources to spend? What would you do with an additional $500 a week to spend? $1,000? $2,000? $5,000? What if you had to start over from scratch, what would you do differently? What if you could only work for half the number of hours you currently work? What are the opportunity costs of what you're doing? What would happen if you did the complete opposite of whatever you're doing? \n\n**Positioning exercises are useful in marketing.** In many ways, marketing is all about positioning. Why should anybody buy this product instead of anything else (or nothing at all)? Why should anybody care about some particular piece of content? Why should anybody hire you? What do you, your content, your skills, etc bring to the table?\n\n**Study job postings.** I avoided doing this for a long time, because I love where I am and it felt a little bit scandalous to even entertain the thought. But it's very useful to know what the job market is looking for. You can plan a career this way. Look up the job descriptions of roles senior to your own, and ask yourself what you can or cannot do. And then build out those skill-sets. Protip: This is also precisely how you work yourself into promotions and raises.\n\n**Take ownership.** Make it easy for your boss to say yes. Every boss fantasizes about having an employee that just shows up and gets things done without having to be told or micromanaged. Once you're both clear about your priorities, goals and targets, figure out a plan and get it done. Your boss hired you to do a job, she doesn't want to have to go over every single decision with you (though a good boss will do this for a while \u2013 teach a man to fish, etc). Do the thinking for her, and give her easy decisions to say yes to. (Eg: \"We are currently paying A freelancers $B to get content that gives us C traffic, which leads to D signups. If we doubled down on A1, we would get more signups for less cost.\")\n\n**Move fast; go all the way through.** I find myself thinking about writing and music. Ray Bradbury had a quote about how a writer \"should be a thing of fevers and enthusiasms.\" Orchestra conductor Benjamin Zander has a similar point about how musicians should \"stop thinking about every single note along the way, and start thinking about the long, long line from (start to finish).\" I've grown to believe that this is true for all sorts of work. \n\n**Take care of your mental and emotional health.** Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, so it's a good idea to do it well, to take it seriously, to enjoy it, to challenge yourself and so on. But if you find yourself getting burnt out, depressed and so on, don't lie to yourself about it. You are the most important person in your life; take care of yourself. \n\n____\n\n*You can [hit me up on Twitter]\n(http://www.twitter.com/visakanv) if you like.

                    "comment": "Okay so let's say for some reason I decided that I wanted to switch to a BizDev role. First thing I do is I look up some job descriptions:\n\nhttps://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/recruiting-hiring-advice/job-descriptions/business-development-manager-job-description-sample.aspx\n\nRight, so it's basically (to oversimplify) being a partnerships manager. It's all about building relationships across potential partners in a particular industry. (For me, I already work in SaaS company that sells an ecommerce marketing product, so I would pick that \u2013 but barring that, I would pick something that interested me, and/or I thought was lucrative.)\n\nAs a writer, the first thing I'd do is start a blog, and pen my thoughts about some existing partnerships. What are the ones that are good, what are the ones that were not so good? What are some partnerships that don't exist, that should exist? I'll start going to YouTube and look for videos of biz dev folks giving talks. I'll take notes and write posts about those, then tweet/email those folks thanking them for the talk + asking to buy them coffee. Sincere flattery always works. After that, ask them if they need help with anything, help them, use that as leverage when looking to get hired. \n\nFundamentally, it's about doing a lot of reading about the subject matter, figuring out what are all the questions that are typically asked, reaching out to people who are already involved, ask them for advice and suggestions. Repeat this process recursively.\n\nAnother way of approaching the problem is:\n\n&gt; I've always been stuck due to lack of experience \n\nWhy would the company you want not hire an inexperienced biz-dev person? Because they don't know if they can trust you to achieve results. So maybe try to set something up when you're pitching. \n\nAlso, generally, I advise people to work for startups. Startup founders will pick a scrappy, motivated and hungry person \u2013 and it definitely makes it much easier to say yes if you offer to do a little free work to prove your worth. (Of course, do your homework to make sure that the startup founder you're talking to isn't an exploitative asshole who'll take advantage of you)",

He was a complete unknown to them, so he removed the risk for the company. Normal learning curve in this company is 1-2 years for PHD in physics. This guy took 2-3 years on the learning curve. However, at every step of the way he made himself very useful on non-physics stuff, so there was never any thought about not keeping him. \n\nWorking free is a personal decision.

It's easy to get a \"yes\" from a group of losers going nowhere. But for most startups, adding an incompetent stranger into their mix could be incredibly devastating for a number of reasons.\n\nMy advice: go out and do that which you want to do. Want to build up a resume for ops and partnerships? Start running events. Events are all about partnerships, and you don't need ANY infrastructure in place to run them if you can develop the necessary partnerships. Once you have a few events under your belt, add some operational complexity that requires you to effectively manage volunteers and delegate responsibility. Then you can even try and get some sponsors.\n\nIn 3-6 months, if you really do this well, you could have some impressive results and a much stronger network.",

If you are, chances are you're doing things that are really simple, predictable and formulaic \u2013 and you should probably be working towards something more complex.\n\nOne way of thinking about it is \u2013 it's about making little bets or predictions. If tasks take longer than you expect, then start revising your estimations accordingly. Break down big tasks into smaller tasks. \n\nEg \"Clean the house\" might seem like it should take 6 hours, but when you start doing it you realize that you could actually do it for days and days. So you need to get more precise. What is the extent of 'done-ness' that is okay? Break it down into all the separate rooms. Clean bedroom, clean kitchen, clean toilet. Have substeps for each \u2013 vacuum, mop, etc. The more granular you get, the easier it is to figure out how long it'll take (eg 5-10 minutes).\n\nStart with these really small things, and over time you'll get better at seeing how they all add up into the big picture",

Because you did the \"pre-work\" of planning your work. It's kind of like doing math on paper instead of in your head. It seems like it wouldn't make a huge difference, but it always does.\n\n&gt; Haha, seems I also totally need to come to terms with the fact that not everything needs to have 100% doness to be complete. I'm pretty perfectionist and that totally throws my schedules for a loop.\n&gt; \n\nYup. You could think of it as having 'scales of done-ness\". Eg if your friends are coming over for dinner, you're going to clean up whatever visible mess there is, but you're probably not going to clean the top of your ceiling fan or vacuum under the carpet. Knowing what degree of done-ness is required for the task allows you to breathe easier and budget your time better. Doing 10 important tasks well-enough is way better than obsessing over perfection for one task.\n\nMight be worth writing a whole separate post about this...",

I kind of do it in fragments. I periodically just write down everything that's on my mind. Sometimes I use Workflowy, or Notes on my Mac, or Evernote if I'm on mobile... if I'm in a really bad spot, I use pen and paper. I have a todo app called Things, which is pretty nifty. But all of these are just tools, it doesn't really matter what tool you use. What matters is that you use it regularly. Write everything down every day. \n\nI don't really know if there's any way to speed up this habit acquisition... but basically when in doubt just review everything. I sometimes think of it like a video game dashboard",

You assumed wrong.\n\nAgain, if you want a sub to reflect what you want you are welcome to start your own.\n\nThat's how Reddit is designed.\n\n-----\n\n&gt; Didn't realize it was just a bunch of guys doing whatever they feel like, including being a jackass a lot of the time, like you are.\n\nWhile it may seem the way to you, we actually have a rather cohesive experiential goal we are constantly working towards.\n\nOne that our rules reflect.  \n\nDue to the high volume of posts to this sub, rules are often enforced in a robotic or frustrated nature.  Often, people are choosing to ignore them for their own selfish gain.  I have little patience for that.\n\nAgain, if you can not handle that you are welcome to start your own sub.",

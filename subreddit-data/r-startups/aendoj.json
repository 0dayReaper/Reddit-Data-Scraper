    "postText": "Hello r/entrepreneur and r/startups! One of my co-founders u/millionaire_ made a quick [AMA a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/ad6ht3/thinking_about_doing_an_amamaybe_this_will_be_it/) which seemed to get a lot of interest. I wanted to expand on some of  the successes he talked about and make a few posts around our marketing  strategies! If you haven't feel free to check out the AMA he did. There are some useful nuggets in there :).  \nI've been following the r/entrepreneur and r/startups\u00a0for  the past 4 years and have received some amazing advice, read some great  stories, and have contributed some of my knowledge here and there. I started my company a little over 3 years ago and have had great mentors along the way. Now I would like to give back a little and share some of  my own experiences.  \n**Background**  \n\n\nI\u2019m one of 3 founders. We\u2019ve grown our company to 20+ employees, 2 outstanding products, millions of dollars of revenue, and an 8 figure  valuation. We have a long ways to go and still have a lot to learn.  Every day is a grind and we\u2019re all putting in about 10 hours a day. Are we burnt out? Not even close. We have a huge opportunity in front of us  and we\u2019re all on the same page as to what our vision is.  \n\n\nI'd  like to make a post every week going over different platform algorithms, destroying competition, understanding how to monetize your market, high level marketing, and much more! I'll start this first post off with a bang and cover some key things to consider in the competitive marketing landscape.  \n\n\n**Marketing 101!**  \n\n\nSales and marketing are arguably the 2 most important things in business. They go hand in hand. If you have a product market fit and test enough marketing tactics, you will find tactics that work for your business. This allows you to scale a business at an extremely fast rate. Really understanding your metrics, customer's needs, retention, and other factors are key for any growing company. There are a few things that you need to consider before marketing.  \n\n\n**1. Who are your target customers?**  \n\n\n**2. Where do your target customers go?**  \n\n\n**3. Who are the decision makers from these companies and where do they go? (For B2B)**  \n\n\n**4. Who do your potential customers currently work with? (Their existing relationships)**  \n\n\n**5. Where do those existing relationships go?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n**Who are your target customers?**  \n\n\nIdentifying your target customer is very important. For my company, we focus primarily on home service companies. There are thousands of home service companies so we narrowed down to home service companies who have  websites. Then it turned into focusing on plumbing, HVAC, and electrical companies. Next, how do we know a company can afford marketing or technology products? We narrowed down to companies who have at least 5 service technicians. As we grew, we started to focus on companies who have 10+ technicians. Larger companies tend to be more stable, willing to spend more, and are easier to retain and build a relationship with. If they have between 5-9 technicians they should be spending money on  Google ads, Facebook ads, billboards, etc. If not, we don't waste our  time, or their time.   \n\n\nThis was just the beginning and how we started with our first product which was a lead gen product. As we grew an ancillary AI chat product that can cater to multiple industries, we expanded our target market with similar requirements. Now we target home service companies, dental practices, medical practices, attorneys, real estate companies, home builders, and larger enterprise deals.  \n\n\nIt's important to pinpoint who your target customer is so that you don't waste time and money on the wrong people. Your target customer might change as time goes on (it definitely has for us). Be mindful of deals that you are closing and try to recognize similarities between them all.  \n\n\n**Where do your potential customers go? Primarily the decision makers!**  \n\n\nFirst  you need to identify who the decision makers are from the company! In our case, the decision makers for both of our products are typically the marketing managers and sometimes the owners/CEOs. It's not always the CEO so be mindful of this. So where do we reach these people?  \n\n\n**Are they on Facebook?**  \n\n\n**Are they on Instagram?**  \n\n\n**Are they on Reddit? (Most of our clients don't even know what Reddit is haha)**  \n\n\n**Are they on LinkedIn?**  \n\n\n**Do they check their emails? How do we even get their emails?!**  \n\n\n**How can we get in front of them in person?**  \n\n\n**How do they make their purchasing decisions? Online, in person, via demos...**  \n\n\nThese  are all questions you need to ask yourself. A lot of times you will know where your target customer DOES NOT go, so you can eliminate those from the list. For example, a lot of our customers are 40+ years old and have very specific purchasing patterns. Because of this, we didn't invest our time into marketing on Instagram.  \n\n\nFor  us, our most successful marketing campaigns come from in person events, email marketing, LinkedIn marketing (paid and organic), and retargeting on Facebook.  \n\n\nTrade shows and conferences are huge for us. We typically bring 5 people from our team to have 2 people at our booth and the other 3 running around the event grounds talking to ANYONE THEY CAN. Clients, other vendors for partnerships, manufactures, literally anyone. We close deals on the spot, schedule demos for the upcoming weeks, and begin partnership conversations. Not only that, but people start to recognize our brand.  \n\n\nAfter the event, we had collect so many emails, schedule meetings, and always purchase the event email list if we could. This is used to email market and our sales team would call everyone and say something like \"we were the booth with the nerf guns and gave away the free bags.\"  By the way, free bags at events are HUGE because everyone becomes a walking billboard for you. ;)  \n\n\nNow that they have seen us in person, we would add EVERYONE on LinkedIn (if  they had one) and set up some paid LinkedIn ads to the companies in attendance.  \n\n\nThen we set up some basic Facebook retarget ads so they are seeing us everywhere for the next month. All of this makes the sales team's job much easier when they are calling the potential customers. Everyone is basically a warm lead at this point knowing we are a legit brand/product. We close multiple deals per day, per rep in the coming weeks after an event.  \n\n\n**Who do your potential customers currently work with? (Their existing relationships)**  \n\n\nNow  that we're closing a lot of 'one off deals', we would think... \"how do  we 10x our growth\"? What's slowing us down? With our AI chatbot, we install on a website, so during every sales conversation, we would have to get in front of the agency who controls their website. BOOM. \"WE HAVE TO BUILD PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE AGENCIES.\" They are the ones who control the websites. How do we incentive them and speed up our growth? This was the start of our channel sales/marketing strategy. Give the agencies a revenue share to sell to their existing clients. We are very generous  with our revenue share, and we have the best product in the market so it's a no brainer for both parties.  \n\n\nNow instead of closing 10 deals a week, we can close 50-100+ because of our channel partners. Our dev team built the backend and we made the  process as simple as possible for all of our partners. Now we're writing checks for tens of thousands of dollars to our partners every month. Better than spending it on marketing and investing in massive sales teams. Our main focus has become growth through channel partners. We have a small sales team and our margin is higher with them, but we grow  faster through our partners.  \n\n\nSide note... This mentality can be translated to B2C through influencer marketing. Who are your consumers following? Instagram models are making a living for getting paid to feature certain products. YouTubers also  get paid to more money than their CPMs to feature products on their channel. If you can find the right people, it works like a charm.  \n\n\n**Where do those existing relationships go?**  \n\n\nIn our situation, LINKEDIN is a goldmine. Not just from a standpoint of adding/messaging, but we pay for LinkedIn ads ever day. Once you add their decision makers on LinkedIn, start doing more paid ads, more organic posts showcasing top clients, the snowball effect begins. We try to schedule as many calls per week with agencies to get them reselling our product. We also meet a lot of people in person at our events so those conversations become pretty easy. Eventually, the agencies started messaging us.  \n\n\nFor larger partners, it's pretty standard to fly out to meet in person and get terms hashed out.  \n\n\nAgain, for B2C, your potential customers might be spending hours on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, etc. Influencer marketing works really well and can  get a massive return.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------  \n\n\nThis is my mindset for marketing. Who are the target companies, who makes the decisions, and how do I get in front of them? The ideology is pretty simple and just all about executing and making things happen!  \n\n\nAny questions of feedback would be appreciated! Hope this has helped some of you and I'm excited to do some more of these write-ups moving forward!",

That is why we decided to go directly to the website managers because they typically manage 10+ websites (sometimes 100+ or 1000+). From there we make them as successful as possible. Sometimes they need help demoing their clients, customizing client bots, or account setup. We will train their teams and then they take it from there.",

Trade shows are good but decision makers attend to trade shows for a limited time to make a few meetings. You won't be impressing your target clients, CEO, managers etc with shiny free stuff, because they do not have time to walk around maybe other than visiting few new tech demonstrations. The critical issue here is to find your spot in those decision maker meeting cycles and do some demonstrations which requires contacts to be setup months before. Trade shows are ideal to reach your potential clients in one place and have meetings one after another which normally would take months of reach out, scheduling etc.  Still how many trade shows are there in a year? Can not be more than few at most, local and global. So trade shows are good but it sounds like it is centra l to your sales efforts which would be a bad practice.\n\nI would be more interested to hear about your \n- What is your sales teams day-to-activities?\n- What does your typical sales cycles look like? How do you optimize and track your sales team performance? How do you manage training? How about third party sales contractors?\n- How about market discovery?

You are one of the few who has endorsed LinkedIn ads. I\u2019m really curious as to your process around them. We are doing a lot with content. I was wondering if you\u2019d like to exchange notes. ",

These experiments can be both platform specific (e. g. running experiments on creatives and copy of Facebook ads) or experiments of platforms themselves (so experiments to check whether your customer are on Facebook anyway). Did you find out where your target audience is based on experiments or user testing as well? \n\n",

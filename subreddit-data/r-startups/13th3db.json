    "postText": "Hi all,   \n\n\nI'm in a very unique situation where I'm a \"junior cofounder\"/first employee of a lead generation agency/business. I joined when there was essentially no revenue or functioning product. We didn't talk about compensation/salary/equity at the time because... we weren't sure if there was even a business. But now, we're at 30-35k MRR and there's for sure a business so it's time to talk numbers.   \n\n\nI was initially offered 15% of the company but doing the math, even if we hit 1m in annual revenue at 70% margin, that would leave me with 105k/year which is... ok money. I've made more from w2 jobs (250k/year) in a completely different industry.   \n\n\n15% sounds great if an exit occurs, but it's extremely unlikely that this will happen. I'm not even thinking about exit. I'm thinking of this just as a cash business.   \n\n\nMy questions are: \n\n1. Should I ask for a base salary on top of the 15% equity? \n2. Ideally, I want to make at least 200k/year, but that would require the company to do 2m in revenue. It's not that I'm not confident in the business, but to do 2m in revenue, that sounds very difficult. Hell even 1m sounds very difficult. I'm sure we can do it but how long would that take and how much work would that require from my end right? \n3. Any advice in general? \n\n  \nIf anybody is willing to talk this out with me over DM, I would really appreciate it. This is very uncharted territory for me.",

The people on this message board are going to do a relatively poor job assessing the revenue opportunity for this business, as well as whether there are exit opportunities.\n\nIt seems like the main question is, is this a \u201chigh touch\u201d business where you\u2019ll never really get leverage so you\u2019ll have to hire way more people to get to 5-10m in revenue? If so you are probably not going to achieve your goals with this arrangement. If it\u2019s possible for a small group of employees to get to that level, you could make \u201cbig bucks\u201d here.\n\nTo be clear, as a first employee in a venture backed startup, 15% would be an amazing grant. As a true co-founder obviously less so. And in a venture backed startup you\u2019d also take a (low, bare minimum) salary. But also the goal for a venture backed startup is to get to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue - and there would be no profits for years and no expectation that profits would be distributed to shareholders such as yourself.",

The salary might not meet your expectations unless you've raised money though. 35k mmr, 70% margin is just under 300k per year. It seems highly unlikely you would be able to reasonably take 200k of that without funding. It also really depends how many employees there are.\n\nYou're getting a sizeable amount of equity, that's generally in lieu of market salary. The whole, do you really believe and are you ready to make it become a 2m or 20m business is the question. Nobody here can answer that for you.",

            "comment": "Is the agency an LLC or a c-Corp? The way you\u2019re talking about it, sounds like an LLC. \n\nThis is important because membership and ownership in an LLC works differently than in a C-Corp. C-coros are based on owning shares of stock in the corporation. The classes are typically dictated by funding rounds, and all shares of stock in the same class have equal rights. \n\nAn LLC is based on percentage ownership, and there are two types of ownership\u2014profit interest and capital interest. \n\nIn profit interest, you get a portion of the future profits and growth of the business. In capital interest, you get a portion of the current assets and future. Based on how you\u2019re describing this, it sounds like you\u2019re being offered a profit interest membership in the LLC. \n\nUnderstood there was no revenue when you joined, but how long had the founding team been going before you got there? What work had they done? (Built product? Established partnerships? Relationships? Market reputation? Brand? Marketing?)\n\nAgencies are very different from a \u201ctech\u201d startup. You\u2019re not likely going to exit in the traditional way. Getting to \u201cMRR\u201d isn\u2019t the same in a tech business. Tech companies scale massively, which is why their  valuations come at multiples of revenue. Whereas agencies scale very slowly\u2014they\u2019re typically talent constrained, and valuations come as a multiple of EBITDA. \n\nI\u2019d need more information here to give you better information on what you should be pushing for.",

    "postText": "Sharing my misery;\n\nWe're trying to build a mobile game - we already knew that this area is full of spammers, scammers and the like. However we did NOT expect it to be this bad.\n\nOur official accounts run several post series across all popular SM. 3 out of 4 people who engage with us are bots trying to sell their promo services, so-called professional chatters and other people who try to scam 1-2$ or so. When we started our Discord server, we made the mistake of opening out the mod applications (volunteering community mods, not a paid position since it's all about keeping the chat clean and striking some conversation), only to get flooded by offers of \"working for free but we must pay their internet bill\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are the scams or low-effort ads we encountered so far:\n\n\\- people claiming they'll promote our project or bring members to our Discord - bots, everytime.\n\n\\- community mods, collab managers, \"professional chatters\" - by that, they mean saying \"gm\" and \"how are you today\" every couple of hours or so\n\n\\- presumed volunteers who don't have a stable internet connection and ask you to pay for theirs (it's not them that want to get paid, it's just that they need their wifi to be online!)\n\n\\- \"chinese investors\" that promise they will get hundreds or thousands of eager and wealthy patrons from China and get them to support your project.\n\n\\- experts in whatever field or theme you tackle that offer their extremely professional services for a moderate fee.\n\nWhat all of them have in common?\n\n\\- bad English\n\n\\- VERY insistent, to the point where they tag us every couple of hours or so.\n\n\\- weird mannerisms &amp; odd requests\n\n\\- overly polite. Not professional, just polite, where they stop every 2-3 messages and \"ask us very kindly\" if \"they should continue or let us think about this offer so that they don't burden our very busy schedule\"\n\n\\- making compliments or remarks about the project while it's obvious they know nothing about it. One of them called our project \"intriguing\" and \"with unique potentials\", but when prompted to explain what they found intriguing or interesting about it, they left the Discord server.\n\n\\- (lately) prompts or proposals written using ChatGPT. By now most people who read copy everyday online are pretty familiar with the blurb structure &amp; the buzzwords used by OpenAI. It's even easier to spot them when they write a 5 paragraph blurb on how amazed they are about our project and how lucky we'd be to hire them in perfect, adjective-heavy English and then struggling to express themselves in more than a couple of words.\n\nPfft, rant over. What's your experience with people like that? I guess areas other than gaming don't face as much scamming &amp; spamming?",

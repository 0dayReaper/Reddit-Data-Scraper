Executing them in a timely fashion is the problem, and you have that skill seemingly.\n\nMy own problem is i have a thousand ideas, not all 'good' maybe (although that is simply comes down to execution) but they are there filling my head and causing me to procrastinate on completing any one quickly.\n\nThe problem I think most people have is not coming up with ideas, but thinking they haver to come up this AN idea: One idea to rule them all. One SINGULAR idea that is the next great thing. Don't think like this.\n\nSit down, stop worrying about what the next great thing is going to be and how you need to find it and make it a billion $$ unicorn. Just list out your passions - the things you could talk to a stranger about for hours and bore the piss out of them but be SUPER excited someone is letting you speak to them about it. Then make a list of all the things that you wish you could do or be better at (health, a sport, typing, reading more, finding friends, finding ideas, whatever). \n\nNow go build things that scratch your itch in those things. Did you write down 10, 25, 50, 100 things? Build some little app for each one. Launch them quickly, and see if anyone else cares about them. If so, double down on it. If not move on to the next one. You'll fail alot, but eventually you'll find others that share your passion/problem and that's when you monetize them.\n\nI know I'm preaching from a point of failure so who am I to give advice, but after listening to and reading the stories of more than 200 successful makers, and having a background in Sales, this seems to be the secret sauce: It's a numbers game and you will NEVER know what the \"one idea to rule them all\" will be so built lots of bad ones until you stumble upon a good one.\n\nJust my worthless $0.02.",

    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nOur company is currently discussing with a few big players in the field for an investment and/or commercial partnership. We are a topic on these companies next board meeting and a decision should be coming in the next few months. \n\nBecause we run out of money quite soon, we are currently raising money in a bridge round to basically buy us time to finalize these deals. \n\nDoes anybody here have some advice about the do's and don'ts of sharing news, whether through our channels (LinkedIn, website) or external channels? Certain things to avoid, things we need to push? Or are we overestimating the importance of our communication strategy in these investment discussions. \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!",

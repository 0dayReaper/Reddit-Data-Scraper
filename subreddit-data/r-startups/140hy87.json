    "postText": "I (27m) in university and very business minded. A couple of years ago (2019) with my best friend attending the same uni plus some few others decided to build an ecommerce website which we barely did as the rest were just being lazy. Our site luckily enough got recognized by a technology agency of the federal government and we ended up being invited to many national events. We were ultimately hindered by the lack of funding as is the typical startup culture with my country.\n\n2022, I had this great idea for an EduTech startup and approached a few hardworking ones and we took off building it. Everything started great but months later we're still stuck on the technical aspects as I am not well versed with that section of things. And we have no money to outsource to paid freelancers. I am completely frustrated. How do they always show me they're ready and down to work then just blow me off once things get going?\n\nAm I the problem? How do I go about this?\n\nUpdate: it's not MY thing or project and I want them to work for free. It's a team each with assigned tasks. I just happen to be the lead.",

I'm uncertain of the ideal number of users for this process - whether it should be 10 or 100. \n\nHow have you approached this step in the past? I'm seeking advice from experienced founders. Any other recommendations would also be greatly appreciated.",

Congrats on nearly completing your app! \ud83d\ude04 What I've done in the past is to use friends, family, or co-workers for initial testing, and then depending on app complexity, shoot for 30-50 users/testers. The exact number isn't as important as gathering diverse feedback. Don't forget to iterate after receiving input! Good luck!\ud83d\udc4d",

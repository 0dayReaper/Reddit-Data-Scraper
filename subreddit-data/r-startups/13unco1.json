After watching an episode from the last seasons of **Silicon Valley** where one person was buying up various company names and then suing other companies afterwards.  \n\r  \nThere is always the fear that if, for example, my app goes up, but I don't register the company, some troll will register it in his name and that's it, trouble will ensue.\r  \n\r  \nWhat do you think about this in general?",

Motivation is if *anything* bad happens with data-retention, the business is liable, not you personally.\n\nIt's ok to register and not raise money immediately. Just make sure you are up front with investors saying, \"I did this to mitigate a risk and didn't need to raise funds yet.\" You can always change the name later should the need arise.",

You may also want to incorporate for legal reasons (eg. patent filing).\n\nOne last thing to consider: a lot of benefits are only open to \"young\" companies: tax breaks (Singapore tax exemption for startups), software perks (Hubspot, Intercom), grants &amp; subsidies (most BPI programs in France). So maybe don't incorporate too early.",

If you ever want to take investment though, most likely they would want you to register as a C-corp in Delaware or something, but it involves a lot of paperwork and money and most startups fail before this step. So go head and register the LLC. If anything you can use the same as the holding company for the next idea if your current one fail.",

The time you spend working on it now is time you can be vesting your equity.  This is advice given by a number of different lawyers in startup land. \n\nInvestors want to see founders on a vesting schedule regardless if you own the company today 100% or split with others.",

            "comment": "It's easy to form your own entity. It cost me like $90 in Colorado. Don't pay one of those services that charges hundreds or thousands. \n\nAll you need to form an LLC is a name, a registered office/agent in the state (which can be your address or you can pay for one but honestly they're a rip off), and an organizer (which can be you for simplicity... This is the person who signs the charter). Then you can make an operating agreement but you don't have to do that right away...the states LLC laws will govern the LLC if you don't have an operating agreement. You may also want a set of organizing resolutions which names officers and authorizes the company to open a bank account and lays out the equity split and things like that but you don't have to do that right away.\n\nThat's the way it *generally* works but every state is different. Once you have money flowing in and especially if you have multiple people involved, you will want a lawyer to help you with the operating agreement. That's where all the important stuff is.\n\nAlso when you do form the entity, start using it to do things like sign the lease, have assets in its name, etc. You want everything in the name of the LLC not you.\n\nOh and one last piece of advice... Be sure to keep the funds for the company separate from your personal finances, especially never pay personal expenses from your business account. Form a business account where all the business revenue flows and where all the business expenses are paid. If you don't do this, you are at risk of piercing the corporate shield which means you can become liable for the business' liabilities which defeats the entire purpose of having a corporate entity.",

While there isn't a specific timeframe that applies to all startups, it's generally recommended to register your company as early as possible. By doing so, you gain legal protection, establish credibility, and create a separate legal entity for your business.\r  \n\r  \nRegistering your company helps prevent others from using your business name or intellectual property without permission. It also provides you with limited liability protection, separating your personal assets from your business liabilities.\r  \n\r  \nWhile the scenario you mentioned from Silicon Valley can be a concern, registering your company early can help mitigate such risks. It's advisable to conduct a thorough search to ensure the availability of your desired company name before registration. Additionally, you can consider consulting with an attorney to understand the legal implications and take appropriate steps to safeguard your intellectual property rights.\r  \n\r  \nUltimately, registering your company sooner rather than later can provide legal protection, establish credibility, and mitigate potential risks associated with intellectual property infringement.",

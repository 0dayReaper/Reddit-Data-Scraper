I would love to hear the experiences of people who have worked/started a business there.\n\nMy gut feeling tells me Paris would give better opportunities, but at the same time it seems like Lisbon's startup scene is growing lately. What do you think?",

Paris has it's issues, but I would say the future is brighter - there's a lot going on in France these days and the economy is much more diversified",

Language is a blocker if you don't speak French.\n\nLisbon is a rising star, though bureaucratic as well, the government is decisive to grow the city into a startup factory with a lot of incentives in place. Because of this, it attracts more funding from other European cities or even other continents. As a foreigner who has been living in Lisbon over the last 10 years and active in the startup community here, I see the dramatic growth and the potential. Plus, you don't need Portuguese to live in Lisbon. After 10 years, I still don't speak fluent Portuguese (shame...)",

    "postText": "Everybody and their dog seems to want to build a startup, but guess how many of those actually get to delivering a finished product and turning a profit? Not many!\n\nThe problem is the way most approach entrepreneurship is flawed from the beginning. They try to be disruptors, build the new *put-successful-company-name-here* and end up with a unicorn. Unfortunately, though, not many of those actually have the chutzpah and genius needed to do that.  \nEver wondered why we always hear about the [Jobses](http://www.apple.com), [Zuckerbergs](http://www.facebook.com), [Kalanicks](https://www.uber.com/) and [Cheskys](https://www.airbnb.com/), and only about them? That\u2019s because there are not many people who can actually build something so successful and disruptive.\n\nI\u2019m not being negative here: it\u2019s ok not to be a genius. It\u2019s enough to be smart and willing to **work hard**, which is all it takes to be successful in entrepreneurship. Ok, throw in a bit of luck, too, but keep in mind *luck favors the persistent.*\n\nToo many people focus on money when beginning in entrepreneurship. They dream of [billion dollar valuations](https://medium.com/@jasonfried/how-much-is-basecamp-worth-i-don-t-know-and-i-don-t-care-76016b404020), fame and IPOs. However, that\u2019s not the best way to start a business.\n\n&gt; Anyone can create a job for themselves. But not everyone can change the world.  \n&gt; [**Dan Norris**](http://dannorris.me/), [*The 7 Day Startup: you don\u2019t learn until you launch*](http://amzn.com/1502472392)\n\n## Building a healthy business\n\nWhat you should focus on instead, is to build a small business, focused on growth and most important on delivering value to your customers. The focus from day one should be on getting clients to pay for your product.  \nIf you need a lot of money first, then it\u2019s not a good idea for a business. A solid and healthy venture, should get the money it needs from its customers, not from VCs.\n\nI know many who say: \u201cI need X amount of money to start\u201d, \u201cWithout a VC we can\u2019t make it\u201d and many more excuses.  \nThe reality is you can easily start a business while working a 9-5 job, which will dramatically reduce the amount of money you need. Then when you have 6 to 12 months of cash in the bank, you\u2019re ready to quit your job and focus solely on your business.\n\n## Would you rather be a Basecamp or a dead unicorn?\n\n&gt; Small is not just a stepping-stone. Small is a great destination itself  \n&gt; **Jason Fried**, [*Basecamp*](http://basecamp.com/)\n\nOne business I deeply admire is [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/).\n\nThey did everything right:\n\n* Launched a product while being a full-time consultancy shop\n* Once they had enough traction they focused on Basecamp full-time\n* They didn\u2019t sell-off to VCs\n* And most important: **they made money in the process**\n\nThis is what most failing *startups* did in comparison:\n\n* Raised money from angels\n* Built a limited version of their product\n* Raised some more money from VCs\n* Built more features\n* Raised some more money from VCs\n* Pivoted\n* Burnt through their cash reserves\n* **FAILED!**\n\nNow, I admit Basecamp is a pretty solid product which for most people would be considered a huge success. However, you could be just as successful even if you didn\u2019t make it as big as Basecamp.  \nBut what would you prefer: making some money and be a success or burning through others\u2019 money and fail?\n\n## How to start your own business\n\n&gt; Everyone is an entrepreneur. The only skills you need to be an entrepreneur are the ability to fail, to have ideas, to sell those ideas, to execute on them, and to be persistent so even as you fail you learn and move onto the next adventure.  \n&gt; **James Altucher**, [*Choose Yourself!*](http://amzn.com/1490313370)\n\nThe first step is to leave your assumptions aside: we all have ideas we would like to turn into products, however, they are just our own and so we tend to be a bit biased.  \nInstead, you should look for others\u2019 pains and needs and build a product out of those.\n\nGo on [Quora](http://www.quora.com/), [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/) or any other online location where your peers like to hang out and discuss.  \nLook for common questions being asked: people trying to fix a problem they have, looking for a better way to do something, complaining about an existing tool\u2019s shortcomings. You get the idea.\n\nNow, think about how you could help those people by building a product or providing a service \u2014 if you decide to provide a service, try to present it in a way to make it look like a product, [WPCurve](http://wpcurve.com/)-style.\n\nAt this point you should know what you want to build. It\u2019s time to build the easiest, yet still useful, version of your product.  \nAll the *nice-to-haves* should be left out for when you have the time and money for them. Focus on where the meat is, what gets you the most results in the least possible time.  \nIf you\u2019re building a productized service, you might even want to do everything yourself manually, while presenting it in a way that makes it look automatic: it\u2019s not cheating, since your customers would be getting the same result anyway. *But always deliver \u2014 or over-deliver \u2014 on what you promise!*\n\n**Launch and start selling!**\n\nOnce you build the first version, your focus should be on promoting your product and the best way to do it is to start a blog and talk to your audience, helping them by writing great content that speaks directly to them and gets them to realize how much value you can provide them.  \nBe honest and helpful, always, and try to give away more than you get back.\n\nAfter a while, you\u2019ll know if your product can make it or not, but you won\u2019t know it until you actually sit down, build it and launch it.\n\n## It\u2019s good to be profitable\n\nRemember, the focus of a business should be on delivering value and making money while doing so, unlike a *usual* startup, whose sole purpose often seems to be burning money and thinking of ways to eventually turn a profit in the future.\n\nUnless you have plenty of your own money to invest (think Elon Musk) or you are 16, let the others be the disruptors and be an entrepreneur instead!\n\n*****\n\n[**You can see the post with all the images on my blog**](http://finotto.org/entrepeneurship/dont-build-a-startup-build-a-business-instead/)",

Evolution.     \n\nHowever the 'startup' world loves its buzzwords and having a buzzword based language so to speak just adds a level of professionalism to help outsiders see its legitimacy and also add some type of barrier to entry. Most professions have their own sort of language. (Think lawyers and finance) terms that create sort of an inner circle. Call it what you want - most successful ones usually can be sold (exit strategy) or continued as a profitable/sustainable endeavor and were crated with that in mind. ",

This simply goes to show that their isn't much to invest in anymore for monumental gains besides angle/vc type investments and funds as well as fund of funds just hope that one day the company will ipo or sell, taking the debt and liability burden off of the original VC. Besides the minutia and technicalities, I don't see how this is any different than a Ponzi scheme. I guess the only difference here is that your investors are aware of the risks, whereas the former is sketchy and not as transparent.",

I think there is a difference though between that and a B2C business with a product that is easy to copy and is only valuable when many people are using it. Examples include SnapChat and Instagram. \n\nI wish it would make sense to bootstrap all businesses, but for those types of businesses you need to show customers are willing to use it and then scale quickly before the competition rips off your product. The value comes from the number of users. \n\nA good dev team can rip off most apps like Instagram and SnapChat in less than 6 months, so whoever is first wins. Once you have good market penetration, then you can start monetizing it. I do think it's good to have a clear plan of how money can be made before launching the product, but getting users for such a product should be top priority. \n\n",

I was wage slaving while others were building.

Sure, the abstract concept of a business involves an equally abstract *aim* of realizing profits - but that doesn't mean that something has to be profitable all day 'err day in order to be a business. \n\nSo perhaps what you really want to say is that businesses that aren't profitable are *crappy* businesses. That's sort of like me saying that toddlers and folks on contraception are crappy humans because they're not currently fertile. \n\n&gt;How will you get the money?\n\nSpeaking abstractly, my preferred methods of financing for some hypothetical new business would depend *on the business*. My method to date has been to raise multiple flavors of equity and debt from external investors.\n\n&gt;While both can be done, unless your venture requires enormous overhead (which would make saving/investors even more difficult) \n\nI don't know what you mean by 'enormous overhead', but suppose hypothetical me needs (or wants) external funds to launch my hypothetical business. So what? Why are your perceptions of the difficulty of self-funding or finding investors germane? \n\n&gt;the best way to fund your business is working your business.\n\nYes, just like the best way for Tim Cook to source aluminum for iPhones, of course, is for him to personally dig bauxite out from under Apple's HQ and smelt it. \n\nYou're stipulating that the only legitimate/best/sole method of funding a business is through retained earnings. This is the financial equivalent of telling strangers that they're going to hell for using condoms. It's insane gibberish. \n\nWhy the fuck shouldn't I invest my own capital or issue equity (or issue/take on debt, or lease assets, or pay for services with equity or royalties on revenue, etc.)? Why do you think we have a financial sector? \n\n&gt;If you can't make money at it, why should anyone (including yourself) invest heavily in it?\n\nI'll be charitable and ignore the voodoo assumptions that a) I can't make money solo at this hypothetical business, and b) whether or not I can is somehow related to the best way of funding it.\n\nSuppose I go for a massage. I discover that the masseur can't work out the kinks in his own back, and he *expects me to provide the body for him to work on*. Quite clearly, I would leave immediately. The whole idea is just lunacy, isn't it? \n\n\n\n\n \n\n",

What I said is axiomatic in the case of most startups - it takes money to make money, and my advice does not depend on external variables like good credit, investors, or coming from money.

It's awesome if you can knock out some code or craft the first batch at home, launch, build customers, start earning revenue and bootstrap from there.

And, I mean this is just me, but my net worth is a negative number, and I don't have an account at the bank of mom and dad. I'd love it if I didn't need a VC's money to start, but I do. I don't need a lot of money, but I need *some*. And like I said, investors don't want to buy companies, they want to sell them. When I first read \"building to flip is building to flop\" on [SvN](https://signalvnoise.com/), I was inspired. But after learning about what it actually takes to get a company off the ground today, I'm jaded.

Plus the collapse of an obsolete car industry did the rest. About SpaceX.. strategic orbital space transport.. no way they started up only with a dream, were backed up Before start all. They are the only competitors to Russians, and some banking orgs can be pushed by superior National strategic interests. Not the way for 37signals.  BTW I'm a huge fan of all the three. \n EDIT: Bootstrap, not bootstrapped-",

I strongly believe that nowadays majority of people in silicon valley misunderstood the true meaning of startup.\n\nThe essence of all startups should be a business to make money and the only reason you raise money is when you really need these money to expand your business. And many times you don't actually need any money or to be full-time in order to bootstrap your business. But most people thought that raising money is the pre-requisite for a startup.\n\nEverything comes for a reason, we should all keep asking ourselves why we need extra money NOW, why we need to quit our full time job NOW etc.. Try to evaluate the cost, risk and potential benefit and make your decision in a rational way instead of following what others are doing, which is even more true when 99+% of startups failed eventually.",

While I would argue that there's enough problems out there to keep an entrepreneur busy for the rest of their life and then some, you have to pick something that you can genuinely enjoy fixing.\n\nIt's hard work, and you have to assume that initially you'll be doing all the work and with no one to hold you accountable for not doing it besides yourself, so there's going to be a lot of temptation to lose focus and drift.\n\nSo you really need to pick something that stands out from the rest to avoid that temptation, something to balance out the pain and loneliness you'll likely be facing along your journey.\n\nDoesn't have to be super sexy either, definitely don't pick an idea for another mobile-focused social networking idea, but do try and find a solution that you can make kinda fun, with people that you can genuinely enjoy being around.\n\nI mean, Github is built around hosted version control.  Sounds boring at a glance, but they made it fun, and they get to work with developers all day.  Digital Ocean provides cheap VPS servers, but they made it fun and easy to spin up a new server, and you can tell that the people who work there have fun.  Dropbox provides people with simple cloud storage, but the design is very fun and fresh.\n\nSo yeah, I guess the advice I'm giving is don't try to do something that's super sexy but requires VC money, but don't try to go after a problem because the solution is so boring that no one really wants to tackle it.  Go after a problem that might seem kinda boring, but you can visualize a fun and friendly solution for.",

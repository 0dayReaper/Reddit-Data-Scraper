I feel like bootstrapping and many startups rely on this type of behavior, versus setting up a failsafe system right away to catch the squeaky drawers (so that you aren't trying to fix the drawer when what you really need is a light to see.) \n\nIt doesn't necessarily take money to do it, but I would argue you definitely lose money, i.e. holding off scaling until you are sure you can handle it. But being ready first, systems in place seems much better than running around like a chicken with its head cut off. Of course, things happen...",

Make a note that you need to fix the drawer.  Don't get distracted.\n\nThe general trend of programmers is towards premature optimization.  It  isn't always obvious how much you need to do, but I have wasted time on premature optimization way more often than I have regretted not doing it.  Mainly because you don't know what you need to optimize until you really get into it.  A lot of times you optimize the wrong thing in anticipation of need that never occurs.",

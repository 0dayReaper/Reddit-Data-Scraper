    "postText": "I just started a position a little over 2 months ago at a Startup in Customer Success, I was originally pulled towards the position since it was in a space that I was already experienced in. Coming from another startup I thought I knew what I was getting into but now I find myself working 60-70 hours a week already feeling tired and burnt out from the position. The pressure/stress is immense and management's expectations have been way beyond what I was presented with on my contract. To be honest I'm just ready to quit on the spot however the salary is better than my last positon and I've gotta pay the rent somehow. Everyday feels like I'm about to get fired or just get yelled up on the spot for my performance, really feeling disencouraged since I dont have any time to search for anything else. Its been hard to explain that I need a work-life balance (Which was promised that would not happen) to take care of my dog, family members, and just myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm looking for advice for transitioning out of this company however I cant seem to find another company that is looking for a similar experience. Any advice would be appreciated",

No one can force you to work more than your contractually agreed hours on a consistent basis - and certainly not without pay!\n\nI would suggest to:\n\n - Start logging your hours so you have documentation.\n\n - Have a calm discussion with your management about it.\n\n - If you cannot get them to decrease your workload, you'll eventually have to set the boundaries as suggested above yourself. It's tough, but it is within your power.\n\nIf they fire you, it will be unjust (I know in some countries you don't have much protection during your trial period) and you have a decent case against them.\n\nMost importantly, don't allow yourself to get burned out. I've seen several colleagues go though that and it ain't pretty. Not worth any salary. It could leave you unable to work full-time for years, not to mention the impact on your health and your family.\n\nThe founders sound toxic, so perhaps consider accelerating your exit.",

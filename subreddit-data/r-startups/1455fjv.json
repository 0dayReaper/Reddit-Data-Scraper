    "postText": "Some might say the flexibility of pricing it in multiple currencies might help the customer or get more customers. But then they might use the currencies as a means to get your product slightly cheaper, is this one thing you just accept as is? Or do you just firmly plant your price on this one currency and while some people might leave or stop using your product all together, you'd lose them anyways so who cares. Is it better to just price it in one currency and focus on creating a better product than worrying about currencies?",

There's an active court case in the UK deliberating over whether merely having stripe auto-converted currencies into the euro is enough to mean you target the UK + EU.\n\nCurrency is one of the triggers that potentially mean you target the EU.  Others include advertising, European languages, etc.  But if you don't advertise into the EU, and only have your site in English, I would not put prices in euros and thus, assuming you aren't in the EU, you are highly likely not subject to GDPR.

We've seen everything from a few cents savings in some cases to more than $1000 savings others (this was truly remarkable, so much so that the buyer did not actually believe we are a legitimate business, retail rate was around $2200, buyer paid $700).\n\nNot trying to dodge your question but truly there is a lot of variability.",

The idea of supplying astronauts with 2t containers of equipment, food and construction materials weekly isnt new, but H. Industries founder has come up with a new, novel propulsion method that enables the idea. Using scaled down particle accelerator magnets (HMF Nb3Sn Pulse Magnets) in a tight knit swarm of satellites arranged in layers, the group can act as an electromagnetic spring and orbital launch pad to move containers slowly and cheaply like the railroads of yesteryear. The founder is asking for investors to help fund the feasibility study as Phase 1 in a 4 stage plan! It will employ a team of seven engineers, physicists and project staff to validate both the design and business case, producing a manufacturable, mass producible schematic for trial in Phase 2.  \n**Life Cycle Stage** / Discovery - MVP Feasibility Study - Phase 1.

Both report very poor results for the amount of time spent on them\n\nAt Elate we're building more than just a dating app, we\u2019re building a digital matchmaker.

This included her reproductive endocrinologist, a different endocrinologist to treat thyroid issues, gastroenterologists to treat her Crohn's Disease, her primary care physician, and her regular OB-GYN. She often could not recall specific medication dosage, protocols, or other pertinent medical history information during appointments and the information was not always available or easily discoverable in her medical record.Rather than carry around your own binder, Focus Fertility believes patients should own their health data and have access to it when and how they want and use It to help with care coordination and improved health management.\n\nI have created a FIGMA mock up to conceptualize my concept: [https://www.figma.com/proto/hVYekSrqt3t8mRdRNl63k3/Focus-Fertility-Platform-Prototype-1.0?node-id=4%3A2&amp;scaling=scale-down&amp;page-id=0%3A1&amp;starting-point-node-id=4%3A2](https://www.figma.com/proto/hVYekSrqt3t8mRdRNl63k3/Focus-Fertility-Platform-Prototype-1.0?node-id=4%3A2&amp;scaling=scale-down&amp;page-id=0%3A1&amp;starting-point-node-id=4%3A2)\n\nAbout the market:\n\nFertility treatment and assisted reproductive therapies (ART) use is rapidly expanding in the United States. There were 330,773 (ART) cycles in the US in 2019 with 2X growth in ART cycles over last 10 years and 8% growth alone from 2018 to 2019. Odds are you have or you know someone who has experienced fertility issues. This is a rapidly growing market with potential for innovation.\n\n**What life cycle stage is your start up at?**\n\nDiscovery\n\n**What is Your role?**\n\nFounder\n\n**What goals are you trying to reach this month?**\n\nContinue to interview potential customers to specifically identify issues patients experience and learn how they access and use their health information.\n\n**How could** r/startups **help?**\n\nI am a non-technical co-founder who has over 13 years of experience of health policy and regulatory analysis, actively involved in the infertility patient community helping to lead advocacy efforts, and most importantly a patient. I am looking for help on the technical side through a potential technical co-founder or a developer who aligns with the values and mission of this idea and wants to expand access to fertility treatment and decentralize health information ownership.\n\nI am currently signed up for a virtual Launch Camp through Seed Spot in January to help fine tune and challenge many of the aspects of the concept but want to learn as much as I can from previous start up founders to best prepare for a future launch.\n\n**Discount for** r/startup **subscribers?**\n\nSince the idea is still in discovery there is not a product available to download and no discounts",

It spans a wide range of activities, including 1) how much to put into an emergency savings fund, 2) why investing your cash is so important, 3) how to allocate your cash between 401(k)s, HSAs, 529s and IRAs, 4) what to invest in within each of those accounts, 5) a plan for achieving goals such as a down payment or retirement and 6) strategies for minimizing your taxes.\n\nMany younger folks are unfamiliar with financial planning as they typically do not have a lot of assets and are simply focused on starting their careers and balancing their budgets. Traditionally, financial advisors, but because they are rather expensive services, it typically does not make economic sense for most folks until well into their 40s and 50s when they have sufficiently complex situations. However, because of the power of compounding returns, the earlier a person engages with financial planning, the more effective their money is.\n\nOne of the challenges with financial planning is that it\u2019s hard for people to focus on long term goals that can span decades. Progress towards those goals simply aren\u2019t tangible and it\u2019s easy to get knocked off course. We believe that by engaging with your money and focusing on small discrete steps, it\u2019s much easier to build up the strong habits that are needed for financial success over the long run. A focus on financial wellness and on reducing one\u2019s anxiety with money can be a much more successful method of making money a partner in one\u2019s life, as opposed to a source of unhealthy dependency.\n\n**What life cycle stage is your startup at?** Validating our solution with a MVP\n\n**What goals are you trying to reach this month?:** User feedback / validation\n\n**How could** r/startups **help?:** Check out the website and let us know",

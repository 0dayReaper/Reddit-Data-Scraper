    "postText": "Greetings,\r  \n\r  \nI am currently developing an app which I plan to release on the App Store in the next few weeks. As the app has considerable potential, there's a chance it might evolve into a startup venture in the future.\r  \n\r  \nCurrently, I'm planning to publish the app through an Individual Developer account on Apple. However, I am wondering if transitioning to a business account later on might pose any challenges or complications.\r  \n\r  \nIf anyone has navigated this process before, I would be immensely grateful to hear your experiences and any advice you might be able to share.\r  \n\r  \nThanks for your time.\r  \n\r  \nBest regards.",

If you start from individual, you can transition to an LLC, but you cannot transition to a c corp. you\u2019ll have to do an app transfer. If your end goal is llc, then individual to llc is easy.",

Apple considers it to be a different business, and you must re-sign a contract / potentially re-do through the business account process. Even if you change your corp name, you have to resign paperwork. \n\nWhichever account holds the app is legally responsible for it, so Apple is very thorough in making sure they have the proper business documentation in the event of an issue. \n\nI didn't find changing from an individual account to a business account to be much hassle, but I also did it a couple years ago. Just make sure you do it before you a launch deadline because it may take some time.",

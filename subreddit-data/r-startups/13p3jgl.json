    "postText": "People often say \u201cscratch your own itch\u201d or \u201cfind someone with a problem\u201d. I find this advice rather frustrating for a number of reasons I won\u2019t go into right now. The following are an incomplete list of business models which I\u2019ve listed to help you brainstorm ideas for your next startup! Let me know what you think I\u2019m missing or additional thoughts\n\n1. Find a parade \u2014 Find people who are already part of a growing movement and get in front of them. Infiltrate, bring them together, speak their language and \u201cbe the DJ\u201d\n2. Makeover \u2014 10x something that exists. Make it niche-specific, more accessible, better designed, or faster time-to-fun\n3. Expedite \u2014 Find something people do repetitively, and help them do it faster\n4. Made Easier \u2014 Find something difficult or repetitive that people do and make it easier for them\n5. X but for Y \u2014 Tweak an existing application, framework, or model\u2026 Apply it to a different audience or a subset of who it is currently offered to\n6. Agency \u2014 White glove bespoke / tailored services for high-value customers\n7. Convenience \u2014 Value offered comes primarily in convenience, bargain, and/or regularity\n8. Variety \u2014 Take something people already like to buy and offer more options\n9. Customization \u2014 Deliver a one-size fits all service with customizable upgrades\n10. Kingmaker \u2014 Provide ownership (however temporary), high-value network, club, recognition, pedigree, or exclusive access\n11. Database \u2014 Sell access to an up-to-date collection of data\n12. Platform \u2014 Give people the ability to build or reach an audience\n13. Double-Sided Marketplace \u2014 Roll-up or unbundle transactions of goods &amp; services\n14. By-product \u2014 Look to waste, underleveraged utility, or excess output. Look for what can be upcycled or re-purposed\n15. Brand \u2014 Package an experience or normal thing, but make it special with craftsmanship, celebrity endorsement, special ingredients, and/or cool-factor\n16. Discount \u2014 Give people a deal in virtue of your leveraged connection to a supplier or  manufacturer. Provide a cheaper alternative, or help them buy together in bulk\n17. Arbitrage \u2014 Find something you can re-sell for more than you acquired it for\n18. Add-on \u2014 Integrate with a product or service to add value\n19. Turn-key \u2014  Sell an opportunity that has a proven clear path to success\n20. Educate \u2014 Sell opportunity and hope through courses or curriculum. Synthesize and bundle information\n21. Freemium \u2014 Give away a product/service in order to attract a % of enterprise customers\n22. Productized Service \u2014 Streamline the delivery of a service by automating aspects which allow you to charge less\n23. Automation \u2014 Take a manual process which is human-intensive and make machines do it\n24. Licensing \u2014 Leverage or develop intellectual property. Create a governing body.\n25. Picks &amp; Shovels \u2014 Own the pipes. Procure the means of distribution, manufacturing, or discovery\n26. Trend Chasing \u2014 Look for shifts in policy, regulations, or culture which unlock new opportunities\n27. Pair down \u2014 Feature-bloated apps often have a single feature that gets used most by a specific subset of users. Build only that feature and communicate the value clearly\n28. Gamify \u2014 Find something mundain that can be made fun using game mechanics &amp; reward systems\n29. Vanity \u2014 People like to talk about themselves or showcase their ideas, values, and experiences (especially to like-minded people)\n30. Match-Making \u2014 Dating, hook-ups, and friend-finding\n31. Endless scroll \u2014 Create consistently good content (or leverage someone else\u2019s content)\n32. Rage \u2014 People like to vent and righteous anger is addictive. It solidifies \u201cin-group mentality\u201d by letting them feel affirmed in their position\n33. Scarcity \u2014 Create unique and limited runs of something that can become collectable\n\nedit: Part 2 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/13pf4wv/how\\_to\\_generate\\_business\\_ideas\\_p2/",

    "postText": "I've been contemplating the role of social media platforms in the job search process, particularly in the tech industry. While platforms like LinkedIn have gained immense popularity and are often cited as essential for professionals, I'm curious to know how skilled developers perceive and utilize LinkedIn for finding job opportunities. Do you personally rely on LinkedIn to find job opportunities in the tech industry? If so, why? If not, what alternative methods have you found effective?\n\nI personally believe skilled developers may not frequently use platforms like LinkedIn to hunt for jobs. In fact, I believe skilled developers, as well as professionals in other skilled occupations, are often recruited through attractive offers that can entice them to leave their current jobs. However, I acknowledge that I may be completely wrong here.Please let me know what you think.",

They can use LinkedIn and be attracted by good offers. \n\nI'm a software engineer that has worked at top tech companies, and every offer I got was from recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn. It's nice because if you have a decent profile, you'll get at least a few messages a week from recruiters.",

The hardest part is figuring out where you want to work and the type of project you want to work on. If you have a particular topic or company, and you are an experienced developer with a good track history, You just contact the company, generally through a friend who works there or knows someone there, get an interview and see if there's a fit. I've never been rejected.",

            "comment": "9 years of experience here, but only worked for 2 companies (I didn't job hop). I still use LinkedIn as my main resource to find jobs. A few months ago I applied for 4 positions.      \n  \n1. Was rejected for one on the initial call because they were looking for .NET which I didn't have. Clearly they didn't read my CV.  \n2. I rejected the second on the initial call. It sounded decent and was a strong match for my skills, but not that interesting. The commute would have been a nightmare, even though it was only once a month.  \n3. Got rejected after the 4th technical interview for another company. I saw it coming though. They had a real hard on for TDD, which I would do if that's the way they role, but don't have much experience with it. Honestly think I dodged a bullet here. The pay was high, but the cult like vibes were strong :)  \n4. Got an offer after a crazy number of technical interviews at the 4th company. Again it was a good fit for my skills, and a 20k pay increase, but after some soul searching, I ended up turning it down after proposing switching to contracting part time for my current employer. A controversial choice but I value free time over more money.      \n  \nTLDR I don' t think it's too hard for senior devs to find jobs on linked in, and it's definitely useful, however I'd also say it's not essential. Current climate aside, I have connections, friends and former co-workers who have offered in the past to help set me up with a new role.      \n  \nI also know a lot of people who've moved into better, higher paying jobs because of former co-workers telling them the grass really can be greener.",

If they don't tell me compensation within 2 messages, I block them. I give higher priority to recruiters who actually work for the company and not an agency.\n\nI don't waste my time applying anymore to actually job boards.\n\nFunny story. I was a 100% perfect fit for this job, so I applied. Never heard a thing from the company. A year later, a different division in the same company reached out and I interviewed. I passed the interview, but they had some budget issues and couldn't make an offer. Three weeks later, the division I originally applied to gave me a call saying \"We saw your resume when it was put into our system by the other division...You're perfect for our division!\" Ended up working for them for 4 years.\n\nI don't know what happens when you apply online, but most of the systems are broken.",

If they actually bother interviewing then they'd have a job offer or two at any given time.\n\nI currently have 3 job offers I don't plan on taking. Two startups and a boring 9-5 megacorporation.",

I don\u2019t plan to complete to many tasks a day as I allocate some time for unplanned, urgent issues, the second reason, if I did too many things, the next day I am going to feel tires and it won\u2019t be productive.",

Each week has a specific goal (e.g. increase retention to 20%, increase new subscriptions, etc.). We then \"idea dump\" all tasks that could contribute to that goal. We then assign easy, medium, or hard to each task. And then we pick 3 hards, and ~6 mediums, and as many easy's as possible. And then we split between the two of us.\n\nAll left over ideas go back into our idea bucket file to get re-debated for another week's spec. Any incoming ideas throughout the week also go directly in the bin, to be discussed later so that focus isn't lost.",

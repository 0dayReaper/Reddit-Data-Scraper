    "postText": "Good friends of Reddit, I need your help!\n\nI read an article recently that stated b2b buyers increasingly want to self-educate without a sales rep present. In my experience (as a Rep) I find this to be partly true.\n\nAfter reading the article, I was even more curious about how other firms (both b2b and b2c) are handling content creation to educate customers.\n\nSo, my questions for founders, marketers, or anyone who its relevant to :\n\n1. What types of content do you see currently performing the best with your audience?\n2. What types of content do you see currently performing the worst with your audience?\n3. What type of content do you wish you had a chance to create more of?\n\nI hope to start a meaningful discussion, so feel free to chime in even if you're not a founder/marketer. Also, please denote whether you are referring to b2b/b2c in your response. Thanks in advance and looking forward to the discussion!",

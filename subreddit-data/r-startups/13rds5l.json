    "postText": "Hello, I am writing my Master's thesis on how green startups approach the duality of profit generation and environmental sustainability.\n\nI have prepared a short questionnaire for the founders who would be willing to help to give their 2 cents on how they see the startup ecosystem. Even if you did not found a green startup, it would be interesting to have your opinion on these questions so that I can make a benchmark.\n\n[Startup Questionnaire](https://forms.gle/LQaUAPGxFGETnM2a6)\n\nThank you so much for your help!",

To cite a few: the up cycling fashion industry is emerging, or aiding in the ESG assessment of companies. Governmental regulations today are creating these new markets where green startups suddenly become viable.",

            "comment": "Many impact driven startups don't see a duality between profits and impact, rather looking at them as going hand in hand. Providing positive outcomes for the users of your services and their communities is linked to profit, profit-making-ability is linked to the scalability of providing these outcomes.\n\nFor true card-carrying impact entrepreneurs, profitability is thought of as the price you need to pay to scale your impact. In practice, obviously there are a tonne of issues with this, plus a bunch of frameworks and legal structures like B-Corps that attempt to assist.\n\nOne of the things that recently helps to align incentives is investors themselves. Impact capital requires certain standard to ensure alignment between profit &amp; impact. VCs who seek these funds are required to comply and pass this down to startups. This is relatively effective, though the same measurement issues that occur in the non-profit world still occur.\n\nGood luck with the thesis",

But with a bit of googling you can find out more about B-Corps, impact investing &amp; impact metrics (look for talks/discussions that are targeted at VCs or hosted by ecosystem enablers (eg Gov Ministries, UNDP, Soveriegn Wealth Funds), not entrepreneurs as it will be spammy. \n\nOn the research side im sure there has been a lot of prior work as this isnt the first thesis Q&amp;A ive filled out :P Probably more helpful to you and not as anecdotal. Guys like the world bank also do regular well researched reports, as do the UN. I can point you to some domain/country specific examples (DM me) if you'd like.",

I am also starting a company that tries to redefine green fintech.\n\nIn my own humble opinion, I think that Greentech usually contradicts, at some point, fintech.\n\nI remember there was this consumerism thesis I read that consumer satisfaction is based on effort + natural resources, &gt;&gt; I forgot \n\nanyhow, there is a space I am tackling for my startup, after talking to some startups previously in the same space, they mentioned to me that \"people don't really care about the environmental aspect\" of the company, instead they only focus on profit.",

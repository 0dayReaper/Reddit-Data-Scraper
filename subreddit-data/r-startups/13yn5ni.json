That said, if you have a good product, you can still find a bank and find funding.  Compliance will be critical, though.  You can't get a bank partnership without being able to show that you have all of the required compliance policies, procedures, licenses, etc.",

I was employee # 20 for my first fintech GC role and about # 25 for my second GC gig. \n\nPractically, the low-cost options include: (1) not engaging in money transmission by partnering with an already licensed money transmitter for that part of your proposed business, (2) find a reasonably priced non-attorney compliance consultant who can probably provide a set of compliance policies at a more reasonable price than a lawyer.  Some lawyers will give you a certain amount of free time as a potential client, but I don't think any will give you a free 50-state plus federal money transmitter law survey for you for free.   \n\nOf course, off-the-shelf compliance policies won't be very well-adapted to your specific business.  You could, of course, hire a pricey law firm who has, hopefully, done this a thousand times already, but they still won't be cheap because they'll want to confirm that no laws have changed since they last did the research (particularly for money-transmitting laws where states frequently change their laws). Even a solo lawyer like me will be very expensive for a 50-state money transmitting project like this.  \n\nSome good resources here: [https://www.csbs.org/policy/tags/money-services-businesses](https://www.csbs.org/policy/tags/money-services-businesses) \n\nGood luck!",

I feel like it wouldn't make sense for me to pay for legal help when the product is changing so much trying to find fit.\n\nBut I also don't want to accidentally become a felon so here I am haha.\n\nWe are using a licensed money transmitter for our customer-side financial services, but part of our product is taking care of paying bills/fees on behalf of our customer which seems to be a legal/regulatory grey area in regards to money transmission...\n\nThis might be a dumb questions, but when a fintech attorney is crafting policy for a company and comes across a piece of regulation that has grey area pertaining to processes the policy will govern, how do they evaluate the ways the policy they're building could account for it?\n\nLike it is mostly looking up past cases to discern precedents? Is it reaching out to the regulators/enforcement entities themselves? Is there some kind of legal wikipedia that's trusted/followed by most legal systems that define the semantics of what certain legal terms/language conveys?\n\nAlso thanks for the link! Will definitely take a look.",

            "comment": "r/entrepreneur is a better place to ask this. Not all businesses being started are necessarily startups. Startups are designed to rapidly scale usually offering some novel service, product, or business model. So a run-of-the-mill dog walking/pet sitting business isn\u2019t a startup. But if you built a platform that connects sitters/walkers with pet owners and aimed to be THE place people turn to to get those services\u2026 then that would be a startup.",

I would use one of the existing dog sitting apps, provide a good service and get your price right and you'll be full in a month then just hire people at less than you charge to do the work for you. And train them well.\n\nAlso a lot of dogsitting stuff is word of mouth.\n\n\nDo that and once your full you can then think about a business, site etc and you'll already be profitable before wasting any time.\n\nPeople are desperate for good dog sitters.",

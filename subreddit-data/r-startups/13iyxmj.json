Do you prioritize metrics such as CAC, CLV, or ROAS? How do you leverage analytics and data insights to optimize your customer acquisition strategies and make data-driven decisions?",

What that is depends on the startup. \n\nAds are one of the most expensive ways to acquire customers, but can be effective later on once you\u2019ve tightened your audience and messaging. \n\nIf you\u2019re early stage, and offering a paid product, the main metric that matters is # of paying customers.\n\nMetrics are great, but really you\u2019re trying to find one one channel that will maximize growth in paying customers (MRR). \n\nHope that helps!",

However, it's important to note that the success of your digital advertising campaigns depends on a lot of factors including your industry, your target audience, and the quality of your ad creatives and landing pages. As for KPIs, we track CAC religiously and use it to gauge the overall health of our customer acquisition efforts.",

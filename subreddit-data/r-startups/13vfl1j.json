    "postText": "I'm in the early stages of developing a fintech startup, part of which would require users to deposit funds into the app. Upon preliminary research, I've realized that acquiring the necessary licenses to facilitate this could run into millions of dollars - a sum that's currently out of reach as we're still working on our MVP and have no funding in place yet.\n\nOne of the potential solutions I'm considering is partnering with a bank to bypass these licensing hurdles. However, in light of the recent banking crisis, I'm uncertain about the best way to proceed.\n\nWhile I anticipate that the crisis will be resolved by the time we're ready to launch, I'm interested in exploring contingency plans. In the event of a partner bank's failure, how could we ensure the safety of our users' funds? Are there specific safeguards or strategies we should consider to protect our startup and our users?\n\nIn addition, how would we go about finding a bank to work this? Is this something we should wait until after we\u2019ve secured funding, and then use our investors to help?\n\nI'd greatly appreciate any insights, advice, or shared experiences on how to navigate this situation. Thank you in advance!",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t know US too well, but you should be able to partner with a card program manager who works with a bank (card issuer) and card processor to allow you to brand and distribute your own cards. Check out someone like https://www.berkeleypayment.com/ who I believe also operate in the US. The rules around licensing are complex so consult an expert on that, but generally if you\u2019re partnering like this and your usecase is simple you might get away without one as the card is technically issued by the bank (it will have the bank\u2019s name on it in small print).\n\nBear in mind this is a really complex undertaking and not for the faint of heart and is particularly tough if you don\u2019t know financial services (which will make it tough for people to take you seriously). Happy to help more if you want to discuss.",

We've been outsourcing all our apps and have had success, but we recognize that to reach the next level we need in-house developers.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience finding talented iOS and Andriod developers willing to join a small team with a vision?\n\nWe have set up a site to attract talent ([https://www.fulminareholdings.com/services-7](https://www.fulminareholdings.com/services-7)) but have found it difficult to attract the right eyeballs. Let me know :)",

Devs like numbers, they don\u2019t like \u201cguess what I\u2019m thinking\u201d games.\n\n2. More polish on the web page. You guys are marketing and concept masters and your web page looks like an inexperienced graphic designer\u2019s first project?\n\n3. Devs get pitched all the time \u201cbuild this for me and I\u2019ll share it with you.\u201d Tell me about your team and why I\u2019d be an absolute idiot for saying no.",

These days no developer will apply for a job when they don't know how much they'll make. In fact, in some states it's legally required to list a salary range.\n* **Work Arrangement**. Is it fulltime? Hourly? Are there benefits? Does the candidate need to be in a specific location? These are the kinds of things you need to know.\n* **Who are you?** It helps if you tell the candidates a little bit about who you are and what you do. There isn't very much of that on the site. You need to get developers interested in working for you.\r  \n\r\n\nFinally, your pitch isn't in the right place. If someone is on your site, they already know about you. You want to attract developers who don't know who you are, and haven't been to your site. So you need to post in other locations.",

The developer would be doing most of the work and they would be the ones taking all the risk if the app does not bring in revenue (furthermore it is hard for me to gauge how much of a risk this is).",

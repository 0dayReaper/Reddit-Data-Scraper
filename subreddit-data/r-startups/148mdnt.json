    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm trying to make up my mind if the numbers I have from my invite-only period good or not. At what numbers would you consider something to be promising and at which stage of the funnel?  \nI'm building a long-term investments manager I always wanted to have but couldn't find, so I jumped almost straight to coding and posted invite links on some forums a couple of times at various stages of development.  \nI always got rather a positive feedback on these forums, as well as when talking directly with the users, but, the numbers, are numbers, so here they are:  \n\\- 17% of Landing Page visitors clicked the CTA  \n\\- 40% ended up with a sign-up (either to the waitlist or creating an account)  \n\\- 10% of users onboarded themselves and continue using it  \nSo it's 7% conversion rate, but 90% didn't see the value and churned. These numbers encompass 6 months of development, but the sample is relatively small (170 users) so I'm not trying to find any trends there yet.  \nSo, would you consider them any good?",

At some point you\u2019re going to need to figure out a monetization scheme but if you\u2019re happy enough in getting users and your runway is fine then that can be the focus with monetization later. Just keep trying to reduce churn. With more users you\u2019ll get a better sense of how they are engaging and see trends.",

    "postText": "I recently got connected with a founder. They have what in my opinion is a quite actionable business model and a pretty good-looking front-end of their website, but they lack the backend infrastructure to actually roll out their business model--once the backend is in place, the business is ready to go. I am invited as a part-time contributor for 10-15 hours/week to build up the backend of the website (obviously more hours for the first few weeks to build the core infrastructure). In terms of compensation, they are currently unfunded and they proposed a below 1% to 1% equity for my contribution and will be paying me when the funding is in place. I am new to the startup scene and would appreciate any insight into this proposal and the general outlook of the business. Thanks!",

They are not taking advantage of you if they are offering a fair market rate. \n\nYour big issue and the advice I see you getting is that you and the others think you\u2019re a founder.\n\nAre you a founding member of the company? If not - and if you want 20% of the company then make a pitch to them. \n\nBut I strongly suggest you do away with the idea of 10 hours a week of anything as a founder. You must breathe this business when you wake up and sleep. It must become your top professional priority. You willing to do that?\n\nLastly - if your role grows than renegotiate in 6-12 months. If you threaten to walk they will keep you if you brought the value they expected.",

Your contribution should be commensurate with the value of it to the company. Two areas that are important in tech are sales and development skills. All other skills can be bought for cash.\n- What are you putting at risk? Money on the table trumps hours worked and working full time trumps doing this as a part-time gig.\n\nThen it comes down to your own commitment\n- At 1% equity and 10-15 hours of time, how much time will it take you to build up this company? Whatever is the number, double or triple it because of unknowns in requirements as well as your own skills.\n\nLet's say you contribute 500 hours, which is 50 weeks. Is that acceptable to the founder, because that is nearly a year. What about two years? Will that still be acceptable to you and would you be as committed?\n\nInstead of thinking in terms of yourself providing the skills, think in terms of an anonymous person bringing those skills to the table snd you representing them. What would you tell them about the ups and downs?",

Noway.\n\nDid you crunch the numbers? 15hrs a week (I never heard of a founder needing this low of a number for planning/implementation/maturation of an entire backend solution).\n\n15hrs @ $XX/hr = Your Investment\n\nSo you work for 2 months, 8weeks x15hrs = 120hrs.  Working at McDonalds will get you $1600 for this time. As a backend dev you should be getting about $40 an hour.  So your real cost for labor is around $4800.\n\nEquity in a startup is the percentage of the company\u2019s shares that will be sold to startup investors.  So if they sell 1000 shares for $480,000, you would receive $4800.  And thats just to break even. Remember you are loaning them your services, they are borrowing that money/time from you and you need to be paid for that service too.  At that rate I would tack on another grand for those 2 months.  So in reality if they are not looking at getting $580,000+ for venture capital you are working for experience.\n\nBut then you have to ask yourself \"And then what?\" Are they transition you to an Full Time Employee (FTE)? At what pay scale? What benis? What does your contract look like? NDAs etc.",

For example, if the three of you were equal partners and on a 48-month vesting schedule, you would earn a little less than .7% a month or 2% per quarter. Create two or three targets that make the currently accrued shares locked in for your milestone-based cliff. You could even set a minimum and a maximum for each milestone, so you have the incentive to move quickly, and they know that you won't take as long as possible to rack up your cut.  The other option would be milestone-only-based vesting.\n\n\nThe benefit of this structure is any mission creep would mean that your additional time would accrue more shares.  And since you are not being paid, the milestone-based cliffs would guarantee a cut of the company, say 8% after a year.  If they want to keep you on like a partner, you would ultimately have 1/3 of the common shares.  Also, if the feel like they can do it on their own, they are not penalized for cutting you loose early.\n\n\nFYI - If They don't have themselves on a vesting schedule, either one could bail and have their shares for doing nothing and become Equity Spectators - a red flag that no VC would invest in.",

Figure out what hourly rate you think you deserve. If you think you deserve $30/hour and will be working for 100 hours, then you're effectively an angel investor handing them a $3000 check, so ask for a $3000 SAFE note.

Do you trust the founder?\n\nIf you understand the product you can probably derive the scope yourself. How long is it going to take you to build it? Can you do it part time? What\u2019s your current market rate?\n\nAnswer those questions first. Then you\u2019ll know the vault you\u2019re putting into the product.\n\nNow ask for a cap table. If the founder doesn\u2019t have one or won\u2019t provide it, run.\n\nIf you get the cap table, see where the shares lie, how many of them there are, if s/he has set aside shares for employee stock options, etc. This is some basic stuff that people with experience will have already thought through during their \u201cback office\u201d phase and registering the business.\n\nYou\u2019re going to have to do your own valuation of the product since there\u2019s no way they have a 409A yet. Ask the founder for their market research and their marketing budget and then refer back to your notes on the product. Make some assumptions about customer acquisition. How big could this business be in 1 year? In 5 years? You need this number to know how much equity to ask for.\n\nBottom line is \u2014 I would never take less equity than what my time is worth, and I\u2019d usually as for much more than that.\n\nIf you\u2019re a true co-founder, you can negotiate for more. If your a \u201cfounding engineer,\u201d I\u2019d personally aim to have that role be at or less than 5%. You need to understand the type of equity you\u2019re getting too \u2014 some forms have early tax implications, others don\u2019t. \n\nThe last thing \u2014 do you trust the founder? \u2014 is the most important piece. If you own part of the company, you\u2019re going to be attached to this person for years. Are they going to expand the scope and expect you to keep working on it? Can you put a trigger in your contract for more equity or payment if the scope expands? What\u2019s their track record? Have they run other companies before?\n\nSorry this is all very stream of consciousness, but it really bugs me when people randomly throw out numbers without showing their work \u2014 you would have ZERO position to negotiate from walking into the room saying \u201cthis internet stranger on r/startups told me 20%, so that\u2019s what I want.\u201d Anyone who asks me for comp beyond what I\u2019ve offered them better have done their homework.",

However, if you're building a crucial part of the business and taking on a lot of risk by working without immediate pay, you definitely can expect more. Equity isn't just about the percentage, but also about the potential value of the company. 1% of a company that becomes the next big thing could be worth a lot. Also, make sure to understand the vesting schedule and any other conditions tied to the equity. It can get complex, so you might want to get some legal advice.  \nIn the end, it's a negotiation, and it's important to have an open conversation with the founder about your expectations.

In terms of the offer, it's a bit of a mixed bag.  \nOn the bright side, it seems like you'd be playing a pretty crucial role in the company by building out the backend. That's big! It's kind of like being the wizard behind the curtain, making everything run smoothly.  \nHowever, a 1% equity for such a significant contribution feels a bit light, especially since you're not getting paid yet. It's even trickier considering the startup hasn't secured any funding. In other words, you're being asked to take on a lot of risk.  \nOne thing you could do is to negotiate for more equity or agree on a better deal once the funding rolls in. Remember, it's okay to advocate for yourself and what you believe your work is worth.  \nBy the way, have a look at the [Open Source CEO newsletter](https://open-source-ceo.beehiiv.com/). It's chock-full of interviews with founders who've been through it all and have loads of valuable insights to share.  \nAnyway, take your time to think it through, maybe talk to some more experienced folks if you can. Good luck!",

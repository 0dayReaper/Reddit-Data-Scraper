Im seeking some advice from someone who has been there on going from minimum viable product to beta testing through first paying customer. \n\nAfter that I have venture capital interest to scale. \n\nSo anyone out there who can help me out?",

Our market (Czech Republic) is dominated by just few software suppliers, so all what you need is to just approach the 3 biggest. The issue is, that the EMR databases in our country are not unified, so  in our case you should focus on us ... the insurance company, since we are the only once who needs to be informed about all the prescriptions that have been given.",

            "comment": "&gt; to integrate with EMRs\n\nHave you worked in the industry before?  This can be tremendously painful and difficult...or it can be fairly easy.  Varies widely by who your target customer is.\n\nAlso, along those lines, I'd make sure that you don't accidentally trap yourself.  A common pitfall is to find a particular customer profile that is on an EHR that is easy to work with; deploy; happily declare success... \n\nAnd then realize that all the money is in big hospitals and/or Epic, and that you're really no further than you were on day #1, except now it is almost worse because you have some random small customers on irrelevant EHRs that you need to continue to support.\n\nTaking a step back--\n\nI don't know anything about your biz or product, so I'm not saying you're doomed.  Just encouraging you to make sure you really, really believe in your GTM + integration motion, because healthcare generally has very slow sales cycles, so it is too easy--due to slow feedback--to spend 1-2 years on something before you realize that it is just a bad idea.",

Ive worked with both Epic and Meditech and my business model is a subscription or transaction base.  This is a project I\u2019ve been working on and off on for about 3-4 years. I\u2019ve gotten as far as incorporating with an intellectual property lawyer, discussing patents and copyright and trademark protection. I\u2019ve written a formal business plan and started to gain interest of a local venture capital company. \n\nThe biggest roadblock is that I have not progressed to the point of having a paying customer to show interest / revenue. I\u2019m very confident in my concept, where I lack confidence is my coding skills. It\u2019s just me developing and while I\u2019m fine tinkering with things and getting it to work as proof of concept,the healthcare industry takes no chances. \n\nMy model is similar to that of Doctor First, a subscription based solution for medication management. My product will take a patients list or medications and a list of their problems / diagnosis and return a list of medications matched with indications, a list of medications they have no indication to be taking, and a list of problems for which they should be on a medication but aren\u2019t.\n\nSo I\u2019m trying to figure out how to integrate with the EMRs as opposed to being a standalone application. Insurance companies would also be very interested in my product as well. What I don\u2019t know is how to approach a potential customer or beta tester to work with. Given the sensitivity of the information customers are hesitant about anything that hasn\u2019t already been proven. Kind of a catch 22 situation.\n\nAnd as I said before,  not being a developer by trade, I\u2019m not versed of writing an application programming interface for my product.",

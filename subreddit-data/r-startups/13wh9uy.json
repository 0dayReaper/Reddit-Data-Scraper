But most startups are nowhere near profitable and rely on growth and valuation, not profits.\n\nSo startups are a speculative investment, that's why they get funded by private investors and not bank loans because it's too risky for the bank, how then, does a high-interest rate affect the startup's ability to raise money? Did VCs borrow cheap money on their side to invest in start-ups?",

            "comment": "Opportunity cost. Why invest in start ups when you can make similar returns in less risky investments? This is hyperbole but the reality is the vc funders are saying that to themselves and that means vcs have to be more cautious with their capital accounts. It's cyclical and will likely change but smart entrepreneurs are pruning any and all fat to weather the storm of low capital until things turn around. The largest expenses in startups is labor.",

Investing in a startup is high risk, and the reward stays the same.\n\nSo, the impetus to invest in startups is reducing because risk-free investment is getting juicer.",

            "comment": "The simple answer is that higher interest rates negatively impact equity based investments. Startups, stocks, anything that is equity based will on average be negatively impacted because the relative risk:return has gone down. The company you invest in has a range of probabilities for success. The ROI on saving your money goes up with interest rates. The ratio of company value:saving value has gone down.\n\nI think what we are seeing is people's risk appetite shrinking dramatically (that's the goal of raising the interest rate, lower inflation which is done by lowering spending). I can get 5% interest at a bank now vs near zero before. I'm more likely to to keep more money earning interest safely than gambling on startups. If I am still gambling some money on startups, I will also be more selective in terms of what I think will have the best returns. With less money on the table, companies looking to raise later rounds better be looking financially sound.",

They were way too cowboy during that time period with what they invested in... Things now are more reasonable.",

Many average VCs return less.\nSo a good VC can only deliver 3-4x the risk free rate today. When interest rates were 1% they were returning 15-20x the t-bill rate.",

But in truth, in a portfolio of 50 companies you get maybe 15-20 that are zeros and 15-20 that are even pushes, and 5 that are 3-4x, which basically just get you back to even on your 15-20 wipeouts.\n\nThat means you have maybe 5 left to carry the whole day for you. And you need to hopeyou have a reasonable stake in those, that you do follow-on rounds to maintain a good stake, etc.\n\nAnd in chasing this type of model VCs do a lot of dumb stuff. A friend of mine was told by a VC that he saw that they were only being thought of as a $200mm or so company, so were not investable. $100k at the time would have gotten them 10% stake. Almost like clockwork, 2 years later company sold for $150mm with no further raises. So, the VC was right... But they passed on a 150x opportunity.",

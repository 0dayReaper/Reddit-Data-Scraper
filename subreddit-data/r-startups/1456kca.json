    "postText": "Some context: I've been building a fashion technology start up for the last year - part-time, bootstrapped with personal savings. To date, I've invested in operational support, marketing, and product/engineering. \n\nNow I'm ready to bring on a technical co-founder. \n\nSince it's a bootstrapped start up, should a co-founder be obligated to contribute some seed capital? The goal is to make sure the co-founder has some skin in the game. Thoughts or suggestions for other ways to show commitment? ",

Not usually, no.\n\nAnd if they *are* contributing capital in addition to their labor, then they should have additional stake in the business to represent that (e.g. as a SAFE or convertible note).\n\nFor the most part, I'm of the mind that if someone is putting in a significant amount of time/labor without taking a salary, and their only compensation for that is equity (with a standard vesting schedule), then they inherently *do* have skin in the game. They have a lot to gain, and they're taking a risk by putting in labor (presumably very valuable labor, if they're a co-founder) without taking cash out for that labor.",

Otherwise it\u2019s too tempting for them to walk away when things get tough. And they will get tough. Even Uber and AirBnB faced existential threats in their early days. The FedEx founder had to gamble in Vegas to make payroll.",

    "postText": "I've been running a cleaning company for the past 7 years and I've been striving to revolutionize the home cleaning industry for the last 3 years. \n\nHowever, I haven't received funding nor have I really pursued it, but it has always been on my mind. \n\nMy ultimate goal is to transform my current business into a technology-driven company. But I've been facing difficulties in generating the necessary capital from the existing business. I'm at a crossroads and need your guidance.\n\nIs it still feasible to attract investment for my current business, considering its history? Or should I consider setting up a completely new venture and migrate all customers and assets as my initial investment for the first round of funding?\n\nFurthermore, the current company operates and appears as a traditional cleaning service, while a new venture could start off as a tech-based cleaning company. This transition might address some of the challenges I'm currently facing.\nI would greatly appreciate your insights, experiences, and advice on which path I should pursue. Thank you!",

            "comment": "I'm not a startup expert, but whether you keep it under the current entity or a new one, I think that having run a business operating for 7 years is only a +, even if it wasn't a tech startup. \n\nMost of tech bros are only focused on raising funds and then a good part of them run those funds into the ground. You'll have the image advantage of someone who knows how to keep things sustainable and market fit.\n\nNow, the challenge will probably be showing how you'd go about transforming a conventional model to a highly scalable one. Again, if you have the solution, you should have a better credibility due to running one for 7 years.\n\nCheers",

A really saturated market yet they\u2019ve raised over 100m, because what they\u2019re doing actually makes sense in this day and age.",

Integrating tech into the business is what requires a lot of money which I haven\u2019t got, because I started out as a cleaning company that\u2019s what my business is perceived as, which has a direct impact on what I\u2019m trying to achieve as people don\u2019t know any different. So positioning myself as a tech company with a SAS product to make onboarding easier, right now it\u2019s done verbally as that\u2019s all I can do. Which isn\u2019t scalable. \n\nSo the question being, do I go out and get funding for my existing company\u2026 or set up a new venture? \nThere\u2019s going to be pros and cons to each, I can think of a few but posting to this subreddit I thought someone would have a more technical approach as to which route to take that would produce a better result, that I\u2019m unaware of.",

Just talk to the company they\u2019ll usually be happy to make tweaks for a customer. Depending on the size \n\nI\u2019m curious what tech enablement is going to do to scale the business so much.

Don't mess with your existing business, there are random legal implications that tech companies face.\n\n2) Depending on how ambitious you are: find a tech cofounder for business B (have a shotgun clause with a 4-year vesting schedule and a 1-year cliff). The goal is to build products for Businesses similar to A\n\n3) Fundraise. Your quick pitch is: I a leader with  \"x\" years of experience faced \"y\" issues. I partnered with my amazing cofounder \"z\", and together we built {comapny name} to help us solve {list of issues}. We want to sell to other cleaning businesses: {market size, TAM, etc} this is the subscription price of {price}, we can reach {timeboxed goals}. We need {$ amount} to achieve {current goals}\n\n4) sell tech to other cleaning companies. Pith: I am not a salesperson, but a fellow founder. Speaking owner to owner I built this product to solve my needs. This is what it can do for you. You in?\n\nPs. I did something similar for laundrymats. Best bet I ever made.",

    "postText": "Back story: We're a match making service that connects freelance professional pilots with aircraft owners/operators on a ad-hoc trip by trip basis. We launched our business in early 2022 with nothing but a spreadsheet and a cell phone. Having moderate early success we have been profitable from day 1 but could not keep up with demand because our processes were very messy.\n\nWe went back to the drawing board and decided a lot of our manual processes could be automated and a lot of the pain points resolved (such as non or late-payment) by building a self-service platform that is in essence a two-sided marketplace. Fast-forward 6 months on development and the MVP is ready to hit the market.\n\nSo what's the problem? Well in order to automate &amp; make a true 2 sided marketplace work we've had to adapt some processes making them different to current industry practices. Most notably we require use of credit card only and a deposit is charged up-front to book a pilot. Current industry standard is a verbal contract (or just general understanding) with invoices sent after the trip is completed, paid by check or ACH. This new upfront payment is different to their current accounting practices &amp; some customers are afraid of our cancellation terms, even though they'd have to pay them in our traditional workflow anyway- they feel more exposed now.\n\nThere are many advantages to our platform for all parties- but where do I start in my mission to convey this?  And how do I educate all users on the subtle deviations from industry practices? \n\nIt's still very early, we've only been in beta for a couple of week, just seeking some words of wisdom from someone who's been in a similar situation.\n\nTLDR: Launched a new platform that may have changed our product market fit. Where do I go from here?",

First when the second model was shown did people \u201cunderstand\u201d that $299 is a great deal for a bread maker.\n\nHow this translates to your industry:\nYou need to apply the same principle of contrast to your product, in the same way hotels have multiple rates depending on how you pay. If you pay upfront without being able to cancel you get the lowest rate, if you pay in advance but can cancel anytime you get the average rate if you don\u2019t pay anything just book it without a credit card then you get the highest rate. \n\nLong story short: \n1. Book a pilot and pay later $999/hour (fax required) \n\n2. Book and pay now $599/hour (online forms)\n\nKey is in making the offer you want them to use the easiest and best deal.",

Also what's your customers' biggest pain?\n\nre: cancellation \u2013 insurance as in a standalone entity that does risk underwriting (including your competitors businesses), not just the terms, Flexible terms for your customers, from what I've got from your post, would be perceived same way (no sale). Don't get me wrong, I get where you're coming from, it sounds like it just doesn't move the needle for your customers.",

It's a massive headache and the pool is getting smaller- other pains are then collecting pilots documents, processing their invoice/receipts, W9/1099 to name a few.\n\nI'm not sure how to make an angle on insurance that way. Business aviation is so last minute, cancellations happen a lot. And most pilots just suck it up and take the hit because they don't negotiate this stuff up front and they'd rather keep a client for the long haul.",

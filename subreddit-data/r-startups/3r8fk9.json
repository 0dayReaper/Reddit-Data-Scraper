    "postText": "**TLDR:** In the last 3 1/2 years I've built the following companies (revenues):\n\n* [Home cleaning](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zj4nto0cvf7bbsm/Screenshot%202015-11-02%2012.09.26.png?dl=0)\n* [Subscription box service (wetshaveclub)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/30q5b7v49prie50/Screenshot%202015-11-02%2009.04.24.png?dl=0)\n* [Lawn care company](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ygp9c5skqndtjyd/Screenshot%202015-11-02%2012.39.24.png?dl=0)\n* [Saas product (launch27)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kts435yebu5nga3/Screenshot%202015-11-02%2012.11.58.png?dl=0)\n* Another Saas product (Groovejar)...\n\nAnd combined we're doing over $2.5 million per year in revenue.  \n\nAnd many of you know, I did it in a crazy transparent way right here on Reddit and completely bootstrapped with a couple hundred dollars in seed money.\n\nToday I want to share the **website strategies** I use to improve conversions, but from the angle of a website visitor looking for a simple home cleaning.  \n\nThis is the **stuff that works**, regardless of the industry we're in! For some of you it's going to be so simple as to be a waste of time, but hopefully some folks get something out of this!\n\n\n**How to turn more website visitors into customers!**\n\n(Read time: ~15 minutes).\n\nGrab your favorite puffy slippers and kick back! I\u2019ll get right to it.\n\n----\nI love simple, predictable businesses, that require no magic or fancy technology. And those are the type of companies I continue to build.\n\n----\n**Backstory: Setting the Stage**  \nSo I wanted to attack this from the angle of a visitor to your website.  This visitor happens to be someone needing cleaning service (cause I\u2019m sure you guys are tired of wetshaveclub stuff), but I promise you the stories are the same regardless of what you\u2019re selling:   You have someone that is looking to solve a problem, you\u2019re selling something that solves that problem, yet somehow your website gets in the way!  [Click to meet Rosa, and see the problems she's having booking service](http://imgur.com/a/YpXFJ)\n\n\n\n**Strategy 1 for More Customers: Use more images**  \nHere\u2019s the thing, people rarely read a full paragraph online.  Even the most compelling news story is skimmed, and best believe people are skimming on your website as well. So we keep things as light on text as possible while setting the mood with images:\n[Click to see a quick example of images we use](http://imgur.com/a/Y7UwV)\n\n**Strategy 2 for More Customers:** **Use more videos**  \nSo this one will automatically set your website apart from about 90% of your competition.  Videos are super easy to make, and they completely raise the trust level on your website and engage the customer at a much deeper level than just having traditional text testimonials.  These could be short 30 second snippets like the one Rosa might see, or [longer form ones like we did for wet shave club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE30CfMxnak)\n\n**Strategy 3 for more customers: Borrowing Credibility**\nSo this one is pretty straightforward but you\u2019ll be surprised how many websites either miss this completely or hide these logos on inner pages that no one ever sees.  For us, if it does not happen on the homepage, it could as well not happen at all! We borrow credibility from other sites that have mentioned us that Rosa would immediately recognize, and this would increase our standing in her eyes right away.  Simple stuff but it works. [Click to see how we borrow credibility from bigger sites](http://i.imgur.com/2c6jWof.png) \n\n**Strategy 4 for more customers: Answer Objections**  \nSo far so good, and really we\u2019re only a few seconds in real time as Rosa starts to take in our website.  She\u2019s probably feeling okay at this point but there are still certain high level questions she has in our mind, that we\u2019ll call \u201cObjections!\u201d  These are the same objections that sales people have to overcome in a sales call, except in this case we can overcome them in many cases with very simple markers like these: [Click to see how we use symbols and short text to overcome objections](http://i.imgur.com/XfcYyTP.png) \n\n**Strategy 5 for more customers: More human faces**  \nAs Rosa gets further and further down our website page, we\u2019re looking for more ways to make deep connections.  One way we accomplish this is with human faces.  People connect with people. Not with pictures of mops and gloves or lawnmowers or whatever tools you use to deliver your service.  Think about it, when was the last time you felt a personal connection with a wet mop?\nSo we aim for at least 5 or 6 people that are super happy. [And that\u2019s why we hit Rosa with images like this](http://i.imgur.com/xR73lPQ.png)  \n\n**Strategy 6 for more customers: Start Checkout Above the fold**\n\nAbove the fold is just the area of your website that your visitor sees when they first get there and before they start to scroll.\nIt's usually your main image with text to show what your website is about. IMAGINE YOUR HOMEPAGE IS AN ICEBERG.  The only part of your website you can guarantee people will see is the part that's sticking out of the water.  Assume they're only going to see the top of that iceberg, and make sure you don't waste that opportunity to get them moving along your sales funnel.  For us, [we start the checkout process as soon as Rosa lands on the page.](http://i.imgur.com/4YpY0oP.png)\n\n**Strategy 7 for more customers: Short One-Page Checkout** \nHave a checkout form where you asked the customer 9 questions when it could have just been 5? You just [cut your conversion rate](http://www.marketingexperiments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/results.jpg) from 13% to 10% and increased your cost to acquire a customer by $2 . *The longer your form, the less money you make!* Keep things simple. \nFor us, we do a simple, one-page checkout for every website and [keep things as simple as possible for Rosa](http://i.imgur.com/dQYdyP6.png). \n\n**Strategy 8 for more customers: Better design and customer experience**   \nSo the way I see it, building a business is like being in a boat race across the Atlantic. Fortunately, most of your competitors enter the race using a website that is akin to an ugly handmade dingy, with a few half-broken oars, and a ton of leaks that require them to stop every few minutes to scoop out water. Sad to say a lot of these folks won't make it.  We make sure not to create a website and make it just as shoddy as the ugly handmade dingys the competition use. I don't launch until I have a freaking speedboat. A Professionally designed, cohesively branded website, with good copy, and a simple process to convert visitors into buyers.\nI want to make that race as unfair as possible.  \n\nSo while the competition is running something like this: http://rcmoving.com/  \nI launch with this: http://backpackmoves.com/  \nThey don't have a cohesive brand? I create a solid appealing brand.\nThey don't have a video? I go get one.\nThey don't have online chat? I set up online chat. And on and on...\n\n**Strategy 9 for more customers: External Reviews Brought on-Site**\nSo this is not unique to local services by any means.  Any big ecommerce store that can see data at this level knows of this phenomenon: 1) Customer comes to the site and wants to buy 2) Leaves the site to look for reviews and 3rd party feedback and 3) Comes back to buy (Or Not)!  Our goal here is to remove the need for them to leave for more research by providing the most pertinent 3rd party reviews right on site. [Here's what Rosa sees as she is shopping around the site.](http://i.imgur.com/RapSHh3.png)\n\n**Strategy 10 for more customers: Upsells &amp; Add-ons**\nSo this one is kind of a no-brainer, but we're looking to increase our average transaction size in any way we can. And one way is to upsell at checkout. Rosa, as she's checking out will have the opportunity to add extras and complementary services. [Click to see extras we offer Rosa at checkout.](http://i.imgur.com/Tzzq16n.png)\n\n**Strategy 11 for more customers: Cart Abandonment and instant discounts in exchange for the sale**\n\nSo this is one that we use liberally in as many places as possible.  We give customers a reason to book service right away.  Not later, now!  And it\u2019s usually in the form of an instant popup that offers a discount code in exchange for an email.  This not only improves conversion rates but it also allows us to gather the email as well (just in case the person does not checkout).  This works like a charm, because either way, we\u2019re increasing our chances of creating a relationship with the visitor before they go.  [Click to see this in action](http://imgur.com/a/qitHm)\n\n**Strategy 12 for more customers: Exit Monitors**\n\nEmails peeps. Little messages that are the closest thing we have to free ATMs in the internet marketing world.  And these are ATMs that you go back to over and over and over again, insert some nice words with beautifully designed images, hit send...and wait.\nIf done right, sometimes in mere minutes, money flows out the machine!\n-\nThere is no single better converting medium that a well-nurtured email list.\nNothing beats it.\nNot search, not social media, not display ads. Nada.\nAnd it's not even close.  [Click to see how we use exit monitors to grab customer emails just before they leave](http://i.imgur.com/rmyD6Mq.png).\n\n**Strategy 13 for more customers: Refer a Friend**  \nAnother absolute no-brainer but this works like a charm.  Nothing beats a recommendation from a client so we set up a way for customers to get a credit off future service for each client they refer our way (the new client gets a discount as well).  [Here is the email we send out to get this moving.](http://i.imgur.com/oL21PDS.png) \n\n**Strategy 14 for more customers: Show other customer transactions**\nThis is a fairly new strategy we've seen on travelocity and other major ecommerce sites and we figured we would try it out.  And it works like a charm. It's basically a way for customers to see that OTHER customers are also buying stuff, and it gives folks more confidence to get moving.  [Here is what our friend Rosa would see.](http://i.imgur.com/oyAlKmO.png)\n\n**Strategy 15 for more customers: Built in Recurring revenue**\nWe try to build a recurring component into every business.    Even if you're selling one-off items like cars, try to upsell a monthly service package of some sort to keep that relationship alive.  And one way to structure this is to give different commitment levels with higher discounts based on the lenght of the commitment.\n\nSo for example: A 1 year subscription is $19.99 per month, while a 3 months subscription is $24.99 per month.  This works beautifully, helps to increase conversion rates for longer commitments which in turn makes our cash-flow smoother and more predictable.\nAnd of course if you can have your recurring transaction happen seamlessly or with one click, you\u2019re way ahead of the game. [Here\u2019s what Rosa sees when it\u2019s time for her to book another service!](http://i.imgur.com/Dcj96oP.png)\n\n**Wrapup**\nSo if this is executed properly it ends with a happy Rosa having more time for her friends because we delivered a seamless website experience.  [Everybody wins!](http://i.imgur.com/Zao21B6.png) \n\nSo hopefully you guys see (and sorry if this was simplistic for some of the internet marketing gurus out there), that building a successful online business is far more than just throwing up a website and pulling up the brink trucks to collect the cash.  A great website is just the beginning, a lot of what we do to get over that hump happens with the tools and ideas I laid out here.\n\nGood luck!!!\n\n------END OF CASE STUDY!  \nThis wraps up the  case study but I wanted to add this section because I think it may be helpful for some of you guys as you are getting out the gate, and what would be one of my case studies without a rant? : -)\n\n**FEAR IS MOSTLY A LIE**\n\nAnd I say mostly because it's useful in some very specific scenarios. Being chased by lions in the plains of Africa, fear is a super helpful thing. It triggers adrenaline glands to make your body do some amazing things.  \n\nBeyond situations like this though, and especially for new entrepreneurs fear is a lie. It's by and large a cognitive error that exists in our heads that essentially creates a fantastically negative story about all the bad things that happen if your business fails.  \n\nBut as someone who has gone through business failures before, here's what really happens: Nothing.  \n\nLike Kevin says, fear of a business failing is like being afraid of the dark. There's nothing there.  \n\n**So what do I do after I try something and it doesn't work?**  \nI wrap things up, go catch a movie or something, and by the next day I'm thinking about what's the next thing. Because in reality, in the big scheme of things none of this matters.\nThe earth will still take a year to revolve around the sun, the tides will still come in and go out, and the next business opportunity will still be there waiting to be attacked.\nI can hear some folks say \"well I don't have much money so I'm afraid of trying something and losing the money\". Meh. If you start businesses like we do, you're never in more than a few hundred to a few thousand dollars to start something. We build businesses that heavily weighted towards success being determined by time/effort not some huge wad of cash.\n\n**And so what if you lose a bit of money building something and failed.**\nMany of you dropped $50K -$100K on college without blinking an eyelid, and came out not having the first idea how to actually earn a living that is not dependent on having a boss. But somehow the idea of $2K to start your own business with a chance to fully control your lives and the thought of losing that is crippling.  \n**Makes zero sense.**  \nYou probably paid $2k to comcast in the past 6 months anyhow. lol\nBy the way, the reality of business building for me wasn't launch a business and win! It was more, launch, fail, launch, fail, launch, fail, win, win, win. What happened with all of those failures? I got better, accumulated a host of experience, learned a lot and now wins come a lot easier. So for $2k I end up learning a shit ton more than I learned in 4 years and $50K at college.\nAnd that's the win. \n**Launching a business is the cheapest MBA you'll ever get!**   \n\nSo at the end of the day, look to launch, get failures out of the way, learn, and get to winning. The real world is where it's at. With folks like myself and Kevin Pereira and others here that have gone through this so many times, and are open to share, you get to reduce the chances of failure (embrace that), but you have to get closer to the not giving a fuck attitude we have, and enjoy the experience for what it is.\n\n---------\n**And because we're at that no-fear point, you can watch us launch a new product in real-time!**\nSo we're launching Groovejar and if you're curious to see how we launch stuff, and yes this is a part of our launch, you can [follow along here](http://launch.groovejar.com/l/VTQ1) or [signup here](http://launch.groovejar.com/r/VTQ1) to check out our new set of conversion tools, many of which I mentioned above. \n\n-You'll see everything we do, visitors, signups...all updated in real time. Watch us win or fail...haha but watch it! : -)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n",

They are tools so when a customer buys, they will be \"impulsed' to buy. Got it and awesome idea!\n\nWhat I'm wondering if this: how do you even get people to come to your website in the first place? I'm sorry if this is a noob question but I'm not a pro and just an aspiring entrepreneur. \n\nI'm assuming that it's using a variety of resources like:\n\nGoogle Adwords\nFacebook Marketing\nBuying email lists\nSEO\n\nBut if so, here goes my point. All that costs so much money so as a startup, how do you even have the money to pay for all those marketing costs? I hope you see this message when you log on!

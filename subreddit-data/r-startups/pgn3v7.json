    "postText": "As someone whose been huge into tech forever, but was never smart enough/had enough motivation to learn to program, if you cannot sell it\u2019ll be tough to find a cofounder. \n\nI currently sell a semi complex Technical SaaS solution, and mastering business development/sales has allowed me to find a brilliant technical cofounder. \n\nOur startup product isn\u2019t even developed but I\u2019m still cold calling future prospective customers and collecting emails, and this motivates him to continue programming and building the software. \n\nIf you can\u2019t code, learn to sell. Hot take - all a startup business truly needs to survive is a seller and a coder. Everything else comes next. \n\nGood luck!",

The problem is that good developers and CTOs are very expensive.\n\nI was a CTO of a couple of startups right out of college and the mentors we had said that I should be getting majority vested equity early on since I was so integral to the success of the company. The other owners were always upset, but I said I would be willing to take a competitive salary. When they heard what that was, they agreed.\n\nBut that's why you setup a vested equity plan with a timeframe to reformat it. After 3-5 years, the CTO role might be significantly less important.",

Back in the DotCom days, we had a shortage of people and we hired people based on what they said they could do and other things.  Most of them had no clue how to code.\n\nThe thing about coding is that you can just google answer, glue them together and have something that works.\n\nYou can buy a $100 tutorial and \"learn to code\".\n\nFact is, you might be able to buy a $100 tutorial, modify a few things, and have a working solution, it can happen.\n\nPeople like to ignore all the background work that it takes to be a professional developer.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nI think this works best:\n\nYou have a problem with your car, you get estimates of $1K to fix it... you fix it yourself.  You might be able to find the online answer that actually works and you could be fine.  You've replaced the water pump and the car works great now.\n\nHowever, it COULD be the case that you didn't seal something, or bleed the air from the system... now you overheat the engine and it's now going to cost $5K to fix.\n\nIt's a risk, if you're good, you can reduce that risk.  If you compare the cost of hiring a pro, vs the risk of failure, sometimes the risk is worth the reward.\n\nAlso, some don't have the money to pay to have it fixed by a pro.",

They have an ability that the average person does not, which is to be able to have an understanding of the product/service they are selling and communicate it. As long as a developer has the ability to communicate, they will always sell better than salespeople. That's not surprising. However, if you were a salesman from the start, you would not know your shit as much as you do now, so that might not have worked as well as you think it would.",

Most tech job boards and salary tracker apps don't even list my role and collect no data on it. Yet technical writers are often expected to single handedly orchestrate all of the internal and external content / strategy needed to install, configure, and use the product being built and sold. \n\nEvery job I've taken has left it up to me to build and maintain external knowledge bases, push for better release management, advocate for more internal partnerships and transparency. Yet we're invisible and hardly ever included in key meetings unless we force our way in. \n\nI used to dream about being a director of content or product documentation but the reality is most places want one, maybe two tech writers that get shoved under a manager who has no clue what you do. Maybe a edu/training manager, a support manager, marketing director, vp of product marketing. Meanwhile your equivalent in any other role is a director and gets the pay.\n\nI talk to vendors, I plan and execute content migrations, set up publishing tech stacks, develop processes for release messaging alignment... You get the idea. Anyway, I've started to trial running my own marketing agency where I get to focus on web copy for site overhauls and landing pages and it's way more fulfilling. Instead of being ignored I'm actually asked for my opinion and asked to be involved in more and more (ads, ebooks). I'm scared of leaving my day job but it will eventually happen because I see so much demand for the agency work and I feel less squashed by irrelevant managers who openly admit they have no idea how to support me and simply let me self manage yet get really nowhere. \n\n/End rant",

I am still in college, and I feel completely lost cause most of my friends just party literally everyday while I am trying to make something out of myself here. Now that doesn't mean I don't have fun, but I have also want to start something since my dad is also a business owner. I come from a background of web design and marketing. Should I find what I am good at and double down on that? Or should I learn how to code to build a MVP for my SAAS to seek funding? I did learn how to code in the past, but I am not really sure if it is for me to be honest. I never really had a class or a mentor to guide me through. But I think I have the drive to possibly learn front-end development to at least build a MVP or porotype going. Its crazy and amazing how you build something like this [https://useplink.com/en/](https://useplink.com/en/) with code.",

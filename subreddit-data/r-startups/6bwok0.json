    "postText": "Here\u2019s an honest view of a short lived online business. In the end, after all fees, ads, costs etc, I lost a total of $7.42 or $0.12 per bottle sold.  \n\n**Initial Idea**  \n\nBack around the end of March, [McDonalds Canada announced](http://news.mcdonalds.ca/en-CA/manual-releases/Get-ready-Canada-Big-Mac-Filet-O-Fish-and-McChicke) that they would be selling packaged sauces in grocery store, including Big Mac Sauce, Filet-o-Fish Sauce and McChicken Sauce. The relevant social media posts were filled with mostly excitement, but also anger that it was only going to be Canadians that had access to this product. The sauces were immediately available, and no information about availability dates were provided, as well, no costs was provided during the announcement.  \n\nI\u2019ve read many stories online where people capitalize on situations like this and make a bit of money, so I thought \u2018Why not me?\u2019 I had some time to think about the idea since the sauces weren\u2019t yet available in stores. The idea would be to buy sauces in grocery stores, then package them and ship them around the world. Pretty simple right.  \n\nI talked with a friend that was going to help out as I was dreaming of this being a huge success and having tons of orders to ship out. He works shift work so I figured he\u2019d be good to help. In the end he didn\u2019t do anything so that\u2019s the end of that.  \n\nWhile as time went on I kept thinking about my plan and finally put together a website. Initially it had a form gathering contacts with the basic message \u2018We\u2019ll notify you when they become available\u2019\u2019. I paid for some Facebook ads, targeted people with an interest in Big Macs and/or McDonalds (yes those exist). I managed to get 6 people sign up. This was underwhelming but I persisted. As this Facebook ad was running, the sauces became available in stores and I rushed to put together a store front.  \n\nFor the store front, I used Shopify. Shopify is a great product that helps with everything needed to run a store front. I used the $9/month plan that allows for just the use of the \u2018Buy Button\u2019 that I placed on my site. At this point I loaded up some more Facebook ads and started taking orders.  \n\nThe first and second day I maybe had $100 in orders each day. This was good and I was thinking this might work. On the third day, I woke up and had $800 dollars in order notifications on my phone (Shopify has an iPhone app that alerts you when someone places an order). I was very excited. Wondering why they all came over night, I noticed many orders came from Australia. So I then targeted some Facebook ads to Australians only and orders kept coming in.  \n\nDay 4 comes around and orders drop considerably back down to $100 or so. And continue to drop day by day. I realized that people were getting turned off by the shipping costs and/or times. Shopify is great because it does all the shipping costs and calculations for you. When checking out, it shows the customer the cost of various shipping methods (using CanadaPost) and an estimated shipping time. For one bottle of McDonald\u2019s sauces (cost $10 to the customer), the cheapest shipping method was $12 and estimated to take between 28 and 84 days!!!! Realizing that not many people would want to wait this long (or pay more for shipping than the product) I started to target North American users (remembering that the sauces were only available in Canada). This didn\u2019t lead to any appreciable increase in sales.\nAfter a week or so, orders had basically stopped and I decided to shut down the ads and try to sell the remaining bottles I had in stock. Here are a few notes on the whole operation and final costs and incomes.  \n\n**Facebook Ads**  \n\nFacebook Ad manager has improved greatly over the past while and it\u2019s a super strong tool for advertising. It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you know what you are doing, you can get some good traffic. My totals, for the various ads I placed were 2,987 clicks and 113,670 people reached. My cost per click was $0.08 and I spent a total of $236.48 on ads. My click through rate was 2.39%.  \n\nOne takeaway from Facebook Ads is that it will take up a lot of time if you plan to be present on the ad boards. You\u2019ll get a ton of people commenting on the ads (sometimes good stuff, sometimes bad stuff). If you want to respond to people, it takes time but Facebook has made a specific iPhone app for handling this, so you can do it on the go. As well, many people will talk about buying products, but then never buy.  \n\n**Google Adwords**  \n\nWith a Shopify account, you get a \u2018Spend $35, Get $135 Credit\u2019 with AdWords. I set up some adwords, spent $75 (some my money, some credit). For this I got 68 clicks, 1,553 impressions and a good click through rate of 4.38%, an average CPC $1.11. The dashboard tells me the ads converted once, but I\u2019m not sure I had it set up correctly the entire time.\nUnless you have done this before, I wouldn\u2019t suggest using two ad platforms at one time. Managing both became a distraction so I turned off the Google Adwords, even though it was using free credit.  \n\n**eBay**  \n\nWhile doing research, I noticed many people had the same idea as I and started to list the bottles on eBay to sell them. I noticed that many were selling for more than I was selling for which was $10/bottle. I decided I could list on eBay for $13 (to cover eBay listing fees etc) and undercut the others and sell a bunch. Shopify is great because you can manually enter orders and keep track of them in the same place. One thing to note here though, don\u2019t enter the email address when creating the contact in Shopify. If you do, Shopify assumes you want them to email them which can confuse customers when they get multiple emails from different stores.  \n\nAlthough I did get a bunch of orders from eBay, it did create more work since I was managing both platforms. As well, eBay\u2019s UX is absolutely terrible. It\u2019s very outdated and hard to use. I imagine there are add on tools that people use, but the vanilla eBay platform is terrible. Like ad platforms, I don\u2019t recommend selling on multiple sites. Find one you like and stick to it.  \n\n**Inventory and The End**  \n\nGetting and keeping product is what lead me to close down the store so to speak. I didn\u2019t want to get stuck with a ton of left over inventory, so I sort of bought in small batches (10 bottles). At first bottles were easy to come by, but after awhile other people started to realize the product was available and buy it from grocery stores. I would go to a store to grab a bunch and it would be out of stock. So I would drive around the city trying to find more only to find one or two bottles left. I was spending more and more of my time driving around finding bottles.   \n\nWhen I started this, I promised my wife it wouldn\u2019t take up too much time. This was just a side project, and we have a toddler and a newborn at home. I was spending too much time in the basement working on the site, preparing orders and driving around. I wasn\u2019t seeing the profit I wanted, it just wasn\u2019t justifiable to continue on. If someone is reading this, lives and Canada and wants to take over, let me know.  \n\nI'm not walking away empty handed.  I learned **A TON** during this whole process and has opened my eyes to the possibilities online.  I'm going to try some dropshipping as I won't be stuck with the same problem of finding product to buy, although there will be other issues. \n\n**Costs**  \n\nHere is a final breakdown of all my costs and sales for true transparency.  \n\n*Costs*  \n\nSauces $287.28  \n\nFacebook Ads $321.89 (above amounts were in USD, this is CAD)  \n\nShipping $748.40  \n\nAdwords $35.00  \n\neBay Fees $44.09  \n\nShipping Supplies $15.00  \n\nDomain $9.84  \n\nShopify Fee $12.24  \n\nTotal Costs $1,473.74  \n\n*Income*  \n\nSales $1,466.32  \n\n**Profit -$7.42**",

Someone even said they pay $0.50 for one each time and therefore it was cheaper to do that.  I did the math for them and it was like 5x more expensive then just buying a bottle.",

It was mid-late November when I placed the order. I was stoked to make a couple hundred bucks on them, and was going to take advantage of the discount that I got by shipping them through the corporate shipping (which was allowed)  \n\nWoot took a long time to ship them, and as soon as I saw that they were on their way, I listed them on eBay. I said that they were guaranteed in time for Christmas. I figured that there was little risk as I had a couple weeks before the rush. The auctions were set for a week, and they were quickly bid up to nice healthy amounts. Win!  \n\nOr so I thought. The train carrying them derailed somewhere in the midwest, with no estimate of delivery. Auctions ended, and people wanted tracking numbers, and they wanted them bad. They started to get pretty mad, and I just kept promising them that they'd be there by Christmas.  \n\nWhen they finally arrived, I had to ship this big boxes almost overnight to get to their locations. They all made it by the 22nd/23rd of December. I don't recall the exact numbers but I think I ended up making about $10 after weeks of stress, angry emails, and risk. Last time I did that. ",

            "comment": "Awesome post. Just curious and am proposing a hypothetical: since you saw such high demand in Australia, but the individual shipping costs were then hurting that demand, what if you shipped the product in bulk to a partner in Australia and let them handle the domestic distribution?\n\nAlso, the grocery stores you're buying from are ordering the sauces from McDonald's co-packer / distributor. If you could somehow build just 1 relationship with whoever handles inventory at these grocery stores, you could buy the product bulk from them at a discount (compared to buying bottles individually off the shelf). Although this would be tough if McDonald's mandates a maximum order per grocery store per week/month in order to inflate the demand by limiting the supply. But I'm curious if this was a possibility? Especially if there was no maximum mandate and if you could get it from a non-corporate grocery store where the inventory people had more leeway?",

I was in discussion with a guy for a bit who wanted 250 bottles or something.  Shipping was going to be $400.  So it is small on a price per bottle, but tough to a. source that many bottles and b. find someone willing to front the $$$.  \n\nThe sauce is manufactured by Kraft, so I'm not sure who distributes.  Probably tough to get in on that deal, no clue though.",

These distributors would sell to you if you had the proper paperwork (that you are a reseller, i.e. a grocery store). Or as I mentioned, just talk to the inventory/procurement folks at the grocery stores and see if they will sell it to you by the case for a lower-than-retail price. \n\nUsing this model + everything you devised would be a good way to get another run off the ground. The trick is finding a product that will generate sales. I'm in the US, based in the DC metro area, let me know next time you have an idea if you need a US partner, I'm game. And I have a reseller's license (as a restaurant owner) so I can source product directly from distributors and manufacturers.",

Was busy over the weekend.\n\nI think the idea's proposed by others within this thread would be the best option... that is, find a reshipper in certain countries.  I would send bulk packages to them and they would reship internally within their country.  Likely could reduce costs considerably, although shipping was paid for by customers, but I imagine more people would buy if shipping was $6 vs $16.  However, as I mentioned elsewhere, shipping one bottle across Canada was just about the same cost as shipping it to Australia, the shipping times were just lower.  So perhaps the above wouldn't work in some countries.",

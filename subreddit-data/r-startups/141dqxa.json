    "postText": "I have a really good way of executing the business and I doubt it will fail, however, does anyone here happen to know if rich people would be happy to use websites or mobile apps (for the beginning).\n\nI have currently started on the IOS version however if I make a website I will get it to release MUCH faster. Need opinions. Not paying any devs I am bootstrapping myself.  \n\n\nEdit: feels like people don't understand my question. I know the business well and the audience, I don't need to explain it and all I wanted to know was - \"do rich people use websites?\". Simple yes or no would have sufficed. Thought I could come here for some reconnaissance but apparently I have to know everything before I come here. ",

Do we need seperate account or we should work with our personal account in early stages. It seems people more trust on personal accounts",

A dedicated account for your startup helps build a brand identity and gives you a place to share updates, and news, and engage with customers directly. Your personal account, on the other hand, allows you to share your personal journey as a founder. People do often trust and engage more with individuals than brands, especially in the early stages. So, it's not an either/or situation. Use your personal account to build a network, and share your insights, and your startup journey. At the same time, build your startup's brand on its own account. They can work hand in hand to help grow your startup. Good luck!",

He has accounts for NomadList and RemoteOk that I know of AND a personal account (levelsio) for his social media (mostly Twitter I think) and by far he tweets more on his personal account about his startups and has WAY more followers (200k?) on his personal account than any of his startup ones (40-50k on any one I think).\n\nI think it depends on your goals. Do you want to speak as the Brand or are YOU the brand and speaking as yourself to promote the company under your brand will create more rust because it's from a human, not an entity.\n\nI think both can be successful, but you need to define your goal so you can follow through with your Social marketing strategy correctly.",

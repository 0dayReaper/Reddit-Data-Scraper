    "postText": "It seems that there are many different video conferencing products and they are all pretty indistinguishable from each other so it doesn\u2019t seem like Zoom really benefits from proprietary technology. Furthermore, Zoom doesn\u2019t really seem to benefit much from network effects since there isn\u2019t much lock-in and it doesn\u2019t really matter which one you use. So what makes Zoom a multibillion dollar company? Is it it\u2019s branding or am I getting something wrong about their network effects?",

It\u2019s likely attributed to switching costs associated with moving to a new platform, combined with general market acceptance - meaning, nobody\u2019s gettin fired for choosing Zoom. Said differently, the  critical mass of users achieved earlier on really helped them establish themselves as the standard (leader) for video conferences. I think what helped them grow fast and establish this footprint was certainly due to some network effects, and a good GTM strategy that focused on getting into high growth companies/startups - and growing with them",

There are also hosting requirements and integrations that need to be setup for such a switch.

Video quality can be spotty on meet but I have more authentication/video issues with teams which is a bigger problem in the grand scheme of things. \n\nI liked zoom when it first came out but it seems to have stalled out from a product perspective.

Not only did excel have more robust formulae 5 years ago than Google sheets does today, they have VBA, power query and a lot more. You'll be surprised how much data analytics and storage still happens over excel. \n\nPowerPoint is much better than google sheets with how detailed and specific you can be. Again, google doesn't do this well.\n\nThese two are the core of large corporates. \n\nDon't use word that much but even here, word has much more granular formatting and hidden symbols VS google. \n\nTeams is super slow but has excellent integration with other Microsoft products and part of the same suit. In our company, all documents are permanently stored over SharePoint and generally accessed via teams as the navigation interface with files, chat, and other key tools in one place. \n\nWhat can I say man.... This is what Microsoft specializes in and charges pretty penny for. Meanwhile google has some tools to keep you in their search business. \n\nIt sucks because I don't want to pay for ms office for home use but I often feel limited by free tools like Google or Libre office.",

They are not the same. \n\nI\u2019ll just say, for 99% of the collaboration that happens at my software company, Google Suite is more than powerful enough. The guys over in finance get Excel licenses, but the data science team uses much more robust tools than excel for their research. Excel is unnecessarily robust for most employees and also not robust enough for true analytics work. \n\nGoogle Slides is completely satisfactory, I cannot really imagine what other features one might need to create useful decks. All the formatting is there, it\u2019s integrated with Google Drive, searching across the company cloud is easy. Collaboration is seamless, there are often 7-8 people simultaneously working in the same deck, adding and resolving comments, suggesting edits, it\u2019s great. \n\nSame goes for Google Docs. In my 8 years using Google Docs for work I have rarely come across any employee trying to accomplish something that isn\u2019t supported by the platform. It just works, it\u2019s super intuitive and lightweight.\n\nI pretty much forget I have Google Meet because it\u2019s so seamlessly integrated with my calendar. It\u2019s not even an app, just opens in the browser, smooth screensharing capabilities and I don\u2019t need to worry about different windows opening up with toolbars like I do with zoom (I have never used teams). \n\nAnd then I just live in Slack - although, obviously not a Google product. There is no equivalent really. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that Microsoft products are bad. I spent many years using and loving Microsoft. But the idea that Google Suite is somehow not full-featured enough for large enterprises is just completely untrue. That reputation is very outdated.",

The fact that it simply works is by no means a coincidence.\n\nEdit: they've also worked on it (purely engineering) for about 2 years before releasing, which goes against the usual advice everyone gives that \"if your product works well and your website has a favicon, then you've launched too late\".

It's functional and unoffensive and that's good enough.\n\nPart (2) is harder to notice, but Zoom's underlying video tech is significantly better than the competition.\n\nBack before Zoom was dominant, my company had to screen share some animations where quality was important.  I downloaded and tested every major video conference solution, and Zoom had the highest quality and highest framerate by a significant margin.\n\nThat's a pretty niche case, but as a whole, Zoom's video and audio quality is better than its competitors in ways that make the whole experience better in not-always-perceptible ways.",

Every startup and tech company I know has switched back to Zoom because it works. Have meetings with less than 25 people? Yes, Meet and Teams work fine. Beyond that - or another company we closely work with uses Zoom - we end up with Zoom.",

What do you mean I didn\u2019t need to plug in my computer? \n\nAnd sharing my screen by just opening zoom app and pressing share without joining the call? Get out of here. \n\nNow the same company after 2 years shifted to bluejeans because of cost and we all got used to it. After 1 month of bitching, we forgot about zoom. Now I\u2019m in a different company and we use zoom. I still prefer zoom over anything else.",

But since I don\u2019t have a problem + co-founder that I want to go all-in on yet, I assume that for my internships and full-time job, working for a pre-PMF startup (as opposed to working for big tech or a VC company) would be the best option for me?\r  \n\r  \nBut what if the startup (that I\u2019m working for, post-grad) fails? Is it most optimal for me to hop to another startup (assuming, once again, that I don\u2019t have a problem + co-founder that I want to go all-in on)?\r  \n\r  \nAnd how would your answer differ if I was technical vs. non-technical, which would in-turn affect the work (and pay) I\u2019d be doing for the startup?\r  \n\r  \nBasically I\u2019m wondering what the most optimal decision is for a current student and aspiring founder \u2014 who wants at least a bit of job security.",

            "comment": "Working for a pre-PMF startup provide valuable experience, as you'll likely wear many hats and get a firsthand look at the challenges and rewards of building a company from the ground up. If the startup fails, which can happen, it's not necessarily a bad thing for you. Failure is a part of the startup world and there's a lot to learn from it. You could then take those lessons to another startup, or use them to start your own venture when you're ready.  \nAs a technical, you might be more involved in product development, while a non-technical background might lead you towards roles in operations, sales, or marketing. At the end of the day, if you're passionate about the startup journey and willing to embrace the uncertainty, it is a rewarding path.",

There is so much to learn in that aspect. I'd start with just any normal job and hang around some working class people - to understand the struggle outside these 'tech bubbles'.\n\nAn experience that is hard to outline without actually doing it yourself.\n\nMost 'founder' are people who identified an idea they can fix while working in their normal day to day jobs - then rolling with it until success or outright failure.\n\nIf you're in the mindset that you're scared to lose a job - do not go anywhere near trying to start your own company, you're no ready.",

I was largely in your same shoes. \n\nHere\u2019s what you should do: find a serial entrepreneur that is launching a new business. Someone who has done it before and is taking another swing. \n\nDo whatever you can to join their team. The education alone will be worth it for your future endeavor. Stick with them 3-4 years, learn everything you can, make all the right connections, endear yourself to them and get their trust. \n\nThen when you\u2019re ready to make your move, you know how/what great looks like, you already have a network of early stage people, and the founder will likely help you get your first funding (if you need/want it).\n\nWhere might you find such a person , you\u2019d ask? Go to your local VC group. Talk with the analysts. Find which companies in their portfolios meet those criterion. Ask for an intro, tell them your looking for an internship. \n\nAs a serial founder, I\u2019ll tell you Id take a smart, motivated, hungry intern any day\u2014I could put them to work on any number of things, and as long as they\u2019re humble and willing to keep learning, there will be no shortage of jobs to be done (you will always have a role).",

Some discernment might be necessary to get you on a good path. What is it about being a founder do you think you like?\n\nTo answer your initial question, take any job that excites/motivates you right now and try to get paid well to do it. Knowledge, experience, and relationships will set you on the right path to finding problems, knowing how to solve them, and selling those solutions to others.",

            "comment": "I think either working out something yourself at small scale now or joining a startup isn\u2019t a terrible idea. Just make sure if you do take a startup role that it\u2019s actually helpful and more than just a job where you stay within your world of tasks, because what\u2019s the point of just one more job? \n\nYou need to get something that will help you get more of an insider view. There\u2019s cons and pros between earlier and later startups, you can decide which you like best.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though, imo. Bear in mind im young as well, student too, under 22. In my opinion, you shouldn\u2019t (ideally) work for a startup and rather just do work for yourself. Here\u2019s my reasoning. \n\n1) You\u2019re likely not yet compromised to a full time job as most adults are, which gives you a lot of flexibility with what you can do. \n\nYou will have 35-50 of your hours weekly compromised for the rest of your life until you either retire or work for yourself, which may never happen. \n\nStarting a business is heavy in terms of time investment, so yes or yes you\u2019re looking at your future full time job + whatever time you can fit for your own venture, forever, unless you one day figure out your bills while you develop this side of you\u2026 which is unlikely for most people. \n\n2) A startup role sure will give you insight\u2026 but it\u2019s essentially a job as well unless you\u2019re in a decisi\u00f3n making position which is highly unlikely. It\u2019s like helping a soccer player polish his shoes, rather than going into the field yourself. You have 0 clue how to actually play. It\u2019s the truth. \n\nMore likely than not you\u2019ll be told what to do and if the owner is experienced or has potential you\u2019ll never get the true insider view, more so a job hyper focused on trying to understand the business but never truly being part of what runs it.\n\n3) Youre skipping failing. Maybe I\u2019m biased here but I consider my failures a fundamental part of my progress. I think failing is vital for founders to be able to systematically deal with. Early lessons are common and niche further as you\u2019re more experienced in your field you\u2019re working. \n\nStarting a business is hard and you\u2019re probably gonna fail time after time after time until you find something you\u2019re good at. You\u2019ll also never see it coming. You\u2019re most likely not gonna take these failures while working at a startup\u2026 you might *watch* them, but never truly understand them like if done by you. To me, this is the biggest problem.\n\n4) You\u2019re gonna invest this mainly bill-free and flexible time you have before you go into the workforce after college at a literal or almost job. \n\nYou\u2019re not actually doing decisions yourself probably. So. When you\u2019re out, got an \u201cactual job\u201d, yada yada, and THEN you decide to finally start something on your own, check 1). 2) as well, you didn\u2019t actually learn to run a business. 3) You still will have a lot of inevitable failing ahead that working for a startup may not as reduce as much. Consider what outcome you expect concretely from working at a startup. Do you want to come out inspired? Knowing how to run a business? Knowing how to scale? Knowing how to go from idea to something existing? That\u2019s important if you\u2019re gonna invest time. Don\u2019t just \u201cgo in\u201d with no direction. Also consider, considering all I said, is working for someone else the best way to accomplish that? \n\nLike most people, you might fail for months (maybe probably years) or forever. Just the truth. You\u2019re gonna be mid 20s or underway to 30 by this point. Life goes fast. I also have a personal belief that what you do in your 20s significantly sets you for life, and by the time you\u2019re 30 It\u2019s hard to change your already set track. If you happen to be persistent enough and work enough after all this. Your first significant success isn\u2019t unlikely to think may happen closer to 30+. Or, maybe sure. Maybe your startup prepares you so well that within 1-2 years of graduating, mid 20s, you\u2019ll score a successful business your first or second year. Unlikely though as I said. \n\nTLDWR\nI say go work for yourself. Figure things out the hard way. You don\u2019t need someone to hold your hand through stuff. It\u2019s alright to be clueless. It\u2019s alright to fail. Watching someone fail will never be the same as doing it yourself. Failures are important. Use this time for you. Whatever you choose good luck! And take everything with a grain of salt\u2026\u2026 :) I\u2019m young too. Though I do run my own website that I was only able to get up after a lot. So I may be biased as well with the do it yourself part.",

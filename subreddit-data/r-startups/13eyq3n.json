But other variables are likely to be more carefully considered, such as the teams experience (eg, 2nd time founder with prior success), complexity of technology (eg carbon capture tech), alignment with investor thesis, or whatever else may be what the accelerator is willing to weight higher.",

            "comment": "Accelerator quality really varies. I would strongly recommend you speak to a founder in a previous cohort and ask them what they thought of the one you are applying to. \n\nIf you are a in a strong position going into the accelerator (could be great traction / great team / domain expertise / trendy area), it may be possible to negotiate down the equity component, if there is one. Also worth a check with the founder you speak to.\n\nOn equity, remember early raises hit you the most down the line. Make sure its worth it for your startup, that its going to bring something tangible (even if its focus and access to mentors). Finally if they are using a note/safe, learn how these mechanisms work (discounts/caps etc) to ensure your getting a good deal.\n\nAccelerators tend to be flexible with company stage. Wouldn't worry too much about it unless they have stated some requirements to the contrary. Usually opportunistic when a good startup comes around.",

Ideally you should go when you can leverage the accelerator's connections to turn their network into potential customers and further launder their reputation to gain enterprise/big customers who will not enetertain you if you are small indiehacker.",

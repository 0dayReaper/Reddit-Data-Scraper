    "postText": "**The blog was a little heavy and pretty dense at some parts so I thought it would be helpful to summarize what they said here.**\n---\n\n\n The full post is linked below. The company was Konsus, a YC alum. \n\nThey mention that the main reason startups shy away from automation is that they assume that they don't have enough capital or development resources to automate. \n\nTheir solution (or \"hack\") to solve this problem as a lean startup themself was through two services, Kloudio and Zapier. \n\n**Even though some large companies like Netflix, Quickr, and Medium use these tools, they have non-enterprise plans that startups can easily afford! Both these services require no coding so your business guys can handle them ;)**\n\n\n-\n**1. [Kloud.io](https://www.kloud.io/?utm_source=RedditPost1&amp;utm_medium=Reddit&amp;utm_campaign=ContentMarketing_reddit)** \n\nKloudio automatically brings relevant information from databases into Google Sheets or Excel without any complex IT infrastructure or knowledge. \n\nSo the non-technical business guy in your startup can easily pull up only the information he needs (sales, ratings, client feedback, etc) right into Google Sheets (it's literally a Google add-on) so he won't get confused. He can do this with no coding knowledge, and the reports can be scheduled to update automatically every day/hour/etc, so the data will always be in sync and correct. It's pretty awesome! Compatible with Excel as well obviously. \n\n**2. [Zapier](https://zapier.com/)** \n\nZapier moves information between all sorts of webapps automatically through workflows called \"Zaps\". For example, you can set a Zap to trigger whenever an email is received with a file attachment. The zap can then automatically upload these attachments to Dropbox, and then alert chosen people on Slack of the upload. Again, no coding at all. Pretty cool! \n\n\nI can see both of these services being HUGE time savers for most startups/small businesses, and looking at the prices they seem affordable for even early stage startups. \n\n\nGot this info from [Konsus's blog](https://www.konsus.com/blog/beginnners-automation-guide/), a Y Combinator alum.",

It would give me stats on my Stripe subscriptions and alert me of free trials, but now Zapier alerts me and utilizes Postmark for a 100% deliverability rate (Baremetrics dropped the ball and missed a lot of notifications). \n\nI can also have it auto populate Google Drive spreadspeeds and create many of those graphs for me, automatically. \n\nI also have it send welcome emails to new subscribers, notify me of new payments, email customers if their payment was declined or if their card is expiring, etc. \n\nIt also replaced a lot of RSS feed software I'm using, Zapier can create RSS feeds from just about anything. \n\nCan't wait for them to release Authorize.net support. Help me vote for it! https://zapier.com/zapbook/authorize-net/",

For security, we would look at the from address and make sure it matched the headers in the email, then we'd identify the mime type of the attachment(s) and make sure they were a file type that made sense, then they get scanned for malicious code. If everything looks right, they go into the folder and we use them. We only process from senders who are on our \"whitelist\" so it's a little more controlled. Of course, this took 5+ hours of my development time to set up so not necessarily the recommended route...but I can't get nigerian princed.",

Building a solid user auth system is actually very easy IF you know what you're doing and use industry-verified methods. Scanning for viruses, on the other hand, is probably not something you should do yourself  (we use a third party service).",

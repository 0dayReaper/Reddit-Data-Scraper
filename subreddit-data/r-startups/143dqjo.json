    "postText": "Hey there , recently I had the guts to finally start my SaaS journey, yet the problem is that I dont know to validate the product because despite the fact that I have built a landing page with a cta to join my beta list discord server yet, I dont know how to drive traffic because this is my first time. I am overwhelmed and I need your thoughts on which is the best marketing chanell for my phase. I am trying tiktok content but it takes a lot of time to get feedback and I am trying cold dms on reddit. Are cold dm's on reddit worth it, if so give a bit of guidance on how to do cold dm's",

Find a specific person (anywhere) who very likely has the problem you solve and talk to them directly. You need good reason to believe they are the right person to talk to - and tell them when you reach out. Ask them to be your first test user. If they are not the right person, or don't want to, find out why. Then try another person who is a better fit.\n\nIf you cannot find 1 user, then you have problems with the idea.",

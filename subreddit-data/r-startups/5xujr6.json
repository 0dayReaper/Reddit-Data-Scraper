I guess, that many topics will be obvious, but still it's cool to listen to folks like Jan Koum (WhatsApp), Patrick Collison (Stripe), Steve Huffman (Reddit), Adam D\u2019Angelo (Quora), Alex Schultz (Facebook) or YC team.\n\nThey don't have an open registration yet, but I hope to check out  this course.",

I created /r/ycmooc a few days ago which is a place holder for /r/startupschool if I can get it (mod has been inactive for a year).  They liked the idea and offered to do moderation support as well.  \n\n\nI'd like to get some traction going, any help you could offer would be greatly appreciated.  Hopefully we can get support and maybe offer questions at the live office hours, or even get ama's(paging /u/kn0thing and /u/samaltman). ",

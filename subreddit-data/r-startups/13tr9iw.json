Or is not as valuable until you actually have a product and are trying to improve usability and meet users needs with the actual product?",

Most super early (like, just starting no funding type of startups) rather quickly have something busted out. They will (or should at least) just focus on getting their minimum viable product out there then iterate off that. \n\nOnce they get funding is usually when they should look more towards UX. \n\nThat\u2019s just in my opinion. As a product person, I focus on a good UX and UI but I won\u2019t lie if I said I didn\u2019t cut some corners since it aligned better with the strategy needed. I can always go back and change those items but when building an MVP, you gotta look at speed.",

Is it a legit question and I just don't understand something in the context or is it just a question with the buzzword \"UX\" thrown in because someone at your current company is in charge of UX so you think it is a single aspect of a company?\n\nDoes it mean:\n\n\\- \"When does a startup need to solve a user problem with a good experience?\" Immediately.  \n\\- \"When does a start up need a decent looking website/online presence that helps users find and want your product/service easily?\" immediately or no one is going to know or care you exist.  \n\\- \"When do I need to hire someone to focus on UX for me?\" Maybe never if you want to stay lean and a single person startup - BUT you will have to do any UX too on top of whatever else you are doing for your start up.  \n\n\nI genuinely do not understand this question and i think OP will get better answers if they can clarify the ask.",

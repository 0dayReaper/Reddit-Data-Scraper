    "postText": "Ok so i say america needs tricycles especially for like people in rural areas or states with no trains and bad bus routes. this is similar to keke napep in nigeria or rickshaw in india. the tricycles can be electric with a battery lasting the whole day or a designated shift and then after that, the driver takes the keke back to like the warehouse/garage and parks it at a charging station. the drivers can be people of low income or homeless, ofc they will get training and everything and later on the keke could even have its own lane like bikes do. its smaller than a car of truck so can weave through traffic easy, it can get you exactly from point a to b unlike a bus and is cheaper than an uber. there can be like a price ceiling so the keke drivers cant charge over a certain amount and they may not go out of a certain radius to keep the ceiling viable. for example, if someone flags down a keke and wants to go from imax to walmart, that can be as low as $2 or even lower but not higher than like $25 and that would have to be for a large distance\r  \n\r  \nKey Points:\r  \n\r  \nAffordable and eco-friendly electric vehicles\r  \n\r  \nIncreased accessibility, especially in areas with limited transportation options\r  \n\r  \nEmployment opportunities for individuals from low-income or homeless backgrounds\r  \n\r  \nPotential for designated lanes and improved traffic flow\r  \n\r  \nPrice ceiling to ensure affordability for riders\r  \n\r  \nPositive impact on economic growth and reduction of carbon footprint\r  \n\r  \nI feel like the idea has some potential but it might be silly because it is more seen in developing countries and Americans may not want such a change yk? Anyways what are your thoughts? I think it would work best in cities like Tulsa, rural areas etc\r  \n\r  \nSome questions can be like:\r  \n\r  \nWould it be appealing and accessible to different segments of the population, including those with lower incomes or limited mobility options?\r  \n\r  \nHow important do you think affordable transportation options are for economic growth and social mobility in your city?\r  \n\r  \nAre there any potential drawbacks or challenges that I should be aware of?\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nPS: I will post this elsewhere for other thoughts",

So existing cultures and preconceptions mean people say, oh that will never work. Most of the internet businesses we have now people would have said they will never work.\n\nSo your idea is great, is it the right service for the target audience maybe, maybe not. Can you educate people and get them to adopt it, who knows. Keep trying this is a great mindset.\n\nMy dad was saying about shared taxis like in Israel for years. Then uber tried them in London and they failed because they didn't implement them properly. Still a great idea. \n\nGood luck",

Minimum wage is higher in most states and cities, but let's go with federal.\nYou'll be lucky to get more than 3-4 miles in that time on your electric tricycle. \n\nRealistically a small fraction of that when you consider other costs and the fact that they're not going to have paying customers instantly waiting everywhere.\n\nThere is absolutely no way your numbers work in rural areas or small cities where everything is spread out.",

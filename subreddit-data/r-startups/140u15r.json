    "postText": "My spouse and I are finally doing the thing and starting a food truck. He has worked in restaurants for years and will be running the day-to-day operations, and I am working on the back-end stuff like permitting and budgets. We will be borrowing a sizeable amount from our families to get it going, and I am trying to figure out the best way to structure our business. I think a partnership LLC is the way to go, but it looks like we'll have to hire a lawyer to draw up an Operating Agreement. Would it be simpler to leave the business in his name only? Would that be a terrible mistake that would hurt us down the road? Is there a way to set this up without an attorney? We are and will be operating in Idaho.",

            "comment": "Even with an attorney it should be pretty easy and cheap to set up. Going with an attorney is a good choice for protection long-term. Not just between the two of you but between you and any consumers or anyone who might get injured in some way by your business. This is one spot you do not want to skimp just to save a couple hundred bucks.",

They also shouldn\u2019t be solutionizing in the first place\n\nEDIT: TY for the award!",

Very hard to both code, be strategic, plan, and communicate effectively internally/externally. You can't be great at all of it. And you shouldn't have to be early on.

I happily speak to random people on the internet. Why is this so hard?",

    "postText": "Two days ago, my cofounders cited personality differences and said they no longer wanted to work together, removing my access to all company documentation. Last we spoke, they said I had no right to anything &amp; they would not acknowledge the \\~30% equity.\n\nI was in charge of developing the product, but I also ended up curating all of the marketing materials, discovering investors &amp; developing business / operational strategy. I have 10 years of domain expertise &amp; they're both fresh out of undergrad.\n\nThey're currently trying to raise pre-seed funding. With my contribution, I was certain the product would raise $600K/$6M valuation over the next week. This is such a backstab, as there is a huge vc pitch happening today.\n\nI have tried to reach out to no response. I have documentation of my contributions over 4 months, including a timestamped export of the cofounder chat dating back to the start, including the 1000s of documents/links/media that were sent between us. This includes a contract which they pressured me to sign on predatory terms (which I said i'd review with my lawyer before signing - that was to happen on Monday). I also have access to all my cloud files (stored on a personal drive), and proof I paid for the website &amp; marketing materials.\n\nI've retained legal counsel, but at this point i'm looking for advice from others experiences. What's the best course of action here?",

            "comment": "Here's the magic. When you get your lawyer involved, this pretty much immediately ends any fundraising, VC interest, etc.\n\nNobody will touch a company where one of the foundational founders has begun legal action. This has to be disclosed in any due diligence.\n\nThey might think they are being cunning, but as soon as they run any of this past their lawyer they will realize this isn't something which they can just wait for it to go away.\n\nYou don't need some lawyer who is going to spend 1000's of hours on this. One letter to them from a lawyer and their fundraising will either grind to a halt, or they will lie about it to investors, which your lawyer can send a followup letter to them saying, something like, \"We are uncomfortable having a stake in a company where investors may be unaware of legal action being taken. Thus we're going to rat you out to your investors.\"\n\nI have a friend who was owed a fairly modest amount of money in this sort of situation where they just declared his stock void. When all was said and done, the leverage he had by launching legal action at exactly the wrong time resulted in their paying out more than they would have, had they just paid out the money in the beginning.",

Their lawyer will probably want you to sign something confirming you don\u2019t have any claim to anything, and in exchange, you\u2019ll probably get paid for whatever you put in, with zero equity on the table. They will basically want to make sure you are entirely severed from the business and the vesting schedule is there to help them do that.

The advice you're getting below is good - have a lawyer send a cease-and-desist letter and then start letting them know you're willing to take what you want, but they have to release you from the contract (which you NEVER should have signed - lesson here, never sign anything without a thorough review from legal counsel and/or IP attorneys, advisors, mentors, etc.). There are a lot of questions here, however - what, exactly is the \"IP\" - a patent? A copyright? What is the product? \n\nAlso, if they balk or don't answer, I'd just take what is mine and let them know you will market it - since they don't feel obligated to honor agreements, neither will you. That should get some response. If your university has a tech transfer department, check with them to see if they have mentors/advisors for student companies!",

The Statute of Frauds says that they have be written if they are to be performed further than a year in the future (eg delivery of goods) but do not apply generally. Especially if there is some reason for why the agreement is not finalized.\n\nPartnership: In many jurisdictions in the US, a business partnership can be created even without a formal written agreement. If two or more people carry on a business with the intent to share profits, that can be enough to establish a partnership. If a court finds that a partnership was formed, the partners generally share equally in the profits of the partnership, regardless of how much work each partner did, unless there's an agreement stating otherwise.\n\nFiduciary Duties: If a partnership was formed, the partners have fiduciary duties to each other. This generally means they have to act in the best interests of the partnership and not take actions that would harm the partnership. If your cofounders ousted you and are trying to continue the business without you, they may be breaching their fiduciary duties.\n\nIP: Shared if done under the business.\n\nNDAs/Non-compete: Need to be signed to apply, but there is still a duty to the business partnership without anything signed.",

If you believe in the idea and want to work on it on your own, favor this one.  You did a bunch of work in consideration for equity.  The law really doesn't let you make contracts where one party gives something to the other for free.  No consideration = no contract = all the work you've done belongs to you.  \n\n* A cash payment.  You'll have to do some calculus to come up with a number based on what you think you can actually get out of them.  Too high and you'll scare off investors, who will recognize that any investment will go in one door and immediately out the other.  Based on the fact that they are fresh out of undergrad, seems unlikely that they'll personally have deep enough pockets to buy you out.  \n\nYou'll also want to make sure that if they wind down the company (possibly with the intention of starting a new company that does the same thing) you'll get rights to all the intellectual property you've made for them.\n\nYou have good legs to stand on here.  Impress upon them that legal action will bring fundraising to a halt.  You might not have a big legal budget, but I'm betting your budget is bigger than theirs.  The threat of a drawn out battle should make them play ball.  \n\nAs a negotiating tactic, I would think about which of the three options you really want and then concoct terms for the other two that are onerous/excessive to direct them to your desired option.",

Can one really be worth 30% of the company's current and future value on such a short period of time?",

            "comment": "So from some discussion, I think ChatGPT actually had some rather valuable points that I did not see elsewhere here.\n\nYour claim:\n\nEquity Stake: If they had a verbal or implied agreement about a ~30% equity stake, this might still be enforceable, even if there's no written contract. Proof of this agreement can come from various sources, including correspondence, meeting minutes, and even the behavior of the parties involved.\n\nIntellectual Property: If they were the primary developer of the product and creator of marketing materials, they may have a strong claim to the copyright and other intellectual property rights related to these assets. However, if these were created as part of the planned company, the other founders might also have rights.\n\nPartnership: In many jurisdictions, a business partnership can be created even without a formal written agreement. If it can be shown that the cofounders carried on as a business with the intent to share profits, a court might recognize this as a de facto partnership, which comes with rights and obligations, including possibly a share of the company's assets.\n\nFiduciary Duties: If a partnership was formed, the cofounders have fiduciary duties to each other. This generally means they have to act in the best interest of the partnership and not take actions that would harm the partnership. If the cofounders ousted them and are trying to continue the business without them, they may be breaching their fiduciary duties.\n\nMoving forward:\n\nClaim your Contributions and Equity: You should assert your rights, in writing, including your claim to your equity stake and your contribution to the intellectual property. This is best done in consultation with your lawyer who can help ensure that your rights are effectively asserted and protected.\n\nConsider Mediation or Arbitration: If a lawsuit seems too costly or time-consuming, you might consider alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation or arbitration. These can often be faster and less expensive than court litigation, and can sometimes lead to more flexible solutions.",

They will most likely fail, as most firms do after pre seed raise. It burns now but chalk it up to experience and move on. No amount of lawyering is going to unfuck this situation.\n\nIf you decide to compete don't do it out of spite - you will fail and waste even more of your life trying to rectify a mistake with another mistake. You'd only want to do that if you can really be married to a bigger role and stay committed to pivoting around pre-PMF concept to build a business.

Pursuing this would be complicated, expensive, and not guaranteed that the prevailing party would get their legal fees covered. You might end up paying more in legal fees than you win.\n\nYou have two reasonable paths forward:\n\n1) if you love the idea still, pursue it yourself with or without better cofounders (and sign an agreement this time ;) the same way you can\u2019t do anything to your cofounders, they can\u2019t do anything to you.\n\n2) if you are over the idea, move on, and if they ever do anything with the company (ie big liquidity event) find a lawyer to sue them on contingency (no legal fees except a % of winnings). Note: if they do this to you in reverse (it sounds like you\u2019d be the more likely to succeed if you pursue this), they\u2019ll probably get some money from you, but do you think zuck is bothered by a 300m settlement?",

It's a tough spot to be in, and it's definitely not what anyone hopes for when starting a business with partners.  \nFirstly, good on you for retaining legal counsel - that's an important step. Your lawyer can help you understand the legal aspects of your situation based on your local laws and the specifics of your case.  \nRemember, any verbal or written agreement you had with your co-founders regarding equity and responsibilities might be important. That documentation you've gathered will likely be very helpful in determining your contribution and rights to the company.  \nIf you can, try to have a clear and calm discussion with your co-founders to resolve this issue amicably. You never know - they might be open to negotiation once they realise the magnitude of the situation.  \nWhile you're at it, consider getting insights from others who've been in similar situations. The [Open Source CEO newsletter](https://open-source-ceo.beehiiv.com/) often shares experiences of founders who've faced all kinds of challenges. You might find some useful advice there.  \nRemember, this is a difficult time, but it's not the end. Whatever happens, you've gained valuable experience that you can apply to your next venture.

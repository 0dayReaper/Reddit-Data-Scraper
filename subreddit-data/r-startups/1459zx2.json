You should also have clear and well defined criteria for each stage of the customer journey (to keep track of the clients). \n\nYou should be integrating with any and all paid media, calendar applications, sheets/docs that contain information, conferencing (zoom), Pandadoc (for proposals) etc. \n\nThere are endless ways to make it more efficient for your business. \n\nLet me know which area is most important &amp; I can point you in the right direction!",

Zoho One license gets you like a billion apps that your business doesn't need and at least a dozen amazing ones it does need.\n\nYou could pretty much collapse your entire business stack into the one service. I'm just saying the time you could spend duct taping APIs, you could spend moving over to a holistic solution. \n\nI'm a Microsoft advocate by trade, but holy shit Zoho is amazing.",

    "postText": "I created a ecommerce marketplace for coffee and chocolates, but I can't seem to get any merchants onboard to sell. They all say they'll take a look at the site, but most never get back to me or say they're too buys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo far I've tried cold calling stores (and I'm never met with the store owner) or messaging existing Etsy sellers. What are some tips to attract sellers to my marketplace? No one is willing to give me 30 minutes to discuss what benefits our platform offers!",

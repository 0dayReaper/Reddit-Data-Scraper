It would need an android and apple app. What's the best way to learn and build this app and grow this idea? Any books, recommendations, courses?\n\nI'm skilled as a .NET and SQL developer but never worked with Android or iOS. Also I've never worked in product / marketing / leading a team / growing a company.",

Please read the book \"Moms test\", that's the best to get started.\n\nAnd talk to atleast 20-30 people. By then you'll start identifying a pattern in the demography of users and your exact value proposition.\n\nIt will also help you write your copy and decide the initial set of features to prioritise your road map. If done with speed, this is a 2-3 week activity.\n\nThen you can right code.\n\nThis seriously helped me with my idea for sharing critical details within the family, especially in case of unforseen situations.\nIt changed a lot from the initial idea.",

They say you shouldn't ask your mom whether your business is a good idea, because she loves you and will lie to you. This is technically true, but it misses the point. You shouldn't ask anyone if your business is a good idea. It's a bad question and everyone will lie to you at least a little . As a matter of fact, it's not their responsibility to tell you the truth. It's your responsibility to find it and it's worth doing right . Talking to customers is one of the foundational skills of both Customer Development and Lean Startup. We all know we're supposed to do it, but nobody seems willing to admit that it's easy to screw up and hard to do right. This book is going to show you how customer conversations go wrong and how you can do better.\n\n*I'm a bot, built by your friendly reddit developers at* /r/ProgrammingPals.  *You can summon me with certain* [commands](https://www.reddit.com/user/BookFinderBot/comments/13z7slk/bookfinderbot_commands/). *Or find me as a browser extension on* [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/book-finder/jajeidpjifdpppjofijoffbcndlpoedd?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social_media&amp;utm_campaign=comments). *Opt-out of replies* [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/BookFinderBot/comments/144zmjb/bookfinderbot_optout/). *If I have made a mistake, accept my apology.*",

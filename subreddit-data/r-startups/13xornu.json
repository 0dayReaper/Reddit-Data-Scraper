    "postText": "I'm looking to sell SaaS app subscriptions in Australia from another country. Has anyone here done this before? I've looked through asic.govt.au but it's a bit unclear on how to go about this. \n\nDo I have to setup/register a company in Australia? Or can my overseas company just sell there via the app/play store?\n\nAny help would be appreciated, \n\nThanks",

Free 30 day trial then charged per month/ user tiers for the company employee count.\n\nChoosing Australia as my service suits their market.\n\nThanks,",

If you pay the Apple cut, at least you can leverage them to handle taxes and remitting them to Australia without having to go through the hassle.\n\nIf you are bypassing the Apple/Google tax by forcing signups on a website for example then yeah you\u2019ll need to handle all taxes yourself.\n\nDepending on volume you expect from day 1, the Apple Small Developer Program reduces the commission to 15% and it might be worth it to quickly validate the idea. Once you make enough, hire some professionals and move to Stripe.\n\nJust my 2 cents !",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a founder of a company that\u2019s going to be acquired in a few months. Acquirer is offering a cash lump sum or the individuals can keep entirely of their equity in new business (would just be a cap table adjustment). Today, for simplistic purposes, the company is two equal owners. Anyone have a best practice on how much to take as cash vs equity (percentage). Personally, believe the acquirer can scale company to 20x revenue based on previous demonstrations. Just looking for percent advice or if founders typically just take the money and move on. Thanks",

Makes a pretty big difference because a seat at the table to ensure future success versus just handing it off and hoping management handles it well are two different stories. If you are working for the acquirer make sure to negotiate the new compensation package before deciding how much to take out / leave in. If they know you are leaving a lot in, they don't need to be as generous with the comp package because the equity rollover is its own motivation. \n\nIf you are very confident in the management and the potential to 10-20x, I would lean toward keeping more in than not. Definitely take some off the table to diversify, but if you have no immediate cash demands and want to go for generational wealth changing outsized returns in 5-10 more years this is your shot. We are at a low in the business cycle of valuations/multiples, so even if there isn't the insane 20x growth, more modest growth but cycling into better economic/business conditions in 5+ years should let you realize a positive return all things considered.",

Ill definitely be on the hook to deliver for 18 months (irregardless of any type of pay, most likely commission based) - but offer to have a seat on the board / work full time are both there. The acquirer is \"an operator\" so I have learned his intent would be to lower operating costs but eliminating (or nearly eliminating) my salary and the other cofounders. The equity rollover is up to me. Can pull all of it in cash, although advice here seems to be take some % (60/40 below). Your advice is definitely appreciated too as I do agree that the new operator of business can achieve this type of growth in 5-10 years. My concern is the gamble aspect as the initial amount of cash wouldn't be retirement amount (\\~4.3M)",

The challenge I am having is this would be \\~4.3M, so no mater how I slice it, it's not a retirement type of thing. I am 40, so plenty of time to work more / start another thing. I do believe acquirer can achieve this plan 5-10 years (realistically, 7) of a future 100-200M exit. If those additional details help - would you still follow the 60/40 recommendation? or is 80/20 more ideal to maximize what goes into savings now?",

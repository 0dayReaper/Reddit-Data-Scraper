    "postText": "How many entrepreneurs would benefit from a course on how to maintain your energy all day long?\n(Validating it, need your answers)\n\nI am very serious on that topic, since I also struggled in the past years with lack of energy. I was consciously focusing on improving this area of my life, so I took more courses and spent a huge amount of money to learn these strategies, mindsets and exercises from the experts and implemented it.   \n\nAs I result after working 9-5 job, I have still energy to work on my new projects and businesses, working out, going out, etc and I feel so much better during the day. \n\nI am thinking about creating a course on this topic (FREE for Reddit of course).\n\nWould you guys be interested? Yes=Up, No=Down\n\nAlso let me know why you would or would not want the course. Thx! Cheers.\n\n\nUPDATE\n\n\nFirst of thanks all for the feedbacks and UPs&amp;DOWNs.\n\n\nMy intention is to give you the best tools I know and tested in this area, which can be implement and can raise your energy so you can live a more fulfilled and energized life. I will do it in a fun way so beside giving usefull information I want you to enjoy it as well. \n\nIn this course I will not discuss about suppliments (there are many different approaches, I will share some ideas, which worked for me and I will give you some resource to check if you are interested in further research, beside that I understand a lot of things can work for others which did not work for me), instead the main focus will be on more natural way of getting more energy. \n\nThe course itself will be action orineted. Meaning I do not want to share only the info, isntead I would like you to also test them and implement them into your life, since they work only if you implement it:-) So I prepare a workbook (downloadable) and action steps to implement them into your life. \n\nThe course outline is the following:\nIn a nutshell we will go through the following energy sources and how we can get more energy for them.\n\n1. Physical energy: Diet (its a contradictonary topic, there are many different approaches and I accept them, meanwhile I wanna give you the ways which works for me the best) Breathing, Exercises, etc.\n\n2. Emotional energy: Questions we ask ourselves, Gratefulness, Motivation, etc.\n\n3. Mind energy: Focus or multitasking, Goals, Relaxation, etc.\n\n4. Energy of the spirit: Purpose, Meditation, Challenge yourself, etc.\n\n5. Social energy: Mastermind group, Handling energy vampires, Sharing is caring, etc.\n\nIn each of the groups you will get exercises/tips and also I give you tools how to implement them into your daily routines. \n\nFurthermore I will differenciate between tips, which can be used on the short run as well (like an instant technique) and which can work even more on the long run. \n\nI hope that makes the course more concrete. \n\nIf you have any questions or feedbacks I warmly welcome them. Have a great day!\n\nUPDATE 22.11.2013\nThx for the feedbacks! \n\nNow I am putting together the content and the documents. \n\nMy aim is to get the course ready until next weekend (1st December, 2013)\n\nUPDATE 15.12.2013\nThe content of the course is 80% ready, but due to the fact that I was focus on my business I had no time to finalize it yet. \n\nAs soon as I finish it, I update this post and also send messages who was interested in it. \nThanks for understanding.\n\nHave a great week!\n\nUPDATE 08.08.2015\nThanks for the comments!\nThe course is finaly finished, it was a long ride :-) Right now I am finetuning the material based on one on one coaching calls (I offered a cost-free one on one coaching call to those who were interested based on the comments. I have couple of spots available for these coaching calls, so if you are interested, just pm me.).\n\nI will keep you posted on the finished course.\nCheers and have a nice weekend!",

And spending too much time in front of the computer is bad for me. Thus, I shy away from any added activities (including awesome courses) that involve computer use. \n\nP.S. If you had a course that would break me of my Reddit addiction, I'd gladly pay for that. \n",

It sounds like an infomercial.

I never have the energy to do any other hobbies, like reading or watching some walking dead or simply partying. I am a social person so I never have time to myself unless I lock myself in a room and shut my phone off. \n\nLearning how to channel my energy to be used all day would be awesome!

If there's a practical guide, I'd be all for that.\n\nI'd also wonder is it really something a course can teach? Maybe it would need an app (web or mobile) or a log book or something?",

I realized in the past years that the key issue is to implement only a few ideas and get use to it, not overwelhming yourself with everything. Meaning maybe you wanna use only 3 of the strategies, try them and then after you made a habit you introduce an other 3 tips. \n\nYeah I plan to give you spreadsheet or a routine sheet where you can follow up your progress",

    "postText": "I joined a start up company two months ago. The start up company was founded by my friend and his girlfriend. We are a total of five (3 devs, 1 business, 1 designer) in the company and we are all in college.\n\nI am thinking of resigning because I am losing interest in the work they give me. \nI initially applied for a software engineer position, and I told them that I specialize in the back-end. During the interview, they asked me it would be okay for me to explore other aspects, such as mobile app development. I said yes.\n\nWe recently joined a Hackathon, long story short, it's basically a convention where different startups create a system within two weeks and pitch it to investors. I feel bad if I would resign now and leave my friend hanging.\n\nNow, they are making me create an AI algorithm for our system, and I have trouble accomplishing the task because of my lack of expertise in that particular subject.\nI am losing interest because I find AI difficult. In addition to the decline of interest is that they don't pay me nor have they allotted any equity. I admit, it is also my fault because I did not ask those questions during the interview. I was naive because I did not prepare well as it is my first time joining a company or startup. \n\nI have not signed any documents or paperwork from the beginning. If I ever resign from the job, would it be wise if I become their shareholder? Also, how do I exit gracefully without burning bridges? I would love to hear your thoughts.",

If you think that it might turn into a successful/profitable business and you think owning equity might make you more interested, then ask for that.\n\nIf owning a piece of the company wouldn\u2019t make you interested, you should resign.",

I am losing interest because I find AI difficult. In addition to the decline of interest is that they don't pay me nor have they allotted any equity.\n\nBased on that comment right there that's 3 flags: lack of interest, lack of AI knowledge and lack of pay.\n\nQuestion 1: if you aren't interested any more after 3 months don't you think it will show in the quality of your work?\n\nQuestion 2: the lack of AI knowledge is easy to fix with personal learning but if you aren't interested in learning then why would you waste your time?\n\nAny legit startup business has to offer something to compensate you for the time and effort.  That can come through a salary or through equity; vested equity is more professional.  I learned that the hard way years ago, so do yourself a favor and read up on contracts and equity for new businesses.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you are happy so do what you think is best for yourself.  The business will succeed or fail without you being there.\n\nIt's more important to take care of #1.  That means you.\n\nEdit: You mentioned exiting out of the relationship.  Since nothing has been signed you owe nothing.  I would just write a nice letter and send it to the partners telling them something along the lines of \"hey I had a new life opportunity come up and I want to exit the relationship with you all to pursue that.  best of luck.\"  \n\nYou don't have to tell them a reason as a \"life opportunity\" can be anything.  If you still like them then keep their contact info for networking.  Clean and simple exit.",

His thoughts may be different from what you're expecting, in which case then, it's best to find this sooner.   \n\n\nIf there's a huge mismatch between what they're offering you and your expectations, then I would spend time planning your exit so that you don't burn bridges.

If you have a need for a backend engineer in the future, then we can revisit the conversation.\" Leaves the door open for a future convo if you wanted to rejoin. \n\nJust want to add though, part of being in a startup (especially as early as the one you joined) is the ability to learn quickly and be flexible, so keep that in mind as you continue to explore your options. I know it's really frustrating when you're trying to learn something you don't know, but being in a startup, this will continue to be part of your journey and it'll be beneficial to accept it's just part of the journey.

Do you think there's something interesting here, and you just don't like the part you're playing in it?\n\nReframe your \"should I quit\" question to think about the analogous reality: if you were an important part of a group project for a class together with friends, and you lost interest part way through the semester and wanted to drop the class, how would you do it without pissing off your friends? Probably you couldn't entirely, but if you told them early and agreed to help hand off the work on the project to the best of your ability, hopefully they'd get over it eventually.",

That would be a bad business decision. \nSo are you a co-founder or part of the start up team?\n\nAnd even before that I think the crux of the problem is: are you interested in solving the problem this business would like to solve? \n- if so, you wouldn\u2019t care much about the renumeration as long as you get as least a certain amount of equity (as the first \u2018hired\u2019 dev on the team I think you could expect a max a 5% - my assumption) and once the business starts making money you can get a salary. I would discuss your expectations of the amount upfront as well as the timeline you\u2019re willing to help out for \u2018free\u2019. \n- if so, learning a new tool, coding language or even completely unrelated skill would be fine: anything to help the team make the vision become reality. I get the feeling your scared of failure, and thus view the task of learning about AI as something you\u2019d rather not try. If it\u2019s that (and you will need to reflect, I won\u2019t be able to know), I\u2019d recommend reading/listening Growth by Carol Dwight. If learning AI is not what you want to do, but you do want to work in this startup, suggest how &amp;what you envision doing to add value to the team. \n- and finally if so, my next step would be: Have you outright told them you\u2019re losing interest in the work? This not only gives them an opportunity to make changes for the better and gives you experience having difficult conversations (you\u2019ll need that skill many times over later ;)\n\n- if not, if you genuinely have no interest in the problem, then no money or equity will be able to make up for the amount of hours you need to put into a start-up. \n\nI would recommend joining YCombinator (as someone else already did; they\u2019ve got great resources about having difficult conversations as well ;)\n\nGood luck!",

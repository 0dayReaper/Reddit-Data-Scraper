I currently have five solid ones made but before I go any further I\u2019d like some advice! For instance how simple should I make them? Or is more detailed better? \n\nThanks!",

Hand your friend/parent/employee/coworker your SOP and ask them to execute it and give you feedback. Revise repeat. Track how long the task(s) take to complete and include that as a rough expectation within your document.",

Remember, these will be used by employees, so they should be easy to follow. Use bullet points or numbering to break down steps, include visuals if needed, and don't forget to review and update SOPs as your business evolves! Good luck with your start-up! :)",

That way, everything is in 1 place along with HR, recruitment, IT, company policies, etc. \n\nLike someone else mentioned, clear and concise. Then execution is the most important part. I have written and implemented SOPs and made sure to work with dept management to ensure they understood, get feedback, and also get buy-in for rollouts. I also sat in on their huddles with team members while they rolled out and explained said SOPs and being there to help answer with questions team members may have - so implementation &amp; execution. Just like everything, it will change and be improved on as the business does as well - good luck!",

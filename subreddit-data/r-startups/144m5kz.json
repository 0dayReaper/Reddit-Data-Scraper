    "postText": "So there is a shopify store that did pretty decent sales (half million dollars per year) couple years ago . Its just one guy selling stuff successfully but he stopped selling for couple years now. He wants someone technical to join the \"startup\" to develop a new feature for his store and relaunch. He says he will give me equity. I am interested as the store has shown good results before and after relaunch im expecting good revenue.\r  \n\r  \nAs a tech guy, im just not sure how equity really works. Do i get to take that x percentage of profits every month? Also what is a fair amount to take here. I am the sole tech guy, managing and updating new features and the shopify store itself.\r  \n\r  \nPlease give me advice",

            "comment": "What exactly is he giving you equity in?  Equity is for a company or a product that you can sell to another company, meaning outright not just per user licensing, or sell for stock, ie ipo.  I imagine you can sell a shopify store but that doesn't sound like the end game here.\n\nSo you would then be doing a revenue share.",

                            "comment": "Well the stores main value is the revenue it generates.  My point is that in an equity share you basically get nothing until the equity is bought.  Which can happen in a few different ways.  Meaning you don't get any part of the revue itself, except maybe through a salary or a bonus.   With the idea being you are deferring that with the hope that the company will be acquired and then you get a part of the acquisition amount via your equity share.\n\nSo i would ask exactly what the equity is about.  Is the idea that the store will be sold eventually.  Or are you getting part of the actual revenue.  Revenue also is short term whereas equity is longer term.  Sometimes you can have both.  But if the store will never be sold then what is the equity for?",

Also a Shopify store isn\u2019t really a startup, unless their business is selling plugins or themes and even that is a stretch. This just sounds like a business. Startups usually (not always) have a primary business goal of being acquired or IPO. Like Shopify was a startup.Etsy was a startup. But the stores on the platforms are just that, stores.",

            "comment": "The key, in my opinion, is that, while it's not exactly the same, it can be if the parties involved reach the proper agreements.\n\nHowever, it would be better to simply make arrangements for it to be paid contract work if you do not plan on staying with the company. Due to the likelihood that the person won't want to front the development, this can be delayed and conditional (at a higher cost).\n\nSuch circumstances are typically not ideal because the person has no track record of success and may be shifting a lot of the risk to you, which typically translates to lower pay for you. These deals are frequently not great, but if you can be honest with the other party and receive adequate compensation for the risks, it might be okay.In essence, the arrangement they are looking for here means that if it fails, you get nothing. However, if it succeeds, they will receive a revenue stream for no effort or risk. For them, there is only gain; unless there are exceptional circumstances, there is no cost. Thus, the situation is not stable.\n\nThe best course of action, in my opinion, is for you to determine how much you really want paid for the project, account for risks, present that amount, and then work with the other party to come up with a compensation plan that seems to be worth roughly that much to both of you (taking risks into account in the plan). Be aware that projects like that have a propensity to grow larger than anticipated, and you should be cautious about how that affects your time and reward.\n\nNevertheless, what you are describing is a revenue share. It is different from equity - where you are simply one of the owners. It is not a given that equity will pay out, but you can try to negotiate a contract where equity behaves similarly. It is best to discuss your agreement with a lawyer.\n\nWith equity, the company will be in charge of determining how much and when to distribute to its owners. If the current owner also intends to distribute dividends to themselves, this might work, as you are entitled to a portion. They can also choose to keep all of the revenue within the company and then  you would see none of it. You may work out an agreement where payouts are guaranteed though. As a minority owner, you do have very little influence if you do not work it out ahead of time.\n\nSince startups frequently have an exit, equity is more important for them because you can then receive payment. However, it might take a long time, and it might never happen.\n\nThis is clearly not a startup, as you indicated; it is a private endeavor. An IPO is unlikely to ever occur. As long as you have a deal in place to keep the other owner to that intention and they cannot redirect revenue, it may work out for you. It will most likely be a passive income for a few years.\n\nIf you have no interest in the business, it may be better to instead get them to pay for it as contract work, with some upfront payment to demonstrate that they believe in the venture, plus a payment scheme over some period where you can demand a large portion of the revenue up to some levels to cover the total cost of the project, possibly leaving you with a permanent smaller revenue share or stake.",

Also does this store need to be registered somewhere for the agreement to hold? I mean its just a shopify store, not an LLC right?",

You are building the whole thing - they should bring something more than past experience to have a higher stake. Like if they can sink a lot of funds in it. Asking for 50 % would not be unreasonable IMO.\n\nThat is if you want to take the full risk of just being paid in equity.\n\nYou can also arrange for a split risk with part proper pay and part equity. If you believe in the business and want to stay in it, I think that is preferable to revenue share.\n\nWith equity, if you own 20 %, then you will have 20 % of the votes, you will get 20 % of the value if the company gets sold, and you will get 20 % every time the company decides to pay out to their owners. The company may choose to never pay out though and use the money to grow.\n\nI think maybe try these questions on ChatGPT as it should let you work out a lot of your questions.\n\nBefore you sign the deal, maybe ask one of your friends, a lawyer, or a community to look it over. The part that is a bit risky is that it does sound like you may need to do a lot of work before it is clear whether it will work, and it is unclear how much the other party actually believes in the opportunity.\n\nThese shoppify shopping sites, there's a lot of them.",

So see exactly what they're giving.

Maybe revenue-share is a better model were you get x% of the money from sales directly and are not prone to any profit/cost manipulations. Though that's a trickier conversation to have.",

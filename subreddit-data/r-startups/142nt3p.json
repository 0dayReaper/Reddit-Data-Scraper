    "postText": "Hi,\r  \n\r  \nunfortunately one of our co-founders has to leave the company with immediate effect and give back his equity. We already found a replacement - can we simply transfer the equity to the new person? What will the legal process look like/which documents are needed?\r  \n\r  \nThanks",

            "comment": "There\u2019s a bit more to it\n\nIf returning the shares is part of a vesting agreement then that part is straightforward. However the shares need to go back to you or to the company.\n\nOnboarding the new founder is a separate action. How complicated this is depends on where you are. If the company is worth something then you can\u2019t just transfer the shares to the new cofounder because it\u2019s then considered income as far as the tax office is concerned. \n\nYou\u2019d best find a lawyer to figure out how to do this since it can be country specific",

If you guys have all the corporate documents then everything you're asking is within the structure (in the US and Canada). Otherwise you will probably need a lawyer.\n\nIf you don't have an actual corporate structure you should probably get a lawyer, but also it doesn't really matter you just wave your hands and say \"Dave is out Jim is in, he now has equity\" and as long as Dave has no objections (and you should have him write that out) then life is fine.",

            "comment": "These are likely two different unrelated transactions, with one possible exception.\n\nStarting with the exception first: it may be possible for the replacement to purchase the equity of the original co-founder at FMV. You\u2019d likely want the LLC to have a vesting plan for the new co-founder, which may be possible to weave into the purchase documents.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s probably cleaner to break this into two transactions. \n\nIn the first, the LLC would buy back the equity of the original co-founder or cause it to be forfeited (ideally the grant paperwork or operating agreement laid this out ahead of time). This could potentially be at less than FMV.\n\nIn the second, the LLC would sell a capital or profits interest to the replacement. The capital interest would need to be at FMV (eg if the company is worth $100k, they would spend $10k to buy 10% of the company). You could give them the capital interest outright, but the problem is that they would owe taxes on the value of the interest (eg in the prior example they would have $10k of income and have to pay ~$3-5k of taxes this year). The other way would be to give them a profits interest. Let\u2019s say you want to give them about 10% of the company. You could give them a 10% profits interest above the current value or $100k. Since the company is currently worth $100k, that 10% is worth nothing at the moment of grant, so there is no taxes due initially. But if the company sells for $1M in a few years, they would get $90k (slightly less than 10% total, since they only get 10% of the $900k of growth).",

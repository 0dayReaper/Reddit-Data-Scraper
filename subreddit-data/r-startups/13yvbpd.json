But the progress is NOT GOOD. At this rate its going to take a really really long time to get anything going.\n\nHas anyone actually done this starting out as a side hustle?\n\nMy plan right now is too:\n\n* Keep working as an engineer.\n* Save enough to buy a few rental properties.\n* Quit the job,\n* Then dedicate more time to the startup.\n\nI'm open to ideas on how to make this process smoother.\n\nI know it requires significantly less time to run a rental property (contrary to what landlords want you to think).  So I wouldn't be trading as much of my time for money anymore.",

You just need to play it smart, manage time and funds very efficiently and most importantly focus on revenue generating activities earlier than you would think. \nUpskilling in sales is always my focus, get people to commit money early and you can afford to allocate more time to building.",

I have A LOT of trouble following this advice though haha.\n\nYou're MVP has to be as scaled down as much as possible to solve the problem you are working on. Ignore bikeshedding/yak shaving and just ship. Use programming libraries, frameworks and services to cobble the thing together. Don't take 6 months developing the most secure Kubernetes cluster that is provisioned on a cloud network to easily scale to serve 1 million customers. Just wrap the thing in duct tape and try and find someone who is willing to pay you.\n\nProduct market fit is key at this stage. \n\nAs for fatigue and burnout, sometimes its hard to get started. Try and break the project up into small pieces and do it little by little. \n\nUltimately, your chance of success is some function of:\n\n`Your skill X your knowledge of the domain/problem you're working on X luck\n`",

I didn't read this as combative. \n\nBasically I learn about the founder/s, idea/product, problem/solution etc.\nThen I offer up my advice as I would do as a commercial advisor on contract but at no cost. \n\nCommercial covers everything from day to day, GtM, strategy, sales, marketing, scaling, investment etc. \n\nIf I have any resources or contacts that can be of use then I will offer them up too. Generally I just try to help as much as possible and try to be as specific as possible with practical steps that need to be taken to move things forward. \n\nI also don't bs. So if something is being done wrong or an idea is bad I will tell it how it is. \n\nIt's very specific for each session. \n\nLastly, I never expect anything in return or pitch my services for the long term. All I ask for in return is a review on Trustpilot if the founder/s happy with the session. \ud83d\ude0a",

Your best bet, assuming you're in a HCOL area, is to take your salary and flip it into buying houses in LCOL areas.  If you pay a management company they take too much money, so you need a partner on site in the rental location.\n\nThat said, you still shouldn't do it.  There are approximately 5.3e6 millionaires in the united states, and you're competing against all of them if your only value is free cash flow for rental properties.\n\nThere are not 5.3e6 tech entrepreneurs capable of marketing and building a small saas.  There's a lot, but I'd be surprised if there's even a million.\n\nWork hard on leveraging your biggest differentiator.  My .02.\n\nAccelerate your progress either by downscoping your mvp, or using some of your cash to hire cheap freelancers.  (Again: a core differentiator of capable engineers is recognizing good talent.  This leans into your differentiators.)\n\nps -- it's unlikely to be able to build real estate empires for a long time.  That was, imo, a low interest rate phenomenon.  Those days are not coming back anytime soon.",

There is also a heavy dose of empathy on display too.\n\nBecause of this, aside from doing sales like you say I also really recommend public speaking. There are loads of free public speaking groups, events etc. \nIdeally speak about your idea/product but also on other topics that you know about and others you don't. Record yourself and watch it back taking note of how you speak on something you know and love Vs something you don't. A lot can be learnt here.\n\nAnother thing I recommend is reading up and learning about creative and academic writing. Do courses if you can. \nThe majority of your sales and leadership is conducted through writing. Don't listen to gurus banging on about being a good copy writer, you don't need to know how to market ideas, as a leader you need to know how to sell them. That requires creativity and intellect. \n\nLastly, deep dive into story telling. Again do courses or watch documentaries and read books. The art of storytelling tied in with the above and brings it all together. \n\nThere is also the whole matter of time management, being comfortable cold calling, sales tech stacks, understanding value propositions, sales frameworks etc. But tbh that can come later. \nFirst and foremost be an A class communicator. \n\nHope this helps \ud83d\ude0a",

Make sure it is something you know well with respect to problem space. You don't have time to iterate, do market research if you are ever going to get moving.\n2. Identify an ideal first 10 customers before you start. Call them up, tell them what you are going to be doing,and get them on the hook to take a look. Maybe you could call it market research, but I call it pre-product sales.\n3. Make the product as absolutely deminimus as possible in vision... Don't dream of a billion dollar company. Ask yourself, how can I get 1000 people to pay $8/ month or how can I get 2 enterprise deals at $50k each. If successful you can expand.\n4. If your goal is to make money build the smallest thing possible and then do the most you can to sell it. You can build an awesome product, but if you aren't selling, selling, selling then it isn't going anywhere.",

The side gig didn't earn enough to be our full time jobs for 2-3 years and we all just worked non-stop to make it happen. \n\nBootstrapping like that we had no external deadlines so it wasn't too complicated to fit the work in where we could.  In the later years I burned vacation time at my \"real\" job to attend trade shows for the side hustle.\n\nIt did a lot of damage to our personal lives.  Ruined my credit for a bit and another one of my partners lost a relationship over it.\n\nBeing totally, head-over-heels, infatuated, in love with our problem probably helped. A bit.\n\nHaving partners definitely helped, if for no other reason than we didn't have to *all* keep pedaling the *entire* time. But it was still an overwhelming pace and to be honest we kinda egged each other on too. I know I worked even harder sometimes just because I found it uncomfortable coasting when the other two were producing a lot.  This was particularly true in the early days before we discussed equity distributions.\n\nWe exited a few years ago in the 350M range.",

Invest in a REIT or find active managing partners where you can be a passive investor. Then you'll have real estate / rental and keep your time for any more involved side project. \n\nFYI, I wouldn't call it side hustle either. That's influencers and the like, not something that is likely to become a real company. Unless you're Mr. Beast.",

So far what I've been doing is dedicating 7-10am before work to my side hustle because I just really can't get the energy at the end of the day, if I do have energy at the end of the day great but if not at least I got 3 hours in in the morning.\n\nI think my performance at work only suffers a little bit, not enough to cause concern for my boss though. Only thing is I have be very particular about my prioritization at the side hustle and my main gig since my energy is much more limited now.",

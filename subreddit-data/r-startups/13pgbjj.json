    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI want to start an insure-tech company. My background is (associate) legal and I am transactional-oriented (we often handle  VC / PE investments and buy-outs at my law firm) and I have confidence with fundraising (both equity and debt). I also already have connections with some of the leading local VCs and I can use trustworthy references to get funding.\n\nI already have an idea and want to develop MVP. The problem is that I have almost 0 technical knowledge and I am not sure what I need to do next. Ideally, I would need a customised website/app because of the options that I want my platform to offer which means that template / non-coding tools are not very helpful. \n\nI see that there are two options to go forward with this:\n\n1) Gain technical knowledge. I imagine there would be a book like - Venture Deals / Mastering PE but instead of teaching you the transactional aspects of the deal, it would focus on basic technical aspects which are necessary for non-coding founders. Do you have any suggestions in that respect? \n\n2) Involve a technical co-founder. The problem is that I can\u2019t find such person and I do not have social exposure to such people. I tried approaching several people who have tried to run startups or some of our formers clients in the past but I received no responses. Do you perhaps have some ideas how to approach such persons so that my offer (of course a large equity percentage 40-60%) would make sense? I also attended several networking events but I can\u2019t really determine who\u2019s good enough and who would be sufficiently experienced to develop my idea (because I have no metrics / criteria to understand what exactly is needed due to the lack of technical knowledge).\n\nIf you have any ideas, I would very much appreciate your thoughts. Thanks!",

I found my co-founders from there.\n\nAs a technical person myself, one of the factors that decides if I would join in on an idea is your ability to pre-sell and to talk to users (legit user interview).\n\nA Figma design should be able to help you communicate your idea clearly to potential co-founders you meet.\n\nLearning technical skills to build end-to-end requires your full attention and might take a while to be able to build something actually decent.\n\nI\u2019d be happy to help out :)",

Ones charging less are gaming the system by charging you more hours than it actually took (selling same MVP to multiple clients) so it ends up costing the same.\n\nYou'd just need to hire a good developer at near-market rate and give them 30% of the company on top of the salary. If you can't fund a developer for 3 months then you need to get investments.\n\nIf you can't get 30-50k of funding then you're not doing your job as CEO. Nobody technical will join you if you can't pay them. Everyone needs a \"business person\" to do sales but if they can't do that one thing then they're useless.\n\nI've worked for startups before and I usually ask for 20% more than what I'm currently making so I end up being compensated way better than market rate. Then I ask for a chunk of equity so I have some skin in the game and motivation to go above and beyond.\n\nPlenty of idiots with \"an amazing idea\" ask me to do free work. Those idiots never get past the idea stage.",

Is it someone who can manage the development process, or are you just looking for a coder? If it's the second, hiring a freelancer might be an option.\n\nIf you do want someone to manage the process, you need to make clear what it is that you bring to the table. Technical people get a lot of offers to become part of a startup. What they don't want to hear is someone who says \"I'll bring the idea, you do the work, and we'll split 50/50.\" So you'll need to show them what your half of the work will be. It might be marketing, it might be working your industry contacts, it might be some kind of expert knowledge. But you need to sell yourself, not just your idea.",

I\u2019ll need to get pre-seed investment, How much equity do you usually give away in pre-seed ? Im the only founder at the moment as well. Or would my better option be to find a tech co-founder ?

An app that is based on ML, OCR is likely going to be complex and delicate, and require several iterations to get right. Outsource tech teams, no matter how good and reputable are incentivized to push out code in the quickest and lowest effort possible, not the highest quality code to meet your business needs. This can work for simple workflow, e-commerce, websites, or simple well scoped modules within an app to augment an existing dev team, and even then, you need a strong in-house tech leader to carefully define specs, guide the outsource team, and hold them accountable. Your app falls well outside this category. Find a strong tech founder or risk losing IP and building the wrong solution or one that doesn\u2019t work or that cannot be updated and managed.

Also u will rely on the guy cuzz he will be the only one who understands the code.

After that we formed a solid founding team that got 400k in funding. In our case It was mandatory to have a CTO that led our in-house coding team",

You need a product market fit and it is very important to validate it with potential customers. You are gonna make mistakes, it's normal but do it fast and cheap. Don't build something beautiful with many nice to have features, focus on actually delivering the main function of ur app. You can use Figma to test functions and CX, have potential clients access this workflow(you can offer an early access to ur app when it's completed). For example, before lunching a new product, we used the methodology of \"Design Sprint\", (there is a book about this and it's great), this was led by my UI/UX designer, it's always easier to start first by design ( not by tech/product), then she worked in the design and the workflow of the app and then sent us a figma link that help us test as users the app. After some validations we send it to the IT \u00e1rea to work on it.",

But if you've been through such a program before, its value diminishes and you can raise a pre-seed round from VCs/angels where you can get $500k-700k for 8-10% equtiy dilution.\n\nI'll recommend against the $200k and getting the product done by a third party, because it is your core offering. Which should be understood well by an in-house developers. Its first of all a lot of money and product development should always happen in iterations by getting feedback from users.",

My advice is to work really hard to find a trusted technical advisor before engaging with anyone else including a technical co-founder. Be prepared to give them a small but still significant piece of equity and/or an hourly fee. Define the scope of their contribution to be focused on helping you guide high-level tech architecture and vet technical partners for the project and serve as a second set of eyes on any proposals, and they should also regularly check-in on the ongoing development work.  Setting all that aside, I'm curious what steps you've taken to validate your idea so far that makes you think you are ready to raise and build an MVP this costly?",

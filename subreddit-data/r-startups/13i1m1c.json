    "postText": "I thought that this sub might be the appropriate sub to ask this question because I know we have a community who are working hard, not normally. \n\nSo,\n\n\u0131 and my other two founders closed a pre-seed round. We hired employees and working on our startup for 16 months. My other two founders focused on the development part and I am focusing on the business side, project roadmap, customer help, company paper works, and sometimes the development side.   \nAlso, I am trying to sell the product, talking with potential customers daily, organizing meetings, and running automated campaigns with my LinkedIn account. (My bach degree is in software engineering)\n\n^((PS: Don't blame my founders for just getting the responsibility of the tech side))\n\nRight now, we just started to generate revenue and our money will be finished in 1-2 months according to the predictions. 3 months ago, I was waking up happy, and excited but nowadays, I don't even want to wake up. Every time, I just want to forget everything and don't blame myself. For example, if I make breakfast for more than 10 min, I m starting to think that I need to work and don't waste time.  \n\n\n* Always thinking to take a vacation for 5 days without talking to anyone, checking the phone, and worrying about the startup. I need to be online 24/7 because we have clients in China and US. Someone needs to be up and that is me. I can't take off day\n\nSince last week, I don't even want to talk to clients who have responded to me positively because I don't believe that will save us or not... \n\nThe questions are:\n\nAm I burning out?\n\nWhat should I do?\n\n^(Ps: we have more than 200 users from different countries but our revenue is too low. People are interested in our product but it is to hard make them paying customers.)",

Hard to backtrack on it, but if I were you I would stop up, tell the management team things need to change immediately and it may already be too late. Hardest part may be to acknowledge the truth to yourself. Think a few months ahead, assume all fall apart, what actions should you have done today to bring you to a better future? Let people go? Scale down in activities? Focus on a particular aspect of your business more than others while you can? Only you have the big picture",

You wrote the problem that you have in a smaller font in a PS to your post, I think you focus too much on your anxiety and should focus more on the problem you are facing. \n\nIt's ok bo anxious, and it's ok to fuck up or be clueless, but if you have co-founders or employees you are responsible not only to yourself but also to them, and you need to face the scary truth that you are fucked right now and you need to work hard on how to tackle this. \n\nIt's the fear that's consuming you, and it's your responsibility to take care of yourself, and to your partners and employees to do the maximum that you can (that's probably what you expect from them), to find a new way, because the scary part is that what you believed in is yesterday, your bet that you made, today it was verified and you lost. You need to come up with a new bet that will give you and your team better life, and that you will fully be able to commit to it, or you soon scary part won't be facing your failure, but facing your downfall when reality check will come.\n\nYou don't want to be the guy that when he knew he lost his bet, didn't commit to a new way, and was honest to himself and his team, but drove your whole pack into the wall, seeing it from a distance.",

And you are right, just fearing and doing nothing is not helping me.

But the joy of figuring stuff out and getting to cheerful calmness is always ahead of us, so we need to be brave and not let ourselves freeze. It's either fight or flight, freeze is depression.",

(own experience)\n\nSo days off only make sense if you can organize a substitute you can trust. Otherwise you can't relax. \n\nSince you currently have zero relaxation, maybe a few hours would already help to alleviate the stress. A second cell phone to be reachable in case of emergency. An inexpensive person, trained only to recognize \"catastrophes\" on the phone and to call you in case of emergency. Nobody else knows the number. So you can switch off for hours. It's not much, but it's better than nothing. That's how we started back then.\n\nAnd burnout? It usually starts with vegetative problems. Increased heartbeat, dizziness, palpitations, sleep problems, nausea, etc. When something like that appears, it becomes critical.",

And from reading your post, it seems like - as someone else here already suggested - anxiety (fear of failure) may be a factor in this for you too. \n\nMy advise would be to find someone to talk with, a coach or mentor, who can help you navigate the next couple of months in a more sustainable way. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend jumping ship now, because that may have a bigger negative effect on your mental state in the long term than giving it your best shot now would have.",

That took time.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t even remember when I took off. I remember that 1.5 years ago, I was in a tent(couple of days vacation) and was checking my emails if there is a problem with clients or not.\n\nAnd thank you for the comment.

It will help you to find what drives you and plan your life around it. Ditch less important things, focus on what matters the most.\n\nThen do some managed solitude. Sit down for an hour, no mobile phone, no distractions and let your mind think about your problem(s). Do it daily if neccessary.\n\nIt might not fix the burn out, but it might show you the way.

Best advice from a founder is to take a well deserved vacation for a week or 2. Come back with a fresh set of eyes and mind towards the project. Don\u2019t answer emails while on vacation either. Have a vacation notice on your email. Arrange this with your founders. If they support you they will understand.",

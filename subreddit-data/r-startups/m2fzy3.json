    "postText": "I made this new reddit account to post this anonymously and I will leave out identifying details, but I want to share a story about what has happened to me, and I want to start a discussion around this, get advice, hear other stories. \n\nI am the founder of a pre revenue post product startup that is raising its seed round. We have been pitching VCs for a few months, and we recently gained traction, but it was hard going for a while. \n\nWe pitched this one VC, that is a prominent albeit not tier 1 VC. Sent a cold email, got a email with questions, then was asked to make a video pitch, then got an actual meeting with a partner, only to be told a week later that the market was too broad and they did not want to move forward. No biggie. \n\nBut one of their portfolio companies is an indirect competitor, and has already raised a few million a couple years ago but hasn\u2019t really reached PMF or any kind of break out success. I was browsing linkedin one week after I was rejected by this VC to see a post about a new product by this company. To my utter shock, they had opened up a waitlist to beta test a product that was literally exactly what I pitched this VC. Even had multiple lines stolen right out of my deck. I am in utter disbelief and shock at the depravity of such an unethical move. One day, I will share the names, but that will not be today. \n\nNeedless to say, they don\u2019t know everything we know, they nor do they have the technical progress we have, and our entire company is dedicated to this whereas this is just another product by them. I am not overly worried, but still, its not pleasant. We are moving forward regardless and will just have to work 3 times as hard. \n\nThoughts, advice?",

I\u2019m not so naive as to believe that the sort of behavior the OP experienced never happens., But when it\u2019s a blatant as the OPs experience, they literally used language from the pitch in the beta marketing, that has to be called.

It could make them your hostage on long-term. (rethink how to build a mutual constructive relationship). \n- The project will perform better when fully integrated on their environment.

Any reasonable VC is meeting with a ton of companies in the same space and would be scared off of engaging with you in case something similar but unintentional happens and they get accused of brainrape. \n\nIn an ideal world people who do this would get blasted publicly, but what\u2019s good for the community is not always good for the founder. We had a horrible VC in our seed round who threatened to blow up an acquisition if he didn\u2019t get far more than what he was due. I would love to publicly shame him and his behavior by telling our story, but there just isn\u2019t an upside for me to do that.\n\nWhat you might consider is posting a well documented version of the story with the names removed on Twitter/Medium. That way you might at least get some VC/Tech Community attention for your company out of it. If you appear to still be protecting the VC\u2019s identity, you might be able to avoid scaring VC\u2019s off and get some attention from the ones who would be interested in helping.\n\nThe lowest risk route though, is to just do nothing.",

I know they may be able to block an acquisition, but what was he looking for? Did you have other VCs in the seed round? Weren't they pissed about it? This has to be the kind of behavior that gets known pretty quickly.  Can you share what you ended up doing?",

LateCo even used a lot of the same marketing language that EarlyCo used on their website. \n\nI never shared EarlyCo's deck with LateCo. I *did* call LateCo while doing diligence on EarlyCo to ask them about the market and ecosystem. I asked EarlyCo's permission to do this. I pointed LateCo at EarlyCo's website but did not share any non-public information. \n\nEarlyCo was furious. Accused me of sharing their materials. When I assured them I hadn't they suggested my partner on LateCo's BOD had pulled their deck out of our CRM and sent it to them. I can't be 100% sure he didn't, but he said he didn't and believe him. EarlyCo stopped inviting me to BOD meetings (I have the right to be there, but am not exactly going to send lawyers after them for a calendar invite). Now EarlyCo is running out of money and asking if I'll participate in a bridge. Obviously not, after that behavior. \n\nIn the end, I don't see anything that LateCo did that they couldn't have learned from EarlyCo's website. We're minority investors, not owner-operators.",

Apparently VCs have decided the pandemic and remote pitches give them even more opportunity to be unethical assholes. Granted this use to happen before the lockdowns, but it\u2019s definitely accelerated in recent months.\n\nUltimately this is kind of your fault, hear me out.\n\nWhy are these features in your deck? \n\nWhy are you giving away your secret sauce?\n\nWay too many founders build pitch decks wrong. They focus entirely on what the product is, and how it works. Do NOT do this.\n\nA pitch deck only needs to really answer the question of \u201cwhy now?\u201d and \u201cwhy should I trust you to solve this problem?\u201d\n\nThe purpose of the pitch deck is to tell and sell a story. It is not to show amazing new features, give away your business model, reveal key research or insight into the market, or anything like that.\n\nThe purpose of a deck is to sell your vision and mission, state a problem, state why you\u2019re the person to solve that problem, what the opportunity is, and why you need money to do it. That\u2019s it.\n\nNotice how none of these things include what your product looks like? What the features are? What your business model or marketing position is?\n\nDon\u2019t give away your secret sauce. If they want to know more they can sign an NDA and book a second meeting.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested I would be happy to sign an NDA, actually honor it, and review your deck for you and tell you what you need to fix. I usually charge for this but it pisses me off when VCs take advantage of startups like this so I\u2019ll do a basic review and provide my feedback for free if you want.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you, but please learn from it. This an opportunity to learn how to be a better storyteller, play your cards closer to your chest, and as others have said this is actually market validation.\n\nYour deck is to sell the dream, or promise land, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s emotional. It\u2019s a story. It\u2019s not about what/how. It\u2019s about why.",

Say each innovation you've made (be they big or small) can be replicated to around 80% similarity. If you have 5 innovations then .8\\*.8\\*.8\\*.8\\*.8 = \\~32% which means they have only a 32% chance of pulling off what you've done and the wisdom you've gained. \n\nIn addition, he talks about how it's so much harder to change someone's opinion than it is to introduce them to something new. Think anti-vaxxers here - impossible to change their mind, but easy to introduce to a new health craze. If you've created an innovation, then your customers will be harder to steal then they think.\n\nI do wish you the best, it must be a gut wrenching feeling; but know that you created this due to a want in YOUR life - they can't replicate that inspiration and as a result won't be able to give the product the design care and innovation that you can.",

If that is near impossible given the business, put this venture on hold until you have enough reach and influence through other successes to open those doors.",

Provisional patents can be jimmied up quickly, which gives you a year to get a real patent, but in the meantime, you would have a case against them, especially if they're using the same sales language and all.\n\nI'm not a lawyer, though, so I would absolutely consult with one who deals in these matters to see if it's a viable option.  Also, talk to your core team and see what they want to do.  Simply moving on is probably the less hectic route, but it could prove fatal if they end up doing a really great job.  If so, then you're basically tasked with figuring out how to differentiate yourself in a way that makes you ten times better than them.\n\nBut yeah, it really just depends on what your product is and how well you think your competitor will do.  Like, if this is a service that tons of other startups are already doing and the edge you bring is significant enough to get you into the game, but not significant enough to truly differentiate you, then it's not worth the hassle of suing.  But, if this aspect of your product or if the product itself is so revolutionary that it will spark a paradigm shift in the market and if there is literally no one else doing it?  Eh, idk.  Might be worth it then.\n\nHowever, first to market isn't always the big winner.  It's all about how your product or service is ten times better than the rest.  I guess I would just ask myself this question.  Can I iterate this product from the start so that it is ten times better than everyone else in spite of the fact that my competitor stole my idea?  If you can't or you see it as being a monumental uphill battle, you may really want to consider the more aggressive route.  But, if you feel you can adapt and outcompete, then definitely don't sue!\n\nAlso, you gotta ask yourself how truly passionate are you about the goal of the service?  Like, we all wanna be successful and make money, but is that more important to you than the actual problem you want to solve?  There's no problem in wanting to just be successful and make money, but if that is the case, then it should be far easier to walk away from this if it ends up failing, in which case it's not worth getting into a lawsuit over.",

I was recently introduced to a VC firm that is made of coders and also smart business people who have access to over 60 coders.  I spoke with the founder on the phone for like 15 minutes and he asked me to send him everything I have.  Realizing that all I reallly have are ideas that haven't been test but I feel strongly about and knowing he has the resources to make it happen, did I make a big mistake like this guy?  Or perhaps he didn't make a mistake.  I've been spinnng my wheels with people who claim to be coders but know I would get much further working with professionals with experience.  Anyway, appreciate any thoughts echoing off the original post about how a founder can protect themselve as I know it would probably be an insult and would ensure 0 interest if asking a VC to sign an NDA.  It seems like VC have so many people presenting ideas to them that this probably doesn't happen too often?  Am I wrong and what can founders do to be protect themself?  Am I overthinking the effects of even asking them to sign an NDA?",

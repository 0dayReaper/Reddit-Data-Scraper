There's an opportunity to add new services for the same type of clientele/prospects - although they are related, it'd be confusing for new leads who are being pitched with this domain name for these new services. How would you handle this?\n\nThank you very much!",

I'd rather have marketing that is perfect for target customer than try to fit it in to existing stuff if there is little overlap.\n\nLet's say you have `windowwashing.com` and are now adding [`roofpainting.com`](https://roofpainting.com) as a new service. Keeping them separate would be better. Most customers choosing one probably aren't looking for the other. However, you can still have links on each site that point the other site in case someone is looking for both. `roofpainting.windowwashing.com` would be silly.",

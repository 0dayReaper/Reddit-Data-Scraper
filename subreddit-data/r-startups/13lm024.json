Especially if you are in B2B it's really crucial to build your own brand as a person, as a CEO, that creditability will drive organic growth. Yeah and of course keep being active and helpful in different community forums. all the best",

            "comment": "First tip: be clear on product-market fit, ICP, positioning, messaging. Those things are essential for highly resonating content. They literally dictate what content you should create and where/how to distribute it. Otherwise, it will be slow and expensive, I doubt you have too much wiggle room as a bootstrapped startup...  \nSecond tip: try an agile approach. Audit current content to see what's worked before. Create a \"lite\" version of a content marketing strategy that you can test, expand, and optimize as you go. Note down what channels you can sustainably manage with the budget and time you have (a blog, some social media channels). What sort of customers are your best fit (so you can create laser-focused content)? What do existing customers say are your company's or product's strongest points (so you can market that expertise and value to new leads)?  \nHappy to give more specific pointers from a content marketer's perspective if you want to share some more details.",

I knew I had to create great content, but how?\r  \n\n\nWell, here's the thing, every target audience is different, but they all love value. Give them something that either solves their problems or makes their life easier. For me, I found creating how-to videos and guides really worked.\r  \n\n\nAnd don't forget about social media. Instagram is where it's at. It's like the world's largest shopping mall, and you wanna be in it. I used Ascendviral to grow my account, and it did wonders for my engagement.\r  \n\n\nSo, dive in, learn as you go, and don't be afraid to experiment.",

For content marketing, try focusing on writing in-depth blog articles that solve problems or answer questions your target audience has.

Where you\u2019re ideal customer typically \u201changs out\u201d (e.g. which social platforms do they use, do they listen to podcasts, which key influencers do they follow, which events do they attend etc).\n\n2. What type of content your ideal customers likes to consume (long form, short form, video, written etc). \n\n3. What do they actually want to know or learn about, in context of the problem you solve (this drives the topic of the content you create)\n\nSparkTorro is great at finding some of this stuff out for you but nothing beats real life research interviews with your actual ideal customers. \n\nAnd on that note, your sales and marketing plan should be entirely led by your customer - not what random people tell you on Reddit.",

            "comment": "Absolutely, content marketing can be a powerful tool for startups looking to establish credibility and generate leads. Here's some advice to get you started:  \nUnderstand Your Audience: This is crucial. What are their needs and pain points? What questions are they asking? Tailoring your content to address these aspects can make it more engaging and relevant.  \nValue Over Promotion: Effective content marketing provides value to the audience. This could be in the form of advice, insights, or entertaining stories. Avoid making your content overly promotional - people are more likely to engage with content that helps them rather than just sells to them.  \nDiversify Your Content: Try different forms of content such as blog posts, case studies, infographics, videos, webinars, etc. This can cater to different audience preferences and give you more chances to attract and engage people.  \nLeverage SEO: Identify keywords relevant to your business and incorporate them in your content. This can help improve your search engine rankings and increase the visibility of your content.  \nConsistency is Key: Regularly publish content to keep your audience engaged and improve SEO.  \nPromote Your Content: Use social media, email newsletters, and other channels to promote your content. Engaging with your audience on these platforms can further boost visibility.  \nFor further learning and real-world case studies, check out the [Open Source CEO newsletter](https://open-source-ceo.beehiiv.com/). They interview successful founders and share their best practices, which can provide you with valuable insights.  \nAlso, consider using tools like [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) or [Moz](https://moz.com/), which offer free resources on content marketing and SEO. They also offer tools that can help automate and optimize your content marketing efforts.  \nRemember, content marketing is a marathon, not a sprint. It may take time to see results, but consistent effort and quality content will pay off. Good luck!",

The one you believe your market is spending the most time on and spend time consistently posting quality content (with the goal of becoming a thought-leader in your space) about your niche. Next, make sure you are engaging daily with others in your space and starting conversations. This will drive more users to your page and allow them to stumble upon your product as well. \n\nThen, as you grow and more users are engaging with your content, you will be able to see what forms of content perform the best and can double-down.",

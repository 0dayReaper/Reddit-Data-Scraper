I've seen testgorilla, hackerrank, codesignal, and codility, and some of them won't even display their price and ask you to contact them instead. I usually prefer not to have to deal with salespeople when buying a saas product.\n\nI just want a reliable tool to test my next website developer. That's it",

I have zero tech skills and still don't know how to code.\n\nSome things you can do is to look on the WordPress repo for popular plugins but not *too* popular. Something like 1000-5000 active installs. Check out their reviews, if the reviews are good and they are timely with communication in support topics, then reach out to them. Tell them how you found them and that you'd like to hire them for a small project if they are open to it. Chances are they will do it because while 1000-5000 active installs is a lot, you're not going to be making a full-time living on it.\n\nMany won't reply, but some will. Give them a test project to see how it goes. Do a lot of end user testing (since that's what you can do). \n\nI hired some devs this way who stayed with the company for years.\n\nAside from this method, you need to build a network. Get on Twitter, go to WordCamps, etc. so you can start meeting people who **are** developers, or who **know** developers. \n\nFinal note: devs don't want to do anything for free. Pay them, and pay them in a timely manner.\n\nGood luck!",

They require a lot of experience in software development so that you can interpret the results and even if you have that they provide a less then reliable result. \n\nWhat these tools test is deep theory in computer science and math. They don\u2019t even test if you are a good developer. They just test if you had the time to study hackerrank specifically. None of this theory would be even be necessary for a \u201cwebsite Developer\u201d.\n\nYou are much better of just reading the CV and talking to the candidates.\n\nSource: 10+ years as software developer and 5+ years involved with hiring.",

Unless you're going to essentially fork Wordpress or develop something like WooCommerce that's huge and deeply integrated into Wordpress it really doesn't matter who you get... my guess is that every PHP developer knows Wordpress but even moreso Wordpress is quick to pick up and the documentation for it is great. You don't need some guy with a CS degree to do your Wordpress development. If a person says \"I know wordpress\" they likley do. If you talk to them and you trust them and you get a good vibe from them then they also are less likely to be taking you for a ride.",

The questions I usually ask them are:\n\n-What themes do you usually use? (Usually themes like Hello Elementor and Astra are good bets and show experience) \n\n-Do you work with a builder? (Elementor Pro, WP Bakery and Divi are good answers)\n\n-How do you assess the usability of a website? (if they have accessibility to people with disabilities in mind, that's a plus. Otherwise, since you have no experience, be wary of people who don't seem to have a straight answer) \n\n-Are you comfortable with WordPress optimization? (if they say they are comfortable both on the website and server side, they're a good bet)\n\n-Are you used to make SEO and security audits? (if so, ask them if you can know their approach to the audits. Some use tools, which is usually more comprehensive and less time consuming, which also means the work will be done faster and cheaper)\n\n-Are you comfortable with applying security optimization? (if so, being able to do ALL the optimizations both server side and on the website is a plus)\n\n-Can you work with cPanel? (this will depend on your hosting plan but it's not unusual for the configuration to be in cPanel. Anyway, it's a good measurement for experience)\n\n-Are you experienced with redirects, DNS and migrations? (This is mandatory)\n\nHope this helps!",

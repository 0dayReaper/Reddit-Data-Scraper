We don't have the leverage of an HR department like bigger companies. \n\nFor those who hired frontend developers successfully, what guided your choice? \n\n\\- Did you ask them for a technical interview? if so what platform did you use?\n\n\\- Did you ask them to solve a problem or build a part of your company's portfolio?\n\n\\- Any specific interview redflags to look for?",

If you can't find anyone, reach out to investors you have a close relationship with and see if they have anyone in mind. I know this would be controversial, but the best employee on my team was found this way. He was a cousin of someone I worked with.\n\nYou could also try LinkedIn and its recruitment app. It allows you to filter candidates easily.\n\nI know this is obvious advice, but I would encourage you to spend the time to scope out the duties, tech stack, and profile of what you are looking for.",

My background previously was the fire service.\n\nI see devs as firefighters. Their character  and values is more important than their skills. Why..because if they truly believe in what you are building they can be mentored and they will seek out opportunities to learn.",

Personally its less about technical skills and more about communications.  Unless you have a very specific task you need done.  Alot of developers have poor communication skills and that can be problematic.\n\nAlso I like to know that they have worked on or are familiar with multiple languages as they demonstrates engineering skills as opposed to if they just have worked with one technology as this can be done in more of a copy and paste way.  \n\nRed flags.  If they have poor communications skills.  Also if you ask them a few basic technical questions and they don't know the answer.  For example what is git.  Or for react, what is redux.  This would demonstrate a junior level person.",

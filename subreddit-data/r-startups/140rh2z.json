The product is completely ready, I would say it's something more than an MVP. The problem is that I'm more of a technical mindset. I'm thinking about hiring someone to handle it or finding a co-founder. That in the first and second case I'm worried about money, as I have a limited budget. Any advice on this? Perhaps you have a similar story?",

Don't be so quick to give a huge percentage away to a co-founder unless you really really know that person can be a force for growth, or they can do a whole bunch of stuff you don't know / don't want to know.",

Some guy who used to be a former large steel company executive will likely deliver very little value. They could have helped your company (huge conflict of interest) back when they had power. But at this point people probably won't take their calls. This sort of person is good to talk to and pick their brains, but not worth equity. I have seen many a person like this weasel their way into a position like \"board advisor\" and delivery exactly zero. The reason they are often no longer an executive is they were pushed out by people who then burned their entire network to the ground.",

            "comment": "Hey there!\n\nThere a few different options. I\u2019ve found cofounders through Wellfound (formally known as Angel List) and that worked out well. You could also try hiring a Chief Revenue Officer or a Chief Growth Officer and giving them less. One thing is stress heavily is that it\u2019s probably in your interest to find someone who\u2019s been in this industry and maybe sold to these companies before.\n\nI\u2019d disagree slightly with others here and say a cofounder would hugely helpful. They don\u2019t have to be equal in terms of equity but having someone invested in the product long term would be valuable and the title cofounder can go a long way.\n\nThere may be people in my network who are interested depending on what industry. \n\nI\u2019d be happy to talk in DMs to see if I can help further as I\u2019ve been through this ringer before.",

That said, a co-founder hire is beyond critical and trajectory changing. \n\nHave you considered other options? Why do they need to be a co-founder? What sort of gaps do you have? I am a coach with a 15 year product management background. I also serve as a fractional product leader in select roles.

Building first and hoping for demand later is a mistake many technical founders make. The fact that you may have built something more than an MVP without talking to customers is not a positive thing. \n\nSales is really important and difficult. Even if it's not something that makes you uncomfortable, get ready to do some selling. In fact, your first sales job will be convincing a cofounder to join you. That being said, you should be incredibly picky about your cofounder. If all goes well, this partnership could last longer than the average marriage.  \n\n\nGood luck!",

    "postText": "So i'm doing my third interview in office at a tech startup. Not gonna give too much details but I just wanted to know if anyone has any tips?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe position is basically someone who has to oversee tech support workers in L1 and help implement a new system (which I have corporate experience in), but I have no managerial experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow can I best show that I myself, am up for the task? I've already received maybe 25-30+ questions, behavioural, and textbook questions as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot sure what else they can ask me during the in office interview. Assuming it'd be a panel interview, and then maybe one more interview with C-level..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny tips?",

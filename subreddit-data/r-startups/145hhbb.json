For context: I spent around 20 dollars on ads, got 10 signups, and CTR of 2%. So my question is, how much signups would you think is enough to validate the idea, given the cost of ads?",

Average transaction size/volume  3. Frequency of usage by customers. Bottom line - If it\u2019s a commodity problem and high volume game I would prefer having 100s of sign ups to validate",

Without a plan, which is what your state is, your success or failure (more likely case) is all based on your luck. \n\nBasically, you need to answer these questions: how will I reach to 1000/5k/10k/100k users, etc? How will I monetize? Can I get funding or can I earn money from users, etc? And a bunch of other questions.\n\nWatch videos about it. Read some articles from credible people/institutions (e.g. ycombinator), ask questions in chatgpt, etc. \n\nEducate yourself which is most engineers with great ideas fail to do.",

You got a decent amount of users signing up to your ad test. It\u2019s ok, but not mind blowing. I think you should proceed. This doesn\u2019t mean to fully build an MVP, but you might start to reach out to those users, ask them a couple of questions or even do a proper user interview (based on their availability, you\u2019ll also get a senso of how interested they are in your product).\n\nYour never 100% certainty of the validity of a product out of a single experiment, but more a series of signals that increase your confidence towards a certain direction and allow you to take decisions about your product.",

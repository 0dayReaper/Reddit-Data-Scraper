    "postText": "Hi all,\r  \n\r  \nI am one of the developers of an open source app, geared towards developers. We are very new to trying to gain followers\\\\users for our app. I'm looking for any advice on how to reach out to bloggers or youtubers, or if you have any other suggestions on how to try and gain some traction.\r  \n\r  \nBrief recap of what we have done so far\r  \n\r  \nPosts on reddit\r  \n\r  \nPosts on our socials\r  \n\r  \nFinding blogs, try to send emails or though their \u201ccontact us\u201d section\r  \n\r  \nFinding YouTube channels and contacting them\r  \n\r  \nReach out to people on linked-in\r  \n\r  \nSo far we have been getting traction mainly from reddit, we are trying to get people that have an audience already to notice us. I know I'm a little biased, but we have a good product, that is free, and we are just looking to get it into the hands of developers like us. Currently we haven't gotten any email responses from bloggers or youtubers.\r  \n\r  \nAny advice?",

            "comment": "Your project is focused on spring boot?  That has a somewhat niche audience.  So that will take time.  Even though spring is the most widely used framework in java kotlin land, its still small compared to other languages.  So that is somewhat difficult.  Also you are dealing with a community that is somewhat stuck in their ways.  Also it's not entirely clear what problem your product solves frankly.\n\nI would say keep doing what you are doing.  It will be a slow growth though probably.  As a sidenote there is a podcast about spring boot.  You can try that as well.",

I would say maybe post on twitter or somewhere.  Somewhere you can do it regularly.  Also try meetups.\n\nSo what did you use to build the app?",

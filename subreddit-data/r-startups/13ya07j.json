    "postText": "Hey founders,\n\nI'm digging a lot into SaaS pricing lately and I realized something ridiculous...\n\nStartups change their product &amp; marketing strategy **every month**.\n\nYet most companies (big &amp; small) adjust their pricing **once every 3 years**.\n\nThen when you cut the bull---- you realize that's the main reason why startups fail:\n\n* They're bootstrapping and can't get enough revenue to get funded\n* They're funded and still run out of money\n\nWhy? Because they don't find the right pricing &amp; monetization strategy.\n\nWhy? Because they set a price and never think about pricing again.\n\nWhy? Because they lack pricing expertise and leave it for last. Until it's too late.\n\nTrue, pricing is its own art &amp; science and not everyone is an expert. Even if you're lucky enough to have a pricing expert on your startup team, they still need time, data, and experimentation to find the right pricing strategy.\n\nI think now is the most important time to think about pricing because:\n\n* The economic downturn and market shifts are making companies shrink their budgets\n* Mass layoffs, no-code, and AI enable more people to launch new products tonight\n* The right monetization unlocks sustainable growth, attracts the right buyers, and helps you build the product around the pricing strategy so you scale profitably.\n\nYou've probably heard this quote:\n\n\"1% improvement in monetization unlocks over 12% in profitability.\"\n\nStill, even if you choose to focus on pricing, how do you do it? Where do you start?\n\nHaving the data is one thing, but it's definitely not enough.\n\nI believe the truth lies on your pricing page. It's the 2nd most visited page on your SaaS website and it's the place where the buying decision happens.\n\nTrouble is that building pricing pages that sell isn't the easiest thing. You still need to know a lot about pricing to do it right.\n\nWell, the best way to learn is by doing.\n\nI believe an easier way to build and iterate beautiful pricing pages is a great first step to making founders and startup teams think more about their pricing and be proactive in finding the right pricing strategy.\n\nHaving an easy way to test out different monetization models such as feature-based pricing vs usage-based pricing is the best way to figure out what works.\n\nSo my question to you guys is this:\n\nWould you use a product that helps you build pricing pages faster, test multiple pricing strategies faster, and start driving more revenue earlier in your startup journey?\n\nI'm working on an [MVP](https://pricer.framer.website) for this right now and I'm validating the idea at the same time. Would love to hear your thoughts!",

The startup target is because the product is actually meant to help them get profitable since pricing is the only way to get there. It will be priced accordingly for them so they can grow faster and get to the next stage. Turning startups into growing companies will be a key part of the company mission. :)",

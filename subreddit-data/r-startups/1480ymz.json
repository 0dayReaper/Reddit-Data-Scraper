However, I'm unsure about where I can find tech startups to email. What are some good resources to look into?",

While I have a strong foundation in coding and data analysis, I am open to exploring various roles and industries related to tech to broaden my skill set. \n\nI think that gaining different experiences will give me a broader perspective and help me expand my knowledge in different areas. Though I don't have much experience related to product management, I find the consumer focus and higher-level outlook interesting.  I want to continue improving and growing this summer while making a positive impact in whichever path I pursue.",

Feel free to be creative with this, maybe compensation is free access to the company's products if they have a worthwhile product you need/want. \n\nI'm the founder of a tech start up ([farloe.io](https://farloe.io)) and I've found that it's really time consuming to bring on support that isn't self-directed and self-motivated. Show that you are a self-starter with the ability to get things done and everyone will want to have you on their team.\n\nOnce you've identified what you can do for them, start cold e-mailing or create an introduction video using Loom. \n\nEmails are super easy to find these days - go to Crunchbase and see what companies have received funding recently. Look up their founder's name and email them directly! Someone will bite.",

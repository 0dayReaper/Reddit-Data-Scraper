    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI work at a startup Saas company and recently had a conversation with a client who is planning to launch a new startup. He is trying to launch a project, that I had exact same idea couple of years ago. So I shared my thoughts on that and he was interested in them. Subtly he offered to work together in this new project. \n\nAfter giving a thought, I am inclining to discuss details in the next call to better understand. \n\nHe held senior roles in the big organizations in the past, and planning to invest his own money. \nI recently finished my masters degree in business and have experience in working in one of the crucial topics for this project. \n\nThe startup is still in the idea phase and he needs lots of help from product, tech and running a startup point. That's where I can help a lot and join as co-founder. \n\nMy question is: \n1. How much equity should I ask and for how much I should settle ? \n2. Given I just entered to workforce, I would need a salary as well to be able to maintain myself. So should I ask for it ? \n\n\nSorry for long text!",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nSo, I got hired as the third employee in a startup and worked there for five years. I led a team to build many of the core offerings, my team developed most of the startup IPs. I was always told by the founder that I would be rewarded when they make an exit (nothing in writing). When they made an exit of $80M+ I was never rewarded. The founder changed their mind and told me you were getting full salary anyway. The founders never awarded any employee.  \nI feel extremely disappointed, what can I do to pursue this? Is it all over for me? Can someone legally do that?",

Also as mentioned before, if you are going to give your life to something for five years in the hopes of a windfall, at least get it in writing somewhere.  80M isn\u2019t a huge exit but it would be nice to have some extra dollars in your pocket after that dedication.",

Given the potential payout in a win, a laywer should be curious to investigate your specific case.   \n\n\nAlways get it in writing. One company I worked for gave me a job offer that looked something like this:- salary details- on equity there was 1-2 impressive sounding paragraphs that could be summarised with: 'you will be **considered** for **some** shares in the future', but obfuscated in lawyer speak\n\nIt sounded impressive, but legally speaking it was a big bag of nothingness and just an empty promise with zero specifics.\n\nI countered with requiring a guarantee that I'd be included in the equity plan, with a specific amount of shares, as well as having a cliff that starts on day 0 (So that first shares are vested after 12 months of service). My counter was accepted.",

Much like at a restaurant, you sit, order and pay before you leave. You don\u2019t get to walk out saying oh, we didn\u2019t have a written contract so it\u2019s null and void. It\u2019s implied. I had a company. Although I never made the offer of stick to this programmer we hired, one of my co-founders did. When we were being acquired he sued. We had to pay him out $35k to end the suit. It was an oral mention, no written agreement. We did have a written agreement that it was a work for hire and no ownership of stock or anything was granted. But a slip of the tongue by an overeager partner changed everything. It was fine and I felt badly, but we paid. So here, you need to not speak to anyone about this especially not the company and just talk to an attorney. Fast. Especially if the sale is still pending. The suit will need to be disclosed as a liability to the new owners. They will settle quickly to let it go through. This is when you have the maximum leverage. But if it already went through you still have a claim. Keep all email, texts, communication and everything you can to show the length of time you worked there. Calendar and meetings too. Notes of meetings and all work created during the employment. Get a firm that is familiar with your space. Good luck and let us know what happens. I\u2019m so sorry that they did this. Warning to all: get everything in writing- especially with friends and family. It\u2019s amazing how money changes people. It does. Always. Don\u2019t kid yourself. And if they balk at the idea or say you don\u2019t trust me, huge red flag. They are trying to keep you from exercising your rights to protect your self? Why? Get it in detailed writing! Always!!!",

There is no guarantee unless you own actual shares in the company. I have learned that when I was let go by the startup I worked for just before my options would kick in. I thought I was treated unfairly, but went on to do other things. A few years later the company was sold to their competitor and nobody got their windfall, not even employee no. 2. As it turned out all the options were conditional upon the company going public and since it was a private sale none of that applied. Someone people gave 10+ years to that startup. Nowadays when someone tries to woo me with employee options I tell them to find a bigger fool.",

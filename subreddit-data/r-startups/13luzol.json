A CTO's job is to make the tech decisions about your company and manage your staff. What happens if they make the wrong choices? What if they leave, and don't leave behind proper documentation of what they did and why? What if they don't have a good handle on the development process? That kind of stuff can kill a startup. \n\n*since 95% of a CTO job is management and not coding*\n\nYou're mostly on the right track here. It's good that you realize that most of a CTO's job isn't coding, a lot of startup owners don't get this. That said, although a CTO doesn't *do* a lot of coding, they should still be very knowledgeable *about* coding. One of the CTO's tasks is to be what I call \"the grown-up in the room\". When your devs are doing something ill-advised with the code base, your CTO needs to have the knowledge and leadership ability to step in and tell them how it should be done.",

But at the end of the day, if the CTO is making bad decisions, you may not see the impact for some time. That's what software development is like; mistakes and shortcuts *now* can mean problems *later*. There's a term for it in software development, it's called \"Technical Debt.\"\n\n*they first have to convert the prototype into a polished mvp*\n\nPart of the job application is converting a prototype into an MVP? You're right that that would show their skills, but I have to tell you, a lot of candidates aren't going to be interested in making an MVP for you as part of a job application.",

When I recruit I don't use my clients name, instead I recruit under my name, so I'm the layer of anonymity. You could try posting online with an anonymous account and do some chat in advance.\n\n*if they don\u2019t want to convert the prototype to an mvp that\u2019s great, screening question 1 would already eliminate them as a bad candidate for this job.*\n\nScreening and elimination isn't your biggest problem. One of the truths of recruiting is that the more skills a job requires, the more work you need to do to sell that job to the candidates. Look at it this way. If you're hiring a junior dev, they'll do anything to get hired. They're new to the industry, and they want to get their foot in the door. So while you need to do a lot of screening, you won't have as much of a problem getting the candidates to jump through your hoops.\n\nBut when you're hiring someone with high-level experience, they've got a lot of career options. If they're looking at a bunch of job listings, and yours is the only one making them do an MVP, why should they bother applying? Like I said, they've got plenty of offers to choose from.\n\nYou're asking them to sign an NDA and do tons of free work for you, when the end result is a job offer from a startup that they know absolutely nothing about. They don't even know your name. Why would a good developer accept those terms?\n\nI know you think that I'm trying to give you a big salespitch, but I'm really not. In fact, I'll tell you out right that if you were to hire a recruiter, they wouldn't be able to find you anyone good. No one worthy of being a CTO would apply under those terms.",

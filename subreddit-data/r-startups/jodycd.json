    "postText": "What follows is a rant that is not directed at anyone in particular, just something I want to say to at least 50 people a year who pitch me on their \u201cbig idea\u201d because they think I can help them.\n\n--- EDIT: skip this part if you don't want to hear me brag, I added it to hopefully provide some credibility as to why you should learn from my experience --\n\nI have been fortunate enough to be involved with a couple of startups that went on to achieve unlikely outcomes.  I don\u2019t ever have to work again.  \n\nI\u2019m the guy you know: your friend of a friend, your cousin, your previous coworker.  The guy that got rich from his \u201capp\u201d.  I have been fortunate enough to participate in the process as a low level employee, a CEO, an investor and a founder.  I have been a part of 2 acquisitions in excess of $200M by public companies, in ventures that I started or joined when they were napkin sketches.  In both consumer and b2b, all have been in software (or \u201capps\u201d).  Companies you have heard of (the acquirers at least).\n\nI have authored 7 patents that have been issued by the USPTO, and I can tell you these have almost nothing to do with the financial outcomes I have been fortunate enough to be a part of.\n\nOf the 30+ \u201cideas\u201d that I have poured untold hours and (investors) money in to, only maybe 5 have created any kind of return.  Edit: this is a shocking understatement, as I think about it I have been a part of launching at least 70 apps on the app stores.  A couple got traction.  The rest, in hindsight, bombed.  Millions of dollars burned and tens of thousands of hours - no regrets, the wisdom I have gained is as much from the failures as the successes.  I derived a ton of value from what I learned in the process of trying to execute them as well as I could.\n\nWhile I have been successful by most standards (I am 43 and worth $20M+), I have been a part of raising and burning at least $500M of investor money.  Maybe $50M of that got it back (and then some), around $20M of it got a 10-30x return.  The rest was lost to the brutal landscape of the marketplace.\n\nI\u2019m sharing this because every month I take the time to hear 3-5 \u201cbig ideas\u201d from people who think that if I hear  about their magical \u201cprecious\u201d I will be astonished and be dying to help them build it and get rich. \n\n\u201cIf you want to help me with this I\u2019ll cut you in on it\u201d they say. \n\nGet the fuck outta here!  You think I don\u2019t have 10 precious ideas of my own that I lack the conviction or time to execute - but at least have done the nominal vetting to have a belief in?  Come on man! \n\nIn most cases the \u201cinventor\u201d ends up disappointed with my feedback, and while I realize I could be better at how I give it, there are some consistent themes that reflect a broad misunderstanding of how ideas translate into generational wealth.  \n\nI hope this is helpful and please do not take it personally.\n\nHear me now and believe me later.\n\n-- END OF BRAG SECTION --\n\n\n\u2014 Here Is What Your Idea Is Worth \u2014\n\nZero.\n\nLess than zero, actually, because the minimal time needed to be spent in order to some basic research to validate it, which you haven\u2019t even begun, costs money.\n\nI know your idea is precious.  I know this because I have my own precious ideas.  I know this because I know the feeling I got from buying my first powerball ticket.  In spite of being very fluent with the math I spent all afternoon thinking about what would happen if I won.  After 3 hours of fantasizing it seemed plausible.  And this is so much more than a powerball ticket - it\u2019s your genius idea!  And you\u2019ve been \u201cworking\u201d on this idea for years!  If only you had the time, you\u2019ve got your day job, your car payment, a new kid, etc.  Life gets in the way. \n\nYour brilliant idea... someday is your ticket to the life you imagine.  I\u2019m truly sorry.  It really isn\u2019t.  You carry it around like some kind of magic security blanket that is just a few simple steps away from making you rich.\n\nThe \u201cfeedback\u201d you\u2019ve gotten is bullshit.  Your friends and family love you: of course they are going to tell you it\u2019s great: they would definitely use it, pay for it, invest in it, etc. \n\nImportant: there are also ten billion dollar plus industries who profit from encouraging you to pursue your idea.  Lawyers.  Software dev agencies. Invention websites.  Even the USPTO is funded mainly from guys like you trademarking and patenting your ideas before there is any indication that a business could be built based on them.  In the course of over a billion dollars of fundraising and M&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;A that I have been party to, trademarks and patents have meant next to nothing.  \n\nYour mileage may vary, but be advised that service providers and \u201cadvisors\u201d work for cash and thus are incentivized to encourage you to pursue your idea with little scrutiny.  Ask them to work for equity and see what happens.  If they are credible, and they will work for equity, you might be on to something.  Or they are inexperienced.  \n\nThe ads from \u201cinventor websites\u201d you see on TV are predatory; this is not how ideas translate to money, they thrive on taking your savings in exchange for telling you your idea is great and they will help protect it.\n\n*Please know: when you are secretive about your idea, when you ask me to sign an NDA, when you insist that your idea is worth anything at all; it tells me you are an amateur.  I will not steal your stupid idea.*\n\nThe main, most basic flaws I come across fit into a few categories:\n\n- Competitive research: most often I hear \u201cthere is nothing out there like this\u201d.  Do you even google bro? Upon doing 10 minutes of google or App Store research I can usually prove this is not the case.  There are at least 10M software applications - you really think nobody has had your idea?  It\u2019s not a bad thing: thriving competition is actually a positive indicator to me that there is a market.  How is your approach different?  In most cases I can find 10 attempts at your idea that failed and a couple that show signs of life.  Please be familiar with these - talk to the founders of them, and have a point of view on why your approach will achieve a different outcome than what I can easily find.  When you believe your idea is unique and I can find 19 examples of it that have been tried already, I no longer take you seriously.  Please have talked to multiple people who have tried your idea before you tell me they are a slam dunk.  It\u2019s not hard: use LinkedIn.  I can\u2019t stress this enough: I know it is uncomfortable to do the research and find 17 attempts at exactly what you\u2019re thinking of and none of them are working, but just because you haven\u2019t heard of the companies doing it doesn\u2019t mean it hasn\u2019t been tried.  It would be insane to launch a new venture without understanding what\u2019s out there.  Most skip this step because it can be discouraging - this is where the fun starts.\n\n- Unit economics: sure everyone would want a better widget, but you need to understand the broad dynamics of what it will take to pay for the supply and demand for your product.  If you build it they will not come - I promise you.  You need to expect to have rely cost/effort to make people aware of your product.  You need to have a sense for how your product will be created and how much that will cost.\n\n- Distribution: assume that if your product existed tomorrow, nobody would give a shit.  Build and launch an app?  You can count on 10 downloads in the first week and half of them are bots.  As important as your idea is how you\u2019ll generate awareness for it: half of the successful businesses today are simply taking a proven product or service and finding a new way to distribute it.  These ideas are far more compelling than net new ideas because at least we know there is demand.  A great example is the ghost kitchens that popped up from UberEats and Grubhub: a new mode of distribution suddenly creates huge opportunity for the most obvious thing: a fucking restaurant.  But one with cheap real estate, and no place to sit.  If your idea was to create ghost kitchens in cheap warehouses, now you\u2019re thinking on the right level.  But you weren\u2019t were you.\n\n- Expertise: please do not tell me about your restaurant tech biz when you have neither worked in tech nor operated a restaurant.  It is insulting to both tech people who eat, and restaranteurs who have a fucking smart phone.  Assume that your idea had been thought of by both and if it doesn\u2019t exist, please know it\u2019s been thought of by many of both, and probably attempted.  You need to have some unique insight or right to pursue this concept.  If you aren\u2019t sure, you don\u2019t.  Go back and become an expert in some aspect (domain or tech) of your idea.   You\u2019ll likely quickly learn why it\u2019s much harder than you think.  Every day billions of dollars are wasted by industry experts trying to do tech, or tech experts trying to do an industry they don\u2019t know.  Neither is easy to learn.  You\u2019re on to something when you have one of the two, and a credible cofounder or partner that has the other.  Do not make the mistake of underestimating the creativity and expertise that is resident in the domain you wish to enter.  \n\n- Market: on what basis do companies like yours trade?  For example e-commerce businesses trade on ebitda, saas companies trade on ARR.  Growth rate always matters highly.  There are cases where a highly unprofitable business can be worth billions because of high growth and high margins (see: every public saas company).  There are cases where highly profitable businesses are worth less than zero, because they are shrinking and have shitty margins.  Understand this dynamic and have some semblance of an end in mind.\n\n\u2014-\n\nLook, I get it.  Life is hard - having a pet idea makes it  more bearable. Just like having a lottery ticket.  Just don\u2019t delude yourself.  The market is incredibly vast and competitive - if the idea you have is such a slam dunk, it would have already been done: \n\nYou want to protect your pet idea so you can have some vague hope?  That\u2019s cool, I\u2019m guilty too.  Just don\u2019t bring it to me and not expect me to apply the lens above to it.  If you don\u2019t have good answers to the above questions then you aren\u2019t serious and you are wasting your time and mine.\n\nBe honest with yourself: is your idea a precious token that allows you to imagine being rich and important? Would it be really cool to be the person that came up with it?  I get it.  Just don\u2019t confuse that with an actual premise for a business.  \n\nNot sure?  Go become a deep expert in something and figure out a way to solve a problem in that domain.  You\u2019ll know you\u2019re a deep expert when people seek out your opinion on it.  Until then it is fine if you want to keep deluding yourself with your pet rock, just stop wasting everyone\u2019s time talking about it and for the love of god do not waste your hard earned time and money on it.\n\nEdit: forgot to add one more critical common mistake: stated vs revealed preference.  You will of course get amazing feedback from your friends who \"all of them said they would pay for this\".  It's useless.  So are many forms of customer research and surveys (but not all).  Do not mistake the difference between getting encouragement and getting money.  Most people (even in anonymous surveys) will say they would pay for something that they wouldn't.  Or, they would, but your costs to get in front of them at the right time with the right message, in the wild, make your model untenable (e.g. organic discovery and distribution is a big hack).",

It\u2019s worth noting that even with 40 freemium apps on the market with close to 500K total downloads, I was never seeing more than $100/day come in. The market was already over saturated back then.\n\n10 years later, and many many many ideas later, I\u2019m a year into building an HR SaaS company, and I can\u2019t stress how much this post hits home. We have founder/market fit, we have a great idea, we have an amazing team, we have been part of successful exits. We could build the best product of all time, and never see a dollar. The amount of effort and time it takes to find potential leads, get on their calendars, go through long sales cycles, get buy in, go through security reviews, go through contract reviews, implement the software, iterate on feedback, be always on for customers, etc... is all consuming - and something most people with great ideas just won\u2019t take the time or have the time to actually do. Not to mention it\u2019s expensive to hire the right talent to get there. It took us close to a year of spending $10k/month, working 12-15 hours per day, to get to just $100k ARR.\n\nAll this is to say this post really hit home for me. I provide product and design strategy advice for a handful of startups, and I go off on this exact \u201crant\u201d, whenever I\u2019m asked to sign an NDA by someone who wants to run their idea by me. I know how monetarily, mentally, and physically taxing it is to see an idea through. I won\u2019t take it and run.\n\nDisclaimer: with all that said, don\u2019t go telling your ideas to direct competitors with the resources to build it.",

How much involvement could you really have - even in 5 companies nevrmind 10/20/30+\n\nCurrent tech co-founder of a mental health app. It's taken me and my business partner(marketing, sales and finance startegy). About a year to build something usefull and worth peoples time. That's 12 months.. pulling crazy hours.\n\nHow do you advise, drive and push 70 odd companies... even if it were over 10 years.. I'm struggling to understand where the time for the other 60-65 companies is coming from.\n\nGenuine question, because I hear so many tech guys saying they've built 50 apps in the last 2 years. I'm sorry, but unless you're ripping off the previous app, sightly chaging it and it's super simple becuase it needs no maintenance - you'd still be be in the \"highly improbable chance of success\" area.\n\nHow is it possible to do so much without driving your body and mind into an early grave?",

I don\u2019t think you started out bragging, i think you simply helped us realize that you\u2019re not some random guy giving an opinion, but a seasoned entrepreneur whose learned a lot from your experience. As an iOS Developer I\u2019ve been pretty frustrated with people wanting me to build their app for no pay, while they do nothing, and then giving me 20% equity. It\u2019s madness.\n\nYou mentioned the book \u201c4 Steps to the Epiphany\u201d above, that\u2019s an epic book and I also encourage people to read it, a couple other good books are, \u201cCrossing the Chasm\u201d, and \u201cLean Startup\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve developed a pretty good amount of apps for Startups, and I completely agree, ideas are worthless. Me and my brother laugh about it all the time. People act like their idea is the messiah. But execution is everything. \n\nI do have a question though if you don\u2019t mind answering...\n\nSay you\u2019ve done the market research. You have a strong foothold/expertise in the area. You have a marketing strategy. One of your co-founders has been generating millions in revenue for other industries. You have the team, a 10 year iOS Developer and an MIT grad with a degree in CS who has raised capital for a previous startup. You\u2019ve built the product. You\u2019ve found your niche. You\u2019re executing. You\u2019re getting results, but they\u2019re not quite what you hoped for.\n\nAt what point do you throw in the towel? At what point do you say, this just isn\u2019t going to work?",

They have an idea that is just so awesome that if I hear it I will recognize it\u2019s genius and want to devote my time and energy and money towards it (usually for a laughable stake, considering their idea already exists in the public domain and I could go do it myself).  I\u2019m in the room because they ask me to be. Sure maybe they can fool some dipshit to give them a few bucks.  The market is a beautiful thing and I can make it even more beautiful by helping them prune their tree before they try to plant the seed.  \n\nI am not a professional investor.  I do not ever solicit pitches.  I beat them away at almost every chance.  I am open minded that some will have a concept and plan that is worth some involvement on my end.  I take advisor roles or angel invest in a few things.\n\nI posted this as a reality check so that people can understand that they look like a toddler when they bug someone about their pet idea, in a \u201cmore than casual conversation\u201d way, and haven\u2019t even put enough time into thinking it through and doing research.  \n\nMostly because they have spent their time jacking off to what it might be like to have a home run.  \n\nDoes that help?\n\nEdit:  I think you maybe missed the point.  When I actually meet a person I don\u2019t unload this rant on them.  I ask thoughtful questions and give feedback that I hope is helpful.  Usually they don\u2019t appreciate it, because it\u2019s like showing a lotto ticket holder the math.  I don\u2019t berate them or embarrass them, they embarrass themselves badly enough.",

Ideas aren't worthless, BAD ideas or ANY idea with zero vetting is.  \n\n\n**EVERYONE,**  listen to him he knows WTF he's talking about.  Even IFF he wasn't \"that guy\" he describes himself as,  he definitely know what he's talking about and you should listen to, and ACT ON what he's saying.      \n\n\n [u/ohioguy1942](https://www.reddit.com/user/ohioguy1942/) To my first point ideas with some vetting ( obviously **more is ALWAYS better** ), enough industry knowledge approaching yourself or anyone else shouldn't waste your ) or their ) time, but while most of your assumptions are true for most people,  it's honestly arrogant &amp; presumptuous to think it applies to EVERYONE.  \n\n\nPeople with money are themselves incentivised to belittle TRULY good ideas with real market potential.  That said,  I have to agree, that the majority of ideas SUCK, and of those who don't, only s small percentage of those that don;t are likely to succeed.  \n\n\nWhere  [u/ohioguy1942](https://www.reddit.com/user/ohioguy1942/) goes off the rails, both because he's rich AND because he's incentivised to say ideas are worthless , it's simply NOT true.  Rich people get richer either by doing the Warren Buffet thing OR by investing in \"worthless ideas\" which will give equal r better ROI than the market.  \n\n\nWhile the first iPhone relied on tech to become valuable, tech and execution without an idea of WHAT and HOW to apply said tech is EQUALLY worthless.    \n\n\nTouch screens and programs were around YEARS before iPhone, buy not until the IDEA of putting them together in a phone did they gain so much NEW value that previously didn't exist.  The same was true of the laser, it's famously known as \"the solution without a problem\"  \"[built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser#:~:text=The%20first%20laser%20was%20built,Townes%20and%20Arthur%20Leonard%20Schawlow)\"  was a cool toy created by geeks, and at that time was \"worthless\" since it had no application.  \n\n\nMy point is simple, good ideas with some vetting and real business potential ARE valuable.  Unvetted &amp;/or dumb ideas are as worthless as [u/ohioguy1942](https://www.reddit.com/user/ohioguy1942/) money IFF it's canbe applied to something to grow his wealth, UNLESS he is good just living off his 20M, a problem I'd be delighted to have.  \n\n\ntim #bgreen",

It is almost always a validated and sustainable business.  Even if it is at a very early stage.

You have to have a sense for EV multiples in various business models and what the underlying metrics are that drive it.  You can get lucky when you are young and naive, sure.

I work about 40 hours a month so its a part time role and I have been in the talks with her for the last 2 months to gain equity and she finally gave me a baseline number of 0.1% ( she currently owns 96.5%). What do you guys think?\n\nThe start up is an Educational tech startup, they are NOT considering going down the VC route as much as possible. I really do see a lot of promise in this startup, that's why I will probably stick around for a couple of years after I graduate. The founder mentioned that a evaluation cap within the next 2 year might be as high as 4.5m but its just an estimate.\n\nAs of now the startup does have several contracts and some sources of funding.\n\nWhat are your experiences working in a early stage startup like this? how much pay/equity are you getting vs the work you do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExtra info: I am using [Bubble.io](https://Bubble.io) which is a low code environment kind of like word press, I am the first real \"employee\", although currently classified as a contractor. The founder mentioned that she would want to hire me full time after I graduate next year. Founder is based in DC",

I\u2019d need more details on the business, but for reference, even advisors, who play no operational role in a business, typically get anywhere from 0.25% to 1% in a new venture. She\u2019s offering you LESS than that for a key role it doesn\u2019t sound like anyone else can/wants to do. Again, need more details, but I\u2019d push for a lot more than that. \n\nOtherwise, tell her to pay you market rate for your role. Again, more details would be needed (your skill level, tenure, etc), but go figure out on upwork what it would cost to hire someone with your skills to take on the project.\n\nAlso, given you\u2019ve been working with her over a year, you\u2019re in a position to use that as leverage to see you\u2019ve taken far below industry rate to get the business off the ground. You could use that to push for more equity. Would probably be tougher to use to get more cash\u2026but if that\u2019s what you wanted, then there are things you could do. \n\nAs for how to have the actual conversation, start with figuring out what you want, then get your facts straight, and then just talk with her. Be prepared to walk if it doesn\u2019t go well\u2026and know you made the right move if so. 0.1% is peanuts. \n\nCandidly, it sounds like she has no idea what she\u2019s doing, and you\u2019ll be better off not being involved as she figures it out. You want someone who values what you bring to that table, and based on the facts you have presented, it doesn\u2019t sound like she does.",

I think this is the sort of conversation where it helps to be frank - just state outright that at your current level of compensation, there's not a lot of incentive for you to stay and an awful lot to leave - a year of experience under your belt and you can very, very easily make an order of magnitude more money someplace else.

This should be based on revenue growth and other platform development miles stones. \n\nFirst negotiation to a fair hourly rate (fair on both sides. It is a startup and she can also go else where for no-code, so don't over do it). \nThen ask to work together on these milestones explaining you enjoy working with her and believe in the vision and so want to show your commitment this way. But in order to do that you require her to be fully transparent regarding current business financials. \n\nWhy this approach? \n\nBecause if you agree to lead on project in a meaningful way by asking for these milestones tracked along with incremental pay increases, you also imbed yourself more into the organisation as a product leader. Essentially towards the CPO/co founder route. \n\n8-12 months or so working towards that with a clear track record of contribution to the financial growth of the platform and you can make the ask to join in a more meaningful way (and 20-40% equity in the process).\n\nYou need to demonstrate your value beyond just assisting with mvp GtM. \n\nHappy to expand on any of these ideas/points and how to approach things if it makes sense to do so. \n\nPs: I have made some assumptions here, apologies if not accurate.",

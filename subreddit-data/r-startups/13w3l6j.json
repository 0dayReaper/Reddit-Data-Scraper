We are thinking of launching publicly and then doing allowing users to do referral only to maintain good quality of users in the platform, along with high premiums, similar to these exclusive dating apps. \n\nWhat do you think about this idea ? \n\nAlso,  we are launching our MVP soon with the intention of gaining KPIs from our process, how long should wait before pivoting ?",

Make sure it is worth peoples time to be referred in.\n\n\\- Your second sentence doesn't actually make too much sense. It depends on how you track your KPIs, set up achievable KPIs, and set a destination you want to be at when you plan to pivot. It doesn't need to be a set specific date, just have targets and try achieve them. If you fail to hit them by targeted timescale, then you need to decide a different approach.",

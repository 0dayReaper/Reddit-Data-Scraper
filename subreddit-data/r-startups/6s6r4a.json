    "postText": "Most of the so-called marketing \"influencers\" out there are celebrities.\n\nThey've made it. They're not in the trenches anymore. \n\nThey forgot how to \"do\" marketing; their employees promote their new books for them, build their new websites, launch their new products... all they have to do is sign their name under whatever new projects and Ka Ching! the money starts rolling in their bank accounts.\n\nThat's what I thought when I was preparing my interview with Seth Godin for my podcast called **Everyone Hates Marketers** (how I managed to get him on the show is another story - http://imgur.com/a/1WhxU).\n\nSeth has published 18 books, is regarded as one the best marketing minds alongside Ogilvy or Tim Ferris, so he doesn't need to be in the trenches anymore.\n\nI chose to challenge him to take him out of his comfort zone and see if he still \"got it\". \n\nI asked him to:\n\n- come up with a business idea on the fly\n- explain EXACTLY how he would launch this new business, \n- describe how he would find his first customers,\n- + plenty of other questions\n\nThere was one catch though: he couldn't use his name to promote it, he had only a budget of $1,000, and 90 days to be successful.\n\nWhat follows is the exact process Seth Godin uses to launch a new business (from scratch) with only $1,000 in the bank and 90 days to spare.\n\n---\n**0) Before we start:**\n\n- if you want to read this post on Medium (and give it a clap, why not!), here it is: https://medium.com/the-mission/seth-godin-new-business-5-step-fdb354988c23\n- if you want to read this post on a Google Docs, away from distractions, here it is: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dDXF-AFGCV_2GMLKuyBrrzViQ_ADdgH9uVwpth7f4MA/edit\n- if you want to listen to the podcast episode directly, you can follow this link: https://everyonehatesmarketers.com/seth-godin-marketing-secrets/ (there's no annoying popup, you can listen to the episode directly from your browser).\n\n\n---\n\n**1) Market WITH people, not AT them**\n\n\"*We, marketers, are selfish, lying, short-term thinking scum. We believe that our job is to manipulate people as we market to them.*\" - Seth Godin\n\nThe time of scammy, in-your-face marketing is over. \n\n20 years ago, you could come up with an average product, invest a few thousand euros in TV Ads saying that your product was the best ever, and sell 10,000 units of it.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nPeople are immune to bad marketing. \n\nDon't believe me?\n\nWhen was the last time you bought SEO services from a cold email? When was the last time you subscribed to a new marketing software from an automated direct message on Twitter? \n\nThat's right: never.\n\nWe expect to sell using those shady techniques, yet we HATE it when it happens to us.\n\nThe first step towards a launching a new business according to Seth Godin is to change your mindset. You can't come up with a product or service and THEN decide to market it.\n\nYou have to involve people in the process.\n\nYour customers are humans just like you. \n\nThey're not just a number on Google Analytics.\n\nTreat them as such.\n\n---\n\n**2) Focus on the tiniest audience possible**\n\nIn 2004, Mark Zuckerberg launched a social network for Harvard students only. \n\nLook where Facebook is now.\n\nIn 1970, Yvon Chouinard, co-Founder of Patagonia, was selling \"homemade gear out of the back of his car, supplementing his income by diving into trash cans and redeeming bottles for cash\". \n\nPatagonia is now worth $209M.\n\nI had the same dilemma when I started my podcast Everyone Hates Marketers. I wanted to reach ALL the marketers on the planet.\n\nI realized that I would stretch myself too thin if I was going down this road.\n\nSo I trimmed my audience to the bone: I would focus only on digital marketers working in tech who are sick of shady, aggressive marketing.\n\nThis was the audience I knew the best: I am a tech marketer sick of shady, aggressive marketing.\n\nBy focusing on this small audience I have an edge over the generalist digital marketing podcasts out there.\n\nI can address their biggest, most specific pains. This is what remarkable marketing is all about.\n\nThis probably goes against everything you learned about business. That's because this is the ugly, unsexy part. \n\nNo, you're not going to become a millionaire this year, or even next year. It might take 9 years, 18 years, 25 years, who knows? \n\nSo, how do you pick a tiny audience?\n\nThis part takes discipline.\n\nYou probably have an idea of a product or service you want to offer; now it's time to select the bullseye: who are the people who will benefit the most from using your product or service?\n\nWhen I asked Seth Godin to come up with a business idea on the fly, he came up with a concierge service to help tourists find an Airbnb in Paris.\n\nBut \"tourists\" could be anybody: are we serving a Japanese family looking to go to Versailles for the first time or a Brazilian businessman who want a place to stay near Bercy for a seminar? \n\nSo, Seth trimmed down his audience: he would help Californian families with young kids to find the best place to stay in Paris for their holidays. \n\nThis is much more specific, and, all of a sudden, the problems they face and the solutions we can offer become much more specific, too. \n\nCalifornian families want high-speed internet to talk with their relatives who stayed in San Diego. They want to see the Eiffel Tower from their balcony just like in the movies. They want to taste the best croissants Paris has to offer since they can't find any in San Diego.\n\nSee what I mean?\n\nYou might fear that the audience you're thinking of is too small. \n\nHere's a tip I got from Philip Morgan (an expert in marketing positioning): if there's a conference especially organized for it, then your audience is big enough.\n\nFor example, did you know that there's a conference for handcrafted soap makers (https://www.soapguild.org/conference/index.php)? \n\nThe next one is in Atlanta, Georgia, and 450 attendees are expected. If the handcrafted soap maker conference organizers managed to make money from such a tiny audience, so can you!\n\n---\n\n**3) Create a remarkable product**\n\nOk, ok, this might sound clich\u00e9 but hear me out first.\n\nRemarkable marketing starts with a remarkable product. \n\nBut, what's a remarkable product you ask? \n\nIt's a product that your customers simply CAN'T live without; they love it so much that they tell their friends, who tell their friends, who tell their friends. \n\nYou get the drill.\n\nThe problem is that most of us try to sell average products to average people. \n\nBecause the products are average, customers are not raving about them.\n\nThey don't talk about them to their friends. \n\nAs a consequence, we have to use shady, aggressive marketing to compensate for the loss in business.\n\nDo you think Slack had to use in-your-face marketing to sell their product? \n\nNope.\n\nAnybody can use their product for free - there is no string attached. The product is so good that it IS their marketing. They went from 16,000 Daily Active Users to 2.7 Million in 2 years.\n\nAs Seth Godin mentioned in the episode: did you start using Facebook because you saw their ads on a lifestyle magazine? Nope. Your friends told you about it.\n\nHave you heard of MailChimp because they sponsored a conference you went to?\n\nNope.\n\nTheir email tool was so good that you started to receive newsletters from businesses and people you knew, sent from MailChimp. You checked out their site, tried their email software for free, and loved the experience.\n\nNow here's the hard truth: you're not going to launch the next Facebook, MailChimp, or Slack. They're solving big problems for millions of people.\n\nBut, to start with, you can create a remarkable product for a small audience.\n\nIt\u2019s time to get out of the building and talk to people:\n\n- Identify one of their most painful, unsolved problems\n- Work your ass off to help them solve it\n- Give a sample of your product or service for free\n- Do they rave about it and offer to share it with their friends straight away? You have a winner.\n- If not, collect their feedback and start again.\n\nThis is why Hotjar, the all-in-one analytics and feedback solution for your website, wanted to build a remarkable product. It took them only 4 weeks to come up with the first version of the product, built a very simple landing page, let 1,500 people use it straight away, and gathered feedback.\n\nThe product was so good that those 1,500 early adopters referred an additional 17,500 people in less than a month. At this point,  the Hotjar co-founders knew they had a winner.\n\nThere is no silver bullet in building a remarkable product and it might take you months or even years to find the right recipe, but, if you start with a small audience and gather feedback on the way, your chance of coming up with a remarkable product or service will get much, much, higher.\n\n---\n\n**4) Create an abundance of confidence**\n\nHow do you get the word out about your product or service if you have only $1,000 in the bank?\n\nIn the words of Seth Godin, \"*by giving people an abundance of confidence which will create an abundance of value and all I\u2019m asking in return is to be trusted.*\"\n\nLet's get back to the example mentioned earlier: a concierge service for Californian families who want to get to Paris on holidays and find a place to stay.\n\nTo get the word out, Seth proposes to select the best 50 Airbnbs in Paris, take pictures, and create an amazing 50-page guide of where our potential customers should stay when going to Paris.\n\nThis guide would be available for free, on Medium, for everybody to see.\n\nHe would then contact 10 people he knows who fit the description of his ideal audience and see if they get any value out of it. \n\nIf they do, they're probably going to share this guide to their friends, who will then share it with their friends and so on...\n\nIf they don't, he would improve the guide until they do.\n\nHere's the catch: he would leave his email address at the bottom of the guide, and expect readers to contact with questions.\n\nHe'd give great free advice, engaging with 100 to 1000 people a day back and forth, back and forth, until he'd the indispensable middle man. \n\nAirbnb owners would pay him to write a review about their place, while American families will reach out to find the best Airbnb apartment in the city center of Paris for less than 250$ a night.\n\nThis concept can be applied to any time of products to services: to be trusted you must first give value for free.\n\nThis requires patience.\n\nAt the end of 2016, Unbounce, a landing page software, had more than 16,000 paying customers.\n\nHow did they get there?\n\nThey started blogging six months before their first product release (in 2010), but, what really helped them to become the most popular landing page software on the planet, was a guest post on Moz.com called \"The Noob Guide to Online Marketing\"; a giant guide and infographic containing TONS of value.\n\nThey turned this post into an ebook which got downloaded 150,000 times.\n\nUnbounce got trusted as the go-to online marketing experts, and the rest is history.\n\nCan YOU do the same in your niche?\n\n---\n\n**5) Make a spinner and spin the wheel**\n\nYou might feel overwhelmed by all of the above, and that's ok.\n\nYou might not know where to focus on: there are so many things you could do, so many channels you could use, so many ideas running in your head.\n\nHow do you choose which project to focus on first?\n\nSimple.\n\nJust pick one, or as Seth Godin would say: \"Make a spinner and spin the wheel\".\n\nDo a thing and stick to it.\n\nI used to act like a headless chicken when I started my career: I was impatient, switching from one project to another in a blink of an eye.\n\n7 years ago, I launched a blog about marketing (in French), wrote 9 articles, and stopped because there weren't enough people reading them.\n\n4 years ago, I wanted to create a community for cystic fibrosis patients to connect with each other (my younger brother has cystic fibrosis). I pitched the idea at a Startup Weekend, worked on it for two weeks, and quit.\n\nIt is when I started interviewing no-nonsense marketers a few months that I had an epiphany: every one of my guests, in their own words, mentioned the virtue of tranquility. \n\nIn stoicism, tranquility is defined by: \u201cbelieving in yourself and trusting that you are on the right path, and not being in doubt by following myriad footpaths of those wandering in every direction\u201d.\n\nI stopped checking my mentions on Twitter every 30 minutes, I stopped checking my website stats on Google Analytics every day, I stopped looking at my podcast downloads every Tuesday (when I publish a new episode on Everyone Hates Marketers).\n\nInstead, I've decided to make a spinner and spin the wheel. I've decided to deliver value every week and to stop expecting success to knock on my door tomorrow. \n\nI know that success will come; I just don't know when.\n\nIt\u2019s such a liberating feeling.\n\nSuccess is a byproduct of helping people solve their biggest most painful problems.\n\n---\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n- Market WITH people, not AT them. Your customers are human beings, just like you.\n- Focus on the smallest audience possible. You can always expand later.\n- Create a remarkable product. If your first 10 customers spread the word about it, you have a winner. If not, collect feedback and -\n start again.\n- Create an abundance of confidence. Give away a huge amount of value for free so people trust you in return.\n- Make a spinner and spin the wheel. There will never be a perfect time to do anything: do something and stick to it.\n\n---\n\n**Recommended resources:**\n\n- Seth Godin\u2019s Marketing Secrets to Launching a New Business, podcast episode with Seth Godin: https://everyonehatesmarketers.com/seth-godin-marketing-secrets/\n- Purple Cow by Seth Godin: https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Cow-New-Transform-Remarkable/dp/1591843170\n- Permission Marketing by Seth Godin: https://www.amazon.com/Permission-Marketing-Turning-Strangers-Customers/dp/0684856360\n- Ogilvy on Advertising by David Ogilvy: https://www.amazon.com/Ogilvy-Advertising-David/dp/039472903X\n- Scientific Advertising by Claude Hopkins: http://www.scientificadvertising.com/ScientificAdvertising.pdf\n- The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing by Al Ries and Jack Trout: https://www.amazon.com/22-Immutable-Laws-Marketing-Violate/dp/0887306667\n- Avoid best practices at all costs, podcast episode with David Darmanin, CEO of Hotjar: https://everyonehatesmarketers.com/david-darmanin-avoid-marketing-best-practices/\n- Rand Fishkin's guide to inbound marketing, podcast episode with Rand Fishkin: https://everyonehatesmarketers.com/rand-fishkin-guide-to-inbound-marketing/\n\n---\n\nEdit: If you liked this post, you will probably like the illustrated version on Medium: https://medium.com/the-mission/seth-godin-new-business-5-step-fdb354988c23",

I'm not much of a designer so it only looks \"ok\".  \nI ended up not turning a profit due to the website costs and not selling all the toys I bought in bulk.  \nCreated a Facebook Page and got as many people as I could to like the page. It's surprising how few friends will like your page even when you reach out to them directly. I got a few sales via friends who I didn't really know so that helped. However, I really wish I would have had a referral system in place when I started. People aren't going to get \"excited\" over basic dog toys so naturally they're not going to share the page or website. However, if I had a referral system that benefited them and benefited the people they reached I think I would have gotten more shares which would have lead to more sales. I did spend an abysmally small amount on Facebook ads and got decent click through but no sales from that.  \n  \nIf I did it again:  \n1. Create a referral system that rewards people for sharing your products/content.  \n2. Create more content on the website. Have a blog that showcases \"unique\" ways of using the products.  \n3. Wider variety of products AND/OR more unique/harder to find products.  \n4. Encourage repeat business via an email newsletter.  \n5. Tracking codes - make sure you know where your purchasers came from. This will help you better targets places that are giving you the best return.  ",

If so, there are some books which are tailored towards business people who already understand traditional marketing, but don't understand digital marketing. E.g. E-marketing Excellence. Most posters here might read the table of contents and say \"I know all of this\"; it seems basic in terms of digital. But what's interesting is how it ties traditional marketing, and traditional business concepts, into digital marketing.\n\n\nAfter you understand traditional marketing (and how it links into digital) there'll be a ream of pop-business books whose information will then seem superfluous, but are still fun easy reads e.g. Crossing the Chasm, The Lean Startup.\n\n\nAfter that I suppose scanning through each edition of Harvard Business Review would be a good way to keep up-to-date with theory.\n\n\nAny MBA syllabus for Marketing and Organisational Strategy would be good to work through, if you had the inclination!",

If you had that for every Chapter you'd be laughing.\n\n\nI guess I'd encourage you to think of examples for every thing taught. Because conceptually they're simple ideas, but sometimes they're so simple that you might not internalise them without a bit of forced reflection (at least that was the case for me, to a point).\n\n\nPerfect example, and the reason I wrote my original post: those slides are just chapter 1 from the traditional marketing book, but they make the original article in this OP superfluous. The OP said:\n\n&gt; Market WITH people, not AT them \"We, marketers, are selfish, lying, short-term thinking scum. We believe that our job is to manipulate people as we market to them.\" - Seth Godin. The time of scammy, in-your-face marketing is over. \n\n\nAll he's describing here is the Marketing vs Selling concept, slides 19-20. And knowing about these concepts lets you immediately say \"OP is wrong, forced selling is still used for x,y,z and it's very effective\". These are ideas which are almost a century old. But digital marketers keep rehashing them or reworking them as if they're new. That's not a bad thing, and I suppose it's useful for many people, but I just think it's far more efficient to read one authoritative book on the fundamentals than reading a thousand articles which reinvent the wheel.",

    "postText": "Hi! I just resigned from a startup that I cofounded and I am now trying to settle the issues with the shares that I own in the company without getting scammed and in a peaceful way (if possible). To give some context, I left the company (I was COO) because the guy that I founded the company with (the CEO)\ntried to blackmail me with some shares that we previously PROMISED (big mistake I made, it was just a verbal promised), and then ended up not giving them to me altogether.\n\nHe suggested that I should give him my shares (while also losing 25% of them because I have too many compared to the current employees) and that we would sign a contract that we promises to give me my part after an exit event - quite a shitty option.\nHe now said that he talked with some lawyers and that there is no legal basis for this kind of contract (duuuh). He said that he also talked with the investors who suggested the following option [1], in which I am giving them my shares and I will get their value at the current company valuation\nwhen they have money to pay it. They said that this is the \"industry standard\" but I am trying to do some research to see if this is true (hence this post).\n\nOption [2] would be that I keep my shares in the company, but the investors threatened that I will most likely never make an exit because my shares will not have priority in case of an liquidity event, and due to the fact that most likely not 100% of the company will be sold at once.\n\nWhich option should I opt for? I don't really know what to do. Option 1 means less money and a way shittier deal (but at least some money), but if I choose option 2 they can probably fuck me if they really want to.\n\nWhich is your experience with such scenarios? Which is the industry standard in this case? From my research they should probably buy me out.\n\nTLDR: I quit the startup that I have cofounded and now I need help choosing how to not lose the value of my shares, pls help :)",

Waiting for the next round to buy you out means you'll get bought out at current value while the Series A round is higher. But it's pretty early stage too, and they could just phoenix you out if they really want to. Personally, I'd offer cash now for half the current value and walk away and let them borrow beg or steal to buy you out. If you don't think they can get the cash within a couple of days then that's not going to be worth it. 'when they have the money to pay for it' = never",

Usually you transfer operations to the new company and leave a bunch of debts with the old company which is closed. New company rising from the ashes of the old one is the 'phoenix'. Could also be used to open a new startup with all shares issued to everyone except for the shafted party and then close the old company. There's usually laws to protect people against this, but you have to prove it and pay legal bills while you try though.",

This scenario might require that you go back to the business though if, if that\u2019s something you\u2019d be willing to do. \n\nYou basically ask the CEO to set what they think is a fair price for the shares, and then you have the option to sell yours at that price, or buy his. \n\nYou\u2019d make it a time bound offer. You have to come up with the money within X period of time, or there\u2019s an automatic discount on the shares. You have this discount schedule repeat until it\u2019s practically Pennie\u2019s for shares. It goes both ways.\n\nFor example, they set a price of $1 per share, and the price reduces 20% if they can\u2019t come up with the money in a week. You decide you\u2019re willing to sell at $1 per share. After a week, they still haven\u2019t come up with the cash, so now the value of the shares is $0.80. You get to choose, still sell? Or buy theirs? After two weeks, it\u2019s now $0.64 per share. Still sell? Or buy theirs?\n\nPut the timeframe as something you\u2019d be comfortable with. \n\nBasically it keeps dropping until it\u2019s gets to a point where you\u2019d be willing to buy their shares because it would be dumb not to. \n\nAs mentioned, the biggest challenge here is if they name a price that you\u2019d be willing to buy his shares for, and then you\u2019d need to get back into the business.",

Think through their options and list them out. Find their next best alternative(s). If they have good options you might be screwed and want to take whatever cash you can get. If you find their next best alternative really sucks for them (for example they wait to series A to buy you out at higher valuation and have to explain that to future investors) you can use that to gain the advantage in your negotiation and maximize your deal now. \n\nThis could be as simple as saying pay me out now for $x or I\u2019ll waste your time in court for the next 3 years. If they don\u2019t have the cash to buy you out they don\u2019t have the time or cash to draw out a legal battle. I\u2019m a gentlemen\u2019s agreement type guy and not one for the courts, but these guys sound like they deserve the worst deal possible. \n\nGood luck.",

Did you have a priced equity round investment or was it a convertible note/SAFE investment? Either way in exchange for them buying you out, i would want a convertible loan note for the value of those shares which racks up interest so they have incentive to pay you sooner than later and if they dont pay you after a certain amount of time it converts back into shares at the same valuation you sold for but now at a level of preference as first round investors.",

On second thought just drop the whole convertible portion and make it a straight loan note, even better make it a UCC secured note against the company assets. I suggested the convertible note on the idea that you would want to turn it back into shares with a preference if they didn\u2019t pay you out in a timely manner, but a standard note with an interest rate that compels action, especially if secured, would ensure they pay you ASAP. Secured debt gets top priority after the government when it comes to claiming company assets in the case things go under.",

So the value of the shares at the most recent funding round is usually the best indicator of FMV. Where people usually get screwed in these agreements is when they have stock options and they get clawed back before the next round or a liquidity event. The company points to the FMV as the same as when the options were issued which essentially washes out the value right before the even that would have turned them positive.",

Also wouldn\u2019t that trigger a taxable event for the company because they would be getting the shares below FMV?",

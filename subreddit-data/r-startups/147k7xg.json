Beyond modeling what those businesses did to get those customers, you want to talk to those businesses and figure out a win win relationship with them so that they want to encourage the use of your services. \n\nHere is an example - startups may need services (HR, marketing, accounting, business development) that they can't afford. Businesses that offer those services could point these startups to your landing page because it removes the \"we can't afford this\" objection and puts the startups in a position to buy the services for a longer period.\n\nAnother example - I met a developer years ago that made software that reduced errors on auto loan applications. He had an organization high up in the loan food chain requiring that car dealerships use his software because it improved their \\[I think it was the bank's\\] profits.",

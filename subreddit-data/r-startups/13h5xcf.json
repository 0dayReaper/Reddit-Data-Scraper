I have a solid idea and am doing my user research and scoping now - I've worked in startups for more than a decade and am a very very good product manager so that part is under control.\n\nI need a technical cofounder. I'm planning on an equal split of equity, but don't have funding yet and so can't offer pay, nor am I taking a salary myself. I've reached out to several friends, but with the economy so bad no one wants to take a risk and leave a job right now. Folks who don't have work are solely focused on finding it - and need to be paid. Unfortunately, I have enough savings to support my own family without pay, but not someone else too.\n\nBeyond cash, what would you offer or look for that would be appealing right now?",

            "comment": "Went through this a few months ago... it's tough, but I eventually found a good fit (took just over 2 months). Here's some ideas:\n\nKeep working on the startup and building momentum. Can you create a lean MVP with no-code tools or by manually performing a service? Expect the search to take some time, don't rush it or force it with a bad fit.\n\nBe open to considering someone who can't work on the startup full time and if you do this, make sure it's someone who has the time and drive. A lot of people working 35-40 hours a week in a paid role can find 20-30 hours a week to work on something they're passionate about and that may be enough to get things rolling.\n\nCreate an account on YC Co-Founder Matching and begin filtering through the profiles on there, start having conversations, pitch them like you would an investor (on the potential) and personalise it to what you see in their profile. There are thousands of potential developers, you can contact up to 15 per week: [https://www.ycombinator.com/cofounder-matching](https://www.ycombinator.com/cofounder-matching)\n\nPut ads up on sites and communities where you might find developers who could suit. For example, if Next.js would work in the tech stack you could add a listing to their monthly 'Who's Hiring' thread on Github: [https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/49471](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/49471)\n\nIf there are dev job boards that are specific to the technology stack or industry of the startup, you are more likely to find developers that will be passionate about what you are building. If you put up a job ad, sell the vision / CTO role / equity offering. You are still going to have a large number of applications submitted without the individual reading it properly (or at all i.e. automated submissions). So reply to those who look like a fit with a few questions to ensure they understand what is on offer before spending too much time on an applicant (i.e. don't meet until you have manual confirmation they understand it is beginning as equity-only remuneration).\n\nHope this helps and good luck!",

What you bring to the table: **(A)** a huge, influential network (LinkedIn, Insta, FB, Twitter, whatever best matches the market). **(B)** Capital. **(C)** Golden pedigree that will help \"lubricate\" business development (e.g. industry insider).\n2. Alignment: if I'm already working full time, I've got to really love the idea and feel passionate about it.  I'm working on a travel planning app right now and the only way I could push through it at 2 AM, 3 AM as a side hustle is if I am super connected to the problem.\n3. Customers: if you can get traction via no-code, marketing, and/or just a beta list sign up, that's a great signal that you're on to something.  Even if I'm not 100% on board with a product idea, if you've got a list of 100 people already signed up, that is a really strong signal that you're on to something.\n\nThe worst is when it's just an idea that hasn't been validated; how do I know that if I put 200 hours of nights and weekends into this effort that there will be any value created?  That's the mindset of a technical co-founder that's already working a full time job.  So as a non-technical co-founder, the biggest  is whether you can bring a fully validated idea to the table.",

Once a product is built, it\u2019s relatively easy to attract people who are incentivized to use their networks to sell it. It\u2019s not easy to get product-market fit at that point, but you have something people can work with.\n\nThe product is the way to go from rags to riches. If you have no network and can\u2019t build a product, there\u2019s very little use for you on a preseed team. Best case, you trick people into building things for you.\nThat\u2019s why zuck, gates, Dorsey, musk, bezos, name your tech founder, all came from a tech background.\nThey knew what to build and how to build it. Everyone else was an extension of their minds.",

What seems right in theory at the start, might not end up being so in practice later on.\n\nThe startup I worked for had a pretty crappy initial version that wasn't going to scale. Once we got enough paying users and enough understanding of what is really needed, everything was rebuilt from scratch, but now with tangible information at hand. This ended up being the right choice, although I understand the at different kinds of businesses have different needs.",

High quality dev's get pitched every day about the new startup on the block they should co-found and get asked to work for equity.\n\nWhy don't they take these opportunities?\n\nBecause it's just an idea, nothing else.\n\nYou need to turn your qualitative data into quantitative data. Spend a few weeks talking to as many of your target users as you can. Ask valuable questions. \n\nFocus on breaking the problem you solve into it's first principals, and work up from there. Build a bulletproof set of validation from this. Once you've done that, start looking for a co-founder. But make sure your understanding of the problem and ideal solution is crystal clear. There are 3 things you need to prove to a potential cofounder.\n\n\\- What is the problem, and what is the size of it.\n\n\\- What is the solution, and what is the viability of it.\n\n\\- Would people use this, and how much money could it make.\n\nHope I could help.",

But my posts always get drowned out..\n\nI hope you find my elevator pitch below interesting and reach out!! \n\nI've been pondering a few business opportunities and thought I'd reach out to see if anyone here might be interested in partnering up. It's definitely a bit of a moonshot, but with my experience in manufacturing, construction, and managing successful businesses, l'm confident that we have a strong foundation to build upon.\n\nThe idea revolves around creating an innovative service/product with the potential to make a significant impact in the market. I'm looking for someone who's ready to take calculated risks, work tirelessly towards our shared vision, and help secure the necessary funding to bring our concept to life. We're not talking about a small-scale project here; we're targeting a whopping $100 million opportunity.\n\nI know this might seem like a long shot, but I genuinely believe that with the right partner, unwavering dedication, and hard work, we can turn this dream into a reality. If you're intrigued by the idea of joining forces on a potentially life-changing project, feel free to drop me a DM, and we can grab a virtual coffee or hop on a call to discuss this further.\nLooking forward to connecting with like-mindled individuals and exploring the possibility of exhilarating partnership.\n\nCheers!",

The fact that I could google his name, read articles on his previous venture, is what sold me on exploring a startup idea together for the past months - in the field of computer vision. Unfortunately, it didn't pan out.\n\nFrom that experience I learned that, even more important than reputation, is your attitude: being hungry enough &amp; showing you really care, and that you are really putting in all the work you can to validate the business case &amp; get customers. Not making excuses. You don't need a working product first to validate the business case and to get prospects.\n\nFor an engineer it's easy to show the work you do. Just look at the Git log, the demos, ... I'm happy to put in many late nights of coding, as long as I can trust my partner to get leads, validate the case, narrowing down the use cases that matter the most, etc... That trust is really important, more than cash or other tangible incentives.",

    "postText": "By no means is the story done. I\u2019m just sharing my experience. \n\nMy company is 4 years in, B2B Enterprise SaaS in healthcare IT, Series A, raised $20m, 40 employees and growing. \n\nI\u2019m a first time founder. Worked in this industry extensively prior to starting. Married for nearly a decade. 3 kids. \n\nTo say the least, my spouse is a rockstar. But recently, she\u2019s felt lonely. We make time for each other. Schedule date nights 1-2 times a month. She takes on the majority of the responsibilities with the kids and home while juggling her own career. She\u2019s also having to face her own transition from being a young adult to a full on adult and feels like she doesn\u2019t know who she is anymore. \n\nToday, boy did she let me have it. I didn\u2019t respond well. Gave it right back to her. \n\nThen came the detente. We weren\u2019t really talking. I made dinner for the family. Took the older two kids out afterwards. She put them to bed. She went to bed. Texted good night. I was headed back to the office, but instead decided to just go and say I\u2019m sorry. \n\nWe had a really healthy conversation afterwards. Unpacked a few things that were bothering her. Some of it we could figure out a plan on. Others, we had to accept the uncertainty. \n\nAt the end, things felt better. By no means are we done. We\u2019re going to have more bumps in the road and that\u2019s ok. \n\nI wanted to share this just in case of any of the other founders and early stage employees are feeling the pressure to be great at home and in the workplace. It\u2019s hard. But with a little focus on the people in your personal life, even if it means putting down the work for a bit when you feel like you can\u2019t, can really mean the world for those people. \n\nKeep hustling. Take care of your people. Take care of yourself. We\u2019re all going to be alright.\n\nEdit: quick thank you to everyone!! It was really helpful to see your advice and comments\u2026 especially the entrepreneurs who have went through it before. Wishing you all the best.",

            "comment": "One critical word: boundaries. \n\nMy dad was an entrepreneur growing up, and my mom has never forgiven him for it. She continues to hold a tremendous amount of resentment to this day towards him for being gone so much. \n\nAs a result, in my entrepreneurial journey (I\u2019m on venture #4 now), I\u2019ve set certain boundaries that have worked phenomenally well with my wife and family. For context, married ten years, 4 kids, 6 years and under. \n\n1. I do daddy duty every morning. Get kids up, make breakfast, take them to school\n2. I\u2019m home for dinner every night. Eat with the family, read stories, put them to bed\n3. I don\u2019t work at all Sunday\u2019s. It\u2019s a family day\n4. I try not to work Saturdays if I can help it, but sometimes it\u2019s a crunch. Otherwise, saturdays are \u201cdadventure \u201c days with the kids\n5. I work out 3-4 times a week in the early morning, before my wife or kids are up. It\u2019s the only predictable time I\u2019ve found to take care of myself\n6. Friday and Saturday nights are for my wife. Date nights, gaming, hanging out, you name it. Whatever she needs\n7. Outside of this, it\u2019s ALL work. I work from 5-7a on days I don\u2019t excercise, 8a-6p on weekdays, and 730-10p every week night except Friday. It adds up to about 65-70 hours a week, and has been sustainable\n\nMy first startup I did 100+ hour weeks (before kids) and not only was it NOT sustainable, but I felt like it risked my marriage every day. I just never saw my wife. \n\nIt\u2019s all about knowing your boundaries, sharing them, and sticking to them. \n\nGood luck!",

No one is efficient after 50 hours. I know it because I\u2019ve lived it in consulting with some of the strongest mental powerhouses. After 50, it\u2019s a fight to remain a whole human and care about anything else like a family, pets, friends, other investments, health, etc. \n\nOP said 1-2 date nights a month. I laugh because we get that per week. Anyone that knows me will tell you it\u2019s because I set clear boundaries. So does my wife.

They do all their work, and usually takes about 20, at most 30m to be in bed. \n\nThen, depending on a number of factors, sleep can take anywhere from 5m to two hours. \n\nWe find if they\u2019ve been outside and run around a lot, gotten a lot of fresh air, exercise, etc then they tend to wind down much, much faster. But if we\u2019ve had an \u201cinside day\u201d, if there\u2019s been a lot of screens, media, etc, it can take anywhere from a a few minutes to hours for them to go to sleep, because they\u2019re all hyped up and play in their room. \n\nMy older boys share a room, as do the twins (different room). They all do a fantastic job of staying in their rooms with lights out, and we don\u2019t have any toys in their rooms. But they end up talking, playing around with their blankets, pillows, pretending\u2026it\u2019s a production!\n\nOur policy is as long as they don\u2019t turn on their lights, leave their room, or make too much noise, then we\u2019re fine with it.",

It can be really hard on your spouse when you throw yourself so completely into your business\u2026 and of course we do it telling ourselves \u201cit\u2019s for them too!\u201d\u2026 and it is, but it\u2019s not all that they need. Talking along the way is always the best option. Do not let things go unsaid. Be open about the sacrifices on both sides as it relates to the grind of building business. We made it though thankfully, and we had the best years of our marriage following that low point. A few years later she passed away and I regret not spending more time with her back then, but I\u2019m thankful we made it through the tough spot and had the last few years together, and they were amazing (right until she got sick). Together for 22 years before she passed. Married for 16 of those years.  One thing I\u2019ve learned since she passed\u2026 try being a startup entrepreneur without the love and support of your partner holding down shit at home\u2026 damn near impossible. Make sure you appreciate that side of the equation.  Congrats on your success.",

Wild times. I don't know if my startup will be successful,  but I know it comes down to gratitude. I am glad I have a supportive partner and gracious co-founders because even then it was hard as hell. I couldn't imagine my life without that support. But I know there is a chance I might have too and still find joy without him on this earth. His cancer can come back. And there are many days I just wish the company was successful and sold. That way I could provide for him and we could travel whlie he is in great health. Regardless of how much time I have with him, or any of my loved ones, I am blessed they were/are in my life. \n\nWill I do another startup? Likely because I love it. But I would prefer to start one where I can spend much more time being present with those I love. \n\nSo happy you had beautiful years together!",

If you don't have a CAP table that prevents you from selling 'low' you should consider it if you are a first time founder. It will give you the money and time you need to live comfortably and also have 'fuck you' money for your next business. Importantly you can spend time with your family.

Some had to do with funding, some had to do with the fact he was doing a startup while raising a family and bringing the stress home or not being home. What a horrible roller coaster that was as a kid. \n9 years in, they were able to exit but unfortunately he didn\u2019t make the kind of F-U money that was supposed to make the chaos worth it (it was one of the first online trading platforms for brokers and was eventually sold for over $500M). He makes that now in a different career in finance as a wealth manager (started post 45). Mom and Dad divorced, and he\u2019s seeing all his investments pay off now 20 years later. The people he worked with those days do not speak with him today and vice versa. \n\nThat lesson never left me. Yikes. \n\nToday? I\u2019m married to a high-powered guy in the tech industry. My husband isn\u2019t as smart as my dad, and isn\u2019t as big of an asshole. I traded that version of a guy with one who would still be successful but with a measured approach to the realities of this kind of career. We also both wanted a family, so we knew early on I\u2019d be staying home, I have a side biz that I\u2019m able to do around everyone\u2019s needs to keep my sanity but I could close it down tomorrow and it wouldn\u2019t matter. I planned to do a big career once the kids are in their 20s and busy. That said, we haven\u2019t had a date in years. No biggie. I see him at dinner and at night for a bit everyday. We put the kids\u2019 futures first (I literally homeschool them). I think he\u2019s grabbing drinks this week with some agent and I\u2019ll tag along to that. I couldn\u2019t imagine scheduled date nights and being able to successfully work on what we are doing- there just isn\u2019t the time. \n\nTell your wife to hang in there. She\u2019s in the thick of it, but there is a brighter future ahead for the family, if you pull it off together. Is it possible to pull money off the table during your next round so she can quit working, if she wanted too? Just wondering what it is she feels she\u2019s needing.",

I wake up in the morning, do the daycare drop off get to work at 8. Usually work through or smash lunch. \n\n.. My wife does pickup. It's required a lot of discipline but unless it's an emergency or the odd networking event which I'm more selective with these days I try to be home by 6 sharp.\n\nAny time there is a grant or something along those lines I'll pull a late one after 9. \nI try to work from home 1-1.5 days a week.\n\nNot sure your role but remember that you as co founder are also setting an example for your employees and staff with your priorities. We spend a lot of time on culture. Define your values openly.",

I mean you had evtl bad bosses and no freeom to operate now you have potentially financial stress? Thanks",

My work consumed my mind and even when I was with my kids, I was thinking about work. With the company,  I realized I was always chasing something that was just 20% out ahead of me. When in reality, I could have ratcheted back a little on my frantic pace and my output for the company would have been the same, but my mental health and quality time with my family would have been improved. It's been a year since that prior company, and it feels like i'm out of a fog and can see more clear now. Growth companies with a family is tough.",

I had to learn skills like copywriting, content creating,sales to mention but a few. I\u2019ve been able to fight through the bumps and all of that and still stand stronger. My business raked in 6 digits last year thanks to social media. Ps; the teens are on IG these days. I\u2019m currently shooting for a bigger target.

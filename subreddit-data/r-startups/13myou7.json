How did you get past them?",

The question that you really want to answer is how do I know that the problem is worth fixing. And the answer to that is you\u2019ll know if you created a valuable solution to a problem if you would use it at your expense or your target consumers have shown you purchase intent. \n\nAny method of validation that doesn\u2019t include the customer paying is useless. In business an idea is only valuable if it is worth buying.",

As others have pointed out, you need to sell your product and have people using your product.",

We can't tell them what the problem is. I feel like until we build the solution, we can't know for sure if we are onto something. It all comes down to probabilities, doesn't it. It seems many founders are very confident, and I wonder if confirmation bias comes into it. I feel like I wax and wane between optimism and pessimism, but I'm still in the discovery phase.\n\nWhat do you think your riskiest assumptions are that are important? One may be that people will pay for your product.",

What are some of the best things to do today in hopes of raising a seed round next summer? How would you approach getting contacts? Etc.\n\nI heard Twitter is a place I need to be. Any validity to this?",

The reason is because of the chicken or the egg problem. You see, for marketplaces to generate value they need users, but for users to join the marketplace they need value. See the problem?\n\nNo investor will fund you unless you can show how you will overcome this chicken or the egg problem. The way this is usually done, is by creating a venture that is totally focused on delivering value to a single stakeholder. Then you can start bringing on the other stakeholders to gain value from the initial ones, given the proper business model.\n\nI highly suggest you look at NFX, they are on the best VCs on the planet, and they specialize in, guess what... marketplaces. They have a lot of great content you should be reading up on.\n\nI would start [here](https://www.nfx.com/post/the-nfx-marketplace-scorecard)\n\nGood luck to ya",

Not looking for an idea validation. Just tips if you have any.",

The best way to get investment is to get paying customers. I would focus entirely on revenue growth. You should start making a list of wealthy people you know, and anyone you know who is adjacent to investors. Another strategy is to look for partnerships with larger companies. This is good for traction and can also be a source of investment.",

So instead of having to train a customer on an entirely new experience, you can learn from and improve upon what's already out there. Just offer a mild, niche point of difference\\* to get early traction.\n\n\\*Point of difference does not always mean product feature. It also can mean marketing, sales, or operations. You can offer the exact same experience but have an untapped marketing strategy, or maybe you just have a deeper network of leads.\n\nIf anything, you should be scared of ideas that are too original, because it's going to be expensive to train users on what to do with your product. Not a reason to abandon the idea by any means, but it's something you should consider.\n\nAnd truthfully most the ideas we think of as original aren't. It's just the version of the idea that got the most press. My personal success comes from launching into *very* saturated app categories. But setting aside my anecdote, there's\u2014\n\n* Facebook launched against Myspace, Friendster, and LinkedIn\n* Google against WebCrawler, Lycos, Yahoo, AskJeeves, AltaVista, fucking Dogpile\n* VRBO had been around for 13 years before Airbnb\n* I hope I don't need to tell anyone how many mp3 players existed before the iPod\n\nI honestly think you'd have a harder time finding a successful business that *didn't* enter a competitive field. The caveat I would add to all this is to watch out for ideas with a clear dominant player. E.g., it would be hard to launch a search engine against Google in 2021. But even still, there's room to disrupt. Look at DuckDuckGo, basically just pulling its search results from various APIs of existing products. They're sitting on a $100M valuation. You don't have to win the category to be successful.\n\nMoral of the story, don't set the bar so fucking high for yourself and just try something. Believe in yourself, etc. End rant.",

And indeed since timing is a key factor, - that is, ideas, products, services whose time has come- there is nothing better than competition to train clients, advertise your product, set benchmarks, spur you on etc. In Peter Thiel 's' Zero to One' world the ideal company is so innovative that it can become a de facto monopoly. It's not always the case :\n-  Nvidia or Arm have carved out impressive' niche ' positions, TCMC is simply the best at what it does, as is Amazon on all its fields\n- execution (so, people) is the key success factor.\nI'm about to exit an investment in a groundbreaking deep learning data management company. Terms are fine - touch wood - but I have no doubt it will eventually become 100x to 1000x more successful, given time and resources. It was too ahead of its time - amongst other things - to achieve the success it was destined to.\nLast points\n1. time : it usually takes decades to become an overnight success. Facebook is so impressive because it became so successful so fast. Most startups fail and, most of the most successful ones take an awfully long time to become really successful (not just from a fundraising standpoint but from a sustainable business model standpoint)\n2. Don't ever believe you got it made. There is not such thing as unattainable market domination, over time. Once in a blue moon, a company will reach Peter Thiel's wet dream of leadership and huge value-added to clients compared to its cost. Cue record growth and sky-high margins. Sometimes patents will protect some of that enviable situation for some time. But eventually challengers come and eat away at your margins and leadership. Intel looked so far ahead of any competition 20 years ago in a business line that is hugely capital intensive and is incredibly risky. Look at its market cap today, compared with AMD or Nvidia.\n\nSome stories in that mould :\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.comhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/steve-jobs-in-rare-video-all-the-work-ive-done-will-be-obsolete/#app/news/steve-jobs-in-rare-video-all-the-work-ive-done-will-be-obsolete/#app\n\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/12/microsoft-edge-will-now-warn-users-about-the-dangers-of-downloading-google-chrome/",

He also goes on to say that it is a hell of a lot easier to be faster than smarter.\n\nThere is a lesson for any business lying in there, I think. People naturally gravitate towards innovation for obvious reasons but in reality most are better off (trying to) recognize a good idea when they see one and then get in early but focus on *better implementation.* Anecdotally, the guy who really got rich off McDonald's (Ray Kroc) didn't \"invent\" the concept, he just recognized a brilliant idea and made it huge.",

Maybe you don't remember at first, but google succeeded because:\n\n* you can find for part of the word, for example, if you used yahoo, then \"cat\", returns all the topics with the word \"cat\".  If you used google, then \"cat\" returns all the topics that **contain** \"cat\", for example, caterpillar.  So the results were more extended and easy to find some information, i.e. people found that Google was better.\n* google was more minimalist. Back then, the internet was crappy and some customers still used modems.  Google used fewer resources and less bandwidth, so it was faster than yahoo.\n* Google wasn't a directory, neither it tried to be one. Yahoo was a directory with a search feature.\n\nSo while Google didn't create the concept of \"search engine \" but it truly innovated.\n\nIt is the same with other services such as Facebook. Copying others will not help a new company. Adapting it, giving a better support, price, quality and features is what it counts.",

Why are you different? Why would people pay for you vs the other options in the space?  Etc..\n\nIf someone pops into an idea thread to say \"this was already built\" and it's a surprise to whoever posted the idea, they should take a hard look at what they're doing.  \n\nSort of related to that is that if someone wants to have a real discussion about an idea on /r/startups, it would be helpful to acknowledge known competition and such.\n\nHaving said all that, a well-populated existing market with lots of competition is a great sign that there are people out there in the world who are willing to pay a lot of money for a product.",

They do a great job marketing their products. Creating brand fidelity like that is rarely seen in this era of consumerism. So I feel as long as you have a decent product to sell and a market segment in mind and you do a good job of bringing a solution to their pain points, communicate it well, just go for your idea!\n\n  \nThere\u2019s always databases and tools just to have an overview of what your idea is going against. Crunchbase is a good option just for a basic view of the competition, but if you want to go more in-depth, monitor them over time, or find some other partners that can help you in your development process, I\u2019d recommend tools like Novable.

Disrupted the whole auto industry and opened doors for many more to come in. Rivian, Nikola, Lucid, and a million others. \n\nAlso, the new tech, Blockchain, Web 3.0, etc. is an amazing opportunity for a new startup to take on Google. Think about it this way. Google is centralized. But the fancy \"word\" on the street is \"decentralized\". The whole meaning of it is just a great marketing tool to use and go against Google. I am not saying you should target to bring down Google. No, but I am saying you can do like Tesla and take some of that market share from Google. \n\nRemember.

    "postText": "\nhey, i\u2019m 17 turning 18 next month and have 3 months off for summer until i get back to my final year of school. I am looking for a job but no immediate success so far, I have been approached my a lady who is a landlord and rents out her house, and she is looking for me to do some handyman work and maintenance for that house, she found me from a facebook post I put up looking for some work locally.\n\nI am meeting her in 2 days and will be able to hopefully clarify more what she is looking for and how well I will be able to meet her demands, it\u2019s not full time work, but she said can be long term. Regarding my own experience, I am interested in construction/carpentry/woodwork, i have done a little bit of work experience with a carpenter, and some small wood projects myself at home. I am eager to learn more as it could be a possible career for me.\n\nMy main question is about pursuing handyman work as a side job during the summer and possibly even into the future depending how it goes. Although I don\u2019t have a massive amount of experience in a wider sense, I am very willing to learn and i can see the importance of knowing how to fix/make things on our own around the house which I am sure others can too. I am not in the US, so i don\u2019t have access to apps like craigslist/nextdoor, but i do think Facebook community groups and using my own contacts/referrals could work if I put time into it. \n\nI\u2019d appreciate any help, thank you",

You should have liability insurance for sure.\n\nI don't mean this as an insult to you specifically. You are young and I wouldn't trust a 17 year old to do much more than yard work, sprinkler system or a fence repair, even then I wouldn't expect much. But I don't know your skill/knowledge level. Just keep this in mind when discussing this with her.",

    "postText": "Like many of you, my company has decided to go fully remote during the peak of c0vid. This was a company-wide decision where everyone weighed in the pros and cons.  \nAt first, I actually celebrated this move (I've always been a bit of a homebody) even though as the CEO, I was slightly concerned about overall team performance.  \n(Some might remember my post about this).\n\nWell, 3 months after making the transition to remote work I can confirm that team performance was indeed affected.  \nPersonally, I found myself feeling increasingly lethargic, with no motivation, depressed even - all the typical burnout effects. My teammates also reported similar feelings - my sales team being the most affected by this transition.\n\n**We had no option but to make this issue a company-wide priority that had to be dealt with immediately.**\n\nGoing into this, we supplemented the move to remote with all the go-to team/company productivity sop's, guidelines, and tools you'd expect (slack, etc.) but we completely ignored personal-level ones. The integration of the latter is what made a world of difference.\n\nAfter surveying our staff (20 people strong) we decided to create our own internal \"hierarchy of needs\". **Sleep, movement, nutrition, and time-off-screen** became essential metrics (actual rules to live by) for everyone.  \nUnder those guidelines, we were quick to find and test an array of solutions to ensure personal accountability, ultimately, so that everyone was on the same boat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Our self-care/personal productivity stack:**\n\n**Rescue time** (rescuetime.com)\n\n\\- I\u2019ve used Rescue Time on-and-off over the last couple of years but didn\u2019t get to fully dive in until recently. Getting granular visibility on how you\u2019re spending time in front of a screen has been extremely helpful.\n\n**HeadSpace** (headspace.com)\n\n\\- I'm not one to rave about the benefits of hardcore meditation but the stress relief benefits of a daily session are too many to ignore. Plus, the team responded well to the gamification component of the headspace platform.\n\n**Rise Science** (risescience.com)\n\n\\- Sleep is everything! We found that optimizing sleep was the biggest catalyst in mitigating employee burnout/personal churn. Such a simple concept to grasp, yet very hard to implement consistently. Two important concepts Rise brought to the table: 1)Sleep Debt 2) Circadian peak optimization.\n\n**Oura Ring** (ouraring.com)\n\n\\- Initially, I was a bit skeptical but we decided to incorporate Oura into our stack (biggest investment we made, but well worth it). The spectrum of data insights it offers is pretty bananas.\n\n\\---\n\nIts been approx 2 months since we integrated a company-wide personal productivity/self-care policy and the results have been great. Everyone is having fun.\n\nIncorporating a feedback loop at a personal level has shown how closely work bleeds into one's personal life. **This can wreak havoc on mental health** if your company doesn't take the right measures to prevent it.\n\nAfter going through this transition into remote work, I believe that more companies should give their employees remote-specific care packages and adopt wellness-first policies over strictly performance-based ones.\n\n**I would love to hear your feedback and recommendations on this one!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS. I have no affiliation with these companies.  \nPPS. Obviously, our employees did not pay for these out of their own pockets.",

Maybe if the work culture has spiralled that badly then you might need them to ween the team into something more healthy, I don't know, but it seems like lighter handed interventions like saying \"get off your computer outside of work hours\" is probably better and less *weird*.\n\nOn my team we all just have a bit of a ritual of saying \"bye, have a good evening\" or something to that effect on slack to let team members know we're done for the day. It's simple but I think it has some good effects like setting boundaries for team mates (don't bug me) and setting boundaries for yourself (why work longer than you're giving yourself credit for?). The only thing to watch out for there is that it doesn't turn into a spiralling mess of people trying to be seen as working longer like in office presenteeism.",

I have managed remote teams and in-person teams ranging from 5 to hundreds of people so please know this comes with the best intentions: \n\nIt sounds like what was really going on here is that your employees were having difficulty setting work boundaries, and this is very common when companies go from in-office to remote (ie, there\u2019s a clear separation of mental concerns when you go work at an office vs at home).  Working from home is not for everyone - to maintain a healthy balance you need to be both extremely disciplined as a company and as a person with your time, or else you run into what you were describing.  Anyways, from my experience having to resort to such drastic measures like you\u2019ve done is usually a sign theres something cultural within the company that was effecting everyone\u2019s ability to set boundaries.  \n\nSome rhetorical questions for you:  Do you have managers sending people emails/slacks at all times of day?  Are people expected to answer emails/slacks at all hours?  If not, has this been explicitly mentioned to them?  Do you encourage your employees to shut off their work computers / work phones after 5 (or whatever their hours are, unless they deliberately want to work)? Do you have expectations that they should be working \u201call the time\u201d because as the owner of the company you likely are (see my first point in this paragraph on this).  These are the things that ultimately need to be implemented or changed to really create a healthy work from home environment.  \n\nAgain, I like what you\u2019ve done here to try and fix the remote work issues and am glad it\u2019s working, but it drives me absolutely nuts when companies try and infringe on people\u2019s personal lives outside of work or set unrealistic expectations for their team (not saying this is you, but it\u2019s common in the cases like what you\u2019ve described).  \n\nAs an employer for all these people, I believe it\u2019s your job to set them up for success in both their job but also make sure that work time doesn\u2019t infringe on the other areas of their lives by setting clear boundaries and expectations.  If you can master that you\u2019ll have built your remote system to last.  \n\nNote:  work boundaries are notoriously difficult to set for outside sales teams since they are likely working from their phones.  This is where expectations of when/how to answer emails, texts, slacks, etc is so crucial.  \n\nI hope this was somewhat helpful, and keep up the good work.  I especially like what you\u2019ve done to take initiative to help people with their mental health.",

I work for a large company (100,000+ employees) and while they offer a lot of similar services/tools for stress release, mental health, etc, I actually don\u2019t really use them as I prefer to treat myself for those concerns in my own, personal ways.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m able to do that is because of my manager\u2019s respect for boundaries, including: \n\n1. A suggested but not enforced \u201c9-5\u201d screen time policy. \n\n2. A \u201cno questions ask\u201d approached to putting unlabeled breaks/appointments onto my calendar during business hours, during which I shouldn\u2019t be called or scheduled for meetings.\n\n3. An encouragement to use free office-hours time when work is slow for fulfilling and contributive learning and passion-projects (for the company).\n\n4. Gratitude for each and every instance of \u201covertime\u201d (working outside normal hours). If a project has a tight deadline or we\u2019re dealing with timezone differences, it is always verbally communicated that our efforts are EXTRA and not mandatory, and that because of those efforts, we get the lovely benefits of the \u201cno questions asked\u201d breaks and the such.\n\n\nThis approach has been tried in both very busy months and very slow ones, and it has worked for me for both. I\u2019m not at all implying that your company isn\u2019t doing these things, but rather that boundaries are just as important as tech tools/benefits in regards to the wellness of employees.",

During that month, I made a few changes that have completely changed my work from home experience:  \n1) Block time on your calendar for breaks and lunch. Force yourself outside at least twice a day, even if for a short walk.  \n2) Buy an adjustable/standing desk. I rotate between sitting and standing every hour.  \n3) Buy a Peloton. If you aren't good at getting yourself moving, you can do 10 minute workouts to keep your body and mind in good shape.\n\nI'm excited by the remote work revolution, but also growing more skeptical. I wonder how many employees will be eager to go back after \\~2 years at home, and how many companies will pull back their remote work policies as they see employees struggling. At the very least, these companies need to use the money they're saving on real estate to help their employees set up healthy workspaces in their homes.",

Being a relatively young/small company    I have to admit that we were ill-equipped to deal with some of the pressures presented by working in a fully remote environment. (as well as under covid circumstances).  \nFor better or worse, this is a decision we took as a team. Going in, we collectively delineated a set of guidelines in regards to \"fundamentals\" to ensure people were respecting each other's schedules as we knew that could be an issue (as you very well highlighted). However, that just wasn't enough, as we soon found out.   \n\n\nIn addition, I'm blessed to work with absolute warriors that, very much like myself, have issues with setting up hard boundaries between work and their personal lives (\"*I can always squeeze in another call, another email, etc\".*) This is where we had to make the biggest cultural change -Looking back at it, \"gamifying\" this cultural pivot with wellness tools it's what really made it stick.  \n\n\nUltimately, changing to a wellness/health first approach really gave us the perspective necessary to make the right adjustments. It's still very much a work in progress though but we're fully committed :)",

I applaud the OP for recognizing how important mental health is and taking some actions to help it in the workplace, but it seems like the issue of boundaries isn\u2019t quite solved yet and is mixing a lot of personal with work.   \n\nEDIT:  instead of gamyfing these things and expecting people to use these tools and report on them together, I\u2019d recommend just offering to pay for these kinds of things instead.  Now you\u2019re separating work from personal and really supporting them.  Ie, don\u2019t schedule a yoga class every day for your team to go to together - offer to let them expense a gym membership.  Expense appointments with counsellors or social workers.  Offer a budget to buy at-home fitness equipment.  Just don\u2019t make them report on these things at work unless they bring up health issues with their managers. \n\nEven using words like \u201cwarriors\u201d and praising your employees who work extra hours has a profound effect on your company culture - essentially what that message is sending to everyone at your company is \u201cif you want to get praise from me, you need to hussle and eat, sleep, and live this job.\u201d  So now everyone in the team subconsciously thinks that to get noticed here they need to work overtime all the time.   No matter what you implement, boundaries you set, etc, as long as you praise people for working extra hours that\u2019s going to be the case.  To promote the culture you\u2019re looking for, you want to praise the kind of things like \u201cman, this person crushed it with their role within their work boundaries\u201d. \n\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong.  There are times when you need to hussle and get stuff done and it\u2019ll take you outside the boundaries, but that\u2019s got to be the exception and not the rule. \n\nAlso, although I\u2019m obviously not a big fan of this, there are companies that deliberately have a company culture where you expect people to bust their ass all the time for the job, burn out, and then fire them and hire someone new after 2-3 years.  And you can achieve results that way for your business, but if that\u2019s what you\u2019re going for I wouldn\u2019t delude yourself with ideas of helping people\u2019s mental health.  Set the expectations that this job is all consuming and hard time-wise when they sign up, and if it\u2019s not for them they shouldn\u2019t join or stay.   This is a bit of an aside as it\u2019s not what the OP is wanting to do, but wanted to note that this is also a way to conduct things.\n\nTLDR - doing a good job but I fear these wins are going to be short lived without addressing the rest of the issue.",

All of this effort is basically around you keeping a productive routine. Most of this applies in my opinion to non-remote work anyway.\n\nI have ADHD, and 2020 made me really focus on getting help.\n\nMy tools so far for surviving remote work + ADHD have been:\n\n1. Redefining my approach to working (harder than you think)\n2. Proper planning/notes, paper+pen.\n3. Walking at least 15 minutes everyday.\n4. Vitamins (regular everyday kind)\n5. Sleeping Pill that worked (this one helped the most than I expected)\n\nAnyone looking into this, if you have the money and desire go for these tools go for it. I will caution to anyone that THEY ARE NOT A PANACEA.  If you cant afford these things, you should not feel like living/working peacefully is out of reach. \n\nAs an employer I would never even consider suggesting my team do certain things for their mental health. I respect their autonomy/boundaries, and honestly if they wanted to ask they can ask. \n\nI'm just surprised you bought this for you team. That is what strikes me as paternalistic about your relationship with your employees. I guess why not start subscribing to a vitamin brand and send them monthly deliveries. Maybe send them special alkaline water too. Mail them some new copper infused underwear.  Now I got snarky. I apologize. But hey that's the internet.\n\nHonestly, what everyone needs in every business is fucking boundaries. If everyone defended their personal boundaries against the pressure of business it would help everyone up and down stream.\n\n2020 kicked my ass even though my company was already 100% remote. Remote work didn't do this to us, stress/pressure/change broke us, and that can come in any form.\n\nI saw this and I just couldnt help myself from replying. I blame my ADHD.\n\nGood Luck.",

When they say its lonely at the top, it really is.  There is a lot of different things that happened to get me to refocus.\n\n1) Reflection. I honestly had to just fucking stop for a bit and go \"what am I doing with my life?!\".  I was spending a lot of energy answering really-small questions (email/phone/task) level issues, and avoiding answering the big ones (life, family, retirement, goals etc,.). I just had to stop the bus for a bit and think for myself and review where we were at with my wife.\n\n2) Realignment. I knew I couldnt make a big change, i'd lose a lot of momentum if I just up and quit. So I decided to just make small changes towards what I wanted to do. If I didnt have a plan about family, we started to make a plan to plan. If that makes sense.\n\n3) Boundaries. There was a good book I listened to on vacation about Unfucking your Boundaries, in it I realized that I had really bad boundary setting habits and let the world influence me more than I thought I did. While I didn't just start pushing back immediately, I made a commitment to hold firm to what I wanted in my time/business/life.\n\n4) Buffers. I would schedule things hour-to-hour back-to-back, and that was exhausting, I thought that is what I should do. I started re-doing my weekly/daily schedule to basically avoid talking to anyone on schedule until 10AM.  Somedays it works, somedays I break the rule. But usually I need that ramp-up time before I start talking to people.  \n\n5) Early on I was a big proponent of Getting Things Done, and the act of planning/scheduling/actioning the next action of a task once I receive it. Kind of lost my way after 10 years of professional life. \n\n6) Employees are awesome. Not that I thought they weren't before, but my lizard brain saw them as sources of fires instead of agents of authority/autonomy.  It makes sense though, I'd give them an unclear goal/task, and they'd always come back asking for help/guidance when I had zero time to give it. This wasnt easy, but I made a key hire to help with day-to-day operations, and I impressed upon them the importance of understanding tasks/directions and giving them the authority to get it done. Plus with enough of them around they start to collaborate on their own and generate their own solutions before you even need to get involved. There is a lot of culture building here that is necessary to do it, hopefully I did right.\n\n7) Financial Modeling. Excel, CashFlow Forecasting, Profit First. Figure out \"how much is this worth the energy/risk\" ... figure out what you want for working 52 weeks a year. $X salary plus $X net profit. I'm not exactly where I want to be, but I can see a path to get there. \n\nAs for the result. I'm feeling a lot more in control. I feel like I was back in June of 2019 (in the before times). I can sleep. I can work without anxiety. I can celebrate my successes. That is a win for me.",

You still have people looking to meet performance goals, just on a different platform.\n\nOffices should stay closed for good, people should have flexible work arrangements. But if you want wellness to be a part of that then you need to give people more autonomy, not less. A ring to track biometrics is not more autonomy. Competing to meditate is not autonomy.

Reflecting upon it a bit, I think there a few things serving as the glue that keeps the band together.\n\n *OKR's for goal setting*\n\n *Heavy usage of video conferencing technologies with a must have \"camera on\" expectations*\n\n *Daily huddles that cover yesterdays work and the days work ahead*\n\n *Slack and MS Teams*\n\n *Agile framework utilizing two week sprints*\n\n *Virtual happy hours / team builders*\n\nI think working remote does affect some more than others but for the most part it is difficult for me to see us ever going back to 100% on site. One thing to note is that tech workers tend to be introverted so the remote lifestyle is probably bliss for some if not many.",

Guess it depends on the people. My team has been remote since forever but yes we are all tech guys. Management gave up and in the end the biggest proponent who tried to push this way of working left soon after.",

I'm not sure why it works for us to be honest but I do think the teams worked closely from a collaboration perspective prior to the shift to remote. Plus added flexibility in other areas maybe balances it out?  I'm sure there is someone in the organization that hates it, no doubt there.",

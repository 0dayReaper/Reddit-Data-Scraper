    "postText": "Hey guys! We're a team of 17 who recently decided to go fully remote. So far everyone seems to be loving the flexibility and convenience, however, as the founder and CEO of the company, I'm always worrying that things might become too \"casual\" and how that can affect overall performance.\n\nThat led me down a rabbit hole of  *\"best tools for remote teams* \" type articles,  that has taken over the last couple of months. (wife wasn't too happy about this new \"hobby/obsession\")\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\n\nSo far this is what we're using for daily ops and comms. Would love to get your thoughts and recommendations!\n\n***Jira*** *- https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira*\n\n* After testing Asana, Monday.com and Trello, we decided to stay with Jira for project management.\n\n***Scribe -*** *https://cursive.io/scribe*\n\n* We use Scribe to create how-to tutorials, training new staff, contractors, etc. Really saves time.\n\n***Slack*** *-* *https://slack.com/*\n\n* Our go-to for everything from team management to daily comms.\n\n***Harvest -*** *https://www.getharvest.com/*\n\n* Personally I\u2019ve never been big on micro-management, but since we\u2019ve moved to a remote-only team environment, harvest has been great in helping us allocate time per task more efficiently. Plus I like that it integrates with Jira.\n\n***Uberconference*** *https://www.uberconference.com/*\n\n* Very similar to Zoom but we\u2019ve been using it forever.\n\n***Last Pass*** *https://www.lastpass.com/*\n\n* How we share social media and software passwords amongst the team.\n\n***GSuite***\n\n* Our go-to for general documentation, file sharing, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Goes without saying **these are not affiliate links**. Please send  recommendations my way \ud83d\ude0e",

All of the collaboration tools (many you list) just continued on as usual. We were always big on documentation via Google Docs and Confluence, so pretty seamless.\n\nThe biggest challenge we have had has actually been burn out. People are not doing a good job of disconnecting or protecting their personal time. Mandating time off each month has been a big help.",

Nothing work related ever comes up when I'm off work, unless they actually call me on my phone.\n\nIs it more environmental you mean? That the home *feels* like the office?",

Some teams have shifted hours to accomadate time zones. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Our culture is you can send email at any time, and email is de facto async, presumed that it can wait if recipient is out.\n* Slack can send message at any time. I will presume that outside of working hours its also async. We recommend configuring notifications to not alert outside of hours.\n\nI never want to prohibit sending messages, but I do want to empower everyone to put up filters/notifications to protect their down time.",

This is a stressful time and people are coming to the realization that they are going to be home for a long time, with their families, the economy is wonky, the election is wonky, the news is negative.  That wears on people and life is stressful.  Have your HR person call everyone at least 1x per week just to check in and be a trusted advisor / psychologist. Have them send care packages on a regular basis too (cupcakes, cookies, flowers, etc.).  If the employee has a significant other, send them flowers and acknowledge to them that this is a big change and might be hard and that you appreciate their support.  It's important that the company lets the team know that they are important frequently.",

We strongly suggest that during lunch, people stop working entirely and either go hang out in the \u201czoom lunch room\u201d or chill with their family.\n\nWe also used to have monthly happy hours in person that started at like 2 or 3, but since the remote era began, it\u2019s been virtual happy hours starting at 4 every Friday. It\u2019s something that peeps look forward to and honestly getting off work early is a great treat.\n\nI think there\u2019s always been a worry that people will slack off when WFH, but speaking just from the engineering department, I feel like our velocity is either the same or higher. We may just all have a drive for our mission tho, but that may a bit too optimistic.\n\nLast thing I wanna rant on is that, I think everyone mentally feels better, because they\u2019ve set up their office at home. So it went from you\u2019re always at work cause you work at home, to you\u2019re only at work, when you\u2019re in your office room / corner.\n\nGood luck, i know every team is scrambling to try and make it work!",

We are heavily using Microsoft Teams to ensure we compartmentalize data and tasks for Sales, Marketing, Legal,  etc.  We each wear many hats, so Teama help us stay focused to get things done ans also help us find the information we need.  \n\nTrello integrates with Teams to facilitate project management,  \n\nVirto calendar has bewn helpful to gives us track different calendars.  \n\nWe  are starting to play with Beekast to help with brainstorming -- if anyone has suggestions on other Apps that integrate with Microsoft Teams, i am open to suggestions.\n\nBy \"integrate,\" I mean free (no subscription) and can be linked to a channel in Microsoft Teams.",

Would highly recommend using OKRs as a philosophy to manage your goals company-wide.\n\nOKR stands for Objectives &amp; Key Results and is essentially a goals management philosophy that\u2019s companies like Google follow! In my personal experience I have seen it work beautifully in context of startups as well. The overall benefit is that your entire team will be on the same page as to what you are building\u2014even on a day to day level, and not just at a high level in the company. This level of focus, alignment and communication is essentially what started to break as teams went remote. \n\nOnce you figure the philosophy, and the practices it recommends, you can sign up for an OKR tool as well. There are tons and tons of OKR tools out there.",

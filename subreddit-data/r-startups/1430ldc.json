    "postText": "Hey all, I have this idea, which I have only spent a week thinking/writing about, and I am hopeful &amp; ambitious about having it come to life. \n\nLike many of you on this subreddit, I have general startup ideas on probably a daily basis which I keep track of, and they all generally deal with education and sometimes healthcare, since I come from both of those two backgrounds. But, again, a lot of those ideas/plans never come to life because I lose traction and motivation due to a demanding job in tech. \n\nThis EdTech platform that I hope to build aims to make education more efficient in the United States, and to offer numerous opportunities for enhancing learning experiences for not only students but teachers as well by developing a platform that has training courses on how to use the platform before implementing it to the infrastructure. \n\nWhat this platform is, is a collaborative space for students and teachers/professors. \n\nI am not sure if I can or should say more than this, as I am still new to asking for help on the internet. \n\nAll in all, I am looking for help or advice on how to move forward into making this idea into reality?\n\nThere are website builders like [Builder.ai](https://Builder.ai), or even hiring Software Engineers to help me make an MVP, but I wouldn't have the budget for an 'employee.' \n\nI am still in the very beginning stages (pen and paper), so, where do I go from here? \n\nRather than another idea fizzling, I would like to take a step forward.",

You can easily find templates for this online.\n\nEdtech is a tough space, so I would ask, what is your background? If your product is a pedagogy tool, and it doesn't have a research basis for it's efficacy, then you'll have a tough time getting any traction. If it's just something like data visualization or task automation, you may be able to succeed even with a more traditional industry approach. Making your business plan will include having to identify what types of talent and expertise you'll need to tap into.",

Generally, I don't like spending a lot of money before I have a good idea on how I'll make money (e.g. I wouldn't personally hire an engineer at this stage). I haven't used Builder, but I've had good luck with Bubble and Webflow.",

They basically had some tools which gave quizzes, did attendance, and a few other almost administrative bits. But nothing which really moved the needle when it came to replacing or seriously augmenting a human teacher.\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "I was in EdTech for a number of years and even had a startup get acquired by a big EdTech company. Here's some tips and advice:\n\n- Build it in a flowchart and then hire a designer to do it in photoshop, etc first. Even Apple Keynote is awesome to braindump the concept and how it works. It's expensive to code up things and then constantly change them. \n- With a good presentation using the above its easy to get more people onboard, synchronize vision, and raise money.\n- Edtech is def a good place to innovate in as the current stuff out there is garbage and came from massive corporations that generally don't care about usability or really anything at all. They just care about maintaining dominance and status quo, staying on top. \n- Fully understand the existing EdTech projects out there - Moodle, Desire2Learn, Blackboard, etc. Just google top 10 LMS (Learning Management Platforms). Even if these platforms don't do what your platform does many of them support plugins to do more. Consider that your product can also be a plugin to an existing platform, etc. Advantage here is that it's way easier to integrate into a college that has already integrated a specific LMS.\n- Regarding your product, understand your audience and by audience I mean not just who is using your platform but who is going to pay the bills eg. Students directly, Colleges, other Corporations. From there understand your pricing model and how you are going to keep the lights on, much less make money.\n- Getting your platform into Colleges is a super long, often multi-year process. Even if you can get your foot in the door the College will want to do a 1-year pilot with one classroom. Then there could be expanded trials or whatever else. You are at their whim. Your startup needs to have enough capital to survive for potentially years without revenue. \n- Again, it's easy to innovate, it's hard to integrate. Current EdTech companies are consistently 5-10 years behind in terms of innovation but once they get their ancient software into campuses it's hard for these Colleges to switch. This is their moat. Old, existing EdTech conglomerates are like giant, blind ogres, with lots of cash. They have employees who are strictly 9-5ers (only there for job security) so there is no room or energy for innovation. On the flipside, thats why it's easier to just sell your product to an EdTech conglomerate.\n\nOn the positive side:\n- Regarding fundraising, sometimes its easier to raise money as an EdTech, especially on the altruistic angle. Many angels will invest simply in social good. They will also refer you to others or throw fundraising dinners on your behalf, etc.\n- It's cool to be a life-long learner and to also build in the space.\n\nTo repeat, your biggest battle besides building it, is getting traction. Once you build it, you are only 50% done. It's a lot of work.\n\nI know this advice was pretty specific and may not completely apply but hopefully some of it is useful. Goodluck!\n\nEdit: Spelling",

            "comment": "My current startup is in EdTech. A few thoughts:\n- as has been stated numerous times, EdTech is a very difficult space, for many reasons. Complicated landscape (ie understanding users, buyers), long buying cycles, limited budgets, the perceived importance yet mismatched organizational prioritization. It\u2019s hard to navigate, and requires an in depth understanding of where you fit. Before taking another step in this direction, I\u2019d not only find someone to help guide you, but I\u2019d do the work in the next few bullets below\n- you absolutely should say more about your idea. You\u2019ve given essentially nothing here to provide feedback about. Ideas are cheap, execution is everything. You even said it yourself\u2014you often lose traction/motivation. Don\u2019t worry about your idea being stolen. What\u2019s more valuable for you is getting feedback on where to take it, and that\u2019s impossible without giving more info. If you share more and heed feedback, we could literally save you years of your life and tons of money\n- what is the problem you\u2019re solving, who are you solving it for, and how do you know there\u2019s a market there? Who have you talked with first hand to validate it\u2019s a legitimate problem? How much would solving that problem be worth to them? How do you know? There\u2019s a lot of discovery work you need to do here before you start solutioning. \n\nHappy to provide next step guidance if you can provide more context to the above points.",

            "comment": "As many others have said, edtech is extremely difficult. It is also rapidly changing with new laws and the government is inextricably involved. You'll have to become an approved vendor in all likelihood. Selling to public schools is incredibly difficult. You could possibly sell to private schools only, but this limits your TAM rather significantly. Selling to teachers directly or students could work, but teachers unfortunately make very little so that's a tough sell.  \n\n\nUnderstandably there isn't a lot of detail in your description, but there are lots of tools for teacher/student collaboration out there, some paid, some free.   \n\n\nStep 1 should be getting market intelligence on what the competitive landscape is with what you want. You need to have a substantial enough moat against this at least in theory before you put any of it into practice.",

Just because they are in an accelerator doesn't mean anything frankly.\n\nI work for a number of startups and small businesses and what you have to realize is that in many of these cases you are dealing directly with people who just have no idea what they are doing.  Many of these people have really bad communications and sometimes just can't be bothered with dealing with human beings.  And ya its a serious red flag when you encounter them and it can be really off putting.\n\nBy the way I have also encountered this on reddit.  I reach out to people and often times they are really bad at communication and just rude in general.  And yet they are on here asking for help.",

I pushed to hire an internal communications person since all my meetings with dev ops, HR, finance, recruitment, etc. Everyone and especially all the co-founders who all headed different departments all said different/contradicting things to their teams and was so chaotic. \n\nHaving that internal comms person that was able to get them all on the same page atleast for major decisions - it boggles my mind how communication is so ignored when it's so simple",

Just because people try to start a company doesn't mean they really have the experience to do so.  So maybe they have a basic idea and can even get a little money.  But then they need real skills to develop the product and then the inexperience starts becoming a bigger and bigger issue.\n\nAlso yc pretty much lets anybody in these days.  So the founders probably have some \"pedigree\" and some vague idea for a product.  But they completely lack any ability to execute on that product.  I have dealt with enough of these that I am now extremely cautious when i deal with people like this.  \n\nSome you can work through this.,  But as you mention sometimes its so bad that its just unworkable.\n\nWith hiring, its possible they just have some intern reading resumes and really aren't even involved in the process.",

To me the only way that this practice makes sense is if half these jobs aren\u2019t real and they are doing a super shitty practice of having people do real work for them and hoping to get new ideas or use the work themselves in the company on a super small staff. I ended up just not applying because of the way it reflects on their culture and because I knew that because of this practice, they aren\u2019t just weeding out the low tier appliers, but all of the best talent too. Top tier talent isn\u2019t going to spend several hours of free work for an application. They will just move to the next job.",

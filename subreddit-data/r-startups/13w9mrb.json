It would help shorten the supply chain between the consumers or business and suppliers and many different products such as actual livestock feed or packaging supplies. I have witnessed and experienced firsthand the difficulties of trying to find suppliers for simple material such as tape that sell in bulk and don\u2019t charge an arm and a leg and have seen colleagues have difficulty trying to sell their product for a profit because they have to compete with these huge companies that control the market and have the resources to stay in control.",

Everybody has enough tools already, and they know more tools don't solve their problem. \n\nShow them how you are different and why subscribing to you guarantees them customers.\n\nIf you can convince that you solve their problem, you get sales.",

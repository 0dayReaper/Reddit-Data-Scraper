How do I find a lawyer and trusted advisor to review offer letter and discuss general advice?\n\nAre there any other resources or other things I should consider obviously assuming I am comfortable with the business plan? I\u2019m more looking to make sure I get a fair deal for joining an early stage startup.  \n\nAppreciate any help or advise on this.   \n\nThank you",

            "comment": "What kind of offer letter is it? If it\u2019s so complicated that you need an attorney to review the letter, that would scare me. Generally offer letters are in simple enough language you don\u2019t need an attorney. \n\nIf you\u2019re talking about someone to review the equity offer, or an IP agreement, that\u2019s different. Literally just google search employment attorneys in your area and choose one. \n\nThe question i would have is what are you worried about? The attorney will not be able to tell you if the comp package is a \u201cfair deal\u201d. They can tell you maybe in general terms how it compares to what they\u2019ve seen previously, but you\u2019re the one who will have to determine if you believe it to be a fair deal. \n\nThat said, I\u2019m sure you post more details here on Reddit and you\u2019ll get some good feedback on if it\u2019s fair or not. \n\nOther things to consider:\n-\tthe founders and other team members. This is far and away *the* most important thing for you to consider. Have they done a startup before? What kind of leaders are they? Are they the kind of people you can work with, and how do you in know? You screw this one up, the comp package doesn\u2019t matter\u2014your life will be miserable regardless of how much they\u2019re paying you\n-\thow much money do they have in the bank, and how much runway at their current burn do they have? Basically you want to know if it doesn\u2019t work, how long until you need to be worried about finding another job\n-\tif you\u2019re getting equity (I\u2019d guess options) ask about the strike price, the fair market value, and total number of shares issued. Get an idea of what the equity is worth. get more info on the options themselves. They\u2019re probably vested. There\u2019s likely a cliff and an exercise window. Figure out how long the window is, and how much it\u2019s cost to exercise the options. If you leave before the exit after your options have vested, this information will become critically important\n-\twhat is their exit strategy? What\u2019s the timeline? Do you believe it? Why? You need to get a sense of when your equity will be worth something.\n\nThere are others but I\u2019d start with these ones.",

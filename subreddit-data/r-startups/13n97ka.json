But when I check my statistics nobody didn\u2019t even register. If I check the sites performs ge it\u2019s even 0 nobody just goes to my website. I\u2019m planning to start Google adds from this week, but I really thought I would had at least a registered user zny tip on getting actually people to register for my product",

Stop doing marketing efforts that rely on you knowing what you are doing.  \n\n\n* Do proper market research.\n* Conduct PERSONAL OUTREACH to your defined Target Customer Profile.\n* Run proper Product Validation tests.\n\nGo through the pinned resources in our Discord. All of them. The link is in the sidebar and about section for the sub.",

I did several surveys with profiles like me and found that the idea I had several others also had. Off course I have to say the survey came after it as I never had it as a business idea it was just for the fun. But when I started my own company I mad it to a product with the survey and then showing it to potential users what it could do.\n\nBut now the reply I get from those same people is I will look in to it, but nobody ever makes an account. I have now 2 demos planned but yeah I just can\u2019t get more people to just sign up and try it out",

Who do you think would be the people that without a doubt benefit so much from this that they would even pay just for someone to tell them that there _is_ a solution? Find them, and talk to them - not to share your product, but to understand their problems. Chances are, they don't actually benefit as much as you thought, and you will learn more about their actual problems.\nAlso, read \"The Mom Test\".",

Meaning, the market is not understanding what you are selling or not seeing the value in what you are selling. Paid ads will not solve that problem for you, they will just drain money from your business.\n\nI would recommend setting up quick calls with your friends to hear there thoughts on the product and also understand their user experience to find out why they are not converting. Then, you can take a step further and interview non-friends in the market.",

    "postText": "After 8 years of being an entrepreneur in marketing and tech i discovered that 90% of all startups fail not because they dont have a product but because no one gives a sh*t.\n\nAnd while most wantrepreneurs still think their top secret heity teity business idea is worth a billion dollars customers know better. And guess what: your tinder for X isnt even close of being worth realising and no, you wont become the next mark zuckerberg just by pretending to be a tech talent because you once made a wordpress website for your friends moving business.\n\nAnd even when you are one of the few highly talented coding kids who managed to understand complex algorithms before having your first kiss - business is not about writing the most beautiful code, but about understanding your target audience and to be more precise, their needs! So dont even consider typing a single line in your pumped up IDE or setting up a new repository on github before understanding this thing and one thing only:\n\nYou first get to know your customers and then build a product! \n\nAnd while this might sound easy as cake I can hear your brain rattling even though this is a post! \n\nInstead of wasting your precious time on doing things no one needs, hiring top designers to make you a barely pleasant logo for an arm and a leg and dreaming about success you should start thinking about the deepest needs of your target audience.\n\nFirst sell your product, then build it!\n\nEdit: thank you folks for the overwhelming appreciation. I hope you have a nice Christmas and iterate soon on your products :)",

There's still definitely assumptions we've made that are overfit to our early customers and not representative of everyone, but the product itself isn't a fundamental mis-fit.",

Offer up a mini workshop for $23.88 ( this can be a reordered webinar) where you visually help them better understand what this change looks like and map ( construct) out what will happen along the progress path.

At each step ( and exchange of increased cash / value add  \ud83d\udc46) you deliver on customer happiness, they will come back and say.. For $8 s/he helped me with X or better understand Y, I wonder how much more they could help me for $24, and then up it goes to a seminar or one on one\n\n*note / this can also work for SaaS as you are helping the customer become a better version of themselves thru solving problems they are having at work or in life.\n\nI've been lucky to learn while building a startup from a napkin business model over coffee with client who became partner, to 7 figure acquisition. I've also wasted my own $ ( family / friends also) 250k building out something that I fell in love with where I sold the technology and not what solution it could solve to business problems they were experiencing in the now. Trust me.. No one cares about streaming rates or. AI.. They care about how product / service XYZ Can help them make progress ( make them money / save them money \ud83d\udcb5 / make them look good) those are the only 3 things 95% of business first world problems they care about. \n\nHoping theirs a mini gem \ud83d\udc8eof insight  in here for someone :) \n\n#goodluckBuilding",

In a new and booming industry, I spent most of my time collecting leads, configuring CRM, designing the website and marketing materials, fine tuning the branding, vetting numerous vendors, etc. I ended up having best product on the market but by the time that happened, my competitor captured the market by selling a below-average product with shitty branding. They got the exposure early and their brand took off. The thought that everything must be in order before selling is a self-limiting and crippling belief. While I wish I succeeded, this was a very valuable lesson for me.\n\nGet the fuck out there and sell!!!! It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a service or product. You can pre-sell anything to generate the cash up front.",

Below are a few things I find to be extremely beneficial - what else works for you?  \n\nTLDR\n1. Understand and Know Your Target Persona \n2. Narrow Down a List to ~25 Accounts\n3. Identify 5/10 Leads w/in the Target Accounts\n4. Run Multichannel Outreach Cadences (2+ Months)\n5. Personalize Outreach\n\n1/ Understand and Know your Target Customer Persona\n\nExample: I am looking for companies who are making headlines for going above and beyond for their employees AND are primarily hybrid/ WFH \n\n10 minutes on Google and I have a list of 50+ possible targets\n\n2/ Narrow Down your List to 20/25 accounts. \n\nUse various criteria to narrow that target list down to ~25 accounts. \n\nExample: As a startup, I know I wanted to focus on accounts that were between 100-300 users AND are native tech \n\nSpend an hour on LinkedIn doing your HW\n\n3/ Identify 5-10 Leads w/in the 25 Accounts\n\nIt\u2019s critically important to focus on going deep when selling to Enterprises. \n\nExample: im building an employee well-being software. Our buyers are HR departments.  I am targeted 5-10 people with related titles that may be able to serve as our champion. \n\nUse LinkedIn to search &amp; filter\n\n4/ Run Outreach Cadences on the ~125 Leads for a Few Months\n\nCold outreach cadences typically convert around the 12+ touch. In other words, you need to touch them 12+ times before they will potential sit down for a meeting. Those touches can (and should be) be from various sources such as LinkedIn, phone call, Twitter, email, Ads, etc. you need to be extremely persistent it is the \ud83d\udd11. I\u2019d recommend running a 15 touch campaign over a 60 day period all around educating the prospects.\n\nExample: I built an outreach cadence that consists of 15 touches over ~45 days that consists of Email, LinkedIn, Twitter, Phone Call, Ads.\n\n5/ Personalize Outreach\n\nIt goes without saying, Personalize your touches as much as possible. \n\nExample: I found a ton of recent articles calling out companies &amp; Individuals that I will reference. I will research and try to understand and align with their company goals. \n\nDo DD - Google for any recent headlines you may see on the person/ company.\n\nNote: \nIf a Company/ Lead is no longer viable - interchange the company with another on your Target list. \n\nYou do not need to be married to it however you MUST be consistent.\n\nAdditional tidbits:\nWe offer demos and free risk assessments where we upload our software in your system to really show you the value before we close the business.\n\nIf you don\u2019t already do this or have  live product demo you can test in their environment, I\u2019d highly recommend creating one.\n\nHope you find this helpful.",

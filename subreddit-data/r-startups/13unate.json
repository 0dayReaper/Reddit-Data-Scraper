    "postText": "I have an Android Application that is getting hugely popular these days. Over the past two months, it has had around 100k organic downloads (around 60% retention rate). I have to add new location based features and additional functionality to increase retention rate/downloads. I will definitely need some help like getting new developers on board, running promotions, managing social media pages, etc. I would really appreciate some suggestions on the next steps to help grow this app. My limitations: I am on non-immigrant visa. Although the app has ads, I haven\u2019t withdrawn the revenue yet, because I cannot have other sources of income besides my current employment. I am based in Texas right now.",

Ask them to rate the app 1-5 or 1-10 and then what's the one thing you should do to make the app go from x to x+0.5.\n\nAs for marketing, strategize on building a brand voice based off of your customer profiles. \n\nRun a tik tok, instagram, Twitter, Substack, Medium, website. Post on all of them consistently. Spend some time making really good content for the Medium for example and repurpose that on the other platforms. \n\nFollow a bunch of relevant people on all of the accounts and get active in those communities.",

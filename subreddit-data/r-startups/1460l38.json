    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nWould love to get some perspective on a startup problem that i ran into. \n\nBackground: \n\n\\- i started a startup couple of years ago with an angel investor who invested the first $50k for 20% into the startup when i was just a uni freshman with only a prototype and couple of hundreds in revenue. \n\n\\- this 1st startup didn't work out, but i pivoted to another idea and wanted to start a new company for it. \n\n\\- Because angel investor A invested in my 1st startup Out of gratitude, i decided to give him the same shares percentage for this 2nd company without any capital injection while he also helped to raised a 100k for this new idea from another investor. He got a commission for the raise. \n\n\\- Startup 2 didn't work out either. All these while, i also paid this investor an \"advisory fee\" monthly out of gratitude despite him not doing much throughout the whole process.\n\n\\- after the 2nd startup also failed. Out of goodwill, i paid back all the investors their principal back out of my own pocket. For this 1st investor who has supported me from the start, i also forked out an additional $20k to compensate him for his time. \n\n\\- all in all, while the startup didn't make much money, this investor is estimated to have a return of 2x over 7 years of his principal. \n\n\\- when i want to shut down the 2nd startup, and start my 3rd idea. I realized that he is a bad fit, and doesn't have the skills or knowledge to properly advise a startup after growing myself further over the years. I decided to not let him join the 3rd startup. \n\n\\- The 3rd startup is very promising and we became profitable in just 4 months. \n\n\\- He then went on to his network, and mutual networks of mine, and lament that i am an ungrateful asshole who forgot how much he has helped me from the start, and all the energy that he has spent to \"groom\" me into who i am today, and just when i am becoming successful, i have \"ditched\" him, harming my reputation in the business community when he himself agreed and signed all the paperworks.  \n\n\\--------\n\nI just want to ask, is this normal? did i do something wrong? How can i best approach this problem when there is a man running around defaming my reputation as an ungrateful bastard.",

            "comment": "You didn't treat him like an investor and instead treated him like a friend. You don't give investors shares in a second startup \"for free\", you don't pay investors a commission on bringing in more investors, you don't pay investors advisor fees and you don't pay back investors from a failed startup with your personal funds. You \"grew\" a friend and now he's acting like a hurt, betrayed friend. Best solution is to just tell everyone what you did and own up to your mistakes.",

Another option is, if you know some of the people he\u2019s aired grievances to, you could try to reach out to a couple of the most influential and see if you could meet to get their advice and perspective on how to navigate the situation while sharing your side of the story. Honestly it\u2019s a bad look on his end, and i do wonder how much impact his bad mouthing is actually having on your reputation. It could be less than you are perceiving it to be. Other option is to just ignore it, build a great business and most business people will over look the sour grapes detractor on the sidelines.",

If it's the latter, his behavior is even more ridiculous, because then he's not actually upset you \"ditched\" him, he's just upset that he is missing out on potential profit.",

I\u2019d have a chat with him that basically says, \u201cI\u2019m not sure why you are defaming me to others, as I returned your capital with interest, something I didn\u2019t have to do because it was risk investments. What do you think I owe you and why?\u201d\n\nLet him vent and realize he has no claim. If he persists, a nice letter from your attorney will help.",

They know the risk. If the company goes to 0, it goes to zero and your new company is a fresh entity with a refreshed cap table. \n\nYou also don't need to pay back investors with your own money. That's the game of startup VC. They know the odds and they only need 1 company to hit it out of the park to make their fund a home run. \n\nAt this point it's best to just move on. In a few months he won't remember and also he shouldn't be bad mouthing people in public. That just makes him look bad, plus VCs and investors are not as loyal to each other as you think. If you are a hot startup, they're still going to want to invest in you.",

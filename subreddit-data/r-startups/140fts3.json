    "postText": "I keep reading about market research, and product validation before building the product. It sort of makes sense for a B2C product, but what about B2B?\n\nIt has never made any logical sense to me. Everyone can have an opinion, but the more relevant a person is, the more valuable their time is. \n\nStart with market research, surveys. I cannot imagine the scenario where - let\u2019s say my product\u2019s target audience is large e-commerce businesses - relevant people like product managers are spending their time doing surveys for a product that doesn\u2019t exist yet, and they don\u2019t benefit from it.\n\nSecond one is reaching out directly to ask \u201cwould you use this product\u201d. I believe they keep being spammed by these questions, and I find it hard to believe they respond to every one of them. I keep being spammed on LinkedIn by many people offering all sorts of services with clearly template messages. In the beginning I was sort of curious, and checked their profiles, their companies, but it didn\u2019t reach the risk-reward ratio level where it was worth it to get into a conversation. \n\nI\u2019m struggling to understand this startup way of thinking, but I clearly wasn\u2019t successful with \u201cmy way\u201d of just building the product, and waiting for the customers to come - it didn\u2019t work. \n\nNowadays businesses are choking from \u201csolutions\u201d, even reputable ones. How are they caring about products that haven\u2019t even been built? \n\nAnother one is \u201cIf the problem is large enough, they will pay for the worst implementation as well\u201d. I can only imagine this being the case for completely new markets with no competitors. But as far as I read \u201cno competitors is a bad sign\u201d.\n\nTo summarise, I want to know how to reach out to relevant people in B2B where the target audience is large businesses, and make it worth it for them to spend time for my solution?",

            "comment": "There are many ways to do this. I personally have done the following - which has helped me validat problem, solution and onboard the first couple of pilots and later customers.\n\n1. Define your ICP.\n2. Reach out to about 100 people and ask for a interview about the problem they experience as ICP. Dont sell. These customer interviews are to validate that the problem (your companies hypothesis) is true and a high priority. Companies pay for high priority problems to be solved.\n3. Follow up meeting with the ones who you validated had the problem and where it was a high priority. Go for the early adopters who are okay with a half baked problem because its a \u201chair on fire\u201d problem. Validate your solution is the right fit. Mock ups is fine. Propose a paid pilot or go dirextly for pre-paid sign up if they express they want to buy it asap (this happens once you go through the process of qualifying). Usually, asking for pilots with an end date and agreement to pay if they are happy is something most agree to.\n\nAll of this is easier said than done. But it works. I am happy to share a more in depth guide if you find this approach helpful.",

I\u2019m not suggesting you should ask your customers which solution they want.\n\nI\u2019m suggesting you validate that the problem exist and is a high priority to solve. Problems that are high priority are more likely to get money thrown at them. Sometimes, that also includes asking great questions to help prospects discover they have a problem and how big it is (like you mentioned before). Only afterwards should you validate the solution you came up with.\n\nI agree its difficult to get people to adopt new products. However, if you follow the process I shared you can end up with a handful of customers who had the problem and needs to solve it with high priority. Those customers are usually early adopters and open to trying new things to solve a \u201chair on fire\u201d problem.",

Both would have paid $250 if they were 25 customers later; they got huge (and permanent; don't screw people that trusted you) discounts for going first.\n\nIf you are hitting a highly urgent pain point, they will be willing to help.  From their pov, they get multiple years of dev team output for saas prices.  $25k isn't even the fully-loaded cost of one month of eng time from their internal teams once you include PM time and ongoing ops and maintenance.  So it's a bargain.\n\nAgain, if you are attempting to fix something that is urgent for them.",

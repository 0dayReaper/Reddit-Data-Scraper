    "postText": "Hey everyone, would love to get some feedback, insights, and thoughts on a sales commission structure I\u2019m building out. I own a development firm where we do development (application, mobile, web), digital marketing, and business management consulting. I\u2019m looking to develop and onboard a sales/business development team shortly. Trying to work out a structure that can be lucrative for the team but also allows us to keep margins to reinvest into further growth and human capital.\n\nAppreciate you all!\n\nCommission structure is tiered per sale/job\t\t\n\nCommission rate are cumulative. As Example a Sales Rep sales a contract valued at 1 M. The Rep would earn 6% commission on the portion up to 275000, 8% on the portion between 275 and 425, 10% on the portion between 425 and 1M\t\t\n\nCommission is capped at 2M for contract value. Contracts with values over 2M are bonused 50K if the final contract value is over 5% of the set price.\t\t\n\nFor FIXED tier, jobs below 29,999 are paid a flat fee for each sale.\n\nCompensation warning example on percentage commission for 1M contract.\nProjected Sale Value\t\t$1,000,000\t\nTotal Compensation\t\t$136,000\t\n\nTier #1\t\nCommission %\t6.00%\nCaps at\t$275,000\nMax. Commission\t$16,500\nEligible For\t$16,500\nEarned Commission\t\n\nTier #2\t\nCommission %\t8.00%\nCaps at\t$425,000\nMax. Commission\t$12,000\nEligible For\t$12,000\nEarned Commission\t$12,000\n\nTier #3\t\nCommission %\t10.00%\nCaps at\t$1,250,000\nMax. Commission\t$82,500\nEligible For\t$57,500\nEarned Commission\t$57,500\n\t\n\nTier #4\t\t\nCommission %\t5.00%\t\nCaps at\t$2,000,000\t\nMax. Commission\t$37,500\t\nEligible For\t-$12,500\t\nEarned Commission\t$0\t\n\nFIXED\n\nTier #1\t\t\nJob Value\t$1,499\t\nMax. Commission\t$100\t\n\nTier #2\t\t\nJob Value\t$1,500\t$4,999\nMax. Commission\t$225\t\n\nTier #3\t\t\nJob Value\t$5,000\t$9,999\nMax. Commission\t$375\t\n\nTier #4\t\t\nJob Value\t$10,000\t$14,999\nMax. Commission\t$500\t\n\nTier #5\t\t\nJob Value\t$15,000\t$29,999\nMax. Commission\t$1,250",

                            "comment": "Definitely recommend a base. For some comparison, I\u2019m in custom software sales at a scale up and my base is in the six figures. I took six months to sell my first deal, and I\u2019m a president\u2019s club rep with about 7 years selling. I found this learning curve to be intense and I\u2019ve been in tech sales most of my career - I wouldn\u2019t have been able to learn enough to sell effectively part time. YMMV, especially with reps possibly being able to lean on marketing and business management sales.\n\nI have friends who sell commission only, but they\u2019re hard to find and harder to manage, and typically sell for more than one company at once. Even building a business development team, you\u2019re going to want to have experienced people if you don\u2019t have established processes and expect them to self-manage.\n\nBut, this commission structure seems lucrative - mine is a flat % on a 2 million quota and no accelerators. If you can find someone who\u2019s the right fit for this on a commission only basis, this wouldn\u2019t be a bad offer in my opinion.\n\nMaybe try both and see what sticks, or offer a draw? Personally at the level I\u2019m at, I wouldn\u2019t even look at a no base role - I have to build processes, integrate multiple teams, and be responsible for the full sales cycle. I started at a commission only role, though, and ended up ok!",

I really appreciate the feedback! \n\nI would have no qualms offering a base+ commission however where I\u2019m at with the business journey it would not be feasible. That being said as I continue to build the business and get the pipeline growing, there will come the point that supporting base salary is 100% feasible. As it stands the risk I would expose the business too at the moment is not quite worth it. \n\nDefinitely agree, managing a pure only commission sales team is difficult and as we grow it is 100% necessary to build a team around individuals that are salary based and in turn more likely to remain.\n\nAny additional thoughts comments or resources you think would be great to review are appreciated!",

Currently I am the one going through the full sales cycle including lead gen, cold calls, and contract negotiation and requirements. \n\nThe associate would be given the tools to continue lead gen, support on sales calls, and access to the technical team for requirements gathering and associated pricing feasibility understanding. \n\nOn average a contract takes 38 days to close from less to sale.\n\nI would have an expectation that the right person would have the capability to build a book of business. Additionally I would also be more the. Happy to compensate and pay a base of the person would be undertaking activit\u00e9s that improve business and sales processes for the business.

                            "comment": "So many other factors needed to create a truly informed perspective here. For context, I was the head of customer and technical sales at Spiff, a leading commission automation company. In my tenure, we grew sales by 650%, and I\u2019ve had the chance to see a lot of commission plans. \n\nI have some thoughts, but a few more questions for your personal reflection:\n\n- what margins does your business need to operate? This is the first question you need to answer so you can have an idea of what kinds of commissions you can afford to give your sales people. \n- why make it so complicated? I\u2019m not sure I get the difference in fixed v other commission structure, but it seems like if you really do need to drive different incentives for different AVCs, you should hire different people to handle different deal sizes instead of trying to make a \u201cone-size-fits-all sales plan\u201d\n- why make it purely commission structure instead of providing a base? You will likely struggle to get the dedicated sales people in this structure, particularly if you don\u2019t have success stories of other reps you can point to. It makes it feel more like a direct-to-consumer sales model\u2014like selling pest control door to door. In that scenario, it\u2019s 100% commission based, but all the reps know they can sell it because tons of other reps have done it with exceedingly high degrees of success. You have no track record to point to (outside yourself, which doesn\u2019t suggest repeatability) so it will be hard to find good reps who will take your plan on\u2014particularly since it takes time to build a book of business. \n- why cap the commissions on contract sizes? ESPECIALLY, if you\u2019re wanting people to go pure commission, then you need to incentivize the hell out of them just knocking it out of the park. You don\u2019t want a weak commission OTE if they\u2019re doing it for relative peanuts to what they could bring in elsewhere with a guaranteed base. This is why D2C sales reps kill it, because not only is there no cap, but there are perpetual accelerators the higher they get\n- Are you settings quotas? They\u2019re not super useful if you don\u2019t have a base, but the question you\u2019ll want to consider is how often you pay out commissions, what milestones must be met, how long a rep remains eligible for commissions with contracts that come in, and when you weigh these things in, the timeframe over which it is measured becomes super important and relevant.\n- what size deals do you WANT your reps to bring in? Because with this structure, I\u2019m going to default to whatever is the easiest for me to reliably close, since I\u2019m not getting a base, I need easy. It also takes a very different skill set to close a $10k deal than a $1mm deal. \n- where do your leads come from? Are they largely inbound? Referral based? Or are they outbound? The type of motion changes incentives and commission structure as well. Hunting v farming takes different skills. \n\nMy suggestion? Figure out what you want your target deal size to be, and what margins you need to make. \n\nThen keep it simple. Pay a base. Don\u2019t make it too complicated until you need to. I wouldn\u2019t worry about paying them too much to start with, you can always make changes later if it\u2019s not working for the business. You\u2019ll never be sad to get too many new customers. \n\nGood luck!",

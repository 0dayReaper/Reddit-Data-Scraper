Softbank, especially,  made WeWork too big to fail and their Vision Fund led to unrealistic valuations that had to be improved each subsequent round. \n\nThe FOMO also led to crazy multiples and things like WeWork making up their own accounting terms (Community-adjusted EBITDA). \n\nThey were a property company with tech valuations. Good that the markets balked at their IPO\n\nThere will be a business case(s) on the reckless corporate governance of the VC models and their sucking up to founders over basic financial principles.",

He took the money investors gave him to *grow the startup* and used it to buy the buildings, then profited off of the rent from the startup.",

I find it unethical to start a company and go get investors who trust that I am doing right by their money and then do all kinds of things to line my own pockets and not give 2 fucks about the investors, employees and the members; all of whom got fucked over by this guy. I don\u2019t think you should do backdoor deals to go looking to buy up property to then rent it back to the company. He wasn\u2019t doing that before he started WeWork. He started doing that after he took millions of other peoples money. He has a fiduciary duty to financial improve the company that he is working for, not back door money into his own pocket. It is so far off from what people trusted he would be doing with their money. Then, as OP states, he decides to change the name of the company from WeWork to The We Company. He charges the company $3 million because he then decided to trademark the name We company - he is a con artist.",

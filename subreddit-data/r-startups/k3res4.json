    "postText": "Hey Guys,\n\nAs we all know, studying our competition is necessary, and one of the most important things to study is their ad strategy.\nYou can understand a lot about their messaging, creative and funnel strategy when you look at their ads.\n\nHere's a simple way to understand what your competition is doing in terms of their ad strategy:-\n\n- Google \"Facebook Ads Library\".\n- Write your competitor's page name.\n- Look at their ads, and scroll to the bottom.\n- If an ad is running for a month, or more, chances are that they are getting good conversions from it.\n- So study their copy, their creatives, click on the ad, and see what their funnel is, what their landing page looks like, what action it wants you to take, what mail you get when you do that action, etc.\n\nThis will help you learn from them, get creative ideas, and actually do things better than what they are doing.\n\nI've done this for multiple businesses, across various industries, and this always saves me money (and time) to test things, especially in the initial stages.",

They give 50 or 100 free lookups a month but what's really cool is they show the directory of top emails for each website for free.\n\nHuge help until you can afford something more thorough. Came in clutch for me the last couple weeks.",

Snov has a sale rn too (I promise I\u2019m not shilling lol). Hunter is 2x more expensive and doesn't have that directory feature. I would keep hunter's free trial 50 contact trial though as a backup if you're bootstrapping it. \n\nBut the point of my post wasn\u2019t price per se it\u2019s that if u go to like Salesforce.com and open Snov it\u2019ll show you corporate emails for free no credit needed which you can cross reference. No need to open LinkedIn. I\u2019m not sure if charges you for the full directory (there\u2019s a button to show more) but for my purposes the free list of 10 is usually enough. \n\nAlso Snov is the most free lookups too. And 10x more credits for same price as rocketreach which is the priciest",

Instead of reverse engineering your competitors' thought pattern in a futile attempt to smash-and-grab, you ought to be spending every drop of that energy in speaking to your own customers/users.\n\nMake decisions off that data and you make a genuine step ahead instead of stealing a reactionary slice of pie.\n\nBuild the product/service that fits your users like a glove, and forget about competition.

To study your competitor gives you a holistic view of trends and what everyone\u2019s doing. However, that often creates a drag and push u do things because of FOMO. \n\nYou need to be able to stand against the urge not to build what they have and be okay with your lacking some of competitors features.

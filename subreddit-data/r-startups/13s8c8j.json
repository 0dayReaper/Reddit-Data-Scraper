Either split out the agency services into independent businesses, or consolidate features into streamlined product services.\n\nThe way you describe it feels like a country general store. I don't doubt you're good at FBA and sourcing, but this hodgepodge feels absurd. App dev has little to do with non-app webdev, 3d modelling, amazon fba.",

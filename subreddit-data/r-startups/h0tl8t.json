    "postText": "What I'm about to tell you comes from painful experience, I've managed to bumble my way just about staying on top of the lessons and eventually becoming successful but it was definitely the hard way. The thing is that it seems almost everybody gets it wrong, no matter how many successful people, books, etc. tell them they should think about it differently. When I meet the guys that have managed to go 0 to 30 mil ARR in 9 months inevitably they did it the way that is recommended. \n\nThe simplest version of it is that almost everybody who wants to create a startup thinks of a product and tries to create an MVP as the first thing and then we're wedded to our sunk cost. Creating a product before starting to sell is generally a huge mistake. I'm a techie, so this took a long time to really sink in surely I needed something to demo or that they could see but I was wrong. \n\nYou don't actually need a product to sell it. We make an AI platform this was exactly the thing where we made product that solved a problem but there was no market yet so it was really painful for the first few years. Luckily AI hype got us funding. I'd previously made other products that just didn't sell at all and didn't have the hype to land funding with no sales. \n\nNow we're looking for the best trojan horse solution to build on our platform that gets solves a pressing need but gets them on our platform. We brainstormed ideas, target markets and roles and then the first thing we did was try to sell it. Create cohorts of target customers, measure response rates, engagement, actually run through the sales cycle. Now we've closed our first sale and we haven't even started to make the product yet. They don't pay unless we deliver but they want it so badly they're prepared to close the deal before we've even started making it. We also know that lots of other people in market love it. By this point what we're going to build has also evolved a lot from our initial brainstorms, by not having built something we said hey guys we think you have this problem is this a big problem for you? We were thinking this would be a great solution would that work for you? We're going to charge X and this is the business case does that make sense, would you pay it? As we got feedback we were able to rapidly evolve the proposition in a way you just can't when you've already built something.\n\nStart with selling, not building. You don't need an MVP.\n\nI've heard great stories about people operating a personal shopping \"SaaS platform\" where they started providing the service in person for what they planned to charge online, operated the whole thing from spreadsheets and then got funding and built the website.\n\nFunding is so much easier this way around as well. You take this approach and you say we sold to this many people at this cost, if we get funding we can increase operational efficiency like this scale sales like this and we'll make this new number. That is a million times easier than look at my cool product can I please have money so I can sell it. The challenge is that selling even great products is hard and a completely different skill to making a product, so there is a much higher failure rate in these types of investments. If you go product first and you don't have 10 B2B customers and a million in recurring revenue or 10k B2C users getting VC investment is hard.\n\nI have a friend that started product first, failed to get early traction, went through angel round after angel round. Finally got traction, got VC money, grew the business, got Sequoia to back them but if they sold now despite the company being worth 100 million he'd only get 3 million because he's been diluted so much through the angel rounds.\n\nThe guys who start sales first still own the vast majority of their business. I met one guy that made 3 billion and never needed funding because his sales growth was so strong.\n\nAgain, take it from a guy that took a long time to see the light, sell first, then build",

Than help I've sold this but I don't know how to deliver it.\n\nI saw 3 posts today from people having built things that weren't selling. Hence thinking this was worth writing.\n\nI have some friends that are non tech that I've helped find good tech cofounders / employees but I generally see this approach from my friends that set up a service based business, have been successful, saw a need for some tech and now are trying to build it out. Of my friends that sold first and built later, all of them have had various levels of success. There's certainly challenges in being a non tech founder of a tech company, same for being a non sales founder of a tech company but the sales first people tend to fail early or succeed reasonably well, whereas the tech guys generally go through wars. My personal circles these days generally have a big success bias but I see more sales lead succeses there, probably 80% vs people talking about startups on places like this sub it seems like at leat 80% are making products. Also of the successes most tech people own less of their company and had a harder journey to being successful.",

Designing the architecture behind the systems I create and figuring out if they affect any of the other systems I've already got in place saves me a huge amount of time in the long run.\n\nI've just simply applied this logic to everything and so now it makes it easier for me to plan before building the business just like I plan before writing one line of code!\n\nHopefully that's of some use to you :)",

Talk to your potential customers. As a marketing guy, I\u2019m a passive-aggressive salesperson (I want you to buy, I just want it to be your idea). So I\u2019ll admit - I HATE the getting out of the building phase, probably as much as most engineers. \n\nBut god, it\u2019s so important. The sunk cost fallacy is real. (And so is dilution). At the bare minimum, you save a lot of wasted time, and can get a successful product to market faster by doing some selling than you can by building the wrong app, pivoting, and starting over. Customer-centered product development is just a better way, period. \n\nIsn\u2019t that what a business is for? To help customers? To solve problems that someone will pay to have solved? Then why not figure out/validate the real problems ahead of time?",

The answer is always different depending on the idea.\n\nWhat's the minimal step you can take to validate your hypothesis?\n\nThe lean startup is a whole book on this and is great.\n\nOne from my personal experience was being the competitive person that I am, I thought a vs site where it showed 2 video clips side by side of people doing a skating trick or a dunk or whatever and people voted for the best clip. It works a bit like hot or not back in the day and you can filter on area of interest, etc. and then it figured out the global rank, so you could see monthly best, best all time, etc. I thought it would be cool but you need to find a niche to start from and grow into the general thing. I came up with the idea that reddit communities might be a good way to find passionate people, so to try and find the niche by engaging users, posting on the subs. Turns out that not many people were really excited about about the idea. There were positive replies but nobody that was like \"let me know when you make this me and my friends will be straight on it\". A couple of nights of reddit and I was convinced that it would be a real struggle to get people to post stuff. So I left it.\n\nTalk to the people you think will buy buy / use it. If you don't get a super positive reaction leave it. People will say nice things to be nice, if you want an idea that works, you need people to light up. Like my most recent product we've just sold before it's even made. When we explain the product we get some insanely positive, like \"OMG I actually tried to make this, this is exactly what I need\" . \"This would be amazing, I'll sign up right now\"",

They thought sending 15 emails was attempting to sell. \n\nSo I'll include the bit on cold B2B at the end but the main point is expect selling your product / engaging your users to be more work than building the product. In person is always the easiest sell, where can you find your customers in the real world? Get some on board as early adopters. \n\nAre there subreddits in your niche can you respectfully ask specific people to try your product based on their post history that shows they should actually benefit a lot from your product. I only suggest this because half the world is on lockdown face to face is way better than online engagement.  We used meet ups where we offered training in how to solve problem X with our tool to get cohorts of user testers. \n\nIf you do this listen, not to the features they ask for but to the problems they've identified with your solution. We had a lot of people that gave feedback about the user journey being confusing and needing to redesign it completely. We added more descriptive text and suddenly UI feedback went from a weakness to a strength. \n\nAnyway if you're struggling with cold selling here was my advice to that dude that sent 15 emails and thought he'd tried selling:\n\nMy product made over a million in revenues last year, up 300% from the year before and we have a 2.6% response rate to our BEST email.\n\nYou need to be testing email effectiveness on cohorts of around 500 potential customers to start with. With each cohort refine your strategy, look at what works best.\n\nOut of the replies we then only close 3%. So effectively we now send 1,282 people emails per sale and that's after optimising the messaging role targeting, etc.\n\nThe bad news is selling is generally hard. Especially from cold emails. i was a dev that really underestimated the complexity of sales. I've now learnt the hard way. \n\nThe easier sales come from your network, if you don't have one you can create one. Who is the best connected influencer in your customers market space? Move the earth to connect with them ie: whatever it takes, fly to an event they'll be at, etc. Offer them 50% of your business if they can help you grow and equity starts to vest as they hit certain growth milestones. \n\nIf you build it they do not come. Hustle, and if you're not a natural hustler team up with someone who is",

I've never heard a first hand encounter story in industry of vapourware startups. I chat with 38 VCs that like our product and might invest in our next round regularly. When these vapourware stories come out they're just as surprised as anyone that investors ignored the standard validation criteria by so much. They all flex the criteria a little bit when they like something but how those things get funded is as much a mystery to professional investors as us. \n\nWe're not telling people we have a product yet, we're making sure we have enough buyin that if we can build the product we know we'll hit the ground running in terms of revenues. This is more common than you might think. \n\nMy AI platform that 4 people built working full time with almost no market validation (I thought I did but I didn't really) took just over a year to make an MVP. The tricky word viable. We had a prototype within a month but the first thing that people would actually commit to a sale on after a  demo / hands on took a year. I had to make very hard financial decisions as I never thought it would take that long and luckily all the gambles paid off. \n\nIf we'd have gone sell first we could have worked from something people wanted to buy even in a rough state and would pay for and have had revenues very quickly. This IMO would have been the right way. \n\nYou say that if can build it in a month we don't know what we're doing but the challenge was that people didn't realise how useful that early tool was. Now that it's got all the bells and whistles and people know more about AI it's a much easier sell. After having committed to building this it always seemed like it would be less work to turn it into something they would buy than to try and do something else. In hindsight it was almost always wrong. \n\nAnyway you can be disgusted that we've started selling first and iterating with customers at the design stage, not locking ourselves into a months build for a prototype of each possible version and I'll wish you the best of luck. \n\nJust ask yourself this if you could go through 12 design iterations of your product in 12 meetings in 12 days vs doing 12 different 1 month prototypes, is that a good use of time?",

We made a solution that was too broad a vision too big. We started so early but the competition that just automated one type of solution well. Didn't have any of the complex technology that underpins our general solution well they made a lot more money than us faster than us. In hindsight we could have easily done what they did biting off a smaller slice of the pie and had more money to race the other competitors. If you're early you might know you had any yet but if what you're building is really valuable, you have them trust me. Luckily building the tech is hard and we were early, so as some have struggled to generalise we've caught up with our competitors for the most part, one company did the first part right and did an OK job of the second part but because of their revenues they got a lot of investment, now they buy companies that can do things their platform can't and I'm worried might be creating a very large competitive moat.\n\nAnyway I'm sure you'll do what you're doing but maybe I can help convince you to take a look at who would be the companies that would adopt your technology and is there a smaller stepping stone that would give them value, that could pay you money for your big idea.

We are discussing the point of having an MVP before you start asking people to invest in your idea. Since you are from the AI domain, let me propose that my protocol can get you purest form of data from all the sensors/ customer data connected to my network in realtime. Along with proofs, which you can verify the authenticity, and this enables AI engineers to build models that can do online training at much cheaper rates, and also, all the preprocessing by blockchain.   \nWill you invest in me if I just say this, or will you be more comfortable if I show you a working prototype of how your AI model fits into our system? \n\n  \nIn my protocol, the idea of interoperability is to provide a generic interface to read and write to the blockchain with anything that is outside the protocol's direct control. This interface allows any user to create applications that can utilize this to talk between applications and take advantage of the computing the protocol provides like smart contracts etc.\n\n  \n Another example:  Interoperability with Bitcoin, Ethereum, IPFS,  this allows you to store massive datasets collected by sources -&gt; manipulated by smart contracts -&gt; processed by your AI model (outside my protocol ) -&gt; do a payment in Bitcoin/ Ethereum based on AI model result -&gt; store the results in IPFS, this is possible in my protocol as it supports these natively. You, as a developer, can extend this interoperability depending on your use case.\n\nKeeping aside my protocol, Of course, maintaining startups lean is always good. We cannot strictly say that \"Selling First, Building Second\" is correct. It depends. It's about creating an MVP we cannot call it an MVP if it has (7 figures expense) and more than 3.5 years. That's more of a product. MVP should be simple and something our team can build in 2-3 months (depending on your idea) and affordable cost. If that is appreciable by the audience, then you have cracked it. Anyway, Good luck to you",

You're also iterating and doing lots of operations that work on understanding the data so we're internally always going to use unencrypted data. Though we have robust security that means that we're trusted by major banks and medical firms to store their data as it is. \n\nWe don't need proof of data origin because generally it all comes from the one company that's uploading the data. \n\nWith overly security conscious firms they don't put data on the cloud. I have seen one use block chain tech but it's always stored internally, not using any public block chains. This is extremely rare though because once you're inside their network it's generally deemed pretty secure. So for these firms we put our platform inside their network. \n\n The main cost of AI is compute and adding extra encryption steps to the access and operation of data will make it more expensive, not less.\n\nIf you're talking about distributed work. We already do that and without the encryption steps. \n\nFrom what I've heard I don't see value. If you tried to market to me I would not engage. You would never get to demo me your product even if it worked. \n\nI'm not trying to be overly mean, like I said we've been approached by block chain firms and just given how industry uses data, we've never really seen any value to the point that I don't engage with block chain tech vendors unless it's as a favour and then I politely decline. You will probably meet the same fatigue if you try to sell to AI companies. Especially as your pitch is quite vague, at least I didn't actually see any value for me from what you wrote. Hopefully I've given enough insight to say why. \n\nMedical and banking are probably the most security conscious industries, given how they work can you give a concrete example a solution that would be killer for them that they can do 10x better than any other way? \n\nLet's say you focused on intra Bank escrow companies or clearing houses. Then you need to look at the costs of just using a legal entity with shared ownership that holds the data and does fair trade resolution. Why is your offering better than that? What are the other block chain offerings, does your protocol allow for increased savings? More contract volume? Is it 10x better? \n\nIf you think awesome banks sound great, look for innovation officers, tell them what you're building and why it can solve that problem better. Ask them to put you in touch with the people who do the thing. Talk to them see if they are excited by it. Is it yeah that sounds like really cool tech, good luck or is it that would really help us meet this year's strategic objectives, let's book in regular catch ups so I can keep tabs on progress. Hint the second one is actual interest. \n\nHope that helps!",

The main challenge IMO is that enterprise is getting better at using open source.\n\nSo where previously you could have exactly the same product but with a bit of training tacked on and sell to enterprise for 6/7 figures, now they're likely to just use the open source version. So getting revenue means that you have to build an open source thing people want and then try to leverage your brand to sell them an adjacent solution.\n\nThis a lot of hard work though it does help build you a bit of a natural ecosystem. That said I'd say the 2 players that took the open source approach in my industry seem to be struggling. One was a major player but is being canibalised by open source contributers that keep on extending the open source version in line with the paid product and the other I just don't hear about anymore.\n\nIt may not hold true across all industries and solution spaces but I really think enterprise adopting open source in the past few years has changed the equation.",

While selling first is a good idea I think we also need to be fair to the \"techie\" side of things. We are engineers /tinkerers. We love building stuff just to see how/whether it works. Thus, selling first with nothing tangible like an MVP feels odd. We build to see if the idea can pass the \"Workability Hypothesis\". Getting a cold response to our idea during the \"sell first\" phase can be such a cliffhanger for us.\n\nAlso Context does matter. Here in Africa, a low-tech environment, selling first with nothing in hand may not work.\n\nFactor in the Society's/Market's Trust levels. High Trust societies have High trust markets. Low Trust societies have Low trust markets. In the latter, you can only pass the threshold by at least building something. That proof is what potential clients would want to see before they part with their cash.",

I am currently trying to execute my SaaS startup idea and was originally planning to take the product-first approach, mostly because I am a tech person. Now I am convinced, after reading your post plus talking to a few investors, that I should be sales-first. But I have a couple questions that puzzle me. When you don\u2019t have a product how do you convince your potential customer, especially those technical ones, that you can build it? Do you just say yes to all of their requirements and push for a Letter of Intent or some sort of prepayment? I am curious if this would lead to an over optimized solution to just one customer. And what\u2019s the best way you found to get to your potential customers? Many thanks.",

You might be able to get a contract that says these are the payment terms pending sign-off that the solution is fit for purpose but actually getting the full payment not conditional on any sign off is going to be crazy hard. You might get an LOI or even just a verbal commitment and that's fine too. Less guaranteed, so as the level of surety drops off you'll want more potential customers to cover the higher level of drop off, the further up the sales pipeline you are. Once you put the sign-off clause in there is no risk if you can't build it, just the time they invest with you. \n\nThe commitment is amazing but the real goal is to iterate to something that they really want. Usually your first idea of what they need will be wrong to some extent and what you want to do is refine the proposition to something they are prepared to something they like enough to commit too up front.\n\nYou want to do this process with as many customers as possible. Your goal is to find the minimum feature set that at least 3 customers would actually be willing to pay for. If you can get 3 it will generally work for a lot of customers. This is how you try to make sure it generalises. Also at this stage you should be trying to commit to the smallest step that has a reasonable business case, this allows you to get revenues and grow fastest. If your customer really wants your product they should be really happy with a fast iterative process that gets them the solution the fastest.",

Who would you think would be a super fan of the platform? If it's social what is the hook to get people to want hours over everything else? Can you tell people about why they'd want to sign up and then get them to create an account so they're ready to go when it's made? How hard are you finding that? What feedback are you getting from the target audience on the hook? Etc.\n\nYou can do lots of validation. Your main problem is going to be not how awesome it's going to be with network effects but how can I make this great for 10, 20, 100 people and how do I make them sign up now before I make it and if they don't sign up, why and then adapt the proposition.\n\nI created an entire platform that needed loads of content but I had a good job. So my idea to get content was to give away an iPhone a month to the person who created the most content. The problem I never validated was that nobody actually believed an unheard of site would actually give them an iPhone. Even when I told people I met personally the story saying hey if you sign up and submit like one piece of content you'll get a phone because there is no competition right now, nobody believed it.\n\nAfter having made all this gamification stuff around the content creation it was all useless. I realised that I needed to seed the content and actually could have just done that. Had I validated the first premise. I'd asked people would you do enter this for an iPhone everybody says sure but I hadn't actually got them to create an account and upload a piece of content before doing all the work of the leader boards, notifications, etc. And the problem was it just seemed too good to be true. So you need to get them to complete the action based on the sell. In your case it sounds like sign up.",

                    "comment": "I wouldn't approach investors until I had some sales under my belt and an MVP. Not because I'm worried about them stealing the idea but because I would want to have at least proven it to some extent before taking on money.\n\nThe main point though is that people tend to way overestimate the value of an idea. Seriously if your customer can easily make what you want to sell them, then they'll do that when you try to sell to them if it's that easy.\n\nOtherwise the people in the company you're talking to have jobs to do and will be glad if you can deliver a chunk of value. \n\nI've only met one person that had their idea stolen by an investor but they had customers, a product and were already making millions in revenues. The investor thought the idea was great but had doubts about the team and leadership. They did as much of a brain drain as they could in pretend due diligence and then funded another team to compete. Turns out the other company never amounted to much, so bad call by the investor.\n\nHonestly though I've never seen a good idea that was only being done by one team. If you have an idea usually it's a certain set of circumstances that made you think it was a good idea to create a business around and a bunch of other people will have done the same thing at the same time. You might not know you have competitors but a year or two down the line and you suddenly all pop out of stealth mode. \n\nThe time and opportunities you lose trying to protect your idea will almost always be better spent telling everybody about your idea as you get valuable feedback, introductions, sales, etc.\n\nI was laughing with my cofounder about people that have never started a business being precious about ideas the other day. Ideas are worth almost nothing, execution is everything. MySpace, Friendster and Facebook. Facebook was last but executed better. Google wasn't close to the first search engine. People are so obsessed with their own ideas most of the time it's actually hard to get them to pay attention to yours.",

When you were first starting out did you quit your job to pursue your idea or did you continue to work a day job? I ask because I work in the same industry as the product/service I have an idea for. I\u2019d be out there pitching my idea to clients that are direct competitors to my employer. I\u2019m not sure how my employer would feel about that, and while I\u2019d be discreet, the industry I work in, while large, has a penchant for gossip and is quite incestuous.",

    "postText": "Hey r/startups,\n\nI lead sales + customer service for a startup with a team of 6. Our startup converts existing websites into mobile apps for a monthly fee. We have a few customers subscribed, with 50% of these being other startups looking to get mobile-only functions for their business or just expand their audience by being listed on the App Stores.\n\nMy question is around growth strategies:\n\n\\- We are thinking of offering a 'launch' program for brand-new startups where the team uses their background in web development to create a website to launch an MVP. The catch here would be that the new startup also signs up for our mobile app subscription for at least 12 months. \n\n**Do you think that is a legitimate market to target?** Or if they haven't launched a website yet themselves do they lack the drive to turn their MVP into a business, meaning we would likely lose them as a customer after the minimum sign-up period? \n\n**Do you think that 12 months as a minimum sign-up is too restrictive?** We need to get some return for helping launch a website + 2 apps but I don't want to promote the program if everyone here thought 12 months was way too long.\n\nThoughts on the minimum sign-up period, target market for this, or any general feedback is greatly appreciated!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n",

If your subscription would end up costing them \u00a335 a month - great! Awesome Idea. \n\nIf your mobile app subscription would end up costing them \u00a3200 a month - terrible idea, throw it in the bin and remap your strategy to just incorporate a single payment for the launch service as a type of upsell. \n\nSomewhere in between that, I think it's questionable and you should maybe do some targeted market research if still not confident, speak to people whom have started a business. Ask more questions than you can maybe on a Reddit post in detail about prospects thoughts on pricing strategies.",

I'll add a bit more specific pricing info below;  \nThe main business offering to get an iOS + Android app is $99/month with a one-off $399 conversion fee but they need an existing website. \n\nCurrent customers who already have a successful business have given us feedback that they enjoy our pricing. The idea was born out of 4 of us who work at an agency and having great customers be put off by the 100% custom app build fees that were usually $30K+. \n\nThe program in this post is aimed at targeting a new market of people who want to launch a startup rather than one already generating revenue. To encourage them to sign up we were thinking of offering a MVP website build for only a few hundred dollars if they launch the app with us for 12 months. \n\nTotal cost for a website build + launch and having two apps live for 12 months is about $2K. Do you think that is too high for a new startup to be enticed?",

I mean the first thing a startup should do is to create a website to validate the idea. The website doesn't need to be functional from the start but should explain the idea, product, or service. After the validation, your service can be valuable, especially when the company lacks expertise in the area.\n\nTo the second question: I feel like 12 months is too long. Why? Imagine the startup tests the product and fails. This can happen rather quickly. They would still have the 12-month contract they need to pay off. The startup requiring your services might be averse to long-term commitment.\n\nWhy don't you offer the service as an add-on to validate if your customers really need this service?",

I also agree that 12 months might feel long but I can't get our team to spend 2-4 weeks building a website and 2 mobile apps for someone who might shut it down in 2 months.\n\nI'm all for failing quickly and pivoting but not if I am making the upfront investment on their behalf! The fee is $99/month and I guess my question is that if the 12-month timeline is a motivator for the owner to push hard for 12 months or if it is likely to put people off for being too long. Do you think 6 months at maybe $150/month would be more reasonable?   \n\nWhen you say offer the service as an add-on, are you saying offer the apps as an add-on to developing websites for people? Our core business is converting websites into mobile apps but wanted to see if we can stimulate demand by creating more websites at steep discounts (a few hundred dollars for top-quality websites). I don't think it would be sustainable to be offering websites and the space is far more competitive than apps but is certainly an interesting thought.",

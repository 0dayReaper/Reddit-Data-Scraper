            "comment": "Prepare yourself. I'm going to bombard you with information - I've been in the sector for the best part of 3 and a half years \ud83d\ude02\n\nThe category of software you're looking for is most likely \"SaaS Management Platform\"; however there are some Fintech cross-over apps that allow you to also create virtual cards ***and*** track your SaaS subscriptions. Additionally, you'll also find some SaaS negotiation services that provide services to renegotiate your SaaS contracts, and include some SaaS management functionality.\n\nIn the SaaS management platform category, (detect SaaS, manage users, detect spend etc.) you'll probably find it useful to position yourself against the following:\n\n* [BetterCloud](https://www.bettercloud.com/)\n* [Vendr](https://www.vendr.com/) (they're more of a SaaS negotiation service, but with their acquisition of Blissfully, they also offer SaaS management platform capabilities)\n* [Zluri](https://www.zluri.com/)\n* [Torri](https://www.toriihq.com/)\n* [Trelica](https://trelica.com/)\n* [G2 Track](https://track.g2.com/)\n* [Stackshine](https://www.stackshine.io/)\n* [LicenceOne](https://www.licence.one/) (fair disclosure: I'm one of the cofounders)\n\nIn the \"Fintech crossover + SaaS management category\" (virtual cards or general finance apps + some SaaS tracking features), you'll probably want to have a look into:\n\n* [Cledara](https://www.cledara.com/)\n* [Quolum](https://quolum.com/)\n* [Zip](https://ziphq.com/)\n* [Rippling](https://www.rippling.com/)\n* [Ramp](https://ramp.com/)\n* [Spendesk](https://www.spendesk.com/en/)\n\nIn the SaaS negotiation service category, you'll also find the following:\n\n* [Vendr](https://www.vendr.com/)\n* [Sastrify](https://www.sastrify.com/)\n* [Tropic](https://www.tropicapp.io/)\n* [Spendflo](https://www.spendflo.com/)\n* [Welii](https://www.welii.io/)\n\n**RE: Making the product free/cheap and generating revenue on recommendations**\n\nFrom memory (but I might be wrong), this was part of the synergies that G2Crowd were interested in [when they purchased Siftery in 2019](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190328005272/en/G2-Releases-G2-Track-to-Help-Businesses-Optimize-Software-Spend). Likewise, I wouldn't be surprised if [Capiche](https://capiche.com/) didn't investigate this route of monetization.\n\nSince then, there have been a couple of recommendation pure-players ([Uniseed](https://en.uniseed.io/) and [Secret](https://www.joinsecret.com/) come to mind), but most that believe in this model seem to be going towards a paid SaaS management platform with added marketplace capabilities included.\n\n**My 2 cents (if you're going for the free + recommendation model)**\n\n1. The type of persona that would be interested in a \"free\" / \"you are the product\" are most likely freelancers and SMBs (as larger orgs, in my opinion, would be more tempted by the privacy and hand-free approaches of the SaaS negotiation services).\n2. I can't go into specifics, but if/when you begin doing pre-product user interviews with SMBs, I'd recommend asking them how often they estimate that they rip-and-replace software or add a new SaaS app to their org.\n3. You'll likely need to have a *really* low CAC and ultimately, I suspect that you'll come to the conclusion that SEO &amp; content are the only scalable channel. If that is indeed the case, you'll most likely end up competing for the same eyeballs that G2 Crowd/Track, Secret, and Capterra are all competing for - so  try finding some opportunities that they might have missed or under-exploit\n4. Be wary about adding banking aggregation (Plaid, MX, Norigen, Bridge etc.) into the mix. They're going to up your fixed costs, which you'll need to keep to a minimum on a recommendation model; ***and*** you'll risk running into the trap of having to explain to users \"*We don't sell your banking &amp; revenue data, it's only used to provide recommendations*\"\n\nWith all of that said, I suppose we might end up being potential competitors one, so take everything I said with a pinch of salt.\n\nHonestly though, I'm just fan of co-opetition and not competition - the pie's big enough for us to co-exist all in my opinion \ud83e\udd37\n\nGood luck! \ud83d\udcaa",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'm launching a vitamin supplement subscription website at the end of the month. I'm getting everything sorted and preparing to be ready to sell once the website is up. My question is how many orders should I expect in the first 3-6 months? Is there a way to calculate this so I have a vague understanding of what to expect? Would be really helpful to manage expectations and workload. Thanks in advance!",

Putting products on the big players (amazon, etsy, ebay etc) cos they already have an audience which is specifically going to that website to buy stuff.  \nYou can then guage interest in your product and with sales you can send info on discounts if they use your site in the future that kind of thing and shift the customer base across.  \n\n\nI'm no e-commerce expert and there will be far more up to date or nuanced tactics, but that is a general strategy",

Did you do enough preliminary research?  \n\n\nIn any case, it's really hard to estimate this regardless of how much work you do. You'll just have to see. Especially when adding time as a variable. It's even harder to predict how many users you could have sign up within a given timeframe.",

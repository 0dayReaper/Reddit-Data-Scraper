Brainstorm in chat GPT, can give you tons of ideas if you have a general idea. From there just do it, so many people on this sub talk about making a whole business plan and say they have it all figured out but then give some excuse that basically just means they don\u2019t want to put the work in to do it. And sometimes you may realize ur \u201cgrand plan\u201d was actually a horrible idea and just sounded good in ur head. Example: You think since there\u2019s hundreds of millions of phone users, it shouldn\u2019t be hard to just find 10,000 of them to buy a 10$ product and make 100k, it\u2019s never as easy as your mind makes it seem. If it fails just find something else and try it again.",

It almost seems like the way to get ideas now are more B2B type problems. \n\nBut even with finding problems in my life, the figuring out if someone is doing it is also kinda hard even with Google (at least I feel it is). How do you go about figuring out if the idea you have is a viable idea?",

Worked a corporate job at a progressive, growing company. Learned a lot. Met a lot of amazing people. I advanced quickly. Became a director after a few years. Learned more. Wanted to do my own thing. \n\nMet up with a former coworker who was a a superstar and she was co-founding a startup. I was interested and they could pay me a decent salary and gave me a reasonable amount of equity. We ideated on the other founders dream idea. I built a platform around it. We were floundering financially after about a year. I was doing contract work part time and reduced my hours because the sales just weren\u2019t there and we needed more time. \n\nAnd then we formed a partnership with another company and integrated with their platform to help them deliver their product because our software could pretty easily accomplish what they needed and we rolled it out for them in a few months. They acquired us a few months after that. I headed up tech at the new company, built another platform and we were acquired again like a year and a half later.\n\nMoral of the story: The problem we solved wasn\u2019t even our main thing. It just happened to work out circumstantially. Networking. We had the features that supported what they needed. I was honestly considering removing them because they weren\u2019t used. That\u2019s what got us acquired. Just never know how things will work out.",

I feel like pain points in the average person's life have basically all been solved. And everyone has those ideas. But if we take B2B for example, there seems to be a lot of area to find pain points, but does that take just cold emailing companies and setting up time to basically shadow them or get them to tell you what their pain points are?\n\nIt's almost as if you have to work in a niche industry to find the pain points of that industry to find out first hand what the pain points are.",

Pick your favorite ones and do some basic preliminary market research on them. If you find a gap in the market, do more in-depth research. Find some experts on the topic and reach out to them.

It started as a side project at a large company. I didn\u2019t really know anything about the industry I was entering, just needed a side project and as luck would have it the project evolved and worked out for a period of time. Turned down a big acquisition offer unfortunately but that\u2019s life. A lot of lessons learned, it\u2019s valuable when you have your own success and failure experience to rely on instead of having to live vicariously through business anecdotes.\n\nI\u2019m on to my second startup now. This idea came from a mathematical insight. A certain piece of information theory missing in the universe that solves a lot of small but annoying inefficiencies at most tech companies. Not sure if this approach will work but I know I would use the product it if I didn\u2019t build it \u2014 can\u2019t say that about the first. We\u2019ll see",

Honestly, I don\u2019t recommend being an entrepreneur to anybody. The hours suck, there\u2019s no money in it for years, and importantly you\u2019re very very likely to completely fail and never get the big payday you dreamed of\u2026 it\u2019s not a smart thing to do. Not deterred?? Let\u2019s get real:\n\nWere you one of the smartest kid in class growing up? Did you go to a top university? Have you done ANYTHING yet in your life that objectively would be considered creative, innovative, entrepreneurial, raise eyebrows, etc. have you ever sold anything? Are you desperate for attention? Are you the life of the party? Funny? Hot? Anything?? Do you feel you have to be creating something or you\u2019ll just kind of go crazy?\n\nMost people just aren\u2019t built this way. I halfway am, and have made millions doing it, but the top VCs see through me in a heart beat. The difference between me and top founders is probably even wider than the distance between me and you. Take it from someone who\u2019s been around\u2026 made it to basecamp, and seen the peak in the distance, this ain\u2019t the way to live your life. Get out!!",

There are certainly a lot of truths and realities in your comment about being an entrepreneur and building a startup, but that just simply underlines the unwrittent standards what the startup building grinders go through and have to face.\n\nI am now very early into building something with a couple of other people. This is my third shot at it. Previous two times ended rather early, so there was no major pain or loss for cutting it off. I also held a permanent job and raised family and studied when I tried the business ideas. Did that deter me? On the contrary - get me more hyped and motivated and trying again, but smarter this time. Mind you I am still in that same position - having a family to take care of, liabilities to cover, studies to finish, but without a permanent job (though this is something I will not leave as is, because I need to have some recurring financial income).\n\nMy answer to your recommendation to OP is - do it if you want to try and see how it works. If it doesn\u2019t then sit down, think throuugh everything and, if you believe that one little bruise will heal quickly and it doesn\u2019t hurt then, go for it again, but be wiser and bolder this time.",

What\u2019s the polite way to say no? Some people could be useful advisors, but the majority not.\n\nIt is absolutely insane how many people want to get in and want equity for advice. Is this normal for founders, or am I just overreacting? There are a lot of them who want to meet, but I don\u2019t see the purpose if they\u2019re not a customer or prospect. \ud83d\ude05",

I learned very quickly that in the business world many people are constantly looking for ways to fuck you,  they will record what you say, or try to get you to say something that they can blackmail you with later.  A lot of people are ass-holes.\n\nThat being said,  treat the people who do give value like gold,  there are indeed some amazing people that I love, and would share equity with because I feel they truly deserve it.",

I just told them sorry but we didn\u2019t need any help right now and we\u2019re saving equity specifically for VCs. But in the future, once we were more established, I\u2019d consider giving them a salary if they applied for an available position.\n\nIt was amaaaaaaazing how many people lost interest the moment equity was out. Not surprised, none of them seemd salty.\n\nEdit: Also, be careful with \u201cadvisors\u201d. I have so many highly experienced people in my network. I think if you\u2019re not a dick and being genuine, most people want to help. Some people I\u2019ve met through networking events. I seek out \u201cgrey hairs\u201d and ask them for advice and they just give it to me. You\u2019d be surprised how many people want to help just to help. Maybe it\u2019s a karma thing, idk. But there isn\u2019t a problem I\u2019ve had to solve where I had to give equity to solve it.",

These are all people who can suck time, money and joy out of your project.\n\nHave a plan, identify what you need skills wise and focus only on people who can do that for you. Be clear about what you need, what the reward is and how that reward can be triggered. Anybody serious will be open to targets and accountability, though they might want to negotiate. The wasters will run a mile.",

Its honestly not worth dealing with disingenuous people.\n\nI provide advice to a number of companies but I always do it free at first. I have gotten equity but I had been working with these folks for a minimum of one year and it's always the entrepreneurs that want to formalize a structure. They knew I provide value and I knew I could provide value. What's the point of getting some equity if I as an advisor can't provide value, I am not here to rob people.\n\nI always recommend that you work with whoever you want to bring on first with no strings attached.",

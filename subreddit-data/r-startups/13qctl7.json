    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nAn odd one for you, but maybe you can help\u2026\n\nHow do you truly believe in the potential of your business if you\u2019ve never \u2018thought big\u2019 before?\n\nAfter 3yrs I find myself as founder of a company generating a small amount of revenue (PaaS), positioned for scale and about to approach investors to raise \u00a3250k. If I raise and meet targets, the business could be a multi-million pound global company in five years and I\u2019ll exit. That\u2019s the plan, and I have worked with an 8-man steering group over the past two years to ensure the business is scalable and the problem/solution, market fit is proven. So, on the one hand, I\u2019m proud and optimistic for the future, however, on the other hand\u2026\n\nI am struggling to truly believe this is possible. I\u2019ve never thought in terms of tens of thousands let alone 100s of thousands before, and whilst I daydream about making a better life for my partner and I, I find I just can\u2019t convince myself this is possible. And I think that is now holding me back - I wake up each day fearful and like I\u2019m fighting a losing battle, not like a champ out to succeed. \n\nHow do I overcome this limiting mindset? \n\nAny and all advice is welcome. \n\nThanks.",

I have days where I feel so confident in the future of the business and its potential but then when I look at how high those figures are I sort of get the feeling of am i just dreaming and why could someone like me even do these types of numbers. Why should I deserve to be in this position? Seems to good to be true.",

I say to myself over and over again what my dreams are and why they're important to me. \n\nAlso, reminding myself of \"growth mindset\" has been pivotal for me.

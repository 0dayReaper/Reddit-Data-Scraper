I have startup experience and will be investing 100% of the needed money myself as well as probably putting in about 30-50% of the time needed.\n\nThe mission of the company is to support lesser known artists\nThe artistic side of sourcing artists for the merchandising or the perspective of a lesser known artist is something im unfamiliar with. \n\nI have a potential partner with this experience who came up with the idea but doesn't know startups that is asking for pure equity and will handle this portion of the business.\n\nI have another partner who is asking for pure equity to help me with running the operations when I have time constraints. But isn't the most experienced and I will have to teach them the ropes.\n\nHow much should I give each of them? I am also trying to establish as an LLC just to add context. I want to make sure to have enough in reserve for investors as well.\n\nTo be clear, they are not asking for any pay. Only equity",

            "comment": "So let's assume that you need to spare 10% for your Series-A investors and 10% for the stock option pool from the beginning. (that might change, your call). You will be left with 80% for three cofounders. \n\nYou seem to both know the bells-and-whistles and startups, so you may have an upper hand. You also will be putting the seed money, hence you should have the greatest amount of shares for sure. \n\nYour first partner seems to be key for that she/he knows the artistic side and owns the idea. If you didn't invest any money, you would have close amount of shares (your experience would put you a bit forward) with your first partner. But money changes it :)\n\nYour second partner is also needed as a hustler as she/he will invest a lot of time in the organization of things. However, the lack of experience and need to be taught the job makes me think that around 10% should be fine for this partner.\n\nFinally, by doing some black magic calculus, I ended up smth like 41 - 26 - 13 equities. But I know very little context and you will decide.\n\nWhatever you decide, you have to make sure that you explain your reasonings to each of these people one by one and very clearly. Emphasize your investment, your expertise and that you are gonna put at least 1/3 of the effort needed. If they have second doubts about being undervalued, this will affect your startup deeply, and ruin your investment too. So make sure that you spare enough equity for each of them to have full motivation and dedication. These are the people who should be with you till the end and spend their whole time building this thing. If they are unhappy, you will be screwed either now or later down the road.",

That was the reason for me mentioning investors at all in the OG post is I've never decided equity allocations in this way before and wanted to keep dilution in mind.",

Just focus on customers and building solutions that solve real problems for them. \n\nCome back once you have that part figured out and we can help with thinking through investment strategy and dilution.",

Figure out if there is a business here first. \n\nI\u2019ve tried this a few times before and what has worked out well is when you have a ragtag crew interested in starting something for equity, where they have little experience, just try it get the business going. You don\u2019t need to incorporate yet. \n\nJust start building, and give everyone assignments. See who actually contributes and lives how well you work together. \n\nOdds are extremely high that at least one of these people will not work out\u2014especially if you all haven\u2019t worked together previously. \n\nThe crappy situation is when you go through the entire corporation process, and then someone can\u2019t hack it/you realize you\u2019ve made a mistake. It\u2019s a huge waste of time, energy and money. Nothing worse than realizing you have a 30% partner on paper who\u2019s actually only worth 3% equity. \n\nJust start working on the business find customers. Get paying clients. Build out roles and responsibilities. Once it becomes clear you work well together, then memorialize the partnership. If you\u2019re contributing 100% of the capital, then you can dictate the equity. You\u2019ll on is the players better by then, and can come up with what you believe is fair/they will go for. Then make it a conversation/negotiation. Figure out the scenario you are most comfortable with. \n\nIe if you could theoretically see yourself being 33/33/33 partners then it\u2019s actually pretty easy in the future for you to have the conversation. But I wouldn\u2019t signal any indication to either partner of what you\u2019re willing to do in advance of actually allocating equity. It\u2019ll set expectations, and right now you need people focused on building a business, not what portion they\u2019re going to own. 33% of a business worth $0 is still $0.",

This is where the OP has control though. \n\nThe most extreme version is the 33/33/33 split (most likely) where they are equal partners with everyone.\n\nIf the OP is ok with that scenario, you can negotiate into any other scenario from there.  \n\nHowever, if the OP is expecting something like 98/1/1, then there will most definitely be issues down the road, and getting something rough early would make sense. Letting people know they\u2019re never going to get more than 1% equity in any scenario, people should know that before dedicating time or energy.\n\nBut it\u2019s in the OP\u2019s control of how they want to approach it. \n\nIf you broach the topic too soon, it gets people focused on equity and not on building a business, which can kill things before it even gets off the ground. But if everyone knows they\u2019re earning their equity and proving they\u2019re worth it now, it kicks the can down the road until there actually is something worth fighting over, as opposed to fighting now when there is nothing.",

Vesting seems like the more natural alternative to align incentives without creating friction - then the bad fit cofounder can be taken out of the company without any outstanding equity owed as well.",

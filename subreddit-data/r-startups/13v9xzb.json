However this changes at each round of investment, along with the number of outstanding and authorized shares, depending on the growth plan for the company, and how well your executives and investors wish to compensate employees. Depending on your bylaws, it could change at every board meeting. Personally, I would do 20% or higher because I feel strongly about employee compensation.",

And we're in a space where we are likely building a company that will sell for $50 million, not $5 billion, so it's not going to be like an Uber or FB where early employees cash out $20mm options.",

Up to 40%\n\nIt depends on what you need to hire in versus what you already have.\n\nDo you need C level people? They'll take 5-10% each.\n\nSpecialized engineers? A critical specialist can be worth 15%, but typically 3-5%.\n\nCommon engineers? 0.5-1% each\n\nThese are all assuming initial MVP is built but has a lot of technical debt before you even begin searching for product-market fit. Generally this would line up roughly with preseed money. For seed (minimal tech debt, looking for product-market fit) generally divide by 2.",

You re-up it as needed but it should carry you through Series A or so depending on how much you need to attract employees.  \n\n\nThe best hires are generally already working so A lot of it is incentive to peel people away from FAANG's or in lieu of cash.  Early employees are usually given bigger incentives because they are more formative to the founding and taking bigger risks, later stage employees are usually given flat share amounts.    \n\n\nThe pie is always and only 100% so in later rounds you may have to re-cap or re allocate which means dilluting existing share holders.  That being said I would have gladly taken a dilution to 0.1% of UBER  in their Series A round.",

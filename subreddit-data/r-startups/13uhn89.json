Can you imagine if someone asked for their annual salary up front and then said \"but don't worry I'll be good for the work the rest of the year\".\n\n\\^\\^ This is essentially what you're asking for. Plus, the likelihood of you getting let go prior to your one-year cliff is very small. I think you're underestimating how much work it is to replace someone who is talented in a startup. \n\nNot only would it be a massive red flag to anyone looking at a cap table to see equity vesting up front, but it also tells your team of two cofounders that you yourself are coming in with a lot of distrust. Honestly, and I'm trying to be direct here so that you understand where I'm coming from....if someone asked me for immediate vesting of equity as employee #3 I'd almost certainly say that's enough of a red flag that they are not worth hiring.",

In other words, for every Mark Zuckerberg who was a cutthroat backstabber and utilized that to grow his success, there are 10,000 other versions of that who flame out because they thought they needed to go fast and break things.",

If you're sales lead, you are being held accountable to the success metric of why this is a business...its revenue. That means that you are the key holder of all the sales relationships (Assuming b2b).\n\nI also have no idea in what world a sales lead turns into a COO. Those aren't analogous skillsets at all. If anything, they're the opposite. COOs are held accountable to the underlying cost model of the business overseeing things like HR / Finance / Legal on top of Customer Support. Typically a CEO is the one whose ass is on the line for sales/revenue particularly if this is early-stage.\n\nIf you're in charge of growing revenue and then they are transitioning you into a C-level role I would assume nothing less than 10% vested over 4 years. That also assumes that you haven't baked in incentives into your contact if you meet certain sales quotas. \n\nBut, honestly, this thing has red flag city written all over it.

Also consider an incubator (ideally one that does not take equity) as a means to get connected to your local startup community.

Do you already know who your customers are, at least broadly? If it\u2019s smart city, are you B2B, B2G, both? Do you know what problem you\u2019re solving for them? \n\nif yes to all of these, it should be fairly easy to identify who the exact people are you\u2019re trying to attract, and then from there how you can position it so they understand what you\u2019re offering to them. because \u201cbuild a community\u201d can mean a lot of things but if you don\u2019t have all of this dialed in, it\u2019s going to be really hard to know who to target and easily communicate why THEY should be part of your community.",

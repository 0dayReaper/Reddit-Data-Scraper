    "postText": "In actual sense, people don\u2019t leave bad companies; they leave bad bosses.\n \n&gt;\u201cPeople leave managers, not companies.\u201d - Marcus Buckingham\n \nBad bosses are the greatest liability to an establishment and even worse than fraud. Employees leave bad bosses and the companies that allow the bad boss to thrive. A bad boss can prevent a new generation of dynamic and enterprising employees from emerging.\n \nThe worst place an employee can be was stuck in an organization with a micro-manager who doesn't care about their development and there are no opportunities for growth and advancement.\n \nAccording to a survey conducted by the International Association of Administrative Professionals, a bad boss is a NO.1 reason employees quit. The greatest threat to a company\u2019s culture is a bad or toxic boss.\n \nOften, talented individuals are forced to job-hop from one company to another in order to have a new lease on life. The greatest job of a leader is to create the right environment. When the environment is conducive, growth, fulfilment and productivity are almost automatic and even inevitable.\n \n\"Micromanagement is a complete waste of everybody\u2019s time. It sucks the life out of employees, fosters anxiety and creates a high-stress work environment.\" Micromanagement has the same toxic attributes as helicopter surveillance in psychology, which entails unrelenting stalking of a person which robs one of their freedom, autonomy and individuality. The anxiety of such an employee subjected to micromanagement will increase while confidence may take a tumble. Most of the time a person says, \"I hate my JOB!\" it has something to do with their direct supervisor.\n \nSome managers get so caught up in the bottom line and increasing the revenue stream that they forget to treat people with dignity and respect. Very few bosses show empathy towards their team members and this helps improve overall team performance.\n \nBad bosses come in different forms and shades, which is actually the object of this piece. What are those things that bosses do to drive their employees beyond the edge? These are:\n \n* **Unhealthy Expectations**\n \nA good boss sets expectations high enough to stretch us, but healthy enough not to break us. Unhealthy expectation strains the working environment. It makes others look as if they are incapable.\n \n* **Zero Tolerance For Mistakes**\n \n&gt;\u201cFreedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.\u201d - Mahatma Gandhi\n \nMistakes are an integral part of the learning system. When employees make mistakes that they will always do, we must encourage them to learn from it. Mistakes are painful when they happen, but years later, a collection of mistakes is what is called experience.\n \n* **Lack Of Training And Development**\n \n&gt;\u201cTrain people well enough so they can leave, treat them well enough so they don\u2019t want to.\u201d - Richard Branson\n \nAn untrained staff is a liability. No matter the level of incompetency, consistent training will always make a difference. The only thing worse than training your employees and having them leave is not training them and having them stay.\n \nYou don\u2019t build a business; you build people, and then people build the business.\n \nWe hire individuals because we believe they are capable of doing the job. Then trust them to get the job done. Limiting the potential of a great employee by being inflexible, is limiting the potential of your organization. If things are not going the way management wants - there is always a better way than micromanaging people. Train, mentor and coach employees and give them clear objectives. Then get out of their way. A manager's job is to provide guidance and support. It's not monitoring an employee's every movement. The best ideas and advancements come as a result of empowering your team.\n \n&gt;\"A bad boss can take a good staff and destroy it, causing the best employees to flee and the remainder to lose all motivation.\"\n\n*A negative boss is the worst \u2018environment\u2019 in any workplace.*",

            "comment": "&gt; The worst place an employee can be was stuck in an organization with a micro-manager who doesn't care about their development and there are no opportunities for growth and advancement.\n\nHope this doesn\u2019t come off as pedantic, but it\u2019s not close to the worst place an employee can be, from my personal experience. \n\nI was a newly-minted attorney 9 years ago and it was actually 9-years ago 2/17 (you can check, a Tuesday) that I thus began my first day of an 18-month ordeal that literally gave me mild PTSD due to the abuse and trauma. \n\nAbuse and trauma? For not being good enough? Piece of cake. I was raised in a Chinese first generation household in America. \n\nBut abuse and trauma for shits and giggles? To cock block me from leapfrogging my manager? To *sabotage* my career, as she did with the 6 prior associates she managed and fired consecutively?\n\n**She didn\u2019t *not* have an interest in my advancing my career so much as she had an obsession with ruining my career before I got the hang of things. First 6 months she was peachy because I was a huge help for her workload \u2014 just to show how insane she is, she gave me a copy of her billing sheet as a template and she managed to BILL 28 HOURS IN A DAY.**\n\nAfter 6 months of working under her and the half-present sole partner, she began to turn on me once the partner started laying thick praise on me. \n\nTo backtrack, by week 4 of my job, my colleagues \u2014 in other departments \u2014 warned me about her and to CYA, or cover your ass. Boy, I wish I had listened. \n\nShe started *verbally* giving me court appearance dates to cover for her, and I would end up a full 24 hours late even though I wrote the date and time down verbatim but it was her word vs mine, and we/I got sanctioned for it. Next time she tried it I emailed her for confirmation and she chewed me out, with CC to the sole partner, that I must have a low attention span. \n\nThis abuse lasted for almost a year. For the final 3 months I dealt with a lot of closed door meetings between my supervisor and boss. \n\n3. Months. \n\n3 months of not knowing if that day will be your last. I was diagnosed with either panic attack onset or PTSD. I couldn\u2019t sleep but I couldn\u2019t stay awake. My heartbeats shook my bed. I wanted to die. \n\nFinally, I got fired for all sorts of bull shit she compiled, like taking a 7-minute bathroom break. \n\nSuddenly the weight lifted. Felt even better when the partner said \u201cI just don\u2019t get it. Your work for me has been stellar, but [redacted] tells me your work is below par and unacceptable. Sorry, we have to let you go.\u201d\n\nShe was now 7-for-7 in firing her underljngs. Those asking what happened to her: long story short, she botched two big cases for repeat clients and the firm lost them, then moved from a cushy office to a business park, then went out of business. She got demoted then fired in between. \n\nI perhaps should have taken time off to correct myself but I managed to get another job 4 days later and begin work only 10 days after getting fired. A blessing and a curse. \n\nYou see, I started getting heavy anxiety about closed doors and office gossip. I didn\u2019t deal with it in a healthy way. I drank a lot at home and god damn me, I got hooked on the rest of the 27 percocets I got prescribed for my collapsed lung. \n\nIt was a one-month bender that I remember little of. I eventually took a \u201csabbatical\u201d and did outpatient rehab for two weeks while not at work and then 6 more months while at work. The drinking and painkillers weren\u2019t the cause or problem, just symptoms of me being emotionally abused for so long as a grown man under a woman who held my future. \n\nBut all was good. I came back to work clean 2 weeks later and fine in 6 months total, but I had to change jobs due to my shame. \n\nIt still fucks me up thinking about it nearly a decade later. \n\nTLDR: No, there are worse things than working for someone who doesn\u2019t care for or about you. There\u2019s working for someone looking to dive bomb your career. And it is PTSD inducing. ",

It's being discussed here because this just happens to be a thread about bosses. It's a problem, though-and as someone who's been there, one of the harder problems to diagnose absent anyone *telling* the people higher up the food chain \"I'm quitting because of my direct supervisor\" which people who quit, wouldn't you know it-don't often get the chance to do.\n\nIt's not sad, it's not pathetic, it's a real issue in the workforce that deserves as much earnest talk and consideration as discussions about wages and earnings do. \n\nNo one's acting like it's the only problem just because someone created an easy catchphrase for it.\n\n&gt;people follow it because it's the easiest excuse for a reason to quit on the planet.\n\nTbh this sounds like the attitude of exactly the type of boss this thread is on about:a bad one; if you don't want to entertain the idea that relationships between you and the person who oversees you has a direct impact on getting work done, feeling like progress is being made and general levels of employee mental health. That kind of dismissiveness towards issues people feel are genuine tentpoles in the workplace are *exactly* what bad bosses do and why people take their talents elsewhere.",

Productivity is suffering because of inter-team dynamics?  Why didn't the boss navigate the political waters and resolve the underlying issue?  My boss is a micro-managing jerk?  Why didn't the boss back off and just let the employees do work?\n\nThere's always an air of \"shoulda woulda coulda\" with bosses because there is some power in being responsible and potentially able to solve issues.  As an employee there's some safety in making someone else take a risky decision and the fallout from it.\n\nI'd agree that there's a bazillion reasons for someone to leave a company, but when that company wants to fix a problem, good businesses go after people who want to own the issue.  Blaming it on things nobody can control means they're really just unwilling to confront the issue.",

In my opinion, the reality is the opposite: Good managers keep talent from quitting.\n\nI've certainly see people quit over a crappy manager, but more often I've seen people quit because of systemic company-wide issues - underpaying, overworked, career stagnation, unrealistic expectations. A good manager can help to mitigate these. Often, they are simply too much to overcome unless the manager is willing to risk his job.",

A lot of people quit their jobs because they find better opportunities that are unrelated to their job\u2019s leadership. \n\nBut, more in line with the post title, some people like to think that money and benefits shouldn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re happy at our place of employment. But people who think like this are either new to the job market\u2014with plans to get promoted\u2014or complacent, risk adverse workers who\u2019ve embraced their working environment culture and expect it to last forever. \n\nIn the later, as coworkers move on and things change with time, these complacent people become embittered because their safe little bubble is disintegrating around them. It\u2019s just the way of the business world. \n\nAnother reason people quit jobs is because the work just plain sucks. After a few years in a type of work, a lot people simple decide that it\u2019s soul-crushing. And NO, they don\u2019t go out and start business in droves\u2014they start new careers that better align with their emotional reward expectations. Again, unrelated to good/bad bosses. ",

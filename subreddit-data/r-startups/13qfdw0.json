    "postText": "Me (CTO) and my co-founder (CEO) designated our roles for two main reasons: I had more stamina and got more enjoyment from coding, and he got those things from people and ideating. \n\nThat worked great for the beginning stages when I was mainly building and he was mainly networking and trying to raise, but now that we've grown we find ourselves merging our tasks more. \n\nWe both do a ton of coding, we both handle a ton of customer service, and we're both ideating and doing user research all of the time. We just feel like there's so much to do at all times. I still do maybe 20% more technical work than he does, and vice versa for him with people and thinking, so we're still somewhat within our expected roles despite there beings lots of overlap.\n\nI just wanted to hear from other CTO's: how did you manage the shift in responsibilities as traction increased &amp; there were more things to do? How can I expect my role to continue to change over the company lifespan? Thanks in advance!",

If you try to enforce old \"pact\" you had made, it will cause discomfort between you two. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been the CTO of large teams and even had the need to create our own management methodology as the team was growing incredibly quick. And I can tell you with absolute certainty, soon you won't be doing any development building yourself, but rather planning it and managing the teams to do it. \n\nI suggest you read this too: https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/gu77hj/some\\_things\\_i\\_have\\_learned\\_as\\_vpecto\\_in\\_my\\_career/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3",

Building the product, building a team, building its culture, etc..  \n\nLate: Not that much building.  Depending on your preferences (external vs internal focus), you're casting a vision, defining roadmap, creating alignment with the other senior management team, unblocking people, and career developing people.",

Hire good (better) people to do that, and focus a lot of your time on strategic initiatives that will help the business scale for the future. Less thinking about the actual code, more thinking about rtos and rpos, compliance / security / process, cost management, etc. Things that put your business in a place to be competitive at scale.",

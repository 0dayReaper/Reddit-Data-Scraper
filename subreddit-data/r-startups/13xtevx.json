    "postText": "Pretty much the title. I have the opportunity to raise the same amount that I need either from friends or from an angle that I have met recently.\n\nI need help in deciding which one to choose. We are in pre-product stage and planning to go live in 2 months. Already lined up a few paid customers who are waiting on us to deliver the product. \n\nAny suggestions which one would be a better engagement? The angle comes from startup background and has great network that can be helpful for us down the line. Also, not to mention his expertise in strategy and business in general.\n\nKindly suggest.",

They can also help with follow up help sometimes.  Both directly and just with name recognition.  Sometimes if you talk to an investor and they find out certain investors are invested then they will be more apt to join in.  Whereas you family is most likely people they don't know.\n\nAlso if your company shuts down, i think its easier to deal with angels.  Thats just business to them, wheraes family and friends might get rather pissed.",

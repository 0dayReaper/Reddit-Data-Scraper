I see some VCs and some founders hyping it up on Twitter.\n\n But diving into each session description and it most looks like either promos put on by some startups or happy hour parties. \n\nI feel like I could be better off continuing to build my product. I\u2019ve got some early users and have a clear idea of what new features I need to build. \n\nBut I\u2019ve never been big into the social/ networking thing. What would you do? Have you been in a similar situation?",

I work in a large financial organisation and I meet a lot of interns, graduates, etc - at the start of their careers.\n\nWhat I learnt, is that most of them have the concept of \"networking\" completely wrong. Thinking it's about how many people you keep in contact with, how many people you meet, etc.\n\nIt's not. In fact, this approach is boarding on being a nuisance, especially if you aren't a naturally charismatic person and just set up meetings for me to do all the talking - erhh.\n\nNetworking is about finding the right people and demonstrating and communicating what value you can offer them. This can mean navigating through others or attending events in hope off making a good impression with the right people.\n\nKeep in mind - it's all about what value you can bring people. You have no value? Why bother, come back when you have something to talk about and impress with.\n\nJust being making 'friends' when you're an adult is nonsense. We value people who add value to us or people around us.",

If it\u2019s about networking, identify 10 ppl you want to meet there. That may include specific companies you think could be customers, investors, someone in a similar industry, etc. Literally write their names down, and then figure out what value you can provide to them. Write that down. Then you can connect on LinkedIn or cold email, and say \u201chey I\u2019ll be at the event tomorrow. I saw you\u2019ll be there and you\u2019re working on x. I solve x with y. I\u2019m hoping to grab a few minutes to introduce myself tomorrow.\u201d Or, maybe you want to talk to someone in a similar industry\u2026\u201dhey, i saw you\u2019ll be at the event tomorrow. I know you\u2019re targeting x persona, as am I with my new product. Id love to grab a few minutes of your time to introduce myself and ask a few questions about how you\u2019re going after x persona.\u201d  This warms them up, but most importantly it shows you did some research. You can\u2019t be the guy asking for coffee for no reason. But if you researched me and think you can\nSolve a problem for me we can talk, or if you\u2019re a young entrepreneur figuring shit out we can talk. I don\u2019t want to talk to the guy that wants to know \u201chow to start a business,\u201d because those are questions they can get from google, but if you\u2019re a young person with a thoughtful question, I\u2019m happy to help. \n\nLast thing, when you\u2019re at the event your goal is not to sell. Your goal is to \u201cschedule a conversation.\u201d So you emailed these ten ppl, now at the event go introduce yourself as the guy who emailed, give them a little recap in case they didn\u2019t read it, and give them a quick pitch on how you\u2019ll add value, and close it out with asking if you can grab time on their calendar next week. Doing so shows you a)respect their time at the show, b) won\u2019t waste their time in the future because you aren\u2019t wasting it now, and c) you\u2019re thoughtful enough to email, seek me out, and do a tailored \u201cpitch.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s a fine line and this could be overly done, but I always prefer to be seen as the person that\u2019s prepared and delivers on what I say, versus the majority of folks that want to be entrapments but don\u2019t follow through, don\u2019t plan, etc.\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "I think random cold networking is usually of pretty low value. Important people are mobbed at networking events and you won\u2019t make an impression.\n\nHappy hours are good opportunities to connect with people you already know and need to know better - particularly if you have arranged to say hi to them at a specific event. You can strengthen a social connection and improve the likelihood they\u2019ll take an actual meeting later. You can make a generally positive impression, even if you don\u2019t spend the time \u201cpitching.\u201d\n\nThe most valuable thing about these \u201cevents,\u201d though, is they bring people to the area who are not otherwise nearby, and at a time when they are specifically open for meetings. The best way to use something like \u201ctech week,\u201d and I have no idea if \u201ctech week\u201d is actually any good, is to reach out to people you already know a little and would like to meet with, and arrange to meet them for coffee or a drink or something. Worst case scenario they tell you they\u2019ll be at some happy hour or social event and you can catch them there.\n\nAs far as how much networking matters altogether, that\u2019s a question for you - do you already know all the people you care about? Are you raising money now or in the next 18 months such that you need to meet VCs? Are there potential customers around? Those are the two most important reasons - recruiting / meeting potential talent is probably third.",

And because it\u2019s just a chat, nobody will know if half your pitch is not built yet.\n\nYou may know your vision, what people are asking for and what features to build. But on the business building side, no plan survives first contact with reality. You need to practice pitching. \n\nJust join groups or seek out people standing alone. Ask politely what they do, then once they ask you, you can just try and excite them about your idea with your mini pitch (max 4 sentences).\n\nJust by the questions people ask and the points they ask questions about, you\u2019ll quickly find out which talking points land best. And even better, by trying again, you automatically start honing your pitch further until it gets ever smoother.\n\nThis may not bring leads or users right away, but it will be invaluable once you start fund raising, selling at scale and especially marketing later.",

Companies host events with the benefit of promoting themselves and getting more business. I am not naturally a sales persona or an extrovert, but I met one founder who came from Manila, another from Sydney, another from Mexico City and I got super charged by their commitment to put themselves out there. \n\nI live in Oakland and I was not happy about the 20 min ferry ride, I forgot what I take for granted. Ended up meeting an analyst at a VC firm who told me they would invest in a company like us and asked me to get in touch when I get to seed stage. Spoke to a few founders who wanted to use my product and were very encouraging about my startup. Good vibes overall. \n\nIts not an academic or deep knowledge gathering forum. Its supposed to be light. But having said that Andrew Chen's session was really amazing, I learned VCs change course as fast as the wind direction it seems, so it was great to hear what the current VC mindset is. This is helping me re-think my pitch deck and hit the points that are more valuable in today's macro economic setting.",

Sure, it's taking time away from you building out features for the week but you can meet:\n\nOther entrepreneurs with business that complement yours and help propel your growth  \nInfluencers within the space  \nEarly adopters/advocates  \nMentors\n\nOn top of this, you can refine your pitch and get high quality feedback. What you don't want happening is you build out your product and then have to start making your network from scratch after the fact",

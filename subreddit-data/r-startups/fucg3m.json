    "postText": "Just a small startup I\u2019ve been working on for three years. Blood, sweat, tears and all of that.\n\n\nOur whole country is on lockdown and last week we exploded. I\u2019ve never had to maneuver and make so many adjustments to our operations in such a short period of time. We\u2019ve held a 5 star rating since opening and I\u2019m hoping that doesn\u2019t get messed up while we expand.\n\n\nWe also don\u2019t price gouge and have specific deals for restaurants with low profit margins. Pay good salaries, insurance, gas and motorbike maintenance for drivers, etc. We\u2019re completely self-funded so it has been an expensive endeavor, but what we offer has landed me some fantastic and loyal staff. Customers, too.\n\n\nThis is a wild time, and I feel very fortunate. I\u2019ve been giving back to the community in various ways but I don\u2019t want to look like I\u2019m patting myself on the back. I will say all of my drivers got much deserved raises two months early and they were pumped though. I also need backup drivers now so I\u2019ve hired some from restaurants we work with who deliver themselves as well on a per-delivery basis to supplement their employees\u2019 income since they\u2019re being paid 75%.\n\n\nDoes anyone else have a company that unexpectedly started thriving because of the virus? What are you doing about it?\n\n\nAre any of you (with companies) able to help in your communities at this time? If so what are you doing?",

Just think, some of your customers maybe can't walk, or their support people might be sick, or they might otherwise rely on a cab that isn't available currently. Replace that weird feeling with a pat on the back for helping people get through this.\n\nIf you have mixed feelings about the profit you're making, perhaps a concession is in order. Partner with certain restaurants to lower your price and their price. The more business you get, the better off you both are, even at a discount, and most importantly, you're reaching more people who might be down on their luck.",

If they won\u2019t I explain why I\u2019m calling and ask them to please have an owner/decision maker call me back and leave my number. If I don\u2019t hear back in a couple of days I call back to check in.\n\n\nMost of the time it\u2019s easy to contact the owner. I usually close on the phone, get their info and menu by email, then go meet in person to sign the agreement we require and launch them that day.\n\n\nSometimes they want to meet first so myself or one of my staff who understands the way I operate and negotiate goes in my place. The best offer we\u2019ll give you is basically based on your menu prices vs profit margins (you\u2019d have two options). I help run a popular \u201cupscale\u201d (food-wise) breakfast cafe so I know what things cost and what people can afford... so occasionally we\u2019ll eat a bit of the cost to save the restaurant money, especially if we think we\u2019ll make up for it in volume.",

So we\u2019re using this as a money grab to buy essentials for staff and give raises that we were planning to pay within two months anyway. All that\u2019s left is to add the expensive bells and whistles to the website and get apps (ready to go already) but we\u2019re only going to do a few things at the moment then finish the bigger picture later. Right now our customers are fine with just the site and it\u2019s all I can afford at the moment anyway.\n\n\nIn the end we will end up with a larger service area and more customers. From experience those costs will cover themselves especially since we don\u2019t have offices. We have a huge demand in other cities that we just haven\u2019t been able to get to for various reasons. Now that all of the kinks have been worked out I know what to expect.\n\n\nOn a side note, we were doing horribly for 1.5 years, then a former partner tried to swindle us in court (they lost) so that blew my operating and marketing budget on lawyer fees. We haven\u2019t put a dime into marketing for almost 2 years. I have separate money coming in for that now finally.\n\n\nBut again, I\u2019m using this opportunity to do the best for my company so I can help others. Once things blow over we\u2019ll have less orders but a bigger name and stronger local relationships I suppose. I\u2019m not as savvy as many people who post here so I just plan as I go.",

    "postText": "Hello fellow Redditors,\r  \n\r  \nI have been approached by some friends with an exciting business idea, and they want me to be the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) responsible for all the technical aspects, including coding and maintaining the website. We have agreed that they will handle everything else, including paperwork, company management, marketing, and covering any fees required to start or maintain the company.\r  \n\r  \nWhile I am enthusiastic about the idea and believe it has great potential, I have some concerns regarding my share in the project and the fairness of the equity distribution.\r  \n\r  \nCurrently, we have agreed on an equity distribution of 20% for me and 40% each for my friends. I will be taking care of the technical work, which I believe will be a significant contribution to the company's success. However, I can't help but feel that my share might not accurately reflect my level of involvement, especially considering the responsibilities and financial commitments I will be taking on.\r  \n\r  \nI would greatly appreciate any advice or insights from the community, especially from those who have experience with equity distribution in startup ventures. How can I ensure a fair distribution of equity that aligns with my responsibilities, given the arrangement we have regarding non-technical tasks and fees?\r  \n\r  \nThank you in advance for your guidance and support. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences.",

            "comment": "This depends heavily on what the company is, but assuming it's something SaaS related, and you're the one actually building the product, 20% is probably too low.\r  \n\r  \nOf the things you mention that the other two co-founders (the ones asking a collective 80% for), paperwork, company management, and \"covering any fees required to start or maintain the company\" are all incredibly small parts of a startup at this stage, and \"marketing\" probably isn't the main focus (outside of product development) either.\r  \n\r  \nBefore you all jump into equity numbers, you should map out what each of the other two founders is responsible for (if their combined responsibility is just \"marketing\" and \"company management\", I wonder how the company benefits from having them both as co-founders), how much time/energy/resources each of them will be devoting in the first 3/6 months, and how much time/effort you will be devoting in the same timeframe. Also map out if/when the company will need additional cash (e.g. to run ads, hire developers, etc), how much it will need, what the money will go to, and how you're going to get it (e.g. are the other founds funding it? Will you seek investment? Who will be responsible for fundraising? Who will be running the pitches?)\r  \n\r  \nMore importantly, make sure you're all aligned on product expectations. It's not uncommon for first-time founders to expect the product to get fully built before they start building an audience and sales pipelines - even thought that's typically a bad move. You don't want to get into a situation where the two of them are basically sitting around waiting for you to build a good product that's comfortable for them to market and sell.",

            "comment": "Hard to say how important the technical part is with the details provided . In general there is no rule how to distribute equity. You could look at what you bring to the table and how important that is for the companies success, but also take into account how much you all will be contributing in the future. Everybody should be ok with the equity distribution tho, if you are already not happy I'd recommend to discuss this with your partners till you have some agreement everybody is ok with. Also keep in mind there might be also other options, like different salary distribution or vacation or a like, but if you believe in the success of your venture then equity is the most valuable.",

            "comment": "20% is too low for this.  Everybody is even, or it doesn\u2019t work.  \n\nPlus, I\u2019d ask them how many potential customers they have interviewed face to face.  Ideas sound great when you are sitting around.  Getting money out of users is what matters.\n\nNext, I\u2019d ask the question of do they understand what an mvp is.  If they don\u2019t, say no, tell them to,go,educate themselves, and comeback after they\u2019ve talked to some users.",

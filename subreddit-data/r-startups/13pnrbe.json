Now I definitely need to do market research, talk to potential users, work on my positioning, and define an MVP...\n\nIf today you'd have to go from where I am to a proper business, what would your game plan be in order?",

            "comment": "These are the major points to work through.\n\nDefine your target market: Clearly identify the specific group of people who are likely to benefit from your product. Understand their demographics, interests, and pain points to refine your target audience.\n\nConduct market research: Gather information about the market landscape, competitors, and potential customers. Identify existing solutions inthe market and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. This will help you position your product effectively.\n\nRefine your value proposition: Clearly articulate the unique value your product offers to customers. Determine how it solves their painpoints, addresses their needs, or offers a significant improvement over existing solutions. This will be the foundation of your messaging.\n\nIdentify potential customers: Reach out to individuals or groups who fit your target market profile. Conduct interviews, surveys, or focus groups to gather feedback on your product concept, understand their requirements, and validate your assumptions.\n\nDevelop a minimum viable product (MVP): Based on the insights gained from market research and customer feedback, prioritize and define the core features required for your MVP. Build a functional version of your product that addresses the key pain points and offers a compelling user experience.\n\nTest and iterate: Launch your MVP to a limited audience of early adopters or beta testers. Gather feedback, measure engagement, and learn from user behavior. Use this data to refine your product, identify necessary improvements, and optimize your user experience.\n\nDevelop a go-to-market strategy: Define your marketing and sales plan. Identify the channels and tactics that will help you reach your target audience effectively. Craft a compelling brand story and messaging that resonates with your customers. Determine your pricing model and distribution strategy.\n\nBuild your team: Assess the skills and expertise you need to scale your business. Determine if you require additional team members or partners to support product development, marketing, sales, or other key functions. Consider hiring or outsourcing as necessary.\n\nScale and iterate: As you gain traction and grow your customer base, continue refining and enhancing your product based on user feedback. Identify opportunities for expansion or diversification in your target market or adjacent markets.\n\nSeek funding (if needed): Evaluate your financial needs and consider seeking external funding, such as angel investors, venture capitalists, or crowdfunding platforms. Prepare a compelling business plan and pitch to attract potential investors.",

I have this issue, heard of content creators having this issue, and based on the number of Fiverr gigs in this exact space it means that there are quite a lot of demands.",

                            "comment": "Off rip this would be my approach:\n- find creators you can trust but would not hold back when providing feedback and share your POC with them - this way you potentially expand your collab portfolio and see if anyone sees your POC like you do\n- ignore Fiver as validation and taste it as a signal - design a landing page MVP, either with users giving their email or paying for, where users can download the POC. Set up ads for free to funnel people to the landing page\n- do a concierge or Wizard of Oz MVP and see if people would pay for either or more\n- set up a system where people can shoot your feedback and respond to it\n\nUse learnings to decide to launch a business or give up. Be wary of advanced video editing software and if you do decide to proceed make sure you differentiate substantially since they can always price gauge you.",

            "comment": "u/scatignaj\r Building a startup game plan involves several key steps to go from an idea to a thriving business. First, validate your idea by conducting market research and identifying target customers' needs. Next, create a solid business plan outlining your value proposition, revenue model, and marketing strategy. Build a minimum viable product (MVP) to test and gather feedback from early adopters. Secure funding by seeking investment or exploring bootstrapping options. Assemble a talented team with diverse skills and shared vision. Develop a scalable product and execute a robust marketing and sales strategy. Continuously iterate based on customer feedback and market dynamics. Prioritize agility, adaptability, and relentless execution to navigate the challenges of startup growth.",

Map your assumptions - What are the riskiest assumptions, the most important ones with least amount of evidence?\n3. Run experiments - Quickly start testing out your riskiest assumptions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI normally don't recommend a POC that early but it makes sense you are solving your own problem with it. Do a bit of search trend analysis on the problem. It's quick and fast and you'll get an idea of how many searches are happening.\n\nRight now you have a hobby, but it could be a business :)",

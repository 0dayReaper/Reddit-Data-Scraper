    "postText": "I started off from a freelancing platform, 5 years ago in the field of Mobile apps development. Flutter came in and I started learning it. Little did I knew that I would get to have so many opportunities during COVID.\n\nAs everyone was sitting at home, there was a huge boom in social media usage. A big number of people, wanted to develop mobile apps but these were the people who were individuals but quite energetic. I loved the spark and how wholeheartedly, all of us worked together.\n\nBeing young and coming from Pakistan, where I never knew had a surrounding of tech friends and I had never been to a job.\nI realised that I was building MVPs for people and I came to this realisation in late 2020 after I collaborated with a Startup.\n\nHere\u2019s the interesting part, I came around this client during late 2022 where he wanted me and my network to make a MVP for a particular module of his ecosystem.\n\nWe built it and to our surprise the product did really well. \n\nAt this point, he\u2019s my client. I was assigned to do work and I completed the job.\n\nMoving forward, we used to have multiple meetings and somehow we became a bit comfortable with each other.\n\nI knew at this point that he was looking for a development company and he was being quoted quite a hefty amount about 250k for building the platform and handing it over with some other conditions as well.\n\nI saw the opportunity and I pitched him one day about hiring a team over here in Pakistan and building the whole platform.\n\nI did the maths and shared that we can run the development  over here for a whole year for 5-6 times less than the quoted amount.\n\nWe talked over it and he was quite convinced that we should do it.\n\n5 months back, we started the development and we have made big time progress on the whole platform. During this period, I\u2019ve tremendously helped in development as well as business development side.\n\nI wanted to ask about my role and can I ask for the equity? i don\u2019t want to make it awkward and make him feel worried. I\u2019m someone whose more interested in connecting the dots and making something big then ruining or limiting the potential by being direct.  I just want to hear thoughts of the community. I\u2019m someone who has really good ethical values and I always think a lot before saying something to anyone. \n\nI would appreciate if you could help me in clarifying things and guide me in the right direction.\n\n\nP.S\n\nI\u2019ve been wanting to ask this question for a really long time. Ive been part of this sub for a while and I wanted to ask on how do people see hiring a dedicated team for their startup from overs seas. T wouldn\u2019t it be great if you get to have a dedicated team which could increase your  runway and allow you to have higher control over the expenditure and marketing side.",

            "comment": "IMO it wouldn\u2019t make sense to ask for equity. They paid you for your time to build an MVP and now the platform. If you agreed upfront on a reduced rate in exchange for equity or profit sharing it would be one thing. But charging your  normal rate and then asking for equity only after the product is successful wouldn\u2019t be a good look. If you think the product has a bright future you could offer some kind of reduced rate going forward in exchange for equity maybe?",

You got paid for your work. You took no risk. So no substantial equity should be expected.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, that moving forward, you have a very good case to negotiate for equity or equity options. It would secure your long term commitment and align your interests. If you present this in the right way, your client might be really pleased.\n\nBut you\u2019re probably only talking about &lt; 2% in options, if you are still taking full payment for the dev work.\n\nIf the client has invested his own money for this MVP, you could maybe negotiate substantial equity and become a founder if you start working for equity instead of cash.",

As a former service provider I have had clients offer equity to lower the effective costs of ongoing development. I've also had clients ask me to join them in their startup. \n\nIf you want to keep running a service business and you're willing to discount the services price then asking for equity can be a negotiating tactic to give you that option. \n\nIf you want to join the startup then offering to join the startup and bring your experience and expertise can give the founder the option to hire you with a combination cash/equity package. \n\nI'd say either option may be possible if you align with the founder on long-term goals.",

I\u2019d be a minority stakeholder without any real say in the decisions. If I see something going off the rails, there\u2019s little I could do other than say something about it and give advice. And, truth be told, startup founders aren\u2019t the greatest at taking advice; they already have demonstrated enough hubris to think they know what\u2019s going on better than whoever their last employer was. \n\nBetter to diversify and nab more clients with the success of the one. That\u2019ll pay you more, more quickly, and be an investment in your future that isn\u2019t reliant on the decision making of someone you don\u2019t control.",

You would likely need to give something in return, like a reduced development rate: if you really believe in the company, you might ask for 80% of your future compensation to be in cash, and 20% in equity, for instance.

You take a risk with offshore labor in exchange for lower rates. That\u2019s not discounting. \n\n2) Contractor relationships transform all the time.

    "postText": "Hello, I'm currently a financially-strapped medical student with several product ideas unrelated to my field. While I'm passionate and willing to take risks to turn these ideas into a business, I lack the necessary knowledge, expertise, and resources to develop them. I'm also new to the business world and despite my busy schedule, I'm ready to dedicate as much time as possible to get started.\r  \n\r  \nI understand the stakes are high and I'm eager to avoid unnecessary failures. I'm here seeking your advice and strategies on how to navigate this journey. How can I begin turning these ideas into a viable business? What are the essential steps I should take? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

I don't know anything about flying or space, but it seems neat.\"  There is no free lunch. You need to study and learn a particular field, then use your knowledge to find partners or study how to build a business. I suggest working for a decade or two, and keep talking to people about those ideas. Alternatively, you can try and start the business and continue learning medicine, burn yourself out, waste a ton of money, and learn a bit faster.",

Ideally, choose customers in an area where you are an expert, and you have a passion. Then, before you figure out what your product would do, you should go talk to those target customers and listen carefully to their problems. See if you can find a way to solve their problems, and then go talk to them again and ask them if you are proposed solution would be useful. Do all of this before building anything. Focusing on your customers is the best way to learn.",

How to make money out of the problem you're solving?\n5. Is there enough demand for what you're solving?\n\nPick any business. All of them answer these fundamental questions. \n\nSo instead of thinking 'what business you can start around your passion', **think 'what problem I can solve for people'**.

DM me if you would like to discuss the these products. We have sales, we have some production, we have Ai.

You will here a TON of stories from founders that build cool PROFITABLE startups with nothing (mostly). It will give you an idea of what is possible, what others did to achieve their own dreams, and be very inspirational.\n2. Learn to Code. I have zero idea what your \"product ideas\" are, but if you know how to code the world opens up for you and you can actually build things that will achieve your product needs or help you get in front of others to sell it or a number of other useful things for building a startup. Start by learning web development with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and some backend like PHP. Follow Brad Traversy on Youtube and code along with his tutorials to build simple projects and learn the basics. Don't spend TOO long learning to code. Just get the fundamentals, then build your ideas. Use Google and ChatGPT to answer your questions and continue to build.\n\nJust these two things alone can propel you to getting closer to starting your products.\n\nWill these 2 things be ALL you need to build a startup and succeed? ABSOLUTELY NOT! But they will give you a good starting point, mindest, and tools to help you move forward.",

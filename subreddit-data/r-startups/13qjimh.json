    "postText": "We started a service company and we are close to get our first client , we need to build an app (backend + mobile app) to solve some internal logistic issues for this company , the app is not too complex , we are making them sign a contract so both parties are aware of the requirements and there is a clear beginning and end to the development , what we are not sure if how much to charge them , we have some rough estimations but we want to be competitive, i\u2019m aware this is a common issue, is there a somewhat reliable way of calculating a reasonable price ? any recommendations on how to approach this ? our current estimation only for the development is around 25k USD , this is for a company located in Europe",

            "comment": "Are you really close to signing contracts when the client doesn\u2019t even know how much it\u2019s going to cost them? \n\nIn any case couple of things to consider. \n1. What margins would you typically operate at? If you are spending X on something. Are you looking to make 2X out of it. \n2. How much money you are saving your client. If your solution saves 2 Million each year for a client. They\u2019ll be happy to pay you 200k. If it saves them 10k ; and you ask them for 25k. They\u2019ll not do it. \n3. Are these custom apps for each client or can multiple folks use the same app/backend. If so, you can think about how many actual customers you can get and maybe split Dev costs\nAcross these clients.",

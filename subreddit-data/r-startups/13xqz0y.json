I'm neither, and as such can't participate in your form.\n\n2) If I'm living in a house that I'm selling, and a realtor brings prospective buyers through that steal something from my house, that realtor is insured and I have some level of recourse (including that realtor losing their license).  There's no way I would allow randos off the street to enter my house (even with your cameras watching).  Talk to realtors about the *horror stories* related to realtors or prospective buyers about theft, etc.\n\n3) If I'm living in a house while I sell it, I would never put a camera controlled by someone else on my front stoop, much less than through every room in my house.  Without cameras covering every inch of my house, we're back to #2 (above)",

            "comment": "So, a seller, or the seller's real estate agent, would be your target customer, right?\n\nThere are strong financial incentives for most sellers in the US to use real estate agents. \"For sale by owner\" is extremely uncommon; almost all sellers are using real estate agents.\n\nReal estate agents charge a flat % of the sales price as a fee, so even if your product eliminates the need for some labor, it's not actually saving the seller any money - a seller's agent will cost the same with or without your product. So the seller has no incentive to use your product.\n\nAnd the seller's *agent* has no incentive to use your product either. The way house showings normally work is: the seller's agent just leaves a lockbox at the property, and if a potential buyer wants to tour the property, the buyer's agent has access to the lockbox and gives them the tour. The *seller's agent* doesn't actually have to do any work for the tour to happen.\n\nSo even if your product eliminates the need for the buyer's agent to be there, that doesn't benefit the seller's agent at all.\n\nSo why should the seller or their agent buy your product? Neither of them benefit from it compared to doing things the traditional way.\n\nEDIT: I just looked at your website and realized you're actually trying to cut real estate agents completely out of the picture and run your own alternative marketplace? That's even tougher. Licensed real estate agents basically have a housing marketplace monopoly due to a combination of network effects and regulatory capture.\n\nIf I want to sell my property at market price, I want to get it listed on the MLS, because that's where almost all buyers directly or indirectly find the properties they buy. And getting it listed on the MLS means having to use a real estate agent. And if I use a real estate agent, then using your marketplace is kind of pointless.\n\nAlso, most buyers use buyers' agents. And buyers' agents get paid by the seller. A buyer's agent is going to do everything in their power to try to stop their clients from buying a house that's not being sold via a seller's agent, because if that happens, the buyer's agent won't get paid.\n\nSo if I try to sell without a seller's agent, I'm basically eliminating most prospective buyers.",

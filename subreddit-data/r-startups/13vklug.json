I've built a survey to collect some information essential for me to get an idea of the scope and market for such a product - https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_9FF6d1yXGbrizVI  \nPlease respond to the survey. It will take under 5 minutes! It would help me a great deal.  \nAlso, if you have any ideas off the bat, leave those in the comments please!  \nThanks!",

The only valuable consulting I\u2019ve seen is very knowledgeable topic experts. General &amp; strategy consulting is very broad and our approach is to be the smartest guy in the room, get your business, then spend 1-3 months actually learning what the real problem is so we can sell the client another engagement.\n\nMost of strategy consulting is listening to the front line and then bringing those data points to upper management along with some \u201canalysis\u201d we\u2019ve cobbled together to show that it would make a tangible impact to the bottom line.\n\nA start up doesn\u2019t need that. There are no striated barriers between the people who make decisions and the ones who are impacted by it. What you need is a mentor who has already tackled the issues you are about to face. Preferably a mentor who is affordable as well and not taking all your starting cash/equity. Look into SCORE mentors in your area. It\u2019s part of the SBA and is a seriously discounted/free service.

YMMV, but we get all our clients by word-of-mouth referrals because our focus is on their results, not our sales. The two are without a doubt directly correlated",

As a novice it\u2019s very difficult for you to know the difference between someone 10% better than you and someone 90% better than you. The 10% better person might be better at telling you what you want to hear than the 90% person can.\n\nYou can still learn from the 10% better person. Coaching will accelerate you as long as you\u2019re learning. Once you start to plateau, it\u2019s time for a different coach. \n\nEvery firm will have consultants with different levels of effectiveness. There are some independent coaches who will be a better fit than what you find at a firm.",

There are many big ERP-like players in the market but all the small/medium size operators are still using paper logbooks. Logbookr will be the first web and iOS logbook app.\n\nThe app is very dead simple to make, imagine if every time you drove your car you recorded where you went, when you left/arrived, your oil temperature, oil pressure, etc. You must also record if anything on the car broke on your trip, and what was done to fix it. The app must also show when your next service is due (so you don't drive longer than that). That's it.\n\n* **More details:**\n   * What life cycle stage is your startup at? \n\nI have built the MVP in appsheet, just working on payment integration now and we will be ready to launch. \n\n* Your role?\n\nOne man show. I am an executive in the airline industry building this on the side for my company but in a way that I can sell it to all the others like mine that I know need something like this.\n\n* **What goals are you trying to reach this month?**\n\nAppsheet has been amazing to build the MVP but I have some big decisions to make before building the alpha version. Another no-code plaform or from scratch? Hire a firm or manage freelancers myself? Find a cofounder? \n\n* **Discount for** [**r/startup**](https://www.reddit.com/r/startup/) **subscribers?**\n\nIf by chance anyone here works in the airline industry I will happily give you a free subscription to try.",

We've built our own remote desktop software using cutting-edge tech such as GPU-accelerated video encoding and a custom UDP-based networking protocol. Ultimately, it makes our product more responsive (lower latency) and have better visual quality, higher FPS, etc. Also, we manage the virtualization layer ourselves, which allows us to build out features that deliver better price for performance. Both of these areas are really challenging to compete in.\n\n2. **Software partnerships**:\nThis is a cool idea and something we will continue to explore. We're already an Autodesk partner and we'll continue to build other partnerships.\n\n3. **Cost of hardware going down**: With 3D workloads, there's almost always more complexity to add. More lighting simulations, more complex models, etc. Even if powerful hardware becomes cheap, we still help on the dimensions of not needing maintenance, remote accessibility, etc. Cheaper hardware reduces our costs too.\n\nThanks again!",

In fact, live videos hold users\u2019 attention 10-20x longer than pre-recorded, on-demand content.\n\nCambit is a live streaming platform where sellers can engage with buyers to enable scalable commerce.\n\nThe traditional e-commerce experience is highly focused towards intentional buying (I want something, I go to Amazon, I press buy). Live engagement between buyers and sellers not only enables unintentional buying but makes intentional buying more exciting and engaging (think of as going to the mall, enquiring about products with store owners, and then buying the product straight from your phone).",

Modern technology (that keeps getting better each year) like camera quality, 5G, social media presence, and mobile connectivity allows sellers to monitize their products in a new way (new form of engagement with customers) which could potentially increase their sales.\n\nAmazon is a great but it's kinda \"boring\". You just look at images and search for products on your own. Live shopping will allow greater engagement (since it's live) and hopefully a more entertaining way to shop (for buyers) all while providing a new channel to increase sales.",

The sweet spot will be customers that are most burdened by the inefficiencies, errors, and labor costs associated with doing cash flow modeling in excel.  These are the companies that have leaner teams (either 1-2 analyst or higher ups doing all their modeling).  They know that they need sophisticated DCF models for legitimacy and either put up w/ excel or use a more expensive enterprise solution (like an Argus).\n\nThe value proposition is that MW places itself as an easier, efficient and less error-prone than Excel BUT remains the flexibility to create sophisticated analysis (something many competitors struggle with)...all at a price point that is acceptable for enterprise or retail users.\n\nI currently do lots of consulting for PE investors and developers.  A large portion of my services is analytical modeling in excel.  So, I am trying to put myself out of a job =)",

Your value proposition seems strong and it sounds like you\u2019ve proved the value it creates for your target customer.\n\nOnce you start to grow the existing players will try to copy what you\u2019ve built so I can only add to plan to protect your competitive advantage through patents or by just moving really fast.\n\nGood luck!

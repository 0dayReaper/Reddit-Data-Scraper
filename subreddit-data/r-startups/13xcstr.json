Will make a post soon.\n\nI looked into Usertesting but right now their pricing starts at $7k a year, a lot more than I m looking for.  WIll look out for others.  \n\nI had it listed but had to modify some DNS settings and forgot to re-list with google!  Thanks for pointing that out.  Should be back up there in a day or two.",

I wonder if you'd mind if I made a suggestion or two?\n\nYou say that the webapp isn't getting many repeat users, so determining where they stop in the process is important. If you can figure out how to send feedback data to yourself that would be the key (I'm assuming you don't already do this). You need to be able to look at a 'map' of what your users are doing in your app. Where they go and in what order they go in. I don't know what dev environment you use, but there should be a way to log what users do and they create spreadsheets to analyze their path.\n\nIf you want any community help, post up the webapp and myself and some other people on here can open it up and use it to see if we see any issues or have any recommendations.\n\nAnyway just some suggestions, otherwise good luck! Cheers!",

I am working on tracking that more consistently but your point is well taken that I need to make that a priority and improve it.    \n\n\nI would love any feedback.  The app is [www.cephadex.com](https://www.cephadex.com) \n\nAnd I appreciate all criticisim :-D.  I know the front end also needs a lot of work as does the landing page.",

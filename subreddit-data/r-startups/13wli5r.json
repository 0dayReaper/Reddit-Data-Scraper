    "postText": "Is there an app for finding small cap companies easily? For example, I might be looking for healthtech companies gone public within the last 2 years. Is there an app which would answers to such queries?\n\nI'm thinking of creating such an app using AI, where you can explore smaller relatively unknown companies easily using a ChatGPT like interface. The app would know all the publicly available details about all the public companies.\n\nDo you guys see any value in this? Would you pay a small monthly subscription to have access to this app? Which features would you love to have in this app?",

But if you're just exploring and want to discover stocks according to your criteria, they don't have that feature I believe.\n\nDo you think the discovery feature is something investors will be willing to pay for?",

            "comment": "Let's see. I think that the general success of this idea will highly depend on the correct implementation of the product itself. If we assume that the target audience of this application is *investors who are interested in investing in small businesses*, then I would place a very strong accent on the trustworthiness of the product itself. It seems to me that it is not enough to collect information for investing with the help of Chat GPT. But if the app could **find a company's financial statements and analyze them**, and if you could go even go further and give it the ability to correlate market trends, that would be a game changer.\n\nSuppose I were offered to come up with some features for the application. As a user, I would be interested in knowing the **amount of investment** this company has received, perhaps even from whom. I'm not sure if this monetization strategy suits you. I would make it free, with the ability to receive unique information and insights already in a paid subscription.\n\nIn general, I like your idea, and I would be glad to try something like this. Anyways, good luck!",

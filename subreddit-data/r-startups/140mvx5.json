    "postText": "I quit my job in March 2022, spent the past year launching an olive oil brand solo full-time (no salary). Now I'm looking to expand. I am currently selling and delivering product in the Validation / Efficiency Stage\n\n**Primary need is sales / marketing**\n\n1. Should I seek a cofounder or interns / employees?\n2. Should I look for a cofounder or investors first?\n3. Debt or Equity? I have some runway but I'm constantly thinking about money (definitely getting in the way)\n\nHappy to hear any input",

I'm guessing you're buying the oil in bulk and reselling it locally.\n\n But what's your next step? Are you really ready to hire more employees?  Or do you need more orders first?\n\nOlive oil is a pretty saturated market so unless you're delivering something unique or more affordable it may be difficult to scale up. I would focus on what you want the business to look like in 5 years,  and try to get some local grants/funding to get you there if money is tight. \n\nI know a local Olive oil company that buys in bulk then infuses their Olive oil with anything you can imagine. They team up with local restaurants or you can go into the store and fill up on any of the multiple infused oils. It's a really neat business model. They also offer infused balsamic vinegars.",

We have some programs funded by the municipality that will help you build your entire business plan and fund you along the way during each stage of launching and scaling.\n\nMost people don't take advantage of the resources around them,  and I think it's mostly because they just don't know what's out there. Cities want/need businesses to grow and succeed and will often go above and beyond to get you there. \n\nGood luck!",

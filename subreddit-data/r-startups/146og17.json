We have group of about 5 people working on an app, one is doing the code and the other 1 is brainstorming ideas, creating the designs etc, while I do some research on who will use the app. Everyone else is not doing anything :(.\n\nProblem:\n\nThe original problem the app is going to solve is already solved by an existing website.\n\nThe key feature differences between our app and the website(keep in mind our app has not been built yet)\n\n* we are an app therefore be able to push notifications\n* we will offer features that the website does not have\n* the website has way more content on it, enough that we won't be able to compete at that level\n\nThe other believe that the quality of life features will make our app different from the existing website.\n\nI was suggesting a broader problem to cover, however that leads to a website being more favorable over an app. I still need to do some more research about the problem, that enough people suffer from this issue that a service is necessary?\n\nProblem 2:\n\nthere are a lot of feature being suggested, how do I figure out that these feature will be useful to our users. Also, how does a leaderboard work in terms of motivation, especially for the average user?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSincerely and thank you,\n\nA high school student",

I am not talking about asking friends if they think it\u2019s a cool idea (to which most people will say \u00ab\u00a0yes\u00a0\u00bb anyhow because they are your friends). I am talking about profound customer interviews about what you suspect is their problem. You have a hypothesis what the problem is but you have to validate that problem with many customers. They might confirm your hypothesis or they might say that they already use yelp (or some other app) and are happy. They might point you to a completely different problem which you can then solve. \n\nI would highly recommend going on youtube and watch some videos on lean startup and customer interviews. \n\nAt the end of this process you should have a pretty good idea what the market needs and already have paying customers (some of the ones you interviewed). The best thing is that this process is free and increases your chances to succeed immensely. \n\nEdit: added some stuff for clarity",

Definitely more than 10 and try to diversify the people you are talking to (of course they should be relevant to the market you are targeting). This will help you understand better what your customers want and to pivot/tailor your solution to fit those needs. \nWhen I hear stories from successful startups they recall having conducted more than 100 customer interviews.\nKnowing your customer is definitely one of the most important things, if not the most!",

It's hard to compete with big companies on serving large groups of people better but say if you make the absolute best app for shopping around for car parts in New Jersey then you should be able to create a better experience than yelp for that niche, then as you grow, you start to serve other niches well too. So you end up as a broad company later but initially you focus super narrow. \n\nTry to get people you don't know to sign up to a waitlist after you pitch them. If get 1 in 20 or more of your target market from people you don't know, then you might have something. If it's paid then you need 1 in 20 to verbally commit to buying it at the price you want.\n\nThen market size is pretty simple: whatever success rate you achieve in converting people x total number of people exactly like the group you're converting with x price of product / ad revenue per person. This is your market size, then you subtract the costs to serve that many people. If that looks big enough that you could then expand to the next group, then the market is big enough",

The reason I want to broaden is not only because we can get more people to sign up for the app, but also another website exists which is already a website like yelp only for Mexican restaurants. The difference between our app and the website is we will have quality of life features like\n\n* easy reservation making (integrated)\n* easy takeout ordering (integrated)\n* see what food review guides gave the restaurants\n\nI feel that these features will not be enough to get people to use our app over website since the existing website has a much bigger selection of Mexican restaurants that already exist, I want to broaden it so people will use ours for other cuisines, and just because they have the app, end up also using it for Mexican restaurants.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

Is there anyway you could get the student council or the counselors to allow you to push it to the student body.  Maybe your school district could use it to document student volunteers.  I know some school districts have a volunteer hour requirement.  Could you offer something so that parents could monitor their kids hours.  You could provide a report to the school on the hours completed. Once it blessed off by the school, other organizations might be more wiling to sign up for it.",

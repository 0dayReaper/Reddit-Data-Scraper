What services do you use?  How do I get started with a website and an email account?  Please help I feel so overwhelmed!\n\n*Edit: I am starting a disability consulting and advocacy company.  We will be having workshops on diagnosis, services, IEP services, and employee/employer disability  accomodations consulting.",

            "comment": "If you are building a knowledge worker or customer service centric company, do not muddle website and email. There are three mutually exclusive things: domain name and the dns function, email services, and web hosting. \n\nAssuming you handled domain reg\u2026. Your future business is likely to benefit most from Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace.  Your email services are likely going to become the core identity system for users.   The choice is harder than you think but realistically should be one of the two.  It is likely to be the stickiest thing you do. \n\nAfter that, web is very much flexible and should be modular and disposable. If I were doing web for a new project I would leverage no-code platforms that do more than a website, for instance SofR. However, as a non-tech person that may be difficult to grasp.\n\nFinally, consider professional help. Someone who can understand your vision and where the company may be in 5 years and start the little seeds that can grow.  Your setup will be simple today but if it\u2019s not scalable it\u2019s not a business.",

There are super simple website building platforms with nice templates like Squarespace/Wix/etc. There are also more powerful/customizable platforms like WordPress.\n\nEmail, gmail/microsoft office are probably two of the biggest. Some of the places you setup your website also might have email provided or through partners (often one of those 2).",

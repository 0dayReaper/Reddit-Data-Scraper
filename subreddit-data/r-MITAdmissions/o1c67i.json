            "comment": "It would be bold but growing is still a felony rn so I'd recommend against saying you are cultivating cubes. I would definitely include your interest in mycology somewhere in the app though as it's really cool and unique, you could just say you grow gourmets or do microscopy with cube spores.",

You could bypass the risk and preserve the mycology on your app by saying you grow gourmets. In the end do what you feel is best. I'm curious to know what you decide and if you'll get admitted. Good luck and happy cultivating pal.",

            "comment": "IMHO you are asking the wrong question.\n\nMIT Admissions tells you a lot about how to prepare:\n\n[https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/highschool/](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/highschool/)\n\n[https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/be-yourself/](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/be-yourself/)\n\n[https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/enrichment/](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/enrichment/)\n\n[https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying\\_sideways/](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying_sideways/)\n\n[https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/what-we-look-for/](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/what-we-look-for/)\n\nThere's a lot of information out there (MITAdmissions, College Confidential, Quora, etc.)\n\n[https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/stats/](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/stats/)\n\n[https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/profile/](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/profile/)\n\nWhat I can also say is:\n\n* the median student at MIT was salutatorian in high school (over 40% valedictorian, another third salutatorian, every person in the top 10% if ranked) -- **they are excellent students** (i.e., not just good in one field and mediocre in the rest). Like if one is not in the top few students of one's high school and one is not the top STEM student, one should rethinking applying to MIT.\n* they love STEM\n* they challenge themselves academically/in the classroom as well as outside the classroom\n* every person among the top American universities has self-studied something, whether that's a single topic that's fascinated them or was really into a language or culture or music theory/music history or college-level STEM\n* they will contribute to the MIT community (i.e., anyone within an internet connection can view youtube videos or do Khan Academy or download from OCW or do edX -- or read books). Obviously MIT being a private university is looking for leaders who will organize and lead various clubs and organizations. I believe it's usually around 500 clubs/associations/organizations so the undergraduate students to clubs ratio is relatively low compared to a lot of other universities.\n* Extracurriculars really vary. A lot of applicants do either or both team sports and/or music. However, do what really interests you. (I usually say you should do three types of extracurriculars: the first is what really interests you, the second type makes you a better person \\[e.g., public speaking, more precise thinker, etc.\\], and the third type is philanthropic -- these should contribute to your community/town/city/etc. Even a part-time job is an extracurricular.)\n* you demonstrate really good fit with MIT. I can't stress this enough. Just because an applicant likes one STEM discipline and is a good student does NOT make this person a good fit for MIT. Just because another applicant kind of likes math and is good does not make this person a good fit. You should know why MIT is a good fit for you as well as why you are a good fit for MIT. (Hint: think about history, traditions, culture, values.)",

    "postText": "I\u2019m not even in college yet but I was wondering what it takes to get into graduate school at MIT. I apologize if this is a question that\u2019s asked often, I\u2019m not very familiar with this sub. \n\nI\u2019m a junior in high school who had a terrible year partly due to many extenuating circumstances and don\u2019t have very impressive academic or extracurricular qualities. Because of this, I decided that I won\u2019t be applying to MIT for undergrad. I\u2019m trying my luck with UMASS Amherst, hoping to get in for computer science. I actually doubt I\u2019ll be getting into UMASS Amherst, but that\u2019s besides the point. When I\u2019m in college,  what should I try and focus on to have the best chances of getting into graduate school at MIT? I understand that there isn\u2019t really anything that defines whether someone will get in or not, but I\u2019m really just looking for what makes someone stand out more compared to others. And once again, I apologize if this is a reposted question, and I\u2019ll appreciate any and all responses.",

            "comment": "For graduate school, the specific lab or advisor you work under is much more important than the ranking of the overall school. Depending on what you're interested in, attending MIT for grad school may not be the best school to attend. For example, I attended MIT for undergrad, but wanted to focus on aircraft flight mechanics for graduate school. MIT doesn't do very much of that at the graduate level, so it wouldn't have made sense for me to stay. \n\nIn general, graduate admissions is going to care about research experience, GPA, letters of recommendation, GRE score, and your application essays.",

I\u2019m interested in AI and HCI so I\u2019ll do some research on those subjects for my decision to see if MIT is a good graduate school to attend. I\u2019ll also have to figure out more about the research stuff, I\u2019ve heard from other people that it\u2019s important too.",

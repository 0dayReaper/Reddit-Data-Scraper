The purpose of the practice is to prevent reductions in yield; a statistic that reflects the proportion of students that accept their admissions offer.An alternate view holds that yield protection is a myth propagated by students who failed to gain admission to an academic institution.**\n\nMore details here: &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_protection&gt; \n\n\n\n*This comment was left automatically (by a bot).

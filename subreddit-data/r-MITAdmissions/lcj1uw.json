    "postText": "Hey Everybody, I'm a second-year student at a top international engineering school and I'm thinking of applying at MIT. I was hoping for some general advice to get a good application like what kind of work experience, internships, SoP &amp; LoR tips, GRE scores etc. Right now I have a 3.7 GPA and am thinking of applying in the Aerospace Engineering field.\n\nAny help is appreciated!",

            "comment": "GRE scores aren't going to matter a whole lot as long as you meet the requirements. The biggest advice I could give would be to look at what research is being done at MIT, narrow down what you'd be interested in doing, and then try to get classes and research positions focused on that. With research positions, your end goal is publications and stellar letters of rec from respected people in the field. If by the time you apply you are able to get in touch with a specific PI and tell them \"here's what I'd like to do in your lab, here's what I've done to prepare for that specific research, and here's proof that I can do it (publications, letters of rec)\", that will go a long way.",

What if I\u2019m interested in making art and doing physics but MIT only likes those who win National/International Gold Medals, do a summer program at Boston Dynamics, do 1345 hours of community service and eat numbers for breakfast, lunch and dinner. \nCuz if you just admit this, it will be easier for all us cuz then we\u2019d also try to do this stuff (according to our abilities).",

Passion is a big thing at MIT, but success is important as well. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty easy for them to know what opportunities you\u2019ve had. The previous poster made the absolute most of what was available to them - but someone in a more privileged school or background with the same activities wouldn\u2019t have gotten in. \n\nMy son got in early action, almost straight As, a national level athletic recruit, international music awards, community service awards, state wide engineering awards, and a national merit scholar while taking sophomore college level math classes while attending an intercity urban high school. \n\nI am proud of him, and we did help him significantly - but there is no way he could have done all that without significant passion and dedication. \n\nAnd despite all those achievements, I doubt he would have been accepted if he wasn\u2019t a very strong athlete. Getting into MIT is near impossible these days.",

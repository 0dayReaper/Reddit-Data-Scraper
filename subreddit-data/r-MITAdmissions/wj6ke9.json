            "comment": "If accepted as a transfer, the university would assess the credits earned at the old university and decide which, if any, of those credits will transfer. So it's possible to transfer with a full year of credit. It's equally possible to be given less than a full year of credit. How those credits are applied to the graduation requirements will vary by university",

    "postText": "Right now, I'm on track for completing my pre-engineering associate in science degree through my state's dual enrollment program (senior next year). I have a 4.0 gpa, and I'll have taken math through linear algebra and multivariable calc by the time I graduate, but I'm not sure how this is going to compare to having taken AP/IB classes throughout high school (since my high school doesn't offer any), so I was wondering if anyone here had applied with similar coursework. Mostly, I'm just worried that exams like the ACT will still be taken into account, and since I ended up getting a 32 (did not go as planned, to say the least) and don't know if I'll be able to take it with COVID-19 restrictions, I'm afraid that my score will end up disqualifying me even before admissions counselors see my coursework.",

Your exam will obviously be taken into account - everything will be - to create a unique picture of you as a student. They will also account, if you tell them, for the disruption that Covid has caused, and there\u2019s a good chance there will be much less emphasis on tests that have been virtualized. \n\nSo long as your grades are within an acceptable range (with a cutoff much lower than a 32), the most important part of your application is the essays. The odds are never in your favor, but that\u2019s the nature of admissions here.",

    "postText": "I got deferred from MIT in the EA this year and started searching up online for what could be done to improve my chances. One of those things is sending a letter of continued interest, however on [this MIT FAQ website](https://mitadmissions.org/pages/ea-deferred-faq/) it says the you \"DON'T\" have to let them know im interested. Now the question is, should i adhere to what they say and not send an loci or since they said I don't \"HAVE\" to, ill send one anyway?\n\n\n\n\n Am I overthinking this? Maybe lmao",

Also, in that letter you\u2019re probably going want to include any new accomplishments, but we have that FUN form in mid January that is meant for updates. I feel like a LOI might be annoying to them, at best it will be redundant but at worst they will take it that you can not follow instructions.",

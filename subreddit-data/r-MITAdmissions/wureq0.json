            "comment": "Hi... Some of you know me from other sites (although I post under other names).\n\nI've run the stats.\n\nAIME is \"nice,\" net slight positive, but not formidable. Obviously it's nice because you're in the top 5% including against 12th graders.\n\nSome people used to think that until about a decade ago, USAMO qualifiers (which as you know is like among the top AIME+AMCx scores) were like around 90% to be admitted, but I can attest that this percentage is much lower now.\n\nEven IMO gold medalists, in 2015, the MIT Admissions person said that they could not admit as many or even more than they admitted, so that means IMO gold medalists are &lt;= 50%.\n\nThat being said, if you represent the United States in an international competition (IPhO, IChO, IMO, IOI, IBO), especially before you apply, MIT knows about you and will try to recruit you (at least into applying). I've mentioned before that I happened to be at the admissions office and discussing Jason D. Lu when the AO pulled out a package that was going to get sent to him. If you've researched MIT Admissions, you know that some AO attends various International Science Olympiads and they're on top of a bunch of American (national) ones.\n\nAs you also may know, I like to keep a short list of \"people that I think have formidable chances\" and I've predicted various people in the past (Benjamin Qi, Thomas Guo, Victor Rong, William Zhao, Arthur D. Hu, Luke R. Robitaille).\n\nIt's really not a secret: if I come across a digital trail where you are national level in multiple STEM disciplines (e.g., USABO Honorable Mention, USAPhO gold, USACO Camp, MOP, etc.) and I look for evidences of leadership and social skills (and I don't have access to your grades or coursework as I do not work for MIT Admissions), then I suspect you have really good chances. \n\nAnd it's not just limited to olympiads. It is certainly holistic. MIT Admissions considers many factors. One young man that I thought had strong chances was really good at programming and never did USACO. He built a messaging platform within Amazon and Amazon tried to offer him and his teammate internships only to realize the two were 16 years old. He went weekly to the Stata Center to interact with professors and students and to listen to the latest CS/ML/AI research. As a result of this networking, he got a summer job working on Autism-related Emotional Outburst Detection and Mitigation software and this was his proudest achievement. There were several other things on his profile (most advanced math+CS student at a top 20 US private school, president of computer club, etc.) (He was admitted)\n\nEven as an interviewer, there are definitely telltail signs that someone would be a great fit for MIT.\n\nEA is a bit weird in that there's a lot of self-selection so it's not quite comparing apples-to-apples when you're looking at EA vs. RA numbers. The people we get for EA tend to be more sure they want to go to MIT and MIT is their top choice if not one of the top choices -- obviously if one were ethical, one cannot apply to REA/SCEA schools if one applies to MIT. Applicants also tend to have their grades+scores already in the right range (as opposed to trying to improve these in the November-December timeframe).",

If you\u2019re applying from Bay Area where every Asian down the street has qualified for the AIME then it won\u2019t do much, but if you\u2019re coming from Georgia (like me) or from a place where national math comps aren\u2019t the norm then it can give a considerable boost.",

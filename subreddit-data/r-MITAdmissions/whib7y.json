            "comment": "I'm not in the admissions office but my theory is that projects or leadership that show your own passion and interests make a real difference. MIT doesn't have a lot of structure, so students that show independent drive and self-organization will be more likely to succeed there. Demonstrating intelligence and doing well in school is a pre-requisite but I'd recommend also finding things that show your interests in independent work, projects, leadership, or similar. Something(s) that you care about, that is not part of your school structure.  \n\n\nSo building upon the electronics you've been learning on youtube, can you think of projects that would solve real problems that you care about that you could follow through with all the way to completion, even when it gets hard? What would get you inspired to work on?",

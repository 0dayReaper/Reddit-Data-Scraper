    "postText": "I\u2019ve taken ap calculus AB, but self studied for the BC exam and got a 5. My high school doesn\u2019t offer either of the physics C exams, but I self studied for those and got 4\u2019s. I\u2019ve taken AP bio, but I\u2019ve only taken 1 semester of AP chemistry because I was sitting in on some university classes, one of them being a graduate level mathematical physics class, and I wanted to focus on the class. I\u2019m currently taking upper division math courses at my local university. Will this be a problem?\n\nAlso, my extra curriculars are lacking. My school doesn\u2019t have many clubs, so I can\u2019t really put anything there. I also lack distinctions because there are few opportunities for them. I have participated in several varsity sports, and was an all state musician. I will be getting an internship at very large tech company in a few weeks. I\u2019ve done a research internship at my local university focusing on electrodynamics and semiconductor physics. I worked another job last winter. I competed in mock trial. I\u2019m a member of NHS and a musical volunteering organization. \n\nI don\u2019t have any distinctions, but I\u2019m optimistic I\u2019ll get good letters of recommendation.\n\nI\u2019ve taught myself Python programming, and I\u2019ve watch many online MIT OCW courses to teach my self math and physics. I play the piano and lift weights as a hobby. I\u2019ve also sat  in on several upper division courses at my local university, and I completed all the assignments for the the class.\n\nI will not be applying with a SAT score.\n\nIn comparison with other applicants\u2019 ECs and stats, my application is lacking. I would appreciate it if someone could let me know if this is a problem. Or if I had solid essays, is it possible that this stuff may be enough?\n\nThanks.",

I\u2019ve taken the physics class my high school offered, but it wasn\u2019t a very advanced class. I have taken several physics classes at other colleges/universities.",

I have a YouTube channel, but I don\u2019t have a strong enough computer for good video editing, so I\u2019ve only got 2 videos on there.\n\nI\u2019d appreciate if you could let me know about what may go in a portfolio.

Do you do art? Do you play music? Write music? Have you done research?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm no admissions member but I'm 99% sure that those portfolios are the main things that prove that your activities aren't simply resume padding.",

If it goes well, I may have one in the spring. \n\nI mean I do have several notebooks filled with notes from MIT lectures. I don\u2019t know if that counts. Maybe I can use that to show that I understand the math and physics needed the research? Right now I\u2019m taking a 400 level mathematical physics course at my local university. I\u2019ve also sat in on several upper level electrodynamics courses, but I don\u2019t have formal proof of taking them though the professors could vouch for me. Could I put any of that in my portfolio?",

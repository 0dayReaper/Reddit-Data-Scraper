    "postText": "Hi everyone,\nSo I just had my interview for MIT yesterday and I thought I\u2019d make a post here with the questions I was asked as well as my answers (and some light explanations). You can also feel free to ask me anything, I was freaking out a lot before my interview so I know I would have liked something like this. Oh and if anyone is interested I can share my answers from my Google doc in more detail.\n\nAnyways, here are the main questions I was asked (from least personal to most)\nImportant side note: my EC asked for my resume beforehand to get an idea of who I am at school and outside of school so he had some info to go off of.\n\n* Why MIT? \n  - I was definitely expecting this one and as a result I came up I prepped the HELL out of it. My answer was about innovation and collaboration since I know that I really enjoy creating new things and working with others and MIT really stresses group work it seemed like my best answer. This one really does need to be catered to you though because it is about why you specifically are drawn to MIT out of all the great schools.\n\n* What major do you want to go to and why/ how did you get to that conclusion?\n  - So I wasn\u2019t asked this is this exact way, but the question was more or less why that major. My answer was about hardware engineering and I really love being hands on and working on parts of machinery to seek it all come together but at the same time I\u2019m fascinated with computers and enjoy coding. This question was also tied with the next one so my answers fit together.\n\n* Do you believe foreign policy is important in the world of engineering? \n  - I was asked this because my resume shows I have been president of Model UN at my school for a he last two years (and founded it) and I indicated I have a real interest in foreign relations and learning about worldly issues. My answer talked about how engineering is universal and we need collaboration from everyone to make progress and advance technology that works in all situations.\n\n* What is the best part of Model UN?\n  - This question came before the last one, but My answer was similar. I talked about how I really valued the ability to hear about international issues and learn from others who have different experiences from me. I also enjoy collaboration with people and getting their unique perspective. \n\n* Tell me about the academic program listed on your resume. \n  - Again, this wasn\u2019t the exact question but I can\u2019t give the exact question since it would give away my school lol. But basically he wanted more information about a very particular program offered at my school and what I did while participating. I just told about the entrance essay, AP class requirements, GPA requirements, college tours, quest speakers, and college/ academic workshops.\n\n* Tell me about your business.\n  - My resume talked about the Etsy shop I own where I sell holiday cards. He asked about how business was and if my shop was currently open and I explained that I\u2019m too busy currently but I really enjoy it when I can and I make good money.\n\nThe next part of the interview was for me to ask him questions, here is what I asked.\n\n* how was the weather adjusting from California (where I am) to New England? \n  - so I asked a more causal question to lighten the mood and really make things friendly and it worked well he was really excited to talk about all the seasons in the Boston area and how beautiful it is. \n\n* What was your favorite new thing transitioning from high school to college?\n\n* What was the class, community group, or club you felt had the most impact on who you are today?\n\nThis was all the stuff we talked about, feel free to ask me whatever about my academics or interview stuff!",

I then cited this https://www.engine.xyz/founders/axoft/ company that the engine sponsors because the wires really interest me especially since they\u2019re so reliant on computer engineering, which is my intended major. I also talked about how I\u2019ve heard so much about collaboration at MIT and how important it is from homework to lab research. That stood out to me because  working with others has always been a huge part of my learning experience since I\u2019ve been in marching band and model un. The last thing I mentioned was the maker space labs and how some are intended for students to teach students and some for teachers to teach students, I really like the diversity in learning there.

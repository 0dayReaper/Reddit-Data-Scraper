    "postText": "My daughter is applying to MIT EA. She got an interview request early Dec and it is now scheduled for Friday, day before the EA results are announced (based on EC's availability). Someone posted that EC's were requested to submit their feedback by Nov 21. Are interview requests random even before applications get some sort of reading? Nov 21 is just 3 weeks after application was due. Trying to understand the process and prepared for any outcome. :)\n\nGood luck to all the applicants and wish you the best!",

Second deadline for interviews ASSIGNED after Nov 14 is Dec 5. \n\nInterviewers get assigned applicants as soon as the applications are complete. For my personal example, I volunteered to get assigned 5 applicants in the early action cycle. I got my first one mid-October, and my last one on Nov 2nd. I had all my interviews done by Nov 6 as a result. \n\nIf your application didn\u2019t get assigned right away, it\u2019s probably because 1. you didn\u2019t get your application in early and 2. there weren\u2019t enough interviewers from your general area. This means you get moved to overflow. \n\nImagine if I am the only interviewer in my metro city area, but 6 people apply. Well, I only get assigned 5, because that\u2019s my limit. The leftover 1 might go to someone else in my state, if possible, or get assigned to overflow. Overflow means that anyone from anywhere in the world can choose to be assigned as your interviewer. \n\nIf I had to guess, the report will probably come in too late to be considered. However, students that I contacted before and could not interview in time did get in.",

            "comment": "That is strange. I have no insight to the process but to say that I think the interviews shouldn't happen unless all kids can be reached. \n\nI'm sure that'll be an unpopular opinion in here, but when MIT says 70% of applicants are actually qualified to attend the school, but they can only accept 5%, and they're admittedly judging based on who \"fits\" best into the school, those kids who don't get interviewed (or whose interviews come too late for consideration) are at a disadvantage. \n\nMaybe it's better to have the interviews than not. But still, it's definitely a disadvantage for the overlooked kids because they don't get the chance to show that extra info which plays a significant role in the \"holistic viewpoint\" MIT is seeking. \n\nAgain, maybe I'm looking for things to be too fair, since I'm a parent and I just want my kid to have a fair shot. MIT doesn't have to be fair. But it seems to me that they want to be perceived as fair, so if anyone at admissions sees this, take it as outside feedback. It's just one person's perspective. \nI hesitate to even post this, but whatever. I don't mean any harm, it's my honest, carefully considered thoughts. \n\nFor the record, my kid did not get an interview. He's hoping to get deferred and maybe get an interview before RD. He's already preparing everything he's done since applying EA to add to his profile. Some awards, college class grades, science competition entries, etc.\n\nHey, it's a fierce world. I realize MIT doesn't need to be completely perfect and fair.\n\nAlso, good luck to your daughter!",

And they were significantly better than the OP.\n\nThen one guy who was fantastic got admitted. Top math and CS student from a top 20 US private school. He and his hackathon partner got invited by a FAANG company to consider interning \u2026 then the company realized both boys were 16. His hackathon partner went on to start a multimillion dollar company straight out of high school and was named in the Forbes 30 Under 30. The MIT applicant had some other super-impressive achievements.\n\nI had two accepted this year but one withdrew (binding ED2 I believe). The girl accepted was also super-impressive. I can\u2019t say too much for a few months.",

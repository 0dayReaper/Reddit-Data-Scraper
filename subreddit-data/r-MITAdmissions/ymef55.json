My field of interest is biology and my only bio related EC is biomed research (since 11 grade) at my local university. Do most MIT students have all 4 extracurricular tied to their field of interest?",

Although I did learn enough after Unified to do what I had wanted to do in high school rocketry and space station design, but that\u2019s another story.\n\nMy extracurriculars were:\n1) music (I played in MITSO, and will run into a couple of MITSO alumni tomorrow at the Reading Symphony Orchestra!) \u2014 won city-wide concerto competition, provincial semi-finalist (French horn), top four in city; concert pianist. Played in like 5 different ensembles at various levels (pit orchestra, school concert band, school chamber orchestra, city-wide youth symphony, etc.)\n\n2) Physics Olympics, captain (we were the first place team out of around 45-50 at the local university\u2019s high school Physics Olympics but after I was admitted)\n\n3) President and founder of a club\n4) some random stuff (tutoring, baseball umpire and later head coach, and I was head coach when it didn\u2019t matter for college admissions \u2026 I did it because I wanted to! And to apply sabermetrics.)\n\nMy best friend in high school and I and maybe 3-5 of our other science-y friends entered a NASA Space Station design contest although I\u2019m sure we didn\u2019t do very well (we certainly didn\u2019t win). Did not put that down as we probably spent about 20-30 hours total on it, each of us.\n\nI tried other extracurriculars over my high school career and could say something about each, but didn\u2019t report those either.\n\nMy point is to illustrate how diverse my extracurriculars are and they had little to do with my major. However, I did have plenty of leadership, social skills, organizational skills, abilities and accomplishments.",

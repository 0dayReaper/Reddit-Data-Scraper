    "postText": "Frank Wang was rejected by MIT. He had pretty average grades and was not a genius by any means. But that didn't stop him from working on his childhood dream. He skipped college classes and instead was improving his drone technology through the night, he even stayed up to 5 am.\n\nSoon later he founded a drone company DJI and later accumulated a net worth of 5 Billion USD.\n\nSo what should you take from this? No matter your education/ privileges if you have the dedication you will go places.",

Considering MIT is a heavily tech-focused school, would it be better to talk about something else, or does talking about this show I am well-rounded?",

I\u2019m sure every single somewhat qualified applicant could frame it all around those macro-areas, but you want to stand out. I assure you that not many would be able to write about studying religious texts. \nGreat job and best of luck!",

    "postText": "Hello, I am an international rising sophomore and I study in an IB school in Europe. I am highly interested in math and CS so I took AP Calculus BC and self studied it in freshman year and got a 5. I plan to take some uni math classes like calc 3 and Linear Algebra this year and also self study and take AP Physics C mechanics and E&amp;M. I have been programming for 4 years and done some CS and data sciences courses on my own. I was wondering if anyone could suggest more ECs and other things that could help me get into MIT or a similar college. Thanks",

Focusing on those aspects will allow you to write great essays, which is what actually gets you into great schools, assuming you\u2019re grade-competitive. \n\nBasically, don\u2019t do robotics just because of you think you should. I didn\u2019t do any tech ECs and got in while expressing interest in aerospace engineering.",

I currently tutor junior high school students in mathematics and this has exposed me to a lot of struggles students from Lower income families experience just to get an education. I simply offered to tutor them since I was out of school. Graduated 2019,got delayed by covid for more than a year. I am now actively pursuing studies abroad the US mainly because I would love to pursue a career in both mathematics and medicine and this isn't possible in my home country and also because I would love to learn from the best and get quality education in order to achieve my dreams of coming back to helping these students in both mathematics and in the well being also of the health of women and children most especially in Africa not just Nigeria. \nI am a very competitive student also. I would love to however ask if I can apply to MIT or would stand a chance in here. Thanks",

I don\u2019t know how often that effects their decision, but it might. \n\nFor domestic students the admission board doesn\u2019t know how much their family makes when deciding (this is called need-blind)\n\nEdit: most top schools (ivy league, MIT, Stanford, Caltech, etc) have this same policy. Need blind for domestic, but not for international. All students receive financial aid based upon demonstrated need, but what that actually means depends upon the school (Cornell offered me less than MIT).",

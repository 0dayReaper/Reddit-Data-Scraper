    "postText": "I'm an incoming first year engineering student at the University of Toronto, thereby first year classes start for me in a few days, and I would like apply for a transfer application to MIT but I'm a bit confused with the process.\n\nA few questions I have:\n\n\\- Can I apply right now, or do I have to wait till I complete first year?\n\n\\- Do I have to write the SAT?\n\n\\- How long does processing take for a transfer application?\n\n\\- What is the average scholarships given to students? - I understand that the value of scholarships differs per student and program, but as a Canadian student the system seems quite different to me and I don't have much of an idea of how much I'll have to pay if I get admitted.\n\nHelp would be greatly appreciated, thanks everyone!",

Usually there are only something like 2-3 INTERNATIONAL transfers per year. I've been talking with some from other countries who have found me on other media (e.g., Indonesia, two East Indians). I don't know if it's confirmation bias or not, but yeah, it's brutal.\n\nI've talked with some of the interviewers in the Vancouver area and they think the overall Freshman admit rate for Canadians is 1%, and there are some very impressive applicants. Given that transfer admissions is even more competitive than freshman admissions... you can do the math.\n\nYou might ask why there are so few Canadian admits and also why there aren't any Canadian transfers ... some of us interviewers have speculated that you have very good options in Canada (U of T is either the best or second best in Canada, with plenty of connections, plenty of extracurriculars and class options, and even UBC, McGill, Waterloo, McMaster, Queens, Guelph, Carleton, U of Alberta, etc. are great universities).",

    "postText": "Hey! I'm an Indian student. I applied to MIT last year, but was deferred, then rejected. I got into UCLA, though. I wrote the JEE Advanced exam (formerly IIT-JEE) recently and got an all India rank of 4, enough to get a seat in IIT Bombay. I was thinking of going to UCLA and attempting to transfer to MIT, but one of my friends in MIT told me that her friend told her that transferring to MIT from IIT Bombay is easier than transferring from UCLA. I've asked other people, but they feel that the opposite is true. What do you think would be better?",

            "comment": "Hi man! I don't know which would be easier. But I want to say that you can consider applying to University of Cambridge/Oxford. Their requirements are a rank under 2K in JEE Advanced and 90+ in boards(CBSE/ISC) or 95+(State board). University of Cambridge is equally good as MIT if not just a bit behind MIT. After this you will called up for an interview in Mumbai which is doable. With your credentials you will easily get the letter of acceptance. This will really be easy for you rather doing this transferring buisness. UCLA is 10000 times better than IITB so don't go for IITB coz transfer rate is below 1 percent. So you can't be sure there are even less chances of you getting into MIT as a transfer student from IITB than your chance were of getting AIR 1. Hope this help thank you!",

Congratulations on getting in!   \n If you spend your time there, or at an IIT for that matter, thinking of how to get out, you're wasting a wonderful opportunity.  Go where they want you, and good luck!",

    "postText": "I am a junior in high school and nearing the deadline for senior year class submissions, I just finished 5 AP classes this year and have 3 as of now for next year. I was just wondering what would be more beneficial to add, either a fourth AP(likely chem or bio) or dual enrollment at a community college where i would likely take calc 2 and either a computer science or another math class. I\u2019m planning on majoring in computer science and there are no more computer science or math courses left at my HS.",

            "comment": "I\u2019d consider your backup options since you are most likely not getting into MIT (pure statistics, nothing against you personally) - would your backup schools let you transfer your community college classes? Do they require Chem for your degree? If so, does AP Chem let you get out of it? MIT doesn\u2019t take AP Chem to skip a class, but in my case, I was able to transfer all of Calc 2-4 from my community college (which was the cheapest in my state btw, nothing fancy here). YMMV.\n\nIf your backup school(s) take(s) the credit for both AP Chem and Calc 2, decide which class you\u2019d rather take in a small setting of &lt;30 students versus a lecture hall with 150+ in it. Which subject do you think you will struggle with more? Whichever that is, might make sense to take that now.\n\nYour admission to MIT will not come down to AP Chem vs Calc 2. Both are rigorous classes.",

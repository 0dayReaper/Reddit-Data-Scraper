            "comment": "Admissions have always been quite opaque, which I find very confusing because it doesn't allow students to know what they need to invest in to maximize their chances to succeed.  I personally find the transparent admissions process in other countries like China and Japan to be effective in motivating students to study harder in subjects that will prove beneficial in later life like mathematics, language, and science.  Thanks to the discovery process in the Harvard lawsuit in 2018, we see that a logistic model helps breakdown the change in likelihood of getting admitted.\n\nFirst, we notice that sports plays an extremely large role.  This is probably smaller for MIT, but I think most US universities gives an outsized role to sports.  Second, just having good academics is just the basic requirement.  Having high grades doesn't materially improve your chances, but not having high grades disqualifies you.  Third, the schools want something in you that stands out from the other students, it could be an esoteric musical instrument, an exclusive sport like polo/crew, or some ground breaking research you did in high school.  \n\nAt the end of the day, it comes down to how the admissions board likes you or not.  Don't take it too personally, I think the admissions board has no idea what they are doing.  Just a few years ago they fired the dean of admissions because they realized she conned her way into the admissions office with a fake diploma and such.  She was famous for saying she didn't want MIT to be filled with \"textureless Asian math grinds\".  I think America really needs a government organization to administer higher education, and there should be much more transparency.  Something like a comprehensive exam with a stated syllabus would be much better for improving overall education prior to university level by encouraging direct investment into additional learning.\n\ntldr:  Take water polo or horse back riding to maximize your chances of getting admitted into a US university.  Act posh and fancy.  Sailing is great too.  And give a nice donation to the athletic department of sailing, your money goes much farther with the athletic departments than it does with the admissions office.",

MIT might be the healthiest horse in the glue factory, but that isn't saying much considering how non-objective US college admissions are.",

If the admissions department was great at picking people who would succeed, you would think there would be declining suicide numbers at MIT.  Sadly, admissions officers trying to decide who to get into the most challenging engineering school in the country seem to be doing poorly in terms of the base suicide metric.  I believe in my 3rd or 4th year the suicides got so bad they had to hire psychologists and counselors for each dorm.  Given how they claim they have too many qualified students to choose from, one would think it would be easy enough to just rank the students by terms of likelihood to succeed academically and then just let them in.",

A test will add some randomization factor on top of the correlation to success that the test will bring, so if there are that many qualified students the variance of the students at the top will provide the lottery-like randomization that will be fairly applied to everyone to determine who gets access to the slots.",

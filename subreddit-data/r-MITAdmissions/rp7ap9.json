    "postText": "I'd like advice about what to do in a seriously unusual situation.  My daughter had an interview for MIT (regular decision), and the alumni interviewer was very negative about MIT.  He told her that \"the atmosphere at MIT is super unhealthy and toxic\", and \"nobody has friends there because you can't put friends on a resume\", among other similar things.  He said the profs don't teach anything you need to know to do the problem sets and expect you to teach it to yourself then move on to something different the next day.  During the interview, his housemate came into his Zoom background and started repeatedly running the coffee grinder, drowning out what my daughter was answering.  He asked her to repeat her answer, and the housemate ground coffee again, drowning out her repeated answer, to which he said, \"oh well, I didn't hear that, but never mind\" and moved on.  He did not converse with her or respond to her answers.  When she asked him about extracurricular activities at MIT, he said that people only do them for their resumes, and nothing about them is enjoyable.  When she asked him what was his best experience from attending MIT, he recited an equation which he thought was cool.  Needless to say, my daughter no longer wants to go to MIT.  It was a top place she was very interested in until this interview.  I'm not sure what to do.  I think MIT might want to know about an alumni interviewer who was overtly sabotaging them.  I also doubt that this alumni interviewer would be capable of writing up a favorable report in support of her application, since he seemed to be discouraging her from attending MIT before the interview even started.  While I couldn't hear the interview through her closed door, I could tell that he was talking quite a lot of the time.  My daughter is very expert at interviewing, so it definitely wouldn't have been the case that he had to fill in the conversation.  Should she contact the MIT admissions office and report this and see if they'd like to give her a new interview, or would that automatically make her look bad? Any thoughts?",

The only thing with a hint of truth to it is that MIT can sometimes make you feel like you have to always be doing something because everyone else is, which I think is unhealthy. \n\nIf you or your daughter has any questions about MIT, feel free to DM me (I'm a current junior)",

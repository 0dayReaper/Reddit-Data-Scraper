    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am a 14 year old ambitious teenager hoping to join MIT for undergrad as an international student.\n\nI am currently in Yr9 IGCSE board in Qatar, originally from India. I will be finishing my schooling at age 19 with A-levels.\n\nI am willing to put the effort in and am more than happy to hear advice on what I can commence doing from now which can increase my chances of getting into MIT. I am an A, A+ student and generally good in academics.  (Hoping on doing Mechanical Engineering or Computer Science).\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA few more questions if I may...\n\nI am in Set-1 Maths (an official group of top 20 students in my year group in Maths), thus I have been selected to give my GCSE Math exams in Yr10, which is generally done by students at the end of Yr11. I will be obtaining extra qualifications such as GCSE Further Maths, A-levels Further Maths adding to the normal Math ones which one leaves school with. Will this play any effective role in my application?\n\nAlso as I have previously read an answer on Quora, in which the lady stated that selective universities like MIT take little to no international students for undergrad, and there would only be 3-5 vacancies for my nationality. Is any of this actually even true?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time!",

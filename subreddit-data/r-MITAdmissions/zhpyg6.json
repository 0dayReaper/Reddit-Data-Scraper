I want to know about why MIT thought you were a good fit, and what you've done to achieve that.",

My son applied early action to MIT, and while I know he's a unique, brilliant kid, I'm extremely anxious to see if that translated to his application, essays, supplement, etc.\nIt'll be very disappointing to him if he doesn't get in, since he's been talking about it since we visited Boston when he was just a little toddler, but I know it should be viewed more like a lottery than a validation of who he is. So many great kids, limited number of spots. \nI didn't realize the college process would be this stressful. And I'm just the dad lol.",

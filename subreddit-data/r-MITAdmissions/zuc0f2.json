Only took the AP classes that interested me (e.g., AP bio, chem, etc., AP US History/Supreme Court was fun). Back then, didn't have AP Comp Sci or whatever \"specialized\" classes. Probably had 1-2 AP classes per term.\n\nObv, MIT admissions is different now.",

Things are different. Also, back then we had an MIT head of admissions that was very much into not focusing solely in academics and taking a look at students as a whole. Unfortunately she had to step down after MIT realized she had lied about her resume. It was a big scandal back in the day, but her performance at the job was fantastic. I worry since then MIT has changed some of its acceptance practices for the worse. I interview kids who want to get in each year. Makes me sad to see so many bright and talented kids not get in.",

I understand that MIT is looking for work ethic and a hunger for challenge, and my deliberate decision to move down from AP to regular probably does not give off a good look. While I dream for a spot, kids who work their butts off in 8 AP schedule definitely deserve it a lot more than I do. Thanks again for taking the time to give your perspective.",

If someone is taking a lot of AP classes and getting 5s in their exams, and have a perfect or near enough SAT score, they won't get into MIT. You need something that sets you apart from the other 50% of the students with the same things.",

            "comment": "Here's my opinion (although I hope it's somewhat educated). Alumnus and Educational Counselor.\n\n**MIT expects applicants to have challenged themselves**, and there are many ways to challenge yourself (AP, IB, A-level, dual enrollment, go to a college preparatory school, TJHSST, etc.) --\n\nAt least two reasons for this:\n\n(1) I've looked at some of the better public schools in my area and for instance, Milton High School (Milton, MA) will require something like seven \"full load\" classes. Full load classes really vary -- could be something like AP Calculus BC or could be something like AP Physics 1 (I think they've offered 2 every 2-3 years due to interest) or it could be less challenging.\n\n7x full-load classes at the AP Calculus BC + AP Physics C (not 1, not 2) level (AP US History, etc.) would be less demanding than 48 MIT units. That would be closer to \\~35-42 hours per week for all class work including classes and homework.\n\nSo if you don't challenge yourself, it's MUCH harder to get to MIT level.\n\n(2) Challenging yourself aligns with MIT's values.\n\nLike ... we love challenges. We would do things outside of what's assigned because we're interested or fascinated or we want to really master the material.\n\nOne other thought: as I've told some people, if you get stressed out taking AP Calculus AB or BC or you're struggling in these, well, 18.01 = more than 2x speed compared to AP Calculus BC and more than 4x AP Calculus AB. So \"if stress is not your thing, don't go to MIT.\"\n\nOn the flip side, **an education from MIT is MUCH more than just about taking classes.**\n\nIf you have to take 8+ classes and have no time for other stuff or balance or even \"life\", then something is off.\n\nBy the time I was deep into my graduate work (and this is not a secret):\n\nYou can email the professor nicely and obtain a syllabus and buy the books and read them yourself even before the term starts. So anyone can do this at home.\n\nThe classroom gives you exposure to (hopefully) 1) an educated teacher who is a guide, instructor, coach, etc., 2) peers -- both of which help you learn and retain better. I had an older brother figure at MIT (I only have a younger brother so I appreciate any older friends who have taught me) -- freshman year, he mentioned that for any given person, they learn only a fraction of what they're taught or what they experience. To increase this a lot, you need good teachers and peers. 3) Lab work ... you can't replicate this at home.\n\nChanging gears to extracurriculars now:\n\nIt's important to have positive outlets to your stress. Benders aren't cool.\n\nThere are LOTS of ways to enrich yourself without having to take a ton of classes. If you did debate and speech, you probably learned a lot about a very valuable set of skills. If you organized a club, you probably learned some other interesting set of skills. Even if you were not French and had no French heritage but you joined French club, maybe you'll learn a lot of stuff. (Like me, I have 0% European heritage and I had maybe 1.5-2 hours review on my plane trip over to France, and was fluent with the natives during my honeymoon.)\n\nMIT is a private university: even MIT Admissions has noted there are more than 450 clubs and organizations. That's about 1 for every 10 undergrads. So it's a valid point to wonder how applicants will contribute towards the MIT community.",

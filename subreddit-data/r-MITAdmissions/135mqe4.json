Even if one prompt changes, you still have the others mostly done.\n\nI think the \u201cwhat do you do for fun\u201d essay, the \u201cworld\u201d essay, and \u201cchallenge\u201d essay have stayed consistent the past 5 years or so. The \u201ccommunity\u201d essay did change slightly this year - it emphasizes how you work with people from different backgrounds. There\u2019s a smaller 100 word why MIT essay too that has stayed the same.\n\nAlso, I think the word count decreased from 250 to 225 this year.",

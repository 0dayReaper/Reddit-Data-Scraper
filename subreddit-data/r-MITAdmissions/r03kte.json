But in school he has been having a tough time in LA and other classes like history which compose of creative writing. As an outcome, his gpa is a 3.91. Does he serve a good chance at MIT still?",

Lacking in creative writing also probably means your essays aren\u2019t the best either. I wish your friend the best of luck though!",

Even if they are international, if they were somehow able to compete in all such US contests at such a high level they would be nearly guaranteed at MIT, not matter their grades. \n\nThat said, I'm pretty sure such a profile doesn't exist, as I don't believe anyone has both qualified for IMO and USACO camp in the past few years :clown:. Just unrealistic hopeful aspirations by the OP.",

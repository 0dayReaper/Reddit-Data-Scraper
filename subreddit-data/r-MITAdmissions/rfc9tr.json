    "postText": "I took the SAT in Dec 2019. Got a 1400 (780 Math, 620 Eng). I know the score is very low as per MIT standards but the Math score is pretty good according to me. And since MIT mainly looks at that, I was wondering if I should include that or go test-optional?",

I decided to not include that on my MIT applications because I think they'll just glance at the 1480 and get negative impression, but maybe miss the fact that I got 800 in 8th grade",

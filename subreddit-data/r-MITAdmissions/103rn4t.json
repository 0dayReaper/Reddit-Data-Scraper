    "postText": "&gt;!Hi All,!&lt;\n\nI am currently applying for the MBAN at MIT Sloan. The deadline is today at 3:30pm EST, yet the portal closed earlier than this deadline at around 12:00 am EST.\n\nWas making final touches to my application before hitting the submit button. I have emailed the admissions team pointing out that the portal closed before the deadline. Do you think i have a chance of them re-opening it.\n\nI am so stressed out and shaking right now.",

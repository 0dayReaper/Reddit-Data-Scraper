    "postText": "I currently have a 34 ACT with a math subscore of 32. I have heard that the math subscore is also very important to get over a 33 on. I understand that with the pandemic there will be a lot less weight held on testing, but I\u2019m curious if that 32 would be enough?\n\nWould any other year that 32 subscore hurt me even with my overall 34? Is it worth sending in a subpar act even if test scores are optional? (I know my score isn\u2019t subpar but in terms of MIT with math that may be the case).",

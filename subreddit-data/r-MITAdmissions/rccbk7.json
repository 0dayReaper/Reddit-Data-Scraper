    "postText": "I tried signing up for 3 SATs, but they repeadedly got cancelled in my area, due to COVID-19 concerns. I am worried that the school may use AP Exam scores to replace the missing SAT Scores, as my AP Exam scores aren't as high as they can be (I got a 4 on Calc AB, AP Lang, AP US, WHAP). Hopefully, everything else can make up for this.\n\n(My gpa is near perfect with 10+ AP and honors courses, I am an Eagle Scout, and I've won regional, state, and international championships in piano competitions, I worked as a piano tutor for 5 years, and am president of my school's CS club, where we teach basic java and c++ to members, as well as do hackathons. Just some side info).\n\nI am applying for EA. Would I still have a chance of admission?",

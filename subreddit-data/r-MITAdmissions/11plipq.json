When people use the word, hooks are legacy status (irrelevant for MIT but considered at some other colleges), recruited athlete, low-income, rural school district, and underrepresented minority. Something like winning an award, while helpful, is not a hook.",

The guy said that if I requested one through the application and gave a reason (simply I want one), they\u2019d just give it to me. \n\nI think it might just be an auto-waiver thing. Or like they barely review it to see if you should get one. Give a legit reason who you want a fee waiver and the app will cost nothing. \n\nSo if it won\u2019t cost you anything, it\u2019s worth a shot",

    "postText": "Art and music have always been my passion and most of my extracurricular activities are related to them. I\u2019ve recently discovered various projects from MIT that combined art and science, and decided to apply for MIT as I always interested in both fields. Although I\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours outside of school to dedicate my time on bassoon, oil painting, graphic design, and generative art and received some art-related awards, I have almost no academic extracurriculars that show my interest/proficiency in STEM fields. I am pretty confident that my calculus teacher wrote me a good letter of recommendation but that\u2019s about it. Would I still have a chance of getting accepted into MIT?",

My closest friend is very artsy, did an STS minor and was part of art publications with no strong \"academic\" extracurriculars in high school.\n\nJust remember there's only about 1000 per year at MIT but 1000s of HS students who graduate with \"academic extracurriculars\" and most of them apply to MIT.\n\nIt's not hard to find someone in the admissions pool who was on the math team, but it is hard to find someone who is creative and passionate and pursued art! So lean into that, it's great!",

            "comment": "One of MIT's primary ways of weeding out who fits and who doesn't is by looking at who *doesn't* have any non-academic extracurriculars (or any extracurriculars in general). The admissions people at MIT look for people who are more well-rounded than a pure academic. If your academics are in order, you have a better chance than a valedictorian with no extracurriculars. Go for it!",

While many students take a recap, you're expected to have been introduced to it already. How are your calculus grades? If you're not taking it now, are you next year? Is your SAT math 750-800? \n\nIt's a problem when it's a trend, and when you have no excuse. A B isn't ideal, but a B in precalc doesn't matter much if you've got an A in your calculus coursework. \n\nYou have to set yourself apart outside the classroom. What can you spend your free time on that'll make a difference? You're a CS major, why? Why do you love it, what can't you wait to do with it, and why can't you do that now? It's okay if your \"thing\" isn't related to CS.\n\nIf you find something you're really passionate about, and you really do something with it, it will help your college applications. (Much) more importantly, though, it will help you. That's the kindof life you should be living. It should be about something you care about, not college apps.",

If you have good test scores and explain what happened in PreCalc and continued to challenge yourself w AB/BC I think you are fine. But I really don\u2019t know. \n\nAlso, some high schools inflate grades so much everyone has a 4.0. (Unweighted). It becomes meaningless and so I think they look at the school profile? If the two B+ mean you are at the bottom of your class, that\u2019s different. But I doubt that. Go for it! \n\nThey like heart, I think people who are doing good (even in ordinary ways) means more to them than doing well in competitions. It\u2019s all in the blogs.",

    "postText": "I don't think my odds of getting in are very good, so I had the idea of passing my essays through a cipher I made, because I heard they like \"quirky\" applications. I made the cipher (and its pretty good if I do say so myself) but now the question is whether or not I use it. Do y'all think it would help my chances or hurt them?",

If you truly have a fun and exciting essay, then it'll be good, but if you wrote some mid-tier paragraphs, then coding a cipher doesn't make it better.",

    "postText": "Hey!\n\nI am much younger than all of you and I really appreciate this subreddit.\n\nI am a high-school student based in Turkey, there is a ranking test in our poorly built education system. Which decides the high schools that you may go based on what percentage you are, in all of the 8th graders(last grade in middle school) that year. (You only can take this test once and once only.) \n\nSo anyways my goal was 0.1 percentage but I got much lower because I screwed things up in mathematics. Therefore I missed pretty mutch all of the high-schools that may lead to MIT way more easier, because they have AP programs. But MIT is my dream school. \n\nWith all that considered my application seems a long shot to me because again in our poorly built education system the tests that you must take to go to a university happens once a year! And studying for SAT and ACT than failing them, losing my chances aboard, may fail my college life in homeland because of the tests I must take. (They are hard..)\n\n**Here is my question;**\n\nCan I apply for MIT using my TYT and AYT tests (they are like SAT and ACT tests in Turkey)? \n\nOr can I win a university in Turkey, than study for SAT and ACT to apply? (apply as a freshmen) \n\nI still think my situation is a long shot, but as I said it's my dream.\n\nI just wanted to ask you these so I don't disappoint myself again.\n\nThanks for all of the reading, muchs of love..",

But, however, there are way more international students for graduate than undergraduate, so you might have better chances.\n\n&gt;No. Your options are SAT or ACT\n\nTrue, they are required. They measure how prepared you are for college, and MIT relies on them to be a good predictor. \n\nBut I know that SAT Math might be easier for internationals, while SAT English is a struggle. So you must master English. They don't just want excellent students, they want excellent students who are proficient in English.\n\nAnd it might not require that much preparation if you are a really **good** student. Turkey has plenty of test centers for these exams, with many exam dates/year. I think it's worth to try, but just don't get disappointed if thing turn out different. And definitely study for the tests in your country.",

Since there is plenty of time until 11th grade, i will try to master my English.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;And it might not require that much preparation if you are a really good student.

A competitive school might look good, but they take more into consideration how you took advantage of the opportunities you already have. \n\nIf you challenge yourself, study hard and benefit your community for all the four years while in high school, you might get the same chances of admission as other students.",

I saw some people already get their interview mails, but I haven\u2019t gotten any yet.\n\nWhen, if possible, do interview mails typically role out? Or is there any disadvantage for internationals/me that I don\u2019t know of?",

He only did a one month post-doc at MIT (on the 80s), and he is also a friend of my family, so I think it wouldn't be very ethical for me to be interviewed by him.",

But for some reason, slideroom was lagging, and it did not take me to the payment option. I got access to the payment option just a couple of minutes after the deadline. I immediately submitted my portfolio. Am I screwed?\n\nIs there anyone here who submitted their portfolio today? Did anyone face a similar situation?  \n(I know I shouldn't have waited till the day of the deadline, but I had other issues)",

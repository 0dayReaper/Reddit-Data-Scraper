    "postText": "I\u2019m international from not really popular country and pretty much sure that there are no alumni in my area. It is told that in this case interview will be waived, but I\u2019m not sure about it. In many top universities they interview strongest students first, even from interviewer-unavailable areas using online platforms. Does this work same in MIT? Or should I expect rejection already?",

            "comment": "I volunteered as an MIT alumni interviewer for ten years, and the role seemed to serve then was to provide an additional recommendation letter for your application; specifically one from someone who had experienced the culture at MIT. It was not like a job interview particularly or a test one had to pass. It was more an opportunity for an alumn(a/us) to learn more about you and what is unique about you and how you might succeed at MIT and to write about those things for the admissions staff to read along side your other letters of recommendation.",

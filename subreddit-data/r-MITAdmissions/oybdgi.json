    "postText": "hi there!\n\nim considering applying to MIT for a physics bachelors degree either this september or next one. im going to be trying to directly contact the admissions people at MIT soon, but im ... very intimidated just because of how... cool it is lol so i thought it couldnt hurt to ask the internet first. \n\nso, i live in canada, im over 18, i didnt graduate high school, and i wont be returning to high school or getting my GED or anything like that. the vast majority of schools up here let you apply to whatever program you want as a 'mature student' (colleges - anyone over 19 usually; universities usually over 21. except for at least mcgill for some reason.), and then if you dont have your high school, or youve been out of school for a very long time, or just dont have any proof of 'academic viability', they let you - usually - take equivalency tests for whatever subjects most relevant to your program. generally, from all that i know, mature students have an easier time getting accepted to universities and colleges than people coming straight from high school. like i said, im going to be getting in direct contact with the admissions people at MIT - as well as like twelve other institutions across canada and the us - to figure out more exact information and requirements etc, but maybe someone here could tell me, - do you think it would be a waste of time for me to apply to MIT? im really passionate about learning. im also indigenous (native american), and transgender, which i know sometimes means something.\n\nthank you for any advice you might have. i hope youre doing well and staying safe\\~",

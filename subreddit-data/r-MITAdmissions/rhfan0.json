    "postText": "So I applied EA and submitted a research portfolio. Idk how, but I missed the words \u201clayperson\u2019s terms\u201d at the top of the portfolio. \n\nHow badly do you think me using a lotta scientific words has gone? I did kind of explain things very briefly, but I\u2019m not sure if it was simplifying things enough.\n\nI mean, I guess I\u2019ll kinda find out what happened on Saturday haha, but plz soothe/stress this anxious gal\n\nI hope this helps y\u2019all RDers haha",

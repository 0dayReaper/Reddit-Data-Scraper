He did say his name though, and she searched him up and it was a legitimate alumni. She agreed to a zoom call with him and it was a relatively short call where they discussed MIT and he talked about his experience and application process a bit. It was quite casual overall! My friend did tell her counselor about it beforehand and he said it was unusual that it was a text invitation.",

Apparently, MIT are allowing alumni\u2019s to reach out by text as so many students are missing their emails. (Students like me lol)",

    "postText": " \n\nHello, I am a current freshman at the University of New Hampshire. I was wondering if anyone knew what my chance would be of getting accepted to MIT as a transfer student for my sophomore year.\n\nA few things about myself:\n\nI am a neuroscience major with a mechanical engineering minor. Across my first two semesters, I have earned and maintained a 4.0 GPA (nearly 100 in almost 10 classes including chem 1 + 2, bio 1 + 2, psychology, and calc as well as their labs.) As a result of my GPA (which ended up being in the top 10% of the school) I was asked to join the honors college and immediately accepted that request.\n\nAs for extracurriculars, I have taken part in two clubs (before they were canceled this year due to covid) being chess club and rock climbing. I was looking into starting a rocketry club at the college, however, due to covid, I cannot currently do that. And outside of school, I frequently go hiking and rock climbing with friends.\n\nAnother notable thing about me is my work in the research field so far. I am looking into pre-med, and so i have already started to do some personal work. I have two papers fully written (abstract to appendices) that I am hoping to publish sometime soon (they are on Nematode Chemotaxis and Tetrahymena eating habits). Also I am working to help create a 3D printable prosthetic hand for women in the military as that was something that a read about at my university and I thought it would be a good challenge.\n\nI know for some transfers, the colleges will look at high school. I had a 3.6 GPA (that got better each year) during high school and a few accomplishments of my senior year include winning the school science fair for a prosthetic hand where I wrote code for, and 3D printed a very basic prosthetic hand. I also went to the state championship for the VEX robotic competitions.\n\nI took my SATs over 3 years ago (I earned a 1390/1600), and so they are no longer considered valid; however, due to covid, I have not been able to find a spot to take them as they get canceled as soon as I sign up for one. Luckily for me, MIT currently says that SAT will not be required for admissions due to covid for this year. Would not sending a score in have any effect even though the MIT website say it will not?\n\nLastly, I understand the MIT usually has an admissions rate for transfer of about 4% so I know that the chances are slim. I will be applying for the spring semester (my second semester of sophomore year.) My reasoning for this is that, on average, there are about \"35 - 50 students that apply for the spring term, 0 - 5 of which are admitted\" \\~mitadmissions.org.\n\nLike I stated earlier, I understand that the chance of admission is very slim but I wanted to hear what other people thought about my chances. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and anything helps!",

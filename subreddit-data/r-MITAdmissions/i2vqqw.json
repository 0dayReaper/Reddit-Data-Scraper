From https://mitadmissions.org/apply/firstyear/tests-scores/\n&gt; We do not have cut off or recommended scores for the ACT or SAT as scores are evaluated within an applicant\u2019s context. To view test score statistics from the most recent admissions year, visit [our admissions statistics page](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/stats/).\n\nI would also take the admissions statistics with a big grain of salt because there's obvious self selection in applications; e.g. a lot of folks with 1400 or other scores and that are otherwise well-qualified may be too scared to apply.\n\nBit of an old post on the blogs, but a goodie:\nhttps://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/whats_the_big_deal_about_402/",

One more thing though, do you think that taking the SAT would give me any (minimal) advantage over an applicant who hasn't, and would the SAT replace the TOEFL as im probably more comfortable taking the SAT (yes, I know that's weird)",

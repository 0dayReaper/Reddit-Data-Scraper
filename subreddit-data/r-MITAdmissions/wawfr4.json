    "postText": "Hey guys. I'm about to start my senior year in high school and I'm getting pretty close to applying to colleges. I'm sure my GPA, test scores, and extracurriculars are are good, but my one concern is my coursework. In eighth grade, I was not necessarily the best student, so I was not recommended for honors classes. I was quickly upgraded to honors classes after my first semester of high school though. I've taken just about every AP class at my high school, except for AP Bio and AP Stats (but I never took any AP tests. Is that a big deal? \ud83d\ude2c). I am concerned that my coursework will hold me back. Is this a valid concern?",

It's not the most rigorous, but since you said that your school offers 10ish AP classes then it should be fine. If your GPA, SAT/ACT, and ECs are good, then you should be fine. I, for example, will have finished 11 APs (13 APs if you count Physics C M and Physics C E&amp;M as two different courses and AP Macro and AP Gov as separate) but that's only because my school offers 24 AP classes lol.",

    "postText": "How much will completing a Micromasters course on EDx increase my admission chances?  \nI'm taking Data Science and Statistics. I'm also currently looking for jobs with data analysis and probably will be working in the field within a month (I have good contacts and recommendations). Fresh off high school, already 6 months of experience in the field + 3 years teaching college-level math + 6 months Podcast Administrator/host (One of the biggest in our region).   \n\n\nWorking on some articles, and also planning on joining Kaggle competitions with a team I am training myself. I am an international student (Brazil), brown, lower-class, and disabled if that makes any difference.",

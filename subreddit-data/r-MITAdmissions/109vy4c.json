    "postText": "So basically, I wanted to apply but I was so intimidated by it, so I had second thoughts however finally, I decided to apply. I applied well before January 5th deadline. What happened after that was that I was again so intimidated (freaking MIT) that I withdrew my application. \n\nThen I came to know about extended deadline, and I submitted my application before January 9th deadline (with a different email ofc). I did it and basically submitted it and got an automated email and everything. \n\nI just want to know; did I ruin everything for me? I know that students are supposed to be decisive about everything, but it was just my fear getting better of me. Will AOs think of this as strange??",

Why would you do that? You can be intimidated while the application is being processed.  Are you saying you could not bear the thought of being rejected? \n\nAnd did you pay again upon resubmission. Did your counselor and teachers have to resubmit everything? \n\nLife will be full of rejections.  To win, you\u2019ll have to throw your hat into whatever it is you really want and accept the failures graciously and rejoice in your successes.  Your failures will make you grow and learn; they are an important part of life. \n\nGood luck to you",

I know this is ineptitude on my part, but I thought that I was not worthy of applying. \n\n\\--And did you pay again upon resubmission. Did your counselor and teachers have to resubmit everything?\n\nI had got fee waivers and my teachers and counsellors submitted everything again. I'm immensely grateful to them. I deserved censure after this fiasco, but my teacher was so patient with me. \n\nI am so ashamed of my irrational behavior.",

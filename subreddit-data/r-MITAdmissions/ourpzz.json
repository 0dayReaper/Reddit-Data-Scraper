    "postText": "I know that MIT doesn\u2019t require sat scores anymore, and I haven\u2019t been able to take the test since the only testing locations that have spots are in the next state over. I have a decent academic resume otherwise:\nI have been taking 3- 400 level physics courses at my local university, I have decent ap scores for most subjects (at least the ones I studied for), my gpa is around 4.4, I have numerous volunteer hours, I have attended all state band, and I will probably be getting a paid internship at one of the largest semiconductor companies this fall - I heard paid internships bode better for admissions so I added that detail.\n\nNow, in light of all this, I was wondering if it is even worth taking the sat? Would I be viewed differently? To me, the matter is mostly one of expediency; I\u2019m too lazy to go drive a few hours away to take a boring test. But if it will significantly impact my chances of getting in, then I\u2019ll reconsider. \n\nAny assistance would be appreciated.",

Ive participated in tennis, track and field, and cross country. I do powerlifting as a hobby when sports are out; otherwise my main hobbies are reading and playing the piano. I\u2019ve been teaching myself to code in Python in my spare time too; it\u2019s cool to see a computer do hundreds of thousands of calculations in a few seconds =). I\u2019ve worked a job too for a few months earlier this year, and my current job title is lab assistant in the physics department at my local university in case any of that is relevant. I anticipate I\u2019ll  good letters is recommendation when it comes time for that. I know that my resume may not be enough for MIT, but I was just wondering if it\u2019s even harder to get in without SAT scores.",

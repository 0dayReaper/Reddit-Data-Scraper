Moreover, I have developed a few apps which were downloaded more than 1.5 million times all over the world. I feel like I have no chances of being admitted to any university and I completely lost my motivation for giving the best of myself every day\ud83d\ude25",

            "comment": "Yeah, it's pretty tough for international students. I'm an international student too from a prestigious high school, a 1550 on the SAT ,a 43/45 Predicted grade for the IB, good ECs and I was also rejected.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think its damn cutthroat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, don't lose hope and motivation. I looked at this rejection with a certain perspective which I think may help everyone rejected:\n\n* You gave your 100%. Be proud of your effort and growth\n* You're achievements aren't going away with this rejection. You're still the person you were a week back! Be proud and look forward to the future\n* It's MIT's loss that they couldn't admit you. If you're feeling particularly unhappy or vengeful - make sure mit regrets rejecting you\n\nAnd lastly, just a reminder that don't lose hope. There's always something good you can do - irrespective of which uni you end up going to. In the long run, personal drive is what makes the biggest difference so make sure you don't lose that drive and hunger",

For me my stats is not as impressive as many of you guys, and it really shows that the process does not reflect your abilities and chances at other colleges too! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be accepted in Regular action, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to find the school that is the best fit for us!",

If I recall this makes for about 1 in 50 internationals being admitted, probably last year and this year even less. What I'm saying is that it has *absolutely nothing* to do with you or your potential to do amazing things in your country or any country and throughout the world. Keep up the good work and remember that college should never be the end goal, only an aid to accomplish whatever you plan to do in life.",

Student ambassador and MUN\n\nI guess it\u2019s probably because we are internationals, which make things a lot worse. Also this year if you are from China/ Taiwan, things probably go bad. 50% less admitted students in early rounds",

    "postText": "Hi there!\n\nI'm an international student, living in Nigeria, and I was wondering if we could still update our applications after submitting them?\n\nI ask this because as of now, since I want to pursue Physics and because this place is pretty bad for it, I have to add more to my ECs. And no, it's not forcibly or anything, it's just that, I have some major exams coming up and I have 3 projects lined up:\n\n1. Launching a clubs-system for my whole school.\n\n2. Writing my second research paper.\n\n3. Actually building something out of all the blueprints I've made.\n\nAgain, I have no time right now to do any of this because of my exams. So, is there any way to edit?\n\nThanks for your help in advance!!!",

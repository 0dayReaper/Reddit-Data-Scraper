    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm an international student. Based on your answer to my following question, I will decide wether I will be applying to MIT next year or not. \n\nI was a member in the national math team. I solved a problem in the APMO (Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad) correctly but for some reason, the national committee didn't send my paper. So, I got an unofficial honorable mention. If I wrote this in my application, would admission officers consider it? Any advice is appreciated\n\nNote: I will be applying with three gap years :(",

    "postText": "I am a high school senior student in Korea, and I found this subreddit few minutes ago, searching for something that would be helpful for my decision. I know that it's too late to decide whether I'll apply or not.. And so, I've already made the decision. But the reason I'm writing this post is just because I want to guess if this is just a 'daydream' or a visible 'goal' for me.\n\nFirst, why I wanted to apply MIT was because there's so much things that most of the Korean undergraduate programs are unable to provide. I can choose my major slowly enough, and I can expand my horizon there, interacting with students and professors from diverse backgrounds.\n\nBut I know that I won't get admitted for such a great school only with my great passion towards physics and MIT.. And yes, this is what matters the most. Our family is not rich enough to support my admission, so I have to carefully decide how much I will invest in this process(such as fee for TOEFL test and translation fee of my SSR), considering whether it is worthy or not.\n\nWhat is hopeful is that I've got two medals from International Astronomy Olympiads(one silver and one bronze). But what concerns me a lot is that I have no AP or SAT scores since I was educated in a completely 'Korean' system.. So I have no standardized test scores. Since MIT is such a great school and many of the applicants are as competent as the school is, that makes me so frustrating. To write some more about me, for accurate advice, my GPA is almost 4.0, since I've got straight As except for Sports in my second year. And I've also attended several summer physics camps of Korean universities.\n\nI just want to get some advice, if my hope(of applying to MIT) is just a daydream or it's not so hopeless as I think. I really want to thank all of you who read this post by here. Since English is my secondary language, can you please excuse me with grammar errors or typos?",

Your medals will add significantly to your application, but olympiad medals do not guarantee admission. Start working on your essays, and make sure they represent you as a person. Also, if you have the time, apply to some more US universities as your medals will give you a good chance of merit based scholarships at less selective universities. Most colleges are test-optional, so there is no need of taking the sat.",

However, you should try to research all different types of colleges: public, private, Ivy League, liberal arts, etc. Find ones you like, not ones that necessarily rank high on the rankings (MIT is #4 I believe, definitely apply if you have the tools or if you think it\u2019s a good option).

If you think additional information will give us a more thorough impression of you, please respond\" I wrote about how much I loved the campus and how I went to info sessions and stuff.

Take a year off, get sick, or just have a bad semester? Feel that your commitments at home prevented you from taking part in extra curriculars? You should primarily use this space to express the reasons and outcome of your unique circumstances. If you don\u2019t have to explain something like this, feel free to talk about something else you love, but it may not affect your application. I\u2019m certainly not privy to the admissions process.",

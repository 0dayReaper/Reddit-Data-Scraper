    "postText": "I have AP tests. I took english, spanish, and physics 1. I got fours across the board. I know that AP tests are self reported. Is a 4 in physics good enough to submit? Or should I leave it out because a five would be better? And are the other two subject worth submitting(if a 4 is worth it) even though I am applying to the mother of all STEM school?",

    "postText": "Will I need to apply as a transfer student?\n\nI got an exciting internship and I\u2019m currently a junior in high school. It will last about 6 months, but it will require that I am a student at my local 4 year university. I am planning on graduating HS early to attend the university for the next year to take more challenging classes in general. I was wondering if I could apply to mit in the this fall so I may be admitted next year. Will I need to apply as a transfer student? Will my application be considered differently?\nThanks.",

Keep in mind that the acceptance rate for transfer students is much, much lower than for incoming first-years",

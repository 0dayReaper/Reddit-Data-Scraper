    "postText": "**Should I still apply to go to MIT if I have a 3.7 GPA and a 1520 SAT (800 Math SAT) I'm doing an internship at MIT Lincoln Lab, and I'm part of a robotic team there as well. The reason why I have a bad GPA was due to covid and doing virtual school. In my freshman year I got a 3.56 GPA, sophomore year I got a 2.821 GPA(My first year of taking honors courses I took 4) that year I didn't do very well, I had family problems and we were still doing virtual school with covid. Fast forward to this year we are fully in person and I\u2019ve learned from my mistakes at the time of this school year for my junior year I have a 4.2 GPA (I only take two honors classes this year and one of them I still have a perfect 100). In addition, this year I also have 95 and above and all of my classes this year. Next year for my senior year I plan to take 4 honors classes and 2 APs, and hopefully to get to retake SAT to get a better reading score. So after all this information do you think it\u2019s worth writing an essay and applying? What do you think my chances are?**",

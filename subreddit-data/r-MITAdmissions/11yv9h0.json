    "postText": "\nI\u2019m a junior and recently just decided that I want to get into technology. I have a 3.9 GPA. I know MIT is basically the top schools when it comes to that field and I want to know if I have a chance of getting in. I\u2019m in robotics but I just joined this year and i\u2019m taking AP Computer Science A. I haven\u2019t taken my SATs yet but I just want to know if I should even try applying? I\u2019m interested in AI a lot as well and just wanted to know what I could do to help boost my application when it comes to CS.",

The majority of geniuses and ultra competitive applicants get rejected every year. I would definitely apply if interested though. The interview is a cool experience. \n\nAs far as boosting your resume, I would suggest getting an internship in coding or ,even better, developing your own code and publishing an app on the App Store.\n\nI hope this helps and good luck!",

            "comment": "I'm still in highschool but my sometimes childish obsession about this uni has taught me a bit about this process.\n\nYou're almost always not going to get in, unless you're incredible &amp; exceptional in one or more ways. MIT wants people who can do great things even without it. So my suggestion is to not care too much about MIT and pursue stuff you enjoy and that you think is meaningful to the world with as much effort you can and hope that it turns into something fruitful. If it does, then woilla! you've become what you thought you'd become when you reach MIT even before you got there and if it doesn't you've still challenged yourself and grown into something a bit more wonderful\n\nHere are some activities you can try\n\n1. Doing CS research with universities\n2. Starting a website/app\n3. Internships\n4. Making a blog\n5. Building robots and making youtube videos of them\n6. Doing research by yourself on ideas you find interestingThese are all ideas that you can do to fulfil yourself and also as a means of showing the uni you're applying to, that you care about CS\n\nI'll add more stuff to this comment later. It's getting late here",

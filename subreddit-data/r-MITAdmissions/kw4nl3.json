My 11th-grade teachers must have a really good impression of me\n\nHow can I prepare to get the best possible letters of reccomendation?",

This is general advice that will help your letters for all colleges you apply to. Disclaimer, I just applied to MIT EA and got deferred to RD (like most applicants). \n\nYour letters while important, is not what you should be focusing on rn, work on an array of projects or a hobby you plan to share with universities (for me it was app development for example)",

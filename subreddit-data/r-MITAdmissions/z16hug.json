    "postText": "I write short stories and poetry, and it's something. I really love and it is very important to me. But, MIT doesn't accept a creative writing portfolio. My tow main question are:\n\n1. Why don't they accept a creative writing portfolio? Is it that it is too easy for an applicant to cobble something together and call themself a writer? Is it that they don't want to have to trudge through a ton of bad student poetry?\n2. I built a website with html/css that I share my writing on and will put that in my maker portfolio with a bunch of other projects I've created. Is submitting my writing through a website I built  gaming the system or something? Will they read my stories and poetry there?",

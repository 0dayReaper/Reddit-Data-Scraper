I have applied to MIT as early action and noticed that despite being already like 20+ days my transcripts are still not showing.\n\nI uploaded them electronically so I would expect them to receive them immediately (since my letters of recommendation showed as soon as I completed my application).\n\nWhat do you recommend I do? I emailed them and they haven\u2019t replied yet... should I try upload again and see if it was a mistake in the upload process?",

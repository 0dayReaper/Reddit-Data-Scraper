What subjects should I take if want to do mechanical engineering? The subject requirements weren't clear online. And what do I need to get into MIT? I know the essay and MIT, but what else is required?",

Its kind of unorganized, unlike math and physics where the concepts just 'flow' from one topic to the next. Maybe im just not cut out for chemistry (which is okay because im fine with a 6). SL chemistry is divided into 10 chapters (if i recall correctly) and then 4 optional topics from which you have to chose 1 (this is your paper 3). Theres organic and inorganic chemistry both.",

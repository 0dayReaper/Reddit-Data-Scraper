    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI am a freshman in high school, and I am considering going d3 for swimming. MIT would be one of my top schools (a longtime dream since the 3rd grade) and I was wondering how you would go about being recruited as a student-athlete and how to get into the college academically. Currently, my schedule is as rigorous as I can possibly make it (all honors classes except for foreign language, gym, and APHUG) I do many extracurriculars as well (Model UN, Academic Team, Debate, Morgan's Message, Interact, and of course, school and club swim) my best events are 400 IM, 200 IM, 200 BK, and 100 BK, all of which are in the range of MIT swimmer's times on Swimcloud.\n\nWhen/How should I start getting in contact with coaches? How do you begin the recruiting process? Who should I talk to, and which courses should I take?\n\nAdditionally, I am not really a STEM person, as of now, I would like to major in political sciences, International Relations, or something of that sort.\n\nThank you!",

Email the coach in the early fall of sr year. \n\nInclude in the email your swim times so they can quickly sort if you're in the ballpark or not. \n\nThey'll help you from there.\n\nBeing recruited by a sport can help you a little, but it's not the biggest thing on your application for getting in. In other words, if you like swimming do it, but don't do it to get into MIT.",

The process at MIT is very academic-stats-focused\u2026 coaches will politely tell you e.g., \u201cyour video looks great, your transcript is good, but I\u2019d really like to see your SAT a little higher\u201d.  A coach watching athletes at a national competition last year stated they were there to watch &gt;200 kids play (that had previously contacted them), and of those, only ~20 would be academically viable for admissions. Of that subset, the coach will prioritize based on needs\u2026 if the team is graduating all their IM/backstroke talent the year you apply, that helps, but even with a LOR/nod from the coach, admissions still has to like your application\u2026 the LOR from a coach can help , but they\u2019ll probably only get ~20% of their recommendations accepted (and the coach will not recommend athletes without the academic creds consistent with MIT admissions). My experience is that some athletes started reaching out to coaches in sophomore year to begin building relationships (this maybe more key if the team only has a need for one of your particular skill set)\u2026 most initiated connections after sophomore year\u2026 a few waited until senior year. So\u2026 takeaways: focus on academics and fill out online form late sophomore early junior year: https://mitathletics.com/sports/2021/4/20/information-Recruiting-Team-Recruitment-Forms.aspx. I\u2019d actually go to the sport-specific page and look under recruiting links to make sure you have current form when the time comes.",

For my sport, you'd email the coach, they'd ask you about your stats and you're GPA/SATs (they didn't want to waste time with students who couldn't get in). They'd then have a conversation about your interest where they'd try to sell yo on the team. You'd do a campus tour in the fall and meet the team. If they thought, 1) you were good enough for the team 2) interested in MIT 3) academically able to get in then they'd put your on their list for admissions. Honestly, it was pretty easy to tell #1 but they had to put more energy into #2 and #3. \n\nMy sport was rather small so the coaches had a decent awareness of most of the top tier high school athletes already. They coached summer programs and clinics for high schoolers as a stealth of recruiting while also cashing in from parents who wanted their kids to have exposure to college coaches. \n\nAlso, My sport wasn't NCAA so maybe they have different or stricter rules. Email the coach. I'm sure they get a ton of emails and have a template response for over eager freshmen that should give you a definitive answer.",

What that really means is that they won\u2019t bend admissions standards to let a good athlete in simply because they\u2019re an athlete.  But if you are an athlete who meets academic standards, then that can certainly be a feather in your cap come admissions time",

    "postText": "Getting in to MIT\n\nAlright this might sound dumb or impossible to ask on Reddit, but I\u2019m a 16 year old kid who really wants to get into MIT, I\u2019m Canadian but have been studying for the SAT, and I have really good grades but what I\u2019m worried about is my extracurriculars. I wanna make a difference in the world, one that helps people so I\u2019ve started with small things like volunteering at my school, coaching volleyball and playing it and some tutoring, I\u2019ve also participated in senior physics Olympics and placed 6th/60 in a category, but I just know it\u2019s not enough and I thought it couldn\u2019t hurt to ask for some help.",

            "comment": "Well, you can always \"do better\" but that's not helpful because not everyone at MIT is the best possible person from their school or state.\n\nWhat you're already doing is great. Anyone can get good grades or test scores, so definitely keep doing that, and then as for extracurriculars, **do what you're passionate about.**\n\nIf you have the grades / tests, then you're put into the pool of applications that are reviewed by admissions, and that's where you have to shine. So my advice is to start thinking about your essays: craft a narrative of what you're passionate about and how your experiences prove that you've pursued those passions.\n\nFor example, I was super into writing and art, so I was involved in the yearbook &amp; newspaper at my school: just an article writer for yearbook, but I climbed to Editor-in-Chief of the newspaper. And my essays talk about the fun experiences I had.\n\nSo you want to make a difference in the world by tutoring, coaching, and competing. Talk about that in your essays, get your foot in the door by doing well on tests, and you'll come into MIT!",

            "comment": "Dog, just got accepted to MIT literally 6 hours ago, feeling unreal. \n\nYeah what he said is pretty true. I\u2019m absolutely floored that I got in at all.  I Have a good ACT, 4.0 GPA, all that jazz, but I\u2019m no tech wizard, or some math Olympiad\u2014 I didn\u2019t even mention any technology stuff on my application and I applied for computer engineering\u2026 and I think that\u2019s why I got in. \n\nInstead of tech, I talked about my passion for designing board games, my families mixed racial background, my volunteering at a summer camp, and how I designed a house of cards for a national competition (it wasn\u2019t a card competition, it was a surface level art competition that I entered with \u201c3D art\u201d which was super ambitious and hard but made for an amazing engineering and persevere and essay) in my essays. \n\nMy point is: there might have been other kids with stuff like you that got rejected today, but I broke the zone that everyone else was doing. My Ecs aren\u2019t as impressive at face value I think, but mit has a butt crap ton of kids with the impressive stuff. They need creativity and unique thingamajigs and all that razzmatazz. \n\nSo find some kooky stuff and bring it. Write essays about the narrative like bro said, and make yourself stand out as , yes, and Olympiad but also an avid birdhouse designer who has competed on a national level (can\u2019t be that hard to find a comp to enter, right?) or something like that, idk, you\u2019re creative.",

I was in my schools marching band, and we practiced mondays Tuesdays thursdays and Fridays from 4:30-8 after school from July to November, with comps on weekends, so I had literally no time to write during these months. It was worth it tho to do band. \n\nI ended up GRINDING during winter break. I mean I threw away december for this man. I came home every day and wrote essays and tweaked and fine tunes and rewrote and sent out and got feedback for weeks. I left the house twice during all of winter break. I know that sounds bad, and I kinda regret it, but I got in so it\u2019s worth it. My motivation the entire time was \u201cI really Want this, and I did not put in all of this time and sweat and effort to give up now because it seems hard!\u201d And I GRINDED, dude. Those essays? That\u2019s like at least the 7th version or later of each one. My dad would review what I had done every night and k would work on making edits on til late, then wake up and work til he got home from work, then repeat. \n\nI know it sounds rough, and it really was. It was an unhealthy work schedule (I HIGHLY recommend using pomodoro method of studying: it\u2019s a website called pomofocus.something and it\u2019s basically a work 25 minutes, 5 minute break timer. I used that thing an insane amount. \n\nBut to answer your question, it\u2019s never too early to start I think. Having anything going into app season is better than nothing. Of course, you can rewrite stuff whenever you feel like it\u2019s not showing you",

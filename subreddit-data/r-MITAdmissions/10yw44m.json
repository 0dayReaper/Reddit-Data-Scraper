There is no secret formula, just be a human being who cares. \n\nAs per Olympic medals, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s much of a question. If you can, of course it would be amazing to have them, but also don\u2019t get discouraged if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s completely fine. \n\nChallenge yourself if it\u2019s what makes you feel happy and keeps you going, they want to see people who try their best to go above and beyond. Best of luck with all your endeavors. \n\n(And a little personal tip I can give you is: explore as much as you can. I discovered a lot of new interests by delving into areas that seemed foreign to me (an example would be Model UN))",

Can you contact companies who do it and get an internship? Can you contact local university professors and start working for them? Can you take classes in it and start some activity/club yourself?\nI interview kids who want to get in, and this is the most important thing I look for. \nAlso, really look at MIT and figure out what makes it special, and why you want to attend. Talk to alumni about it. Find people who took the career path you are interested and really get to the bottom of what they love about their work, their career path, and what they would do differently.",

Find something challenging you enjoy and pursue it. \n\nUltimately, this is a pie eating contest where the prize is more pie. So, you had better really like pie if you are going to focus on training up for it.\n\nIf you are the type of kid who loves these things, do them and push yourself to do them as thoroughly and as best you can. \n\nIf you do not love these things, then consider whether you would be happier at a college where there is more of a balance and where you won\u2019t need God-tier ECs to get in.",

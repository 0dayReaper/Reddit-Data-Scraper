    "postText": "Hi!\n\nDo not pay attention to the English, I put this in Spanish in another reddit that apparently is inactive, so to put it here I put it through the google translator, sorry.\n\nI am Argentine, I am 22 years old, I wanted to ask you what real possibility I have to enter MIT, I know that the students who enter are few and the foreigners are much less, the thing is that when I finished high school I did not see the need to study in a Argentina's university (partly because I met graduates from the \"best\" Argentine university that left much to be desired), because when I was little I learned programming and when the 6 years passed until I finished school I had already had a lot of practice in Data Science and AI, and a company gave me the push to enter the IT market, today I am an ML engineer for a big american company, however I always wanted to get into MIT but I know that age can be a problem (I took the SAT and ACT and did very well, above or equal to what they recommend to get into MIT.). What do you think?  \n\n\nThanks for your time!",

    "postText": "&gt;SUBJECT: Letter of recommendation received  \nBODY: Hi thifting,  \nWe are reaching out to let you know that we've received your letter of recommendation from \\[name of recommender\\]. Please remember we'll add a checklist to your status page so you can see everything we've received two weeks after the application deadline.  \nThank you,  \nMIT Admissions\n\nI got this email twice, once for one of my teacher recs and once for my counselor within the last two weeks. How are they only receiving this now?? did they only evaluate my application with my one humanities teacher recommender?",

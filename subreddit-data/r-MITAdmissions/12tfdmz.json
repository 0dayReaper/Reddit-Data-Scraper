    "postText": "First of all, let me give a little situational preview. I'm a 17 years old, South Asian girl, currently in 11 grade, living in FL. I came to America about 4-5 years ago. For 3 of those years, I had no idea what I was doing- I just followed whatever my folks who lived here were telling me. I personally was and am interested in engineering, but because of my uncle-aunties' pressure on how hard it is, it kind of stopped me from looking into what I want to do in the future.\n\nDuring the amid of COVID-19 AKA at the end of my 10th grade, I heard about MIT. At that time I was also looking into other colleges and majors. There are many colleges that I like, but MIT hits almost all my requirements. It has a good male-female ratio; has both astrophysics and Aerospace Engineering; also has the opportunity for double majoring; is very far away from where I live( I am trying to run away \ud83d\ude0e jkjk); last of all but the most important one- a cousin of my said I shouldn't because it might be too hard for me. So, now I just have to do it, and if I  don't, I'll just drive off of a cliff.\n\nAlso, a little preview of my academic background from back in my country and in here- I was not a very bright student, my whole goal was to just get above 50. After I got here, I realized education here is not really hard. To my surprise, there were times when I was the smartest person in the class and that's embarrassing. I know who I am, and I understand my abilities very well. So, yes, that's embarrassing. But, surprisingly this motivated me and now I seek academic validation from everyone. I'd rather have someone call me smart than be my friend. So, now I pretty much have quite hardcore classes(it's not really that bad). I'm also from a school that has quite a bad reputation, even the teachers there say the same, EVERY SINGLE TEACHER SAYS THAT. The only goal; they have is to make sure the kids graduate, they don't care about their academics. This shows in the way they assign teachers, for example- They have 3 to 5 math teachers for Pre-Algebra to Algebra 2 and 1 teacher for Pre-cal, AICE CAL, and AICE STATS. They recently added 2 courses, College Algebra and AICE Pre-Cal, because too many kids were failing Pre-Cal. I'm talking so much about my school cause I hope MIT doesn't look into that, or this doesn't make a difference. \n\nAlso, I didn't say all this to get sympathy or have you guys pity me or inflict some sort of emotional connection, I am just trying to get yall on the same boat as me to give a better analysis.  I mean I wouldn't get an opportunity for a background transcript where I can talk about all this \ud83d\ude2d.  So, I just want someone who works there or literally anyone to give me advice. Now let's get into my academics-\n\nGPA= 3.6, on a 0 - 4.0 scale. \\[Current Year GPA= 3.8\\]\n\nCumulative Weighted GPA= 4.1189, on a 0 - 6.0 scale. \\[Current Year Weighted GPA= 4.7\\]\n\nClass Rank= 54/544\n\nCourse-\n\n9th grade\n\nGeo Hon: B; Intense Read: A; English 1: A; Digital Info Tech: A; PE: B; World HIST: A; PHY SCI: A.\n\n10th grade\n\nBio 1: A; AICE GLBL PERSP AS: A; AICE ENG GEN PAPER: A, Alg: A; AVID1: A, ECON Hon: A, AMER GOV: A;\n\nIntense Read 2: B (I failed Intence Read 1 by 6 points, So I had to retake it)\n\n11 grade\n\nAICE US HIST AS: B; AICE DIGITAL MED&amp;DESG: A; CHEM 1: A; Pre-Cal Hon: A; Bio-Science Hon: A; AICE ENG LANG AS: A; Research 1: A. \n\nAlso taking CHINESE 1 online- My grade is A. \n\nI also tried Dual Enroll and took \"Microcomputer\" and \"College Algebra\" during the summer after 10th grade. \n\nMicrocomputer: B \\[I could've gotten an A if I wasn't being a lazy prick\\] \n\nCollege Algebra: F \\[ I was out of the country for 1 month and could not connect to the workplace. Didn't realize until I got there, and tried emailing them, but no one answered\\] \n\nSAT: 1160 \\[11 grade\\], I know MIT doesn't look at SAT anymore, but, I will take this again to soot my ego. \n\nMy school doesn't give AP/IB, but they will start from my 12th-grade year, so I'll probably take some of those. \n\nFor 12th grade, I'm taking-\n\nAP-Cal, AP Human Geography, AICE ENG LIT, AICE Marine Science, AP Physics Online, AP Art/ 2-D Studio Art 1, Technical Design II, African American History Hon. \\[I know it's a lot, but I love being a hardboiled egg, I got this\\]\n\nEC:\n\nClubs-\n\n\\- Member of Newspaper Club\n\n\\- Member of Art Club\n\n\\- Member of The Stevens Initiative \n\n\\- Member of 1000 Girls 1000 Futures\n\n\\- Girls Who Code Summer Program\n\nCompetition-\n\n\\- \\*city name\\* Regional Science and Engineering Fair\n\n\\- The Junior Academy Research Project\n\nVolunteer Service-\n\n\\- Street Art Festival, 36 hours, 2022, 2023.\n\n\\[I applied to MITES and got rejected. So, I freaked out and started writing this. I also got rejected from the Questbrigde scholar match. So, after, I'm typing all these, Imma go, cry\\]\n\nSo, what I need from the folks of this sub is to tell me if I have any chance and what can I do to improve my possibilities. I think I just really need to write a good essay, but I also think that alone isn't enough. I mean the high-almighty words of my essay need to meet my ECs and coursework. \n\nAlso, PPPLLLEEEAAASSSEEE give me some advice on EC, because I don't know what to do. Literally, anything will work. I just wanna spend this summer properly. I draw and like math a lot. So I join some competitions. I'm also thinking of starting to play tennis next year. \n\nI also am thinking of applying to Questbrigde National College Match, So should I?",

(Depends on major) over the summer and get higher chance",

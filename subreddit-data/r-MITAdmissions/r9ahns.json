    "postText": "MIT offers credit for very few ap courses. I\u2019ll be reporting six scores, three of which turned out as 4. I got 4s in the physics c exams, but my school doesn\u2019t offer those courses. I also got 4 on the APUSH exam. I got 5s on stats, calc BC (my school also doesn\u2019t offer calc BC) and Lang.\n\nWill this ruin my app if I mention it?\n\nThanks?",

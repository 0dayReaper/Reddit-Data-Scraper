    "postText": "Sooooo title.\n\nI\u2019ve been held back twice because of homeschooling for at least my whole middle school days and due to that, I\u2019m a 17 year old sophomore. Nice. \n\nFreshman year I was pretty rocky during the year, but the last semester I turned things around rq and had like a 3.7-4.0 gpa, it was great. \n\nI\u2019m taking all advanced classes (with the exception of an Honors course being band and World Studies, while also taking AP Psych), but the one class that is not is my math. I\u2019m in Algebra 1 CP. \n\nSo my question is, are my chances of getting into an Ivy-League like MIT, slim because of this? Will this hinder my future if I want to get into a good Ivy-League college? Math was never really my strong suit and unfortunately I\u2019m taking a CP course. For more info, I am looking to get a degree in Computer Science so that\u2019s why I REALLY want to get into MIT. \n\nSo I ask: am I screwed?",

There are so many great colleges out there that kids that are just as smart go to. For example, I am planning on going to my state\u2019s public school and I have a 1580 on the SAT for reference. Still, I would encourage u to apply cus u miss 100% of the shots u dont take",

Why apply to a school that requires exceptional math aptitude?  Sheer stubbornness?  Time to face up to who you are and who you aren't, and make your career plans accordingly.  This ain't gonna work.",

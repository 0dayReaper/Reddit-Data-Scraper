    "postText": "I'm graduating with a degree in finance and a certificate in data science from the University of Wisconsin next year. I will only graduate with one internship (in private equity), as I only took two years in undergrad.\n\nI'm looking at applying to the MIT master's of finance program to pursue a degree in financial engineering following my graduation from undergrad, but I have a few questions.\n\n1. MIT admissions says they don't require specific classes, but that many students have experience in multivariable calculus, linear algebra, stats, and probability. Since I don't have any experience in multivariable calculus or linear algebra, should I take a class on one of these topics in undergrad to improve my chances? I can only add one class while still graduating on time, so I'm not sure if this would even make a difference (as I wouldn't have experience in all subjects).\n2. Would taking Coursera or EdX courses on multivariable calculus/linear algebra to supplement my lack of those courses in undergrad help my chances at getting into the program, or would those not really mean much? Has anyone done this?\n\nAny other general advice or comments would be appreciated!",

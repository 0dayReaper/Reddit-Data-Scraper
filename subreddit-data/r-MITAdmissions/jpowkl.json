With the massive volume of applicants they have, any reason will do, and refusing to follow the procedures is one of them.  You've probably wasted your time and the fee.\n\nThe rule isn't a power game, it's just a way to make sure the recommendation letters are honest and objective.  By the way, you don't get to see the interview report, either.  If they were written in the knowledge that the applicant would see them and anything said would get back to the writers, they'd be bland and useless.  If you know of any other college that permits it, that would be interesting to know.",

That means finding a certain number of people who express interest in certain majors, certain number of people who are into certain hobbies, and, yes, a certain number of athletes. It\u2019s an art, not a science, and there are no published acceptance rates for these types of things. Just know that it\u2019s a valuable part of your application.",

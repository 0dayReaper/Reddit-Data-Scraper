    "postText": "Hey, guys! I'm a high school senior looking to apply to MIT. I contacted Dr. Grant (MIT Director of Athletics) through his email address on the MIT staff directory about sports in general as I'm willing to play pretty much any sport except volleyball and basketball, but I didn't get a response. Should I contact individual coaches, or should I contact Dr. Grant again through the same/different means? Thanks! c:",

I've also done wrestling since 6th grade and am planning on participating in the winter season. Other than that, I've done swimming, soccer, running/cross country, track, baseball, and a scoche of basketball and lacrosse. Also, could you explain in layman's terms what you mean by \"walk ons\" and how MIT recruits athletes?",

    "postText": "My friend had an interview scheduled the day before EA results come out and they cancelled it saying it wouldn't affect their decision at all. He is depressed because this means that either he got in and they don't need an interview or he got rejected and likewise. If he got deferred they would've done the interview still. Is bro doomed or are we overthinking?",

Yes. Is he doomed? Probably not!\n\nWhat I would ask is, if deferred, do you get another interview if they couldn't offer you one during EA. I think so, right? Because they try to offer RA applicants interviews aswell.\n\nOn the bright side, imagine he gets in without an interview, the ego boost! ;)",

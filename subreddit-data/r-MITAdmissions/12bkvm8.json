    "postText": "I am a high school sophomore who is looking into colleges and is very interested in MIT. I am interesting in civil engineering, and when I look on the site, the requirements to apply is just to take certain school courses, but when I ask some senior friends of mine, they said that I need an engineering portfolio with engineering projects? Is that true, and if so, how do I form one and what are some projects I can do to fill it up?",

(They're not trying to trick you! Don't worry about what friends say, they don't have access to any more information than you do.)",

Put your time towards something you're passionate about &amp; that's rewarding regardless of if you're accepted or not. If that's not home engineering projects, a portfolio probably isn't a good idea. Just don't spend your free time doing nothing.",

I used to interview high-school seniors for MIT, and I loved it when students just built cool things.\n\n* Take some of the [CivE classes](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?q=civil+engineering) on [ocw.mit.edu](https://ocw.mit.edu) in your leisure, in the summer.\n* Try to find out which subarea of Civil Engineering piques your interest, perhaps by checking out the research areas of the [MIT Course 1 (Civil/Environmental Engineering) faculty](https://cee.mit.edu/faculty/).\n* See if you can find someone in your parents' or school's network in the field who might let you shadow, volunteer, or intern with them over the summer. If you don't have anyone in your network, cold-email people. They'll be impressed with your initiative, and I'd be glad to help you draft/edit your cold email to them.\n* Build something. Start small and manageable. Google DIY civil engineering projects. Start small, cheap, and manageable. Work up from there.\n* Start a civil engineering club at your school or something related. Go to conferences or competitions together or build things together. \n* Whatever else you can think of to explore the field to make sure you're really interested and to establish a track record of interest and success. I'm out of ideas from the top of my head. :)",

I have sent out a couple of cold emails to college professors at the university near me, but I have not heard back in months lmao. I\u2019m most interested in starting a club. Do you know how to sign up for the conferences once I make a club and what the requirements are?",

Each program will have its own signup directions. You may need to raise a bit of money from parents to cover the expenses.",

    "postText": "MIT states the minimum IELTS score to apply is 7, will a student with a 7 be disadvantaged in any way compared to another student with an 8 or 9? Will the AOs consider the EPT scores as a differentiating factor at any point in the selection process (e.g., if there's a situation where they MUST ACCEPT either of the two applicants)?\n\nOr just crossing the threshold is enough?",

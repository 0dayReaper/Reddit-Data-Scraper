How is the interview dynamic?\n\nDo interviewers have access to my application?\nIf projects are mentioned, do they ask a lot of technical stuff?\n\nSorry, I am an international student and did not expect to get one, therefore I am really nervous...",

            "comment": "It is meant to be informal and casual. There is no set of standard questions, so just be prepared to talk about yourself, your experiences, and MIT. Alumni volunteer to do the interviews, and they do not have access to your application. It is also a chance for you to ask them about their experiences at MIT. The best you can do is to stay relaxed (but still act professionally) and try not to be too nervous.",

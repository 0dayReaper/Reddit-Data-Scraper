I've been told it should be in the top right of the screen, but I don't see it, even on desktop.\n\n\n2) I accidentally left the \"extenuating circumstances\" part of my application blank when I shouldn't have. Would it be acceptable to email admissions to ask to correct the issue?\n\n\nThank you!",

    "postText": "Hello, I am a junior thinking of applying to mit, but I\u2019m worried about my awards and honors. Most of my awards are from local tech competitions and presentations I have given on aerospace engineering and flight simulation ( 2 projects I\u2019ve been working on for years). Will mit even care about these kind of awards. I know most people getting in have national awards and things which I do not have.",

            "comment": "the whole awards thing is way overblown by people who try to \u2018solve\u2019 the admissions process. it\u2019s cliche, but you really should just [apply sideways](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying_sideways/). i didn\u2019t have any awards and i\u2019m here, and i couldn\u2019t tell you how or why. i also couldn\u2019t tell you how any of my friends got in, or if any of them have awards. try to get out of the mindset of \u2018grinding\u2019 for college applications in advance. i personally think grinding can only work against you.",

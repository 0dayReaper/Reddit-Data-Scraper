    "postText": "Hey guys, had a question about the MIT application. I know MIT has its own application, not like others which use Common app or Coalition, but I was wondering when the application would open this year? It says the \"last week of august\" on the website, but is that this week or next week? I'm not from the United States, so I don't know much about how the application works.\n\nThanks in advance!",

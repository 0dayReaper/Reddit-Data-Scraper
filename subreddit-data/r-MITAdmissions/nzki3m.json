            "comment": "Current student here. Your ec's and accomplishments are good (certainly better than mine were). The acceptance rate is 6.7%, and since your ec's are above average, you probably have a slightly higher chance. Realistically, it will come down to how well you can present yourself, your personality, and your accomplishments on your application. Even if you do that, there is still a major luck factor involved. If you want to go to MIT, apply.  But be realistic, don't count on getting in.",

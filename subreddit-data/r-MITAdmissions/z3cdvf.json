There are a list of reasons for eligibility including family income, whether or not your school receives free lunches, etc. You can also call MIT admissions and ask the process for applying for the waiver if you can\u2019t find answers on their website or in the application. Definitely research first before calling MIT and don\u2019t give too many details over the phone - just a quick call to find link.",

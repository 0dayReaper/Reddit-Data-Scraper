    "postText": "I sent an email about scheduling an interview, but have heard no reply back after several days. I know MIT's spring semester starts on Monday, so my interviewer may be trying to enjoy the rest of their break (which is what I'm assuming and why I haven't emailed them again). With that being said, how many days should I wait before sending a follow-up email?",

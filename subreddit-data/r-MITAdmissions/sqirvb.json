    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of questions related to MIT admissions:\n\nAnyone knows how US high school student  with EAD (waiting for green card) treated for MIT undergrad application? (Ref: Parents from HonKong/Singapore on work visa in US. sophomore-senior 3 years of high school in U.S and before that in Singapore.  It is unclear if we get the green card before the decision time. Are the odds in favor for being an international from U.S?\n\n2nd question:  Besides the 'letter text' itself, what else do the 'recommender' needs to fill in on the MIT letter of recommendation portal? Does he/she have to explain about his/her position, expertise etc., ? This is specifically about the supplemental letter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

My dad writes letters of recommendation to his students for graduate program, which apparently has fields to write about (expertise etc., ). From what you mentioned, looks like it is different for undergraduate programs.",

I am much closer to getting the green card, but unfortunately not yet in a position to say I have it:-( \n\nThe only fine print here is that EAD is almost on the finishing line of physical green card (It is not clear if the green card approval happens in the next 3 weeks). The USCIS think EAD is as good as green card, but colleges unfortunately, don't realize the nuances and finer details of the USCIS complications.",

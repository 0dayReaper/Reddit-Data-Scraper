The biggest problem is \"I don't see their entire application\" so I have no clue what is really going on. We might see less than the tip of the iceberg...\n\nTypically transfer applicants are very solid (e.g., one Nigerian guy was on Dean's List at the University of Michigan -- Chemical Engineering). Again, I don't know his reasons for transferring. I did see he had some extracurriculars.\n\nOne year the three internationals who transferred all had various International Olympiad involvement and hardware, but that's obviously \"not normal\" for all transfers.",

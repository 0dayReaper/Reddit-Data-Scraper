    "postText": "I applied early action and got deferred. I sent my SAT score but not my ACT, which I took last year. My composite score was a 34 with sub-scores of 35, 32, 32, 35 for Math, Science, English, and Reading in that order. Given what I got and MIT's accepted student statistics, should I submit my ACT score now? Thank you in advance.",

Stick to it.\n\nSource: ACT-SAT Concordance Table, latest from 2018\n\n[https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/ACT-SAT-Concordance-Tables.pdf](https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/ACT-SAT-Concordance-Tables.pdf)",

The main reason I considered sending my ACT was almost solely for my 35 on ACT math (which is in the range for accepted students at MIT).  However, a 770 on SAT math is, like you said, basically equivalent so I guess that's good enough. And honestly I should be good in that regard as MIT knows from my transcript that I've taken through Calculus 3... idk",

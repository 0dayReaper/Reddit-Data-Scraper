            "comment": "I know you're probably tired of hearing this, but really, just list what makes you you the most. Try to show different aspects of yourself. So, yes, you should try to vary them a bit, condense where you can (e.g. if you did both private tutoring and taught small classes, just put them together. If you trained for football and you had to go to the gym for it, put them together, etc etc.), and if there's a fifth activity you think is crucial to your identity, you can talk about it in the additional section. \n\nAt MIT they want people who can do good, both for the school and the community in general, so make sure you let them see that. \n\nBest of luck!",

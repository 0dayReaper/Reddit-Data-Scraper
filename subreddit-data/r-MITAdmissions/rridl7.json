    "postText": "I'm an international student and my Freshman year was TERRIBLE. I had like 3 As - Computer Science, Mathematics, and a social studies class. I had 6 Bs - Phys, Bio, Chem, English Literature, English Language, Advanced Mathematics (only 8 or so people from my class were doing this), and I had a C in French (i sucked at it lmfao). I was, however, taking the most rigorous courseload. \n\nSince then however, I have gotten 9 A\\*s and 1A (french lol) in my Sophomore year in the same subects and then I did the IBDP starting from my junior year and I've gotten only 6s and 7s (almost, explained later) with a predicted grade of 42/45 - (7 in Comp Sci HL, 7 in Physics HL, 6 in Math AA HL, 7 in Spanish SL, 7 in Business SL and 6 in Eng Lit SL + 2 bonus points for EE &amp; TOK) with internal grades of 39/42, 38/42 and 38/42 across 2 semesters in my junior year and the first semester of my senior year. In my second semester of junior year, I did sadly get a 5 in Math AA HL but I think I have a valid reason to give to the AOs (a family member passed away due to COVID around the time I had a lot of math tests). So I have an upward trend in my grades and I think my grades since freshman year are pretty decent, not jaw dropping and perfect but I think have te awards/ECs (research with ex-MIT researcher - published in pretty big international journal soon, research with an oxford prof, government funding for a pretty big project - national recognition for the same, tech internships at reputable orgs, usaco gold hopefully plat in january/february, some school stuff blah blah) to boost my app a bit. \n\nSo can my freshman year hurt my chances cause like 6 Bs and 1C is BAD BAD? And also my school doesn't calculate a GPA + im test optional. Sorry im kinda panicking",

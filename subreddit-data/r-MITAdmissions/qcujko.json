Student was granted interview late in RD, but we think lack of physics &amp; calculus despite other high achievements was deciding factor. \nSo realistically, get physics &amp; calculus at AP or even community college level.\n\nStudent now has 4 semesters of college classes, as a 11/12 high school student, including Physics &amp; Calculus.",

I had the same problem.. i dropped physics in 11th grade but I took Calculus and has high score\nI dropped because during that time the exam cost burden me and was thinking that I already knew I want to major in Biochemistry\nI never thought that it will concern me now\nI'm applying for RD\nDo you have any idea how can I make up for this? I'm thinking of taking the AP Physics online courses in EdX.. what do you think?",

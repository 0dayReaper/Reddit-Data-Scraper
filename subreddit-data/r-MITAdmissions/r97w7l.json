    "postText": "Hey everyone, I applied EA to MIT and I submitted a 1530 SAT (only had a 750 math). The reason my math was so low is because I was only able to take the test this past June, a time in which I was severely concussed after sustaining an injury harsh enough to require facial reconstruction surgery- so my brain was extremely slow and I wasn\u2019t given extra time despite my efforts. However, my brain is in much better shape now and I just took another SAT today and likely got at least a 780 on the math. Here\u2019s my fear: What if I get rejected Early and never get the chance to submit this new score???? \n\nI\u2019m a recruited athlete for women\u2019s soccer so I\u2019m really hoping that boosts me into an area where I\u2019ll at least get deferred, but I\u2019m really nervous. I feel like I might\u2019ve messed up by applying early. This has just been on my mind a lot recently so I wanted to voice my concerns somewhere idk. Thanks for reading good luck to everyone else that applied!!",

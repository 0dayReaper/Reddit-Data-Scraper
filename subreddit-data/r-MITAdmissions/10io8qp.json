The interview went pretty good ig, she asked me about myself, my week, projects, future plans, etc... I also asked her about her experiences at MIT and branched out some questions. It lasted for about 1hr",

Don't worry nonetheless, interviews are based on availability so if there isn't anyone around you it'll be waived and your app won't be affected.",

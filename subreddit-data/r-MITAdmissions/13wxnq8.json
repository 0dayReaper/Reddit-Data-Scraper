    "postText": "I'm an 11th grade IB student in the UK (with American citizenship), and have a predicted IB score of 43/45:\n\n7 - Maths AA HL, 7 - Physics HL, 6 - Computer science HL, 7 - Geography SL, 7 - French SL, 6 - English SL\n\nI've got letters of recommendations from my principal, physics teacher, geography teacher, a physics professor from Rutgers (due to a project I did with him, involving using astronomy ) and from the CEO of a start-up aerospace company (also due to a project I did with him, involving research into competitors and designing their website). \n\nI've done many other personal engineering side projects, such as making a system to record the heat island effect in London, and designing a system that would self-stabilize a model rocket. I'm also part of my school's MUN team, and even won best delegate at an international conference. Finally, I've been voted in as Head boy of my school, by the staff and student body.\n\nI'm fully fluent in French and English, and can also understand Spanish. Most of my side-hobbies involve engineering and space, which is what I want to study at college. Both my parents also went to MIT: my Mum did undergrad, grad school and did her PHD there; and my dad did his PHD and then later became a professor there.\n\nThe only thing that isn't going for me is my SATs; I'm sitting them on the third of June, but I'm currently only getting about 1460 on the practice tests I'm doing under normal exam conditions. The reason for this is due to my Dyslexia and ADHD, which make it so I struggle to fully finish all the sections, even with the extra time I'm given. However, my accuracy on the questions that I do have time to finish is nearly 100%.\n\nAssuming I get a score of 1460 on my actual SATs, will this massively impact my application? Do I have much of a chance at all at being accepted? Finally, is it worth re-taking the SATs in September or October?\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated :)",

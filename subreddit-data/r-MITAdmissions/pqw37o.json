I hope y'all are doing well!  \nI am a senior in high school, international student, I haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet but my best practice score is 1450, my gpa is around 3.98, my ECs are National (in my country ofc) Math Olympiad medalist, National Informatics Olympiad medalist and represented my country in the International Informatics Olympiad (didn\u2019t do that well on that one), I have also founded two clubs in my school: English, and Math and Informatics. Before the pandmic, I participated in MUN, was part of the student council and got to be class president on my freshman year. My dream school is MIT.\n\nWhat mostly concerns me is that in my country we do not have AP classes, honors, etc, the curriculum is just the same for all, so there is bo way for me to take a rigorous curriculum as I always read about in posts.\n\nAlso I be applying for financial aid, which I read works against you.\n\nAnother thing is that my school has no idea of what a school report is or what recommendation letters are.I have also read that sometimes Test Scores for international students in each university tends to be lower but I don't know how true that is.\n\nDo you guys think I might be a good prospect for a top school in the US, specially MIT? If any international student is reading, How did you handle the situation with the school report and the recommendation letters?",

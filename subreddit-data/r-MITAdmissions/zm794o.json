    "postText": "Hello all!\n\nI have just wrapped up my third semester at community college. I am working on my RA at the moment for the fall term in 2023. For some academic background, I am a CS and Math major with a 4.0 GPA, and after next semester I will have completed the Calculus series, two calculus-based physics courses, three programming classes and a couple other maths and sciences (alongside the usual government, english, and history courses of course).\n\nMy test scores from high school aren't optimal, and neither were my grades if that matters. I don't have the most community service nor extracurricular activities.\n\nWith that being said, I was hoping to receive some input on how I should go about my application. What kind of things should I look for that can potentially set myself apart, given that I'm not the most involved student? What tone should I have when answering the prompts? As a transfer student, what things should I be considering when working on my application?\n\nAny and all input is greatly appreciated, as I want to do everything in my power to get accepted before I click submit on my application!",

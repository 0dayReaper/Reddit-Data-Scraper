    "postText": "Hey guys i\u2019m applying EA to MIT for fall 2023. \n\nFailed AP Calc BC and AP Chem exams. Teachers weren\u2019t great bc this was the first year. \n\nWant to major in computer science. \n\nShould I report these or not?\n\nSAT: 1490 ( waiting on october test scores)\n\nI\u2019m in the IB program and a lot of my teachers said that the IB Analysis and Approaches HL class and exam will make up for the bad AP scores but I don\u2019t take those test until May (actually after I pass the commitment deadline)\n\nWhat should I do?",

            "comment": "If you failed AP Calculus BC, AP Chemistry, you want to rethink whether or not you want to even apply to MIT.\n\nThis was written 16 years ago when admissions were a lot less competitive:\n\n[https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/its\\_more\\_than\\_a\\_job/](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/its_more_than_a_job/)\n\n&gt;First you apply. Your application is read by a senior staff member who will look for deal-breakers (like a bunch of D\u2019s, for example). Assuming you\u2019re competitive, your application is then read by a primary reader who will summarize it at length for the committee. \n\nPretty sure \"multiple fails\" is worse than \"multiple D's.\"",

If you failed the AP courses, then listen to what u/reincarnatedbiscuits said.",

    "postText": "Hello!\n\n\nI am an international student who is interested in studying at MIT. I have taken SAT - 1540(760 English, 780 Mathematics). Should I retake the SAT in December to achieve 800 in Mathematics ( I am usually very good at Math, I don't know why I  missed 2 questions). I am asking because I have heard that if you don't have 800 in Mathematics it really lowers your chances  and I am really busy in November and October preparing for IOAA and IAO, which will be some strong features of my application.\n\nThank you in advance for your answer!",

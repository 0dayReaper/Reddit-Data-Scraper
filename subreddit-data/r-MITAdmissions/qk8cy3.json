    "postText": "I posted this on r/ApplyingtoCollege but thought you guys might be able to help me as well. Sorry for all the questions!\n\nI'm applying to MIT EA. I got a 3 on one of my science AP tests, so I don't want to report it. When I self-reported my courses, I initially said yes to \"Have you taken the corresponding exam offered with this course?\" and was planning on not reporting the score. However, under the test scores section, it says to \"list any exams you have taken.\" Does that mean I have to list my 3 as well or can I choose which ones to report? If I don't list my 3 and I get accepted and MIT sees it on my score report, would I get rescinded? Or can I say I did not take the AP exam under the course, not report it, and cancel it if I get in? Thanks!",

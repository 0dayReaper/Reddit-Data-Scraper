    "postText": "Welp. Overly involved dad here. Actually, maybe I'm overly involved emotionally, not overly involved in reality. I make my kid do pretty much everything on his own -- that's the only way to learn -- but it kills me to watch the process.\n\nI brought my son to MIT when he was only a few years old. I happened to be in town for an athletic competition, but even when he was a toddler I could tell he was a bright kid. So we walked around the buildings and I told him how they made futuristic science stuff. He loved it. He looked at the boring buildings as if he were at an amusement park. Ever since then he's always talked about attending MIT to help improve the world. And I encouraged it. Maybe it wasn't the best parenting move. I'm not sure. As years passed, he ended up with a few setbacks in life, but the whole MIT dream kind of kept him pushing along. By the time he was in high school, he was excelling. He did some amazing research over the past year that I can't even comprehend, and he just finished a 300 level math class at a nearby university. He's done an incredible job. I'm very proud of him.\n\nThis is borderline lunacy, really, but I've felt this strange connection to MIT for a long time. Almost his entire childhood. Now he has finally applied to MIT and he'll find out tomorrow if he get's in or not. It is not likely to happen, even though he is certainly bright/driven enough to thrive there, and so I've been anguishing over the big event for quite some time. Now that it's just a day away, the anxiety is peaking. I can't imagine how *he's* feeling. Not confident, I know that (there were a few setbacks in the application process, like one of his recommenders not submitting a letter, and him not getting an interview -- just bad luck, not his fault). I'm trying to think about what I should say if he gets bad news. In the end, I'm sure he'll be fine either way.\n\nSo if he doesn't get in, then so long, MIT. It was nice knowing you, but I'll be forced to dislike you after that. If he does get in, well then, I guess I'll actually have a reason to feel connected to MIT and won't feel like such a lunatic. I kind of wanted to write this as a mental prep for myself, but also just because maybe it's nice for the MIT people to have a reminder about how things are seen from the \"outside.\" Don't get me wrong, I'm not personally envious, but so many kids dream of attending MIT so they can be at the forefront of the push to make change. It's really an amazing thing that way.\n\n \ud83e\udd1e",

Which is no matter what school they go to they will be successful in life.  Period.  A school doesn\u2019t make or break you.  Sure we all dream of our kids getting into MIT especially since they are passionate about it. We always want the best for them and for their dreams to come true. But when they don\u2019t - we move on. Head up high knowing they gave it their all and God has a different plan for them.  Good luck tomorrow.",

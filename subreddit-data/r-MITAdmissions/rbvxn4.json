The Admissions team told me that they have a shortage of ECs and if I cant be given an interview then it will be waived for me. This happened to 3 other applicants (from my country) who I know. Who else is facing this issue?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: Also, will it negatively affect my chances (despite the waiver) :(",

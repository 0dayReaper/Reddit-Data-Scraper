    "postText": "Hello fellow first year EA Applicants.\n\nI wanted to ask for some advice as we await our decisions because, in my case, the time when they will release is unfortunate.\n\nI know that the decision will be there regardless of when I am able to view it but I still want to know what you would do in my situation.\n\nSo, let's begin.\n\nI will be on a plane from 11 am to 1 pm est on 12/17. Then have a two hour layover and another two hours flight. My question is; Do I dare open the website using the limited in-flight wifi and experience the stages of grief or elation on a plane, wait until Im at the airport and open it then, or wait until I arrive at my destination to fully embrace the decision.\n\nGotta love an additional layer of stress to an already exciting but stressful decision.\n\nSincerely,\nEvilDunk\n\nEDIT: writing this on the plane, my row was excited for me and watched me open it including my sister and parents. I was deferred, but that's better than rejection imo.",

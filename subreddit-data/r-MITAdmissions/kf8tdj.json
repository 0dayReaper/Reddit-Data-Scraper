    "postText": "I have done two research in high school, one on neuroscience and one on astrophysics.\n\nBut the neuroscience one was an independent research, meaning i did everything in the process. \n\nThe astrophysics one was with a professor but i am not authored in the paper (i only worked on it in a lab) \n\nIm wondering which one i should submit. Both of these research are equally very meaningful to me. Is it ok to submit a research paper that im not authored in?",

Having passion and doing your own projects is probably a better leading indicator of your success at a university like that, which is so unstructured. But that's just my impression. The admissions process is a bit opaque.",

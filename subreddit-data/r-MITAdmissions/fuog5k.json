    "postText": "I hope someone going to answer...\n\nI an an Afghan citizen, and here we don't have any of those AP classes. I tried my best for ECs but my best EC is a volunteer work and nothing significant, don't have competitions either and it hurts to read other people's stats because there is no way that I can get in if they applied to MIT. However,  I tried my best in thing that I had : \n\na 4.0 unweighted GPA and no weighted (APs are not offered in my country) \n\ngot a 5 year full scholarship from the best school in my country\n\nscholarship to visit the capital, and won some math competitions. \n\nwon Rubik's competition 2 times my best try was 40 seconds and the next year I started the competition in my school.\n\nstarted 3 clubs in the school: robotics club, sports club, English club\n\ngot a leadership certificate. \n\n 105 TOEFL \n\n1510 SAT\n\n 800 math 2\n\n and 800 physics\n\n I love programming and I couldn't start learning till my senior year because we have a really heavy course load: there are 16 classes offered each year and they are not related to your passion either, you can't choose between them.  (You have to take all of them) What ever you say will play an important role in my journey.\n\nthanks.",

It sounds like you\u2019re in the range of qualified students. Beyond that, there are no guarantees. MIT doesn\u2019t only want extremely book-smart people, or wealthy people, or people who take specific test. So, definitely apply and work hard to represent yourself well in the essay portion (so long as you\u2019re qualified, which you are, it is the most important part).",

    "postText": "So from the EECS graduate website, you need to pursue a PhD in computer science. Can\u2019t pursue just a masters. \n\nBut it also says if you don\u2019t have a masters, then you will get one first. Is it possible to not continue after receiving your masters?\n\nAlso there\u2019s no information on the timeframe. I\u2019m guessing it takes 2 years for the masters and 5 for the PhD, so 7 years in total?\n\nThanks",

            "comment": "I'm not actually in EECS, so I dont know about their department specifics, but the way that most departments work is you enter as a master's student (at least on paper), then have to do quals to become a phd student. Quals usually happens in year two. You can absolutely leave any time you want, and if you've met the requirements for the masters, then you leave with a masters and that's fine.",

                    "comment": "To clarify (PhD candidate here), once you pass your qualifying exams you're generally considered *eligible* to drop out with a master's (often called \"mastering out\"). You'll still have to consult with your thesis committee and submit an acceptable master's thesis in order to do so, and depending on your specific situation that could be basically a formality or actually quite annoying.",

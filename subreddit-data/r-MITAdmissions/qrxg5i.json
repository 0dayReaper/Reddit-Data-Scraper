I decided to attend community college a year ago and have really surprised myself with how well I\u2019ve done and would like to finish out my undergrad studying business and/or Econ. (The goal is to make movies professionally and help create companies/programs/tech/etc that help to finance and support new filmmakers or artists. I think the current Hollywood model is broken and the cracks are showing now more than ever. Innovation in business and tech will become crucial as content becomes more digitally driven imo) \n\nI\u2019m about to finish my 3rd semester of community college and have begun the transfer admissions process. I hadn\u2019t seriously considered MIT till recently. Sloan looks awesome and the overall vibe of the place matches my efforts to pursue innovation as well as scientific approaches to business and the entertainment industry. \n\nI\u2019ve got a 4.0 and have started retaking  the ACT (Just got a 33 and will continue taking through Feb). I\u2019ll have Chem 1 and Physics 1 done by the end of this semester. I\u2019ll for sure have Calc 1 done by the end of spring but I\u2019m currently weighing whether or not to take Bio 1 or Physics 2 or neither (in order to put more time into ACT and college apps)\n\nWhat do y\u2019all think? How important are MIT\u2019s course recommendations on their site? I know they\u2019re required for graduating but I wasn\u2019t sure how important they are for getting in...\n\nAlso, do you guys think I\u2019d be a good fit for MIT? I\u2019m not a science whiz and I\u2019m not pursuing engineering. But I DO love numbers, data, and trying to innovate new solutions to problems, even if those problems are related to something as inconsequential as movies lol... Or should I look towards somewhere like UCLA or USC b/c of the entertainment industry?\n\nAny thoughts or guidance would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "I can't give you too much advice, but just so you know, the application for transfers to mit is even more selective than the regular application. The 25th percentile for ACT is 35. The 75th is 36. That's to say, apply if you want to, but don't count on getting in.\n\n As far as classes go, I doubt that what you choose will have a big effect on whether you get admitted. I also can't speak for how much transfer credit they give for GIRs, so I don't know how beneficial they will be.\n\nAll that being said, judging just from this one comment it seems like you would fit in at MIT, but I also think UCLA or USC are good options for what you want to do as well.",

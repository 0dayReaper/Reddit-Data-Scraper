    "postText": "Just for some context, I'm a dual citizen (Austria and US), born and raised in Vienna. Due to my US heritage, I really like the idea of studying in the US - and MIT would be my dream college!\n\nI recently did some ACT practice tests since I've never done standardized tests before (it's not really a thing here in Europe), and got composite scores in the range of 33-35. I usually don't do as well on the math section, since some of the questions cover areas in math that we weren't really taught in highschool. It seems the curriculum is slightly different in Europe. I'm currently studying the areas where I have knowledge-gaps, but as it stands my average composite score is roughly 34.\n\nIs it possible to me admitted to MIT with a score of 34, or do I need at least a 35 to have a chance?\n\nThanks for any advice guys!",

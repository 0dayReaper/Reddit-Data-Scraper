            "comment": "I think my MIT essays were definitely my best essays, as I put a lot of time (~30 hours) on them. I think the biggest things for the essays was just portraying the human side of yourself, nothing more nothing less: be it humour, maturity, responsibility, quirkiness whatever. The essays are a place for you to just be yourself, that is all the AOs can ask from you and you can do yourself. Its definitely NOT a place to list off all your accomplishments and rewards, as that\u2019s redundant. I do not think my essays were what got me in though, they were one of many components, including my awards, ecs, and teacher recs.",

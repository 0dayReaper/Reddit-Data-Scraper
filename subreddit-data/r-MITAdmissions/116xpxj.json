I am a bit skeptical, I don't mind the workload. Would it be better if I stuck with high school or if I got higher education from TAMS? I am not super sure how MIT admission works but I know they value college prep, so what do I do? do I attend this 2 year college for computer science or not? Would it be better to stick to high school with AP classes and such?",

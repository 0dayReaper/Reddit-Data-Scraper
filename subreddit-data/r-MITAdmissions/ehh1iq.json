    "postText": "In the parent section of the MyMIT application, it asks for the following:\nHighest Level of Education\nName of undergraduate school, if any\nDegree\nYear\nName of graduate or professional school, if any\nDegree\nYear\n\n1. For degree it means what it was in right? So materials science, electrical engineering etc.\n2. My mom got a bachelor's in nursing. For highest level of education, two options are \"4 year college degree\" and \"nursing degree.\" Should I pick nursing degree as that's more specific? My mom's an RN if that matters\n3. My dad went to three different schools for his bachelor's, master's, and doctorate (one each). Should I try to put the master's and doctorate school in the second area?\n\nSorry for the stupid, last minute questions and thanks for any help!!",

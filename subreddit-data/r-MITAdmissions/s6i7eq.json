What is the point of these, and does it mean students taking them have a substantial advantage?\nBtw if some French people that applied have some specific tips feel free to share them lol (I know it\u2019s too late since the applications are already sent but for my personal knowledge)",

They're not looking for any particular type of credentials, only that you made the most of whatever opportunities you had.\n\n\"Honors\" is a very unspecific term that usually just means \"we've separated the top 25% and put them in their own class so they're not slowed down by the dumdums\".\n\nAP is a program where schools can offer college-level classes, and then at the end of the semester students can take a test, and if they pass, then many colleges will give them college credit for it. For example, there's regular Physics, and then there's AP Physics which is the same material but with calculus.",

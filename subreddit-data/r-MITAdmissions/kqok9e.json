            "comment": "Idk, but this is starting to irritate me. I emailed admissions about submitting a portfolio of CS projects, and they replied with a link to the exact page I was already looking at. I ended up submitting without a portfolio because it looked like it was only for visual/musical artists.\n\nMIT should switch to the common application. My common app was far better than my MIT application, simply because I was able to fit all the important stuff in (and a lot of schools allow uploading resumes). There's just no possible way MIT got a good/thorough impression of me from that application. I can't be the only one who feels like this.\n\nThen there's the whole \"interview\" thing. Was anyone interviewed for early action? They always say \"if you don't get an interview, it will be waived with no harm to your application\". That sounds good inprinciple, but in reality it's just not true. Suppose for a second that it is - then what's the purpose of having interviews to begin with? The interview was important for me, I was counting on it to add depth to what I felt like was a really weak and incomplete representation of myself on the MIT app. You can list 4 activities and you get 40 words to describe each of them lol. There's just no way to communicate a true sense of depth and involvement in a whole ESSAY, let alone 40 words. \n\nWoah that got off on a tangent, sorry. I don't mean to be unappreciative of the admissions department... they work hard and they do their best to do a good job. That being said, I can't help but think that they don't quite grasp the gravity of the situation here. They are determining our future.. if they're holding on to the old application for little more reason than \"MIT isn't a common school, so it can't use the common app\", it's time for a change. And the maker portfolio could use some clarification.\n\nI'm sure this comment wasn't of any help.. but anyways good luck in your application! I got deferred EA and I'm still holding out hope for regular admissions. Maybe by some ridiculous serendipity we'll end up in a lecture hall there together.",

    "postText": "Hi! I am a currently high school student interested in applying to MIT this year. I am from Argentina and it would be my dream come true to be able to study there. I am very interested into quantum computing and thought about doing a major in applied physics or computer science. I only found an applied physics major for graduate students and I was wondering if someone could clear out my doubt.",

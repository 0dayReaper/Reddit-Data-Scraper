    "postText": " \n\nHello,\n\nI am a high school student and I want to go to MIT for college, but I want to know kind of things I need to do to get accepted. For students who have been accepted, please tell me what it takes to get in. What was your GPA and SAT score?\n\nI am currently a Sophomore with a 4.0 unweighted GPA, and I rank in the top ten in my class. I already have half my community service hours needed for all of high school and I have also been in Varsity sports and I have been a finalist in multiple science fairs. I am also already in Pre-calc and AP classes.\n\nAny insight on this would be greatly appreciated.",

Don't try to fluff your application with stuff that you think \"looks good.\" Are you interested in something in particular with science? Research it. Contact active scientists and see if they will mentor you. Get experience outside of school.",

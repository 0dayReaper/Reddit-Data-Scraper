I am pretty good at math, but definitely far from being \"one of the best in the world\"\n\nAlthough I'm only in the first year of HS so I guess I still have a chance, but I feel like that's not enough time to get good enough for an international",

I'm not nearly good enough at math to participate in IMO. And I also have very little previous competitive programming experience, so I doubt I could get into IOI either, especially since my country is one of the top IOI countries so it's incredibly competitive here.\n\nI am also interested in chemistry, and IChE is less competitive than IMO/IOI, but I'm still probably not even close to being an intl olympiad level student",

The issue is that, as I said, I'm an international student, and from what I've heard it's a lot harder to get into MIT as an international and very hard without intl olympiads",

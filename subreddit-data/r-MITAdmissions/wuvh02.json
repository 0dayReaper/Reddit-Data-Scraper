    "postText": "I was rejected :( from MIT WISE on Friday but they said the following\u2026.\n\n\u201cThank you for your interest in WISE. We're sorry to share that we are not able to invite you to campus for the program. However, we were impressed with your WISE application and encourage you to consider applying for admission to the Class of 2027.\nIf you decide to apply, we'll waive your\napplication fee-simply select \"yes\" in the Fee Waiver Request section of the application.\u201d\n\nAlthough I know this doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll be admitted since MIT is very selective, but does it mean that they\u2019ve taken an interest in my academic profile and might give me a slight edge during the admissions cycle?",

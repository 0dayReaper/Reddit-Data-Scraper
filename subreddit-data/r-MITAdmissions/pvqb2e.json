I've won a bronze at IMO, and all albanian students who have applied to MIT and were accepted are either winners of Honourable mentions at IMO, or have simply participated at IMO. Their sat scores weren't extraordinary, in contrary they scored somewhere between 1400-1500. They have earned different certificates from volunteer organisations in my country (from which I haven't got any yet) and another advice they told me was to be as honest as possible in the essays. Basically whether you will be accepted to MIT is something that can't be predicted in any way and I don't know exactly what to give more importance to. The main requirement of MIT is \"being a good person\", so the application process is a bit confusing.",

In my case is similar I haven\u2019t gone to any IMO, but I have participated in the IOI (no medals or anything), and I have competed nationally in math Olympiads and know people from math Olympiads from my country who are attending MIT rn, one of them got bronze in the IMO, other two got HM, and there is also another one who just got some medals nationally.\n\nThe bronze medal winner told me exactly the same thing about the SAT, what she was most clear about is that the important score is the math one, if you get 700+ (preferably 750+) you should be good, even if your reading and writing score is lower (600-700) it is ok because to a certain extent your TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo score would also kinda be part of knowing if your English is good or not (also mit is more sciences focus so the English section is not that important)\n\nAbout the essays I have nothing to say more that what you said.\n\nI\u2019ll be applying this year too, gl to all of you and I hope we all end up being part of MIT\u2019s class of 2026",

It is kinda known that MIT likes ppl from olympiads and mostly for intl students it is helpful to have to achievements since it is a good way for them to know you have certain abilities that olympiads give you like that you care and that you put a lot of dedication into things you like.\n\nSo yeah you have  a lot of chances (ofc, this is from what I think and know )",

If you go to the admissions webpage you can see what they score they require you to have and what thry recommend you to have. \n\nFor the Toefl they say they require 90 but they recommend 100+. When it comes to the Duolingo English Test, they require 120 but they recommend 125+. I got 135 on the Duolingo and 630 on the SAT Eng and I think I\u2019m perfectly fine. Although I haven\u2019t received my decision yet, I think that having a score above or the same of what they recommend  is a good way of telling them that your English is not bad(or better than your SAT score).",

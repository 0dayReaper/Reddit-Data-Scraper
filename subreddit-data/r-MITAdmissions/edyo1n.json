    "postText": "I know this isnt about a typical application, but hear me out.  I just finished my first semester at UMD, after getting rejected from MIT when I applied during fall applications last year; however, up until the day that I got my decision, my.mit never showed my second recommendation letter as recieved or processed.\n\n I know this is probably pointless, but I'm considering applying to transfer for next fall so that I can at least get accepted or rejected based on my academic capabilities rather than my misunderstanding of what counted as a humanities recommendation or a teacher being late with a recommendation letter.\n\n Is this definitely a pointless idea, and is there anything I should know or do if I do end up doing this?",

It\u2019s going to cost you &lt; $100 and a few days of your time.\n\nHowever, make sure to keep a good mindset through the application process. Do NOT allow yourself fall out of love with UMD. If you get accepted into MIT, it\u2019ll be great! If you don\u2019t, it\u2019ll be okay.",

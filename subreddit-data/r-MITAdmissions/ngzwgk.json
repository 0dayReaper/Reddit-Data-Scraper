    "postText": "Hi! My name is Josefina, I am a senior at high school in Argentina. I am hoping to apply to MIT early action this year. As I am an international student, chances of getting in are really not high. Since I saw many international students who were admitted usually participated in Olympiads and won some kind of international recognition, I wanted to know if that is needed in order to get in. Of course I know there is many more things MIT considerate, but, do I really have a chance to get in as an international student if I didn't won any international Olympiad recognition?",

It will be more difficult to differentiare yourself from the rest of the international applicants unless you have a really good hook. That being said, it is always worth a shot!",

I participated in the Ghana National Olympiad and qualified to the last 12 out of thousands of students in successive tests but placed 6th in the top five to be chosen to have an international shot. Can we be friends?\n\nLooks like we've got the same story here.",

I have never got to National Olympiads, I am maybe hoping to this year but I really don't have much expectations. But of course I would love to talk and share experiences since we are in the same process.",

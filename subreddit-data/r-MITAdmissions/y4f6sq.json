            "comment": "Explain two things:\n\n1. Why you are interested in the field of study that you chose, why you want to major in it\n\n2. Why at MIT and not another university\n\nAdvice that I\u2019ve gotten from MIT admits and counselors: don\u2019t put down rankings. MIT knows that it\u2019s the best in the best, that\u2019s why they\u2019re extremely selective, no need to put down \u201cbecause MIT is #1 in Computer Science\u201d or \u201cMIT is the best in the best in [insert field]\u201d. If it\u2019s a STEM field, MIT is more likely than not #1 in it in the USA and the world, don\u2019t repeat the obvious. Instead, state why MIT and not another school. What about it? Its facilities? Its location? The people there? The research opportunities? The openness and diversity in the school? The abundance of prestigious and world-renowned scientists that are there to help students? Stuff like that I\u2019m pretty sure",

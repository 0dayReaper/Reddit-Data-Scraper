    "postText": "How likely am I to go far if I don\u2019t have many awards to show for my extracurriculars?\n\nThis is one of my dream schools and I am super interested in physics/robotics. I currently lead a research team and have cofounded a battlebots club at my school. I don\u2019t know if this is enough, however. I participate in vex robotics, taekwondo, and have played violin for 7 years, but I don\u2019t have significant awards to back up these interests. Im in my junior year currently and don\u2019t have much time. What should I do?",

You might be able to get a service award.\n\nIf you have a project that really excites you, you might be able to submit it to some contests.\n\nTalent is important but it doesn\u2019t have to be big award winning displays of talent. I think the keys are passion, leadership, commitment to community\u2026what you do isn\u2019t as important as the motivation for why you are doing it. Are you someone who is driven to solve global challenges? Do you want to help people? What makes you tick and how have you pursued that? It sounds like you are well on your way to a good answer to these questions.",

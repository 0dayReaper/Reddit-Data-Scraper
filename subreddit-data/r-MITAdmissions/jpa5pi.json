Some have responded immediately, some have the crush of job or family responsibilities get in the way of responding.  The report deadline is November 21, so you do have a little time left.  Contact the admissions office if you haven't heard and there's only a week or so left.\n\nThis year has been exceptionally heavy in volume, perhaps because a lot of applicants who would otherwise not have the time until Christmas vacation are getting them done early just to have something to do.  There may be a lot of people who we just don't have the capacity to interview in the EA round, and there is a large number of unassigned applicant in Overflow waiting to be claimed.  For what it's worth, the majority of EA applicants do get deferred into the RA round, where they're reconsidered from the beginning.\n\nMIT policy is not to hold it against an applicant who couldn't be offered an interview for reasons beyond their control.\n\nAlso, check your Spam folder.",

All of the interviewers are people with work, etc. so they will email you just in due time. Also just make sure you check your email for unknown people. The email is from the interviewer themselves, not MIT",

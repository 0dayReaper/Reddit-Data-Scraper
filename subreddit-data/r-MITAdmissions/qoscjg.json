    "postText": "Hi Guys,\n\nHope you are all doing well.\n\nWell this is the first time for me reaching out to you guys on this platform. I am pretty sure for all of you, MIT interviews are just a free flowing conversations and for each of us our interview experience will be very different off course. But nevertheless, sharing our experiences can definitely give more insights to other students. I know it is a lot to ask for, but is anyone willing to share some questions that they encountered during the interview; especially those \"weird\" questions that appear out of nowhere. I purely asking to have some glimpse about what I might be asked. And actually this can be a very useful resource for all of us.\n\nI will really appreciate if I could receive a genuine response. Thank you.",

If you do a quick Google search you'll find what I mean by typical. I doubt that it has changed much in the past few years, although maybe post covid interviews are different.\n\nAs far as specific questions, I just remember being asked \"Why MIT\" which I think is a pretty standard question that you can expect to be asked. Along this same line of questioning, my anticipated major was also brought up, why I wanted to have that major, why I wanted to have that major at MIT specifically and what experience I had with that field.\n\n I also remember just generally discussing my high school life (both academics and extracurriculars), the question was something like something like \"How did you get to this point?\" \n\nMy best advice is to 1.) look up general college admissions questions and have answers to them, 2.) Review your answers to the application essays, they might ask questions similar to these and give you a chance to elaborate, and 3.) Really think about what (specific) aspects of MIT attract you.\n\nIf you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Good luck!",

Personally, I was planning on being a computer science major, and I talked about how I liked that MIT has a focus on gaining practical knowledge and real experience hence the motto \"mens et manus\" (mind and hand). I don't think there's really a wrong answer, but I would try to think of something that doesn't apply to tons of other schools. So I wouldn't say, \"I want to go to MIT because it is very prestigious\" or \"I want to be a computer science major and MIT has a good computer science program\" because those are generalizations that are true of many schools.",

            "comment": "I finished my interview yesterday. This is how it went.\n\nInterviewer = him\nMe = me\n\nIt started with him asking me for a little information about myself. I responded by telling him where I was born and that I Immigrated to the US and have been living here since I was 2. I then went on to talk about an NPO I created to help students with social interaction during the pandemic and online school.\n\nThe conversation sort of fell down this rabbit hole for a while. We discussed more about the origin of the organization, what I do in it, how many people it\u2019s impacted, e.t.c. Then virtual reality made its way into the conversation and we had a bit of fun talking about that and how it\u2019ll help people be more social by allowing them to talk to people face to face from the comfort of their rooms, and how it\u2019ll made education easier for people unable to go to a physical school to get it.\n\nThen he asked what new developments I have in mind for VR, so I brought up the fact that I read tons of MIT research from McGovern Institute for Brain Research (couldn\u2019t remember the name during the interview, so RIP) and connected it to how I thought connecting VR to the brain will be the next big step for the field of technology because it\u2019ll allow people to see virtual reality as a literal new reality\u2014one with negligible difference from real life.\n\nAlso we talked about AI and my spontaneous thoughts on the technological singularity.\n\nThen he pulled it back by asking if I had any questions for him about MIT.\n\nHe was a mechanical engineering PhD, so I asked him how he navigated the engineering resources about MIT. The discussion then diverged into the notion that MIT is a interdisciplinary institution meaning that, although he was a mech engineer PhD, his thesis was on algorithms (a primarily CS topic). We talked about how incredible that was and how the possibilities and opportunities at MIT truly are endless.\n\nThen I asked him about culture and tradition at the MIT campus. I brought up \u201chacker\u201d culture, and he told me the police car story (a police car placed atop the great dome in the middle of the night). He walked by the dome at 3 am. No police car. He walked by again at 7 am and suddenly there was a police car just chilling up there somehow.\n\nWe had a back and forth of a few more questions about MIT and other discussion topics\u2026\n\nWe talked about climate change, competitive programming, how I first got into programming, and how I first learned about MIT and became interested in the school.\n\nAnd the interview sort of just ended after that. We ran out of conversation about 50 minutes in.\n\nThis was, as I understand it, a very very very atypical interview. This interview is the result of putting 2 tech nerds in a zoom call together to talk about MIT. I don\u2019t know how this interview went honestly. It could\u2019ve gone amazing, or terrible depending on how much my AOs appreciate the fact that we talked about MIT for only about a third of the interview LMAO.",

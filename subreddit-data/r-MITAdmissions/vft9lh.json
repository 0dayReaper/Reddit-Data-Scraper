    "postText": "I'm currently in grade eleven, and was able to get a 98.8% as my overall mark this year. I'm not from the US and English is not my first language but I should be able to get an 8 or 8.5 in my IELTS. I don't have an A levels degree but I'm currently doing a level 3 BTEC course in mechatronics, which is a 720 hour course, and I should be able to get D (Distinction) in all subjects.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, would a 98-99% score in my grade 12 certificate + 8-8.5 IELTS + Distinction in all subjects of my BTEC course, be good enough in comparison to what might be expected from admissions, and would I have to do SATs?\n\nIn terms of extracurriculars, I am able to somewhat program using C# and I teach every now and then.\n\nI'm thinking about majoring in EECS or AreoAstro.\n\nAny help in this matter would be extremely appreciated!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5r04z0y9dk691.png?width=2541&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8731c5d0168eb1826198ebb631f8002a44e1b24e",

But the reality is that MIT only accepts 1.3% of international applicants; there are just way too many qualified applicants.\n\nAs for how to prepare, read this:\n\nhttps://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying_sideways/",

We wish you best of luck, but honestly we don't have any insight into the calculation that goes into the admissions procedure because everything about college admissions is opaque on purpose.  All we have are just the overall admissions numbers, and that is basically as good as an estimate you are gonna get.",

And Canadian schools are pretty closely aligned to American schools (the vast majority are Anglophone, everyone has a second language if not more, there are extracurriculars available, etc.)",

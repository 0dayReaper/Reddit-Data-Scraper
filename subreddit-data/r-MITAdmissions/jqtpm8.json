    "postText": "As the title suggest, I\u2019m in quite a predicament. \n\nSo before I get into it, I just wanna say no, I don\u2019t come from a line or lineage of extremely rich and wealthy parents, I\u2019m not the top of my classes, I\u2019m not in all AP courses, and I didn\u2019t cure a terminal disease (sadly). I\u2019m just... average. \n\nI\u2019m a 17yr old sophomore in High School in two honors courses, one AP course (being AP Psych), I play a sport, and one of the honors courses I am in is band. Everything else is grade level. \n\nExcept for math. \n\nDespite the idea of wanting to major in Computer Science, I\u2019m in Algebra 1 CP. it\u2019s not that I\u2019m bad at math, I can easily understand and grasp it. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t study. Which... usually leads to my defeat. And if you wanna major in CS, you gotta know math. \n\nLike every cliche applicant, MIT is my dream college, and honestly, I REALLY don\u2019t want to settle for less. \n\nCurrently it\u2019s the first marking period and it seems like I\u2019m failing math and one if not two other classes. Thankfully, I have 3 other marking periods to go and shine my ass off, so I can grind for the next following months so I can get straight A\u2019s (hopefully). \n\nBut because of this, I\u2019m wondering is it too late for me to get into MIT? If not, what should I do? Clubs? A different sport (The sport I play is lacrosse)? I\u2019m at a lost here and could use advice. \n\nThanks. \n\nPS my freshman year wasn\u2019t that great. But got off with a 3.75-4.00gpa",

            "comment": "I think you should supplement your math experiences. MIT is a school intended for people who want to major in the Sciences which is all based on MATH. If you are interested in majoring in Comp Sci, you should take Comp Sci classes or coding classes from Khan Academy, CodeHS, or just teach yourself. You should try to prove to the admissions offices that you are interested in Comp Sci and you already have pursued it without the help of MIT.",

    "postText": "I took some dual enrollment classes through UCONN. However, these classes were taught at my high school, not at UCONN. On the MIT app, it says, \"List the secondary schools (high schools) you have attended.\" But, I also read that they use the schools on that list to attach received transcripts (and of course, UCONN isn't a high school). Do I add that to the \"Schools Attended\" section, or do I just submit my official college transcript? Sorry if this is a confusing question, and thanks in advance for your help!",

High schools in my district have college classes taught in the high schools, but they're called something else.\nDual enrollment in my district is only where you're fully registered at the college, taking the class at the college.\nSorry, not that helpful, but I think there might be another term listed on the common app?",

Even though the classes are taught at my high school, I still get UCONN credit and separate grade. And, the teachers who teach this class are UCONN-certified instructors (basically UConn professors).",

I got deferred though, so that might not have been the way to go... Try emailing the admissions office? They might be able to get back to you in time if you do it ASAP.\n\n(pinging u/peteymit just in case, i know he doesn't always get to these but it's worth a shot)",

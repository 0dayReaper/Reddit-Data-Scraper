What you have done is prepared yourself for success in college no matter where you end up. If MIT is the dream, and you get rejected, here is a stat for you: &gt;60% of MIT students are grad students\u2026 apply yourself wherever you go and maybe apply again in 4 yrs?",

And right now my best friend came from a \"no-name college\" but we have the same job title because we both busted our butt in work and talked to every person we could and got a sick job.\n\nSo, whether you come to MIT or not: just network, work hard, and party, in that order.",

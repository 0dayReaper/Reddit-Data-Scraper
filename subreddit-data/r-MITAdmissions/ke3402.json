    "postText": "Hey y'all, after my first semester at my current college, I really am not enjoying the vibe, the opportunity, the teaching, and other things that really make me want to transfer. I know getting in as a freshman is tough, let alone transferring. None the less, I still want to give it a shot. Anything I should expect, what my college GPA and activities should look like? What would hurt my application.\n\nAlso I'm interested in getting a shot to play for the D3 tennis team, given I get in, anything on that?",

            "comment": "You need to demonstrate your competency in high school sciences but you don\u2019t need to be neck deep in science extra curriculars. MIT knows people change their goals throughout high school so not everyone committed to science ECs, and others may not have had the opportunity to do so. I for one did debate in high school. \n\nHowever, be aware of the MIT\u2019s science GIR requirement. You\u2019ll be doing a years worth of classes that are abstract science and maths, so if you\u2019re hoping for a humanities degree MIT may not be for you. Unless you want to combine arts and sciences, in which case MIT is definitely for you.",

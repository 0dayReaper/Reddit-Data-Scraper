            "comment": "Bryan Sacks is super great! I\u2019ve had him 3 times. You can get an easy A doing minimal effort. There\u2019s weekly readings you can skim and ask like one question about. Depending on the format you\u2019ll usually have one final paper or presentation. Maybe a exam with essay questions. Less than an hour a week worth of work and then maybe 5-10 hours for the final. I would encourage you to try and sink your teeth in a bit more though as the class discussions he leads are always great and it\u2019s a really interesting subject imo.",

The one\n'exam' he's given was a choice between a few essay questions during class time.\nThey very slightly but mostly it's 1 shorter paper/ discussion board around midterms. A proposal for your final project due week 7. Then the final paper itself. I wouldn't stress about the work at all, it's about the least work load of any class l've taken combined with a super chill prof. If you show interest and effort you can't fail.",

I am taking him hybrid, so class is at a specified time every week, but I am assuming it's online since it says hybrid. Does he check attendance, and do you think it's fine if I just don't attend class and do the work instead? I don't mind attending or anything but I'm just curious what my options are. Also, I'm not too worried about this class but I did see a couple reviews on docsity claiming that he grades harsh for writings and for the midterm so I'm just a bit confused about that.",

Discussion boards take the place of the other class so you\u2019ll have one a week. I don\u2019t think attendance is technically on his syllabus but I think it\u2019d be valuable to stay in his good graces. I\u2019ve been missing like 3 discussion boards at the end of some terms and he\u2019s always given me As because I show up and put in effort to the class discussions. \n\nIf you\u2019re not used to reading or writing about Philosphy I could see him being a tough grader as he has a very good sense for if you\u2019re completely BSing or if you have genuinely engaged with the material. Just communicate any issues honestly and it\u2019s an easy A.",

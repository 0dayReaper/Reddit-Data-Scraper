You would be getting pretty much a private apartment in a shared house with a shared kitchen and laundry space - your space would include a kitchenette (sink, cabinets, and a refrigerator), a private bathroom, and essentially two separate private rooms for yourself. You'll have 3 housemates in total and we're all super friendly and easygoing! It would not come pre-furnished but we would all be very willing to help you find cheap furnishings off of Amazon or Facebook Marketplace. Please let me know if you want any more info!",

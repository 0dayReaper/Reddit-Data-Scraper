    "postText": "(There are only approximately 3 hours left until the deadline, so quick responses appreciated)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs applying to 18 jobs for round A likely to be enough? I don't want to apply for jobs I don't love at this point; I'd save less appealing jobs for B and possibly C round. \n\nI have a 3.79 GPA and a solid resume, so I assume I'd be a quality candidate for most positions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts appreciated!",

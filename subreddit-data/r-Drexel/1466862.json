    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am in DS major and CS minor, I already take CS260, CS265, CS270, CS380, CS387...\n\nCurrently, I am struggling to fulfill my credit for the coming summer. Since I am an international student and have already taken part-time this quarter, I can not do it this summer again. I still need 3 more credits to satisfy the full-time student requirement.\n\nCould you share some recommendations for CS/SE/DS class? I am looking for some classes that is not super hard but still can allow me to learn something meaningful.\n\nThanks!",

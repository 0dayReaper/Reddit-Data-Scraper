            "comment": "I'm a CS PhD student. The short answer is no not directly because we don't do rotations, you get paired with a CS professor when you're accepted. The long answer is that they threw that out the window last year, accepted some people without advisor pairings, and they now are finding advisors outside the department. But, they're not planning to do that again since it didn't go very well. It isn't strictly speaking not allowed, but it's also not something that's normally done. You should probably contact your POI(s) and maybe the admissions point person for the CS department (not really sure who that is). Part of the thing is, the way IS students and CS PhD students do research can be different. A lot of IS students do studies while we really just write code. Might complicate dissertation planning although definitely not a show stopper. It's also permitted although not the norm to work with 2 faculty members, might be another option.",

But, if the research being done by IS faculty interests you much more than CS, you're probably better off applying to the IS PhD program. However, you should still reach out to CS admissions to see what their thoughts on your goals are.",

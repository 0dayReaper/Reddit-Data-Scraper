    "postText": "I'm a current freshman and part of the STAR Scholars program. I see a lot of people who say to enjoy the first summer as it is the only long break we have at Drexel. The STAR schedule seems really intensive and doesn't seem to allow for any longer breaks without making up all the hours.\n\nPast scholars: do you regret not taking the summer off or do you feel that the research experience helped you significantly? I think I'm getting cold feet since I feel overwhelmed from freshman year and and I can't really quantify how beneficial STAR would be for me. Any comments on how the experience was for you would be helpful.",

            "comment": "for me the research experience was insanely helpful. i already knew i wanted to pursue research as a career, so that's partially why i found it so useful. i can see it being less helpful if your end goal isnt in research. but i was able to use my poster from star to present in an international conference and i leveraged my experience from star to get an intermediate/advanced level coop for my first coop. also, if you want to go into research, this is one of very few opportunities to do that while getting paid (unless you're lucky enough to be in a super lucrative field) as an undergraduate student. overall, no regrets at all, especially since if i hadnt gone i wouldve just stayed at home doing literally nothing or working a job that would be less helpful professionally",

I think it is a really great opportunity especially if you are looking for something to do this summer and are really excited about research! \n\nHowever since the pandemic and moving to college over two hours from home, I have really valued time with my loved ones and it was the right decision for me to go home for summer. I found a fun volunteering job to keep me busy and otherwise just went with the flow and took summer as it came. I also was doing B round for fall/winter co-op for a large chunk of summer which was much more manageable since I didn\u2019t have a lot on my plate. \n\nI know my perspective wasn\u2019t the one you asked for but I love sharing my experiences on the internet lol",

I had a great experience and it gave me a lot of lab experience that helped me land my first co-op and a few research positions down the line. Now I\u2019m currently in the BS/MS program doing my thesis as I personally like research and the amount of doors STAR opened up. Personally I choose STAR vs a summer break as I knew I would be working at home bored out of my mind. But summer time in philly is nice along with the night life! I made a lot of friends and connections during my STAR program",

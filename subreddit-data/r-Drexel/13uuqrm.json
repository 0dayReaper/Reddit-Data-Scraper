    "postText": "Hi all. I'm an incoming freshman and would like to know how to add the business analytics co-major in addition to my primary major of Finance. I emailed Drexel and they gave me a very vague response and told me to talk with my academic advisor even though I haven't been assigned one. I would really appreciate it if someone who has already gone through this process can let me know how they did it. Thanks.",

There\u2019s no rush because your schedule your first term is pretty much made for you so not having added your co-major yet won\u2019t affect it. I didn\u2019t add business analytics until halfway through my sophomore year.",

I think you have 14 free elective credits but I\u2019m not sure. Since those basically go away you\u2019re really only adding 10 credits. Also there might be credit overlap. For me two of the BSAN electives overlapped with two MKTG electives so when you really think about it I really only added 2 credits. Idk if there\u2019s any overlap with finance but you can go into degree works and do a what if where you can see what the requirements would be. Not sure if you have access to that yet.",

    "postText": "Hi. I am an incoming freshman to Drexel as a biomedical engineering major. I will be taking a gap year so housing isn't so much of a priority but still want to get some details. I would likely be living in Vanr because of the kosher dorms but would want to get anyone's feedback of the dorms that are available. If you want to dm feel free or shoot me a message on Snap.

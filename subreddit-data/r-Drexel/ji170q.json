    "postText": "Hey guys, I made a Python program called \"Drexel Course Availability Notifier\". You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/Zohair-coder/Drexel-Course-Availability-Notifier).  It basically lets you select any course and scrapes the Drexel Term Master Schedule to check if a seat for it is available. If it is, it'll send you an email. If not, it'll check again every 10 seconds and email you whenever it's available. Thought it might relieve some stress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the developers, feel free to submit pull requests to improve the code. Cheers.",

People in fine arts majors (graphic design, film, fashion design) are the ones that typically have problems finding good paying co-ops, which is why most of those programs only have one co-op.",

The lowest salary was $20/hr and the highest I've been offered is $35/hr and several companies are known to offer that amount (Vanguard for example). The median is about $24-26 which lines up well with what the drexel website says.",

If not, you will have a tougher time, regardless of what your major is.\n\nAlso, learn how to interview. You still gotta get the person interviewing you to like you enough to offer you a job.",

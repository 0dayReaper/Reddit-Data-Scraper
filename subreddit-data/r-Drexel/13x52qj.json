    "postText": "I did my research on Drexel, and I found that it is good for autism support. I\u2019m just wondering, why is this college better than others in supporting kids with autism ? What accommodations does it give that other colleges don\u2019t give, how does it support and meet the needs of kids with autism, and how does it create an inclusive environment for disabled people people ?",

I also think these questions might be answered in their FAQs. Other than that you\u2019ll most likely get personal experiences on Reddit which can be helpful but don\u2019t give you the full picture of what they\u2019re capable of since everyone has different needs. Best of luck to you!",

Some things that they are doing include a new housing program, peer mentors, and many events (which usually have cookies or snacks). Also, they have some readings that are helpful with transitioning to college/independence. They have staff that can help you find a job, keep up with assignments, and talk to about life in general.   \n\n\nMore from Drexel's website:\n\n[https://drexel.edu/counselingandhealth/autism-neurodiversity/overview/](https://drexel.edu/counselingandhealth/autism-neurodiversity/overview/)",

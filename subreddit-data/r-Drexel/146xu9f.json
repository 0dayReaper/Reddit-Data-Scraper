    "postText": "Studio apartment near Upenn and Drexel, University city/Clark Park 945$/month\n\nSo I signed a lease for another apartment (in another part of the city due to work) and am currently trying to move out of my current apartment. Move in date is July 1. \n\nThe apartment will be empty when you get it. The furniture in the images is only for the advertisement images.\n\nThe apartment is a studio space on the basement floor of the building. It\u2019s at Chester Ave close to Clark Park, which is an approximately 25 min walk to Upenn and Drexel campuses, and has the trolly literally right outside which will take you to both campuses and center city in 10-15 mins. The rent is 945$.\n\nThe area is safe and is a beautiful neighborhood with a park 1 block away. There is a really good mini market, that sells everything you\u2019ll need to cook, nearby.\n\nThe studio space is roomy but is on the lower floor of the building and it looks out at the alley. The apartment has a nice modern kitchen with new utilities, a ceiling fan, and heating. Water is included with rent but electricity isn\u2019t. The bathroom is also roomy with a tub and shower. Both cats and dogs are allowed with an extra fee. The building also has a brand-new fitness center. Laundry and Gym in the building. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested or would like to see the apartment please message me, I will reply instantly.",

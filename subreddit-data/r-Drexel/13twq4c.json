    "postText": "Long story short I\u2019m going to hospitalize myself to work on my mental health that has been awful this quarter, and my grade\u2019s certainly reflect that. What is Drexel likely to do about my classes and status as a student? First two quarters 2.6+ gpa, and on track right now I\u2019d probably finish this quarter with less then 1.0.\n\nI have an extensive history with ongoing treatment and medication, so this would certainly not be an out of the ballpark thing for me I think from the University\u2019s standpoint but idk.",

            "comment": "Please talk to your academic advisor ASAP. If you are finishing with a 1.0 this term, you can always retake classes you have failed up to two times. This would fix your GPA, but the former grade will still remain on your transcript. \n\n**Course Repeat Policy**\n\n&gt;When an undergraduate student repeats a course, only the earned highest grade will be factored into the term and cumulative grade point averages. A student can repeat a course with an earned grade of C- or lower up to two additional times. Upon successful completion of the course, the lower letter grade(s) will no longer be factored into term and cumulative GPA calculations.\n\n\r\n\nAdditionally, even though a 1.0 GPA is below good academic standing with the university, you probably will not get kicked out and will only be placed on academic probation until you can bring your GPA for that term back up to a 2.00. I don't think Academic Probation will be a problem for you, as you can clearly state you were hospitalized and show your academic advisor this will not happen again.\n\n**Academic Probation**\n\n&gt;An undergraduate student is placed on Probation if either the term or cumulative GPA falls below the established minimum 2.00 grade point average standard. Students who are placed on Probation are required to meet with their academic advisor and complete an Academic Agreement by end-of-day Friday of the first week of the subsequent term. Students are formally notified of Probation by email from the Office of the University Registrar. \r  \n\r\n\nResources:\n\n[Repeated Courses and GPA Adjustments: Undergraduate Students](https://drexel.edu/provost/policies-calendars/policies/course_repeat_policy/)\n\n[Academic Standing: Undergraduate Students](https://drexel.edu/provost/policies-calendars/policies/academic_standing/)\n\n**tldr;** I am just a student, but if you talk to your Academic Advisor, I'm pretty sure you will be fine. Yeah, some Fs on your transcript might suck, but I promise it's not the end of the world.",

            "comment": "If you speak with your advisor and take a Leave of Absence ASAP, you can potentially have all your classes complete with an INC grade. Then when you are ready to come back to classes (max is 4 quarters off, but 3 quarters off is ideal because then you don\u2019t have to reapply to the college) you will somehow complete the class, whether it be a project, assignment, examination with the help of your professors.\n\nFor the future, always keep the last day to withdraw on your calendar. If your mental health is bad with you grades suffering, you can easily just Withdraw from your courses, take a leave for a quarter, come back and try again with no real academic repercussions.",

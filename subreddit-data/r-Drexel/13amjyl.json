I live with my 2 friends is ucross and I can never do anything with them cuz they sleep literally all day. My summer is gonna be extremely boring and I don\u2019t want that to happen. So I need new friends. Where on campus are there usually a lot of people? And are there any cool events happening soon that I can go to?",

I suggest you look into clubs or ensembles, since they may share your interest. People tend to be more open in those settings than in class settings. I graduated back in March 2022, and am now in graduate school, and am still friends with people I met in my freshman year at Drexel back in 2018. Good luck!",

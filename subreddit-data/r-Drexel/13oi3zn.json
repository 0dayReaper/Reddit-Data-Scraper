    "postText": "I am an admitted student and trying to clarify few things before confirming my enrollment.\n\nWhat's the average class size in MS CS program at Drexel? Do students face difficulties in getting enrolled into desired classes, in that they are already full before one can enroll?\n\nI have heard some negative reviews of Drexel having bad infrastructure. \n\nMy sole motivation to confirm Drexel over other slightly higher ranked University (GW) is it's Co-Op program. Can someone throw some light on this based on personal experiences? Is it worth it?",

Then scroll to the 500+ classes and look a their sizes. Usually the certificate/intro classes have the most students, but the higher level stuff is smaller class sizes.\n\nI can't speak to the graduate coop program much, but if you have other questions, feel free.",

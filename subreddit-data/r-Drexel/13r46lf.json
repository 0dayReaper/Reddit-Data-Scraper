My girlfriend and I are planning on moving in September and are looking for advice on places to live outside of the city. Any recommendations or advice would be greatly appreciated!",

I used to do that during my freshman year but now I drive to campus everyday, gives me more flexibility. If you are going to drive, Id recommend getting a drexel parking pass. Its expensive but finding parking is a hassle and the PPA is ruthless and will 100% give you a ticket if your meter runs over. \n\nI know fall frosh year your schedule isnt 100% up to you, but once you can build your own schedule you can try stacking your classes so you dont have to commute as often. Asynch/online classes are also great.  \n\nTheres often a disposition that its harder to make friends as a commuter. I dont think thats true. Sure on campus u might have a roommate but dont expect to make friends with your classmates right off the bat. Join some clubs. Through joining student orgs I made the closest friends I have at drexel.",

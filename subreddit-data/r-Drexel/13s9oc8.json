    "postText": "Hi, I'm an incoming freshman at Drexel. After aid, my COA is still tremendously high; I've explored many options to decrease my COA: aid appeal, external scholarships, moving out after the first year to avoid housing and dining, etc. What other options do I have?\n\nCan I graduate in fewer terms, hence avoid tuition fees for those terms? I saw a post on Reddit saying that someone was planning on graduating in 10 terms instead of 12. What would that look like?\n\nAlso, can someone advise me on how I can do two co-ops, instead of 3? I'm an International student so I can only do two full-time coops in the US. This would subsequently allow me to save on housing and dining for the coop duration.",

You can do 2 co-ops and then tell your advisor to switch to 4 years if you want but you\u2019ll still pay the same. The only difference is timing. International students do 2 co-ops here and then usually do 1 international to abide by the rules.",

A co-op allows 6 credits possible but you can only really do 4. Taking a higher course load during regular quarters doesn\u2019t increase tuition if you\u2019re abiding by the 20 credit limit. If you look at your plan of study, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s tailored to a type of student that does 15 credits each term. So, you can get ahead by doing way more each term. To save on tuition and food, have you looked into incorporating something like STARS Scholars? It\u2019s where you do research during the summer and you get room and board for free while getting a stipend. I bet you could even study during this time even though freshman\u2019s go away during summer. This means that you spend the same but you\u2019re just taking a quarter sooner than most.",

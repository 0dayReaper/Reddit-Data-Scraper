The lease runs from 9/23/2023 to 9/8/2024. Let me know/message me if you\u2019re interested!",

Could you use the co-op loophole and show them a hire letter &gt;ten miles away for the last six months of your lease? Ik you wouldn\u2019t technically be on co-op, but I\u2019ve known people who use it to cancel their lease halfway through",

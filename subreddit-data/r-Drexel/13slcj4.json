Once granted an interview, students are required to schedule interviews with the employer in a timely fashion. Students are not allowed to miss classes or finals for co-op interviews. Students should schedule interviews accordingly.\n\nFull Policy: https://drexel.edu/scdc/co-op/policies/scdconline-participation/",

Too soon to do anything until you are an actual student, and typically 1st Year students would not do this....better in years 3 or 4.",

As\n\nFTFY.\n\nAlthough *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:\n\n * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*\n\n * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.\n\n*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*",

    "postText": "Hi guys, \n\nI created a survey to find out more about the on-campus jobs available to students at Drexel. I would like for us international students, especially the incoming freshmen, to get a clearer picture of how they can find these jobs/what they are likely to get paid. I am asking specifically about on-campus jobs, NOT work study. Please fill it, it will only take a minute. Thank you :)",

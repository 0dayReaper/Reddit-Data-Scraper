    "postText": "Hi all. Had a few questions as a Intl Incoming freshman. I\u2019m a finance major with a co major in business analytics.\n\n1) I\u2019m a Intl, so I can only do 2 full time coops in the US. Would it be better to do the first abroad, and then two in the US or otherwise?\n2) Where does Drexel place its finance coops(in the US)? Are coops in top BB and EB banks common? If not, what\u2019s the best way to get into these.\n3) For the international coop, I would prefer for it to be in the UK(I\u2019m a British citizen). How would that look like, regarding finding the coop, pay etc?",

There are certainly IB positions that are available through Drexel's co-op portal, but many of them are at boutique shops (at least in the philly area). To my knowledge, a lot of the the BB IB positions are summer only. If you want to try to land a position at JP, Goldman, Deutsche, etc., I think you may need to be on that cycle and also find something to do with the additional 3 months after the summer ends because I don't think they'd keep you on once the other interns leave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy advice would be to stay on top deadlines for IB summer analysts positions because they hire really far in advance, create a strong resume using the Wall street oasis template, and stay in touch with your co-op advisor. Lastly, keep an open mind. I started out at Drexel with huge expectations and reality hit me hard when I realized there are a lot of talented students out there. But in each of my co-ops I used my experience to land better positions than the last.\n\nedit: checking out r/FinancialCareers may be useful for the international stuff because I don't know anything about that.",

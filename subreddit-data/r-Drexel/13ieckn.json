    "postText": "So I haven\u2019t completed any assignments for CIVE 302 and since it\u2019s week seven I figured I\u2019d cut my losses and withdraw from the class. My problem is that if I drop the class I\u2019ll only be taking 10 credits and I\u2019m not sure how that will affect my financial aid or if it will delay my graduation. I\u2019m a fourth year and doing a five year plan. Any advice? Is it really that bad being a part time student?\n\nUpdate for anyone who cares: I withdrew from the class and it didn\u2019t affect my aid or graduation date\u270c\ud83c\udffcthanks academic advisor",

Usually you can fail or withdraw from a couple before it does. Check if you cumulative gpa at the end of the term will drop to the point where you will lose any aid (you can check the minimum gpa requirement on Drexel connect) this will answer your question. My best guess is don\u2019t withdraw, try ur best in the class now, talk to the professor and just take the L on ur GPA.",

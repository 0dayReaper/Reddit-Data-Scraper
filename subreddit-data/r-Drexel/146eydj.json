    "postText": "Hey never had anyone graduate from college in my family so I was wondering, do we take photos at the graduation? I will be at the Westphal graduation so will there be photographers set up there that we can buy photos from or should we set up our own thing? Also, I might have missed it but where could I do senior portraits",

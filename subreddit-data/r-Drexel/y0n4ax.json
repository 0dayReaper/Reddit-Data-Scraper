    "postText": "For context, I\u2019m a freshman and I\u2019ve been meeting up with friends in the library to study together. I was getting pretty hungry and I had a granola bar in my pocket so I thought it\u2019d be a good snack. I realized 2 bites in that the granola bar was rather warm from being in my pocket all day\u2026 does this count as hot food? It wasn\u2019t super hot but it was a little higher than room temperature.\n\nI immediately threw it away and hoped the security guard didn\u2019t notice me eating it in a study room on the second floor. I know we\u2019re not supposed to eat hot food outside the Dragon Den, will I be put on probation for this? Please advise!",

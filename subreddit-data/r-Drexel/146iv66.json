You might be a bit behind from your peers but it's not the end of the world. As long as you stay vigilant and pass the classes, you'll be good. \n\nBy the way this is my personal experience so I don't know how it'll work out for you since I have no idea what your major is.\n\nIf it helps I took math100 (fundamentals) during my fall quarter, math110 (precalc) during the winter, and math121 (calc 1) during my spring term in my first year. \n\nSo I'm sure that you'll be fine as long as you stay vigilant.\n\n(computer engineering and electrical engineering major if you're wondering)",

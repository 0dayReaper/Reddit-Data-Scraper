The actual lectures were largely discussion based, and he\u2019s an interesting guy even though he can be a bit sleepy at times. Assignments were definitely fair and spaced out from a workload perspective. He was a tougher grader I guess but if you don\u2019t struggle with writing, it shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Also, I remember he preferred to break up large assignments for his approval (concept, rough draft, etc) prior to submitting the final product. Overall shouldn\u2019t be an issue if you put some work in.\n\nEngineering grad for context.",

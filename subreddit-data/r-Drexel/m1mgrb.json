When I was there the men's team was always on the edge of the bubble but never made it in (the year where we beat Nova and Cuse but were left out was especially painful). The women's team was great!\n\nMy first couple of years at Drexel the DAC Pack was basically 30 of us at best, but by the end of my time there it had gotten huge. It's been a while since I've been able to get to Philly for a game but in past years it seemed like the interest had dropped significantly. How's it looking these days? I'm hoping a tournament appearance (and hopefully an upset!!) will help boost interest, though I don't think Drexel will ever become a huge sports school.",

Also, I heard drexel deducts the amount received from external scholarships from their own financial aid. How much truth is in that? Thanks.",

If the payout is directly to Drexel, they might reduce the scholarship but sometimes you can have the payout directly to you too. Drexel themselves also have scholarships that you can apply to once you start.",

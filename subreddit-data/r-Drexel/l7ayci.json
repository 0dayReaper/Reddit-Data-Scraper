The rifle range was going to be turned into a date center but there wasn't a safe/cost effective way to fix the asbestos problem so the room remains empty.",

Asbestos, if encapsulated and left alone does not generally spontaneously give of fibers into the atmosphere. Lead was embedded in most of the walls, necessitating significant abatement work. Steel sheets were hung on the walls to stop the bullets. It was primarily use for .22 calibre rounds.\n\nBefore Thanksgiving every year the Drexel University Rifle Team, or DURT, used to hold an annual \"Turkey Shoot\"...a target competition, with a chance to win a turkey in exchange for paying a small $ fee.\n\nAt the time I had a lab technician who was a National Bench Rest Shooting Association (NBRSA) champion (Heavy Varmint as I recall), and he was never allowed to complete, because he was so good.",

However, I'm technically a resident at Summit right now currently.\n\nIs there a chance that there is resident priority so that I don't need to worry about the waitlist, or am I just sorta fucked and have to (desperately) find housing elsewhere\n\nIdeally I would like to stay at Summit.",

            "comment": "What does your lease say? That will specify when you need to notify your landlord whether you are renewing or moving out. It's still pretty early, so most landlords would allow you to renew now.\n\nThat being said most leases aren't signed till a month or so before move in. You have plenty of time to find a place to live, I haven't even started looking into anything as most places won't advertise September leases for a little while. The only places that lease this early is some student housing, which is probably a poor choice for somewhere to live anyways.",

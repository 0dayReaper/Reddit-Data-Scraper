    "postText": "(~7:45am) For anyone that could take care of animals/knows an animal vet willing, there is a bird at 34th + Powelton, (on the townhome side, second townhome next to bushes) that is hopping around the sidewalk and is unable to fly.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if the bird will still be there but the fella didn\u2019t look like he was going anywhere. The sidewalks were too high for it :(\n\nI would have taken care of it but unfortunately I am running late to work. Putting this out there in case anyone would like to maybe help :)",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, I began an initiative in every single Drexel Dorm this year called \u201cToo Good to Go\u201d\n\nBasically, tons of items get tossed during freshman move out every summer, mostly due to students not having space to transport these items when they move out! Too Good to Go is a leave what you want, take what you want space, entirely designed to prevent excessive waste.\n\nLast year I piloted the program in Millennium Hall and we saved almost 1,000 items from getting tossed. A lot of the stuff is great too! I got a ton of clothes (including brand new Timberland boots, Carharrt jeans, and a Versace tie). If you\u2019re into thrifting or need to furnish an apartment, this event is perfect for you to volunteer for!\n\nRight now, we need volunteers for every dorm building for three official dates. Your job as a volunteer will be to clean up and sort these items, and keep the donation area tidy. The commitment is not huge, and you don\u2019t have to make all three dates.\n\nOn June 17th we will have a \u201cbuy nothing sale\u201d outside select dorms that is open to the community, and then we will pack and ship any leftover items to Goodwill! This is where we will need volunteer help the absolute most.\n\nDay 1: Friday, June 2nd 6-7PM\n\nDay 2: Saturday, June 10th 9:30-10:30\n\nDay 3: Saturday, June 17th 11:30-5 (can be in shifts)\n\nVolunteer Sign up is Here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQCAhKkR910ZmbmjooIG1kwgTLAZJG3DkdKgA1T33_PR_73Q/viewform?usp=sf_link\n\n\nPlease DM me or comment if you have any questions!

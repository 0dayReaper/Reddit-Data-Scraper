I\u2019m currently looking for a roommate to move into my newly renovated 2b2b apartment on 37th street. \n\n- It\u2019s about a 10-12 minute walk to Drexel and Penn\u2019s campus and it\u2019s 2 blocks away from the nearest trolley station\n- The apartment comes with a fully furnished living room including a mounted tv, there\u2019s an in-unit washer dryer system, and there is also an attached balcony. \n- Both rooms come with an attached bathroom and the room I\u2018m looking for someone to take also has a walk-in closet. \n- The building has a finished lobby and finished rooftop as well.\n- Desired rent is $1100 but negotiable!\n\nPlease private message me if you\u2019re interested and I can send over more details!

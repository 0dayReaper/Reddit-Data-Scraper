    "postText": "Hi! Does anyone have any idea of the itinerary of the citizens park commencement on Friday, and how long should we expect the ceremony to last? I dont really know what to expect there, since we will have our individual college graduations throughout the week, where we will do the walk, get the diploma and do a handshake. Will it be same thing at citizens park? Or will we just sit and hear a speech throughout the whole thing?",

Individual school graduation is where you walk, get a fake diploma, etc. Commencement is just something fun with all colleges represented. Commencement you walk on the field and theres usually fireworks if you are into that",

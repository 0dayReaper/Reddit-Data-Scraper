    "postText": "is is possible to retake a class and have that grade replaced by the new one? or would only your gpa be adjusted? bc in the course policy it says gpa is recalculated but I don't understand if the original grade will be there or the newer letter grade? but in theplan of study it mentions that \"not repeatable for credit\" as repeat status so what does that mean?\n\nalso how many times can you retake a class? tips for retaking for pa school prereq? can I take again at community college? HELP! I'm stressed!! \n\nlink for policy  [Repeated Courses and GPA Adjustments: Undergraduate Students - Office of the Provost (drexel.edu)](https://drexel.edu/provost/policies-calendars/policies/course_repeat_policy/)\n\ncontext: i got 2 D's in gen chem (maybe even the entire sequence soon, still in 103 but need 70 on final to pass w D)and I was hoping to redo them for pa school prereqs ( I was on the pre pa track but I did not meet the requirement and I did not know that for traditional path , when you apply most schools look for a C or better so I want to retake those) I am so stress I did not know about the pre req being more than C",

    "postText": "This is so stupid. I was crossing the street today at the intersection by the library and the dragon statue (after the walk signal ended of course) and I tripped. The construction was already bad enough with the dust but now there\u2019s uneven ground too. I hate cars and I hate construction. I was rushing a little bit because of course cars were coming at me cuz I was crossing on a red like an idiot, so I wasn\u2019t really looking where I was going, and then I tripped and fell into one of the holes on Market. \n\nThe hole was a lot bigger than it looked, and my foot went straight down, with the rest of my body immediately following. Yes I did fully fall. Yes it was really embarrassing. Luckily I didn\u2019t break anything (but my knee does really hurt) and I didn\u2019t get hit by any cars, but I am still stuck in the hole on Market Street. Yes I missed my 3pm lecture. The hole was kind of nearest to the corner where the Drexel shuttle stops? It is a LOT deeper than it looks. The road was really bumpy over there and also full of holes apparently. It\u2019s dark in here and my phone battery is running low (on 3% rn). I don\u2019t know exactly where the hole is because I can\u2019t really see, but I think that\u2019s where I am. I tried to take a look except the walls started crumbling when I attempted to climb up, and there was a shuttle passing overhead (I think it was the Dragon route Center City loop shuttle since I could tell by the sun that it was close to 3:15pm). Attendance was required for the lecture I missed so I don\u2019t know how the professor hasn\u2019t come looking for me yet. Does Drexel faculty even care about their students?\n\nI did try calling for help by imitating the whistling flute-like burry single-pitch call of the western North American varied thrush although I don\u2019t think anyone noticed it, despite the varied thrush not being a native species of Pennsylvania. I thought Drexel students were supposed to be smart. If I fell into a hole on Penns campus someone probably would have noticed the non-native bird call and investigated and hence rescued me. But also an Ivy League school probably wouldn\u2019t have random pits on campus. It\u2019s so dark now. I\u2019m getting thirsty. I licked some coffee off the wall after someone's spilled Starbucks trickled down here. I think it may have been a caramel macchiato from the Lebow Starbucks. Tasted like it was made with hate. I\u2019m hungry too... I can smell halal and it\u2019s just making it worse. Send help soon. I think my phone\u2019s about to d",

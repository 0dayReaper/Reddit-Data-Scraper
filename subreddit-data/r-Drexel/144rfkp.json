    "postText": "The looming anxiety associated with this avant-garde interpretation of my abilities -- dropping gradually with every bad test score, every final grade, every moment I study arduously, dedicate time to work only to be slapped by reality and actually genuinely confused why my abilities are rhetorically and literally failing me -- is prying me awake, mortified, disappointed, fearful for my future at stake and desperately pinpointing the fault in my stars spiraling me into failure when I've been committing time to academically prosper (or so I thought). I ponder just how pragmatic every office hours I went to actually were. Just how deceived I am from those all-nighters spent studying masked by an authentic laureate of meritorious mobility. Questioning if I have what it takes to earn a STEM degree",

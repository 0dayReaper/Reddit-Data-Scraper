Everyone was happy that the rec center was open again, but you can kiss that goodbye now.\n\nThink of the people who seriously struggle with online learning and want to go back to in person classes. \n\nThink of the people who live with their elderly parents or grandparents.\n\nThink of the people who have lost their co ops or are being forced into mediocre unpaid co ops.\n\nSeriously, if everyone would stay inside and follow protocols for like two weeks, this could be done and over with. \n\nYou may not think this virus is a real thing because it doesn't affect you directly, but in some way or another it affects everyone around you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSomeone who is now searching for another job to afford to eat because they lost their positions at our rec center and the West Philly YMCA",

It's not just for gaming, or for whatever else you associate with it. It's to have communities where people can be themselves without fearing the consequences. For some, that's gaming. For others (like me), it's business-related. If you're implying people who use Discord are not self-respecting individuals, you're incredibly close-minded.\n\nI'm in 200 Discords for every niche you can think of and I've learned infinitely more from talking to folks who are experienced in areas I actually care about than I have from any of my classes at Drexel. Plenty of people in Greek life likely use Discord communities for their passions, and if you'd like to be a little open-minded about Discord being a place where money is made and passions are found just as much as it's used for gaming you would realize it's not right to write anyone off for using a platform as powerful as Discord. You want it to be a Snapchat or IG group instead? It's not nearly as versatile, and definitely not anonymous by default. Suggest something else since you're so experienced.\n\nDiscord is the best way to bring people together right now, and if you don't want to participate, keep it to yourself. Nobody on this thread is here for you being upset that there are people who aren't afraid to be passionate about something.\n\nStill waiting on you to add me for that 2 minute convo, and for you to add me on Snapchat. Cheering for you.",

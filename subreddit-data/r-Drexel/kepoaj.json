The US legal system is one of 'restorative justice' (i.e. you get hurt, then you get the law to remedy it. There are very few cases of preemptive action and they have specific rules) So I don't advise anyone to take a risk if they want to avoid trouble.\n\nI was memeing.\n\nIt's no comfort to be 'right' if you still have to be out a few hundred bucks, or get a misdemeanor charge that wastes your time.",

Half of the classes will be more stressful than they need to be and you could prob learn more of the stuff on your own quicker and have more time to work on technical projects and not waste time on class assignments and projects. Business knowledge is great too especially if you want to enter the Fintech space.",

I did it really early on in my Freshman year though (Winter term), and catching up hasn\u2019t been too bad but I\u2019m Fall/Winter co-op and some of the intro classes are only offered then so it\u2019s gonna be a bit awkward for me to take them. I think how hard it is to catch up will definitely depend on how far in you are currently.",

I didn't need much help catching up because COE first year is mostly electives like English, math, and science which are required either way.",

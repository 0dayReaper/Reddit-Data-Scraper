    "postText": "I know it\u2019s finals week and everyone must be pretty busy right now, but I need a little bit of help with my SE 181 project (I\u2019m almost done but I\u2019m having some issues with the output). I don\u2019t really know whom to ask for help and there won\u2019t be more office hours after tomorrow and before the deadline (Monday at 5 AM \ud83d\ude2d). I promise I\u2019m not that lost and my questions shouldn\u2019t be too complicated. I\u2019ll buy some coffee if someone is able to help me a little over the weekend.",

An additional concern I have is that they are being so ambiguous about how we will make up course work if we need to quarantine. Only 1 of my 5 classes have said they will also provide remote access for lectures. Why aren\u2019t professors being required to provide any type of contingency when (because it will happen) someone needs to quarantine?",

I\u2019m not fond of the fact that I will be in debt after graduation, but what truly bugs me is paying so much money for an online education. For a lot of people sitting on zoom is not working.

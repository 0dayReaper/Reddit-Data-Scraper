I\u2019m a guy majoring in compsci I know this is kinda late but I need ppl to apartment with because that room and board fee is a lot and I\u2019m sure apartmenting should be cheaper",

Finding ppl to apartment with?",

I am just going to repost it here again. \n\nI would have these before you submit your commuter exemption.\n\n* A parent/guardian who is on board and willing to go through with an exemption. Have a convincing story if you haven't lived in the Philly area that both you and your parent/guardian have created. They will ask.\n\n* Have some sort of ID with your parent/guardian's name on it with the address of the apartment. This is an additional requirement that they don't tell you until the process begins. They usually make it very vague, for instance, mine was conveyed through an email saying \"We need further documentation about your parent/guardian's address. This can be a photo ID\". Have something that you and your parent/guardian feel comfortable with getting.\n\n* Have an actual apartment with a binding lease that has you and your parent/guardian as a tenant AND cosigner. This will not only increase the housing pool available to you for an apartment, but it will also be further documentation down the line. They have asked for a lease during my process. In addition, make sure that your lease is current, meaning that the lease term has already begun. They do not process future leases and will deny your exemption if it is not current. They usually use this as another additional requirement that they spring up during the exemption process\n\nKeep in mind Drexel is running a business, and they make money on blind compliance. There is really no enforcement of the commuter rules, but they will scrutinize your exemption.",

You are going to get gouged freshmen year at the dorms then ACC will take your bag as a Sophmore at Summit, Chestnut Square etc. Only way to get around this is to be listed as a commuter student.  \n\n\nYou should do whatever it takes to figure out how to fake being a commuter student to avoid getting gouged. If you get listed you are good all 4 years :)",

    "postText": " Hi folks,\n\nI'm an incoming transfer student (junior) and I'm looking for off-campus housing. I found some options on the internet, but I thought it might be better to find someone here, that way, we can get to know each other before I move in. I'm willing to pay between $400 and $800 for my room. Although I'm quite shy, I don't mind taking on some household chores like laundry/cleaning.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me, even if you just want to offer advice.",

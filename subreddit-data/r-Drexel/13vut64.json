I\u2019ve tried looking around on this subreddit but I haven\u2019t been able to find much. I know it\u2019s probably different for each class but I would really appreciate it if some people could tell me about their experiences.",

The other has responses every week, a few longer responses throughout the course, a final presentation and a final paper. I love small group discussion classes like these, so they are worth it to me, but for some of them, the workload is a bit much for 1 credit.",

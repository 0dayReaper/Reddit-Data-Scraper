    "postText": "For context, I live in a four person room in The Summit with two of my good friends and one person who I thought would be pleasant to live with. If you can see where I'm going here, he hasn't been pleasant at all after the first week and my other two friends and I are at our last straw with him. We're having a meeting with the leasing office this Friday to try and get him removed from the room, but he has been insistent that we all leave the room instead of him. Does anyone have any idea how I should go about this to convince the leasing office to relocate him to a different room since that would be seemingly easier to relocate 3 different people to a room?\n\ntl;dr - my roommate makes myself and the other 2 people uncomfortable and we want some tips to help grt him out.\n\nUpdate: He decided to move out of his own volition so I guess everything's fine now.",

The next thing is that he took my laundry from our dryer and moved it to the couch without my knowledge nor permission and because of that I'm now missing several articles of clothing. Apologies if this was a little long but I tried keeping it short.",

Him taking your laundry out of the dryer is your fault for leaving it in there. You only have one machine, take the clothes out when they are done. I don't see how him removing the laundry causes clothes to go missing. \n\nYou pay a lot of money to live at Summit, you can call maintenance to have them unclog your toilet. Grow up and learn to take care of yourself instead of coming to reddit to find a way to bully your roommate out of your apartment.",

That being said, my roommates and I were still uncomfortable with living with him and these were just a few of the things he has done as some of the other stuff is a bit too personal to get into. Last night he actually left of his own volition without us having to do anything which was a completely unexpected turn of events. Thank you for your criticism and I will use it as a reference for future experiences.",

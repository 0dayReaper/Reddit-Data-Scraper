    "postText": "I'm a freshman on fall/winter cycle, so starting A round for the first time. I've found a fair amount of postings I think I'm going to send an interview request to, however one posting stands out by a long ways and seems like something I'd be extremely excited to do, and is only posted under beginners/first co-op. I'm wondering, since it doesn't say to send a cover letter but it doesn't say I shouldn't send one, if it would even be worth my time to draft one up and send it. I'm honestly not even 100% sure to who I would send it to but this posting seems like something I want to put a little extra effort into to try and get if it would end up doing something to improve my chances of getting an interview/getting the job.",

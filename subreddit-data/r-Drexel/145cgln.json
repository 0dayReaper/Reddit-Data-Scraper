But ever since I jumped into the field (Senior Database Engineer) and company gave me a Macbook, I have never been more in love. MacBooks are extremely ideal for developers, and would honestly go as far as to say it's better.\n\nAnything outside of school/work, just stick to Windows. Also if you need a desktop, then stick to Windows.",

Don't even sweat Mac vs PC. People will fight over this all day long for one reason or the other. In the vast majority of cases: you'll be fine regardless of what brand or operating system you get. You'll find ways to make things work no matter what. Windows will likely get you an easier experience in terms of software, but you can get the software working on Macs too if you want the features a Mac can provide. Check out the guide for general guidance on specs to get, then find a good deal and something that speaks to your personal preferences from there. Use educational discounts wherever possible. The vast majority of the time you can use college student discounts as an incoming student! COE also offers to work with you on your laptop purchase by reaching out to them if you're feeling really stuck.",

Stay away from \"cheap\" brands like Acer if you want it to last you all 4 years, typically their construction isn't as good and the glue or hinges will fail after a few years. I've had the best experience with Dell. People are going to try and sell you on stuff that has a dedicated graphics card, I honestly don't think it's necessary with strong enough on-board graphics. CAD programs aren't resource intensive enough to require a dedicated graphics card unless you're looking at a complicated figure.\n\nSomething like [this](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-15-6-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-i7-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-natural-silver/6477889.p?skuId=6477889) would be plenty of power for what you'd need for classes.",

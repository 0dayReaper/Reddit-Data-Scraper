    "postText": "I know they only just released for fall and winter, but I only received 2 interviews for my first co-op. I plan to talk to my co-op advisor and see if it is something with my resume, but I am not really sure why I have so little interviews granted. The companies I got interviews from are fairly competitive and I made sure to apply to mostly beginner jobs. Am doing something wrong, has anyone had a similar experience their first co-op? I\u2019m a CS major with little project experience and would also greatly appreciate if anyone wanted to look over my resume as well.",

I got 16 in B round and a job I loved that paid $25 an hour :) \n\nalso, your competition is TOUGH. keep in mind you\u2019re competing with seniors and below. A round in general is pretty brutal, even for upperclassmen we get usually around 5-9 interviews.",

My only confusion is that the interviews I got are from fairly popular and competitive companies in the area. Either way, doesn\u2019t hurt to ask others for review and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again for a less competitive B round.",

This time, I was able to apply to my specific major for all 30. CST Security major.\n\nI have been REALLY lucky to get an offer A round the previous 2 coop cycles.\n\nThe interview themselves are the real hurdle. Do your best in them, and you should be fine.",

For me Im assuming its lack of relevant experience, maybe better luck for final co-op. Kind of regret having my GPA tanked as freshman and barred me from trying for the better first co-ops.",

You can\u2019t be too picky when applying to co-ops for your first cycle so apply to everything that somewhat interests you and it\u2019s better to receive something rather than nothing. Be proud of the interviews you got because your first cycle is by far the hardest in my opinion to get interviews. So take whatever is given to you, and subsequent years are a gonna be a whole lot easier especially if you\u2019re CS.",

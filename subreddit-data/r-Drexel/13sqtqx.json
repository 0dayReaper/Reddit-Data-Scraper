I double major across colleges within Drexel (COAS and Westphal) and it\u2019s worked out pretty well because my majors fit together nicely, and my advisors collaborate to ensure I enroll in the most efficient plan of study. I know only one person who has done programs at two different universities simultaneously and they managed but it was super difficult. It would require total commitment and zero social life/extracurriculars.",

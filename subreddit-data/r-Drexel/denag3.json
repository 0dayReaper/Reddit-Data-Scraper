    "postText": "# WARNING: this is a long post.\n\nLet\u2019s get something straight that most students can agree on: Drexel\u2019s and Aramark\u2019s dining plans are horrible, both in quality and overpricing. In fact, from [Niche's page about Drexel University](https://www.niche.com/colleges/drexel-university/campus-life/), students have rated Drexel\u2019s food provisions as C+ (and I swear to god, NO ONE better make a \u201cthat\u2019s still a passing grade!\u201d joke). In this post I hope to call to attention how it is exponentially better to not be on a dining plan, and at the end discuss Drexel and Aramark's potential options to improve their services.\n\nTable of Contents (Search titles using ctrl+f, cmd+f, or on iOS/Android use the search bar and type the name of the section to see \"Results on This Page\"):\n\n1. Drexel-Run Food Options\n2. Cost Breakdown for Meal Swipes\n3. Why are Dining Plans Priced this Way?\n4. What are my Options Besides Dining Plans?\n5. Grocery Store Options\n6. Food Trucks\n7. Local Restaurants\n8. Cost Comparison for Non-Dining Plan Options\n9. Can Drexel Fix Their Plans?\n\nTL;DR - Drexel's dining plans are heavily overpriced. You can eat comfortably within a budget by price comparing at grocery stores, buying cheap yet filling food truck meals, and eating cheaply at local restaurants. All three options are so much less costly than Drexel's dining plan options. See the sections \"Cost Breakdown for Meal Swipes\" and \"Cost Comparison for Non-Dining Plan Options\" for the most important information you need to know.\n\n=================================\n\n# Drexel-Run Food Options\n\nThe three locations for food that are most popular on campus are the Handschumacher Dining Hall, Urban Eatery, and Northside Dining Terrace.\n\nThe Handschumacher Dining Hall is an all-you-care-to-eat dining options where, for a single meal swipe, you have access to a buffet-style dining area with eight different dining options. Such options include a made-to-order sandwich bar, international cuisine, and an omelet station next to a salad bar. The other option to access this dining hall is to pay with cash or dining dollars: $9.99 for breakfast, $11.99 for lunch, and $14.99 for dinner (as of last year, the prices may have increased this year).\n\nUrban Eatery, located under the Summit apartment building, is split into different stations that are similar to Hans' offerings. There's a grill, pizza/pasta, salad bar, and international cuisine station alongside an all-day breakfast and smoothie bar and a vegan dining station. Prices here range from $6.89 for a pizza to $9.19 for a large salad.\n\nFinally, Northside Dining Terrace is the only non-Aramark run dining option run by Drexel. Three restaurants (Chick-Fil-A, Subway, and AFC Sushi) combine to offer limited menu options, and a market is located next to Subway that has most snacking options that students may need.\n\nNow that we\u2019re familiar with each dining option, let\u2019s dive into the pricing for these locations.\n\nHandschumacher Dining Hall is probably the only place \u201cworth\u201d your money, but because it\u2019s all-you-care-to-eat. Sure, you can get your \u201cmoney\u2019s worth\u201d but that means eating a shit ton of food that most likely is not the healthiest for you. That\u2019s not healthy, at all, especially when common items found at Hans are carb-loaded and greasy foods like burgers and Chinese food. Also considering that over the last few years the dining hall has been faced with [numerous health code violations](https://www.phila.gov/services/permits-violations-licenses/business-licenses-permits-and-approvals/food-businesses/look-up-a-food-safety-inspection-report/) (search for Handschumacher as a keyword and you'll be able to view every report up until 2016 by the Philadelphia Health Inspector's office).\n\nUrban Eatery has ridiculously small portion sizes and is NOT worth the money spent on items. Click here to see what inspired me to write this entire report. I got that sandwich and a bag of chips for **seven dollars and 29 cents**. Salads are priced at $9.19, pizzas are somehow LESS than sandwiches but smaller than ten inches across at around $6.89, and barely anyone eats at the vegan station U.C. Veg. Guess what freshmen, there used to be a sandwich station that was the bomb where U.C. Veg was, but they decided to get rid of it for god only knows why.\n\nAs for Northside Dining Terrace, there\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s the most favored option on campus: *Aramark doesn\u2019t have a direct hand in how it\u2019s run*. There, you can find a Chick-Fil-A, Subway, and AFC sushi with Chinese food options. Chick-Fil-A is almost always swamped, and AFC Sushi and Subway are usually fairly busy during prime hours. These places have semi-decent pricing for their options and are, from a subjective standpoint, much better than anything Aramark is able to serve out of Urban Eatery.\n\n================================================\n\n# Cost Breakdown for Meal Swipes\n\nDrexel has a partnership with Aramark to provide food to students through the use of dining plans. These dining plans are required for freshmen students only; all other undergraduate/graduate students are not required to have a dining plan. [The dining plan options can be found here](https://drexel.campusdish.com/-/media/Local/Higher-Education/GroupC/Drexel/Files/DiningGuide19-20.ashx), but I will summarize the most important information here:\n\n|Name of Plan|Meal Swipes|Meal Exchanges|Dining Dollars|Guest Meals|Cost|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**All-Access**|**Unlimited**|**Up to 21/week (Max 4 per day)**|**$125.00**|**2**|**$1,945**|\n|**Weekly 14**|**14/week**|**Up to 14/week (Max 4 per day)**|**$250**|**2**|**$1,945**|\n|**Weekly 10**|**10/week**|**Up to 10/week (Max 4 per day)**|**$375.00**|**2**|**$1,945**|\n|Combo 75|75/term|Up to 75/term|$500.00|\\-|$1,375|\n|Combo 50|50/term|Up to 50/term|$250.00|\\-|$860|\n|Combo 25|25/term|Up to 25/term|$105.00|\\-|$415|\n|Load Up 750|10/term|Up to 10/term|$750.00|\\-|$750|\n|Load Up 500|5/term|Up to 5/term|$500.00|\\-|$500|\n|Load Up 250|\\-|\\-|$250.00|\\-|$250|\n|Load Up 150|\\-|\\-|$150.00|\\-|$150|\n\nThe first three plans, highlighted in bold, are the three plans freshmen must choose from when signing up for dining options. These plans are extremely predatory due to freshmen students being seen as a \"captive\" audience. They must pay for a plan regardless of whether they want to or not, and because of this, Aramark can charge any rate that they want. For proof, see the below table:\n\n|Meal Plan|Meal Swipes Total per Term (Estimated 10 weeks/term)|Cost of Plan Minus Dining Dollars|Cost per Meal Swipe|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**All-Access**|21/week \\* 10 Weeks = 210|$1,945 - $125 = $1,820|$1,820 / 210 = $8.67|\n|**Weekly 14**|14/week \\* 10 Weeks = 140|$1,945 - $250 = $1,695|$1,695 / 140 = $12.11|\n|**Weekly 10**|10/week \\* 10 Weeks = 100|$1,945 - $375 = $1,570|$1,570 / 100 = $15.70|\n|Combo 75|75 per Term|$1,375 - $500 = $875|$875 / 75 = $11.67|\n|Combo 50|50 per Term|$860 - $250 = $610|$610 / 50 = $12.20|\n|Combo 25|25 per Term|$410 - $105 = $305|$305 / 25 = $$12.20|\n\n**The most costly plan is the Weekly 10 plan, where meal swipes cost f%cking $15.70 EACH**. That doesn't even equate to what the cost of paying for dinner at Handschumacher costs, for comparison.\n\n==================================================\n\n# Why Are Dining Plans Priced this Way?\n\nSimply put, dining plans are priced this way because students are a captive audience for Aramark. Drexel University requires students to have a dining plan for their first three terms during freshmen year. That equates to $5,845 spent on food alone. Yet students will never get their money's worth from it... because think of the logic behind the All-Access plan. What student is going to use three meal swipes per day? You have so many other options for food around campus that most students go for, such as food trucks and local pizza places. Events held by Drexel have food almost all the time, and the time cost of going to Hans every day would be taxing on students since they have to walk from their dorm building to Hans and back. Logistically it's not expected that every student uses all 210 meal swipes in a term.\n\nSo Aramark and Drexel offer lower meal swipe plans with more dining dollars. Ah, but see... dining dollars are only worth using at Northside since Northside restaurants don't accept meal swipes. So as students you're inclined to use the meal swipes more often than the dining dollars since you have substantially less worth. That's why the price per meal swipe increases from $8.67 to $12.11 between the All-Access and Weekly 14 plans respectively: in exchange for 7 less meal swipes per week, you're given $125 more dining dollars. You can buy almost any item at Urban Eatery for less than the cost of a meal swipe, which truthfully only includes a drink and a side.\n\nThis is business at work between Aramark and Drexel: **any meal swipes not used by students are free money for the university. Multiplied by a couple thousand students not using all of their meal swipes, and Aramark and Drexel are rolling in the dough. From a consumer's perspective, this is suspiciously predatory.**\n\n============================================================\n\n# What are my Options Besides the Dining Plan?\n\nNearly every undergraduate student will tell you never to go back to the dining plan after Freshman year because you can eat for far, far cheaper on campus. The following sections discuss the three most prominent options for eating on campus for less than what the dining plans charge: grocery stores, food trucks, and eating from local restaurants.\n\n=============================\n\n# Grocery Store Options\n\nGrocery stores are hard to come by nearby Drexel's campus, but they are your source for the cheapest way to stay alive while studying at Drexel University. Here's the most popular options for grocery stores listed in order from best priced to most expensive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Name of Store|Location|Inexpensive/Expensive|Highlights|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Acme**|**Corner of Market and 16th Street; walk or take the MFL line from 34th street to 15th street.**|**Inexpensive**|**Competitively priced; go online for coupons and deals. Many common name brands for cheap.**|\n|Old Nelson Food Company|Along Lancanster Avenue, next to Urban Eatery/Summit.|Expensive|Lots of international options for food; some|\n|GIANT Heirloom Market|3401 Chestnut Street, down the street from Wawa on the opposite side of the street.|Expensive|Many locally sourced and organic options. Similar to Trader Joe's. Cheaper options are GIANT private label items.|\n|Fresh Grocer|4001 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104. Decent walk, over on Penn's campus. Can take MFL line to 40th Street station.|Expensive|More expensive than most options on campus due to being the only \"real\" grocery store in University city.|\n|**Aldi's**|**4421 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19104. Take the MFL line from 34th street to 46th street; Aldi's is right next to the station.**|**Inexpensive**|**The CHEAPEST prices you'll find for any groceries on campus. Guaranteed to not find name brands you're familiar with, but everything is cheap to justify the trip. Quality is still pretty good.**|\n|Trader Joe's|2121 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19103. Walk down Market St. over the bridge, two blocks past the river.|Expensive|Similar to GIANT; fresh produce and organic options but for expensive prices. Usually very busy, plan for long lines for checkout.|\n\nIn short, Aldi's and Acme are the cheapest options for groceries for students. GIANT Heirloom market is good enough if you're in a pinch for some ingredients or meals. I would personally recommend avoiding Old Nelson and Fresh Grocer at all costs due to high prices. Trader Joe's is very popular among students who can afford them.\n\n================\n\n# Food Trucks\n\nYou can't go a week at Drexel without hearing someone getting food from a food truck, and for good reasons. These trucks can afford to have amazingly good prices because they don't face the same costs as brick-and-mortar restaurants face. Food trucks must account for food material costs and labor mostly which allows them to shave off cost from their products. Nearly every food truck has good pricing for their items. As time goes on and I try out different food trucks I will edit this post with pictures and new entries for the best options for food on campus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Name of Food Truck|Location|Best Meal Deal|Cost|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Andy's Food Truck (Chinese)|White food truck on Arch Street next to the Volleyball courts. Next to Happy Sunshine Truck.|Chicken and Beef Teriyaki over Noodles|$6.00 - Massive portion, can never personally finish one meal.|\n|Momma Telly's BBQ|Small stand outside the Armory on 33rd Street. Guy working the stand is always standing outside the cart. They added seating thank god!|Chicken BBQ over Jasmine Rice w/ Onions and Balsamic Sauce|$5.00 - Very, very good, but they take their damn sweet time making orders :(|\n|Halal Food Trucks|Spread around campus; most popular locations are along 33rd Street close to Market St. You've seen them. I know you have.|Chicken/Lamb/Fish/Falafel over Rice w/ Salad and White Sauce (Hot Sauce Optional)|$6.00 - Fun fact, the meals used to be $5 but other food trucks complained they couldn't compete with the low prices. So they increased prices!|\n|Mike's Burger Stop|Along Market St next to the DAC entrance. Small little silver cart.|Burger meal with/without cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato, serve-yourself sauce toppings. Fries and drink included.|$5.00 - Probably the best burger deal on campus. Not too many fries but the burgers are fantastic. Bacon can be added for $1!|\n|Cucina Zapata|End of Food Truck Alley behind Main Building. Walk to 31st and Ludlow street intersection, they're right there.|Chicken Katsu or Cap'n Crunch Tilapia Burrito|$5.00/$6.00 respectively. One of the most popular food trucks on campus for lunch. I've only ever heard good things about the truck and their food.|\n|Happy Sunshine Truck|Yellow truck located next to Volleyball courts. Next to Andy's Food Truck.|Any breakfast items.|$2.00-$5.00 for sandwiches, but the size and quality make them worth it.|\n\nThese are just some of the cheapest options for food on campus. Alongside Cucina Zapata are about six or seven other food trucks that are very good as well in both quality and pricing. Along Market Street you'll find some popular options such as Dos Hermanos Tacos, a Mexican truck that's a bit more pricey but very good.\n\n=======================\n\n# Local Restaurants\n\nBesides the nearly thirty restaurants located directly within Drexel's campus, there are many other options for dining around University City. The **best pizza places** are Drexel Pizza (33rd Street and Arch Street), Ed's Buffalo Wings and Pizza (Lancaster Avenue), Mad Greek's Pizza (Lancaster Avenue), Savas Brick Oven Pizza (Lancaster Avenue), and California Pizza (33rd and Powelton). **30th Street Station**, the major train hub of Philadelphia for SEPTA and Amtrak, also has a large amount of restaurants, including Taco Bell, Subway, Cosi, Jersey Mikes, Wendy's, Beck's Cajun Cafe, and others. In addition, you can always **head over to University of Pennsylvania's campus and check out their food truck options**. Many of theirs are just as cheap if not cheaper than Drexel's food trucks, but can be a walk to get to.\n\nLocal restaurants will not be cheaper than food trucks, but you will find nearly any cuisine you want. I encourage you to go out and explore restaurants and competitively price them; see what deals are offered.\n\n============================================================\n\n# Cost Comparison for Non-Dining Plan Options\n\nSo let's take the three options for dining on Drexel and compare them to the prices for dining plans.\n\nTo use a meal swipe for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, the cheapest price you will pay per swipe is $8.67 with the All-Access plan. That's $8.67 times 21 meals per week for ten weeks, totaling $1,820.70 for the entire term.\n\nAnd finally, grocery stores. Cheapest option by far if you shop smart and compare prices. Aldi's and Acme, as explained earlier, are the cheapest prices I have found for groceries but involve walking or riding the subway to get to them (but round-trip cost is $4.00 for the subway. The savings you get more than make up for the transportation cost). GIANT Heirloom Market and Trader Joe's are the best sources for natural/organic products, but expect a higher cost. I'd personally recommend avoiding Fresh Grocer and Old Nelson simply because they charge the highest prices that you could find alternatives for at other grocery stores.  I can't really calculate cost because it's hard to compare all grocery store price options in a single reddit post, but we all know grocery stores are the cheapest options for food because you make the dishes yourself instead of paying additional costs for someone else to make it for you.\n\nFood trucks offer breakfast items for no more than $5.00. You can get a LOT of lunch and dinner options on campus for less than $6.00, but let's assume you get a drink ($1.50-$2.00) and a side ($1.50) with each meal. Assuming you bought the costlier option for every meal each day of the week, you'd be spending $35 for breakfast and $8.00-$10.00 for lunch and dinner meals, totaling $112 to $140 per week for lunch/dinner. **Total, that comes out to $147-$175 per week, or $1,470-$1,750 per term for dining.** **This is already better than the dining plan. Take mind, however, to the fact that many food truck options are CHEAPER than this!** For example, halal carts give you a can of your choice of beverage with a meal purchase. That's $6,00 for a large meal AND drink. While I DON'T (!) recommend getting Halal for 14 meals each week, that comes out to $84 for a week of lunch and dinners. Plus $35, that's $119 per week for food, or $1,190 for a term's worth of food. See what I'm getting at now? There's plenty of cheap options to change up what kinds of meals you get.\n\nFor local restaurants, prices are much more costly. Popular options such as Shake Shack and Chipotle offer some good deals, but at the end of the day are more expensive. These options will be more expensive than meal swipes, but often make up for the price if you don't add tons of additional ingredients. Let's look at a Chipotle bowl: $7.50 base price for chicken or veggies. You can get rice, beans, fajita veggies, pico de gallo, sour cream, cheese, corn/onion salsa, and lettuce at no extra charge. You can also get away with asking for an extra scoop of rice or beans too. **The total price for the cheapest meat option at Chipotle comes out to $8.10 for a bowl, which is already less than the lowest meal swipe cost**. Many other locations like pizza places and Chinese take-out restaurants offer cheap meal options and special deals too, so look around on Yelp or Google Maps to find some of the cheap options available to students.\n\n# FOR FRESHMAN STUDENTS: GET THE ALL ACCESS PLAN OR 14 WEEKLY PLAN! If you're gonna be roped into a dining plan, choose the option that gets you the most value, and spend all your meal swipes. Buy an upperclassmen friend something with a meal swipe once in a while... ;)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n====================\n\n# Can Drexel Fix Their Plans?\n\nHonestly, I don't think Drexel plans to fix their dining options anytime soon. Due to them outsourcing dining to Aramark, our real concerns/complaints as students should be directed to Aramark itself and the managers that run Urban and Handschumacher. However, I've submitted complaints myself and nothing has come of them from what I've seen. Employees taking their sweet time to get up from the chair to come make my food, or standing around talking with each other while I wait for them to make my order (and I can see them doing nothing), or making kind of awkward/weird jokes that make students uncomfortable are just some of the issues with customer service.\n\nUntil Drexel's students REALLY start petitioning for better dining options or bringing it up to President John Fry or anyone at Student Life, we will not see improvements in Dining at Drexel.",

Get a full size sandwich for $5-6. Good quality. Generally very busy during peak hours.\n\n5th comment\n\nVENTURE OUT OF THE CITY TO GET DRINKS OTHER THAN WATER OR SELTZER. The soda tax and buying drinks individually is a joke. I can literally get 24 16 Oz bottles of soda or iced tea for $10 plus tax at Redners in Bensalem. Lasts me weeks (I don't drink much soda). I buy 36 packs of Spring water for $4. A brita is a very solid investment if you think philly tap tastes bad.",

You are correct that you get the best value from the all included plan, but it has a higher absolute cost. If you need to scrounge, you will be budgeting you meals anyway. For freshmen, the dining plan is a sunk cost, so why bother with a plan that costs more. You can only eat so much food, to \"get\" your money's worth eventually you'll be swiping in just to get food for the trashcan. \n\nUltimately this is just part of the cost for Drexel. It really seems like food got worse than I remember, and it wasn't great to begin with. I hope it gets better, you should petition it.",

The business model is high everyday prices, big sales, and if you don't take advantage of sales and coupons, you'll almost certainly pay more than at Trader Joe's. Base price of Maier's white bread at Acme was $2.99 last week vs $2.49 at Trader Joe's for Canadian White. The Trader Joe's bread is better quality than the Maier's too.",

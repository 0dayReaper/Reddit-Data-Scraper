    "postText": "One of my goals when I entered Drexel was to avoid Kurt Schmidt at all costs. Every quarter I've  lived with the fear of being forced to take one of his classes. Next quarter I have no choice but to take CS360 with this man. The man whose name is known all over CCI and is synonymous with pain and suffering. I feel like I have lost before I even started. I'm not the best academically(but I'm able to get by), and I suck at taking tests, so I feel like I'm about to be thrown into a lion's den wearing a meat suit. In about 74 days I will be stepping into the den with Shmidt, armed only with my half-baked coding skills. I've heard stories of people walking into his class as hopeful young coders with dreams of becoming the next Mark Zukerburg, and then coming out empty husks of who they once were. A man whose stare alone is capable of freezing your code mid-run. As you can tell, I am terrified. Anyway, what should I expect? How time consuming and painful are his tests, quizzes, homeworks, labs, etc? How is cs360 in general too? Is it a lot of difficult concepts? Do a lot of people fail this class with him?",

He's actually a nice guy and grades fairly in my opinion. I got something like a B in his class, but that was because I was working and didn't put anywhere near 100% effort into it.\n\nYou'll have to work for an A, but if you pay attention, do the assignments and readings, come to class, and ask if you have any questions, you'll be fine.",

He just has a kind of old-school, no-nonsense personality that I think makes people think that he's a dick, and their first intro to him is usually the BASH and Linux focused class which is a pretty steep learning curve for most people. So long as you put in an honest effort and reach out when you need help you'll be fine.",

He'll ding you on tiny details (which is not bad) but the rules change. Because of that, I think that the high demand is unfair, but only in combination with the inconsistency. Honestly, I think he likes tripping up students on assignments to raise his own ego. He will help you learn by being your adversary, not your friend, and that's why he gets a bad reputation. I had this talk with the dept head years ago but based on the reactions he's still the same.",

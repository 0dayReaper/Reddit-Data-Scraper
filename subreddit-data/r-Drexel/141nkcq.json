    "postText": "\\[Mods I am posting this as a separate post because my older questions in the prospective student thread never got answered\\]\n\nI have an admit from Drexel for MS CS and I am really excited about it. I am from a non-tech background and wish to transition to SDE roles after my MS. However, I gues companies prefer that candidates applying for jobs have professional skills such asfront end web development, backend web development, etc.\n\nSince the MS CS curriculum does not cover these skills, I guess I will need to learn them in my spare time. Since Drexel has a rigorous quarter system, I was worried if I will get the free time to learn these skills?\n\nCan any professor or MS CS student shed some light on this?",

My roommate and I are looking to sublet our apartment in West Powelton in February or March and the landlord would be happy to provide a sublet lease from then for as long as you need past 12 months (can choose to end your lease in June if you are going to graduate in a year). 2 bed, 1 bath for $1295/month + electric. All other utilities (including WiFi!!) are included. Apartment is the entire first floor, basement (with washer and dryer), and private backyard. I also have an extra microwave that I would be happy to leave in the apartment for you to keep and use.\n It is right on Drexel's Powelton/Spring Garden Route as well as within UPenn's transportation limits.\nWe are closing on a house and do not need this apartment anymore, so please let me know if you have any questions or for more details!",

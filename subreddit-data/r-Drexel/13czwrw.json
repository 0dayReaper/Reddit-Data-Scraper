If it's Gerri Hall, send an email to lcbtech@drexel.edu from your Drexel email address with your university ID number and I'll take a look, but my answer will likely be that you need to talk to the DragonCard office. Anyone with a valid DragonCard should be able to get into Gerri Hall during normal class hours, so really the only reason you shouldn't be able to get in is a problem with the card itself.",

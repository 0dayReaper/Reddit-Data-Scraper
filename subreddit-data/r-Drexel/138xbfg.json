That\u2019ll naturally drive the price of rents up since landlords will take what they can get.If you don\u2019t want to drive the price or rents up then go to school in your own neighborhoods.",

Even activists know they have to look out for themselves somewhat, and there are just a lot more opportunities in cities. But while they are here what\u2019s wrong with advocating in other ways to help the native Philadelphians?",

People don\u2019t grow by staying in the same environment, they grow through dedication and oppertunity.",

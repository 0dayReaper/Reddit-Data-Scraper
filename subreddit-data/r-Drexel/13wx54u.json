    "postText": "Hi. I just got off the waitlist for Nova. I wasn't accepted to my first choice major of Computer Science, but I've been accepted into the College of Engineering for electrical engineering. I'm committed to Drexel and would be paying about 7k there, while if I were to switch over to Villanova I'd be paying around 9k. I have 7 days to make a deposit and don't know if I should just stick with going to Drexel. Thanks",

This can make it much easier for you to find a job down the road. Drexel is a good choice but if you ever thought of leaving the northeast I don\u2019t think employers would be familiar with Drexel. Just wanted to give you a different perspective",

That and OP got admitted to their top major at Drexel and pays less for tuition too. I don\u2019t see why Villanova is the better option in OP\u2019s case here. Villanova is a better school ranking and reputation wise yes, but not the better option in this situation",

It's cheaper, you get into CS, and you get co-op.\n\nPeople say Villanova cuz its better (and it's true, I'd rather go to Villanova tbh) but at the end of the day:\n\n\\- For CS, people don't give a rats ass if you went to Drexel vs Villanova. Maybe MIT or Stanford sure but meh for mid-tier schools.\n\n\\- It's cheaper when you include co-op earnings. You save a lot and why go into debt for a piece of paper when you can get a free piece of paper\n\n\\- Co-op helps pay for the degree and you get paid in college and you get experience\n\n\\- You get into CS. It's what you wanted.",

Every professor is good, the head professor, Brian Stuart kicks so much ass. Plus the co-ops are great. Your second year of college can start with you being paid $26 an hour doing some web development for a legit company (this was one of my friends not made up).",

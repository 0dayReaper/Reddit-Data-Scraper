I graduated with a 3.97 gpa (woot, woot!) with my Master's in Teaching, Learning, and Curriculum while being homeless for six months and juggling two jobs. I wasn't able to afford getting all this at the beginning of the summer and a stranger from reddit sent this my way. So thank you!  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4321n6bn7tk71.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4c4129f6dbe221b83b5f258049bb515f07679917\n\nNow I have been contracted for a full-time teaching position! If anyone needs this specific cap, gown, and hood (Master's from the School of Education) please let me know. I'd love to send this your way, free of charge.",

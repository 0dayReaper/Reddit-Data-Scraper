Coarser particles are likely to drop out of suspension closer to the source, and finer ones would travel further, depending on their composition/density, morphology, and atmospheric currents, turbulence, etc.\n\nA cloth mask may provide some limited protection, and is better than nothing, but N95 or KN95 would be better.",

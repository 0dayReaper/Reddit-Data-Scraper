    "postText": "In DegreeWorks, we have this little component of CS electives, worth 6 credits. Someone I know is a junior at CCI and they told me that we can convert these electives into CCI electives, meaning that instead of being restricted to only CS classes, we can take classes with codes INFO/SE/DSCI/CT. The advisor was confused when I discussed this with her. Maybe I interpreted something wrong. Hope someone can clarify that. In case I am wrong, that's fine and I am happy to realize that. Thanks!",

However, it cannot be counting towards one of your declared concentrations. Is this clear enough for you to understand?  \n\n\nProbably this means that only select courses can be non-CS, not all of them.",

    "postText": " Hello everyone,\n\nI am an international student from Germany who will be starting at the university in the upcoming Fall Quarter. I am seeking recommendations for the best accommodation option available. Specifically, I would like to know which hall, Stiles, North, or Carneries, would be suitable for an Electrical Engineering student like myself.\n\nAdditionally, I have heard about American Campus as another housing provider. Should I consider applying for accommodation through them as well? If so, I would appreciate any suggestions on which property to choose.\n\nThank you all for your assistance and advice. I greatly appreciate it.",

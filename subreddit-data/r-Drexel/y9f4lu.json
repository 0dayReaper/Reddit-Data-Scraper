    "postText": "With the recent uptick in crime I've had to take extra precaution around campus. I never expected this to happen to me but I'm glad I was prepared. \n\nEarlier today, I was minding my business outside the library when a ruffian came up from behind me and held a blunt object against my back. \"This is a hammer,\" he said, \"and if you don't give me your wallet right now I'm going to bash your skull in.\" By Mario, I was scared, but like I said I've prepared myself for this exact scenario. I've begun exercising my rights as the founding fathers intended. \n\nIn one elegant maneuver, I pushed his hammer away and drew back, putting 3 paces of distance between us. Simultaneously, I drew my flintlock. \"Tally ho lad!\" I exclaimed, firing upon him. Because it was a smoothbore, I missed him by a narrow margin, putting a golf ball sized hole through the nearest halal cart. Fortunately I had prepared for this exact scenario. The ruffian, now realizing he was quite literally outgunned, turned his back to retreat. My bullet travels faster. I drew a second flintlock (I keep this in case the first gets a wet fuse) and blasted a lead sphere in his direction. Unfortunately this one missed too, obliterating an unsuspecting business major's venti mochiotto latte. \n\nI was lucky today. If I wasn't prepared I could be in a much worse position. I implore it upon you all to take the appropriate measures to ensure safety, just as the founding fathers intended.",

Personally, I never travel without keeping my short sword handy. I can't imagine what would have happened if you did not have your second flintlock with you!",

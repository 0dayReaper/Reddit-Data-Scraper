There may be an fee for the use of the space similar to a lab fee(don't remember because it has been a hot minute since I have graduated), but I ended up taking guitar lessons for a few terms as an engineering student. I never took piano lessons there so I can't vouch for how good those professors are, but it is an option.",

They offer practice rooms to practice if you are enrolled in any of these classes.\n\nThe instructors use Alfred's Basic Adult All-In-One Piano Course book to teach the class, which you can find online for free.",

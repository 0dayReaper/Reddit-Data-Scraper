    "postText": "Hello, I am an international student doing 5 year/ 3 co-ops and i understand that there are some visa restrictions to doing the third co-op and wanted to cancel it. However, i have the senior design project in my last year and don\u2019t know if i can graduate early because of that. Have any engineering students cancelled their last co-op and moved the senior design?",

There has to be a valid reason like you can\u2019t graduate on time, you couldn\u2019t find a co-op, or you switched program and things don\u2019t match. If you dont have a valid reason which gets approval from your academic &amp; co-op advisor then I don\u2019t think you can just cancel it. But I could be wrong so make sure to talk to your advisors about it.",

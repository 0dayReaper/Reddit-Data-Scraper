    "postText": "Today at drexel park was probably the first real random human interaction I\u2019ve had in the past year and a half, and it made me so happy. A couple were flying a kite for a while and me and my roommates were watching them, and when they stopped we asked if we could borrow it for a bit. They said we could have it, but that we should also give it away to the next people who might want it. \n\nI played with the kite for a while, talking to whoever was interested and having a good time. Had a good conversation with a drexel grad who was going to med school in AZ- I truly hope you do well my man. After a while, I saw a mom and her kids who were playing on the sidewalk and having a good time, so I brought the kite over to them and asked if they wanted it. \n\nIt absolutely made their day to get a random gift from somebody. And it made my day to see them happy and playing outside. It was really the first time since FEB2020 that I have been able to have fun with people without questioning their activities in the past 2 weeks. \n\nIf you are vaccinated, hell yeah. If you\u2019re not, get going, so everyone can have positive, non stressful interactions. \n\nAlso, if you are so inclined, it only costs like $20 to make your day and somebody else\u2019s. I fully intend to get a kite and give it away to make somebody\u2019s day. \n\n\nTL:DR\nAll hail frydaddy, get vaxxed, spread some happiness.",

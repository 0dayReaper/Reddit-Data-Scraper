Complete with signature dishes like *Oddly bubbly pizza*, *3 day old corn*, and *I can't believe it's not leather*, our revolutionary menu antiquates pesky immigrant owned small businesses so that students can be better fed by the same corporate overlord that makes prison food!\n\nDon't worry about the food truck owners/employees though guys! Any day now we'll get an email from John Fry reaffirming that 'Drexel deeply cares for the diverse local community' so you can rest assured their livelihood or the livelihood of the family they support isn't in any danger at all! \ud83d\ude0a",

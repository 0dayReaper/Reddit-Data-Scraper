    "postText": "Hello,\n\nMy name is Vincent, I am currently a local college student in Philadelphia and I am looking for some tenants (preferably students) for the house I am renting out at. I will be the property manager and will handle most of rent negations, house concerns, and communication with the property owner. \nI am looking for two tenants to room the middle room and the smaller room but they are both similar in terms of square footage. It will be fully furnished and some of the things can be taken away if needed! \n\nLocation: It is located around 26th and Cecil B Moore (Can\u2019t Disclose for Safety Reasons lol)\n\nWhich is 7 minutes from Temple Uni and about 10 Minutes from Drexel Uni (The Summit)\n\nBiggest Question: Rent?\nWe are looking for a lease of at least a year at the rate of 600-650 utilities included. But it is negotiable so let me know!\n\nI will be interviewing tenants who are interested but so please let me know ASAP\n\nOne requirement for living with me: Please be a cleanly person, for the most part I am easygoing LOL\n\nA little about me:\n\nI am Vietnamese Asian American, I work a 9-5 while going to night classes as well. I tend to reciprocate energy so if you\u2019re cool, I am cool. I am a gamer, usually playing Valorant and I don\u2019t mind guests. Love music, food, film, and also my quiet too. But I am a very communicative person so I will give you a heads up of I have concerns or if I\u2019m bring anyone over. But if you\u2019re curious about me, hit me up and and we connect. If interested in the home let me know! I am totally open for house tours as well.\n\nYou can find me on Facebook as Vincent Dang and on IG as 8th_vince\n\nTake care and thank you for the time.",

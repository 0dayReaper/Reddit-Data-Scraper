Here's what's going on.\n\nWhen you check the \"Don't ask again for 60 days\" box, DrexelConnect sends your browser a cookie to identify that device. When you next sign in, your device sends the cookie back to DrexelConnect. If the cookie is still current, the MFA confirmation is skipped.\n\nClearing your cookies on a device erases the cookie that holds the device id. With no device id cookie, DrexelConnect doesn't know that you wanted to skip MFA re-confirmation from that device.\n\nThe reason that Blackboard Mobile doesn't honor the \"Don't ask again for 60 days\" setting is because the Bb app doesn't appear to handle cookies from the authentication process. To have let Bb know about this.",

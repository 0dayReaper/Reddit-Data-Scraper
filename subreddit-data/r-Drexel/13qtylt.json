Members can be extremely active members, or extremely passive members. What doesn't change is the visibility of the content in each server; if I want to learn about music production, I have a server to look into at any point, for years to come as future students join and share this interest and want to find other students also into it so they don't feel so lonely.\n2. For one, I am trying to find people at my school who are into similar topics. I am also starting the servers for folks who are very passionate about their own niche and would like to take ownership. For example, I'm not super big on Beauty, but I started the Discord for people who are. And anyone who's passionate about Beauty will take ownership as soon as they let me know they're interested.\n3. Drexel has close to no culture, and I'd like to change that before I drop out.",

                                    "comment": "While I do already have the Drexel Passion Network as a general place to discuss all niches/passions/interests, there are almost always at least 10 separate channels (or like you said, subgroups) necessary for each niche to be explored in detail.\n\nExample: Drexel Music Production has an individual channel for each genre of music production including hiphop, rock, edm, pop, jazz, classical, country/folk, rnb/soul, blues, reggae, latin, ambient/chill/lofi, funk, and metal. I'll be adding more as people request them, because they want a specialized place rather than one channel to discuss it all. I also won't have any requirements for this, if someone feels that their passion isn't being properly represented yet, I'll do everything I can to make that happen.\n\nIf anyone wants to have generalized conversations about something as broad as \"technology\", they can do so in the Drexel Passion Network Discord:  [https://discord.gg/4dCHWn4ZMs](https://discord.gg/4dCHWn4ZMs)\n\nBut we can both agree that technology might include something like a cool lamp, while it can also include AI as a general industry/practice area. You see what I mean? It's too generalized, and people aren't engaged when something doesn't actually speak to who they are and what they actually care about. If I'm into AI, I don't want to read the messages coming from 30 AI haters in the technology channel who haven't even tried using it in their daily workflow. For this reason, there should be (and already are) AI Discords! In this case, I would just be approaching the leaders of these Discords and offering my help in spreading the word, or asking them if they want to join the Passion Network to be promoted for nothing in exchange.\n\nI intentionally started the \"Drexel Sports Hub\" (invite: https://discord.gg/P3uv5VRcgD) knowing there are people extremely passionate about each sport I have in there from Basketball to Badminton to Water Polo to Ultimate Frisbee. Whoever is the most passionate in these sports should start their own Discord for their sport, and I'd be happy to advise them on how to format the server/generate interest/not die within a day. I'm not starting 30+ sports Discords myself, but we should have them and I will help them grow very quickly.\n\nI'm giving people a place to discuss their passions/niches, in depth, with specified channels in each server because that is what has allowed me to find like-minded folks online who are as passionate as me, even though I will never meet them in real life. I haven't found many people at Drexel as passionate as me for nearly all of the niches I really involve myself in/care about, but I hope that in starting these Discords I will find many folks, and onboard plenty more to pursue/try new passions so they can explore themselves, find cool people, and see Discord as a place they love rather than a place they kinda like.\n\nIf people don't want to be anonymous, they have the option to reveal their identities. Most people have not remained anonymous so far in the Drexel servers I've been starting, which is pretty interesting! I'm personally doxxed already, my name is Dmitrii, and I introduce myself to everybody in each separate server with a new intro based on what's relevant. Here's my intro for the Drexel Content Creation Discord:  \nHey everyone, my name is Dmitrii. I'm currently working on building a personal brand centered around self help, personal growth, and fulfillment. I love seeing people pursue their passions!\n\nAnd here's my intro for the Drexel Personal Finance Discord:\n\nHi everyone! I\u2019m Dmitrii. I\u2019ve been into personal finance, long term investing, and credit building since I was about 16 yrs old. I\u2019m a senior at Lebow now, hoping to purchase my first rental property within the next year. Excited to reach new heights with you all! \r\n\nI am speaking from a place of experience. I've learned almost everything I know about the niches I care about from Discord servers like the ones I am starting. Most of them required payment, and I'm starting them for all Drexel students for free. Plenty of other universities have Discord servers for specific niches, and there's no reason not to make every single person at this school feel special with their own server, specific to their niche. Everyone deserves to feel like they belong, and everyone will have this \"luxury\" (it's crazy that it's a luxury) that should honestly have been fulfilled a long time ago.\n\nI hope that makes some sense, and I hope you have a great day! :)",

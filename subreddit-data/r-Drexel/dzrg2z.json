They gave blanket resume advice to a room full of people from wildly different majors and they made us make our resumes all look pretty much the same. They made us take Myers Briggs and do a class exercise on it. \n\nThe worst part about it was definitely the mock video interviews. They made it so we each had to do three mock interview questions ranging in length from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. Then they had us upload those to this platform. Then they had our presentations be graded by other classmates. It was miserable, and since it was anonymous, people were totally ruthless. Of course the interview clips seemed super forced and rehearsed because everyone was rehearsing them like crazy. It was nothing like a real video interview, even the automated ones that only give you like a minute to think about the question. I got dinged constantly for \u201cseeming nervous\u201d and \u201cnot seeming comfortable\u201d when it\u2019s like the most uncomfortable thing in the world to do. At one point, one of the instructors started playing the videos IN CLASS so you got to watch 30 of your peers you barely know stare at you stuttering over where you see your career in five years.",

It was only made worse by the fact that I had accepted an offer MONTHS before I even took the class so their advice was useless to me.",

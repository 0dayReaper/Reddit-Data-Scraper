    "postText": "Hey guys, incoming international freshman here, I was wondering how safe the campus and neighbouring areas are. I saw some news about shootings around drexel and that got me a bit scared. I have never been to philadelphia so it would be great if you could tell how safe it is. Are there any areas to avoid? Anything else I should keep in mind?",

Even at night. \n\nDefinitely want to avoid going too far off campus (maybe 5 blocks) and Temple is pretty sketchy from my anecdotal experience (car broken into).\n\nIt's pretty typical for an American city, just be aware. If you're planning on being under the influence, travel in groups.",

North of campus is where it gets sketchy. Be smart, always walk with someone when it is dark out. Be aware of your surroundings, don\u2019t be like one of the million people on campus with headphones in and not a clue what\u2019s going on around them",

Crime shouldn't be much of an issue, especially in Powelton Village.  But I'd always recommend living in center city, more availability for apartments and some nicer neighborhoods, depending on what you can afford and want.",

Don't be afraid to explore the city, but keep your wits. Also, this is a city so there are many people around, and Philly is primarily a working class city, so many of these people aren't going to be wearing fancy suits or anything, but instead look like middle/lower class people. People have to get to work, many people get on/off at 34th and 30th or on the busses etc etc etc.",

IMHO I did feel safer on Drexel's campus compared to Penn's. You can download the citizen app if you want to keep up to date on crime alerts, but it honestly made me more paranoid after some time. Drexel also has a \"walking buddy\" service if you find yourself out late. \n\nA note as a woman, but the subway systems can be a culture shock. I do not recommend taking the subway alone late hours. During the daytime, there are not many people who ride in off-peak hours. I agree with the commenter below that Philly is not a flashy city- it would be wise to dress down.",

Those get very sketchy. Also if you\u2019re looking to get into greek life, I\u2019d personal stick with Theta Chai, Sig Ep, or any the sororities. The rest of the frats have a fairly bad history (check out @DrexelMeToo on insta for more). But yeah like everyone else said, stay on campus, east of drexel/lancaster is not that bad, stay away from north of drexel once it hits nightfall. But overall crime has gone way down in just the past year and a half i\u2019ve been here. It went from 7/11 getting mugged every other day to hardly getting any saftey alerts",

I would say that as long as you stay in University City you probably will be fine.",

    "postText": "I forwarded this message to my residents but I figured it\u2019d be pretty helpful to share to others! Let me know if you have any questions about move out and I\u2019ll try to get back faster than housing.\n\n\n1) **MOST IMPORTANT: YOU MUST BE GONE BY SATURDAY, JUNE 17TH @ 12PM** (unless you are doing the STAR scholars program, or have a summer housing assignment)\n\r\n-\tThis *does not mean* you are turning in your keys and checking out at 11:59. This does not mean you are still packing your boxes and loading them into your car at 11:59. This means everything should be done - your presence is not traceable in the dorm when the clock hits 12:00 noon. \n\r\n-\t*My advice:* leave as soon as your finals are done to avoid the last-minute rush on Saturday. For my procrastinators, pretend the deadline to be moved out (as in packed up, left the building) is 10:30 instead of 12. If you want to avoid Saturday traffic, pack everything up Friday night and leave before 8am on Saturday morning.\n\r\n-\tFor my international students: unless you have had prior accomodations made, this includes you too. Drexel does not make special exceptions if your flight leaves late on Saturday or Sunday, especially this late in the game. Our recommendation is to get a hotel room or stay with a friend if you need to stay somewhere after 12PM Saturday.\r\n\r\n2) **BEGIN PACKING NOW!** You can dedicate 10-20 minutes every day starting now beginning to break your room down and pack. I would start taking any wall decor/general decor down THIS WEEKEND and packing your non-essential items.\n-\tI\u2019ve seen way too many people stay overtime and get fined because they underestimated how much shit they have. Do not be that guy.\r\n\r\n3) **UTILIZE TOO GOOD TO GO!** Too Good to Go is a program taking place in every residence hall. You can leave any approved items (clothes, bedding, household goods, appliances) behind, and take what you want! Anything left behind will get donated. It's a great way to free yourself of any items you can't take back home with you.\r\n\r\n**Some FAQ:**\r\n\r\n**Q: What happens if I am here past 12PM on Saturday?**\n\r\nA: You will be fined. I am not certain what the cost is, but I heard some students who stayed late saturday/into sunday that got fined in the range of $400-600\r\n\r\n\n**Q: Why are you so strict about move out?**\n\r\nA: Drexel hosts conferences and programs in the residence halls over the summer. Once students move out, work begins to move new students in for summer term. You staying behind in the dorms holds this process back (think of a dorm as a giant, long-stay hotel)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Q: I'm in STAR Scholars/have a summer housing assignment. What do I do?**\n\r\nA: You should have recieved separate communication about your housing assignment. Your move out will likely be extended to Sunday if you are a STAR Scholar. Still pack diligently. \r\n\r\r\n**Q: Is there anything I should communicate to my parents?**\n\r\nA: Those \"No Stopping\" parking spots around the dorm are meant for parents to help with move out, so they can park there to assist with move out. Just no long-term parking, so don't park there and grab dinner. Also, don't be an asshole to desk staff :) Parents - come early, especially if you plan to move out Saturday or Friday Afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Q: I need to store stuff over the Summer. Where do I go?**\n\r\nA: Just google \"Drexel Summer Storage\" and a ton of options pop up. Maybe this site? https://storagesquad.com/schools/drexel-university-storage/\r\n\r\n\r\n**Q: I encountered an emergency and I need to stay in the dorm longer than my assigned time. Who do I contact?**\n\r\nA: Tell your RA and/or email housing@drexel.edu - there isn't likely much they can do, but it's worth a shot.\n\n\n**Some Move Out Etiquette**\n-\tdon\u2019t hog the move out carts\n-\tget any shit from the communal kitchen/communal area and take it\n-\tdon\u2019t leave trash in the halls, either put anything good in the too good to go area or put it in the trash.\n-\tcheck out with the front desk when you leave\r\n\n\nHope this helped anyone stressing about move out, lmk if you have any questions :)",

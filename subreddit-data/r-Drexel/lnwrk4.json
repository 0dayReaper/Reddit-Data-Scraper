A few things though:\n\n1) It\u2019s likely that if a breakout were to occur on campus and a threshold is reached for students infected that the University goes fully online and sends everyone home. \n\n2) Getting the vaccine and things going back to normal assumes that the vaccine\u2019s effects last longer than 6 months (which, they believe it will, but are not 100% sure)\n\n3) Things going back to normal assumes that the vaccines are effective against variants now and moving forward. \n\nBut by all means, skirt the rules because YOLO. Rather than waiting a few more months while we\u2019re in the home stretch, fuck it. Fuck the people who are immune suppressed that can\u2019t get the vaccines. Fuck the kids who are under a certain age that can\u2019t get the vaccine yet. You go and party.",

If you compare various states and countries there\u2019s no evidence lockdown or masks did anything yet it comes with a huge cost. Right now Florida has better numbers than California. Certainly with a such a drastic policy it would be clear it did something but it isn\u2019t.",

I wonder which country has a national lockdown with people actually obeying the rules, and which country doesn't?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso you still didn't understand my point. u/doMinationp was mocking you by sending an article that claim Sweden case didn't work and that people with asymptotic COVID had lung damage. But you agree with them by saying Hell yeah lol.",

That's great! \n\nGoing to a party mask-less and then go back to spread to other people? Not so much. \n\nUnless you can make a compelling argument on how partying is a necessity in this pandemic, I am all ears. \n\n**Noted**: I am completely fine with housemates who live together and party in the same house and don't meet anyone else. I am not okay with people who party and invite random people over then these people later go around and spread covid to people.",

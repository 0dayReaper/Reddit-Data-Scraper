            "comment": "I\u2019m a current game design major and I felt your pain when I was in my first year. I also hate 3D modeling and think it fucking sucks. Thankfully the amount you do does decrease over time. I think there\u2019s at least one more ANIM class where you\u2019ll certainly have to do some 3D modeling and animating. \n\nAs you start to specialize though you can start to take more classes based on your specific field of interest. When you get later in the program and you do more team projects there will usually be at least one other person that can handle that, or your team will stick to 2D projects. It all depends on what you wanna do though and best of luck on your finals!",

There are upperclassman lab assistants if you need help- they sent out a schedule for that earlier in the term. The SIGGRAPH server is also a really good resource for homework help. Best of luck!",

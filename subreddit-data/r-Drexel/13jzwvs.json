Idk if that\u2019s because it\u2019s an underground major that not a lot of ppl pursue or if it\u2019s THAT rigorous to the point that people struggle to pass.\n\nI\u2019m aware that Drexel runs on a quarter system so that could have an effect too.",

Without MSE there are no electronics, no smart phones, no computers. Steel is what spurred the industrial revolution, and that continues today with advanced materials for medical applications, energy generation and storage.\n\nOur students do not struggle to pass, in fact very few change out of the major, and on average have the highest GPA in the college. Most whoe transfer into MSE come from Chemical Engineering, because they believed (falsely) that ChemE is about Chemistry. In practice the MSE curriculum has more Chemistry than that of ChemE. \n\nMSE Graduates also command some of the highest starting salaries at the BS level. ChemE grads also have high salaries.",

The affluent neighborhoods of Center City don\u2019t have that and the commute in between would be covered by the Drexel shuttle.\n\nThis is all from my experience driving around Fitler square and walking through Rittenhouse, someone who actually lives there would be able to give better insight to trying to live as safe as possible.",

As we approach the summer quarter, we are looking for people who need summer quarter housing. Currently we have multiple seniors living in the house and as they graduate there will be room available for any Drexel student. Unfortunately, all of our other brothers already have leases for the summer or are freshamen and will be on summer break, so we are looking for at least 4 people to live in the house for the duration of the summer quarter.\n\nAdvantages in living in our house:\n\n* Free Washer and dryer in the house\n* Full industry kitchen\n* Quarter by quarter living meaning you are able to leave for fall quarter\n* All utilities are included\n* Counts as on-campus living, so current freshman and sophmores are allowed to move in\n* Is in a central spot of campus; across the street from Chick-fil-a\n\nAll rooms will be empty, cleaned, and come with:\n\n* Twin XL bed and bedframe\n* Two clothing dressers\n* A desk\n\nHousing cost is $947 a month, $2,840 a quarter. Utilities included\\*\\*\n\nIf you have any questions please email me at eam466@drexel.edu \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8dfrbkfoph0b1.jpg?width=6208&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ad2d831b2e05aa1a7250125b68081a0e60399015\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3t87f8foph0b1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1bc773629b7298231712a547f78a8305bf0c3abe\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qgf4g9foph0b1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=aae7ab289cbd9d6c36967900ef02e2d87ab428ff\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/phby49foph0b1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2156ed22a6360556e2b04016ea6ed44740b51bc4",

    "postText": "The females on this campus are out of control. The first time I ate lunch wearing my CCI shirt (with fully covered legs, mind you), I had literally 3 different women try to sit down and court me, like I would know how to talk to a girl. I quickly demonstrated superior knowledge of each of their niche interests, which apparently eliminates me from the dating pool (why shame me for being smart?).\n\nAnyway, that got them to leave but the problem has persisted in the past 3 months and I am so fed up with everybody wanting to get with me. I've taken to moving all the other chairs at tables I sit at to other tables, but yesterday a small Asian woman literally pulled up a chair and began ranting about the last DS exam. Girl, I don't struggle with DSs. I'm a CS major, not SE. After making it markedly clear that I did NOT in fact want to copulate in 3675 Market Street, she finally left me alone, but I wish these girls would stop worshipping me just because I am enrolled in the hardest program on campus (which was not difficult for me to get into, by the way).\n\nThe worst are when students from non-technical majors talk to me. We'll be having a nice, platonic conversation, when they inevitably ask the fateful question: \"What's your major?\" As soon as I say those two magnificent letters, I see their whole demeanor change. The doe eyes, the flushed cheeks, the jiggling cleavage. What makes an art major think they have a chance with me. Westphal and CCI are on whole different planes of existence. I'm not about to impregnate somebody that paints happy little trees for \"work.\"\n\nYou may think I'm just remarkably handsome, which I am, but my attractive acquaintances in ECE (they're not smart enough to be friends, but their childlike innocence is sometimes enviable), have literally no problems with this incessant harassment and courting from female creatures. Females see me as an object and a genius, when really I'm so much more: I'm top 100 in the world in Destiny 2. My gray shirt shouldn't reduce me to a bag of meat; if you want my heart, you have to grind with me, raid with me, join my clan, and most of all, watch Rick and Morty with me, and understand it -- no fake fans that shout \"pickle rick\" like its some kind of joke, when it's really the climax of the most tragic episode of season 3. Not that I cried.\n\nIf you want somebody for cheap sex, the ECE majors are right there (I don't blame you for avoiding SE though). Stop fetishizing my kind for something out of our control. I didn't want to be born a super genius. Hell, sometimes I wish I was an ECE major, moving through the world in ignorant bliss. But I have a responsibility now to save the world and create the next Facebook. Seductively touching your laptop with a Hello World program open isn't going to make me want to get with you. Come back in a Morty costume, code a Y combinator, or implement Djikstra's recursively, and then we'll talk.",

I apologize, on behalf of the \u201cgood ones\u201d (and yes, we exist), for this fool, who believes that his high IQ, which granted as a CS major\u2019s is approximately in the 99-PT (that\u2019s percentile for those humanities majors among you who haven\u2019t spelled it out yet) alone is enough to prosper, and allows it to eat him from the inside, like Prometheus. Like you, OP, I have interacted with several females of my own, and observed, that shunning them, placing such frigid words upon their beings, is quite counterproductive to their growth. Rather, educating them, allowing that perhaps a sliver of your knowledge might breach the dense, unrelenting cloud of pop culture references and Carty Bea raps, you may open them up to their full potential, perhaps, one day, even working for a company of yours or fathering your offspring. After all, is a smarter world not a place where people like us can be understood? Or should I not be saying that to someone who probably thinks his gifted prowess in Python brings him to the graduate level?\n\nAlso, just as a brief aside: I HAVE implemented Djikstra\u2019s recursively, I HAVE coded a Y combinator. And you\u2019ll never guess what misunderstood mad scientist I am cosplaying as, literally, as I type this post out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Also, my IQ is likely a standard deviation above yours, basically, statistically, it's just more likely, given my place on the curve...",

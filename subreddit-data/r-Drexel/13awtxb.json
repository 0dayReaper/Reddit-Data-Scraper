    "postText": "Hello everybody, I am a rising freshman who is ideally going to start early in the summer. I know this may seem unrealistic but it is highly likely that I will be approved to have my own dorm room without a roommate. I haven\u2019t done much research on where the best place to live as a freshman yet so I figured I would start here. Like I said it\u2019s very likely I will have my own room so please keep that in mind when commenting. Thank you in advance to anyone who leaves advice.",

I'd recommend researching either Chestnut Square (specifically the townhouse model) if you want something more comfortable and closer to campus or The Mason if you want something cheaper and more flexible with their lease timing. I never lived in campus dorms so not much I can say there but I'd be happy to try to answer any questions I can about ether place I mentioned.",

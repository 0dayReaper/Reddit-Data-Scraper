Personally, my experience has been alright so far (some maintenance issues but relatively quick resolution, no major pest infestations for me but apparently some of their buildings are worse than others).  \n\nOtherwise, you can check the sublet thread on here, look in some Drexel Facebook groups, or try your luck with smaller landlords on [apartments.com](https://apartments.com), zillow, etc",

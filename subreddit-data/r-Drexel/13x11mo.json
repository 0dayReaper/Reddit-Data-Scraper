    "postText": "I was hoping to get a software engineer coop at Comcast A round for fall/winter. However, I noticed that the vast majority of people I asked got an interview from them? Is Comcast usually this competitive, and is it a hard coop to get? Did a lot of people get a Comcast interview this quarter? I scheduled my Comcast interviews and they are all 30mins long. Has anyone who have done the interview before know how difficult it is? Is there coding and many difficult software questions?",

            "comment": "It depends on the position whether it\u2019s competitive or not. Software engineering is going to be competitive anywhere. I worked at Comcast and a lot of departments request a lot of Interviews because they risk losing the coop if they don\u2019t get enough interest. Comcast is def not an easy co op to get especially for software engineering. But typically the 30 min interview is preliminary and they are mainly trying to get a feel of the kind of person u are rather than judging ur technical skills first. If they think they can work with you then you get another interview (There is a good chance they questions your coding and software knowledge regarding the position)",

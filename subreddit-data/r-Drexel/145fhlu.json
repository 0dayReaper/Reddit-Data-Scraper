    "postText": "I\u2019m looking for a part time on campus job (preferably something like a job at the library) but can\u2019t seem to find much on the student employment page. Sadly, there doesn\u2019t seem to be many options and I don\u2019t meet several of the qualifications because I am a first year. I also don\u2019t think I qualify for federal work-study, but am open to working a job near campus. I just don\u2019t know how much of a hassle that would be since I have to leave campus. Is it mostly too early to apply now? Any advice?",

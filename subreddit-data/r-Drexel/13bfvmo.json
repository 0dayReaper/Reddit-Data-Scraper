    "postText": "Hi! As a CS major, I am required to complete 6 credits (or 2 classes) which have a Writing Intensive (WI) component. I don't really understand what this means, and how its different from first year writing classes we take at Drexel. DegreeWorks says that I need to have these two classes in COM/WRIT/ENGL/SCRP. For those who have taken these, what its like? If available in an online section, can we manage the workload during coops?",

            "comment": "Per the Drexel website: \u201cWriting Intensive Courses require a substantial writing element. For a course to be certified as [WI], writing must amount to a substantial part of the coursework and grade.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m a double major, and one of my majors is English writing (so I\u2019ve taken more [WI] courses than I can count). Some require hundreds of pages of writing throughout the quarter, and others require less, but all put a major weight/emphasis on the writing component. If you\u2019re a CS major, I would recommend WRIT 225 (I took this with several CS majors who genuinely enjoyed it, and it\u2019s not too much work) or if you\u2019re interested in game design, take the intro to SCRP track in which you\u2019ll learn how to construct a compelling visual narrative. \n\nIf you struggle with writing, as many STEM focused people often do, make frequent visits to the Drexel writing center. They exist to help you refine your ability to write, and to help you succeed in [WI] courses here at Drexel.",

I would go to catalog.drexel.edu and look at your major's degree requirements. If any of the classes qualify as WI, they will have a WI written after the course nunber (e. g. BIO 219 WI). If you are considering or have a minor do the same with the minor's degree requirements. That way you get a WI courss that fullfills another requirement. \n\nAs far as how are they different than other English classes, they are writing intnsive. Thay actually mean that. I jad to write a lot and ot was all group work. One term we wrote a google doc that was 30+ pages. It's a lot more wriring than your standard Englsh course.",

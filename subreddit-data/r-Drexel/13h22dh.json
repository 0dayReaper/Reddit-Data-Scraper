    "postText": "Hi. I'm planning on attending Drexel this fall as a freshman, and I was wondering from the dorms listed below, which one based on your own experiences is a good place to be? Which has a good community? Which has nice bathrooms? Stuff like that to answer would be great.\n\nRight now, here are my top picks for dorms: \n\n\\- Towers Hall\n\n\\- Millennium Hall\u00a0\n\n\\- Kelly Hall\n\n\\- Bentley Hall\n\nI'm prioritizing money, and I know Tower's Hall has the lowest cost, but the remaining dorms are $200 more. Is it worth that $200 extra?\n\nRight now, I'm thinking Bentley Hall, but please please let me know what you guys think.\n\nThank you!",

It\u2019s the quintessential college dorm experience and there\u2019s no reason to fork over $2k more for any of the others.",

I recommend Bentley; while still a traditional building with shared rooms and communal bathrooms, it has been updated with more reliable appliances (such as laundry) and it has nice study spaces, as well as 2 private bathroom stalls on each floor. If you're looking for a standard dorm situation, Bentley is great for a traditional \"first-year\" experience with pretty big rooms (albeit not as large as the towers rooms) and a nice atmosphere. Kelly Hall, with its most recent renovation, is surprisingly nice inside and comparable to Bentley in terms of upscale traditional dorm living. However, if you live on the wrong side of Kelly, you will never rid your room of the smell of canola oil and french fries from the chick-fil-a directly below you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, the quality of your living situation depends more on your roommate than your room. Live with someone who is clean, hygienic, and cares about the living space, and you will be far better off than many others living in the dorms. In other words... don't settle for a roommate, be picky.",

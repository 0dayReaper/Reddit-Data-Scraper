Pros are that we have the highest gear to student ratio in the country, really well funded facilities, and mostly terrific instructors. Cons are that the equipment room managers (Bill and Jamie) are complete assholes and will try to swindle you or gate-keep the equipment at every turn. The department has no windows and sometimes smells weird, but overall I recommend if you are strong willed, ambitious, and social enough to be able to work alongside peers on almost everything. I\u2019m a sophomore at 20, and I know a couple of first years who are 21 and 23 y/o, so you\u2019re not going to be singled out for being older. We collaborate with students of all ages and don\u2019t really identify ourselves by seniority in most cases. The best co-ops are amazing opportunities but very selective, so be sure to put the work in during your first two years to boost your resume. I know Drexel has a winter entry program but I don\u2019t know how it works or if film students are eligible. Never got to do Drexel in LA because I\u2019m a double major and my plan of study doesn\u2019t have room for it. PM if you have more questions.",

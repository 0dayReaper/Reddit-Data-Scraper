    "postText": "I am taking two very difficult core classes next quarter, and I am trying to find some light classes that are really easy and don't have a huge workload. I am already register for phys 131 but I have the chance to take phys 151 too and finish my required science elective. Should I do it? Phys 151 has a lab and I don't think I want to take anything else too difficult. How is the class? Is the workload, hw, and tests easy to do with minimal effort? Both classes are online and with Eric d scheidly",

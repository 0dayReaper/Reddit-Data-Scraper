That being said, you can expect it to go pretty long and I would definitely recommend that you eat before hand! edit: Eat before hand because by the time the commencement ceremony... commences... most places will be closed or soon to close.",

I\u2019m in the Wesphal commencement which starts that same day at 12:30. I\u2019m really on the fence about going to both and having to rush between them and spend 8 hours sitting watching speeches in one day.",

That being said you can leave early. No one forces you to stay. You can just do the walk on the field and then leave to go do something with your family. All it really is is speeches and honorary phds to people.",

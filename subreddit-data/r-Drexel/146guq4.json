I used the study guide to plan out what I was going to study. \n\nFor things like naming and drawing, it\u2019s pure memorization so keep testing yourself by using flashcards and keep drawing the structures until you are confident with it. Try to come up with silly mnemonics to memorize. \n\nFor conceptual questions, you can sometimes guess which laws or info will come up based on how often it is mentioned in the lecture/slides. I usually had a separate sheet for those that I carried around to read over and over to get familiar with it. \n\nAlso try to utilize your recitation papers. I would study a topic and use the recitation homeworks as practice. Do them without any help and then grade your paper so you know what to focus on. Good luck on your final!",

If you can get to 100% understanding of those you will succeed on the final exam. \n\nBasically go through them one time and as you take them write your own explanations for what the answer is (try them on your own but when you do this you can also look at answer guides as long as you are coming up with your own explanations).",

I also don\u2019t think I value such celebrations and I believe that acheiving that degree already is a milestone.",

It's a once in a lifetime opportunity that you might also end up regretting if you don't attend.",

Friends didn't go, and regretted it later.\n\nBonus story I got my MS years later (at a different local university that did graduation much better).  By this time I was married with small kids.  My wife convinced me to go to that graduation even though it was going to be a hassle.  It is one of my great life memories to have my kids there with me for that.",

The robes are uncomfortable, it's hot and humid out, you have to wait for so long to get your degree, you spend ten seconds walking up to a stage and shaking the hands of people who hadn't heard of you till your name got called then sit down and wait for everyone else to do the same thing, and of course you don't know most of the other people getting their degrees\n\nI'm not a huge photos guy either and I didn't have the best relationship with my family at the time, so to be honest the whole ordeal sounded pretty lonely and sad to me. I had a better time just going out to a nice park and chilling out, finally feeling free after spending six and a half long years completing my five-year degree\n\nAll that said, though, I think you might actually want to at least go to your college/department graduation. You know more of the people, it takes less time, and your professors and classmates are there to celebrate with you. As someone who didn't go to graduation and who also isn't really a fan of those sorts of celebrations, I think the nice part of graduation is being a part of celebrating all the other people graduating alongside you, and feeling that last bit of connection as you all go your separate ways. I think it's nice for your teachers and your family, too, if you've built good relationships there. And as much as I dislike photos, it's nice to have one or two hanging around for these sorts of things",

Be mindful of what you get as hot food is only good for a limited time and they can't really \"prep\" a lot other types of food to eat later. Not saying hot food is bad, but having some food stashed for later can be nice.\n\nIf you dont want to, just say you only carry card, only have digital wallet, or you've only got enough cash for whatever youre going to buy.

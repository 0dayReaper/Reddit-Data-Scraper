One of my hybrid classes has a location on Ucity but the other one doesn't have a location specified so I'm very confused.",

The last time I had a hybrid class, I had the first class of the week in person and then a bunch of stuff to do online on my own in place of a second class. Some hybrid classes might not meet in person every week, but that\u2019s probably up to the professor. Sometimes they don\u2019t find out the actual room number until later, but if it specifies university city campus and a time/day (and doesn\u2019t say something like remote synchronous) then you def have it in person",

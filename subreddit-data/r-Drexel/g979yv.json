I've just been struggling so hard to find the motivation to actually do them. And to make things worse, I'm working on a research project with my professor, and we were supposed to zoom meet last week to talk about my progress, but I had to tell them that I didn't do anything last week at all because I just couldn't.

Students like me who just came back from coop will have spent 1.5 years away from campus life before things will feel even close to normal again. I can't tell yet if summer term itself is going to be worse or better. Hopefully when it's warmer and I can find some old friends to hang out with things will feel better. \n\nThis whole situation sucks. I keep telling myself that as students we are at least lucky that we can still move forward with our 'job' unlike people who are stuck away from work and financially suffering, but it doesn't make anything about this situation feel better.",

Regarding aid, they're referring to aid or scholarships that are dependent on your GPA remaining above a certain level for the semester. Just like we're going to have to deal with the mess of \"pass/fail\" for transfers after all of this is over for years to come, these scholarships are going to have to figure out a way to deal with pass/fails as well.\n\nAgain. Consult a financial aid specialist at Drexel if you have questions about all of this. They can explain it in greater detail and go over with you IF and HOW it'll effect your individual aid. Don't just blanket say that pass/fail is bad. Seek advice from your advisor. It's what they're there for.",

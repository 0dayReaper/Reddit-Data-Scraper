    "postText": "Hi guys\n\nMy co-op is so not what was advertised on the steinbreight system. This is my boss\u2019s first time using the drexel co op system, and she failed to mention a lot of what the job entails. The role was for a project manager but I\u2019m more like her personal assistant, and rather a \u201ccooperative education\u201d experience where I learn on the job, she just throws work my way and expects it to get done and gets annoyed if I ask questions or am making mistakes because I was poorly trained. \n\nI spend my whole day being lectured for hours when I\u2019m really trying to do my best, I work so many hours overtime unpaid (it\u2019s a paid position) to meet expectations, and I\u2019m just not getting any positive feedback. It\u2019s not even constructive criticism she just berates me and is condescending. I feel like I\u2019m not learning how to improve. \n\nThis is my first co op and I explained that when interviewing, so she knows I\u2019m not highly experienced, yet gets mad when I\u2019m not able to perform the skill set of an employee who\u2019s been in the industry for years. \n\nAdvertised as a paid co op but I haven\u2019t been paid since the end of April, she didn\u2019t even set up a payroll system yet.\n\nI\u2019m just so frustrated and don\u2019t know what to do, any advice? Is there a way to cut your co op short or pick up another co op role?\n\nAny advice appreciated",

Nothing is expected if it isn\u2019t addressed beforehand that you aren\u2019t getting paid on time. You are working for free at that point. What you are describing in terms of work is not characteristic of the co-op position for Drexel students.",

            "comment": "~~I won\u2019t touch on the co-op aspect because others already have.~~ Because no one has explicitly said it, email your advisor saying \u201cThe position is not as described in SCDC and job offer.\u201d Your advisor should immediately respond with a template asking you to describe it etc. It\u2019s a formal process that will eventually get the employer kicked out of co-op program if it happens enough time. \n\nHowever, regarding unpaid overtime, you cannot legally work any amount of time at an hourly position without being compensated for it. Especially overtime at a minimum of 1.5x, I can\u2019t imagine a project management position is exempt.\n\nGet something in writing stating you worked (overtime) hours without getting paid, whether that be your time sheet with &gt;40 hours and your pay stub showing 40, start an email chain with your boss and HR/accounting asking about the hours you\u2019ve put in and why you haven\u2019t been paid for them, etc. Submit this in a report to the Department of Labor. \n\nFor now, stop caring. Turn your brain off when you\u2019re getting lectured and don\u2019t work a minute over 40 hours. You\u2019re a co-op, not an experienced PM or personal assistant. If that\u2019s what they wanted then they could\u2019ve forked over the extra cash to hire one. Having a shitty personality isn\u2019t enough to report to your co-op advisor but it doesn\u2019t mean it deserves any worth.",

My second co op tried to get me to work over time so I kindly reminded them that I cannot. Good luck with your boss they sound like a jerk lol.",

It is where u are trained and eventually made to be somewhat independent in what u do. Overtime thing is fine if u were paid, but since u r not, it's a major red flag. If she's guilt tripping u and making u feel like a loser, she has the whole idea of a Co op wrong, they're supposed to know ur just an intern and it's their job to teach u, it's the whole point of an internship.",

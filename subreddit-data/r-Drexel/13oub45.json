I dropped my resume and never heard anything back. I feel like it's just basically knowing about the company and their internship program n all.\n\nThen if you like the company... you can later visit their website and apply. Bdw some company's give to code to apply though! Which is nice!",

Be yourself and ask questions about the company as well as show your strengths and knowledge. Make sure that you speak for almost the same length of time as the business rep or less. Ask questions that can decipher whether the company is one you are interested and represent yourself well enough for the business rep to make a judgement on whether you are a god fit for the company. If you know who\u2019s going to be there ahead of time, look up the companies and most importantly know each business mission statement and go from there and bring a notebook to take notes on each company rep you speak with. Always ask them if they have a business card for your reference. Never be scared to reach out for more info if you didn\u2019t get enough info the first time.",

A bike + pedestrian collision is infinitely less fatal than a bike + car collision. That's not to say any collision is ideal, but there are bike racks in the middle of Lancaster Walk for the DAC, there are Indego stations all around Philadelphia in the middle of sidewalks. Everyone's just trying to get where they're going safely. As long as people are being respectful of space, I'd say it's really not a huge deal.",

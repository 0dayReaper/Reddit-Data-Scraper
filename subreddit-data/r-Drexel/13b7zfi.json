Is taking three economics classes at the same time too much?\n\nAre there any Econ courses that should not be taken together? Are any particularly super time consuming for any reason?",

The syllabus doesn\u2019t always accurately assess the feel of the workload\n\nEdit: Wouldn\u2019t be on here seeking insight from fellow students if that wasn\u2019t exactly what I was looking for hahaha",

It\u2019s just about collecting more Data points to make a more informed decision for myself.\n\nAt the end of the day it\u2019s all relative. But we are humans, and I like hearing other\u2019s experiences and learning from it. I can distinguish between what useful for me and what won\u2019t be. I trust others can do the same.\n\nPlus this is a forum. I haven\u2019t found much info about anything Econ related on this subreddit. It\u2019s nice to hear what other student have to say about their academics. We\u2019re all in this together",

It heavily depends on the major. Try speaking to the people you're friendly with in your major, or going to your majors study resources and talking to upperclassmen there.",

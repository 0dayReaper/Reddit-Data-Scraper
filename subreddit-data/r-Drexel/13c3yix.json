            "comment": "I did VIP for three Terms. I think it really depends on what faculty members you work with and your experience level. I did one term as a freshman and then two as a sophomore, all with Dr. Lu who researches wireless power transfer and other similar applications. It was a really cool opportunity and the first term I did as a sophomore I was helping in the lab probably once or twice a week. The Phd student I worked with was very helpful in explaining the concepts on a broader level for me to understand and he was very thankful to have my help. \n\nSometimes you can have the opportunity to be published in research articles depending on your involvement and knowledge. I was supposed to have been included as a contributor but I don't think the article was ever finalized so that kinda sucked lol. \n\nOverall it can be a great experience and it counts as a 1 credit course so that is nice as well. Also a great resume builder and is something you can talk about during co-op interviews as well. A lot of my employers I interviewed with really liked hearing about my involvement in the program.  \n\nI definitely recommend if there is a research topic you interested in!",

If I don't get this course, then I will delay graduation by one year(because this course is a prerequisite for another course, and the course only offer in the Fall quarter\n\nShould I simply do one coop and graduate, or risk delaying graduation by doing two coops.\n\nI am a junior CS student.",

Co-ops are super nice to have though.  Depending on your timeline, you could try asking your advisor if they'd let you take SE-310 at the same time as your first quarter of senior design.  You could also consider if you'd get value out of an extra year if you do go for the second co-op and fail to get in SE-310; maybe you could go for a minor or two?\n\nBut yeah, like the other commenters, personally I wouldn't risk it",

In that case, assuming your co-op cycle is spring-summer, your best hope might be asking your advisor to let you take SE-181 and SE-310 simultaneously.  I know people have done this at some point in the past, but that might've been a different special circumstance or requirements may have changed.  Worth a shot though, especially if they still won't override you during co-op.  Both classes deal with Java programming; SE-181 is supposed to introduce it for you to use in SE-310, but I think you could make it work",

In that case, assuming your co-op cycle is spring-summer, your best hope might be asking your advisor to let you take SE-181 and SE-310 simultaneously.  I know people have done this at some point in the past, but that might've been a different special circumstance or requirements may have changed.  Worth a shot though, especially if they still won't override you during co-op.

If it doesn't work, then I will talk about taking those two courses at the same time. However, I have asked my advisor if I can take two classes at the same time and one is a prerequisite for another. They said they will not approve the plan which did not satisfy the prerequisites.",

Every time I'm on co-op, my advisor just overrides me into the course I need to be in to graduate. That's what they're required to do by the university. If your advisor isn't guaranteeing timely graduation via override, they're just not doing their job. Take the second co-op dude!",

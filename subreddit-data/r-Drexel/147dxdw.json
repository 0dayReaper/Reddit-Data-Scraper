I was wondering how much would taking a three credit course cost me if I decided to take it over the summer online compared to when I take it on the fall during my co-op. pls answer before the blackout in 20 minutes\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I heard from seniors that it only costs $800 if you want to take 4 credit classes without any additional charge except for being registered as a Drexel student for $800 during co-op. I saw online that it says $1342 per credit hour and I think that might be a bit much for a 3 credit class since itll be around 4k for one class which is more than what I pay for for one quarter with 20 credits.  I was just asking to make sure I was not wrong with this info",

It is worth talking to your advisor about this if you haven't already.  I would look into doing it at a community college and transferring it in. Cheaper that way. DCCC is decent if you are local to drexel",

A weird situation, but possible, \n\nYou also do not qualify as a claimable dependent according to the IRS if you make over $4,200 USD of reported taxable income. Again, weird if someone claimed you while you are technically ineligible.\n\nThose over 24 should be totally fine, unless someone claimed them while they are ineligible to be claimed. It would force and audit to determine that, however.\n\nI think many student citizens who have worked a co-op and made over $4,200 in the last year's taxes they filed should technically be okay. However, that is not say that the IRS will not come out with further guidance, or people are claimed as dependents when technically ineligible.",

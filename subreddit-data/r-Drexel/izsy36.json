Can\u2019t find the exact sources of the rest but it was funded in a joint effort between Drexel, the state, and the city. Drexel has a legacy of squash and certainly is getting most of the funding for this from donors. But I\u2019ll have to double check that. \n\nApparently the new courts are projected to create 90 permanent jobs and $23 million in annual economic activity for Philadelphia. And the redevelopment of other athletic spaces on campus (33rd and arch bubble, vidas complex) will benefit the 2/3 of the student body that utilizes those spaces. So of what portion Drexel is actually paying from its own pockets, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too excessive",

Do you consider the financial strain that the pandemic has put on almost every family of Drexel students when making your calculations? \n\nMost of the complaints coming from students are based on the simple fact that we have been paying for resources which we haven't used during the pandemic. We don't have access to campus buildings, libraries, and other vital resources for university students. Yet we pay for every single resource like it was fully functional. Idk what the expenses are for maintaining infrastructure (although probably significantly lower than during regular times), but it makes no sense that students should pay for it. I will not even go into the quality of education, as Drexel courses have turned into open source courses that some professor just randomly uploads on Youtube",

Like I said, they\u2019re losing *millions* without room and board/dining, thats a major hit. I think Drexel\u2019s staffing is pretty bloated and they could probably cut a lot of positions, but I digress",

Universities should charge students based on the resources they access and the quality of their education, or put more effort in offering the complete Drexel education for which we continue to pay. There are a few departments who are dealing horribly with online teaching despite having 2 academic terms to prepare, as they offered almost no courses during Spring/Summer. Just because lowering tuition would put Drexel in an unfavorable financial situation, it doesn't mean that it isn't the right thing to do.",

I don't remember any kind of LAN like that, so I'm assuming that's from before anyone on the current E-board was enrolled at Drexel. Now, at all our LANs we provide top of the line gaming PCs for students to play on. And, we also let anyone bring any kind of console they want, and provide TONS of room to do so. If you have any questions about how the club is currently run or any suggestions our DMs are open!",

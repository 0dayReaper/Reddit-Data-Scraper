I\u2019m studying on the main campus, but I\u2019ve taken a few classes only offered at the PC location and the quality of the classes doesn\u2019t change. \nIf Panama City isn\u2019t where you want to be and Tallahassee was your main choice, you could do TCC to FSU pathways. It\u2019s a solid option and TCC rocks so i would consider it.",

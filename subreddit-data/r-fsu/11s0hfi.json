    "postText": "Flights into TLH are eye-watering. JAX a bit more reasonable, but how does a student get from JAX to campus? Groome, shuttle service that handles several other unis, isn't an option here. I saw Greyhound bus but it showed 1 trip daily and it was 8am-ish. Tally making it hard to get to! Any help appreciated.",

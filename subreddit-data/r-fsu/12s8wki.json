    "postText": "Sorry for bringing this topic back up but I am kinda on a last leg here. Im currently living in Traditions and the lack of AC control in the dorms is causing the temperature in here to stay uncomfortably high due to the outside temperature (known issue). Im losing sleep because of it, sweating really bad and all that, a colder sleep environment is super important to me. (my body might just be one of those that gets warm easily.. idk)\n\nWas wondering if there are any suggestions to bring the temp of my room down, especially during the coming summer months.\n\nI already: \n\n\\-Have a fan going 24/7\n\n\\-Open window on colder nights\n\n\\-Keep heat-producing items to a minimum",

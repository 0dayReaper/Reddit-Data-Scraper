    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman looking to major in Environmental Science/Policy. I have all of my math credits and the bio 1 credit, but still need to take the following prerequisites: CHM1045 General Chemistry I and CHM1045 Lab, GLY 2010C Physical Geology with Lab, and BSC2011 Biological Science II and BSC2011 Lab. I don't enjoy chemistry (although I have prior experience with AP Chemistry), so my first choice would be to go ahead and start with bio 2. Is there a specific/recommended order that I have to take these classes in? Teacher recommendations also greatly appreciated, as I am picking classes soon!",

            "comment": "The most basic way to find a recommended course sequence is to look at the program's academic map. Here's the map for the ESP major: [http://undergrad1.its.fsu.edu/academic\\_guide/map-display.php?program=environmental-science-and-policy](http://undergrad1.its.fsu.edu/academic_guide/map-display.php?program=environmental-science-and-policy)\n\nCHM1045+Lab is their recommended starting science, but they don't **require** it (seen in the righthand \"Milestones\" column) until the third semester. So you can take Bio 2+Lab your first semester if you can get seats, Chem 1+Lab your second semester, and be ahead with the entire science sequence for the major.",

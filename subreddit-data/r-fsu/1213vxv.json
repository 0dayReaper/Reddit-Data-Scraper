    "postText": "Does anyone know what exactly the difference between the personal hardship and the mental health course drops are. I am really struggling right now and  I don't want to apply for one and then have it be rejected only to not be able to apply for the other, I think that would be the breaking point for me. I think the personal hardship one might be the best fit but I really need an option that will not require me to pay back my scholarship money. The website says that sometimes they do and sometimes they don't refund the money for that option and I was wondering if anybody has gone through the process and wouldn't mind sharing? Thanks.",

Mental health is for mental health.\n\nI got a personal hardship withdrawal when my mother got cancer and I had to move home to care for her. That is what a personal hardship withdrawal is for.\n\nMental health and medical withdrawals are essentially rolled into one, and they are for if your own personal health is why you have to drop.\n\n\nEither way, you need to contact case management ASAP and not get advice from people on reddit who could seriously lead you astray. Case management is awesome and they will help you out with all your questions.\n\nhttps://dsst.fsu.edu/cms",

            "comment": "Either way, the drop requires supporting documentation.\n\nMental health - or medical - drops require specific types of documentation from state licensed providers that you were or are getting treatment from during the semester in question.\n\nPersonal hardship covers a variety of circumstances, but still requires documentation. Depending on circumstances and office like case management may be able to write a letter of support, but it is not guaranteed.\n\nIf approved, the biggest difference in the type of drops is tuition refund. Drops approved through the medical or mental health processes come with a tuition refund. Personal hardship drops do not accept in specific circumstances, such as death of an immediate family member.\n\nThe first step in initiating any drop process is to contact your academic deans office. Any office like case management can explain options to you, but they still have to refer you to your Dean's office because that's who you have to initiate any process with, and they'll explain the same process to you either way.",

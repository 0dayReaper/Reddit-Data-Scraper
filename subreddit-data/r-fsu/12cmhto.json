Has anyone participated in the program? Did it help you adjust to the school? Was it worth it? Does it take away from any experiences at the school?",

            "comment": "I'm a first year in the program &amp; there's nothing much to it so far. The only requirements to keep the scholarship (or stay in the Program) is to take their Engage100 course in the Fall, do a check-in with them each semester, complete 15 credit hours each semester, and attend an event (TakeCARE Initiative) each semester. (By \"each semester\" I just mean Fall and Spring semesters, no summer) It doesn't take away from your college experience at all. I wouldn't say it helped me adjust to the school, but I connected well with the people in my Engage100 &amp; they host fun events that help you meet other people in the program. I'd say it's worth it for the extra money and resources. It definitely isn't a burden, but it keeps me on track with the 15 credit/semester guideline. I'd say that would be the most difficult part.",

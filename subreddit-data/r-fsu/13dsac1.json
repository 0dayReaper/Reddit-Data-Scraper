    "postText": "Stuck in Tallahassee over the summer and looking for something fun to do?? Join us for Survivor FSU\u2019s Mini Game: Paradise Park. One Day, 10 Contestants, One Sole Survivor.\n\nOpen to FSU Students, Alumni, and non-students living close to campus(or anywhere!). You may sign up to play with friends BUT you will be separated onto different starting tribes for fairness!! Location is Tom Brown Park and tentative start time is 9 am (expect to be there majority of the day). Survivor FSU is becoming a club and is looking for people to play in this mini game as well as future games, or simply just join the club!! \n\nSee you there :)\n\nSign Up: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqAvqHRpcIaq-Csnx0VeCdarJPkLtLbMNi0MJy862nZDP_sw/viewform\nInstagram for Updates: @SurvivorFSU\nLinktree: linktr.ee/survivorfsu",

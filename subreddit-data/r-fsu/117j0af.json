    "postText": "I got into the FSU honors program so I know I\u2019ll be able to live at Landis if I commit. I was watching a YouTube video on FSU housing where the guy mentioned Landis has singles and doubles, and that got me excited because although I\u2019m fine rooming with someone, I\u2019d love a single. If anyone knows the odds of me getting a single as a first-time undergrad student, or how I can increase these odds, I\u2019d appreciate any info.\n\nEdit: it looks like they\u2019re very rare but I\u2019ll sign up for a spot in the housing queue as soon as I can on 2/23, if I don\u2019t get one that\u2019s fine and I\u2019m still happy living at Landis",

I think my number was like 127 when I was a freshman and there were singles available, but I chose to live in Gilchrist because there was a single attached to another single instead of to a room with more people.",

Apparently last year there were a lot of honors admits and some of them didn't even end up in Gilchrist, but scattered in other dorms. From what I've heard about dorms for returning students already this year, I wouldn't be surprised if the incoming class experiences a repeat of last year.",

Im reasonably certain dorms are allotted first to RAs then to people with qualifying medical reasons, which means the odds of a random person being assigned a single room would be closer in isolation to (number of singles - pre-allocated singles) / number of general people applying for rooms. But its not even in isolation as people who might not otherwise live in a dorm building might be assigned a room there if they qualified for a single and the dorm they would otherwise live in didnt have a single. So the odds of a general person getting a single in Landis by random assignment are nowhere near 7%\n\nYou deleted your response to the OP where I was going to reply so ill leave this here instead",

The system used to be a simple priority number that was generated based on the order in which housing received your application.  Though it still sounds beneficial to send in an early application to get as good a number as possible.  Graduate students, returning students, and national merit scholars also usually get priority as well.  Though graduate students mostly are going to be placed at McCollum, Ragans, or Traditions halls.  Returning students mostly would be placed at the same halls, though Landis and Gilchrist will have some slots as well.  National merit scholars who are first year students will usually have first choice of housing and will probably have the best shot of a single in Landis or Gilchrist.",

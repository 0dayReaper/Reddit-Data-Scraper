But I\u2019m still early into my finance classes since I\u2019m a double major. \n\nRight now, I\u2019m mostly taking general breath business classes.\n\nSo any insight? Thanks!",

These classes can be tricky but also have material that is relevant for high finance career interviews and should not be half assed.",

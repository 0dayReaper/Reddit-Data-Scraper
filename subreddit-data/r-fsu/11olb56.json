The on-campus CS department at Tallahassee is the \u201cactual\u201d CS degree offered by FSU (i.e. the default if you go to FSU as a CS major) and as an on-campus student you are in fact not supposed to take any CS classes online. Ive never entirely understood the stark divide between the two, its just something at least Tallahassee\u2019s CS department is very adamant about.",

I would recommend it if you are an out of state student b/c they offer their CS classes at a reduced rate if you switch to that campus. If not, you can do your classes on campus in Tallahassee. Not sure if they allow you to take PC online classes while still being a Tally campus student tho.",

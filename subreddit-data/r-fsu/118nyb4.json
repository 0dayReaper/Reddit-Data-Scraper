    "postText": "(Forewarning: this post is a long \u2018un) I\u2019m 23 years old, and have never had a girlfriend. I have spent way too much time dwelling on the reasons for this, but this is what I have concluded. My whole life, I have been extremely introverted. I always kept to myself, never approached anybody I found attractive, always lacked confidence. It never worries me back then, I assumed that it would just *happen* without me even trying. After graduation, I completed my AA mostly online, so I didn\u2019t really get the chance to meet anybody or make new friends, so when I transferred to FSU, I was ready to finally meet more people, and hopefully enter a relationship.\n\nBut the latter didn\u2019t happen. And it bothered me to no end.\n\nTo increase my chances, I downloaded both tinder and bumble, and would max out my free swipes every day hoping to find someone. \n\nNo luck. All my matches ghosted me. \n\nSenior year rolls around. I joined a club, to boost my odds even more. Had fun, met some cool people, but never dated. At this point, I\u2019m seriously worried. Before I proceed, I want to make some things clear. I am not making this post for pity or attention. I am not looking for a hookup. All I want to know is this: how common is my predicament? Is there anyone here that can relate to me? And for the more socially adept among us, do you think I\u2019m going about this the wrong way? \n\nFrom my anecdotal perspective, it seems like everyone I know manages to find somebody. Part of me thinks that something is wrong with me, and I\u2019m destined to live alone forever. I really don\u2019t want to accept that as true.\n\nTo ask a bunch of random strangers online for help was the last thing I wanted to do, but I really am at my wits end here. I am fortunate enough to have a few really good friends, some from high school, others from work or college. But I crave partnership. I just want to know what it\u2019s like.",

I think you\u2019re taking all the right steps besides dating apps -there\u2019s no genuine partnership anywhere on those apps- keep putting yourself out there. You mention not being confident and I think that\u2019s one thing you should focus on improving. You don\u2019t have to be arrogant or boastful, but be confident in something you know you\u2019re good at. Fake it till you make it if you must. If you have a passion, share it, nothing is more attractive then a deep personal passion. Having more confidence will definitely help you but don\u2019t be afraid to approach the people you think are attractive, unfortunately we live in a society that expects men to initiate contact. Good luck!",

            "comment": "Joining a club, or an extra curricular activity isn't enough. You need to point blank ask someone \"hey, would you like to grab lunch together sometime?\" .  You dont even need to call it a date. Bonus points if you're asking this during a club or activity which coincidentally happens to be around lunch time anyways. It'll transition easily and just keep doing that until you find someone who actually enjoys spending time with you. Then you progress to ask them out to other things (movies, Netflix, dinner?, Some other activity). Until you eventually are just in the habit of spending time with each other. Avoid getting friend zoned by letting her know your intentions after the first couple times y'all met.\n\nWhat might hold you back from doing this is the fear of rejection.\n\n\nBut here's the thing that can help you get rid of that fear of rejection, which is the thought that \"I'll never see this person again if i don't try\", so you literally have nothing to lose.\n\n\nBest of luck",

I too have had a really difficult time making friends at FSU; the only friend I do have graduated last year. Even after joining clubs and getting people's numbers it never really goes anywhere (friendship wise). Even dating around just to meet people just is really difficult.\n\nWith that said, Tallahassee dating app scene is atrocious, I can guarantee you won't find anything genuine there. I do believe that there is someone for everyone, and you just haven't found the right person yet. The only thing I can really suggest is putting yourself out there more I suppose. Like someone else said, ask someone to hang out directly (doesnt have to be a date).",

I met a lot more people willing to hang out while in the military than in college, due to the age difference. That being said, my closest friends are from college at the moment. I keep up with the handful of guys that I made friends with much more than the military guys. That's because I made an effort to stick out those friendships. \n\nYou have a degree, you did some clubs, you know what it takes to stick your neck out. Might I suggest looking into joining the military as an officer? You'll go through OCS/OCT with a group with the same experience at the same time. You'll have the opportunity to keep up with them through your career. Life long friends. Because y'all know what it's like to try to make friends in college. It's tough, so you'll sick together.\n\nI know it's not the same as a relationship that you're asking about, but work on that self confidence, make close friends to begin with, relationships will happen. I met my girlfriend of many years in a bar, out with my military buddies, in the snow, in Jersey, where none of us were from, including her. It just happens when you least expect it. But that confidence of having good friends, makes you a likely target to be talked to, instead of sitting in a corner feeling down. Not saying you do, but the first saying works, women like a confident man, but without being and asshole. You sounds like you're not and asshole, so just get confident. Going out with a wingman, is a good thing.",

I also hear you talking loudly to your friend sitting next to you, and that\u2019s quite distracting to me and your peers. I try to be interesting, and talk about our subject in a fun way. Maybe it\u2019s me? Something I do wrong? Or, if you don\u2019t want to be here, why attend? Just chill @ home and watch twitch or tiktok or whatever else is holding your interest. \nWhy not use your time more wisely? I don\u2019t understand.\n\nIf you\u2019re not 100% ALL IN to getting your degree, spend your $ and time elsewhere. I say this for your benefit! \n\nSincerely,\nA prof who is sadly more often seeing students waste such a wonderful opportunity to change their future for the better.",

Nearly every class in every subject follows the same exact teaching format. \n\nThere are only so many times we can stare at PowerPoint slides, then do \u201cfun in-class group activity #793\u201d followed by \u201ctotally unexpected I-Clicker quiz #374\u201d then go home to write \u201cthree paragraph discussion post we both know should have been two sentences but I needed extra word count #178\u201d\n\nI realize those things are pedagogically correct learning tools that are proven to help students remember information, but please understand we as students take 50+ different courses in a row back to back for six years (counting masters) and we just can\u2019t make ourselves care about your PowerPoint anymore at a certain point after seeing so many identical ones before it.\n\nI genuinely enjoy school and learning, but the way universities run things is so incredibly monotonous that it sucks the joy out of even the most fun topics.",

I think college, for many students, is basically like a second high-school.

If that\u2019s you- I encourage you to drop out and come back later, or to seek a technical degree. No shame in that! Just don\u2019t waste your money on something you\u2019re barely even getting anything out of.

Not much incentive to pay attention to a lecture if I\u2019ve heard the exact same one the last semester, and the semester before that, and the semester before that\u2026\n\nC) introductory classes are especially guilty of this, but they\u2019re not the only ones: being a repeat of a high school course essentially, especially when it comes to the Gen Ed requirements. See B) for further explanation \n\nD) Cazzo dio, some of you are just bloody annoying to listen to. Nothing against you personally since idk who you are, but probably 20% of my professors have been migraine-inducingly annoying to listen to, and they seem to also have mandatory attendance or threaten surprise quizzes to try and make it essentially mandatory without saying so in the syllabus \n\nE) some students process the knowledge and retain it better when it\u2019s being filtered on a subconscious level. Doing a brainless activity like scrolling through social media gives the conscious something to zone out to while the subconscious picks up all the knowledge being dropped.

But I had no issue absorbing what professors were saying while I did it. I would even ask questions(but still wasn\u2019t looking up from my laptop). I know it is frustrating but some people want to start being successful while they are still paying a ridiculous amount of money to be taught and some people aren\u2019t going to find what you are teaching to be challenging enough to keep their entire attention. \n\nAnd in the case of intro classes(even the advanced classes), a lot of the time students already know the material but are required to attend or have their grade affected. Just because someone is required to show up to and take your class does not mean they actually need to be there. They may just be checking boxes. \n\nThank you for caring about your students and being passionate about what you do. But remember there are likely some people in your classes who are already smarter than you. And there are people who can passively absorb what you are teaching. And there are people who just need to pass your class so they can get a degree in an unrelated field. \n\n\nDon\u2019t let it discourage you. All that matters is that there will be a student or two that you have made an impact on. When you are an intro professor you aren\u2019t just teaching a subject, you are molding young adults into who they will become. You are their first experience with freedom, where the possibilities are endless and boys are becoming men. Years later you look back and remember the intro professor who treated you as a colleague instead of a child. That first Professor you called Jeff instead of Dr. Douchebag. You get to be the first person to let someone know that they can make what goes into a textbook instead of just read one. Don\u2019t let the opportunity you have been given go to waste.",

            "comment": "Late to comment, but I tend to be more engaging and more interested in being in class when profs are competent and caring. I actually do better for my profs who care. When certain profs are mean, passive aggressive, or just overall nasty and trying to make my life miserable, then sorry, there goes my effort. \n\n*If you\u2019re not 100% ALL IN to getting your degree, spend your $ and time elsewhere. I say this for your benefit!*\n\nGreat advice BUT no one can live on minimum wage. No one, unless you want like 5 jobs.",

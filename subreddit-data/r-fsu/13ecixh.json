    "postText": "Hi, does anyone know if someone will get removed from the pathways program if they received a \u2018C\u2019 in a college class their final semester of their senior year, before their start in the summer? Getting a \u2018C\u2019 stops the pathway in the summer and fall semester, so would this also happen if you get a \u2018C\u2019 right before?\n\nAsking for a friend. I\u2019ve just graduated lol.",

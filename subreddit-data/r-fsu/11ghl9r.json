I applied to fsu online part time msw program, I was wondering if there\u2019s even a chance I get in\n3.2 gpa in communication sciences and disorders \nI had my three letters of rec and feel good about my personal essay. \nHeld jobs throughout undergrad and a few volunteer hours in the speech language department. Do I even have a chance ?",

My gpa was a bit higher, but I\u2019ve been told they put more weight on the personal essay since that\u2019s how they determine if you\u2019re a good fit (also told they more often than not accept current/former fsu students). Good luck!",

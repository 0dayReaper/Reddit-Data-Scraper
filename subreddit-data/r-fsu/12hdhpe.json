    "postText": "Im from out of state and I'm not sure whether FSU admits you as long as you meet the requirements for transfer or based on availability in program so they choose applicants with higher gpa than requirement, specifically for CS. I'm aware its a limited major but from what I've seen they require a 2.65 gpa but admit very few with lower than 3.0. My gpa is a 3.0 flat so I'm very curious if I'm a competitive applicant and if not what were your GPA when you transferred for those majoring in CS.  \n\n\nP.s. No AA, will have 60+ credits and prereq for cs done by summer, applied for 2023 fall, gpa 3.0 time of application (gpa includes course I got a D/F's in and grade for those failing grades I retook)",

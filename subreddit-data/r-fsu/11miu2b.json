There are multiple people I know on campus who have had over a dozen separate Title IX reports filed by different students/teachers. It takes so much to get rid of these rapists. \n\nIn my own experience, I had a man try breaking into my suitemate\u2019s room. He managed to get into two other girls\u2019 rooms. That same man had two of our professors file Title IXs against him for misogyny and ableism. So many people who know him reported him and he was never kicked out of our college. He still lived on campus for 4 years despite that track record. Our Title IX system is so ineffective and it leads to people getting hurt and rapists/abusers getting degrees. \n\nI deeply hope that we can reform this system and create stronger protections for victims so that the integrity of this institution and its alumni is upheld.",

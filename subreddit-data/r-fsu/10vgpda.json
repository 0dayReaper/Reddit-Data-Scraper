My room selection is coming up and I was wondering if there is anything I should know about DeGraff rooms that one is better over the other? Or are East and West the same. I would prefer a side where it\u2019s quieter or technically farther from the strip. Thanks",

            "comment": "i lived in east a few years ago and never really had a problem with noise from the strip. i was on the first floor right by the door so the most i heard was kids coming in late but only if i was already awake. the actual dorms themselves are nicer than some that are closer to campus so i wouldn\u2019t be too worried about anything like that! I\u2019ve been in west a little bit before and it seemed to me like they were pretty similar when i lived there i think the biggest difference was small things like vending machine selections",

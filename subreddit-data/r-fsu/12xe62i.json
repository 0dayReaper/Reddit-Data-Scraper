    "postText": "We own a little house a mile from the Union, 3/2 with a yard and carport near where I lived in college. Our oldest just moved in, and every friend who visits instantly loves it.  Before moving in, they talked to a couple of old friends who are local and currently living with their parents about taking the other 2 bedrooms. While initially excited, these friends aren\u2019t in a particular hurry - one wants to travel to Europe first and both are still saving money to move out. We\u2019ve said that we definitely need it leased by August. Would it be unreasonable to say that they need to make up their minds and commit to a lease even if they don\u2019t start rent until August? If they change their minds, how late would students still be looking for a place? I don\u2019t want to hold it for too long, even for childhood friends I know, then miss out on renting it for the fall. ($450/month plus some utilities)",

Although most people want to have a plan sooner than later, I feel like July is when people start thinking about school again. I've personally signed my leases at random times like April and February, so I don't have experience when it comes to attempting to rent in the fall. I would say the sooner the better, but maybe give them until June/July to make up their minds. I'm sure people will be looking for places to rent last minute. You can also try to temporarily lease for the summer semester, and have them (your friends) lease for the fall.",

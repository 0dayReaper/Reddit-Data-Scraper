Landis is a good pick too because if it\u2019s location. I haven\u2019t heard bad things about other dorms but they\u2019re not in conventional spots like the ones I mentioned. The ones above are closer to landis, strozier, food places and parking lots if you have a car.",

They aren\u2019t chutes but rooms that the trash builds up in for the day. I preferred to stay there bc I wanted my own space. I didn\u2019t have a room by a wall next to a person but my roommate next to me did. You had the occasional loud noise or *inappropriate* noises from couples. If I could\u2019ve lived there again, I\u2019d do it for sure. It\u2019s not as loud as the regular dorms especially night.",

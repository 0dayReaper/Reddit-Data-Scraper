What about money for emergency vet bills? Who will keep it over the summer?\nPets aren\u2019t allowed in the dorms anyway.",

All I needed was a letter from my psychiatrist stating my mental health history (anxiety, OCD) and how my cat specifically helps me manage my symptoms. What I think also helped was that I had tried medications and they simply did not work for me, but adopting a cat did the trick. If you have any mental health history where an ESA could alleviate your issues, it\u2019s a simple process that you should start ASAP before move-in. If you don\u2019t have any of these issues - that\u2019s one drawback of living in a dorm :/",

My cat loved sitting there, munching plants, and watching students below.\n\nI gave up the entirety of my under the bed space to my cat. Other students used it for storage but if you\u2019re sharing a small room with a cat you need to sacrifice a bit. She had a play pen (kept open) with toys, blankets, a scratch post, etc.\n\nShe had a cat tower in the small corner right next to the closet \n\nI kept her litter box in my closet - it wasn\u2019t ideal, but it was really the only space that my roommate would accept.",

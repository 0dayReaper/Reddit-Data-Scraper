    "postText": "Hi everyone. I am a senior in high school and a prospective CS major. After spending months stressing over the college application process, I have finally received all my admissions decisions which means the time has come to make my final choice.\n\nOut of the 8 Florida schools I applied to, I got accepted to 6 of them: Nova, Florida Poly, FIU, USF, UCF, and FSU. After weighing out the pros and cons of each, I think it mainly boils down to UCF and FSU.\n\nI'm completely torn and I need some help making this decision. I know the replies here may be slightly biased, which is why I will also be making a similar post in the UCF sub so I can hear from both sides.\n\nBased on the research I've done, UCF would probably be the better option for my major and for internship/job opportunities. And as someone who's lived in Miami their whole life, the more populated and urban environment of Orlando won't be difficult to adjust to, not to mention it's much closer to my home than Tallahassee is. However, FSU would give me a more authentic, quintessential \"college experience,\" which I value pretty highly especially after the pandemic watered down nearly half of my high school experience. Plus my best friend will most likely be attending FSU so I wouldn't have to take my chances with a random roommate.\n\nWith that said, what are your thoughts? Feel free to ask me questions if you need more info, any help or advice is greatly appreciated :)",

I'm pretty sure UCF's CS and engineering programs are stronger, but not by much. Choose the school you feel the most comfortable at and can afford, which was FSU for me! Another thing that influenced by decision is the required \"weed out\" CS foundation exam at UCF. If you fail it, you'll be kicked out of the major, and I decided I don't want that extra stress in my college years. It was a tough decision between UCF and FSU, but I choose FSU for its amazing campus, people, and lifestyle that made it feel like home away from home :) Either way, you're going to get a kickass education for an affordable price (if you're instate) and amazing college experience!",

As for cost, both schools will cost about the same for me as I'm an in-state student with full Bright Futures. I think UCF is giving me a slightly larger scholarship, but at the end of the day the difference is negligible and I should be able to afford either school just fine with the money my family has saved up + whatever other scholarships I rack up along the way.

I've had great professors throughout the last 2 years. However, in order to take the higher core classes you need to pass the foundation exam which can be challenging. (Don't let this discourage you). But I've had classmates and friends who failed the foundation exam and had to change majors or move to different school. So definitely take that into consideration. \n\nI also think FSU cs is great for the most part and it's quite up to date in terms in curriculum. \n\nIf you care about living experience, Orlando is pretty great for the most part. A lot of things to do.",

Not to mention, UCF\u2019s campus is enormous, and you\u2019ll definitely recognize how nice it is to be in a smaller campus when you visit FSU. The clubs/bars are all around FSU\u2019s campus, within walking distance of all housing, which is just not a thing at all in Orlando (similar to Miami, I believe). However, I highly recommend UCF\u2019s program if you\u2019re going to focus a ton of time on your degree, particularly if you\u2019re going to do UCF\u2019s competitive programming degree. The graduates of that program (very, very rigorous) take the top spots of our regional programming competitions each and every year.\nLiving in Orlando is way more expensive and inconenient than Tallahassee, with Ubers, parking, cover, food costs, everything adding up!",

The legislatures didn't fund them like they should, STEM is overemphasized relative to the humanities, some sabre-rattling about tenure, but for the most part left alone on matters of academic freedom and day to day operations. In Florida it's paid off. We have one of the best state university systems in the country, and it's being lit on fire to own the libs.\n\nTo be clear, HB 999 and the absolutely hostile takeover of New College is bananacrackers even by the standards of conservative states.",

Graduate programs are beefing up. RMI was #1 in the nation a year ago I believe, real estate top 10. Kind of going off memory there so could be wrong. State of Florida has a strong public university system and the university as a whole is becoming extremely competitive in a lot of fields. President Thrasher set some goals while he was there that were achieved, and from everything I understand President McCullough is leading in a way to continue on that path. There\u2019s a lot that would need to happen, but I\u2019d be optimistic about the future.",

If I've been accepted into FSU and NYU . Was wondering what your guys thoughts and suggestions would be . NYU is a dream school but FSU would be so much cheaper as an FL resident with Bright Futures .",

You gotta be good.\n\nYou are comparing the most expensive private school in the country (after living expenses) with a public school that you get in-state tuition for and 75%-100% covered by the state government.\n\nIts a no brainer dude.",

            "comment": "I haven\u2019t taken classes at the film school, so take this with a grain of salt, but from what I\u2019ve heard from the people I\u2019ve talked to who study there and have worked there, it has the same problems as all other film schools, and the same problems as all other small organizations. Your personality may not be a good fit, and because of that you could very well be miserable, and you may not get out of it what you were hoping to get out it.  \n\n\nThe only thing I can say for sure is that the production program is more designed for directors and cinematographers, if you want to do art or post then you may not be able to demonstrate your abilities in a way that helps you get a job; projects are built around directors, and if you talk to the dean, he\u2019s very concerned with story, and, from what I got from him, not much else.   \n\n\nGo find some film school students and grads on instagram and DM them for a more complete picture. Ask them what they wanted to do for work when they went to film school and if they got to do it. They won\u2019t mind or find it weird it all, they\u2019ll either love to flatter the film school or trash it.  \n\n\nThat said, if you wish to procede with a film school education in any place, in my experience in an adjacent industry, getting lucky enough to meet connected people at times when you have value to them that they can repay is how you start an actual career in an industry that is overflowing with a supply of eager young students.  \n\n\nDepending on your goals, you may find NYU has more people who can help you. I can\u2019t say that as an objective fact, but there\u2019s more going on over there for sure, but you have to get yourself in front of the right people, and even then, that\u2019s not entirely in your control - it may happen to be that because it\u2019s a bigger name, those people will be less receptive towards you.  \n\n\nWhatever you do, please take care. If you look out for yourself you\u2019ll be fine either way.",

            "comment": "I'm not a film school student (Creative Writing, aiming to be a screenwriter) but FSU's film *community* is really fantastic. The film club is a lot of fun for making and discussing movies, and there's also the SLC, our student-run free movie theater. There are weekly meetings where we get to vote on what films play, and there's always a really great variety of screenings throughout the year, with at least one student film festival a semester. There's also Script to Screen, a club for screenwriters, and going off-campus there's independent movie theater All Saints Cinema as well as the very cool video rental store Cap City Video Lounge.\n\nAlso, although this part is just a matter of personal opinion, it's impossible for me to hear about NYU without thinking of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rL3pHEmA_I) video. So keep that in mind.",

Tisch is world renowned and FSU is not as well known , but the smartest option is Florida and it looks like a great program . Found out last week David Mitchell has been here too .so very cool",

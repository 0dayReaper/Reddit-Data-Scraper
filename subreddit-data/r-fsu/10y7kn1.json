    "postText": "I've been trying to change majors from engineering to computer science since Fall 2022. At first the CS advisor said I needed to start Programming I and Unix to see how things went. I'm taking both classes and doing well. I requested again to make the change and now the CS advisor is telling me that I need eight (8) hours of science under my belt before she will transfer my major. Makes no sense because I could just decide to pursue a BA which requires no science. Has anyone experienced this issue?",

Most of the point of CS-BS is that it has the additional math and natural science requirements so it makes perfect sense they'd require some of it to be done before admitting. \n\nIt's irritating if you didn't get that guidance upfront though, and I sympathize. Receiving incomplete advising isn't just frustrating but it's an impediment to getting where you're trying to go.",

I see no reason you shouldn\u2019t be able to switch your major into the BA program.",

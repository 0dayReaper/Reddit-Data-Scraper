Pretty firm in my career, got an AA at TCC back in 2010 or 2011 and I want to finish off my bachelor's at FSU.\n\nI don't know who I need to talk to, what the process is, or what requirements I'll need to meet.\n\nI've emailed admissions and an advisor and haven't heard back after about a week. Any advice is welcome.\n\nThanks in advance.",

You just fill out the form, have TCC send FSU your transcripts, and wait for an acceptance. Very easy process.\n\nYou might also want to look into FSU online degrees that wouldn\u2019t require quitting your job to attend classes.\n\nLink: https://admissions.fsu.edu/transfer/apply/",

            "comment": "The key thing with admissions is deciding which program you want to look at and reaching out to that college to verify what requirements are for the given major. Also, if you're a working professional, FSU does a handful of online bachelor's programs. Not all of those do, but the ones that have a dedicated distance learning advisor also tend to be really good at working with and meeting non-traditional students kind of where they're at, whether they actually do the online program or the in-person equivalent\n\nhttps://distance.fsu.edu/programs?degree=146&amp;college=All&amp;majors=All",

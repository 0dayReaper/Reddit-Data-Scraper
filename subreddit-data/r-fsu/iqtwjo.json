None of that is necessarily bad, but it was also somewhat like the profile of Thrasher.\n\nTK could have been terrible; he pushed for FSU to have a college of chiropractic medicine. If that had happened, FSU would really have taken a massive hit in academic circles. He also didn't really do much to propel FSU ahead, and I was thinking Thrasher would be Wetherell all over again.",

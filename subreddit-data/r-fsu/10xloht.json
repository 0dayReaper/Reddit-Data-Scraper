            "comment": "TLDR: Shipping diplomas is a multistage process that takes time. When in doubt, log into myFSU and pull your unofficial transcript - if your degree is listed on the last page, that's all that matters because the transcript is what actually says you graduated.\n\nGrades post the Wednesday after commencement (in Fall that was December 14) and the process to review students for graduation begins (commencement ceremony the weekend before doesn't really mean anything for actual graduation). \n\nDegrees posted to transcripts January 5. Diploma orders are always placed \\~2 weeks after degrees post for a semester. They get placed on Fridays but sometimes like for the mass graduation order can happen earlier in the week. This semester that was the week of January17.\n\nStudents receive diplomas in the mail 3-4 weeks after ordered. Based on that, give it another week or so before wondering too much.",

    "postText": "So, I just wanted to share something. Last year, I applied to grad school and was denied. It had been almost 7 years since I had graduated with my Bachelor's, despite years of work experience in my field of study, they wanted more from me. \n\nIt's been a full year, I've been working here as a T.A. for one of the undergrad classes, was promoted to a senior engineer position at my main job, and I tried again. I was finally accepted into the MS-IDS-CS. Here at FSU. \n\nDon't give up to those who were not accepted. Keep trying, because in the end, if it's meant for you, it'll work out.",

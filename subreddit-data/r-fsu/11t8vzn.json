    "postText": "Hello! I am an incoming freshman to FSU, and am interested in the field of urban planning. I know that FSU offers the masters for this, and a bachelors/masters pathway, however I am unsure of what bachelors to go with this if i choose to go this route. Also, how long would a bachelor's/masters pathway take to complete typically? I applied to fsu for the Interior Design program, which i still do have an interest in, but I think I prefer Urban Design. If anyone has any advice/info/reccomendations related to either of those programs i'd appreciate it!\n\nAlso, if anyone knows, is there a good way to find a roomate with common interests? I'm not sure how an experience with a completely random person would be.",

            "comment": "Re: urban planning. I minored in it while I was in there so that\u2019s a good way to explore the interest without outright committing. If you want a job in that field you need a masters. So might as well explore other interests in undergrad. \n\n\nAs you likely know, the interior program is very prestigious and challenging, but worth while. \n\nRe: interests, look into FIGs (freshman interest groups) and LLCs (Living Learning Communities) \n\nCongrats on admission to FSU! Don\u2019t press yourself too much about knowing what you want to do. Have fun and explore every interest \u2014 it\u2019s an amazing school.",

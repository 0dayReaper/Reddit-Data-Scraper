If there's real chemistry there and she seems genuinely into you, then talk to her about the possibility of you going to. If you don't have concrete attachments here like dependent family or a job of your dreams, then there's no reason to not explore this opportunity. Not just for the sake of giving it a shot with her, but for the sake of traveling the world and new experiences. Remember, there are trains all over Europe and pretty much every country is on the table for a weekend/long-weekend trip. \n\nWhether it's long distance talking/visits, to make sure it works before moving, or just both of you taking a chance and diving in. Either way, you should definitely ask. You likely won't have this freedom in your life for too much longer and while it may not work out, you can always move back. But you can't go back in time and have a do-over when you're 40.",

There was a bubbling spring next to me and it would fill some wooden bucket and dump every 10 secs. It was very very zen white noise to sleep by. Very much worth the visit. You can then drive or bus to Prague. Did that and then I think Berlin. It's a fun time.",

The game is still very much afoot.\n\nRegardless of your relationship, visiting Eastern Europe is a great trip, something you should do anyways.  \n\nIf you can swing it, plan two weeks of going around Croatia, Slovenia, Czechia, Hungary,Slovakia - fly out of Vienna and plan to spend a few nights there on the end of the trip.  \n\nDo your trip, have a good time, try and meet up with her at some point at the end - no pressure just lunch or something.

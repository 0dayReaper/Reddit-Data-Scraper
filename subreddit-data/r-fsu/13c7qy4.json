    "postText": "Anyone know anything about the cap and gown return process? Trying to avoid any late fees, I know I got an email about there possibly being a late fee up to $250 after seven days since your graduation. I'm out of town because I got the fuck right after for once but I can go back in time but would prefer not to. Also, hoping to return it to the FSU Bookstore in person to get it off my hands which seems like an option online, but looking for any type of additional clarity. \n\nThanks :)",

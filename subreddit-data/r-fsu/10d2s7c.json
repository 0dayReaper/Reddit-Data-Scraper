It\u2019s not within the power of the counseling center I believe, so it\u2019s not their fault. Also, you may be partnered with a counselor-to-be, i.e. they\u2019re training and they\u2019ll tell you they\u2019re training, but I\u2019ve had good experiences with them nonetheless.",

I would definitely give the counseling center a try because it is free and on campus. Of course, if you don\u2019t click, there\u2019s plenty of other places around Tallahassee. My old psychiatrist\u2019s office has therapists on staff but I never did therapy there. She\u2019s at Capital City Psychiatry, which specializes in CBT but not ERP (if that\u2019s another avenue she wants you to go down). All the best!",

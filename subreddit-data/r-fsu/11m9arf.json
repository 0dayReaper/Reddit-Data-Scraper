    "postText": "I have some questions about transferring to FSU and conditional acceptances\n1. If I get a conditional acceptance does that mean I can get dorm housing or off campus student housing? Can I got to orientation and register for classes? Or do I have to wait until I get a full acceptance? \n2. I want to go to FSU in the fall semester, and I will be taking some prerequisite courses in the summer which will end in the beginning of August. Do you guys think that taking classes that end so close to when FSU starts will be a bad idea? I\u2019m transferring from another school and I just don\u2019t really want to fall behind and not be able to get housing, etc. I can take shorter summer classes if that might help.",

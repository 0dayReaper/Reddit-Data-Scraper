    "postText": "Hey everyone, this summer I plan to stay in Tallahassee for summer C semester and I\u2019m taking 9 credit hours. Finding a summer internship has been a nightmare for me, but I\u2019m hoping I can make a bit of money through other means. Does anybody have good ideas for part time jobs or gigs I could do in the afternoons and evening during the week? Any help is much appreciated!",

            "comment": "You could work as a receptionist at one of the info desks or residence hall front desks (you don't have to live in a residence hall to work as a receptionist). If you will be living in a residence hall, you could for summer B work as night staff where you would one or two nights a week provide night support at one of the other residence halls.  These jobs would give you quite a bit of time to do your studying and homework as usually people are not at the info desks constantly asking questions.  For the night staff job you typically spend the whole night from around 10:30pm until around 7am at the job.  You do rounds, which are a walk through of each floor of the building with the resident assistant (RA) going off duty at 11pm, and you then do 2 more rounds yourself.  For the self rounds you have the ability to call the RA or people from the night staff office if there arises a complicated situation.",

They should be able to tell you exactly how to apply for the jobs.  University Housing is an auxiliary part of the University so it has its own job application process as its budget comes entirely from students paying rent for their rooms.",

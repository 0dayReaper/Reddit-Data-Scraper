Attendance is kind of mandatory with iClicker points being awarded in class. Exams are very difficult, but doable. Beyond that, all the physics A profs will have similar formats to their class and work together to structure the material. Look into Skooler\u2019s if you wanna excel in the class and actually learn how to do problems as you won\u2019t learn anything useful on the exam during lecture.",

The lecture slides are confusing and he never uses class time to actually show you how those problems should be solved. I would go to class for participation points and do the schoolers because that\u2019s the only way to learn.",

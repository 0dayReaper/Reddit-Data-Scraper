    "postText": "How bad do you think your senior year grades have to be for your admission to be rescinded? Ive struggling with a bit of senioritis and went down to Tallahassee for a campus visit, where they reminded me that they can and will rescind your acceptance if you perform badly. Im a solid A-B student but I might slip up and get a C or two in my AP classes and i\u2019ve been scared straight and am on the path to turn them back into A\u2019s.",

I did IB and didn't get a \"passing\" score on the IB exam (I got a 3/7) which means I didn't earn college credits for the class. \n\nI was also really scared my admission was going to be rescinded. If you do okay on AP exams and end up with a C or two you will probably be okay. It sounds like you really care and are going to try to not end up with C's which is a good sign in itself. \n\nGood luck and congrats on your admission!",

    "postText": "I have been accepted into FSU undergrad economics, honors program, for fall 2023 but saw that the requirements include \u201ccompletion of a minor in a field related to economics or a second major.\u201d I guess that means I can\u2019t just pick an unrelated passion like music/piano, but rather finance, business, stats/math, or comp sci. Does anyone know what other options I have and which might be best for preparing myself to gain work/intern experience before pursuing an MBA? Maybe it\u2019s hard to tell since I don\u2019t know which field of economics I\u2019ll get more into. I know I can\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to grad school yet, but it\u2019s a dream I have.",

            "comment": "With economics you can basically go 2 paths. The more finance/business based path or the more technical/software based path(what I did). Although I did dive into both paths. Economics is truly one of the most slept on majors because it\u2019s basically a business major with more of a focus on the technical side. Believe me you will understand when you have to take Econometrics your senior year. I\u2019m not entirely sure how it works with MBA and what pre reqs you may need but just look up an MBA program you\u2019d love to go to see the pre reqs they require for the program.",

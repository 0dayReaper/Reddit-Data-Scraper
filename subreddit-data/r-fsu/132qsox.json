The master's program has let in over 200 students the last two years, and that number has severely hampered how prestigious the program once was.  \n\nSure, bringing kids in and getting them jobs is great, but when you're letting in that many, and the vast majority are barely gaining good paying jobs after getting a master's degree (though part of that is due to the job field of working in sports), it's not worth it.\n\nI love the program and the professors in the department (they're some of the best around the country), but unless you're using your master's degree to do the Doctoral program, you're better off saving your money and finding somewhere else which won't cost you a lot.",

Though I would still try like hell to gun for an LAP assistantship the department gives out.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t comfortable taking out more loans, go work in the field for a few years. See if what you want to do is really worth it. Then and only then, decide if you NEED to come back for a masters degree in SM.\n\nSpending money to get an \u2018advanced degree\u2019 to work in sports is not worth the money (unless it\u2019s like a Law degree or maybe an MBA). \n\nBe very wary of what FSU or other programs offer you. Unless there\u2019s a GUARANTEED chance you can get an assistantship, don\u2019t buy everything they sell. I can\u2019t speak for UF or Miami\u2019s programs, but what I have said goes for them as well.",

    "postText": "Ok so, I was a swimmer in high school and ended up getting badly injured in my knees my senior year\u2026I am now cleared to go back to light exercise and want to get back into swimming and was wondering if anyone has any answers to my questions! \n\n1. Are the people there judgmental or watching often? Or is it pretty empty?\n\n2. Do they have kickboards and pull bouy available there or should I bring my own\n\n3. Do they have locked storage other than the ones in the main gym? \n\nThanks for your help everyone!",

But I\u2019m pretty sure it gets pretty busy in the afternoons/evenings especially with CPR classes and water polo and other activities happening.\n2) I\u2019m pretty sure they have kick boards available\n3) if you want to get a proper locker they have them available to rent by the semester at the front desk of the leach, it\u2019s like 30 dollars a semester I think and it comes with a lock",

There are definitely hours where it gets a little busy but you usually more often than not can get your own lane. They have their own kickboards and stuff, and right at the pool entrance they have those temporary lockers just like in the main gym. All this plus the hot tub and honestly it\u2019s my favorite fitness resource on campus!",

I\u2019ve never had to wait for a lane. \n2) off to the side, there\u2019s a big storage rack with pull buoys, kickboards, floaties, etc. I\u2019ve never brought my own.\n3) there is locked storage right by the bathroom by the pool. It\u2019s the same style as the main floor. \n\nI learned how to competitively swim there. No one judges you while swimming. Everyone\u2019s been pretty nice. Definitely check it out",

Afternoon there is a lot more people sometimes someone is waiting. The swim club takes a few lanes 6-8 pm except on Wednesday and 4-6 on Friday I try to avoid those times and when other clubs are there \n2. They have a lot of pull buoys, kick boards, pool noodles and some other equipment (like a floating barbell, idk the name lol).\n3. There are lockers next to the pool and ones for $30 in the locker room. I like this option more because I can keep my suit there since I go often.",

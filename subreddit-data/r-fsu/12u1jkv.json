These will most likely be your hardest and most intense accounting classes unless you\u2019re naturally good with it. Some people were. \n\nI hated Cost Accounting with everything in me but I had a terrible professor who I don\u2019t think is there anymore. It\u2019s like an even more in-depth version of managerial so if you did okay in that then you\u2019ll be fine. \n\nAIS was very boring but not too difficult. The lectures will put you to sleep. \n\nAudit was a fun class for me, it was very interactive and the professor was awesome. Some people did not like it, but I thought it was a lot less intense than other accounting classes. \n\nTax 1 and 2 I was kinda indifferent about. They\u2019re not super hard but there are a lot of rules to learn and it was so boring to me. I think I liked Tax 1 more than 2\n\nBUL was really easy",

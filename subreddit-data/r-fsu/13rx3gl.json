I worked 20 hours through most of my time, and took 4-5 courses each semester,, depending on what was available online or in person, and only 2 my last semester. Worked full time in grad school, and did 4 classes, 3 last semester. \n\nBasically, stay 4-5 classes so you're eligible for scholarships you apply for and Pell grants.",

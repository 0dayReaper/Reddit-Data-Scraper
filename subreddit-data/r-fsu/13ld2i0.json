    "postText": "I'm taking FIN 3244 (Financial Markets, Institutions, and International Finance Systems) with Mahsa Khoshnoud and I am wondering about whether or not I should buy the textbook. The course seems straightforward enough and it does not seem to include any difficult math. It's only $20 over the course of six weeks but I do not want to pay for something I will not use, is this worth it? I also wanted to ask if the Financial Calculator is worth it and if I will use it in future finance courses.",

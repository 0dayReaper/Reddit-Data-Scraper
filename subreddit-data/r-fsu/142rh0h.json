But that mightve been because i took 0 calculus classes in high school so it was my first time learning derivatives and integrals and stuff like that. Fall freshman year i took college algebra, macroeconomics, cgs, and intro to environmental science. Spring i took biz calc, micro, intro to space science, and enc1101.",

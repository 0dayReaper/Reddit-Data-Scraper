But the feeling will end. \n\nSome things that helped me were things like cleaning the apartment, you will feel good about accomplishing something and be happy once your surroundings look better. Eat something healthy, hunger can literally cause sadness the same way some people get hangry. Don\u2019t just eat something convenient, eat something healthy it will make your brain and body feel better. Get out of the house the best you can, go for a walk on a nature trail or even just go to the dog park. It\u2019s good for your mind to change your surroundings and being in nature is proven to relax your mind. \n\nKeep moving forward, you can do it!",

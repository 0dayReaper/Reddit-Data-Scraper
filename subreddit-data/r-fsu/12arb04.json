Companies all around the world can buy this data, and whether choose to make their investment back in the form of making an ad and explicitly hoping you buy something is not always the end goal. I'm not defending TikTok in any case, but to act as if these companies just want to be better advertisers is [ignorant at best](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/06/24/data-collection-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/?sh=313604ea45fa) and [harmful at worse](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/why-data-not-privacy-real-danger-n966621). And every time you accept a privacy policy, especially on a free website, such as Reddit, your data is the product. What happens when you don't even get an ad? [When you just simply use the website and they track you?](https://www.security.org/resources/data-tech-companies-have/) What about when they do collect all the data for advertisement and then it leaks everywhere, free of charge, on the dark web? You need to explore your own questions further rather than taking things at face value since you are sort of parroting the bigger headlines. And remember, just because something doesn't make headlines, doesn't mean it's news. News companies and governments work hand-in-hand to promote and not promote certain articles, right here in our own country. While we could have a more poignant discussion on the ethics surrounding TikTok and ByteDance, simply resorting to a nativist party-line doesn't quite cut it, especially in the age of chatGPT who quite literally taps into all this data.",

I'm usually pretty liberal on most things, but if it actively and purposely harms us for the good of a government that hates us, I'm not got it, at all. FB isn't purposely selling our data to the CCP. We should regulate and stop foreign intervention that is actively trying to harm us, and in the meantime strengthen domestic oversight of American companies selling our data which ends up in the hands of foreign adversaries.",

I spent 4 years studying at FSU hearing lectures from my IT professors all about how this is the case.\n\nThis is definitely an political backed policy rather then a fact backed policy. They want to show that they are strong against China while doing the same censorship as China. \n\nNow they\u2019ve banned tiktok and several other chat apps from companies that are adversaries to the US. Well, why didn\u2019t they ban Fortnite? League of Legends? Valorant? All of those are owned by Tencent. They can all get our juicy data. Well any game made with unreal engine can be banned since it\u2019s owned by China. Also easy anti-cheat too. Might as well say we can\u2019t play games anymore at FSU. \n\nHow about we just get to the heart of this and just ban businesses from china working in the US. That\u2019s practically the goal of this policy ain\u2019t it? Well, just know you\u2019ll kill the economy that way since they will just do the exact same thing to us. Big corporations love the Chinese market and their hands are deep in it.\n\nNow, an actual sensible thing to do is actually working on getting some data protection laws passed. That is the first step. Another thing that should be done is force companies that use recommendation algorithms in the US to have them publicly documented. That is the true heart of the issue. TikTok\u2019s algorithms supposedly have sway to influence the masses. It\u2019s the way they have stayed ahead of the competition. And the US politicians don\u2019t like that they don\u2019t have that influence. Make all recommendation algorithms known and it will influence customer choice. Another way to look at it. Food products are sold with a list of ingredients. People like to know what they consume. Right now most of these algorithms are secret. Twitter just recently released theirs which shows that it is possible and people can tear them apart for specific bias\u2019s in it. I say we treat the algorithms like ingredients on the back of a cereal box.",

On one side, yea tiktok is definitely dangerous and it would be a good thing to limit its influence as much as possible. On the other side, measures used to limit tiktok run the risk of setting a precedent which could then be used to limit any number of social media platforms; which in turn limits peoples ability to speak freely in the modern public forum: the internet. People who don\u2019t care about the issue but want to to inhibit free speech will leech onto the Pro-ban side of the argument and make it look bad. People who don\u2019t care about the issue but are sympathetic to China may leech off the anti-ban side, making it look bad. In short, I can see this debate quickly devolve into: you can\u2019t advocate for a ban without aligning with Tea Party republicans. You can\u2019t advocate against the ban without seeming like a commie. Real Catch-22 we got here boys",

In 2015, China announced its \u201cDigital Silk Road\u201d (DSR) plan. The DSR\u2019s focus on data gathering represents a key feature of the CCP\u2019s overall Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) designed to develop economic and strategic influence globally, explained the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The CCP sees data as a critical means to integrate market advantage, national power, and strategic influence as well as to develop machine learning models. In 2019, the CCP declared data a \u201cnational resource,\u201d reported Newsweek, with the Party prioritizing it on par with land, labor, capital, and technology.\n\nAdditionally, TikTok has shown a willingness to take unethical action through leveraging internal app data. In a December 2022 incident covered by CNN, TikTok admitted to accessing the locations of several journalists as part of an investigation into whether they had leaked internal documents to the broader press. Another risk is TikTok's operators could augment the app via a patch or update effectively infecting users' devices for other malicious purposes, granting them even greater surveillance and control of real-time user data in the event of heightened tensions or a national conflict. Given TikTok\u2019s deference to the CCP and recent history of exploiting sensitive user data for targeting purposes, this poses a real risk that the CCP will use this data to target journalists and Chinese nationals abroad as well as pursue intelligence-related goals.\n\nhttps://www.cisecurity.org/insights/blog/tiktok-influence-ops-data-practices-threaten-us-security",

    "postText": "I was looking for opinions on going to FSU for engineering. I like FSU more than all the other Florida schools I have done tours for. I like the atmosphere and campus a lot. However I haven\u2019t heard great things about the engineering department. I don\u2019t care about having to go off the main campus for classes, I\u2019m used to driving 35 minutes to get to school. That being said, I have heard that the programming is underfunded and not as good because it is shared. Just looking for honest opinions, thanks. Also btw I\u2019m looking at going for industrial engineering",

            "comment": "Mechanical here and the engineering here is what you make of it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily underfunded, since we get funding from both FSU and FAMU, and we have ties into the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory which is on the innovation park campus along with our engineering college, and is federally/grant funded. \n\nAs an undergraduate, research and extracurricular opportunities are at least as rich here as any other Florida school, if not more. \n\nI can\u2019t speak to the industrial specific curriculum, but early general Ed and engineering courses are of comparable quality to other schools. A large portion of the senior teaching staff are well renowned in their fields, especially in the material science realm thanks to a lot of staff also running research at the MagLab. \n\nThe No. 1 draw if FSU for me was the availability of opportunity. I\u2019ve worked in three different research laboratories as an undergrad and I\u2019m not an outlier.",

            "comment": "I did my EE and MSEE at FSU. I got a great education there and have a good career now, but as others said, you get out what you put in. That's the nice thing about hard sciences, F=ma no matter who teaches it. All ABET accredited colleges have to teach the same topics. I have worked alongside many UF grads, as well as GT and VT grads, etc. and hold my own with them. The best advice I can give is pay attention and make sure you understand physics well, as it's the foundation of everything else.\n\nThe only downside of FSU is it made it harder to get my first job than if I had gone to a higher ranked school. Like it or not employers look at school and GPA to sort new grad resumes. The lower ranking is mostly due to the fact that it is a young college - it only started in 1985. In my case I graduated with a mediocre 3.2 GPA (mostly due to C's in freshman year non-engineering classes) in a soft job market and didn't have any great offers. However my classmates with 3.8+ all got offers from big companies. Fortunately I had an offer to work as a research assistant and have my Masters tuition paid for, and got straight As in my MS. So make sure get good grades, even in the boring humanities. There are a lot of opportunities (like my RA position) if you are motivated.",

Most of the negative stuff is not-so-thinly veiled digs at FAMU for being an HBCU and has nothing to do with the quality of the programs. \n\nAs u/supersmolcarelevel said, it is what you make of it. That's true for any major at any large state school. COE grads go on to get good jobs and are well regarded in the workplace.",

I would recommend the joint experience especially because it allows you to do your prereq courses at fsu then go to the coe after for the major course work.",

It should get more attention than it it gets.\n\nThat being said, when I was an EE student the advising was terrible and there was little understanding for students that didn't fit into the advising mold, like working students, or students that had an odd mix of credits.\n\nThat ended up contributing to my exit from the school and me heading over to the IT program.",

If you're used to a heavier course load and don't have many other responsibilities over the summer (and don't mind spending your entire day in classes) then I'd say go for it. I'd also just warn you that it gets HOT over the summer and walking to and from your classes can be a little torturous in the heat. But with all that said, 9 hours isn't too bad, but considering you're wanting to do business calc, I'd only do 9 if you really think you can handle it. Don't sell yourself short, but also know what you're getting yourself into!",

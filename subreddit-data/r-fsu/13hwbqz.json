If so, I would graduate in 3 and do grad right after to minimize the cost. If not, then its more of a 50/50. This is going to be one of the only times in your life where all of these amenities/events are all in one area, and 'free'. So you could take your time and enjoy what FSU has to offer. (Gym, Rez, Campus Events, Clubs)",

Don\u2019t expedite this stage!",

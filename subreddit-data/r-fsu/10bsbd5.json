I am NO where near the loan the limit, is this an error or do I have to wait? \n\nI\u2019m gonna Tuesday but I\u2019m just stressed out because I\u2019m going to be behind on some bills, thank you and have a safe weekend",

This is the only reason I could think that they would not offer loans.\n\nUnless you\u2019re in the exact situation I was in, I would email financial aid. Don\u2019t bother calling bc they won\u2019t pick up",

Both my bright futures and fafsa ran out.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for private loans, check out Ascent Funding and College Ave. I have one from each company and they offer decent loans to students with bad/no credit and no co-signer",

But I think with having the Montgomery gi bill you are able to change to the post 9/11 gi bill all you have to do is call the VA and say you want to change it. This would help with paying bills since they pay the school tuition directly and you would get your monthly BAH ( approx $1400)",

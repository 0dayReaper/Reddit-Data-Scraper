I was kind of in the same boat when I graduated:\n\nObviously, first make sure that you are absolutely 100% cleared to graduate and have turned in EVERYTHING to the right people. Sometimes you get those emails and you don't get the RSVP because woops, you forgot to turn in your POL form.\n\nIf you're 100% in the clear to graduate and have RSVP'd for the graduation, expect the ticket email to come out much closer to the actual date. I think for my graduation, tickets came out the week before.\n\nLastly, the reason why people are hounding about tickets now is because they're trying to locate people that are giving/selling extras.",

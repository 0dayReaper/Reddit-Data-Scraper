    "postText": "Hello everyone, I was recently accepted to FSU as [Presidential Scholar](https://presidentialscholars.fsu.edu/scholarship-benefits). I intend to enroll as an Industrial Engineering major, but I am not sure whether to take this path or to consider changing my major to Computational and Applied Math. I am wondering if anyone in this sub would like to share their experience/perspective of the school and such programs. \n\n One reason for my unsureness is that, unlike other schools like UF and Georgia Tech, FSU does not offer a concentration in Operations Research. This is the topic in which I am most interested within Industrial Engineering, so not having this concentration worries me. The College of Engineering, although very good, does not offer as robust of a program as my other options in GT and UF. I am also not a fan of the CoE not being on campus. \n\nFrom my research, Industrial Engineering and Computational and Applied Math do have some overlap, and both are prerequisite degrees for an MS in Operations Research, which I intend to earn after undergrad. However, I am most interested in engineering, rather than a BS in math. Below I will add some pros and cons for each of my options. \n\n**Georgia Tech:**  \nPros - #1 in the country for Industrial Engineering; has a concentration in Operations Research; urban campus; my dream school for my major; amazing co-op and internship opportunities.  \nCons - gave no financial aid, would have to pay $50k+ per year combined; out of state.\n\n**FSU**  \nPros - I got accepted as a Presidential Scholar which entails: $14,000 Presidential Scholarship distributed over four years, $12,000 Vires Scholarship distributed over four years, $12,000 for educational enrichment opportunities, all on top of the Florida Bright Futures Scholarship; extremely small group of people who I will work with for four years, creating a close-knit community; beautiful campus; great campus life; in the Honors College; guaranteed undergraduate research opportunities  \nCons - Engineering college is shared with FAMU and is off-campus; Industrial engineering does not provide the Operations Research concentration.\n\n**UF**  \nPros - great engineering program; offers Operations Research concentration; top 5 public university, flagship state school; great campus life; many of my friends are attending; Florida Bright Futures Scholarship  \nCons - in Gainesville; no scholarship or close-knit community like that which is provided by FSU; not in the Honors College\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am very excited about my acceptance into the Presidential Scholars Program at FSU. I love how close-knit everyone in the community is, its dedication to community service, how we receive priority registration for classes, and how we have a personal scholarship and fellowship office for internships, co-ops, etc. However, the engineering school at FSU just does not have the reputation of Georgia Tech or UF. I will also not be able to study specifically what I want to if I go to FSU. I feel like if I was interested in any major besides engineering, I would attend FSU in a heartbeat.\n\nAs of now, I am slightly leaning toward FSU, but I just don't know if it will set me up for success in engineering in the future like I know both UF and Georgia Tech will. I understand that I will only get out of college what I put into it, which includes pursing internships, etc., but what UF and GT excel in my major, FSU lacks. Any help, consideration, or guidance, would be appreciated. Thank you everyone in advance.",

I mostly included it for program considerations and comparisons. I agree with your point about about tracking from a bachelors to masters degree, while in the process limiting debt.",

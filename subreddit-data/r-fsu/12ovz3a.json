    "postText": "Hi! I know theres a few posts already about fsu vs uf on both colleges' subreddits, but I am interested to see if anyone has any specific perspective on the PACE program vs FSU, esp in terms of a science major (and hopefully an art double major). Here are my thoughts so far:  \n\n\n**UF:**\n\nPros: \n\n\\- Love how easily accessible nature was. Within just a few minutes of walking I could be near a lake and beautiful wildlife- and lotsss of nature surrounding for hiking, kayaking, etc in the area. visited silver springs and it was GORGEOUS. \n\n\\- I actually really love the freedom of PACE for my first few years- I know I do well w online school and self regulating my schedule\n\n\\- felt like there was more efforts towards inclusivity and mental health at uf\n\n\\- higher ranking and better for STEM\n\n\\- trivial but the gator mascot and the whole \"chomp\" thing is so cute\n\n\\- I would be living at CLO (a cooperative living organization) so rent is super cheap- and I could live there all 4 years potentially\n\nCons:\n\n\\- I would likely have to take several of my science courses at Santa Fe during pace to effectively learn foundations- aka would cost a bit extra\n\n\\- more expensive tuition\n\n\\- I felt like Gainesville didn't have a tonnn of personality? Like lots of cool places to eat but not a lot of  areas that felt unique- art districts, etc\n\n\\- unsure if I can study abroad w PACE- also concerned about the limitations of PACE majors (cant change majors outside of pace majors)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FSU**\n\nPros:\n\n\\- cheaper! I am OOS but was given in state tuition\n\n\\- also had lots of nature near campus! (though I'm not sure if it had as much directly on campus as UF)\n\n\\- LOVED the surrounding area!!!!! downtown was so cute, I visited a super cute art district that I loved, etc. Felt like it had a lot of personality\n\n\\- STUDY ABROAD! They have so many options that id be eligible for (especially new Zealand omg)\n\n\\- my best friend is going there and shes my favorite ever (hi violet!!!!!!!)\n\n\\- campus was really pretty :-)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCons:\n\n\\- Lower ranking + less of a stem school\n\n\\- party school (negative)\n\n\\- again trivial but I am not. a fan of of all the pictures I've seen of students at games in like native American headresses and stuff- ik the school has a healthy relationship w the Seminoles as their symbol but idk if students do\n\n\\- not sure about price of living off campus but is prob more expensive than my UF living situation\n\n\\-proximity to Ron Desantis help\n\n\\- less mental health resources (as far as i was able to find from online sources)",

            "comment": "I\u2019m graduating from UF with a masters this month and went to FSU for undergrad.\n\nYour perceptions of the schools are not accurate.\n\n- UF is just as much of a party school, it\u2019s just a bigger university so the overall percentage of partiers is lower.\n\n- UF doesn\u2019t give a crap about your mental health and in fact most STEM students here are depressed specifically because of UF and the total lack of caring about students well-being.\n\n- I\u2019ve never seen a PACE student that didn\u2019t regret it and become spiteful about it because it\u2019s a very limiting program.\n\n- FSU is the #1 psychology school in Florida and has an extremely dedicated counseling center staffed by those #1 in the state psychology PhD students and professors\n\n- The Seminole tribe of Florida supports all of the student sports stuff and shares the profits of it. Back when the Redskins got in trouble for their team name the Seminole tribe actually fought very hard to protect FSU and make sure nothing happened to our sports teams.\n\n- Tallahassee is WAY cheaper than Gainesville. My expenses doubled when I moved to UF.",

Also like in terms of mental health and support I was referring a lot to their LGBTQ resources because they seem to have a lot more resources and events and such than fsu did (from a social media standpoint) and I know the Seminole tribe and the school itself have a good relations- again, just didn\u2019t love some of the student culture I saw from it. I understand it\u2019s a very small percentage of students- trivial things :-)",

Both schools are pretty equal on that. Both also have only one gay nightclub (926 in Tallahassee and University Club in Gainesville) so neither is really superior for the lifestyle, but Tallahassee seemed to have a tighter LGBT community whereas the UF people do their own thing mostly.",

Acceptance rate for transfer too UF is quite high and they take mostly from community colleges in the area so if you keep a good GPA at FSU you should be fine. Both are good schools and programs and are good choices.",

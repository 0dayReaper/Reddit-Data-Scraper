    "postText": "Her rate my professor reviews are the absolute worst I\u2019ve seen out of any professor I\u2019ve ever had, worse than both of my ochem professors but she\u2019s the only professor available. Anyone have experience taking her class? It\u2019ll be my first 4000 level course so I\u2019m just wondering if I should stick with her or take it in spring instead and hope for a different professor",

The majority of her Quizzes (multiple choice, but with complex choices) are analyzing/interpreting gels and what they mean. \n\nCourseload wise, it\u2019s not hard and you\u2019ll at most have to write annotated bibliographies on flash cards and do a presentation about a paper. (+ quizzes) \n\nI took her class two years ago, so I don\u2019t know if she has changed anything since. \n\nWhen comparing courses like Cell Structure + Function, molecular bio has much less content and less to memorize. It\u2019s about knowing what a image of lab results are telling you, if that makes sense.",

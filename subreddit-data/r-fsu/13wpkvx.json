For a fancier vibe, Bar 1903 is near the Capitol and themed like an old school library with high-end cocktails based on different time periods",

Both have options of eating too whether it\u2019s from the place or next door.\n\nClub bars would be Recess, Pots, or frankly anywhere in Collegetown is a good time. If you\u2019re coming in the fall, make sure it\u2019s not during first few weeks of classes.",

    "postText": "I am a senior and I just got in to FSU with the OOS tuition waiver scholarship. They gave the scholarship to OOS students who had at least a 4.0, 32 ACT, and all A's and B's. This is my last semester senior year and I am really struggling with AP Calc. If I end up with a C in this class, do they take my scholarship away? I am working my ass off to get a B, but I am not sure I am going to pull this off. This would be my only C in my entire high school career and I am having so much anxiety that this is going to ruin my OOS scholarship. Any experience? Do they take away scholarships after they are awarded? I can't find anything on the site about this situation. I am really worried because I won't know how this ends up before I have to commit to FSU and I won't be able to afford it if I lose the scholarship.",

Talk to your Calc teacher and explain the situation, ask for help or suggestions from them now so they know you are doing all you can. Find a tutor if you think that would help. At the end of the day all you can do is try your best. Everything will work out the way it is supposed to. You got this!",

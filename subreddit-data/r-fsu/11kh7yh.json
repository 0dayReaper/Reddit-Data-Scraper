He once told me that he didn't test directly on the material presented in lecture or the text, but tested instead on what the student should derive from the material covered. He was a very good instructor, albeit difficult but fair tester.",

I think Whalley is probably more difficult, but you'll learn more.\n\nI would take Whalley in a heartbeat between those options.",

            "comment": "Gary Tyson is probably the best lecturer I have ever had, but if you do not attend every lecture and pay attention / take notes you will have an awful time. I have a hard time believing any other professor could teach the same quantity of information for CDA3100 as Tyson, but Tyson also has a problem with teaching difficult material that is second nature to him, so he will often teach as if all of the material is equally simple to understand when it is absolutely not. I dont know anything about Whalley so I cant recommend one over the other, but with Tyson it will be one of those really difficult classes you *can* learn a ton from. Tyson also has a massive curve for the entire class, so even if you dont think you are doing well you still may be in A or B territory, its just really hard to tell.",

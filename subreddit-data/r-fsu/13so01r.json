It's asking for my taxes, even though I don't have any I am a dependent. I delegated the financial aid portion to my parents to submit their forms but nothing shows up on their end. I tried calling FSU financial aid, and it is stuck on that stupid \\\\\"we have a high call volume we cannot take your call message.\\\\\" Has anyone had to do this, if so could you provide some guidance and steps please.](https://preview.redd.it/ncy51poq3a2b1.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4b05f7b2ec718f1f568a54b1c0848872fc02df4a)",

If you dont file taxes you gotta make an IRS account and send them the letter of non filing, also if you miss anything they'll just send you a response with what you need and you can resubmit (I don't remember if theres anything else off the top of my head sorry!)",

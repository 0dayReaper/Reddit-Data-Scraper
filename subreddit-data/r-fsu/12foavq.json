They have a very loose definition of \u201cclimate controlled,\u201d but all of my stuff survived. I think it was also one of the only places with availability at the time, so definitely don\u2019t wait until the last minute to get this sorted. I was also told the UPS store on campus also offers summer storage but I\u2019m not sure how it works and how much it is.",

It was one of the cheaper climate controlled places in town and everything was there when I came back at the end of the summer. I\u2019d recommend it! I have no idea how their customer service is, I don\u2019t think I ever even made a phone call to the place as everything was handled online. They were also available fairly last minute at move-out",

    "postText": "I'm a senior right now and got accepted to FSU for the fall 2023 term. FSU was always my top choice but recently I've been having doubts. I'm concerned that it may not be for me because I don't plan to join a sorority or am a party person. I dont even drink or smoke. Not to say I'm a total bum; I just dont like the party scene. Im worried what I thought was my top choice is now a school where I won't fit in. I'm also worried about housing...and being paired with a roommate who may be the opposite of me... as in total party goer. Any advice....?? I need to decide soon if I commit to being a nole :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate: thanks guys for all the replies its really helped me in making my choice",

I wasn\u2019t much of a party goer myself and I\u2019m still not, but I still go out occasionally and I go out to every game and love it! FSU was definitely the right choice for me, despite minor inconveniences here and there. \n\nBased on what you described yourself as, I believe that you would also like FSU because there are a lot of amazing programs, clubs/organizations to join outside of frat/sorority, and overall it\u2019s just a really fun balance of working hard and playing just as hard if not harder. \n\n\nDw ab the Roomate situation too much, my Roomate parties a decent amount and besides him returning late at night he is usually quiet and doesn\u2019t cause disturbances. Just make sure to set boundaries at the beginning of fall semester and you\u2019ll be ok. \n\n\nIf you have any other doubts/concerns/questions pls feel free to PM me!\n\nGo NOLES\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9b\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9b",

I had these same reservations and going to FSU was one of the best decisions of my life. There is something for everyone, you don\u2019t need to be drinking or smoking to have a fun time going out if you choose to do so. There are tons of student organizations for a variety of interests where you can find likeminded people, and who knows maybe in your time there you learn something new about yourself and find the things you feel reserved towards do have a place in your life. I would understand not choosing FSU, but it shouldn\u2019t be because you\u2019re afraid of fitting in. There\u2019s all kinds of people there and many would love to have you. Hope this helps!",

My first semester at fsu was during summer and my roommate was a friend I knew from high school. He was definitely a partygoer and I wasn\u2019t, but we had a good balance and I started to break out of my shell a bit and join him out. I was always a home body in high school and I\u2019m certainly a home body again now, but I credit \u201cgrowing up\u201d at FSU. I think you have to take that leap of faith to help develop in life.

    "postText": "Hi I\u2019m an incoming freshman for Summer 2023 and was wondering if majoring in Interdisciplinary Medical Sciences is worth it. I hoped to apply to a PA program and wanted to just major in Psychology while getting all of my credits. Let me know if it would be best to change my major.",

A chemistry major can still go be a chemist, a biology major can go become a bio lab tech etc. while IMS has no clear backup plan. Most of the ones I knew regretted choosing it by the end or switched to something else.",

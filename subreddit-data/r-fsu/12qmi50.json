    "postText": "Hello everyone! Im gonna be an incoming freshman in August for the fall semester and had a few questions about the gym at Leach, specifically in regards to their weightlifting equipment since lifting is something Im passionate about and a hobby I really love doing. \n\n1. How packed does it usually get? I typically lift between 1 and 4 pm depending on my schedule. \n\n2. How is the variety of equipment? Im not super picky I mainly use allot of dumbbells and cables with some machine stuff (like leg extensions/leg press and machine chest fly) \n\n3. Specifically though does anyone know if they have a smith machine and trap-bar? \n\n4. Also do they have any rooms with kickboxing bags? I like to kickbox a little for cardio. \n\nThanks in advance!",

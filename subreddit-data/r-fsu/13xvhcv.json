Great professors too.\n\nWhen signing up for LS classes, make sure that they can cover as many requirements as possible. Check this [liberal studies website](https://liberalstudiescourses.fsu.edu/care/LS-courses/course-display.php). Search for the course, click on it and it will tell you what LS req it covers.\n\nDon\u2019t waste time and money taking classes that just satisfies one thing.",

Amazing professor and one of the nicest persons I've met. \n\nCan't remember what classes count for GE History requirements, but if courses taught by Dr Benjamin Dodds and Dr Cathy McClive are available, also go for those ones. Phenomenal teachers",

    "postText": "My son was denied, but since he'll be graduating HS with his AA, he was invited to apply instead as a transfer student. He doesn't have to create a new application to be considered, but there's a new link on his status page and all he has to do is indicate yes and select a major by March 1. He has to meet the requirements for the major. I assume that means he has to have completed all of the major's pre-requisites if there are any? What is the acceptance rate for a a transfer with an AA degree from a FL CC? What about for a major that is not limited access, and a 3.2 college GPA?",

International Affairs doesn't seem to require any pre-reqs. He wants to eventually get an MBA, so is that something he could do with a degree in International Affairs? \n\nHis overall college gpa is 3.2. However, he matured a lot in his junior year and started putting forth the effort and has had a 4.0 the last few semesters in all of his HS and DE courses.",

You could reach out to the College of Business to ask what they consider competitive for their MBA program. \n\nInternational Affairs is a really cool degree. He can minor in business if he wants too. Economics has some admission requirements that they may be updating for this coming Fall pending approval from DOE, so if he's interested in that, he'll want to touch base with their admission rep to make sure he has what he needs.",

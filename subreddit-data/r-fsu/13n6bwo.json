    "postText": "Hi so I applied for summer 2023 and I got in! I recently was diagnosed with a few medical disorders and have been having a pretty rough time. I spend most of my days at doctors\u2019 offices. Anyways, does anyone know if I can take my summer semester as all online classes and stay in my hometown to help me continue to get better instead of going all the way to Tallahassee. Then I would go to brick and mortar in the fall? Has anyone done this?",

            "comment": "Yes, many courses offered to freshman are available online. Bright Futures only applies if you are taking six-credit hours, therefore you should pick two easy classes and focus most of your time on recovering from your physical ailments and try to recover as quick as possible. Fortunately, most freshman classes are very introductory in nature and should not be too difficult. Good luck in your classes and I hope nothing but the best for your physical recovery.",

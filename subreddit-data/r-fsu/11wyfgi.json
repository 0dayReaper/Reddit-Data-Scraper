But I would recommend trying getting As in your courses especially in the sciences (A&amp;P 1 and 2, gen chem, bio, etc.) And also take both sociology and psychology. Although they said you can take either one, there is a little note on their website saying they strongly recommend taking both of them. For community service, unless you're already working as a PCA, CNA, or other related jobs, start volunteering if you haven't already. I did my volunteering at TMH. The program increased their slots from 72 to 84 which i think is a good thing. Goodluck!!",

The first two semesters are mostly didactic with some clinical rotations. Things become pretty intense the last two semesters of schooling as your clinical rotations step up.\n\nNow for tips. To be honest, I viewed prereqs such as Professor Young Su\u2019s anatomy and physiology to be harder than any didactic class I ever took. The hardest part from an educational standpoint are going to be exams. It wasn\u2019t uncommon to have multiple exams week after week. That can be overwhelming but nothing worse than what you\u2019ve gone through to get here. \nMy real tip would be to try to get real world experience while in the program. In the summer, TMH will offer Internships which will allow you to get more clinical experience. Additionally, try to get a nurse Extern position as well. I say this all because, in my career, I found the clinical experience to be much more beneficial to me.\nIf you have any questions, shoot me a message. Otherwise, congratulations and good luck!",

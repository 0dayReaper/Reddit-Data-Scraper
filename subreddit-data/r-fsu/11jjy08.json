So you had enough practice to learn the material plus you knew exactly how his exams were formatted. Plus he curved like insanity at the end of the semester (went into the final with a 79, ended the class with an A). I don\u2019t know if he will be the same for orgo 2, he isn\u2019t teaching it this semester so I have a different guy but I genuinely didn\u2019t mind him for orgo 1 so I doubt he would be much different for 2.\n\nI have heard pretty good things about Kearley though, but he also has pretty mixed reviews from what I know.",

He can be loud but he provides lots of practice material that usually mirrors his exams to a T. I also had Kearley and it was literally terrible. If you missed even a day of class you were lost and he doesn\u2019t upload his notes, only hand writes that on the white board. IMO he\u2019s a nice dude but kinda of an old-school and out of date professor. I\u2019d go with Hilinski.",

            "comment": "Oh, this is my jam. Campus is full of hidden gems. There is a rock garden behind Woodward garage, the labyrinth and bridge over by the psychology building. The murals on the wall before you enter the medicine courtyard. The king building courtyard, residence hall courtyards by traditions/wildwood/ragans. The courtyard by ALSC (though that might be on the tour), the Mina Jo poweel Green, it has an outdoor auditorium, greek park by landis hall. Sandels green and keen courtyard are also nice. There is a sundial by Bryan hall, the botanical gardens by the stadium, several statues are scattered around campus and more. As for near campus, check out Calvin's (by the music building) and gaines street has many options for food. It is south of campus. Check out the railroad square art district just south of that, lots of nice little shops and a skateable art park. Also the sugar rush milkshake bar and the bark. A bit further out but still walkable-ish.\n\nNow if you have a vehicle, check out cascades park, lake ella, the tallahasse museum, and the rez. Head to midtown to check out that area as well, it's got redeye coffee, venebites, table 23, kool beanz, and more. We are close to the Florida waterfall, about 45 minutes west of tally, and on the east side of tally right of the highway is backwoods crossing. There is also the historic capital as well. I have also heard about and drive past the mission San Luis but have not been personally. Hope this helps!",

            "comment": "I would recommend checking out the fountains on campus. Over by the med school on call st across from the diner is a pretty garden area with a nice metal flower sculpture we did. I would say check out the new union it has a bowling alley and a few other things nice places to eat if you haven't been already there's other cool stuff but you need to be in a class or know an employee to check out. I am one of the brick masons on campus. I would say check out Suwanee dining hall it has some beautiful beam and wood work in it. Also Culpeper I believe it has a neat little museum and the building st the back of Wescott at that three way has a library with beautiful stain glass windows and woodwork in it",

I did carpentry for 15 years before coming to fsu I still do remodel work and wood work on the side bar tops and stool and epoxy work. Love the wood work in some of the older buildings just turned 34 so I hope while I'm here they open the carpentry shop back up. The brick work keeps us busy though",

While you won\u2019t have time likely on a tour weekend, look up photos at least for St Marks Wildlife Refuge and the lighthouse, Wakulla Springs (manatees!), St George Island, the Panacea marine lab, Mashes Sands beach, and the Carrabelle WW2 museum. These are all between 20-90 minutes from campus and beautiful spots.",

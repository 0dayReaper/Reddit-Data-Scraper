Easiest thing to do is check out the program website and see all the requirements. Some have different requirements than others so check that throughly. They should also have a link/directions to apply. If you get stuck, all programs have at least one advisor to help with applying and other admin issues. That person/those people can be found under the faculty page of your program website. Good luck!",

Check out the [FSU Coastal &amp; Marine Lab](https://marinelab.fsu.edu/) as well.\n\nFSU has amazing biological diversity. Before you commit to moving here (especially for the time it takes to do a pHD), make sure you read up and know what you're getting in to, especially if you are LGBTQ. The university itself is welcoming, but the political climate is A LOT right now.",

IIRC, they benefited from the settlements in the BP/Deepwater Horizon disaster, so even though the Marine Lab's been around a while, they've had a bit of a reinvigoration in recent years. The only possible downside is that it's really remote, but given that you live in State College, you're used to that :-)",

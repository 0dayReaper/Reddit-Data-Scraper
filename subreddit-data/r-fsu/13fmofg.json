That\u2019s why my division tells incoming students that we need their final transcripts by the end of their first semester in the progress: it gives the schools time to get the degrees on the transcripts and gives the students one less thing to freak out over.\n\n\u2026and yet I will get 50 transcript emails this week while nobody works on getting other requirements finalized. C\u2019est la vie.",

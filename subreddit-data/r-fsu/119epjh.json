    "postText": "Ok so this might sound very stupid but I came to fsu for my first semester as a freshman and absolutely loved the school but made zero friends and knew no one that went there. I ended up transferring closer to home where I knew way more people but am now sort of missing the school spirit that fsu had. I was wondering if it would be possible for me to get my AA where I am now and then transfer back to fsu? Like would they not take me since I transferred out already or would they not care? Any advice is helpful, Thank you!",

And i\u2019ve read from lots of people that getting accepted as a transfer is super easy but it must\u2019ve become more competitive now right? Or for the most part, is it still just as easy as it was before? sorry for all the questions lol",

    "postText": "Hello, this is my first year at FSU and next year will be my second but I came into college with 27 credits and soon I will have enough credits to be a junior but the way me and my advisor worked my schedule out Ive done a lot of psychology classes (I\u2019m a prospective psychology major) alongside my AA. So i haven\u2019t completed my AA but I\u2019m almost done with that and not too far off my bachelors but I wanted to PSY3213C in order to knock out 2 of my requirements for my AA alongside the psych requirement. But i don\u2019t think I\u2019m \u201cformally admitted\u201d into the major. I have all the prereqs to the psych major and all of that but the course PSY3213C is the only one that says you have to be a psych major. And I\u2019m not sure if that means if I have to be formally admitted or I as a prospective psych major can take it too because I\u2019m not in any other major.",

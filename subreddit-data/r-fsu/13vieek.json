I have been reviewing the equations, taking the practice quizzes (homework), and watching the. lectures, but I still feel really unfamiliar with the topics. None of t is sticking. Anything I need to know about the class or summer session in general to help would be awesome.",

The videos actually do help unlike most finance classes. If your still allowed to use flash cards right really tiny and fit all formulas and concept questions that you don\u2019t think you can memorize",

I have a buddy who just graduated and his starting salary is 95k which is kinda low for engineering but he can work from home and hours are flexible.",

            "comment": "For the first couple years, you won\u2019t have much choice in what professors you take for general sciences. If you do get to make a choice, then just check rate my prof. I agree with other comment that the new neuro advisor isn\u2019t as good. If you\u2019re considering doing premed with psych major, I would just do neuro instead. Look at the classes you need to take for both majors and decide which one is more interesting to you. I don\u2019t like learning foreign languages so I would suggest getting the requirement out of the way early. Keep your first year\u2019s schedule loose enough to give you time for joining clubs and other activities.",

I\u2019d suggest getting letters of rec from science professors when you feel that they would write a good one cuz it can be hard when you\u2019re in a class of 300 people. Google fsu pre health advising, and they have a bunch of information and materials about being premed. What specific questions do you have about it?",

That being said, there is an organization on campus called USSTRIDE, which is an outreach program from the college of medicine. Through them I got a discounted MCAT prep course and a full scholarship to get certified as a medical assistant. \nThe career center does do mock interviews. There is only one formal FSUshadow program that I know of, it is not great in my opinion. You\u2019re better off trying to secure your own opportunities when it comes to interning or shadowing. There are different pre-med organizations on campus that will also have connections with local physicians and offices, and they will be able to help you with those sorts of things too. \nI do not think there are any specific statistics to FSU\u2019s pre med population, at least not that I know of. It\u2019s probably hard to track since people will come in thinking they\u2019re going to be premed and then fail chem and switch to finance",

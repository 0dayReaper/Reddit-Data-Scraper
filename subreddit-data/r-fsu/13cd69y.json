            "comment": "Lived/Had friends live here for 3+ years. Nice apts, don\u2019t get anything ground floor if you can bc of the high foot traffic. Very close to campus and if you cut through the LDS church, you can walk almost straight through to college of medicine. It\u2019s also close to the nitenole route. Just exercise caution at night sometimes bc the parking lot and the trail up the hill can attract weird types and bored drunk frat bros. Good location for walking and taking the bus but I think East/Southeast of Campus has me more involved in student life.",

The only issue i had was sometimes cars would make their tires squeal in the parking garage at 3am (im pretty sure it was the same guy every night) and my room was facing the garage so i heard it loud and clear.",

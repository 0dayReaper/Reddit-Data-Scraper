            "comment": "If money isn\u2019t an issue then FSU. In literally every way possible. Even in athletics Auburn doesn\u2019t compare anymore lol, but FSU is just simply measurably a better school. \n\nIf you are however an Alabama resident and it would be cheaper to go to Auburn then go there. IMO better to be as debt-free as possible, especially as a pre-med where school choice barely matters unless you\u2019re at like a t20",

            "comment": "You're asking in a FSU sub so maybe the answers are a bit biased :)\n\nIt's a tough call.  We live in Birmingham Alabama and my daughter had the option of going tuition free to UA (didn't even visit) or to Auburn for \\~$3K a year tuition.  Then she got an offer with out of state tuition from FSU in the last month (\\~$6k a year tuition).  \n\nI'm biased, because I'm a FSU grad, but surprisingly I think my daughter may pick FSU.  Her decision is based on name recognition, wanting to get out of Alabama, and a path to doctoral studies.  Taking my garnet colored glasses off, FSU may be marginally better ranked in some areas, but they're close enough to where what you put into it will determine what you get out of it.",

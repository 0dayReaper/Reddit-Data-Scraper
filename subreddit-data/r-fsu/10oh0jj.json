What kind of scale is this thing? Volunteers aren't skilled workers. They aren't the ones catering or handling sound equipment. Or at least they shouldn't be. So I'm curious what exactly they'd be expected to do.",

The $15 is in order to background check every person attending the event in an attempt to guarantee the participants safety. My focus is on getting people to volunteer as buddies in hopes that no prom attendees are turned away. I don\u2019t know anything about the other volunteer jobs, I attend as a buddy/caregiver.

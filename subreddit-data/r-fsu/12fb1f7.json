Essentially there was only one option available for each meal in terms of protein/veg/carbs. However, people did sometimes pretend to be vegetarian to snag the vegetarian option (they always had one different meal for vegetarians only and it was limited because they don\u2019t have that much of it). There\u2019s a place called the Sweet Shop literally right next door with decent food for pretty cheap though. \nThe schedule was classes M/W/F, IRP T/T, trips/activities for the entire camp on Saturday.",

You should do whichever you think you will enjoy the most and whatever most aligns with what you want to do in the future. IDK what your county internship would entail, but if you want a job in government in the future that might be a better match than PROMYS, or if you want a career in research FSU YSP might be the best choice.",

    "postText": "Hi, I have enrolled in classes over Summer C (10 credits hours), which comes together to a total charge of $2,182.00, which includes $26.50 in fees for materials etc.\n\nHowever, my upcoming 2023 Summer C Bright Futures award shows as a much smaller number, only $1,281.30, which is the same amount I received last year for 6 credit hours during 2022 Summer B (roughly $213 per credit hour).\n\nIs the award broken up into 2022-2023/2023-2024 (and I just need to wait), or is this an error?\n\nI have no eligibility issues with BF, and I have above a 3.0 GPA.",

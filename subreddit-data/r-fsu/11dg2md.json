    "postText": "I\u2019m going to be in tallahassee all of summer due to my on-campus job and I\u2019ve decided to take classes this summer. I am a sophomore currently and as of this semester I will be done with my bio 2 + lab requirements. I was thinking of taking physics a but it looks like the only lecture available is completely filled up. My only other option I was thinking of was genetics but it\u2019s only offered in the B term and seems like hell \ud83d\ude05 any suggestions? I\u2019ve already taken orgo 1 and I\u2019m currently in orgo 2 so those credits will be done as well",

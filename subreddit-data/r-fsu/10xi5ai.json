I know that I will need to bring in 3x copies of the lead sheet for the judges, but will I be able to also bring in sheet music of the exact music I will be playing?\n\nI know it sounds kind of dumb as jazz is all about improvisation, but I am a little nervous about auditioning and I am afraid that I will mess up what I had planned to play with just lead sheets.",

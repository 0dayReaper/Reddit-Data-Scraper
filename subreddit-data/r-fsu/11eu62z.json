    "postText": "Hey everyone, i was denied admission to FSU for Fall 2023. I will be graduating with an AA from MDC this semester. I have 7 W and 3 F. My current GPA not counting this semester that hasn't finished yet is 2.33. I received 19 transfer credits from the Army. And i am retaking 2 classes for 2 of those Fs which i have received an A on already. Before the Army I clearly wasn't the best student but half way through this current semester iv proved to myself that college is a lot easier than I thought.. maybe my maturity went up. Any ways, i applied for FIU for the summer and hopefully i get admitted. Do you think an appeal sometime in the summer would be worth a shot to try and get in for Fall 2023 or should i continue at FIU and then apply for Spring 2024. Getting into FSU is not only a goal but a dream just like the Army was for me.",

Best of luck. Also talk to someone in admissions about what your should do in the mean time and next year at FIU in order to have a better chance.",

In most programs at FSU, they kick you out if you get even 1 F, and make you change majors. Sometimes you get a second chance. But 3 F's is going to be hard to explain. \n\nGo to FIU and see if you can get that GPA up before trying again.",

Legally, Florida had a matriculation policy that if you have a AA from a Florida College they have to admit you to one of the 12  Universities.\n\nAt FIU or wherever you end up, you have to pull A's;  especially in your history classes.\n\nAfter 2 semesters,  hopefully with a 3.75 or above, make an appointment with the History department chairperson , (right now that is Dr Jennifer L. Koslow, but that could change in a year.)\n\nDrive to Tallahassee.  See  her/him in person, not over phone calls and emails.  It's hard to tell someone \"No\" in person. It's easy to say \"No\" in an email.  Tell her you want to do research for FSU's Institute on World War II &amp; the Human Experience.\n\nBecause you need to be interested in working on a program FIU doesn't have or offer.\n\nExplain honestly your own academic journey and how the Army gave you maturity.\n\nGood luck. I'm pulling for you.",

If you will earn your AA before attending FSU it's as simple as meeting the GPA requirements and having completed every prerequisite for the major your applying for, if you miss one criteria you will get denied, otherwise, acceptance is seamless. Transferring is not at all competitive, expect for a very small amount of majors, history is not one of them.

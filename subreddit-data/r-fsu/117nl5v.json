            "comment": "Friend lives there now! It really depends on your classes for how far of a walk you'll have, but it's a p good location in general. Near restaurants and grocery stores, and if you like house parties there's a lot in the neighborhood next to it. The main complaint is the wifi, it's not great and cuts out so maybe plan on hanging out on campus if you have a lot of studying to do or have online classes lol. Pretty spacious apartment and not a very loud complex, rarely hear people outside or above, and if you have a car there's p much always parking spots, idk how much it costs tho. Hope this helped :)))",

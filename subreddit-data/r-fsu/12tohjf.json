    "postText": "Hello!  I was accepted into FSU's hospitality program for the fall.  I am transferring from TCC, but my GPA this semester is not great.  Right now I'm looking at two B's and one C.  Will my acceptance be rescinded?   I have an overall good GPA with TCC (I was duel enrolled through high school), but I'm taking all math/science courses this semester and they're not my strength.  It's still possible I might get an A, but most likely 2 B's and a C.  Any advice/answers are greatly appreciated.",

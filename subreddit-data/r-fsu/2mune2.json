The whole essence of being a Florida State Seminole is to be unconquered by helping and supporting each other. A lot of people were in that library tonight and what happened tonight will be something they will never forget, we've got to be there for them. After all it could have been any of us. Stay safe Noles. ",

Sad news to wake up to. Oddly enough, I even had plans to swing by \"Club Stroz\" (do people still say that?) during my upcoming visit to Tally this weekend. =(",

They're not saying anything about the shooter's weapon, how the shooter accessed the building, where the shooter was shot and killed, nor how the incident began. No other threats at this time.\n\nThey have scheduled a 6AM press conference which will be the next time you will hear any official updates. I recommend tuning into a local news station then.\n\n~~Im uploading video to YT now.~~ EDIT: it's a 20 min video so it's taking forever.

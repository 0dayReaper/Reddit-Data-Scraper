    "postText": "Hi all-\nI\u2019m a professor at FSU. I\u2019ve been asked for advice by a few of my students and two of them said I should share it here. I also have two children in college. My daughter just finished her first year in graduate school in New York, and my son just finished his sophomore year in Texas. They have heard all of this as well, and my daughter has edited this to make me sound a little less like an old man. (How do you do, fellow kids?)\n\nI am not speaking on behalf of FSU. \n\nFirst of all, this advice may not be good for you. Everyone is different and experiencing all that is going now uniquely, and what I have suggested for my students and kids might not be the right thing for you. You may have people in your life that could offer you sound advice. If you need it, ask for it.\n\nSecond, I\u2019m biased. I\u2019m a college professor and I like college, and I like students so I have certain ideas that bias towards people being in school. Refer back to the last point.\n\nThird, I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by FSU\u2019s reaction and plans through this ordeal so far. They are being more measured and cautious than many other places. Schools that have said they are definitely going back to normal in the Fall are really gambling with their reputation.\n\nOK so the thing I\u2019d like to address first is last semester. \n\nLike all of you, I found out we were going completely online on March 17th, when it was announced during Spring Break. So I had until the next Monday to get all of my courses online, AND get my daughter from NYC, AND get my son home from Texas. Needless to say, my online courses were not the greatest example of online education. If I taught summer school, I\u2019d probably gotten a little bit better at it, but it\u2019s still not enough prep time to take courses online. **So don\u2019t use the Spring semester as an example of online content delivery. It will be much better in the fall.**\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the Fall. \n\nMy department head has suggested we prepare our old and new classes for regular face-to-face delivery, online only delivery, and a mix of online and face-to-face. So I\u2019m spending my unpaid summer break doing that prep with my usual courses and the two new courses I\u2019m teaching in the fall.\n\nMy son wants to take a gap year. \n\nHe said he had a hard time learning with online courses. I ask what will you do? It\u2019s not like you can backpack through Europe, especially if the expected second wave hits. You might not be able to find a job if things get rough again, it may go back to essential only. His point about learning online bothers me a bit, too. When you apply for a job after you graduate and they ask why you took a gap year, it may not sound great to say \u201cbecause I can't learn online\u201d since so many companies and institutions use computer based courses for training. I think a taking a gap year would be a mistake. If school goes back to normal, you\u2019ll be behind a year. If things go wonkier with the Corona, etc\u2026 you may get bored. Depression bored. Also, check out the stats of students that don\u2019t ever come back to college after taking a year off. It\u2019s disheartening.\n\nMy son\u2019s school has a big sports program. \nHuge. If you can believe it, bigger than FSU. My son is a tech guy, studying some interesting, cutting edge stuff. He\u2019s never been to a sporting event at his school except when we came down to visit and see a football game. He (actually me) has to pay a large fee for athletics every semester, even though he doesn\u2019t partake in any of the activities, and couldn\u2019t care less about them. We will have to pay them next year, even if they don\u2019t play a game. Same with libraries (which my son utilizes at school and online), parking fees (even though he doesn\u2019t have a car), and various other extra fees. You may likely wonder why you are still being charged fees when you aren\u2019t on campus (if we go online). These are part of the expenses of the school that occur all of the time. It\u2019s the cost of the University. The parking and maintenance staff don\u2019t disappear when the students do, so we have to pay for them. We may see budget cuts eventually. Don\u2019t worry, they won\u2019t cut from athletics or from facilities, they\u2019ll cut academic programs. Sorry I got a little dark there.\n\nAs for housing- that\u2019s more complicated. Both of my kids live off campus and will return to their respective cities in August. If my son knew he were only taking online classes, he would probably stay here in town. His school has\u2019t announced their plans either. His school\u2019s town has predatory off-campus housing contracts much like Tallahassee, so we will pay rent for him regardless if he goes back or stays, just like we did this Spring.\n\nCampus is a ghost town without students. I hope we will all be able to be a community again soon. Please be safe and make informed, smart decisions in the next year.",

I appreciate all the work being made from faculty and staff but if I can put in a word, I think the problem your son and many of us students had wasn\u2019t only the classes being online. The main issue was that classes were treated as normal face-to-face online classes on zoom and that was frustrating for most of us since everything that was going on we did not want/maybe couldn\u2019t be tied to a specific time anymore because of various responsibilities. I know when I went back home, I had to help around the house and family like taking my mom to work but trying to make sure to be back for my 10 am class. Just being locked into a online live lecture class also doesn\u2019t really help students learn. Many students have already taken a online class before all of this, and the way they were handled before is by giving the content through PowerPoints and lecture videos, without a time to meet or zoom lectures. Giving the responsibility to the students but it allows flexibility as well. I know this message is long but I am hoping as you are a professor,  if you can voice some of our concerns to other faculty and staff. Thank you again for your advice and consideration. /u/BearsYeetsBSG",

He had a 9am class so he had to get up very early for the time difference. \nBe aware that the faculty may not have much say in the timing of their classes. If we have online classes, the University may push for more synchronous classes (that meet during the actual class times) to try and give some sense of normalcy and structure to students. If you are unable to do this, you may ask your instructors beforehand if they will hold synchronous or asynchronous classes, and then adjusts this Fall\u2019s schedule to best suit you. This is only temporary, and hopefully we will be back to face-to-face soon.",

I don't think a student making a personal decision to take a break from online classes in the face of a global pandemic is a negative reflection on their work ethic or character, and any student who makes the decision to hold off until in-person classes are available again absolutely should not volunteer that information to their employer. It's simply a bad reason to not take a gap year.\n\nEverything you said about being bored and the lack of jobs is true, though, and I agree. I just don't want students who are stressed out by the prospect of a fully-online semester to be misled into thinking they have to spill their guts to potential employers.",

            "comment": " Thank you so much for taking the time to make this post! Insight from professors, especially those with children currently attending college, is so valuable and much appreciated!!\n My daughter, our only child, will be returning to FSU in the fall as a sophomore. Her major is Clinical Professions, as her dream since middle school, is to become a surgeon. Like so many countless parents, we have found navigating through this past year a bit challenging. I expect this next year will  have plenty of challenges as well.\n In the meantime, please know that I have no doubt that I speak for many parents when I say thank you for all that do for our students! Thank you for all of the unpaid hours of work! Thank you for your dedication and most of all, thank you for caring! \n Many blessings to you and your family!\nSincerely,\nCatherine \nPS For what it\u2019s worth, I think a gap year is a big mistake as well. Hope your son heeds your wisdom!",

Part of the reason I go to FSU is that I love sports, and it\u2019s something that makes an enormous amount of money for the facilities you and I probably would happily pay for.",

I broke down that cost, roughly, meaning that for the fall semester which is only around 3 months makes it close to 1250 a month to live in a shoe box with people you might not even stand or get along with!!! I COULD PAY THAT MUCH FOR A ONE BED ONE BATH APARTMENT AAAA WHY DID I DO THIS TO MYSELF AGAIN!!!!!! aaAAAAAAAAA \ud83d\ude2d",

Paying a years worth of rent at $1250 will total in $15,000 for the year, while paying for a dorm for the Fall and Spring semesters is less than half that price. Granted, you could sublet for the Summer, but you\u2019re still paying over $10,000 total for Fall and Spring at an apartment (one where rent is $1250). Dorms also don\u2019t charge utilities or parking or anything. Lastly, dorms can often foster community and help new students get familiar with campus, not to mention the proximity to classes/dining halls which removes the need for transportation or gas costs.\n\nAnyways, I totally get you that it may not feel worth it some times, but it\u2019s definitely up to the individual and what they prioritize. I personally live in an apartment now and it\u2019s so worth it to me to have my own space, but cost wise, I\u2019m in a 2x2 and still pay over $10,000 total for the year in rent while a dorm probably wouldn\u2019t break $8,000 total. Lots of pros of dorms, but month to month costs can be misleading of the overall value.",

At fsu if somethings broken in my dorm, I know it will be fixed within 24 hours of me submitting a ticket, sometimes less. If I see bugs I fill out a form and exterminators come without me even knowing, compared to some off campus dorms having bad bug problems, or having or argue with the property managers to fix anything.\n\nAlso not saying safety is an issue, but if anything were to happen, I feel safe on campus.",

Having lived 4 years on campus during undergrad, they are: no hassle of parking, safe, good community (debatable on some freshmen dorms, true). Pretty much all of them have been renovated in the past 5 years (for example, some UF dorms *still* have A/C window units). I get that sharing a room with a stranger must feel very different, but it is a good lesson on how to get along with someone, especially if they don't like you (my freshman roommate was a jerk but not everyone in life you meet will be rainbows and sunshine). \n\nRoughly assuming 4 months per semester, and using your figure for semester costs, that brings the monthly cost to 936.25. To compare, I am paying 817.00 for a 2/2 at GrandMarc with a utility bill of 50-80 a month. So that's basically 880-900 a month, which isn't too below your price. And my place is on the cheaper side. There are upsides and downsides to your choice of domicile. \n\nI will offer two pieces of advice. One, be grateful that you have a place to live. And two, be sure to always do some research when it comes to housing and/or big financial decisions. I hope your stay in whatever dorm is as pleasant as my 4 years were.",

And as someone else said they are 100% inclusive. Plus you can walk out your door to class. Dorms 100% have tons of benefits.   \n\n\nThe average new apartment that close to campus runs at basically minimum 900+ a month before utilities, parking or any other fees. Heck there are tons with spots listed at more than a dorm costs as well.   \n\n\nThere are some good places a block or two away but then who knows if your room mate is even a student. The only place I have found off campus that seems solid is technically still on campus and that is Heritage Grove. It counts as campus so everyone living there has to be an FSU student and they include all utilities and internet. I signed a few months ago and my rent for my room is going to be 849 all inclusive, and free parking.   \n\n\nWith that said pretty much most of my friends at FSU currently I can tie back to my dorm my first summer term.

It's called 'missed meal factor' and they price their meal plans around the anticipated amount of purchased but unused meals they sell.\n\nI began my career in food service management with a dining provider on a college campus. They're all scummy in their own way, but self-operated dining programs are often \\*more\\* costly to students with as good or worse service/food.",

Pretty nice ones range from $1400-1500, and with utilities, you are only paying around $800 a month per person. Especially if you are taking summer courses.",

In the suite style halls you don\u2019t really have much control over the temperature though.  In the apartment style halls you have a little more control over the temperature, especially the newer ones like Ragans and Traditions.  Rogers and McCollum and Salley halls have the least control of the AC though.",

The new apartment complex down the road charged a little over 1K per bedroom (granted they got free food trucks once a week etc).",

All the above should cover tuition and dorm cost. She wants to join a sorority and if there is leftover financial aid , would she be able to apply to the sorority dues ? \nI don\u2019t know how all these funds are disbursed.\nSorry if this is a stupid question, I\u2019m a single mom , never attended college and don\u2019t know how it all works .",

I live a very blessed life, so I have 4 years of Florida prepaid, 3 years of bright futures, full pell grant, and a few other small scholarships. After about a month into my first semester I received a direct deposit into my bank account, followed by a second deposit about two weeks later. Assuming it\u2019ll be the same for your daughter, she will have that money as cash that can be spent on whatever or whenever. She should be able to pay for sorority dues with that. \n\nIf you have any question about how to link her bank account to FSU pet me know and I\u2019ll try and provide links. \n\nIf it is official that she is attending here, then she will also find out more information during her time at orientation that will help her connect her bank to FSU financial aid refunds. \n\n\nThat\u2019s about it, and congratulations on being a \u2018Nole mom! \n\nTldr: Short answer, yes. She should be able to use left over money for sorority dues",

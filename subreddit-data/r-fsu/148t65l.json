    "postText": "I got accepted to the honors college with an OOS waiver that I really need and one of the conditions to keep it is maintaining a 3.0. I was valedictorian of my high school class and take my work very seriously but I have heard endlessly about how much harder college is and how I\u2019m destined to get like a 2.6 my first semester because of the adaptation. I also go to a small and not great school so I\u2019m afraid the rigor is just going to blow me away.",

And the change in class structure where in your gen Ed\u2019s you can just disappear, so people skip too much and flunk out or think they just have to show up for the three exams that make up your entire class grade. I was scared of dropping below the 3.0 for honors college, but I never did. Just be sure to hold yourself accountable for your work.",

The B-range is pretty easy to hit with most professors. Curves tend to be pretty good, especially in harder classes. Everyone is math makes mistakes so profs care more on whether you show that you know the theory or process rather than if you got the right answer. Go to class, read the material, practice a bit, and you'll be fine. Good luck friend!",

    "postText": "I just found out I didn't pass one of my classes, AST 1005, I  got a D+, but I needed a C- to pass the course. This is supposed to cover my natural science requirement. But I am also taking MET 1050. Will this be able to make up for the natural science, or will I have to retake a natural science class next semester?\n\nI'm stressing out and would like to know so I can prepare for the next registration, thanks",

Passing D grades just don't count towards meeting general education requirements.\n\nIf you want to verify what courses will satisfy a given requirement, a good place to start is the liberal studies course search page:\nhttp://liberalstudiescourses.fsu.edu/care/LS-courses/course-display.php",

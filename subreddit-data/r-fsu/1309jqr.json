In most units you will find leaking faucets, the trimming on chairs are coming off, sometimes floorboards are a little misplaced. It\u2019s not fancy but it\u2019s better than having no arrangements at all. You only pay for electricity here, and for me it ranges anywhere between $30-$90 (split between 3) depending on the season. And as the other comment said, there is no in-unit laundry, but there is a small communal laundry building where you pay $2 per machine you use.",

If you want to see more apts, Whitehall is similar to pavilion in terms of layout and rent, and they are just across the street from us. Good luck on your apartment search, I really do think that university village is the cheapest you\u2019ll get for apts so close to fsu",

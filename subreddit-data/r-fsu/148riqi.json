            "comment": "If your fundamentals are sound, it's not hard. People don't fail calculus because of the calculus. It's just a fairly small grab-bag of rules to learn and their application is straightforward. ***They fail it because of algebra***. Drill your basics and you'll be fine (Khan Academy is what I used when I had to knock a lot of rust off).",

You probably took precal/trig already, but how long ago and how much do you still remember? \n\nIt's gonna be difficult if you can't even remember factoring and adding fractions.",

    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m currently waiting to get approved for my dual degree once grades drop. I am hoping to take summer classes for my new major but I can\u2019t register now since I\u2019m not in the major officially. I was told by the coordinator it might take 3-5 days after May 10th. I was wondering if I would still be able to register for classes during drop-add (as it begins May 13) or if I have to have atleast one class registered to be able to apply for classes.\n\nSorry, if this isn\u2019t the smartest question, I tried asking advisors but they didn\u2019t explain so well.",

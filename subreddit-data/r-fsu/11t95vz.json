I had a roommate that put he didn\u2019t smoke or drink on it, and he was actually a drug dealer who smoked 10x a day and was drunk 24/7. Apparently his parents were watching him fill out the form. He was pretty cool though.\n\nI\u2019ve had 8 randomly assigned roommates, 5 were great and 3 were terrible. May the odds be ever in your favor.",

I got a monster who filled our room with moldy food and slept actually all day long but complained when we (triple) were in the room or had lights on when she was asleep. She also stole my stuff and bullied my boyfriend about his minor speech impediment. Covid hit and one of the perks is that I was rid of her 3 months early :) If you have a friend you can dorm with I\u2019d recommend trying to do that, the other girl in my triple was an acquaintance from HS and we got along great.",

This was fall of 2020, so we had a lot of time to bond due to COVID. We ended up not living together afterwards bc she was graduating shortly.\n\nMy second year, I moved into a 4x4 with my close friend from my hometown and two randoms. It was fine for the first few months, and then it all went downhill. My friend was hated by one other girl in the apartment and she made sure my friend knew. It was hell and eventually my friend moved back home. Unfortunately, I was the next target and was essentially bullied out a year later. \n\nI\u2019m in my third/last year here and I live alone with my cat. And it\u2019s been nothing but fucking perfect. Random roommates can go rlly well for most people, but those questionnaires are absolutely useless. Everybody knows what to put down to get the cleaner, nicer, and quieter roommates but they never actually use those questionnaires much. \nFor the most part, everyone I know here in Tally has had a shit roommate(s) at one point in time so that\u2019s something you should always consider.",

We were in Gilchrist in room 001 that had 3 people in one regular dorm connect by a hallway to another smaller room for one person. It was weird but great because we\u2019re still all pretty decent friends now though we don\u2019t see the other guy too much in person these days. Year 2 I am in McCollum with the same HS friend and the other two roommates are good aside from being kind of unkept in terms of bathroom cleanliness (long hair everywhere from one of them). We don\u2019t talk to them too much, but the interactions we have had have been great. Next year I\u2019m in ragans and it\u2019s with randoms, we\u2019ll see how it goes",

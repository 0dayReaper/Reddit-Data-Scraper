That's the dilema, at $750 that's only about $1500 more than dorms for a year so not a difficult choice. I take it you got your lease before other students went through dorm selection? They are probably taking advantage of the students that didn't get assigned a dorm.",

But I do think this location for fsu is top tier, so I would try checking out the other apartments along west call street like The Luxe on West Call, White Hall Apartments, University Village, Seminole Flatts, etc. i don\u2019t know what their prices or amenities are but you should give them a shot!",

The other places being looked at Eclipse and Yugo are in the same range as well. Checking out White Hall and University Village, thanks!",

Also the magic word for talking to the leasing office is sublease which means you would be basically taking over a lease from someone who is trying to get out of a lease or no longer has a roommate.  If you fail there, just call the leasing offices at the apartments that are along the Seminole Express bus lines or the regular bus lines.  Your FSU card is a bus pass that lets you ride any of the routes at no additional cost (you pay for it through some of your FSU fees).  Good luck!",

You aren't homeless, that is offensive to people who actually couldn't afford somewhere to live. \n\nMany students live off campus and don't have a car. If you live close you can walk, invest $100 into a bike which thousands of students have, get a scooter or whatever you want to facilitate transport.\n\nThere are also busses. In terms of going back and forth, you don't have to do that. You know people successfully go to jobs, class, and whatever else they need without returning home every few hours.\n\nPack your own lunch. You will have a locker. If you need to use the dining hall it is quite close to the music building.\n\nAgain, i don't understand why you need to go back and forth any more than the 40,000 other students at FSU who regularly have 15 minutes to get from one corner of campus to the other.",

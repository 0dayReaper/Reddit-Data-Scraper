First time this happened to me but I cannot see the Canvas Course (class is online) and I cannot for the life of me find any emails or contact info to notify the instructor that I don't have access to the course page. What should I do? Class is:  **CDA 3100 - 0006\u00a0\u00a0 Computer Organization I**  in case anyone else from the class is having the same issue.",

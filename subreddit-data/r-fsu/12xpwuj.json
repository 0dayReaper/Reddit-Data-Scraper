    "postText": "Hey y'all,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been trying to get my five tickets for the May 5th 7pm commencement. First, the web site wouldn't let me finish purchasing the tickets, so I had to wait for a response from the Civic Center (had to clear cache, if anyone else has this problem). Now, the web site won't let me purchase five tickets - it caps at 4. I've been trying to get these tickets for the last five days and now I can't get a response via email nor phone call. Has anyone had this problem or know who I can contact directly? I have 5 people coming from out of town for this and leaving one out is not really an option.",

    "postText": "I heard that the Sally\u2019s dorm was bad but looking the the pictures each bedroom has one bed and a shared bath. Would this be the single suite with shared bath as opposed to the double? Also what other dorms would you recommend instead I\u2019m going to be studying psychology.",

            "comment": "hi, ex salley resident. no, it is not one bedroom and a shared bath. the pictures make it seem like it is, but i think they were going for a bunked bed look. the layout is when you walk in, there is a common room with all of your desks in it, and a bathroom off of the common room. then, two rooms with two beds each in it. so it\u2019s one bathroom for 4 residents. salley is the only dorm like this. \n\nin all of the other dorms (minus the apartment style ones), the bathroom is just in between those two rooms, there is no common room, but the rooms are A LOT bigger. \n\ni ride for salley, but it was only because i had a great roommate. a random bad roommate makes any dorm not great, but probably even worse in a smaller area. \n\nsalley is great as it\u2019s by the psych building, but to be honest, you\u2019re going to have classes all over campus. \n\ni suggest dorman/deviney. they are nice, new, social but not as crazy as magnolia/azalea, and have a good location. it\u2019s a walk to psych, but not a walk to anything else. wildwood is also nice if you have a higher contract number and can\u2019t get dorman/deviney. \n\nlet me know if you have any other questions :)",

I\u2019ve also heard that Broward and rodgers are good, although I can\u2019t testify as I\u2019ve never been in them. I was in McCollum once and it seemed nice as well.",

My roommate and I had ours separate and there wasn't much space between them but we were pretty close so it wasn't too bad. The common room is definitely a plus, especially if you tend to study late since your roommates can go to sleep and you can still study without disturbing them. It's also the cheapest option if that's a consideration for you.",

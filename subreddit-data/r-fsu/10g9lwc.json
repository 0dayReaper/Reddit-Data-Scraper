    "postText": "I live at Legacy Student Living and this morning found out someone had stolen my catalytic converter from under my car. Obviously there isn\u2019t much preventative measures students can take, but I wanted to make everyone aware that it was happening in the area in case they wanted to increase security around their cars (somehow). Stealing converters is apparently becoming rather common as of last year.",

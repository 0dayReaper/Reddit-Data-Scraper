Throughout my degree, I\u2019ve really enjoyed coding and think it will fit my career goals well. I am wondering how long a BA in Computer Science will take given that I already have the math requirements, will test out of Spanish, and have my humanities-related minor mostly done.",

            "comment": "Assuming you haven't taken the first programming at FSU, it would take 4 semesters at minimum. You can look up FSU computer science BA flowchart to see what classes and what order they should be taken. For the main courses of CS, I wouldn't recommend taking them out of order. CS electives prereqs usually don't matter too much, except if it says Data Structures II (basically programming 3) is required. If you have taken the first programming class, it would be 3 semesters minimum.",

Given how far along you are and just generally needing the CS classes and electives, it's doable but it would be extremely tough for the last semester. Most people break the last level down to two semesters because of how tough and demanding the classes, so 4 semesters.",

This is considering that I would like a more tech related role such as software engineering. Additionally do you think that having the MIS degree would give me greater leverage for employability and salary negotiation in addition to the BA CS degree. Thanks!",

I'm getting a degree in BS, but in reality and from everything I have seen applying to jobs and internships myself, as well as what others have said online, there really doesn't seem to be that much of a difference to employers regarding BS and BA, as long as you have a degree. At FSU, the BS comes with a collateral minor (I believe in interdisciplinary science or something, I forget what it's called, basically a minor from the shit ton of math and science the BS requires). With a BA, you have more freedom to choose what minor you want, or as you are doing currently, works well with another major. Now, I can't say what crossover an MIS degree and CS looks like to an employer, but I'm sure it wouldn't hurt to have two degrees. I also don't really know the grad school process, but I imagine that grades are the most important aspect. Regardless, having the degree and any potential experience are the bulk of what appeals to employers. So if CS interests you, I say go for the BA if it's financially possible! And when it comes to electives, just try to balance classes that interest you and are not going to kill your GPA, especially if you want to go to grad school.",

So if you do a double major, the actual coursework is doable in 4 semesters, but i would strongly recommend taking 5 (do programming 1 + intro to unix over the summer, online if you can). Problem is you cant start taking most electives till after your second semester in the degree track finishes, so youll have very little to do for the first 2 semesters, and a ton to do in the next 2-3.",

Unfortunately though, I will be done with my MIS coursework by Spring of 2024 (not accounting for a potential internship), so I would only have two semesters to graduate on time. This means I would have to extend my graduation time by an extra 2-3 semesters no matter what. For this reason I\u2019m considering switching to the BA CS.",

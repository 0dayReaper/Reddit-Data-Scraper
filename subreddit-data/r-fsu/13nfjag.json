    "postText": "Florida has been seeing so much devastating legislation being passed that can\u2019t all be discussed in one post, but I specifically wanted to ask ab the effect of the higher education ones (like hb999 and sb266) on classes. Idk if these are dumb questions but I\u2019ve been looking everywhere and can\u2019t find this specific info ab these.\n\nSo will all classes (electives and higher level) discussing crt, gender, intersectionality etc. probably be banned or just gen ed classes that include these topics?\n\nLike I want to minor in political philosophy and some of the classes include philosophy of race, class and gender, marxist philosophy, and philosophy of feminism. Will all these classes probably be removed or can they stay bc they\u2019re higher level and can be taken as electives (bc of the changes to sb266)? Is this minor and others in the social sciences at risk? Ik these are pretty specific questions and maybe there aren\u2019t answers yet (+ it depends on future review) but I\u2019d appreciate any input ab what y\u2019all think.",

            "comment": "In the short term, you should be fine. If those are elective classes for your program, SB 266 will not affect you. But if you want to take them as gen ed, you wouldn't be able to on paper. Thus if you have credit from high school to get gen ed out of the way quickly, I would take those elective classes as early as possible.\n\nLong term it is a bit tricky, not because of the gen ed restrictions, but because of the control the board of trustees would have on faculty. If faculty leave because of the new policies, they would very likely be replaced by faculty who acquiesce to right-wing which would not help you at all.\n\nThis is from my understanding of SB 266, and this is mostly speculation. I would recommend reading the bill for yourself and making a decision best for you. Here is the [bill](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/266/BillText/er/HTML), and the new stuff that is relevant is underlined fyi.",

My assumption is departments that want to continue providing critical theory coursework will not be so open about it on their course descriptions. I suggest you talk to the professors and graduate students in your department, they may know which courses are changing.",

The bills you reference remove the topics you discussed from general education courses not upper level electives. The bill also does not prohibit many principles required for federal grants. However, in future years the legislature or the DOE may make changes limiting options for classes that center around CRT, DEI etc. But they wont pull the rug out from under you mid degree. After a certain freshmen cohort those degrees may become unavailable.",

Anyone else having this problem, or is there a place I can check to see if I have a minor assigned or something?\n\n*Update* Seems to be a problem with the mobile version of the site, one option wasn\u2019t appearing to me so I couldn\u2019t answer it or submit. lol",

If it's the university one, minors have nothing to do with that since it only checks for university requirements - if submitting that is giving an error message, it's probably just a system error because of how busy it is today with registration opening for juniors.",

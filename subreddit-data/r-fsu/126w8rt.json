    "postText": "I just switched my major to Linguistics and Languages, and I would love some advice from anyone who has taken the classes already! I plan to take LIN 3041 over the summer, and then take LIN 4040, 4021, and 4623 in the Fall Semester. Is there anything I should know about these classes or anything I should do to prepare? Thanks :)",

The teachers vary greatly, you\u2019ll get some nice ones, some funny ones, some helpful ones.\n\nBrush up on some linguistics terminology beforehand, and I recommend studying IPA as soon as possible, even if your classes don\u2019t teach them.\n\nWhat are the specific names of classes? Sorry, I don\u2019t know their numbers. I could give better information if I do.\n\nI also do need to warn you, the linguistics program is VERY half-baked at the moment. They started offering the major recently and so far each semester has a hodgepodge of classes, so I recommend supplementing with your elective credits.",

                            "comment": "Intro to Linguistics is interesting, and great for letting yourself see if it\u2019s your speed. Usually a bigger class than you\u2019ll see in Linguistics. Mine was taught by Prantil, but there\u2019s another professor or two that do it as well. Unless they put it back to TWO classes, intro to linguistics is PACKED with information that will be integral to and explored further in higher classes. I definitely suggest knowing some IPA before hand, only the common English ones. \n\nSounds of the world\u2019s languages is probably run by Bates. I did that one, I will say, it is complex and requires some use of softwares, so paying attention is important. The teacher is kind and funny, but he didn\u2019t post PowerPoints and his final exams were tough! Please make sure you buy the books early in the semester and READ the chapters. It\u2019s also misleading, as you don\u2019t spend TOO much time actually learning about other language\u2019s sounds so much as acoustics itself. By time you get to that semester, you might want to brush up on IPA of other languages, cuz it will be taught quickly and quizzed on often. \n\nI believe I know who teaches psycho-linguistics of bilingualism. That one, you might have some gaps, especially because most teachers are running with a high knowledge of Spanish (or Italian, in Prantil\u2019s case). If you like psychology and how the mind works, it\u2019ll likely be pretty fun. AFAIK, linguistics doesn\u2019t go too much into the neuroscience, so it shouldn\u2019t be too rough. \n\nI can\u2019t say I know the other one and I didn\u2019t look up who the professor is. \n\nMostly importantly, most of the students in linguistics are cool as heck, and none the teacher\u2019s are too too aggressive. Let the Intro guide you and know that it branches out into other topics, like compsci or psychology. \n\nI can answer any other specific questions, if you have any. \n\nAlso, do you happen to take a Chinese class this semester?",

Just had a few questions to those that are familiar with the distance learning program.\n\nWhat is your overall review of the program? \n\nWhat were things that you did not like(if any)? \n\nWould you recommend it?\n\nAnd finally, does the bachelors degree say \u201cdistance learning\u201d, \u201cPanama Campus\u201d, or does it just say \u201cFlorida state university\u201d like a student who attended the main campus in Tallahassee? \n\nThank you for your help!!!",

            "comment": "I'm currently enrrolled in the program. Graduating next year. The program has few professors so you will have most of your CS classes taught by the same 3-4 professors. So far, I have a good perception of all of them. I work full time and put around 12+ credits each semester. The electives I have taken so far have relevant material. Other than that, your regular OOP classes and such. I'm happy with the program. Sti got a couple of semesters to go.",

            "comment": "Context: I graduated from the B.S. in C.S. program via Distance Learning in 2019 and am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at a small IT services company. I was in the program for a long time because I was working in the industry for several years while finishing the program. Please take everything below with a grain of salt as things could have changed since I was in the program.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOverall review:\n\nA little underwhelming? But maybe my expectations were misguided. If you (like I was) are expecting to come out a fully capable software developer at the end then you are mistaken unless you put a lot of extra work in on side projects outside of courses. What you will learn is the fundamentals of programming, operating systems and databases. Admittedly there is a lot of ground to cover but the degree program really just scratches the surface. They start at a very low level... arguably lower than you really \"need\" to know. Will it make you a better dev in the long run? Maybe, but I know plenty of great devs without this knowledge too. As I said above, this may have changed though and may be the same at all unis with this program... of course a lot of this is guided by standards set higher than the uni level. Needless to say but I learned a lot more skills relevant to my day to day job by actually working in the industry than doing the program. Don't conflate this program with \"real (work) world\" experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThings I didn't like:\n\n* Lack of or inadequate exposure to more \"real (work) world\" skills like source control systems (git, TFVC, etc), cloud services (Azure and AWS), UI/UX concepts, testing frameworks, higher level programming languages, project management tools (Jira, ADO), etc.\n* Outdated course material. I saw a lot of VERY old stuff during my time. Stuff profs had been using for many years without updating/improving.\n* Lack of teacher involvement/communication/feedback. It was often like pulling teeth just to get a grade on an assignment in a reasonable timeframe, let alone actionable feedback.\n* The math. It's a pain in the ass and not very useful for many verticals. Especially the Discrete Math series: I retained very little and feel like it could be omitted from the program and the few relevant parts distributed elsewhere. But it is what it is. Consider the IT track if you don't want to deal with it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWould I recommend it?\n\nI mean I guess? For those that care the degree looks pretty good and holds some weight. But tbh a lot of places don't care about CS degrees anymore. If you are good at teaching yourself you might be just as well off (or better) doing some of the bootcamps online and building a portfolio. College degrees are becoming less common/important by the day for developers IMO.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;And finally, does the bachelors degree say \u201cdistance learning\u201d, \u201cPanama Campus\u201d, or does it just say \u201cFlorida state university\u201d like a student who attended the main campus in Tallahassee?\n\nOne last \"this may have changed over the years\", but no. My degree looks the same as an in person student who attended the main campus in Tallahassee. No mention of distance learning, a different  campus or anything like that.",

This was pre-covid though so I hope that has changed since.\n\n2. Always C++ unless the course was for a specific language.\n\n3. That was always left up to the specific individuals in the group but typically online via one of the various IM/video conferencing applications (Skype, Discord, Slack, etc).\n\n4. The replies were often helpful but sometimes not as timely as I'd like. This was heavily dependent on the professors. Some seemingly only replied to emails once a day (at best)... others were very responsive. So if you left things to the last day or two you could get into a bind.",

            "comment": "I took classes in the distance learning CS program from 2019-2022. I didn't graduate, rather I enrolled in the main campus for my master's (I already had a bachelor's in another field).\n\nWhen I first started taking classes, the program was primarily made up of and for people who were in the industry and looking to level up their credentials. That has changed, and the classes are very similar in scope and rigor to what you'd encounter on the main campus. \n\nIf you graduate, your diploma will say Florida State University. The only difference is that if you participate in a ceremony, yours' will be at the FSU-Panama City campus rather than with the College of Arts and Science folks on main campus.\n\nI found the classes I took prepared me for grad school as well as any of my classmates on main campus, so no complaints. The professors who are there now are all very good. All were very, very helpful in office hours when I had trouble getting my head around things.\n\nIt may not matter to you (entirely depends on what your financial situation is), but distance learning courses sometimes have extra fees attached that aren't covered by some scholarships. If this is you, look closely at what classes you'll be taking and if the extra charges will be painful.",

            "comment": "I just finished the first semester of discrete math and can confirm what others above indicated: could be reworked to be more current. We learned mathematical proof interpretation / writing as well as logic systems, how the RSA security algorithm works (which my understanding is will soon be obsolete as quantum computing becomes more advanced) and a section that went into more detail than necessary on big O / little o notation. On one hand it\u2019s cool that I can read mathematical hieroglyphics now, but on the other I\u2019m unsure I\u2019ll use most of it again. \n\nI think that sort of encapsulates a CS degree in a nutshell though. You get all the foundation and background you need, but it\u2019s up to you to use it and show a potential employer you\u2019re worth hiring. Instructors are responsive enough, but getting really good feedback on your code isn\u2019t really a thing. Maybe I\u2019m weird but I like seeing creative code solutions even if I don\u2019t immediately understand them all the time.  I\u2019m not sure how they can give lots of feedback with the class size they have however(at least in the intro classes. Size = about 40) \n\nFWIW I\u2019ve taken STEM courses at two other universities in FL: UNF and FIU. I\u2019d say FIU was a joke (not worth the money at all) and UNF / FSU have been about the same in terms of value and quality of instruction.",

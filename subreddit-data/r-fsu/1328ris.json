    "postText": "Hi, I am trying to get some help choosing electives for next semester. I am looking at taking either  **CIS** **4360.** **Computer Security Fundamentals** or  **CIS** **4626** **Introduction to Offensive Computer Security (3)** . So far, I have taken COP3330 and CDA3100 but not COP4530. Is CIS4360 going to be difficult for me? Any input on either classes or any other elective recommendations would be appreciated. \n\nI also was wondering if cgs 3066 would count towards an elective credit? I want to have some experience with javascript and web dev and it seems like the only class that covers that. I am also going to take Advanced Programming in Java this coming semester",

            "comment": "CGS 3066 only counts as an elective credit for people in the Computer Programming and Applications major, not Computer Science majors. However, I wouldnt recommend it even if it did count, im taking it right now and the professor just isnt good. All the course materials are recycled from another professor and are available online (you can just google FSU CGS 3066) and theres an ~14 hour youtube series on freecodecamp called Web Applications for Everybody taught by a guy named Dr Chuck that is infinitely better than anything you might learn in that class. Unfortunately if you want to learn web development in any way as a CS major at FSU you kind of just have to do it yourself.",

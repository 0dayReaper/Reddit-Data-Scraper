Florida State is known as a more academic competitive school but usf I was able to get into their honors. Thinking about bio major. What would you guys pick.\nAppreciate it",

I chose FSU even though it was lower ranked than my other options because I liked the people and culture more and could see myself being happy here. That\u2019s just as important as academics because you won\u2019t want to do schoolwork if you\u2019re miserable all four years.",

Thanks for your input. I see you being in Neuroscience. I'm thinking about going that path. Wondering is there any chance for people that aren't that academic gifted. I know I'm not retarted but don't have photographic memory that some others do have. Wondering is there even chance of making it to the biology major in fsu. I'm about top 10 percent of my graduation class at best. Appreciate it \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

The classes aren\u2019t cutthroat like some other schools, so people are willing to form study groups and help each other out. Classes are pretty standard and you have a wide range of electives to choose from. If you go to a smaller school, you won\u2019t have as much choice and might be stuck with professors you don\u2019t like but can\u2019t avoid. There is also something for everyone here, so outside of classes you can party or do sports stuff if you want, but I\u2019ve never actually been to a football game or a party. It\u2019s totally avoidable. Instead, I joined some school clubs and play video games with my friends and go hiking.\n\nThe cons are pretty subjective. Some people don\u2019t like Tallahassee, but that\u2019s just a case of visiting and seeing for yourself. It\u2019s a little isolating if you don\u2019t have your own car, but I haven\u2019t had one all four years I\u2019ve been here and still do plenty outside of campus. Some class sizes are giant, so you have to be your own motivator. You won\u2019t have a professor checking in on you or helping you if you\u2019re struggling unless you seek them out and tell them.",

Come here \u2764\ufe0fmuch better atmosphere, SAFER, and resources are so much better, and school is more like a school. USF feels like (is) a commuter school so the sense of community in academics is somewhat weak. Also I met many of the honors college kids and they were all in the same stem classes and labs as me but paying more and were miserable with their honors specific electives. if you want more info PM me",

    "postText": "So I really do want to learn Japanese, as I'm planning on going on a trip once I graduate. Though while I do want to learn it, I'm worried that the fact it might affect my GPA with a grade may take away my motivation to actually want to learn if it's a requirement. I thought about doing Pass/Fail, but I'm worried if I fail it it'll look bad on a masters application (when I'm already having some bad blotches on my transcript as it is). So should I still go for it? Another point is that I need 3 more credits to be counted as a full-time student, so I'm back and forth on it.",

            "comment": "As someone who took classes in two separate languages at FSU, it\u2019s not the GPA that would take your motivation away, it would be the fact that it\u2019s *a class*. A lot of people become less likely to do something if it\u2019s for a class. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about, I could see it happening regardless of whether or not you take it pass/fail. You might be better off finding an independent tutor and studying on your own in the meantime. \n\nThat being said, if you\u2019re truly motivated to learn, then you\u2019ll have more success in the course. And it would be a good way to fill your 3 credits if you can\u2019t find anything else applicable to fill the time.  It\u2019s probably best to consider how you treat coursework before making your final decision. If you do all your work on time consistently, you\u2019ll have more luck in Japanese than if you ignore all your assignments because they\u2019re for class.",

Japanese 1 was, in my opinion, relatively easy. Japanese 2  threw me for a loop. The workload was increased by about 2-3x, and the content does get more difficult. But you get out of it what you put in. I had to study a lot, and a lot of it is just memorization, and if you just study with the textbook and workbook assignments and understand that, you will be okay. \nLike I said, the workload can be kind of overwhelming. You can't procrastinate studying or homework. But if you really want to learn I say go for it!! Like someone else said, you can always drop it in the beginning if it's not your speed. \nGood luck!",

The classes will still challenge you of course, but it's perfectly manageable and I don't know anyone who tried and got lower than a B in any of my classes.\n\nI came in with some Japanese knowledge from high school classes, so this might not be your experience, but I never had an issue keeping my grades at an A. I would say go for it!",

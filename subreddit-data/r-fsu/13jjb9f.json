    "postText": "I will be starting the Learning and Cognition MS program this fall but as an online student. I live in Central Florida, but I would like to occasionally make it to campus. I like college campus' in general, and would love to find a way to develop a connection to the larger school despite not being there on a regular basis.\n\nHas anyone managed this successfully? Any on campus students have recommendations of \"must-dos\" on or around campus?",

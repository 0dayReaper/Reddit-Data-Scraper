    "postText": "Hey I\u2019m going to be an out-of-state freshman starting this fall, and seeing as I\u2019m not bringing a car down and it\u2019s most cost-effective, I\u2019ll be relying on a (not electrical) bike to get around a lot. I planned to purchase this bike and a U-lock once I move. However, today my dad found reCycle, which actually seems better considering my needs. Apparently it\u2019s just $65 a semester and includes the used bike, a lock, helmet, and basic repairs. I\u2019m not going to be bringing a bike I buy home during breaks, either. Are the bikes in good condition, good for covering longer distances if I want to go for a ride in the area, etc? Or would I be better off investing in a brand-new bike?",

Honestly, better peace of mind using it compared to getting a brand new one stolen/damaged from one of the locals/students here in Tallahassee. U-Locks won't save you, the fraternity guys get drunk and hop on bikes trying to take em, if locked they just curb stomp the tires.",

    "postText": "Hi guys. Currently im a freshman thats interested in nursing. As im gonna transfer, I'm wondering where I should transfer to get my nursing degree. The issue is that I don't know what it's like to live in gainesville vs. tally and im not sure if the fsu nursing program is good. However, i'd have to wait two years while living with my parents in order to go to uf. Should I go to fsu for nursing? Please lmk :)",

UF nurses are truly the best trained nurses in the southeast and get much better job opportunities coming out of school.\n\nUltimately you\u2019ll be fine from either school though, nurses don\u2019t have problems getting jobs from any reputable university. Choose FSU for enjoying college and UF for extra training and career opportunities would be my advice.",

Here are my thoughts for both: \n\nFSU seems to really be the better of the two schools for humanities. FSU excels in law, opera, and political science - just to name a few places. There is a strong music program. However, I will say that science is less strong at FSU than at UF. Both have good programs, but FSU has less of a focus on science. I don't know anything about nursing, but I bet that it would follow suit. Both campuses are beautiful - lots of creeping Spanish moss, native flowers planted, and brick pathways. Very collegiate feeling. UF has very strong science programs.\n\nTown wise - if you're younger and looking to get out on the town, FSU is your choice for sure. Gainesville is cute, but it is certainly smaller with fewer bars. (A bit nicer, in my opinion too. Less intense partying.) I would not describe Tallahassee as cute, but it has its charm. Very nice and well-loved arts district in Tally called 'Railroad Square.'",

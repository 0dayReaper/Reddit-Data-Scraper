I\u2019m in the honors program so I\u2019m supposed to have priority registration but not sure how that works. Thanks!",

They will put you in groups based on college and you\u2019ll sit with an advisor for about 15-30 minutes talking about your 4-year plan. Unfortunately all the classes are taken up by current students, so you\u2019ll be left with the freshman courses no matter what. You won\u2019t take full advantage of early registration until you register for spring classes.",

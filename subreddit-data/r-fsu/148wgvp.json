Make sure to take plenty of notes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, if she says that you will fail her first test in the class, you will absolutely. I did not believe her thinking I was going to pass. But I failed with a D. That served as my first humbling lesson in college.",

Also the first exam is not as bad as people make it out to be. I scored a B even though I studied not a lot but I was just paying attention in class. Copy her words almost verbatim for your notes she doesn\u2019t say anything unnecessary and what will be on the exam. Lastly, she will boost your grade is you are engaged and answer her questions especially during the discussion days. I got boosted from a B to an A+. Amazing teacher",

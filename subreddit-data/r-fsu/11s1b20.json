    "postText": "I'm a senior in high school about to enter my freshman year at FSU as a psychology major and all of the housing seems so nice! I wanted to ask for the advice of some older college kids on what would be better for an incoming freshie who knows nothing about college at all. For background knowledge, I do have problems with loud/complex noises and I do prefer bathrooms to be as clean as possible.",

            "comment": "Having been in both if you have the opportunity to live in apartment style go for it. Having your own room and space goes a long way for well being imo. Also having a full size fridge and kitchen rather than having to use the communal ones is awesome. Buildings like Reagan\u2019s also give you the chance to have 2 or 3 roommates so you still get to be social. There is a price difference to consider between the two though.",

            "comment": "Both are nice experiences.  If you want to meet people in your hall, go to the activities that the RAs offer.  You could also get involved with the residence hall government which also plans and organizes activities and you get to meet other people from your residence hall.  Apartment style will be a plus if you plan to cook rather than have a mealplan as you have a full size refrigerator and you have a range, oven, and several cabinets and some counter space compared to suite style where you will have shared kitchens on your floor or wing, and would have to store your groceries in your room.  Suite style rooms do have refrigerators, though they are microfridges so you would have to shop more often due to space constraints if you plan to cook.  If you plan to have a meal plan, the Suwannee Room is the main all you can eat dining hall, while the Seminole Cafe is a supplemental one that is not open as late and is not open for dinner on weekends.  So your residence hall location would be something to consider when deciding if you want a large meal plan, a small meal plan along with some cooking, or no meal plan along with lots of cooking.",

            "comment": "Apartment style is my personal favorite. I\u2019ve lived in Cawthon, then Landis, then Onyx (off campus), then McCollum, and I\u2019ve stayed in McCollum for 3 years now. If you have classes on campus, the dorms are great bc you don\u2019t have to worry about parking. If you want more privacy, Traditions is nice (have a friend that lives there), but I prefer the shared space in McCollum so I don\u2019t feel lonely all the time. Absolutely do not live in Rogers. It floods all the time, you have no windows (it\u2019s just glass and brick in front of it), no privacy, and no desk. \n\nTLDR: Apartment style dorms for on campus classes, anything but Rogers.",

            "comment": "All of the apartment style dorms outside of Ragans are limited to returning students only so unless you have a really good contract number and are able to get into Ragans, you'll end up in a suite style. All of the suite style dorms are generally the same set up, 2-3 people per room with a shared bathroom with the room next door. Salley is the only suite with a different set up, as it has a \"common room\" where the desks are rather than having it with your beds. Essentially bathroom cleaning is left up to you, your roommates, and your suitemates, however the facilities crew does clean the bathrooms once a semester. Noise wise I would try to avoid Degraff as its along the main road and near one of the clubs so it tends to be loud. Wildwood sometimes has noise as well but its usually during the day as its across from where the band practices and near the stadium. As for Ragans, there are four buildings with only one available to freshmen. The rooms have four bedrooms and two baths so you only have to share with one person as opposed to 3-5, and it also has a kitchen whereas the suite style have kitchens shared between the floor or sometimes multiple.",

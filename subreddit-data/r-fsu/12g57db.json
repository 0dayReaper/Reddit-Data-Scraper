            "comment": "I\u2019d advise against student housing. They really try to force you into an overpriced lease as soon as possible. If you have a parent that is able to co-sign/ be a guarantor for you I would get on the waitlist for some of the non-student apartments around town. I\u2019ve heard good things about the arbor properties, and London Town. Another option would be to find a house or townhome on Zillow. Non-student housing listings go up 30-60 days before move in. I\u2019d recommend being a little flexible and looking for a July- august move in date. It can be a little stressful, but there\u2019s always places available in the summertime if you\u2019re flexible with your move in date, and there\u2019s a good chance you can find something much better and less expensive than most student housing options.",

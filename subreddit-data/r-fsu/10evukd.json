I would say that's one of the best neighborhoods for college students as there was always a party happening on any given weekend and you could walk to The Palace.\n\nRent prices could be better but they are very responsive if there is ever anything that needs to be fixed like a broken window or appliances.\n\nYou can probably find cheaper and bigger on craigslist. That's what me an my roommates did for our senior year but the responsiveness to concerns won't be the same",

            "comment": "I got my degree in Mechanical Engineering from FSU but I acknowledge that UF has the more renowned  Engineering program. I would have preferred if the College of Engineering was on the FSU campus rather than being a separate campus. At the end of the day, I still got an excellent education and started making 6 figure just a few years out of college despite my mediocre GPA and no internships. There are also good opportunities for research and a good Masters of Engineering program at FSU. At the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t matter THAT much which university you choose.\n\nI recommend that you visit the college of engineering at each campus and make your decision after that. You won\u2019t much time on the actual FSU campus so don\u2019t be blinded by how nice it is.",

Since that first interview literally no one has cared what university I went to.\n\nOutside of academic prestige, remember that you're going to have to live there for 4-5 years. Pick the one you think you'll enjoy.\n\nPersonally, I liked the separate campus since I never had to deal with parking issues, and had tons of resources entirely dedicated to Engineering majors, like separate computer labs and study areas.",

I know Cummins hires a lot of people through FSU due to its partnerships with SAE. \n\nAs a side note, FSU (and probably most schools) don\u2019t offer a dedicated automotive engineering program. You instead complete a mechE degree and your senior tech electives will be automotive oriented; i.e. you will result in a degree specialization. But it\u2019s practically the same thing.",

FSU does not have an engineering dept per se, they rely on a joint program with FAMU, so the quality is not as good. UF challenges you more academically and mentally, so you will get used to pressure, which is something that you'll need once you get a job.",

My experience was that the FAMU professors that taught at the college of engineering were excellent. Many of them genuinely cared about teaching and not just about their research. Also, the classes taught at each university are going to be very similar. Dynamics isn\u2019t magically more complex because it\u2019s taught at one university over another.

It took only 1 year for them to expand the \"don't say gay\" bill to k-12. Its always a slow creep. Exceptions today are gone tomorrow.",

That\u2019s why it was so easy to change how the law was enforced to include a total ban for grades 4-12. \n\nWhile the state may impose more strict measures with House Bill 999 they are not likely going to impose these measures on the exceptions laid out in HB 999. You are forgetting that many of these state Republicans are actively involved with many different DEI programs that help low income, first generation, and Pell grant eligible students, such as Take Stock in Children. And as we both know, these state Republicans don\u2019t like making laws that impact themselves in a negative way.",

Is hazing really as bad as it seems? \n\nI want to party in college no matter where I go but I\u2019ve heard FSU is the bomb. I don\u2019t want to miss out on all the fun because I\u2019m not in a frat.",

            "comment": "Two things. One, partying isn\u2019t exclusive to fraternities. You can party without being in a frat. Two. Should you rush? Depends. You will have to be willing to give up much of your semester to rush, and be willing to listen to what the fraternities say and dictate. Hazing isn\u2019t too bad from what I\u2019ve heard, for specific fraternities it is pretty bad, but I also am not in a frat. If you want to rush and want the fraternity lifestyle, go for it. If you just want to party, imo it ain\u2019t worth it",

You\u2019ll find your people elsewhere.\n\nHowever if it appeals to you, I think you should at least go through the rush process and see what it\u2019s like firsthand. If it\u2019s not for you, you can always drop, but at least you will know. And if it is your thing, then that\u2019s great and you didn\u2019t miss out on the opportunity.",

Don\u2019t rush some frat for status because the status doesn\u2019t really matter. \n\nI was in a top tier frat and loved my time. I lived in house. We partied way too hard. Life was good. \n\nHazing nowadays isn\u2019t bad. No one is gonna make you chug liquor. No one is gonna beat you up. They\u2019ll mentally mess with you and screw with you. If you start the pledge process and the hazing is too much, just drop the frat. It\u2019s not a big deal\n\nTLDR: if you\u2019re gonna rush, don\u2019t force it. Find a frat that you like and could see yourself thriving in. Don\u2019t worry about hazing. Enjoy your time at fsu. Fraternities are definitely a lot of fun if you do it right",

There is also a large time demand, and pledging is very demanding on your time and energy. \n\nPersonally, I always figured it made more sense to take all of the money I would've spent on a frat and instead spend it on building a social life. \n\nFor example, Ubers, beers, cover charge for parties, going out for food with friends, participating in other events.\n\nBasically, for less money you can invest in your own social life and get the friends and activities you want without all of the hassle of, and getting tied down by, a frat.",

It\u2019s a great time, it provides a sense of community, you make life long friends, it\u2019s fun to be a part of something bigger than yourself that you can take pride in, and it provides you with events, functions, and experiences you might not have the chance to be a part of otherwise. You can most certainly have a great time partying at fsu without it, so weigh the options. It is a lot more stripped down in terms of social events now from when I was there. I think there were 22-24 when I first got to college and about half have gotten kicked off now. I I have a little brother there now and he went through pledging recently and it\u2019s much more toned down then it used to be. There\u2019s always going to be the people who never rushed, or rushed and didn\u2019t get a bid, that will give you the whole \u201c i didn\u2019t need to pay for my friends to have fun\u201d line. Weigh it out, Definetly do house preview, Definetly rush, and if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s for you, then you don\u2019t need to join. Live it up at fsu, it\u2019ll be awesome.

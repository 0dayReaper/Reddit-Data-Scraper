    "postText": "Hello, I'm a high school senior, looking into FSU and UCF mechanical engineering program. My priorities are getting a good education with good teachers and a lot of resources, lots of job opportunities/internships, having a fun time in college, as well as graduating on time. It would cost the same for me to go to either one of them, so no worries on pricing. I know there is going to be a lot of bias, but please give your honest take.",

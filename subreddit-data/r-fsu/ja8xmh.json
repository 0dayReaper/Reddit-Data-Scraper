Sadly this proves that while those people do exist at the school, they are a vast minority. Most FSU students are wealthy kids from the South/New Jersey/New York who only did well on their standardized test scores because their schools offered them free SAT/ACT prep courses. I know all college kids party, but FSU's culture takes it to an extreme. Most people here finish their degree with only 4 years worth of memories of blacking out and making out with strangers. I definitely do not plan on staying in Tallahassee for graduate school.",

    "postText": "Quick question, if I am taking multiple courses that require a tophat subscription, do I have to pay per course? When I click on a course it asks me to pay \\~30, but only lists that one course in the checkout. I asked my professor and they had said it should only be one payment for as many courses as I want. Has anyone else taken multiple TopHat courses at a time and knows where to go to get the correct payment? I would rather pay 30 than 60 lol. \n\nIve looked around and there seems to be no option to 'buy' tophat pro, unless I go through one of my courses and click 'purchase' on that specific course. This leads me to believe ill have to pay for both..",

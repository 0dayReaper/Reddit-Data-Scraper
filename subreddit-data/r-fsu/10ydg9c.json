    "postText": "Hi I'm a high school senior that applied to FSU and got in with early action. I received an email today from admissions telling me to pay the $200 deposit, and I mistakenly thought that this was the housing deposit. After paying I found out later that this was to secure my spot in the freshman class and I freaked out because I thought this meant I am legally binded to go to FSU. After doing some research apparently it is not legally binding??? But either way I'm worried now and am extremely mad at myself for making such a stupid mistake. Would it be possible for me to get a refund? (I know it's nonrefundable)",

On one hand I\u2019m grateful for taking advantage of the virtual semester because it\u2019s letting me work nearly full time from home at the same time. On the other hand I feel like when 8 pm rolls around and I finally get up from my desk I have the personality of a brick. I\u2019m not engaged in my classes at all and I feel no desire to even try. On weekends I have no desire to catch up with friends bc it\u2019s the only time I have to think. What\u2019s making this all worse is the looming possibility of having to repeat this again next semester. If the rest of my college career is this I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll finish.\n\nEdit: for everyone feeling lost, behind, and nervous/anxious about assignments and schoolwork, I highly recommend the website Notion. I created a master schedule with all assignments/grades/tests for all of my classes and it\u2019s all labeled by date, class, &amp; assignment type and it\u2019s really helpful. It makes me feel a little less overwhelmed because I can visualize everything I have to do and I know what\u2019s coming up. It\u2019s really customizable and you can do it with notes for classes and other groups, etc.",

Just want you to know you're not alone with that struggle. \n\nWhen I heard the testing center was opening back up at the end of summer, I crammed for 4 CLEPs so I could graduate in December and wouldn't have to do this another semester. I couldn't stand the thought.",

Since I'm a college of music student I've spent years and years practicing to be able to go to a competitive music school, and now that I'm in one I feel totally underwhelmed at how things are going. I know covid is totally to blame, but I hate that I spent the whole year leading up to my audition season stressing the fuck out and practicing my ass off at the expense of my social life to earn a place at a really good school of music just to spend my first semester of college listening to zoom lectures about a random ass musical genre completed unrelated to anything I care about... Also managing due dates on 4 different websites has been a proper pain in the ass and I never feel like I'm in 100% of my school work lmao. Hope everyone else feeling burnt out, or how I'm feeling still takes time to enjoy themselves and have fun from time to time. Stay healthy my friends ^-^",

    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI am thinking about becoming an MIS major but also thinking about combining something else with it because I am also interested in the technical side of MIS. Would it be a good idea to pair this with a major in computer science or IT? Or would it be better to just minor in one of these? Or does the degree have enough of this side already that it doesn't matter? \n\nThanks for any help.",

It depends on what you\u2019re trying to do, if you\u2019re trying to go into IT minor in that, data/analytics do Business Analytics. There\u2019s only one \u201cprogramming\u201d class requirement in MIS, so you can also go into CS if you want to learn more about that. BA is more R/Python/Data Visualizations. As a fresh grad of the MIS program, it\u2019s really just interest based, there\u2019s so many options. Good luck!",

Do what makes sense for you - if you\u2019re looking to get into the programming side of things, a minor in CS will go a long way. If you want get into database relations or system support - do IT. Feel free to direct message me if you need some guidance in the field. Happy to help.",

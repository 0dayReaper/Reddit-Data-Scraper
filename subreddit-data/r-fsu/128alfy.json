    "postText": "Hello, I'm an admitted international student from Sri Lanka. I was looking to register for orientation but the latest date available is shown as July 28th. This is about a month before classes start and 3 weeks before campus housing opens which is an issue for me because I will need to find accommodation during that time.\nAre there later orientation dates than july 28th or is it the only option?\n\nThank you for reading.",

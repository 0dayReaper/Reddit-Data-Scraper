It was definitely one of the hardest Econ classes I took at FSU just because there is so much to learn, but it was also probably one of the most worthwhile classes I took. Im not sure I would want to do it in 6 weeks but I would definitely recommend taking it.",

However, if youre taking it in 6 weeks itd only even be worth taking if its your only class, or maybe if you had one other easy 12 week class. The problem is getting anything worthwhile out of the class requires significantly more work than passing the class does, so if youre just taking it for the credit then you can do it no question, but if wanted to get anything more out of the class then that would be a class id be more willing to take over 12/16 weeks",

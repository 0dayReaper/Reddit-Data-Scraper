    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI recently received an admit to the MSCS program at FSU  for the Fall 2023 semester. I am thrilled to have been accepted, and I am now looking to connect with current and former students of the program to gain more insights and information.\n\nI would love to hear about your experiences with the program, the coursework, the faculty, the research opportunities, and any advice or suggestions you might have for a prospective student. I am also interested in learning more about the student community, campus life, and the overall culture at FSU .\n\nIf you are a current or former MSCS student at FSU State, please feel free to share your thoughts and experiences with me. I am eager to connect with you and learn more about this program.\n\nThank you in advance for your time and help!",

There are some incredible faculty, some below average ones (I\u2019m sure this goes for any college), and I got into research super easily just by asking a professor who\u2019s research I aligned with. Sorry I don\u2019t have any CS specific information but just wanted to congratulate you!",

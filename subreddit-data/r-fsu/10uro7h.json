That is the number of hours you can hit without paying extra.\nThe number of hours needed to graduate is just the minimum number of credit hours you need to take and pass to be eligible for a degree from FSU.",

The 120 hours you need minimum to graduate is based on cumulative earned hours plus whatever you were enrolled in right now, not counting any class you might be repeating and duplicating right now",

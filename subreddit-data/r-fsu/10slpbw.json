    "postText": "Last year due to health issues as well as housing issues, I had to drop my classes and come back home. \n\nNow I felt the process of going to the doctors and dealing with bettering myself didnt allow me to really think about going back for this semester so I didnt enroll this semester either. Now I am logging back onto my fsu portal and seeing that it appears that somehow my enrollment as student has been taken away.\n\nI called admissions office and they tried to get me in contact with the readmissions department but they werent available. \n\naside from that i am also a BFA major so I couldnt even consider online courses at home cause the major is mostly face to face. \n\nWas i kicked off the BFA program due to this too? I am honestly now kind of worried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nappreciate any advice, thanks",

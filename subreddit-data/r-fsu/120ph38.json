Their family will just end up sitting next to your family if they follow assigned seating so they may need to trade seats with strangers if it\u2019s totally full. \n\nIt\u2019s only selling them that\u2019s not allowed, as the university considers it wrong to profit off what they\u2019re giving you for free.",

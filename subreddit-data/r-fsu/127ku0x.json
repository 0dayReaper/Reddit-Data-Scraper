    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nDon\u2019t know if anyone has any answers to this or have had similar experiences, but I signed a lease for this upcoming fall at a pretty popular apartment complex but need to break the lease as I no longer plan to live there. \n\nI have heard at seemingly a lot of apartments it is seemingly pretty easy to break a lease if you have not yet moved in, but for this complex in particular they are only giving me the option of giving my lease to someone, of which I\u2019m having major problems with as they still have some spots available for the unit I want (even though my lease would technically be cheaper).\n\nIs this truly the only way to go about breaking a lease? It seems a little odd, but I don\u2019t have much experience within this sector. \n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "dealt with something like this at my previous apartment complex. they told me and it was in my lease that the only way out was 1) paying all upcoming rent payments (my lease was 1.5 years which would have been tens of thousands of dollars) or find a sublease. college housing intentionally does this especially here because most of the college kids are wealthy and have parents who pay for everything so its an easy way to ensure they get their money. not to mention young adults dont have the experience to see stuff like that as a red flag (i know i didnt). \n\nits so scummy. hate people who take advantage of those who simply just dont know better. but unfortunately your only way out is probably a sublease. luckily you have plenty of time and lots of people look for subleases all the time in this area so if its a nice complex close to campus you shouldn\u2019t have any issues. try posting to the sublease page within this subreddit and putting up an add on fb marketplace :)",

Who is the Florida court system? If we are talking about the Florida Supreme Court I would love to get a citation so i can read the case.\n\nIf we are talking about appellate courts it may not be binding statewide. If we are talking about trial courts, then in *that* case the court decided an accelerated rent clause may have been determined to be \"illegal\" per the terms of the lease.\n\nIf what you are saying is BROADLY true, that accelerate rent clauses in Florida are illegal, then that's huge and I have heard nothing of it. \n\nPLEASE provide more information if you can.",

Some apartments allow for early cancellation with a few months rent as a fee. Others do not. If they still have available rooms I do not see them letting you out of your lease without a substantial fee. Why are you no longer living there?",

It appears that if you do not assign or sublet the premises, you\u2019ll be responsible for landlords loss of rent until it\u2019s rented again.

    "postText": "\n\nHi. I'm a senior at UF majoring in Criminology and Law. I'm thinking about possibly taking a different route since pre-law didn't work out for me. I love writing poems and filming has been working a lot for me. I started doing it for fun during covid but then I ended up really enjoying it. I feel like it's more than just a hobby and it truly is my passion. Therefore, I'm thinking about going to grad school for film and media. Any thoughts about UF's Film and Media Studies (Ph.D, 6 years) vs. FSU's College of Motion Picture Arts? I'm not sure what I'm gonna do with the degree, maybe I'd like to be a professor in Film? Or work in the film industry? Or even start my own business as a wedding filmmaker, advertiser, commercial maker, and so on. \n\nAlso another topic, \nI really wanna further my education but I suck so bad at stats and writing (essays, research, etc). I feel like the writing part has something to do with the fact that English isn't my first language. I didn't grow up in the US either. I migrated when I was 14 and went straight to 9th grade (my first school year ever in the US). In high school I've always been behind in English.  I went to Santa Fe for 2 years and somehow got admitted to UF. (I also went to FSU for a semester). \n\nIM ALSO AN OVERTHINKER. I feel like because I suck at my research class, I can never get better at it. Therefore, I don't belong to graduate school. I DONT UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S SOMETHING TO DEVELOP and I have to suck at it first.",

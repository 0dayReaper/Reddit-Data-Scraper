    "postText": "I\u2019m about to transfer to FSU and I have 3 electives left to take. I\u2019m debating between going for Management information Systems or Computer science (BA). They both have similarities although the CS BA, is not usually abet accredited and I don\u2019t know if people look down on that. I\u2019m interested in both subjects and at the end of they day tech is very expansive I could do the same thing with both degrees if I wanted to, but I would like to know which one is best over all.",

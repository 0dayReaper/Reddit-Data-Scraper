Business is looked upon favorably by private sector employers. And of course a foreign language will be very helpful in foreign policy work.",

It would be useful to understand the why behind policy decisions and have quantitative analysis skills.\n\nThere\u2019s also a certificate in intelligence studies offered by the department of emergency management which is top-tier and taught by military intelligence officers. All the classes count towards his public administration concentration within the political science major.",

Ive heard a fair amount about that intelligence track that other commenters have mentioned, and would also probably recommend that if it can be done within the scope of his PolySci degree.\n\nIf he does end up doing Economics the essential courses would be game theory, state and local government assuming Professor Norton is still offering it by the time he gets around to it, and intermediate macroeconomics, although if he can also take international finance that would also be a really solid course for a PolySci major.\n\nAlternatively he could do an international affairs minor, which is 18 credits (so longer than most other minors) but gives him the opportunity to take some of basically all classes in the college of social sciences (the 18 credits must be from at least 3 different departments).",

It quickly became my minor, and I\u2019ve now taken so much of it that I will be graduating with a dual degree (one in Poli Sci, the other in Economics). I highly recommend your son try Econ and consider making that his minor.\n\nOtherwise, the history department at FSU is top notch, and I ended up minoring in that. Other recommendations, such as International Relations or Statistics, are also great. But it\u2019s all up to your son\u2019s interests and what he finds the most compelling.",

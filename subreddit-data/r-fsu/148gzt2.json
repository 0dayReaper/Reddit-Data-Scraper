    "postText": "Pretty much what the title says. I looked through quite a bit of somewhat related posts and couldn't really find a time frame or anything. Anyone know how long it usually takes for the Dean's (arts and science) decision to allow you to withdraw or not? I find it a little annoying having to continue working on assignments/exams without some sort of an expected response time. It isn't an emergency or mental health withdrawal either if that matters. The classes I am taking simply have 0 value for me since recently, I heard that I was granted admission to a different school/program for the fall. I took summer classes at FSU just in case I was not accepted to the other program. I did not want to potentially fall behind.",

            "comment": "It depends on the type of withdrawal and the time of the semester. Medical and mental health stuff has to go through a committee from University health services that gives the deans offices a recommendation. That usually takes at least two weeks from the time you submit everything to UHS. If it was a withdrawal for personal hardship, it also depends on when you submit the documentation to the deans office because then whichever group in the college reviews it has to make their recommendation to the deans office. It also depends on the time of the year because if it's a really busy time, people have less ability to review, and there may be a lot more applications coming in.",

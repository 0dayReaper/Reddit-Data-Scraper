I tell every undergrad about it because I don\u2019t think IDS classes are necessary to graduate anymore- it was just so cool!",

I took it a couple years ago, the very first time they had it. It was a little boring and not structured great I thought, but also this was the first semester so it was experimental. The professor was nice enough and the workload wasn't bad, so I'd say take it. I'd expect another writing credit class to be much more work.",

Got to do some things \"the old way\" like different integration methods, but also some cool stuff you wouldn't learn otherwise in the math degree like continued fractions. You write about those sorts of things for the most part, so that's the writing component, but there is a good deal of math.",

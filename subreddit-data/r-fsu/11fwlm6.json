            "comment": "Definitely cannot adjust the set point, the only option is to make it think your room is hotter than it is by placing something warm under/near the thermostat.  The effect this will have depends on what dorm you\u2019re in.  Salley, for example, shares 1 AC unit between two separate dorm rooms, and averages the temperature of the two respective thermostats.",

And it\u2019s too warm outside now that I can\u2019t just keep my window open to cool down. I don\u2019t have anything i can strap to the thermostat to make it warmer, not sure what to do..",

            "comment": "Probably the system is set to heat mode rather than AC mode which can be a problem during the winter when it gets warm for a few days.  The newer halls like Traditions should have a 4 pipe system so it should be possible for the system to send in AC or outside air rather than heated air when its warmer weather, though the campus chilled water system might be offline for repairs due to it being winter so its possible all it can offer is blowing around outside air.  You can talk to your hall maintenance manager about the temperature in the rooms being rather warm as they might be able to adjust the building systems, particularly in the older halls like Salley, Rogers, or McCollum.",

    "postText": "Could be a dumb question. Just wanted to ask. Does anyone in beginner classes for any language offered on campus have an actual prof teaching or are all beginner language classes taught by grad students? Follow up question: do all beginner language classes follow the format of teach yourself everything and show up to class just to be tested? I'm getting barely any classroom instruction and would just like to know if other foreign language learners are having similar issues.",

    "postText": "Hello, so I\u2019m a double major student currently. I\u2019m majoring in International Affairs (primary) and Accounting.\n\nI\u2019m receiving financial aid that\u2019s critical for me to go to afford university.\n\nI heard from multiple of my friends that some colleges require you to switch majors if you\u2019re off track for a certain amount of semesters.\n\nIn order for me to keep receiving financial aid I cannot finish my first degree early.\n\nSo I have to finish my requirements for my primary degree during the same semester as my second degree in order for me to keep receiving financial aid till my last semester.\n\nHowever, since I\u2019m taking an extra year to graduate (5th year) this will put me off track my primary major.\n\nIs there a penalty in the COSSPP? Would they force me to change my major even though I\u2019m close to completing it?\n\nOne of my friends told me that she was a marine biology major, and she got off track so they forced her to change majors.\n\nWill that happen to me? Or will they do something drastic like remove me from my second major?\n\nAny information would be helpful, thanks!",

Finished my Econ requirements before my Finance requirements. I was required to submit a form with my academic advisor with detailed the remaining classes I had to take, and I was not permitted to register for anything other than those classes. For me it was literally one class, so not much of an issue. I also had to submit a form to remove the excess credit surcharge from my tuition.\n\nI would communicate with your advisor. If your advisor signed off on your academic plan to be a dual degree then you should be able to communicate with them regarding the financial aid issues you would experience by graduating early.",

That said, some programs have more lenient milestones than others. The complicateed part of double majoring is that you have to stay on track for the primary major but the second major can be finished in whatever order is possible.  \n\n\ntl;dr: talk with an advisor for your primary major first. That's what matters in terms of staying on track. Finish the other major around it as possible.",

Daughter came is with more than 90 credits so she actually required an exceptions to do dual degrees. The exception includes a rather inflexible schedule that has the IA done a long time before the Engineering. More Credits transferred in applicable to the IA is how this happened.",

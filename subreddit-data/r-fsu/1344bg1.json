    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming undergrad major in economics, I will likely have 30-40 credits from AP already and skip most of gen ed/intro classes. I think I want to concentrate in the more mathematical/quantitative side of econ, does FSU have a specific program/path for this or would I just take more math classes as I wanted? Then I\u2019m wondering if I should actually double major in finance and if that\u2019s possible in 4 years, especially if I\u2019ll have more job/internship opportunities.",

If you\u2019re more interested in the Finance side, the Applied Economics one seems to fit that. \n\nApparently you can do one of these two programs instead of the 15 hours of Economics electives required for the major. \n\nResources:\n\n-\t[Economics Major Requirements](https://coss.fsu.edu/economics/undergraduate-program/major-requirements/)\n-\t[Specialized Studies Programs in Economics](https://coss.fsu.edu/economics/undergraduate-program/specialized-studies/)",

I was happy with my education but I definitely wish I had taken more math since the program by itself without any of the specializations isn't all that math heavy. If you want to do graduate education in economics it may be worth it to double major in Math, or at least minor in math.\n\nIf you want to go into the private sector after you graduate (as I did) then a double major in finance may be a better option for you. I would still get a math minor nonetheless.",

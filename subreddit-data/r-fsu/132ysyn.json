Currently a sophomore and my current FSU GPA is a 3.8, may be low, but I was pretty depressed my freshman year here (hence why I\u2019m transferring to UF) and couldn\u2019t get myself to care. Anyways, I\u2019m transferring into CLAS for economics. Not many extra curriculars with FSU besides UROP/research and a couple of clubs. I have a few, more significant, ECs outside of FSU. I don\u2019t think ECs matter that much (or at all?) just as long as you have your prerequisites. Essays weren\u2019t hard either, I only worked on them for a couple of hours. I think it took them 3 weeks to accept me even though they prioritize community college transfers\u2026 I think you\u2019ll be fine as long as you aren\u2019t failing your classes.",

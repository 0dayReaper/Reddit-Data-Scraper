    "postText": "I\u2019m currently going into my junior year at fsu and I have switched my major twice now. I was a business major, currently a retail entrepreneurship major, but I feel unsatisfied with that now. I am very creative, I love art, film, psychology and mythology and am passionate about the environment. I was considering switching to environmental science but I don\u2019t think i could pass all of those hard classes. I have been considering an ISS degree with a focus in Urban Regional Planning and Sociology, but I have concerns about job opportunities and salary if i choose that route. i\u2019m running out of time and i really need help. I\u2019ve considered DMP but that means i\u2019d have to push back my graduation a year, and there\u2019s a chance i won\u2019t be accepted into the program anyways. Any advise on what degree to pursue?",

            "comment": "honestly at this point i would stick with whatever major you can graduate on time in, and focus on internships and experience. your major isn\u2019t everything and plenty of people are successful even when their major isn\u2019t 100% relevant to what they\u2019re passionate about\n\nalso, there\u2019s nothing wrong with taking more than 4 years, but you\u2019ll run out of bright futures and federal funding after year 5",

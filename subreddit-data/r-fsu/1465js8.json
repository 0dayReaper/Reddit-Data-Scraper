    "postText": "As a real estate major, most of my favorite classes/professors are in college of business but not all. To name a few, \n\n\u2022Will Whitehead - MUN2210 - University Sinfonia (chose this class bc I enjoy playing violin. Very easy and laid back. Great instructor as well)\n\n\u2022Michael Brady - MAR3023 - Basic Marketing Concepts (Cares about what he teaches and makes class interactive. Online but not a hard class)\n\n\u2022Jenny Weigel - CLT3378 - Ancient Mythology (You can tell history is her true passion, she loves intricate cool details in mythology. Intermediate difficulty but tests are open note)\n\n\u2022William Woodyard - REE3043 - Real Estate Principles Practices (Invaluable info in this class if you're pursuing a career in real estate. Prof Woodyard knows all the ins and outs of the industry. Easy class, only grades are 4 tests.)\n\n\u2022Paul Schriefer - RMI3011 - Risk Management/Insurance (Hard class but I didn't really study at all which is why I got a D. Super interesting and useful though.)\n\n\u2022Volleyball - PEL1321 - (loved this class made alot of friends and got to play some relaxed volleyball)",

He also just seemed like a cool dude",

I love the midterm, final and substantial paper format. I took another special topics class with him as well. Spent a lot of time in office hours, I was (and still am) fairly passionate about Economics",

Also consider the following factors - faculty - teaching facilities, housing facility/amenities, cost of living in general as Food is not included in the program fee, book fees, safety, and other general considerations , etc?\n\nThank you so much.",

You\u2019ll be doing mostly gen eds but if there are major specific courses you need to take freshman year to stay on schedule for your major you should find out which study centers offer them. Keep in mind that they\u2019re called study centers and not campuses for a reason. Class offerings may be more limited than they are on main campus",

Also these are part of FSU, so there is no affiliation to any foreign universities. every professor you have is faculty and staff of FSU",

Cost is about $48K plus food and other miscellaneous living expenses. \n\nFor Actuarial Science, options are Panama and London. Not so easy to align courses precisely. Additionally, u finish roughly 3 semesters abroad and then start again in Fall at the main campus. This may also cause some issues with course alignment as the fall semester is supposed to be typical 3rd semester, which FYA program completes overseas during the summer. \n\nLondon, Valencia, Florence are stand alone FSU study centers, whereas Panama center has its own university students both domestic and international.",

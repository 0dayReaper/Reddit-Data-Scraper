    "postText": "Hello Everyone.\n\nI was looking through some threads on here and I\u2019m getting contradictory answers to this question .\n\nSome people are saying that both degrees will show up on my diploma while others are saying only my primary one will show up on my diploma.\n\nSo which is the actual answer?\n\nAlso, if only one is going to show up on my diploma, is there a way I could get it to show my secondary major instead? I would prefer that.\n\nIf not, is there a way I can switch which one is my primary major? I\u2019m currently a junior.\n\nI\u2019m also wondering\u2026 if I double major will I be able to apply for grad school for either major? Or will I only qualify for grad school for whatever is my primary major?\n\nThanks!",

You can email them at graduation@fsu.edu\n\nMaybe the reason both show up for some people is because they did a double major within different colleges?? I know that when I initially was a double major, I was told only my primary major would show up which is why I switched to a dual degree. No way I wasn\u2019t going to have my efforts show on my diploma.",

Dual degree is two separate degrees (you get separate diplomas).\n\nIt used to be that if you double majored, both majors were printed on your diploma. I believe I read that this is no longer the case and only your primary major will show up on your diploma. Kinda lame if true.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone. I applied for the BA Studio Art, time-based media as a rejected applicant from the Animation program at Film School. My long-term goal is to become an Animator or Illustrator, but definitely I feel passionate about storytelling, character design, and drawing. But, Im scared I start the degree, and the classes are IA focused and I don't really get to learn anything about animating characters or at least get to learn the basics. I also planned to do a double major in Creative Writing to get something similar to a degree in Film school.\n\nTo any student who is already in that degree path or any graduate alumn, do you guys think your selection is worth it?",

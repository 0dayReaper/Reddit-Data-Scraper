    "postText": "A couple days ago, I made a post here looking for the owner of a lost envelope containing $800. I had a few contenders but none were able to verify the name written on the envelope.\n\nI did as a popular comment suggested and left a note around the same place I found the money and, sure enough, was contacted soon after on Reddit (though I am unsure if he found my original post or the note I left) with the correct color and name on the envelope.\n\nWe agreed to meet in a public area, at which he brought two of his friends. \n\nThe owner did unfortunately accuse me of stealing it, not believing he\u2019d actually left it under a bush, instead implying I snatched it from his person, so our conversation was cut relatively short.\n\nFor those curious, he didn\u2019t give any reward, insinuating I should be lucky law enforcements won\u2019t be involved.\n\nI wish the exchange could have gone better but I\u2019m glad I was able to find the original owner because I would definitely want someone to do the same for me.",

If you\u2019re looking for people to hang/study with, I\u2019d suggest getting in touch with Alpha Chi Sigma. They only have new member events at the beginning of the fall and spring semester, but they\u2019re still probably the biggest concentrated group of chem/biochem majors around the department, so you could still try to study/hang with them.",

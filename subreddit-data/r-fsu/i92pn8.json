    "postText": "So I\u2019ve been moved in for a couple days now, and I\u2019ve seen basically no one wearing masks. Doesn\u2019t seem like anyone is enforcing it. It\u2019s primarily freshmen from what I can tell, but it\u2019s still wild. I saw a group of 7 girls all going maskless and being gathered in close quarters in a study room. As someone who is immunocompromised, and lives and works on campus, I\u2019m just so stressed about all of the cases we will have unless they enforce this policy.",

            "comment": "Wearing masks is hard to enforce because RA\u2019s and receptionists aren\u2019t constantly walking the halls and looking in every common space. However, if you are at all uncomfortable or see actions that are harmful to the community you can definitely reach out to your RA or the person at the front desk so that they can go address the situation. Housing staff is always working to build a better community and right now during covid we need to be holding eachother accountable. We might not like these new rules but by moving in on campus we all agreed to follow them.",

A lot of people in the college age range are not taking this seriously, they don't magically start caring when you give them a position.\n\nAnd even if they do care, since there's no actual ramification either ticket wise or some academic punishment to being caught without a mask, people aren't going to care if you catch them without a mask. They might pretend to care and maybe even put it on, but the second you're out of sight, it's back off.",

FSU housing added to their contract addendum that if they find that an individual is not following the rules and is putting the community at increased risk then their contract can be invalidated and they can be asked to move out.",

The University reserves the right to make other rules and regulations that in its judgment may be necessary for the safety, care and cleanliness of the premises and for the preservation of order. The student agrees to abide by all additional rules and regulations that are adopted.\n\nThe student conduct code (https://sccs.fsu.edu/sites/g/files/upcbnu1476/files/SRR/FSU%20Student%20Conduct%20Code%20Updated%20September%202019.pdf ) states a number of scenarios that would count for violation, for the mask violation pretty it would count under Endangerment (Action(s) that imminently endanger the health, or safety of another person or group) or Other violations (Violation of federal or state law, local ordinance, or laws of other national jurisdictions.) since Leon County has a mask ordinance in place right now. If the violations are reported, the individuals will be investigated and meet with a board of the student conduct. Now they do have a lot of outcomes that could take place but one includes \n\nHousing Probation. This status is assigned to a student for a specified period of time. While on this status, any further violation(s) may result in termination or reassignment of housing. In addition, this status constitutes a disciplinary record that will remain on file with the Student Conduct Authority in a manner consistent with University records retention policies.\n\nand\n\nTermination or reassignment of housing. Removal or reassignment of an individual in University housing after a specific date and for a specified period of time. If removed, the student may be restricted from entering all University residence halls. This status constitutes a disciplinary record that will remain on file with the Student Conduct Authority in a manner consistent with University records retention policies. \n\nThey also have administrative directive outcomes, one of them being: \n\nLoss of privilege. Denial of any specified privilege for a specified period of time. Examples include, but are not limited to: guest privileges, restriction from a University event or program, or restriction from an area or building. \n\nAs for the guide to residence living ( https://housing.fsu.edu/_documents/Guide-to-Residence-Living.pdf ) they have a section dedicated to COVID-19 where they talk about having to wear a mask, social distance and if you do get covid that you have quarantine in Rogers Hall. \n\u00a0",

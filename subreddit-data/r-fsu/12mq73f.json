    "postText": "Happy graduation season, y\u2019all!\n\nWhile you\u2019re taking your grad pics, or any photos around campus, please be mindful of what you leave behind. Today, there was some sorority group at Westcott Fountain taking photos, and they left piles of plastic confetti scattered all over the bricks and grass. It\u2019s so disheartening to see people litter without a second thought. Even without the negative environmental impact, it also just is a bitch to clean up and now is a nuisance for anyone else taking photos in the same spot who wanted to show off how pretty campus is, and now has rainbow plastic litter all over the photo.",

It\u2019s the same thing with beer cans and broken bottles from the 21st birthday fountain-throw tradition. People just leave their cans and bottles scattered around, including floating in the actual fountain.",

Like you said there's the fountain dunk tradition but it seems like people just straight up go there to drink beer and party late at night. There's almost always litter around the fountain of one kind of another. Not to mention the ground becomes sticky from all the beer, champagne, and wine they're spilling everywhere. \n\nSo there are maintenance and grounds workers cleaning up and repairing the fountain and grass every morning throughout the year.\n\nIt's embarrassing that someone can get to a preeminent university but cannot find a sense of responsibility to clean up the messes they make in a public space.",

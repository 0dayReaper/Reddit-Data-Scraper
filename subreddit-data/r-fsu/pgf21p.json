    "postText": "It's hard to believe this site isn't blowing up about how FSU is literally tossing students off campus within hours of a testing positive. My child's dorm mate tested positive before the first week of classes ended and was tossed off campus within hours.  My son's symptons started days later and tried to walk-in for testing at the health center. Nurse told him to make an appointment at the civic center. Next available was 3 days out. 24 hrs after testing, was called stating he needed to leave campus before dark as they were deactivating his FSU ID for 10 days from testing date. It's already been 6 days of illness. He's about over it now and is expected to be out another 10 days.  FSU provides no assistance on where to go off campus, how to get there, grub hub charges to deliver his prepaid meal plan and only one of his teachers offer online instruction. The way FSU is caring for Covid students is ethically wrong and seems nearly criminal. Yet no one is talking about it as if it were ok.",

That process needs to improve. \n\nHowever, some of the comments here reveal a deep lack of understanding of how the university of funded (specifically the impact of state funding vs student payments), and also a lack of understanding of your own housing contract that you signed your name to when you chose a residence hall. There's a whole addendum in bold lettering on your contract that you agreed to regarding pandemic procedures and COVID quarantining, because the University knew its hands would be tied and wanted to make sure the student body understood upfront what the situation was. An email was sent out about it in June when the decision was explicitly made to have positive cases isolate at home, and students were given much more flexibility to cancel contracts this year if they found the terms unacceptable. Again, I'm not coming here with an attitude of schadenfreude or smugness at all - I hate seeing students impacted in this way. But I'm increasingly frustrated with the position the university is in between a state government that is maliciously apathetic and a population on campus who doesn't care or doesn't understand why it is important for everyone to mask and vaccinate. This is why. We're seeing it play out now, in this thread.",

I don't think they should just come out tomorrow with a mask mandate (well, i do, but i understand why they feel like they can't), but I wish they would *fight* for us. There have also been options put forward for more safety practices that don't violate any of the governor's mandates, and they won't put those in place. \n\nMaybe they are fighting for us behind closed doors. I hope they are. But it feels like I'm fighting for the lives of my colleagues and students alone. If they hate it as much as they say they do, *help us*.

This needs to be talked about in the press. This is a scandal. \n\nI don\u2019t care what people say about the Governor threatening the school\u2019s funding or whatever. Unless he has a gun to their heads, there is absolutely no excuse to take THIS as their course of action. FSU can\u2019t even reach out to a local hotel or something to see what can be done? Don\u2019t tell me that they can\u2019t. My girlfriend\u2019s workplace was able to do such a thing during Hurricane Michael. Don\u2019t tell me FSU doesn\u2019t have even more financial clout than some podunk call center.\n\nThose of you downvoting are just apologizing for this shit. Fuck funding. Imagine how few people will be coming to FSU when this eventually reaches the national newsphere. Imagine how THAT will affect the funding. There are so many steps that could be taken to oppose this horseshit, but no one wants to because of some Orwellian sense of duty at the threat of punishment. Fuck that. People are already being punished for doing what they should. The community is being harmed because people shrug their shoulders and say \u201cso it goes.\u201d\n\nYes, the students who aren\u2019t vaccinated and aren\u2019t wearing masks are partly to blame. Yet the people in the administration that just listen to DeSantis without a hint of defiance are also to blame. If K-12 schools with even less funding can defy DeSantis, so can FSU. The difference is that those people just don\u2019t care. They didn\u2019t care that this policy would mean homeless students, and every day they still let it continue is a further sign that they don\u2019t care.\n\nThey have failed FSU as an educational institution and as a community.\n\nWhere is y\u2019all\u2019s sense of justice? I\u2019m talking to you who is reading this as a student, a faculty member, or as an alum. Get fucking mad! Y\u2019all should be mad! Fight this bullshit! Stand up for your community lest no one stand up for you! Do you think that change happened by people sitting on their thumbs? No! Let the president know what you think, talk to the news, get the word out!",

Which he was aware of on the first day of classes. He is very stressed about being behind in his classes and plans to seek a Calc tutor to catch up. \n\nAs a parent and FSU alumnus I am disappointed in how the school handled and is directed those working for them to handle students who contract covid on their watch.  Fsu offered zero assistance in finding room, board, transportation, or medical care at a time when students are extremely sick.  And expected to leave within hours of notice. In my son's case, he had less than 1 week of living away from home for the first time ever.  Classroom instruction must be available and accessible, even if only to students quarantined, so they don't fall behind as they are not incapacitated for most of the quarentined period. There is no valid excuse in my mind for these failures of decency and compassion to have occurred to my son while living on the FSU campus.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming marketing major and I scored past college algebra. I\u2019m a little concerned about taking business calc because I\u2019ve never taken calc or precalc and I took algebra 1 in 8th grade and algebra during Covid year online. What other math classes would you recommend and with who?",

It doesn't sound like that's your situation. \n\nWith that said, if you're feeling uncomfortable or unsure, you can always start with MAC1105 instead. If you're considering a business major, business calc isn't required until the second semester.",

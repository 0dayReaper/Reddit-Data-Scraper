I was wondering if anyone had good resources for the out of state waver since I having a hard time finding any info. Between that and fs4u, are there any other size able opportunities for non-Florida residents?",

The minimum enlistment period now is four years of active duty and four years inactive.  Then you pay instate.\n\nor\n\nYou can come to Florida and get a Driver's license, register to vote, sign a lease on a place to live and a get a  job with a paycheck. Work for   for 12 months and then submit a \"Florida Residency Declaration.\"  You will need all those documents , lease, paycheck stubs, voter registration card, driver's license.\n\nHowever\n\nThat still may not be enough,  you must also prove you are 100% independent from your out of state parents. i.e. receiving no financial support from them and no longer voting or living in that state. That can be trickey, but the best way to do that is to get married to someone who is instate.",

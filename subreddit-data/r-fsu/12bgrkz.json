    "postText": "Good morning everybody!\n\nI am coming to FSU in the fall for graduate schooling and I am looking for a place to stay. What are the going rates for 1 bedroom housing options? Is it doable? Is it better to live with someone else? Do you guys have any suggestions? I am really looking for any housing experiences and just any information in general regarding living in tally and life there as far as housing. Thanks in advance! \n\nI am from Florida and will be coming from Gainesville from UF, but I am not familiar with Tallahassee and I know the deadline for finding an affordable place is probably approaching. Distance is okay because I have a car and don\u2019t mind the drive provided the living situation is good. Nothing too long of course but I\u2019m sure you guys understand.\n\nThanks again!!!",

I couldn't get out of there fast enough. \n\nNow I live with my partner, he and I pay 820 total for a 2/1 at an off campus spot, its a lot nicer, I get to have my garden, a usable size kitchen, and an actual closet to store my clothes. \n\nWe're moving to a townhouse that's literally gorgeous for 1150/ month, also a 2/1, off campus. \n\nThe deals are there, you just have to look. Also having a chosen living companion is very helpful.",

This was my concern I guess with paying less because as much as I want to save $$ I don\u2019t want to completely compromise my peace of mind. Thanks again and happy to hear you and your partner found an awesome place :))",

I'm definitely very grateful to not be in that situation. \n\nIt's because those students usually don't have a car, but really you could buy a car with the money you spent on hiked up rent prices. Plus the further from campus you go it generally gets nicer and nicer. \n\nThe only problem I had was other places that aren't student housing don't lease as early as student living does. You can't get out of the loop lol. \n\nIf you're interested I almost got a 3/2 house for 1250/ month, (I picked the townhouse over the house because it's cheaper, cleaner, had a similar Sq ft even tho it has less bedrooms, and even tho the house backyard was bigger I liked the 2 story townhouse and I HATE galley kitchens with a passion.) But yeah I can send you the details of the leasing office and you can ask about the property. It's nice. \n\nEven if you're not interested, I bid you good luck on your search!",

            "comment": "Any student housing generally isn\u2019t great and is overly expensive unless you don\u2019t have a car and plan on being walking distance from the university. Some apartments I would suggest looking into include Arbor Crossing, Evergreen at Mahan, Eagles Landing(all are non student housing). A 1 bedroom/studio can cost you anything from 1200-1600 depending on the apartment. I would try to start to look for apartments ~6 months before you plan on moving in as availability is iffy sometimes. Hope this helps!",

    "postText": "Hello! I'm hoping someone in or who completed the MSI program can answer a quick question. And yes, I have reached out to the University, but I was hoping for additional insight from students. I am very interested in FSU's MSI online program (I live out of state), but my concern is the synchronous requirement of the courses. How strict is it? I've seen some say that attendance isn't always required, or that recordings can be available. My concern stems from the fact that I work full time; my job will likely be able to work with the schedule, but it will be tight. Thanks in advance!",

Each class is 1 night a week (Monday-Thursday) and is either 6p-8p or 8p-10p Eastern. Some classes did require mandatory attendance others did not but although some did not it was highly recommended to attend as some classes are broken out into learning half and working with your groups on the other. All of the classes are recorded and posted in Canvas.",

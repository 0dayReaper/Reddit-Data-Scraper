    "postText": "I\u2019m probably going to FSU starting in the fall as a PH major. Everyone says UF is a better STEM school and better for PH, but is FSU still good? With UF and FSU being such big public universities I feel like the STEM programs can\u2019t be that much different from each other. Can anyone in Public health or related majors tell me how it is? Thanks",

I know every single public health professor at UF and many at FSU.\n\nThe main difference is caliber of research. UF has incredibly talented research professors who can get you involved with any type of health research you want.\n\nFSU doesn\u2019t have very much public health research, and the professors are primarily hired as instructors not researchers.\n\nThe quality of classes is pretty much the same, the difference is your options to get further involved outside of class, which UF is better at.\n\nI much prefer FSU over UF as a university though, I\u2019m very glad to be leaving UF this semester. I miss FSU every day.",

            "comment": "The biggest thing to note about Public Health at FSU is that it is in the college of social sciences- it is social science and policy based. It is not like most other Public Health majors in the state in that it is not a STEM major and is not designed for things like students trying to do premed stuff. It is about the policy, administration, etc. side of public health. \n\nFSU public health is interdisciplinary and pulls in faculty and subject matter from across the university. It is also a relatively new \"stand alone\" program in that it launched in 2019 but is so well regarded by students that it jumped from 0 to 700+ students in less than 4 years. \n\nRe: research at FSU vs UF - FSU focuses on health policy research and is well known in that area. If you're looking for other types of health research, like medical research, that's a different emphasis than what you know find here in this program.",

                            "comment": "Those are great goals. Like others have said, the BSPH at FSU is more geared towards the policy, prevention/promotion side of things. The professors are great, and their research is more focused towards the sociological side of public health.  If that interests you, that\u2019s great. But if you want to go into epidemiology, I think supplementing with a bio or stats minor could be useful \n\nI\u2019m planning to apply for MPH/JD programs because I\u2019m interested in health law and policy. Many public health professionals usually have an MPH, but if you want to work for the CDC, def get started early on those internships and see what opportunities you can get with just your BSPH!",

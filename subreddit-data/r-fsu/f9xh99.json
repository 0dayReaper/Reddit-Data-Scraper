People have been filing lawsuits against the company since at least the 90\u2019s and the company is, like any other common MLM or \u201cdirect sales\u201d job, predatory (specifically towards college students in this case).  Another point, is Uber really the company you want to highlight? They seem to be under scrutiny constantly, which is deserving. Birds of a feather, I guess. Oh by the way, I don\u2019t appreciate you assuming I\u2019m an alcoholic because I\u2019m in college. That\u2019s completely baseless and flat out incorrect. (Just FYI I\u2019m working full time at a real job while taking four classes). Plus I\u2019d rather make honest money as a bartender or fast food worker than by exploiting family and friends to prop up your pyramid scheme; and maybe you shouldn\u2019t tear those people down? It\u2019s been my pleasure :)",

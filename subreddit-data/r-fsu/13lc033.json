(2015). *Public Relations: Strategies and Tactics* (11 th ed., Updated). Boston: Pearson.\u00a0\n\nIs there a subreddit on r/FSU for sharing textbooks?\n\nIf anyone could help me out that would be great,  I havent been able to find it for free online.",

Also, she gave two links to literally two different books with different covers, so it makes it even more confusing.\n\nEdit: Let me know if you find anything helpful! Thanks!",

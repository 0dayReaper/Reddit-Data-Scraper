            "comment": "You won't really have a choice of professors with THE2000 -- the main content was recorded by a professor who revamped the course a couple of years ago but was a visiting professor who's no longer in the department. Most of your communication will be with your TA; the head instructor (who last time I checked was also a grad student) only intervenes if there are issues. \n\nThere are no exams or papers, but weekly assignments/quizzes based on the module (I think they're all pretty easy, but you do usually have to actually watch the lecture videos for full points). Final assignment is making your own performance art video based on one of the performance art pieces you're given. I can't remember exactly, but I want to say it has to be around 3-5 minutes. \n\nI'd call it easy in terms of content, but it does require a time commitment. Based on the other comment, ARH2000 might be easier.",

                            "comment": "That's the thing I'm not a super big fan of, actually -- performance art isn't really what you think of as traditional theatre, and it's definitely what the course focuses on. It tends to be a lot weirder and more abstract, which can be really cool! -- but isn't everyone's jam. \n\nThe one that I remember most clearly is Nate Hill's \"Death Bear\" -- you can read a description [here](https://www.wnyc.org/story/11862-date-death-bear/), though the course includes videos that make it a little clearer. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZJl5i_zDw) one from WNYC on YouTube (not sure if it's the same one they use in the course or not, it's been a minute). \n\nSo for \"Death Bear\" the idea is that he \"goes door-to-door, removing items that trigger sad memories.\" So if you decide to use \"Death Bear\" for your final, you could do something like reverse it and leave small gifts for people you think will bring them joy, etc. It just has to be your own take on it with some connection to \"current events,\" but that last bit doesn't have to be political -- it can be like \"this study says 1 in 4 US college students struggle with depression, so I want to do a project that brightens my roommates' days,\" etc. \n\nYou're given four or five performance art pieces like this to choose from right at the beginning of the course and each module asks you to think about an aspect of the project, so it's kind of guided that way. You'll get feedback from the TAs on each step too (assuming you fill out that part of the quiz, lol).",

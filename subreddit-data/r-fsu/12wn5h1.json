I had friends starting in Summer B that did. their orientation at the end of May.\n\nKeep in mind the earlier you do your orientation, the better chances you\u2019ll have at getting preferred classes. You pick your schedule on the last day of orientation.\n\nI would call/email New Student and Family Services since they run orientation to get completely updated dates",

            "comment": "To my understand but I might be wrong, there's a certain order as to how they reduce your aid if your total aid (grant+scholarship+loans) &gt; cost of attendance. Yes, they will adjust your aid package if your total aid exceeds cost of attendance.\n\nAccording to common sense, one would suspect they will first reduce any loans on your aid, and then if your total aid is still greater than cost of attendance, then they'll proceed to reduce grants, and then scholarships.",

I have accessed my current financial aid for this upcoming fall through the Student financials page^ which is what\u2019s under review. There is also the budget worksheet which shows the projected cost but it\u2019s not an invoice \n\nThey did say 24-48 hours for the under review period but it\u2019s been like since Friday so I\u2019ve just been waiting.",

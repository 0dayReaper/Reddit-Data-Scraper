    "postText": "I'm staying in McCollum next year. Is there a small fridge in each room like in the regular dorms or is it 1 big fridge in the kitchen area? I know the actual rooms are smaller than the typical dorm, but is it that much of a bother? How is the laundry room there? How bad is the walk to campus? Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "McCollum is great! 1 big fridge in the kitchen area. The room sizes are not bad at all, honestly bigger than I thought they would be and huge windows which open the space up! Laundry room is usually never crowded and lots of machines but only a few dryers. Walk to campus can be 15-20 minutes mostly everywhere and depending how fast you walk. Honestly tough the first few times but not too bad once u get used to it, and I enjoy the cardio lol. Only really sucks in rain or when it\u2019s super hot outside. Most of the time it\u2019s fine.",

But I hate the A/C s system if you can even call it that. I like a cool temperature and it\u2019s so painfully hot in here at times, it\u2019s annoying, but can be dealt with. The walk is hell at first, but you get used to it. It\u2019s got some good views too, I never came to this side of campus last year and now I live here and it\u2019s fun. Parking is also unlimited here unless it\u2019s Gameday.",

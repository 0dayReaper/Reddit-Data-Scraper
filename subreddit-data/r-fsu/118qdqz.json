Everyone gets their own bedroom and bathroom, and there's a common kitchen and living room.  Laundry in unit.  Some have balconies.  I have a bedroom in a 3-BR unit available for August 2023 to July 2024, and I think the other bedrooms are available too, although I realize you inquired for a group of four.",

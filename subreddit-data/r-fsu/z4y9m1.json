Doesn\u2019t matter anyways, we\u2019re talking about this year not last year.\n\nWake Forest is much better than Navy, 7-5 vs 4-7. Fabien Lovett was out for the Wake Game, which was a killer on defense. Jared Verse and other guys were also banged up. \n\nGood luck against Tulane. If you win the next two, maybe you can print up some more off brand national champions tees",

I think next year should be a bit better as gus gets more settled. \n\nTBH FSU is my #2 team for FL. I will usually pull for FSU in your games. I am always happy when gators lose. Hope we get to have a matchup some time soon and hope we both have good teams that year so we can see it settled on the field :p",

    "postText": "I just realized that I need a 2000 level French course to graduate. I took French many years ago (am an older student) but remember the basics. I\u2019m supposed to graduate in the Spring 2024, and my schedule is pretty set for the Fall 2023 semester, and I cannot take Monday, Wednesday Friday courses this Fall. Just wondering if anyone knows what book is used for introductory or first year French at FSU. Does anyone know what\u2019s taught in the first year? I plan to review grammar and vocabulary over the summer break and fall semester. TIA!",

I did years ago for undergrad and the test itself is written comprehension, frankly not that difficult.

FRE2220 mostly followed the book with added online textbook assignments; you will also have writing compositions, presentations and some solo and partnered conversations for the professor. There are weekly practice responses and quizzes. Highly recommend Behi!",

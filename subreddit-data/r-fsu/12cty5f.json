Plus I know people that have traveled multiple times out of the country fully paid for by the program AND have gotten technology, clothes, housing, etc paid for. If you have bright futures, prepaid, or other scholarships you could truly be getting paid to go to school on top of these benefits. I would definitely choose FSU here. I chose FSU over UF Honors and have never looked back once. I feel like my hand is being held here whereas at UF I would have been thrown in with no help. Even just the honors program at FSU has an excellent community engagement element that UF is missing altogether. Im pretty sure UF Honors students only get to register early which FSU Honors students get too. I felt like FSU was showing me how great I can be if I allow them to help unlock my potential (which they have done in ways I couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine before college) whereas UF was showing me I should feel grateful to have a spot. My pres scholar friend at FSU was able to get an internship at the Florida House of Reps her first semester at FSU. Definitely more opportunities for your major here. BUT you should go with your gut! I know this decision seems scary but your heart will lead you to the right place! You can\u2019t possibly go wrong here.",

It's great for building connections across campus and with faculty who might not be in your department.

If you don\u2019t, Presidential Scholars is 100% the right choice; FSU\u2019s Political Science program is one of the best in the nation, with ample opportunity to branch into other fields with certificates such as our Emergency Management program, and proximity to the capital. Administrative support is also a huge factor, with a lot of opportunities to get internships within the university to set you up for a really interesting career. \n\nAt the end of the day, if we assume you\u2019ll spend four years in undergraduate, a lot of that time is used to transition into college. At UF, you will spend a year adjusting; at FSU, with Presidential Scholars, that transition period is significantly shortened, and you can maximize the impact you make on the institution, and more importantly, the impact the institution makes on you. \n\nFeel free to reach out if you want to talk more about your specific circumstances.",

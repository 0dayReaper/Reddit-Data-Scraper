    "postText": "I'm just surprised and confused about it. I just registered for orientation day, and it was paid, but some graduated students told me that their orientation day was not paid, and I just got to pick from 3 days, and if there is a bunch of new people, how can they make such small groups? Did I look for the wrong thing or is it how Orientation Day works? Because it says that I can register without participating on that day.",

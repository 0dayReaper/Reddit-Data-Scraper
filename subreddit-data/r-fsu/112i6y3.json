If anybody has an idea of what type of dorms will be available (I wouldnt be able to apply for housing until around mid may) that would be great! Also, what off campus apartments are best? Im not taking my car up so itd have to be close enough for walking/biking distance. Thank you so much!!! :)",

It's at my renewal rate of $925 plus fees and utilities (probably another $65 or so), way below the rate of $1,115 plus fees and utilities that the building is charging new tenants.  Top-notch building, desirable C2 floor plan, great location.  August 2023 to July 2024.",

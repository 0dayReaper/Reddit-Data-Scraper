    "postText": "Hello I'm an incoming freshman and I'm unsure whether I should go with the FGEN Noles LLC (Wildwood hall) or the Entrepreneurship LLC (Deviney Hall). I'm leaning toward the Entrepreneurship LLC because I think I'd prefer to live in Deviney but I am in CARE and the FGEN Noles LLC is an extension of CARE so maybe I should go with that one. If anyone could give me some advice (such as their experience in either) I'd appreciate it.",

I absolutely love it, I\u2019ve enjoyed the classes, met SOOOOOO many people, got a part time job because of it and am learning the in-s and out-s of a small business, but most of all I\u2019ve made a TON of friends, a few of which I think I have the potential to be lifelong. \n\nDo what you think is best for you, but I 100% recommend the entrepreneurship LLC",

The other two are one semester each, and while I have personally enjoyed them, some others feel differently. Those two classes heavily focus on having open conversation about a variety of topics. It\u2019s definitely cool, and the work for both of those isn\u2019t terribly hard either.",

It\u2019s pretty similar in layout to Wildwood but the lighting in the rooms and the hallway designs are nicer, plus the building being newer means less maintenance issues with the building. Wildwood is perfectly fine, though, and it\u2019s closer to Pensacola Garage, Doak, the Leach, and the ASLC than Deviney, if those are of any value to you. I\u2019d still probably go for Deviney, but Wildwood is not bad",

Regardless, the context of the message does matter - it was a Catholic groupchat and in the context of the Bible, those things are sins. Personally, I'm not Christian and think it's ridiculous. However, so long as he isn't trying to force his beliefs on others, I could care less. Moreover, this discussion was in the confines of a private chat, it wasn't a public statement. He hasn't directly harassed individuals for their beliefs (to my knowledge). I disagree with him, but fail to see me disagreeing with him as grounds for impeachment.",

Additionally, Denton has been known to interact negatively with transgender individuals in real life, repeatedly invalidating, misgendering, and dead naming a fellow senator who is trans. That individual spoke out against Denton in the senate meeting on Wednesday. I think these reasons allowed people to make the connection between his \u201cgrave evils\u201d comment and his comment about transgender individuals more strongly than his anti-abortion beliefs or thoughts on police funding, however he IS referring to all three as grave evils in his comment.",

    "postText": "Hello! After a lifetime of struggle, I finally got an ADHD diagnosis yesterday. I want to talk to OAS about an accommodation involving deadline extensions (no matter how many alarms I have, how many planners and notes I have on the back of my hand, I always miss deadlines for online assignments and remember about them within a couple hours of them being due/late). Does anyone have something similar? Is that even an available accommodation? Would love to hear experiences with OAS.",

I got my diagnosis/prescription from my neurologist rather than a mental health professional, so it doesn't go into great detail about my ailments, just treatment.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I recently been accepted to the criminology program at FSU and wanted to ask those who do full time work and attend FSU full time is it hard? how is your social life? When I completed my AA I was both working full time and attending college full time and it was stressful but manageable, but then i started to take tuesdays and thursdays off to concentrate in classes and i started to work part time, sometimes a little over 60 hours every two weeks. I recently got a great job offer 8-5 mon-friday , no weekends, and I dont mind taking some night classes or online. I just want to know some of you all\u2019s experiences doing this while attending FSU. \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I worked full time at FSU during my undergrad but the biggest courseload I took at one time was 9 hours. It was manageable but stressful. I could've done 12 hours but that would've been my whole life outside of work. I ended up taking a few CLEP tests so that I could graduate on time without having to go full time as a student. \n\nI work in an office on campus now where my admin assistant is full time in her job and full time in a WAY more challenging program than I was. She takes advantage of a decent amount of downtime in her position where she can get things done, but even so, I'm amazed she makes it work. \n\nCrim is not a terribly hard major in terms of the workload. If you've done it successfully before, you can probably do it now. My advice for your mental health and your social life is to drop it to 9 hours every semester (including summers) and you would only need one extra semester if you're starting from a true 60 hours.",

Make sure to let your advisor know what your work situation is and they can help you draft a schedule that will accommodate your hours.",

            "comment": "I graduated last year after attending FSU full anywhere from 3/4 to full time. The lowest amount of credits I took per semester was 9. I also worked an 8-5 state job. I graduated Cum Laude. It is possible. It was only possible for me because I was attending during the Covid era when classes were all online. This allowed me to be able to take my classes without leaving my work desk and putting up my \"in a meeting\" message. During that time period, I was able to maximize my semester and take the full 12 to 15 credits; however, when classes started to meet in person again, I had to cut my course load down to 9 with some extreme measures like adjusting my work schedule to allow me to be able to attend those classes. FSU is not designed for students who work full time. They offer very few night classes and even fewer weekend classes. Of course, this also depends on what your degree field is. I was even cautioned in the beginning by my advisor that I may not be able to complete the degree because of the availability of classes to fit around my work schedule. \n\n In the end, I was able to do it, successfully, but I certainly was not able to take the classes I was really interested in or would have been more in line with my degree field, and had to instead opt for classes that were available as either their \"night\" classes which started at like 430 or 5, or what I could find as online courses. My grades didn't suffer, but I don't feel like I got as much out of those classes, and my educational experience was vastly different than what it could have been. I also missed out on being able to participate in any of the FSU functions or really getting to know my professors or fellow classmates. This also hurts if you are planning on taking your education further, since you will need letters of recommendation from your professors. As I was only \"in seat\" for 2 semesters and actually only physically met 3 of my professors, I was nothing more than a name on paper and felt like it would be pointless to ask for any letters of recommendation from them. \n\nThe best advice if you are planning to go this route - working fulltime while attending FSU fulltime - lower your expectations.",

            "comment": "It's recommend that you take 15 credit hours a semester. Working full-time and doing well is going to be tough. I took 15ch and worked 20 hours a week, plus active club participation. Life was busy to say the least. During grad classes, I did 4 classes and worked full-time, little easier because even though head classes are more detailed, there is less busy work, not necessarily turning in papers every week.",

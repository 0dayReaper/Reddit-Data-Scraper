    "postText": "I thought that the 12th week of the semester ended this week, not last week, and now the deadline has passed for me to withdraw from a course that I\u2019ve been doing horrible in. Is there anyway that I can withdraw from this course even after the deadline if I just plead my case? I\u2019m currently on scholarship so this one class would drop my gpa to a level that would make me ineligible for it so I need this course to be withdrawn.",

            "comment": "Unfortunately, after the 12th week deadline, especially if it's more than the first business day past the deadline, you'll almost certainly have to pursue a drop through the medical/mental health or the administrative/personal hardship route, either of which requires documentation and justification more than wanting to preserve the GPA for any reason. \n\nYour academic deans office - note the academic deans office, not the actual dean of a college - would be who you have to talk about that too, but unless you can show some documentation for why you missed the deadline, it's pretty standard to say it's too late for a late drop",

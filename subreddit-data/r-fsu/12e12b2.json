It had an incredible culture that I couldnt find in other schools. UF felt boring, UCF was a glorified commuter school, UM was just overpriced, USF was just lame. But FSU was everything I wanted it to be. What kept me there was my friends and the fun atmosphere. Not to mention I had a niche major not offered at most schools.",

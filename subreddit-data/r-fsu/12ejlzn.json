            "comment": "You probably don't need someone telling you that it'll be hot if you plan on visiting soon, but be prepared for the humidity and potential random thunderstorm. Definitely wear some good walking shoes and stay hydrated for the campus tour! And also just be aware that any campus dining will be 110% better on the days that tours are happening, so keep that in mind if your son wants to consider a larger meal plan. Also if any tour guide says that there is plenty of parking on-campus, they are LYING!!!!!!!! It's free to park, but you *can* park for personal parking spots if you want to drop a few hundred. Otherwise, parking is competitive on campus and if you plan on parking at Woodrow, get there *early*. But, some suggestions:\n\n* Food and restaurants: Collegetown has some good spots. The Madison for drinks and pub food, Little Masa for Asian fusion (think chipotle bowls but better with less risk of food poisoning), and Isabella's Pizzeria. Outside of Collegetown, I would absolutely 110% recommend Backwoods Crossing. It's closer toward Monticello, but it has amazing fresh-Southern cuisine. Definitely get the crab cakes there. I would also recommend Kool Beanz Cafe. They change their menu daily so check out their FB, but really good place to go. And try out Lucky Goat Co if you want to get coffee. They have several locations and they're locally owned! \n* Things to do: Wakulla springs. It's a bit out of town, but it is one of the most beautiful natural springs and state parks IMO in Florida. They offer boat tours and it's honestly such a delight being out there. I would also check out Cascades park if you want to look at the greenery and such. The Automobile museum is also neat to check out--a lot of vintage cars and historical stuff. The Florida History Museum is also something to check out, but they may be closed depending on when you visit. \n* On the campus: Check out the library and the student union. The student union finally finished construction ~~after 87 years~~ and they have a bowling alley, lots of restaurants, and they hold fun little music and art shows sometimes. ALSO check out the circus!!! Spring time/April is when the FSU circus holds performances and they are AMAZING. Wednesday is market day where a bunch of market vendors come to campus and sell cool stuff, I'd check that out as well.",

            "comment": "FSU student here-- You can't go wrong with dining around collegetown. Tin Lizzy's, Little Masa, and Madison Social are all good picks. You could also try out Gordos on W Pensacola St which has great Cuban food + atmosphere. Kool Beans Cafe has excellent food with menus they usually change up every day. Nagoya is a little further but good if you want hibachi. Harry's Seafood Bar and Grill has amazing food but make sure to call in a reservation as it gets busy. The Edison also has excellent food and gives a nice laid back atmosphere at a nice restaurant. Bird's Aphrodisiac Oyster Shack is great if you are into seafood and oysters. Iron Daisy if you would like some great reasonably priced tacos. Nelson's Burger Shack also has some great burgers.",

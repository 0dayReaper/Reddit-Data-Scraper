    "postText": "So I recently got accepted for the summer semester, the CARE program and the honors college too.\n\nI was so excited at first bc I hadn\u2019t considered fsu as a possibility until that point a few days ago, but I\u2019m starting to worry abt finances. I was under the assumption the CARE was a \u2018full cost of attendance for four years\u2019 sort of scholarship but I\u2019ve read it only pays for the summer semester part of the program in full. I\u2019ve also read some posts from a while ago that say you receive some amount of grants for being a part of the program during fall and spring semesters? Idk \nI have the Florida FAS scholarship and another that would pay for roughly a years and semester or so of tuition, but I would hate to turn down fsu due to cost.\n\nAdditionally, how\u2019s the engineering program here? I applied for civil engineering and I can\u2019t find much on the quality of professors, internships in the field, getting jobs (and so on) from this sub for the major, much less the school much less anywhere else.\n\nIf there are any people in these programs that could give some insight I\u2019d definitely appreciate it!\n\nAlso one more minor thing, can undergrads volunteer in of of the college of engineering out reach programs? I\u2019d want to get involved while studying since stem outreach is something I\u2019m passionate about.",

            "comment": "Cant speak on engineering but I'm in CARE and believe me, its such a great experience and the financial benefits are extremely generous. You do get a CARE grant for 2500 per year, but you also get automatically qualified for other Florida grants due to just being in CARE (and based on the status of your FAFSA and how early you submit it.) My freshman year I qualified for a First-gen matching grant, which CARE students get priority on. There's also a wealth of scholarship opportunities you can look into through the program. CARE is like, 90% of the reason I even chose FSU and I highly recommend it. DM me if you have any questions!",

Most professors within the college are great. The shared program with Famu sets it apart from others imo. \n\nDo you have bright futures? I got the full award and other grants of the sort, I think they give you one for being a stem major too",

            "comment": "I got my degree in engineering and I often tutor students who are in CARE, but don't know the ins and outs of the program. You have to speak to a financial aid advisor about there. I am sure it is someone's specific job to answer the question you have.\n\nAnyway, our engineering program is excellent. It is the only program in America that is shared with another university, and I like the diversity. Personally I hate the building it is in but it's also way easier to park and the research buildings are all gorgeous.\n\nThere's so many opportunities for you to get involved as an undergrad. You're legitimately going to be overwhelmed by how many different clubs and organizations the college of engineering has. Just go to the involvement fair.",

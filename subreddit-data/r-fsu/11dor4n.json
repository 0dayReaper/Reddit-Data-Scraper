    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI am a second year student at FSU trying to do a the Summer 2023 semester online at home. \n\nFor Bright Futures to pay my tuition, I need 6 credit hours. I still need to take ENC2135, so that's 3 there, but I'm looking for one more class to take online.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there any way I can search for ONLY online classes? \n\nIf not, does anyone have any recommendations? I like learning languages (although I doubt any of the language classes would be online) , I enjoy math/science and am interested in a STEM major so I wanted to take some intro STEM classes. \n\nI haven't settled on a major yet, btw. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "The best way to search for classes is through the \"old\" class search, not the new schedule assistant version (but I may also be biased). Go to myfsu &gt; Student center &gt; Class search. After picking the correct semester, you can search one of two ways:\n\n1. Under Course Attribute, select Physical Location and under Course Attribute Value, select Online.\n2. If that wasn't programmed in correctly when the department was building the class, you can also go to Additional Search Criteria and under Delivery Mode, select 100% Online.\n\nYou can obviously through any other filters on there that you want like if it counts for a Gen Ed requirement. Class search also lets you search for classes in just a specific department instead of by course code, like schedule assistant. That's useful since some departments use more than one code or some codes are shared between departments, and some majors like humanities or social sciences need classes from specific departments.",

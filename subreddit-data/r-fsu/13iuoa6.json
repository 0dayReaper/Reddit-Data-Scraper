    "postText": "I lost my bright futures scholarship last spring (2022) and didn't have it this entire year. I was told I could get it back after my next spring semester or until I got my GPA back up to 2.75 or above. I had the highest amount before but couldn't get it back up above 3.0. It is at a 2.8 right now, how do I get the award back? I know I can still get the one FMS (75%), but who do I contact to start this process? Thanks!",

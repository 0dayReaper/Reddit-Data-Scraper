    "postText": "I just received my acceptance letter for FSU and I love everything about it except I also just got a job where I live in tampa. I am looking to get a degree in finance. Here\u2019s the situation:\n\nFSU:\nI love everything about it and have a full ride b/c bright futures scholarship\nPlenty of friends going here, and the status of going to a prestigious school\n\nUSF\nFull ride plus 3k per year for presidential scholarship\nI get to keep my job, which pays extremely well and I don\u2019t think I will find anything like it anywhere else. It is not a remote job however. I will have 5 years of experience in the industry out of college as well, and likely be working here afterwords as a financial advisor.\nI really don\u2019t like the campus, and the atmosphere and culture is not what I am looking for. Plus it\u2019s a commuter school so little party life.\n\nI know this is a very small problem and sounds like a whiny kid question, but I thought FSU reddit could help.",

You only get one college experience, and I promise you that whatever amount you can make staying in Tampa will not outbalance a bad college experience. If you don\u2019t like USF, don\u2019t go to USF just for money. It\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be in any debt either way since you have full-rides.\n\nWhich do you think you\u2019ll value more in 20 years, memories of a college you like, or more in a bank account that\u2019s already probably at 500k anyway (since Finance pays well).\n\nConsider it your first decision in finance. Staff happiness vs. company profits, which is more important to you?",

Every class whether it\u2019s business or STEM is made far harder than it needs to be, there is very little support, everything is hyper-competitive, and the general mentality from professors is \u201cdrop out then if you don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nThere was a managerial accounting test last week that the business students have been very freaked out about, and most of them failed. There was a biochemistry test this week that had large groups of people literally crying in the library, and they still failed. Pre-meds are nearly all depressed verging on dropping out. Four years of that destroys people.\n\nThe university has taken the path of doing what\u2019s best for their rankings, not what\u2019s best for their students. It feels like all admin cares about is getting the top 5 public ranking, and if students have to suffer for it, so be it.",

Every top student in Florida goes to UF they are so used to being the top student everyone is competing to be the best student. Compared to FSU, people do well academically but the culture behind how well you do in your classes isn\u2019t has harsh. I know someone who transferred from FSU to UF and they said the people here at FSU are much nicer. I the m if your looking to have good academics and a good social life and meet new people I would go with FSU. If you\u2019re really focused on academics I would say UF. I think FSU has a much nicer campus visually and structurally it\u2019s also much more walkable compared to UF, there are so many roads that is why there are so many mopeds there. And I feel like there a more of a community at FSU compared to UF.",

If an emergency expense comes up, do you have support that can bail you out, etc? If the answer is yes, then work and money (at this time in your life) should not be a factor. FSU would be a fun place and you\u2019ll get a great education. If, however, you come from a situation where money is tight and you don\u2019t have a support system, you need to stay where you can make great money now AND get a quality education/career path set up. Partying is fun, you know what is more fun? Being able to pay your bills and not going hungry. Buckle down for a few years and be a homebody if you gotta so you can set yourself up for a better future. USF it is.\n\nMy two cents.",

I come from north of Tampa (New Port Richey area) and am very familiar with USF and I know what you mean about the campus and college experience. Its not great. But, ill break from other commenters who said as long as you arent in debt go to FSU and say that it is good to have money when you graduate, and better to have industry experience. My suggestion (if your scholarships allow this) would be to spend the next ~2 years in Tampa, working at that job and getting experience and an AA. Then at the end of your two years you can either continue at USF if you dont hate it, or transfer to FSU with an associates and benefit from taking your major classes at our business college and still have a good 2 years in Tallahassee. Whatever you choose I dont think youll look back at the end and think you made the wrong choice, but perhaps USF then FSU is worth considering. Best of luck in whatever you choose",

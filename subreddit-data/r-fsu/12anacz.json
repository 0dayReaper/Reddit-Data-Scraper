            "comment": "As someone who took COP3014 online, and basically every other CS class in person, COP3014 is several orders of magnitude easier online than in person CS classes, and you may learn more as well. This does depend on the professors somewhat, but if you are talking about fall Gyang is just not a good teacher in any way, you are already better of taking it online, and especially if you can get the online class with Romero I really enjoyed it. Now however you take it there is a lot of work, but I wouldnt say its particularly hard work. Especially if whatever online class you are in uses ZyBooks, then every assignment and project in the course you can do infinite times till you get 100%, so its really easy to get an A if you actually take the time to learn it. I also had 0 programming experience going into COP3014 and finished it over a summer with probably 3-4 hours of work a week and a 99% in the class, so its definitely very doable. Best of luck with whatever you end up with!",

From looking at some of the assignments and her interactions with him ill say the assignments are unneccesarily complicated and a little bit weird/unclear, and in that class specifically there are a lot of things that you are required to do in ways that make 0 sense. I dont know how any/all of that translates to the COP3014 class, but ill say my impression is that hes a good guy but a mediocre online teacher. Id still prefer him over An Tyson or Nyeng Gyang any day of the week though.\n\nWorst comes to worst if you struggle with his teaching style freecodecamp has a C++ tutorial for beginners video on youtube, if you can watch that video and understand everything in it you will get a 100% in that class, it is a semester in 4 or less hours.",

It might be easier in 3014.\n\nPersonally, I'd take it with Dr.Works if you can. Her lectures are good and she gives lots of example code. Her instructions are not always clear though. Gaitros rambles and kinda expects you to get everything from the book.",

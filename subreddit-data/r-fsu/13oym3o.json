    "postText": "I feel like it\u2019s pretty expected for parents to go to their kids freshman orientation, but I\u2019m transferring in as a junior so I feel like it would be a little weirder. Do a lot of peoples parents go to transfer orientation? I live somewhat far from FSU so it would be convenient if my parents came, but I don\u2019t want them to be bored and waiting around for an entire day. I would rather go alone. Are there a lot of parents or mostly just students there?",

They have presentations and other stuff for the parents to do during the day, so they definitely won\u2019t just be sitting around waiting for you to get done.",

Orientation was a waste of time for me, yes we walked around the pretty campus, and I made sure where my kid was going to live was reasonably safe.  Otherwise it was a field trip day.  We stayed in a hotel and spent 10 hours in a car.\n\nIf its not a hardship let them come.  It for them much more than for you.  THey will have stuff for them to do and they can buy appropriate 'Nole merch for parents.  Kind of a last Hoorah if you will.",

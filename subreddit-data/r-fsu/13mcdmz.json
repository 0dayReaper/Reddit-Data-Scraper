    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman majoring in economics, pretty interested in math as well and I\u2019d like to take some sort of multivariable during my first year. I recently took my AP Calc BC exam but won\u2019t get results until July 5, my orientation is in late June. Do I have to take the test since I can\u2019t bring proof of my passing score to orientation, or can I wait? I think the answer is no, I\u2019ll likely earn credit for the exam, but I want to make sure.",

            "comment": "Taking the ALEKS won't hurt anything. The issue with not taking it is you can't register for a math higher than MAC1105 until you have something on file showing you qualify for it - either the ALEKS or your AP credit. So if you don't take the ALEKS, you'll have to wait for your AP scores to post to register for a higher level math in Fall. \n\nWith that said, if that's something you're comfortable doing, that's perfectly fine as well. You can just make sure your scores post then get an updated schedule from your advisor.",

Which makes sense since the test only covers up to precalc/trig. Thank you for your help though!",

If your AP scores are coming in after orientation, you will need to take ALEKS before registering for those math classes. Side note: the test itself is very easy if you have a firm grasp of algebra 2 and trigonometry! It only took me 30 minutes to finish and I got a 98 on my first try. Give it a go :)",

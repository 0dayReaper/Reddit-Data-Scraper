Before coming to FSU I was at Daytona State College, which I chose as it had the 2nd best online classes in 2014.\n\nThey had many classes remote and local mixed sections, live streamed cams and computer screens.  Excellent web portal, distance advising, etc.\n\nThe extra fee per online class?  Just $20.",

But here's a way to get started on that. GAU has created a form letter that you can personalize and a list of university contacts to send it to. Fill this out, send it in, spread it around to all your friends, to your parents, to anyone who's paying the fees we shouldn't need to pay, to faculty and staff who might be sympathetic, and to anyone else I've missed. If the people who actually make these decisions start hearing from enough of us, they may actually move. Especially if the campaign gets large enough that they have to acknowledge it's happening.\n\nSo [here is the letter](https://fsugau.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2632d0b8f9cebaad5c9c06fce&amp;id=c8ffa6b7c7&amp;e=fc426d078a). And [here are some ideas on who to send it to](https://fsugau.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2632d0b8f9cebaad5c9c06fce&amp;id=eaba97784a&amp;e=fc426d078a). If you have other ideas for contacts, or other ideas for how to push fee relief, we'd love to hear them! You can PM me here or email info@fsugau.org.",

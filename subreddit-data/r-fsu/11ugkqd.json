I hail from India and am looking for a group of south asian students - preferably Grad seniors - who I can connect with for information about the city, accommodations etc. I\u2019ll be moving to Tallahassee for the first time and this could be helpful. Any virtual community (WhatsApp group for instance) that I can join? Kindly refer/DM.",

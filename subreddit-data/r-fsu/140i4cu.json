    "postText": "I\u2019m going down to fsu for my freshman orientation and I wanted to know whether I should bring a suitcase or backpack with all my stuff in it. Also, should I bring bed sheets and a pillow because I think I saw some people saying that you should bring them. If there\u2019s anything else that I should bring that wasn\u2019t listed on the website, let me know.\n\nThanks",

And kids also bring a small backpack, to put in flyers, booklets and stuff they give out . Also she put her laptop in the backpack. She used it on the last day to sign up for classes .",

My year, I took a duffel bag for clothes/toiletries/linens/a pillow and I also took a backpack that was mostly empty since you get a bunch of handouts. Also, don't forget hand soap and towels, they were not provided my year lol",

    "postText": "Hello! I'm a grad student, and was told by my advisor that I need to obtain instructor permission to take one of my required courses online over summer. I emailed this professor last Tuesday and haven't heard anything. I let my advisor know, and she said there's nothing she can do. I know it's a busy season so I don't want to be pushy, but this delay is preventing me from setting my work schedule among other personal things. How long should I wait before emailing for a follow up?",

Please give us a little bit of extra time to answer emails, as we are calculating final grades, which are due on Tuesday at 4 PM.\n\nOur brains are not able to handle anything regarding next semester just yet\u2026 we need to get through this one first.\n\nPerhaps follow up next week if you don\u2019t hear anything.",

Unfortunately students are only a small percentage of faculty responsibilities. Even when I was enrolled in a class, the professor never answered my emails. To get a response from some, I had to physically go find them. Keep an eye on end of semester dates. Once professors are out for the summer all bets are off for sure. If I had it to do over, I would have never attended",

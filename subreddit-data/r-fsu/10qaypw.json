    "postText": "Hey please don\u2019t come to lecture if you\u2019re going to talk through it. In a lecture hall there is an echo so it\u2019s easy to hear people even upstairs. Some of us have sensory issues so it feels like everyone in the hall is shoulder to shoulder whispering in your ear while you\u2019re trying to focus. Imagine having ADHD on top of that. It can cause panic attacks. I really don\u2019t want to miss a lecture because of a panic attack due to rude students. Not only is it rude to everyone else but it\u2019s rude to the professor. Please think of others.",

            "comment": "I agree its rude to speak during a lecture but not because it can trigger a panic attack. Thats like saying you shouldn't hug a random stranger because they might have ocd. I'm not considering ocd really since I still offer strangers handshakes (but I guess that might be different since they can still refuse to shake my hand). This is probably unrelated to the original post, but how much are people morally obligated to inconvenience themselves in the case of rare outlier scenarios. Is it wrong to eat peanuts in public? Is it wrong to wear revealing clothing because it might disturb a religious person? Sorry for the ramble but you stimulated all these thoughts. I also have ADHD so ya people talking is annoying especially when I already have difficulties paying attention in silence because of all the thoughts swirling in my head. I also went through panic attacks before so I get the concern.",

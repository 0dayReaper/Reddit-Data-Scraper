    "postText": "Hi guys, so since my housing date is coming up and Degraff seems to be the only building available with rooms, I wanted to know if anyone knew what the 3-4 people per room, rooms looked like. I know the school tends to give them their own bathroom and it\u2019s a little bigger but that\u2019s all I know. Any information would be appreciated:)",

On FSU housing it only lists doubles and singles in Degraff. Degraff isn\u2019t that bad but I would definitely either stay in West or in one of the rooms that doesn\u2019t face the Strip. The walls are very thin so you will hear everything on the street at night.",

            "comment": "AFAIK DeGraff\u2019s triples are akin to most of the other triples in other halls. Specifically I\u2019d compare it to MADD or Cawthon, as those tend to be the most regular shaped and consistent in floor plan. They tend to be in the corner or on the end of the hallway. Triples will either have their own bathroom or share with a double. Triples are about 1.5x the size of the average double room. I don\u2019t believe Housing offers 4-people-per-room spaces. (Apartment style gives each resident their own room but a shared kitchen.) \n\nThe exact floor plan for every building is available online if you want an exact layout.",

I say Wildwood because it\u2019s built at the same time and basically the same layout. Known for bigger rooms and sharing bathrooms between suites of 4 ppl/2 rooms. Not the worst, I think the location gets a bad rep bc it\u2019s across Tennessee street but it\u2019s hella close to the College of Business, Union, Strozier, Landis, etc. Also, if you\u2019re into partying the Strip is literally next door. No more ubering home lol. Just carry some pepper spray bc I\u2019ve seen some sketchy ppl near the McDonald\u2019s lol.",

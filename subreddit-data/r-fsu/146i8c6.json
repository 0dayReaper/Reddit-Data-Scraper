    "postText": "Hello! I'm (21F) looking for a place to live in close to but not too close to campus.\n\nThe last place I lived in was broken into during broad daylight so I'm really scared of having my place getting broken into again. I also want to live in alone because living with roommate sucks. Can anyone recommend anywhere I should avoid/look at but also doesn't cost an arm and a leg?\n\nI saw some 1/1 townhouses on Ocala, also some on Tharpe, Hartsfield and Pensacola towards the west. Can I know if these places are safe to live alone or should I look elsewhere? Any experience to share would be appreciated. Thanks!",

Anything 1/1 or 2/2, unless it\u2019s in a shitter, is probably gonna cost you at least 600-700 depending on how close to campus you want to live. The closer you live, the higher the price, sometimes going to 1200 or more.",

Nowhere in Tallahassee is really \u201csafe,\u201d there are just safer places than others. I would suggest living as close to campus as possible. Stay away from places like Hayden road, Jackson Bluff, Appleyard, Ocala, Belle Vue, Atkamire, Lipona, etc. Honestly, stay away from any neighborhoods South and West of the stadium. As for North of the stadium, avoid any houses that are on streets that are named after states, and do not live in French Town. Your best bet is finding an apartment complex like NXNW, The Osceola (they have furnished studios for less than $900), and any other enclosed apartment complexes. You may want to consider looking into any studio apartments; you are more likely to find a studio within your price range than you would a true 1 bed 1 bath apartment.

It\u2019s not the best but it could be far worse \u2014 you get what you pay for. I honestly would have moved out by now but this is the only place within my budget that wouldn\u2019t require me to live with roommates. \n\nManagement is responsive and maintenance guy that comes around the property is pretty chill. No issues there. Most issues I\u2019ve had with people have all been drunk people going to or from the frat houses, so no issues with anyone who actually lives on the property.",

            "comment": "Living alone has risks but may I highly suggest these wyze cameras. They are cheap and even have Ai that recognize people, animals, cars and packages.  You can share them with family especially ones pointed at ur door.  They run like $35-45 each and then you put an sdcard in them just to have more memory for videos. There is a cloud option. It alerts my phone whenever someone comes to my door. I have it set for people detection and pointed out the window to\nMy front stoop. I also have some around just so I know there's motion inside my place. It even has flood lights and a siren built in.  The night vision is very good so it sees color in the dark.\nWe have kinda gotten addicted to them especially when we travel. People notice them and I think figure they should move on to the next place. The ones that movr and do tracking are scary because you feel like you are being watched by the terminator! I think those freak people out. They aren't for outdoor though only the still cubes are.  We also got the light bulbs and door lock. So when we unlock the door it turns on lights inside and takes a quick video from all cameras. We wrote a script for this in the app. Took like 1min to learn. \n\nThe Cube cameras have a magnetic base and legs and kinda look like Wally from that movie. The little space\nRobot. Seriously people know they are being recorded and never mess with anything we have. \n\nAlso amazon packages have been safe and we are alerted immediately. Also all cameras have 2 way audio in case someone comes to the door and you need to talk or someone breaks in and you want to mess with them.",

Funny story, I was sick of having packages stolen so I bought a set of ring camera but it got stolen as well and amazon refused to do anything since there was a photo proof of the package being delivered. \n\nBeen looking to buy another set buy too expensive.",

You can set the interval from 15s to 15min on lights staying on.   The app is ok. Again it serves its purpose and it's cheap. You can even order flood lights for the little cameras. Just get a couple and play with it. I love the remote\nDeadbolt. I can literally open my door from asia. Also even if someone picks the lock and opens the door it alert you!  The cube cameras also\nCome\nWith like a metal circle and stickum so you can put the metal anywhere and the base of the camera is magnetic. Honestly for a cheapo camera it has a ton. Get one off Amazon to test but in bulk it's better direct, it's a bit cheaper.  My shocker was when a it caught a rat coming to say hi where the laundry machine was and alerted me \"pet\" and I was out of town and like wth... then I saw it and was freaked out. Told it when it sees anything so the lights and siren. I think the ray got scared off. Maybe. I hope.",

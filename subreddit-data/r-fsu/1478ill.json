I\u2019ve already gotten my AA and I wanted to return to FSU (im still enrolled if I register for summer classes) and stay in the major I was in previously, but I found out I actually can\u2019t apparently because I\u2019m missing prerequisites. Now I only have a few majors available to me, none of which I am particularly interested in. Do i seriously have to get a degree in one of those majors to go to FSU? Going to FSU is the best option for me right now but I don\u2019t want to be stuck in a major that I hate or that wont get me a job(apparently). The advisor I talked to said I have to consider a different school if I want to be a stat major &gt;.&lt; Is there really no way I can change it later? I dont mind if it takes a bit longer, I just dont want to be trapped :/ thank you",

She only needed 27 credits from FSU to graduate with that one (Ironically you need 30 from FSU or they can't award a degree) so yes absolutely you can have pre requisites for two degrees.

Two years in and advising is saying she is making unsatisfactory academic progress despite having accumulated 180 credits, completed all IA degree requirements and well into upper division engineering. She\u2019s had 15 credits a semester and classes last summer snd now.  She should be just a sophomore and we are waiting for Simone in advising or financial aide to explain what satisfactory progress would actually look like.  \nAll that said advising isn\u2019t infallible.  Sit down map out a plan that makes sense and follow through.  In the end you pick your classes and if you do well you will be admitted to almost any major that is not seriously impacted (forget about film school for example) be careful that you plan to graduate under your excess credit hour requirement or it will get pricey.  \nThe college is really pushing 4 year graduation as this influences ratings.  It\u2019s good because you don\u2019t want to be hanging out for 7+ years but sometimes it comes off like they want to limit you in order to meet that goal.  If you can show a departmental advisor a plan that has you graduate under the excess credit threshold then you should be ok.",

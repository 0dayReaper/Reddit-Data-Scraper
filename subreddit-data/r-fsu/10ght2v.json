    "postText": "Currently an undergraduate applicant for FSU's 2023 summer term. Logged into my application status page to find out that my Residency status is out of state, which is very weird considering that every other Florida university I applied to considered me as an in-state student.\n\nI believe I provided the correct documentation to prove my Florida residency status. Either way, a new tab appeared on my application checklist: \"Residency supporting documentation.\" \n\nI don't understand, do they want me to provide more provided ASIDE from the documents I've already given them? (Father's driver's license, vehicle registration, and utility bills). This also worries me because I submitted my CARE application and completed its respective checklist, which I know is only available to Florida Residents. I feel like they screwed me over and their gonna move me to the rolling decision pool.\n\nI went onto their admissions website and couldn't find any useful information. Does anyone know what to do???",

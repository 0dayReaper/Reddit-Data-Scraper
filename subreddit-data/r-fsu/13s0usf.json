    "postText": "ok i don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me, but i\u2019ve just become extremely frustrated with this school. it feels like there\u2019s little to no support from guidance (i\u2019ve tried to get help from 3 different departments, can\u2019t even get a response to a fucking email), these professors seem to either have no clue what they\u2019re doing/are just straight up jerks, and so many of the programs are just a mess (public health especially). i hate to say it, but it feels like fsu just lost its touch in the last 2 years, it doesn\u2019t feel like the school i toured and fell in love with in high school anymore. i just finished my second year here, and honestly i wish i could go back and do it all over again at another university. \n\ni\u2019m sorry if this comes off as whiny, but i\u2019ve been wanting to get this off my chest for a while now and want to know if anyone else is feeling the same way.",

Professors have even arranged calls and alternate office hours do to her scheduling conflicts. She is computer engineering and international affairs dual degree.   Because biggest headache was getting approved for 2nd major, and that wasn\u2019t so bad considering she needed an exception for high credit count (lots of incoming DE credits\u2026 so abnormal situation).  \nI hope it gets better for you.",

            "comment": "this is SO dependent on department. I am currently about to enter my senior year, i only know it varies heavily because i did my first 2 years as a biochemistry major and then switched to psychology. Oddly enough have an advisor that is chemistry and psychology, and in all honesty she\u2019s entirely useless and if i could get her fired i would. She gave me terrible advice as a chem advisor, and as a psych advisor didn\u2019t even have the decency to email me to cancel my advising appointment when she didn\u2019t show up to it. She also told me to \u201cgo to drop-in\u201d as if I would\u2019ve waited for an appointment for 5 weeks if drop-in worked with my schedule between being a full time college student and part-time employee. The advisors across the board seem to be useless, though I largely attribute that to them being stretched way too thin with our student population. The heavy variation is professors. My chem profs were indifferent to how students did in their class. My psych profs have all been amazing, even when the course itself is painfully boring. I\u2019m also minoring in child development and those profs (in family sciences) seem to be amazing as well. \n\nBasically; yes there\u2019s little support from guidance, but ur issue w profs is not universal. counselors are dealing with an insane number of students, I doubt they can effectively help anyone. Idk why profs are either great or terrible, but i suspect its for a reason similar to why counselors suck",

            "comment": "I worked there for a number of years, and I would have to agree with you from an inside standpoint. Staff and faculty are overworked, underpaid, under -appreciated, under-supported, and leadership is either overbearing or absent. Many faculty are tenured, so they coast by doing the bare minimum because, job security \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry as a student this spills over to affect you. With many programs being cut or altered outside of the faculty or even program\u2019s control, there may currently be some restructuring of curriculum going on as well. This would definitely pull faculty and staff attention away. If you\u2019re able to, show up to the office in person. You may not be able to see anyone, but let them see a face to accompany the name on any messages leave or emails you send. Be a squeaky wheel. They will eventually address your issues. Also, more importantly, always complete the surveys they send you. Those do get read and the results mean something. Negative results DO instigate change.",

That being said I don\u2019t know anything about if the business one also has a colloquium course that you have to take but the health professions one was honestly a waste of time. Overall I wouldn\u2019t say that you will feel like you are missing out as most of the LLC dorms are still parts of normal dorms so you will still see kids other than those in the LLC. I\u2019d say at least apply.",

    "postText": "I'm currently applying to SLP graduate school and I have several out-of-state schools that have invited me to come to their campus for an in-person interview. All of these schools are hosting these interviews on days I have class, so I'm gonna have to miss some classes to continue my grad school process. Does anyone know if there's any statement from FSU if this counts as an excused absence? I know my CSD professors will be fine with it, but I'm taking a few non-major classes with mandatory attendance that I don't want to be penalized for. Has anyone navigated this before?",

I don't totally know about this grad school interviews, but I do know that the policy is as follows:\n\n\"Excused absences include documented illness, deaths in the family and other documented crises, call to active military duty or jury duty, religious holy days, and official University activities. These absences will be accommodated in a way that does not arbitrarily penalize students who have a valid written excuse.Consideration will also be given to students whose dependent children experience serious illness.\"\n\nSo it isn't really on there unless you could make the argument that it is an \"official university acitivity\" which I mean it kind of is considering that you are trying to continue your education. \n\nPersonally I would just email your teacher weeks before and say you will be gone this day and ask if they will exempt you. \n\nMy car broke down one time and I emailed my professor that I couldn't make it to class, she ignored the email, gave me a 0, and continued on like it never happened. So you know, that's about as bad as it gets, and I'm still moseying on.",

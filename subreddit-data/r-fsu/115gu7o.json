Are those chemistry classes the same that the Chemistry majors take or are they less intense version for non-STEM.  I really have a new found respect for students who take this major!\n\nThank in advance!",

I looked at the model semester plan for other schools and they don\u2019t require nearly as much science.  I\u2019m guessing or at least hoping these tougher requirements makes FSU grad more desirable in the market place",

            "comment": "I graduated 2015 with an exercise science BS.  \n\nYou take the same gen Chem and Orgo classes with the other STEMmies.  The only area I found this major gets a \u201cbreak\u201d vs bio majors as a pre med track, was that I didn\u2019t have to take useless stuff like invertebrate physiology, or calculus based physics - trig based physics was plenty hard enough!  Also you don\u2019t need foreign language credits like bio majors do.   \n\nThe upper level courses like metabolism, Biochem, ex phys and ex phys lab are all rewarding and unique.   I have never used these skills again, but it was quite fun making exercise plans and doing cardiac stress tests on your classmates.   Metab and Biochem did help me quite a bit after FSU. \n\nThe major is really tough and you will work hard.  But I also was in a fraternity and had a lot of fun while doing it.   I ended up getting the grades and scores I needed and went to med school in New York.   You can have it all!  \n\nif you end up pursuing this, feel free to PM me with any questions.  I\u2019m an old fuck now, but some of the profs and subjects might be the same.   I REALLY STRONGLY suggest doing research on professors before you sign up for a class with multiple options.  Best of luck!",

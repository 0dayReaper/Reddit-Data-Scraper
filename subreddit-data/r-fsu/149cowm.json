    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nSo I have been accepted into FIU (Honors program), FSU, and UM as a transfer student for next fall. Honestly, I have no idea which one to choose. I live in Fort Lauderdale, an hour and a half away from UM and FIU. I would probably need to move to Miami to be closer to the schools, which is extremely expensive right now (I am not interested in student housing since I have lived with my partner for many years). FIU's pros are its flexibility and affordability, and I heard that the honors program is excellent. Also, I have a full ride. Cons for FIU are the expensive housing in Miami and I feel that it's not as \"prestigious\" as the other ones I have been accepted to. I'm not really considering UM due to the cost. Then FSU, economically and academically makes sense, Tallahassee seems to be much cheaper (from the research I've done), so I'd be saving a lot of money. FSU is one of the top three schools in FL so it's a better value overall. Con's is, well ... Tallahassee. Some more information is that I am a political science major, and my main goal is to go to law school. Which one would you guys choose?",

Personally, as a Miami kid, I\u2019m glad I came here vs. Miami because the busy nature of Miami would 100% be a distraction to my studies. IMHO, there is zero reason to choose FIU over FSU.",

If something like law school then look at FSU 3+3 program. \nTally is a different universe from Miami.  It\u2019s a good place to study because it doesn\u2019t have so many distractions and it is no doubt cheaper than Miami for cost of living.  The change can be good.\nAs a parent of a student earning International affairs degree, the admin and profs have been outstanding in terms of accessibility (office hours) career guidance etc.  These kinds of relationships are important for letters of recommend for grad/law school.  Research is heavily encouraged in all programs and this opportunity also plays into future plans.   \nIt is definitely a good value proposition, it\u2019s just can you adapt to Tally for a few years.  Daughter loves it by the way.",

    "postText": "So my parents bought an electric scooter for me and it's not meant to be stored outside in the heat and possible rain so we were hoping to store it in my dorm. It's light enough to carry it and I can hold off on charging it if need be. But I wanted to see what other people have done because we asked someone at orientation and they said we most likely would not be allowed but just wanted to get others' experience.",

But as long as you are chill and not being crazy with it. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine.\n\nPlus if someone randomly does ask you can just say oh I forgot the lock in my room and didn\u2019t want it to get stolen while I grabbed it or it died and I just had to go grab the charger so I brought it with me.",

As per the people claiming the rules of the dorms\u2026 real rules as someone who lived in the dorms: don\u2019t be obnoxious, be respectful of other people\u2019s space, be clean. For Room checks: they literally walk in look around for 30 seconds and leave. They never touched any of our stuff or opened anything. I had candles and my roomie had an air fryer we just hid them away. They also give you notice for room checks and bathroom cleaning",

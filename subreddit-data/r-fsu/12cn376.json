    "postText": " Hello everyone,\n\nI was recently accepted into Florida State University's physics PhD program and I'm excited to start my journey here. However, I'm also a bit nervous about what's ahead of me. I wanted to ask current students in the program for their thoughts on the University, and any advice they might have for an incoming physics grad student.  For context, I completed my BS in physics at the University of Florida. \n\nSpecifically, I'm curious about how difficult the graduate courses are. Are there any classes, in particular, you found difficult? The qualifying exam also sounds pretty scary seeing how it is such a comprehensive exam. Does anyone have advice on how to best prepare for the qualifying exams? I was also curious to hear what the community of grad students in the department is like. Is everyone mostly friendly? I'm also interested in any other tips or advice you might have for someone starting out in the program.\n\nIf you're a current physics grad student at FSU, I would greatly appreciate hearing your thoughts and   \n insights. Thank you in advance for your help! Sorry for the long post.",

            "comment": "It's really hard to explain what Ph.D. coursework is really like.  Normally it's to prepare you for an academic or a research career.  So you'll find that a lot of emphasis will be on building your quant skills (lots of stats classes) and doctoral seminars in major-related classes.\n\nComps are challenging.  I don't wish to revisit that ever.  When I meet people with 2 Ph.D.s I find myself thinking WHAT/WHY!?!?!?!\n\nIn the hard sciences, your advisor is going to matter a lot as you will receive much of your training in a lab setting.  Getting on papers, building a research stream and network, will be part of that mentoring process.  A good advisor can make or break your budding career.\n\nJust don't expect it to be an \"extension\" of undergrad or master's level and you'll be ok.  If you're smart enough to get into a program, you should be able to finish it if you buy-in, and expect to be a fairly changed person at the end.",

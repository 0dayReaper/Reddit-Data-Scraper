    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nMy sister is a junior in high school, and her first choice for college if she stays in-state is FSU. I graduated from FSU in 2016, and did well. Just how much does this boost her odds? Does my performance at FSU add an extra boost or just the fact that I\u2019m an alumni? Also would it be beneficial for me to join the alumni club - I saw there were potential scholarships for her if I joined, but not sure if it would help in any other way.",

    "postText": "Title pretty much says it all. I\u2019m a finance and entrepreneurship major going into my sophomore year but I am a junior by credit hours. I\u2019ve had 4-5 profs from the college of  business now, and all but 1 have been pretty bad, to the point where I was either not able to understand anything they are saying/taught or to the point where they clearly just don\u2019t care about their students. \n\nDoes it get any better? So far it\u2019s only been intro classes so it\u2019s been easy enough to teach myself but I\u2019m worried that his theme may continue into upper division courses as well. Is that the case? Any feedback is much appreciated!",

As a business grad student at a different school I\u2019ve had guest lectures from Harvard and Northwestern business school professors and they weren\u2019t a whole lot better than my FSU business professors.\n\nThe field of business at an academic PhD level is way less rigorous than other fields, and it\u2019s reflected in both teaching and research quality of the professors. \n\nIt\u2019s also VERY difficult to get quality business faculty because they can make so much more in the private sector. Think about it, a top-tier finance professor can either teach for 200k or work in private equity for 700k. It\u2019s extremely difficult to get them to teach at all, and then the best remaining ones want to teach somewhere prestigious like an Ivy League school not a state school.",

Most of us, especially in the sciences, are hired for our research ideas, publication records, and our potential to obtain grant dollars. Consequently, undergrad students are taught by experts and some of the most prominent researchers in their respective fields (which is also tied up into the ranking and prestige of the university). But, most of us have no formal training in education and often we have very little time or strong incentive to go above and beyond on the teaching front. Rarely is there any ill intent behind the quality of a instructors teaching but instead a complex cost-benefit analysis by the university and professors in terms of hiring and time allocation.",

ChemE is hard enough as is, don\u2019t do biochem on top of it. also, most of the ChemE course are coreqs with eachother, meaning its pretty difficult to take other courses on top of them. Also, BME has a lot more overlap with med school prereqs. Best of luck",

The engineering major alone is 128 credits, 8 credits higher than a normal bachelors degree in any other subject.\n\nAlso, why would you ever do this? That\u2019s the most painful college experience I can possibly imagine trying to do both of those majors simultaneously. You would be taking 4-6 hard STEM classes every single semester with practically no payoff for it. \n\nGetting a masters in biochemistry after the chemical engineering degree would make vastly more sense.",

For me, I started Florida state with a junior status (IB and AP courses) which may have played a factor in this. At the time I was one semester short of finishing biochem when I filled out some paperwork for a double major and was allowed to continue. Things may have changed so you may have to speak to someone.",

Engineering classes are infamous for obliterating your GPA.

My daughter is currently an Computer engineering and international affairs student at FSU.  It was all kinds of grief to get that approved and she showed up as a freshman with 114 credits including all engineering pre reqs and only needed 27 credits for IA (a lot of DE) .  Still needed special permission from both department chairs RVEN though the total post high school credits will be less than 90 for both degrees.  She had the GPA in IA for med school but not engineering.\nYour thought about chem d being employable if you don\u2019t get it is an excellent bit of forethought.  If you can pull the 3.75 in chemE just do that and take required bio stuff for MCAT.  Med schools don\u2019t care what degree only what about their pre reqs .  For example I have a cousin who is a doctor .. he got into med school on a BA in German .  He had a 4.0 and good MCAT score .  \nMed school will be hard don\u2019t kill your self getting there.  BTW chemE isn\u2019t considered the easy engineering either it\u2019s right up there with EE in difficulty (as an EE I always thought chemE looks much worse but they\u2019d say the same about what I was doing) food for thought.    Biomedical is a really limited field , low probability of gpa for med school lie probability for job.",

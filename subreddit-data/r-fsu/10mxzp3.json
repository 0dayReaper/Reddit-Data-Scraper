I had a mixed and diverse set of friends while attending and now as an employee. As a Gen X, big, bearded, prior military sailor, I think a lot of folks are pleasantly surprised to hear I'm very socially liberal, I'm assuming for the better from their point of view. If you don't feel comfortable in a sorority when you interview, you'll have no problem finding a crowd to vibe with if you're outgoing and personable to folks in class and around campus. There are over 700 clubs on campus. If you're interested in furthering STEM for women, check out the handful of College of Communication and Information clubs and volunteer to be an officer. They fall under an umbrella organization funded by CCI instead of the regular RSO. Other colleges will probably have this as well. Everyone can fit in at FSU, no matter their background. Ignore those that say otherwise, they're the minority.",

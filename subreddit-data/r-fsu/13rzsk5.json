    "postText": "So I\u2019m in a dilemma selecting a school, I\u2019m between FSU and FIU. Both are great schools and I don\u2019t know which way to go. FSU is one of my dream schools but it is extremely far from my home and scared if it won\u2019t be as good as I hope, FIU is way closer to home but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s meant for me to go there. Some people around me say I\u2019m crazy for wanting to go to FSU since it\u2019s so far and getting the same education I would be receiving at FIU. I plan on going to FIU for their PA Program which would be my masters but I don\u2019t know if I should for bachelors. I am a transfer student so I would have to make up my mind soon before time is up. I\u2019m planning on studying psychology. Any advice or tips would be appreciated for selecting the right school.",

It\u2019s a growing experience but living far will give you a new sense of appreciation for family and home + you will learn a lot on how to be an individual. Small college town feel is something you can\u2019t replicate in south Florida and I honestly love it. If you don\u2019t know many people coming here get involved with student government or clubs and you\u2019ll start meeting people left and right. FIU is a good choice but I\u2019d predict that a degree from fsu will be slightly more impactful in the future.",

Life is wonderful and life sucks, it truly can be what you make of it.  Make the right decision for you, not someone else, it\u2019s your life, your choice, believe in yourself.  \n\nSet realistic expectations of any place, situation, person, and so forth.  Less disappointment but if it goes for the better all the more elation.  \n\nGood luck.",

I transferred from California to FSU and got a degree and psychology and I don\u2019t regret it one bit. I\u2019m doing a postbacc here now but I was able to get some great DIS research experience here. Follow your heart.",

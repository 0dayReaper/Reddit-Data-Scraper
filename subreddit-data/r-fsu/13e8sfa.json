    "postText": "I got some AP credits in high school and sent the information to my community college. My community college translated the AP scores into college classes for me (For example, AP Bio turned into BSCXXXX course). If I apply to FSU, do I need to send them my AP credits too? Or will they just recognize that my CC accepted them as classes?",

If you didn\u2019t get your associate\u2019s, they\u2019d ask for a transcript of your AP exam. 4+ accepted, 3 rejected.\n\nI got my associates in NY and went to FSU my last 2 years.",

And from what it seems there are way too many out of control ones.      \n\nI myself have encountered very few nice frat guys. I know a number of people who don't like them for the same reason. I've heard frat pledges bragging about threatening to beat up other guys, in my dorm one of them let his roommates beat him bloody because apparently his frat hazes. There is a very prominent toxic culture buried in Greek Life and it's exploded to the surface.      \n\nSororities aren't all innocent either. They definitely behave themselves and have high standards, but some go extreme and treat other women like shit (sounds familiar?), and won't let girls in if they don't have the latest designer purses.         \n\nSomething's gotta change, because these institutions used to be better. We had presidents coming out of fraternities! And now they're known for drunken antics, sexual assault, elitism, and wildly inappropriate parties. They need to improve not just for everyone else, but for themselves. Because they're gonna fucking die out if they don't. I had plans to join Greek life, but after seeing how ugly it is, especially on the frat sides (I am not getting beaten up or killed just to live in a big house), I won't do it until they change.\n",

Third pledge death of 2017, this cannot keep happening. I have no issue with partying, most of us drink and yes, most of us drink to get drunk and have fun. But drinking to the point where you risk death is irresponsible and frats should be taking action against it. The fact that this was a pledge doesn't help.       \n\nShould the sororities have been hit? I don't know. But should the frats have been hit? Absolutely. They need to wise up, again we can't keep having people die like this. If they don't straighten up universities will just put the foot down permanently and end greek life forever. There are good frats and sororities, but come on... people are dying. The bad ones need a permanent kick off campus and the good ones need to push the idea of safe drinking.     \n",

(WCTV) -- Florida State University president John Thrasher has announced the indefinite suspension of all fraternities and sororities at the school in the wake of a fraternity member's death.\n\nThrasher made the announcement during a press conference on Monday afternoon.\n\n20-year-old Andrew Coffey, a pi Kappa Phi pledge, died Friday at an off-campus residence hall. FSU said in a press release that Coffey was found unresponsive after attending a party.\n\nFSU also announced that a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, 20-year-old Garrett John Marcy, was charged in an unrelated case with the sale and trafficking of cocaine.\n\nWhile Coffey's death remains under investigation, President Thrasher says the suspension, effective immediately, is needed to review and reflect on the loss of a young life.\n\nThrasher said in a statement, \"For this suspension to end, there will need to be a new normal for Greek Life at the university. There must be a new culture, and our students must be full participants in creating it.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.\"\n\n[Source - WCTV](http://www.wctv.tv/content/news/FSU-announces-indefinite-suspension-of-fraternities-sororities-455631773.html)",

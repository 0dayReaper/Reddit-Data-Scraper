I work 8-5 (or later) across town; is it worth applying? Do they have a lot of night classes available usually, or is it limited and they fill so fast you risk missing a semester?",

I\u2019m pretty interested in the IMC program as an option since I used to intern at the Center for Hispanic Marketing Communication in undergrad. I would have to take classes pretty late though, I\u2019m guessing around 6 or 7pm",

All my classes were either 6:00-8:00 pm or 8:00-10:00 pm. \n\nYou do the entire program online; I did, even though I live in Tallahassee and work on campus. I think maybe you\u2019re probably seeing what\u2019s left after current grad students have picked classes, if you\u2019re seeing face-to-face classes at the 5000 level. \n\nIt\u2019s a very accommodating to those who have traditional work hours. The summer classes will be mostly core classes for the programs, with some few electives tossed in.",

Sometimes though, a class is only offered every third semester as the professor may teach 3 classes in a series, one each semester as they may teach other classes or undergrad.",

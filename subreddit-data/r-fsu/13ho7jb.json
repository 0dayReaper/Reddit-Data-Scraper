There's typically only two types of people who post on sites like that - those who really just hate a professor or those obsessed with them who try to counteract the negative reviews.\n\nThe best place to look is actually the public release version of course evaluations: https://fsu.evaluationkit.com/Report/Public",

The course Evals are usually more consistent with an average students experience, though i've noticed a more positive skew on them. Professors I've thought were terrible and have heard horrible things about have 4+ averages on them with only 1-2 low scores. \n\nIMO there is a non-insignificant amount of people who go through clicking 'Strongly Agree' on every question, this Spring I took Juvenile Justice with Zane which ended up being a nightmare for most people in the course, but his Course Evals are skewed significantly towards all \"Strongly Agree\" (51% response rate)\n\nOverall I would look at all the resources, but the most important is reading the syllabus once your professor releases it, there's no way to know how the course will be until you read that.",

Most of the course resources for these are designed by teaching professors and then given to grad students. I wouldn't worry too much about this decision, if I were you.",

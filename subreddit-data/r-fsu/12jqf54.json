They just couldn\u2019t do anything about it because he had tenure.\n\nBetween him and the multiple professors known for sexual assault against students that were removed recently, it\u2019s good to see the university is finally removing the problematic faculty it\u2019s been stuck with for quite a while.",

Tenure just means they can't fire you without cause or because they don't like what you're teaching/researching. Fraud is not protected by tenure.\n\nTo my mind the bigger issues here are the dual points of 1) possible issues with the investigation / inquiry (until I know more than the few lines that were thrown out in that article, I'll withhold judgment too much judgement) and 2) examining what motivated falsifying the data. In the latter case I like to be optimistic and say it wasn't as most heavily alluded to in that other sub and that he was trying to push an ideology so much as I wonder how much of it is based on the type of pressure to produce research that he was put in by the institution, the college, outside pressures, whatever. But that's also because I'm probably jaded in general about how FSU treats its employees, faculty or staff.",

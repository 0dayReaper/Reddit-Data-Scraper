I\u2019m still waiting to hear back from a few other programs but I\u2019m 99% sure I\u2019m going to pick FSU, the college of music is top-tier. When I was there for my interview I saw a bit of railroad square at night and it seemed fun.",

Tons of nature to explore- Tom Brown park has a free 18 hole disc golf course that is really well loved and is great. We have tons of different shops and stores and coffee shops that I\u2019m sure will fit your fancy. In terms of FSU\u2019s campus. There are plenty of great places to study- I always liked Strozier, but it depends on your atmosphere that you prefer. The parking situation on campus is really poor and living nearby campus means you will be living near some high crime areas. Just be smart about where you go and at what time. I\u2019d say that it is most important to just do some exploring when you first get to campus. Find what/where you like and get involved. There are tons of clubs and events to partake in. You\u2019ll enjoy your time if you make it unique to yourself and take advantage of all that FSU has to offer. Go noles!",

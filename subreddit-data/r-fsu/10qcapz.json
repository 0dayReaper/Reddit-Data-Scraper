    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI\u2019m currently a student pursuing a double major in International Affairs and Finance.\n\nSo long story short is that I really want to do the London Internship abroad.\n\nHowever, I came in as a transfer student and I\u2019m currently at the end of my junior year.\n\nMy advisor keeps saying that people who come in with an AA degree only have two years to graduate. Similar to how people who come directly from high school only have four years.\n\nSo, if I do the London internship, I will only received 6 credits for it, and I am not allowed to take any online classes while pursuing the internship.\n\nAnd not to mention that I would like to do the internship in the Spring of 2024, which will technically be the spring of my senior year.\n\nWill I be penalized if I have to take an extra semester or two in order to graduate?\n\nThe way they\u2019re pushing for me to graduate in 2 years makes it seem like I\u2019m going to be dropped or kicked out of the school if I don\u2019t graduate on time.\n\nI hear about people taking an extra year in order to graduate all the time, in other universities that is.\n\nSo, if doing this semester abroad delays my graduation, will I not get approved for it?\n\nAnd will I face any penalties if I graduate a year later than expected?\n\nOr is that graduation rule not set in stone and it\u2019s only said in order to motivate students not to delay?",

            "comment": "There's no deadline to graduate as far as the University is concerned. You could take one class at a time from now until you graduate and no one would stop you (your advisor may ask why, but they know students have different needs). FSU wants you to graduate in 2 years as an AA transfer because it affects metrics and rankings, and secondarily to save you money on remaining in school/out of the workforce longer than necessary, but no one's gonna kick you out. \n\nI was a part-time student (6-9 credit hours per semester) through my entire undergrad. 1-2 extra semesters is TOTALLY normal, and certainly understandable if you're using that time to pursue an academic or professional opportunity. \n\nWith that said - International Programs (the study abroad office) may look at delays to graduation timeline as a factor when reviewing your study abroad application. \n\nIf you aren't able to do a study abroad program, I'd encourage you to talk to your program's career liaison about how to get plugged into international internships or career opportunities.",

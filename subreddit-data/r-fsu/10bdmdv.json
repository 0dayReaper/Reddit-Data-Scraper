    "postText": "Hey guys, so I was thinking of possibly starting and FSU Buy, Sell, and Trade subreddit. Sometimes I find myself in a position where I have something to sell, but I don't necessarily know anyone personally that would buy it. I'd rather not go on Craigslist (especially in Tally), and I don't really want to deal with Ebay either. I figured if we had a subreddit where people could coordinate meetups (preferably on campus), it would provide students opportunities to buy or sell things they need, and meet with other students in a reasonably safe and public place. I don't know if this would be useful for anyone else though...thoughts on whether or not I should set up the subreddit?",

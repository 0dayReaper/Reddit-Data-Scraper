I\u2019d just suggest working ahead in the textbook since his lectures are 1:1 from it and def take advantage of his practice material, they look exactly like his exams\n\nI did not have him for orgo 2 but I just finished orgo 2 this semester and it honestly was much easier to understand than orgo 1. After you finish proton NMR the rest of the semester is just reactions and they build off of eachother a lot, as long as you\u2019re practicing with book problems + whatever your prof provides you\u2019ll be ok!",

I heard bad things about Kearley, but from what my lab partners said I would still pick Kearley over Hilinski because they seemed to grasp the concepts better. Also the class just seemed more doable, it sounded like the only issue was that Kearley assigned a decent amount of HW but I don't think Hilinski was any better about that. Like everyone is saying, orgo 2 is usually easier than orgo 1 unless you get a bad professor",

Since I am going to live in a dorm I was wondering what the parking is like and if anyone had any tips for parking as a student living in a dorm. Thank you.",

Well, in general, if you\u2019re close to the stadium in any of the freshy dorms, you\u2019ll likely be parking in Pensacola garage as it allows overnight parking on every floor (as opposed to only top floor overnight parking which some garages unfortunately have). You should expect to never be able to park at your dorm as most spots are handicapped or are temporary unloading zones. If your dorm is close to the gym, you can park in one of the two circus lots attached directly to the big circus tent. I lived in wildwood my freshman year so those two saved me a lot. HOWEVER, on game days, be prepared to move your car if you parking anywhere near the stadium and make sure you do so a day in advance because day of is simply not an option. You have to move your car to the distant edges of campus so being quick to act will save you a parking ticket or a tow. Aside from overnight options, most of the garages during school hours are a revolving door so you should have too much difficulty finding a temp spot. Don\u2019t mess around and think that you can overnight park in a temp spot, the parking monitors WILL catch you and will slap you with a $30 fine. They\u2019re only lenient on game days/weekends as they know parking is more challenging. Idk if that helps but feel free to ask me anything, I\u2019ve been parking on campus for 2+ years now",

I will say, it\u2019s kind of shit when you are trying to park late night, because many places only have top floor parking.

Usually it\u2019s pretty open on weekends and also they don\u2019t really care where you park on weekends. Gameday you can only park in call street,Saint Augustine, and traditions (all floors). The ones closest to the stadium are all closed and you WILL be towed, a roommate I had almost got his car auctioned off because he didn\u2019t know it got towed until a week and a half later. I will say this, if you don\u2019t mind walking, or are close to McCollum, park in that lot. It\u2019s pretty safe, I\u2019ve walked across campus by myself a lot living there, and it\u2019s always empty from 4/5 pm onwards. Also, you can park there on gameday without having to go into a  garage, just don\u2019t plan on leaving, cause it will fill up on gameday. Good luck!!!",

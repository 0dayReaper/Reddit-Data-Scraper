    "postText": "I just got finished with the orientation for incoming freshman and my meeting with the academic advisors left me with more unanswered questions than answers. For scheduling classes, even though it is only June 9th and I know that at least 2/3rds of students haven't even scheduled or registered for any classes, it only seems like there are 2 or 3 options for any kind of class. I can't find any place for one of my prereqs because the class is already full. Should I wait for another teacher to open up? The engage 100 that I wanted to seems filled even though FSU totes it as being open to all. Will I get another chance to register for that? I see classes that say \"Special Topics: Honors\", which is obviously for honors kids, but can I still sign up for them, since they are at much better times?",

Or rearranging my schedule to get a class that was only offered during one of my other classes. Sometimes you have to just wait for the next semester to take the class you need. You have 4 years (probably).",

            "comment": "The university slowly opens up new class sections as more students register.  It is normal to only see a few open at a time.  As they fill up they will open more up.  They do this to make sure that they don\u2019t have a whole bunch of class sections that nobody is enrolled in.  You can change your class sections later on if you want different times.  As incoming Freshman it is going to be hard to avoid classes that are at times you don\u2019t like such as 8am or 9am.  When you register for next semester you can try to avoid the early classes, as those are usually the most unpopular class times.",

I want MAC 1140 but there's only one option on the enabled part of choosing sections and that's only for engineering LLC and the rest of the section say they're disabled because the class is full and has 0 seats. I don't know if they're waiting to open more or what.\n\nEdit: just checked again and there are some with seats open but it says it is disabled because the course is locked. I don't know what that means.",

    "postText": "Have a dual degree in Finance and Business Management. I have a professor in a finance elective that is making my life hell right now with 90% of the class ungraded and not being clear on how over 70% of that 90% is going to be split up between participation &amp; attendance (I have perfect attendance but not the best attendance cause it\u2019s a big class and a lot of my thoughts that I want to say get said before I can speak most of the time). \n\nIf I satisfy all of my business management requirements, but fail that finance elective, could I still graduate with business management? I just don\u2019t care if my job is ok with me just getting one degree, but is that possible with just passing only one?",

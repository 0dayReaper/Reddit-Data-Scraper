    "postText": "I am submitting my follow-up videos for the presidential scholarship, but I cannot seem to refine my video to only 90 seconds. Right now my videos are over the 90 seconds, and I am just wondering if this will horribly reduce my chances of getting in. I think the content of my videos are good and meaningful, I just am struggling to cut it down enough !",

Giving them more than they asked for is not putting you on their good side. I say this as someone who's been an assistant to people making these types of decisions and I've seen excellent candidates cut over silly stuff like this because *all* of the candidates were excellent and they needed reasons to cut people.",

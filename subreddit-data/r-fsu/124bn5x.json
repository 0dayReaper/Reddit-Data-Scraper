    "postText": "Hey guys, there's a group of engineers representing FSU in a competition for the ACC. They've been going around the engineering college asking for votes and I figured I can help them out by spreading the message to Reddit. Here's a flyer they made, all we basically gotta do is text this number, or if you scan the QR code with your phone it can automatically open your messaging app and fill the text in. This is the competition they're in: https://www.accinventureprize.com/teams",

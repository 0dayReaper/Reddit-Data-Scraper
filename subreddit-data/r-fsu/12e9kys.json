    "postText": "Hi everyone so I need advice on this subject matter. \n\nI am currently in my last semester of junior year as a finance major, and it has really pushed me to my limits. I feel miserable in this major and cannot see myself going into corporate finance or IB. I have an internship in the summer lined up for consulting which will be great, but I am really have thoughts on switching into marketing. I am a creative person and have always enjoyed exploring that aspect of life. I went into finance because of its post grad opportunities and I suppose prestige(silly reason I know), since it is a difficult major. Should I switch out? I feel bad that I worked so hard in these upper level accounting and finances classes just to have them render useless, but I can\u2019t stand the thought of doing cost accounting and fin4504 next semester. I am always stressed out.\n\nI also plan to move to europe (dual citizen) and try to get a job there, so I\u2019m worried it will be harder with a marketing degree? \n\nAny advice is much appreciated, thank you in advance!",

But also just know when you graduate you can likely go into marketing with a finance degree. It\u2019s just a very over saturated job market. \n\nMaybe don\u2019t take any classes this summer and just focus on your internship then decide. Nothing is worth it if you\u2019re truly miserable. \n\nI\u2019m in engineering and have had similar thoughts with certain classes. I just keep telling myself usually senior year is easier than junior. Less brand new concepts.",

It's so great to have a quiet campus. You don't have to fight for parking. The lines for food are never long. You always have a Shady spot on Landis. The gym is one of the best parts as well. No waiting for equipment. Quiet campus is amazing.\n\nAlso, a lot of people in their junior/senior or grad school years live here full time and don't leave during the summer.",

            "comment": "I\u2019d say you need a little more specificity that people are leaving out, I stayed here all last summer and I am only speaking in regards to the number of people on campus in my further comments. The first six week section of summer is Dead, like nearly everyone is gone, I\u2019d say like &lt;5% the amount of people normally. The second set of six weeks for summer is much more like normal numbers on campus, feels like public areas are at 40-70% of where you would expect them normally. You probably only have the option to start in the second set of six weeks if you are coming from high school, but in case you are a summer transfer/something else this is important to know. Also does not mean that I don\u2019t enjoy the first six weeks of summer here.",

I like the summer semester because there are fewer people (coming from a socially anxious person). \n\nOne thing that I will note is that if you are taking summer math classes or any heavy content course, you need to be on top of your deadlines because they will catch up to you quickly! This is coming from a person who took one during the Summer 2021 term.",

Would I live on campus and take classes only during this period and then have to move all of my stuff? Or could I take classes during this period and keep my belongings on campus all summer. Asking because my parents live 11 hours away and I do not want to have to move all of my things to another room just to only live there for a month and then have to move all my belongings to Tennessee. !!",

You\u2019ll most likely have a lot of fun since most of the people in the dorms will make more of an effort to get to know each other as apposed to spring and fall. Although classes move fast you\u2019ll have a lot of time to relax and enjoy the environment.",

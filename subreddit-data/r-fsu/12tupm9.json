If thats the case for fsu I\u2019d might have to pay for a 5th year possibly without an Out-Of-State waiver which I certainly don\u2019t look forward to. I emailed them about it, hopefully thats not the case.",

The out of state waiver requires you to do 15 credits per semester which would put you on track to graduate in 4 years...(120 credits total). \nAlso please let me know what they say, it's the same exact situation for me with the scholarship and all. This is just what I understood when I first saw it.",

Your I-20 would be lengthened or shortened based on how much time you need to complete your program.\u201d\nSo I guess if I take 15 credit per semester I\u2019ll be able to complete my program in 4 years\n\nEdit: For my program i need 128 credit hours, ig i\u2019ll have to attend a summer semester as well",

If you are doing an OPT after graduation then you\u2019ll get 60 days after that finishes as stated in that same section.\n\nHope this helps!",

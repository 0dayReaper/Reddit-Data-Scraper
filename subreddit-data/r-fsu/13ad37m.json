I\u2019m an incoming freshman and was wondering if I should bring my skateboard and/or longboard to FSU as a mode of transportation.",

It can get pretty crowded tho during \u201crush hour\u201d when people are transitioning between mid-day classes. You would survive tho. Also, be aware that Tally is very hilly. Not sure how much of an issue that is for skating.",

The drawback with ebikes is if you live on campus it may be difficult to store them some place...id be hesitant to leave mine locked up. so i see a lot of students with electric scooters. seems to solve that problem. but ebikes are incredible because you can get around town anywhere within a reasonable distance. basically solves the problem of not having a car.",

The campus has a lot of hills so it's very fun but if you hit a rut going downhill, good luck.\nAnd for some reason the sidewalk between Cawthan and some buildings near left side facing it there was always a patch of sand. I learned that the hard way.",

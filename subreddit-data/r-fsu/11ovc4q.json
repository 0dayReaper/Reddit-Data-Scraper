    "postText": "I graduated in December 2020; in March 2022, I received $480. I remember I called and asked what it was for, and FSU confirmed it but couldn\u2019t tell me what it was a refund for; though I can\u2019t remember which office I called. I wasn\u2019t going to waste hours on this and would look into it later. Now I have to do my taxes, and I don\u2019t know if this income is taxable, as in overpayment from Bright Futures, or nontaxable for some other reason. Once I spend time on Monday getting my 2FA working again, I will check MyFSU, but for now I\u2019m kinda worried. I wasn\u2019t issued a 1098-T past 2020. This is frustrating because I\u2019m going to have to spend time while at work on Monday, fixing the 2FA and waiting on hold getting ping-ponged around offices, and I\u2019m not even a student anymore. Not to mention being worried about my tax return.\nHas anyone had this happen before?",

Since you were enrolled in classes in 2020, you would have qualified for some of you didn't previously receive it?",

Not often, but I've had to reach out on occasion to have things corrected in a student's file. \n\nReach out to your advisor directly to clarify if the D- grade can be used for that requirement or if you'll need to take something else. You don't want to stay quiet and then have it get caught in a graduation audit that you don't actually meet requirements to graduate.",

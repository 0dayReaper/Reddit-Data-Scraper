    "postText": "Hello, I am a new student planning to major in CS. I have not yet purchased a laptop for my classes because I don't know what operating system is required for the major. I know they prefer a Windows device for engineering, but I could not find any requirements for CS. Should I get a Mac or Windows device? Please help, thanks.",

            "comment": "There is no laptop or OS requirement. You wont have to compile and run your code on your laptop's OS because you can connect to the CS department's servers through a remote connection which works for Linux, Windows, or Mac laptops. You can also text edit your code there if you want. I usually write and run my code on VS code, but if its not a simple program and uses a lot of memory allocation I use the school's servers.",

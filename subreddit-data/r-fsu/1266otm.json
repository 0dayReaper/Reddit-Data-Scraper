Does it take at least 24 hours for the button to appear? I want to do this quickly since I feel like I'm a little behind on registration.",

Check periodically over the day if it\u2019s not already changed by the next time you check. It should be pretty soon. But don\u2019t panic about registering for orientation, you\u2019ll get it done. You\u2019ll be fine!",

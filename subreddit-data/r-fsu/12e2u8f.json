Yet, I still can\u2019t shake how much I like FSU. thoughts?",

For me that was FSU and I have never once regretted it.",

Call/email advisers at both schools and see if there are courses that transfer/don\u2019t transfer easily. In Florida, courses are defined across public campuses statewide, making transfer credits easy. Outside of the state this is less guaranteed. \n\nALSO: when/if you transfer to FSU, you can apply to their honors program as a transfer student.",

I am in Tallahassee and went to FSU, and I see some of my employees graduate with debt they can't get out from under. Get a good education where you can, but go into debt for grad-school if needed, not for your undergraduate degree.",

I did this my first year and I am so thankful I chose to do what I did. You get the experience of meeting FSU people who will be on main campus with you soon enough and still get the FSU culture vibe. It is such an underrated seminole pathway and I know a lot of people hesitate to go through with it but in my opinion it is the best one to take, especially if you are an out of state student, because after your first year abroad you receive in state tuition.",

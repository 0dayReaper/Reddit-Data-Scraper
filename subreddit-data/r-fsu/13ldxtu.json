Take CGS2518 with Ken Armstrong if you are a business major since it is required of everyone and is not a difficult class by any means (it\u2019s just time consuming). \n\nIf you are NOT a business major, and are only doing this for a credit that\u2019s needed to graduate FSU, then take CGS2100 with Adria Peaderson (idk if i spelled her last name correct but it\u2019s along those lines). \n\n\nI highly recommend CGS2518 bc I found it to be an easy A and it allowed me to get EXCEL certified which is something employers universally want to see. But, you do what\u2019s best for you!",

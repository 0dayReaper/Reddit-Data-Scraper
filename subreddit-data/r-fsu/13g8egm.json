            "comment": "Incoming freshmen register at Orientation, and unless things have changed in the last few years, you cannot do it UNTIL Orientation (there's a hold preventing people from doing it at home). Additionally, a large block of seats and classes are reserved for those freshmen, so it's not like a Sophomore or Junior is going to take your spot in a class (in most cases).\n\nGenerally, I tell people going to TCC first is not bad, and is actually a great opportunity to save some money and be eased into the expectations of college classes. That said, many friendships (lasting friendships) are made between FTIC freshmen within the residence halls, dining halls, campus events, and general ed classes. If you have the opportunity to come in fall, I absolutely recommend doing so in this case.",

If that \u201cenrollment\u201d aka yield number is lower than anticipated a university has \u201cincreased space\u201d to offer students from waitlists or alternate pathways.

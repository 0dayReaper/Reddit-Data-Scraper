I know the most likely response is going to be either drop CDA or drop COP. Is one better to take before the other? Thanks for any help.",

            "comment": "A lot of people would be inclined to tell you that that schedule is a terrible idea. They very well may be right. I will say my COP4530 class was one of my least time intensive class I took last semester (took it with Mallory), but CDA3100 takes a lot of time if you want an A, especially when it comes to projects, and MAC2312 kicked my ass when I took it, and in ~150 credits of college classes is the only class I ever failed. Its a doable schedule, but those 3 classes have the reputation they do for a reason. If you had any wiggle room on any of those I would try and find a way to push one of them back to the spring/summer. \n\nPersonally, I would push back MAC2312 until you can take it over the summer, then do so at a community college. I would replace it with either Myers Java class or one of the intro level cyber security classes, or *maybe* discrete 1/2 if you havent finished both yet. There isnt any real benefit to taking CDA3100 before COP4530 except that the classes have a similar workflow (lot of learning, little regular work, then out of the blue giant assignment) but there really isnt any content overlap. If you had to choose one out of those 2 I would choose 4530 just because it unlocks more and more interesting electives.\n\nAlso assuming you are a CS major and not a Programming + Applications major CGS classes dont count for electives, so if you are just trying to hit 15+ I would definitely look into some of the LIS classes, they have a rather significant overlap with CS topics, but thats only if you dont mind not getting credits that count toward the major.",

I\u2019ll definitely try and take Myers\u2019 Java class, thank you for the advice.",

But CDA3100 and MAC2312 are two classes that are fairly difficult and require alot of time to just sit down, study the concepts within them and tackle the assignments that come with. \n\nAlso, I don't know who told you you'd need to have CDA3100 to understand 4530. That's not true. An argument could be made for 3100 needed for 4531 due to the efficiency and complexity of your programs taking a front seat. But, I'd highly recommend getting it pushed back to another semester.",

Honestly, I think you guys will eventually rebel when you realize that you were sold the bill of goods that you need to grow up to soon.  Nothing made me laugh more than college advisors telling my 16 year old daughter she needed to pick a major because she had enough credits for her AA already.  I told her she didn't and that now was the time to try as much as you wanted and if you tried and failed so what.  She didn't fail, ever, but she also actually applied to college as \"undetermined\" despite the more than 100 credits.  Maturity helps decision making, not number of courses completed.",

Think dental hygiene, physical therapy assistant, occupational therapy assistant, etc. \n\nAS may allow you to transfer, I actually am not 100% on it.

DE  has exploded in the last 10 years so now you have more than a few kids coming out of high school with AA. Unfortunately many don\u2019t know that they need to do the pre reqs for major to use this and their AA is the 36 gen Ed\u2019s and fun electives that they thought would be easy GPA boost.  FSU has the GPS OFFICE. Specifically for DE AA freshman and they say most only have gen eds unfortunately.",

Your GPA and pre reqs are considered for admission to college at the university.  My understanding is a 3.5 will get you into UF, 3.0 FSU etc. \n\nPro tip for kids in Florida.  If you do Dual enrollment and graduate high school with your AA you have two paths to admission.  Freshman admit and if rejected you can immediately apply as a transfer student.  I've known several kids who used the transfer after being denied to either UF or FSU.",

Not all schools calculate weighted GPA the same so it's meaningless.\n\nClass rank is more interesting than GPA. Also, the average number of honors and AP classes is more telling than the incoming average weighted GPA.\n\n\"Applications\" can also be misleading. I'm not sure how FSU does its count, but some schools count even incomplete applications like when someone never submits their transcripts.",

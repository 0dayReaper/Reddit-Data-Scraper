Once you get to PhD level you\u2019re qualified for the more technical positions that come with higher pay. A political science masters doesn\u2019t get deep enough into the nitty gritty technical skills to add much value.\n\nA more specialized masters in the area you\u2019d like to work in would serve you better. Urban planning, demography, public health, public administration etc. which directly lead into jobs in both the industry itself and the policy side of the topic.",

    "postText": "I am from Miami and got accepted into both FlU and FSU. I am conflicted as to which college to attend. I have 100% Bright Futures but I am not sure if I should move out of my house to live in Tallahassee, or stay at home and live with my parents while studying at FIU. Neither college is paying me to attend the school, so if I move to Tallahassee, I would have to be both studying and working part time in order to pay for an apartment/living. If I stay, I would not have to pay any bills other than personal expenses. I plan on studying Management Information Systems, which FSU has a higher ranking than FIU. I also would like to experience what it\u2019s like to live outside of Miami.",

            "comment": "Definitely FSU. It will teach you independence which something that staying at home and going to FIU will not teach you. I'm from Miami, got 100% bright futures and decided to go to FSU. I learned to be independent and I also realized that FSU accepts more college credits than FIU does (I did IB thats why). If you worry about ranking, I would still choose FSU.",

It will teach you independence and your social life will blossom relative to living at home. It's very hard to have friends over and to date when you live at home",

            "comment": "i was in the exact same situation as you were, the only difference is i\u2019m a public health major rather than management information systems. i decided on fsu and it has by far been the best decision i\u2019ve made. you\u2019ll get so much more out of being in tallahassee, especially learning to live on your own and not rely on your family nearly as much as you would if you pick fiu. my brother goes to fiu and regrets his decision, saying things about how he wishes he didn\u2019t have to live at home and could\u2019ve gotten so much more out of his college experience if he went elsewhere. another perk for fsu is it has a much richer student life than at fiu. even if you don\u2019t club or party (which i rarely do) there are so many student organizations where you can find where you fit and make great friends. from a work perspective there are options all around campus and nearby, i work to pay for my housing and it makes me appreciate what i have so much more. tallahassee is also a lot more relaxed than miami in my opinion, it isn\u2019t nearly as loud but there aren\u2019t as many hispanic food options which i\u2019m used to, but there are a few gems around the city that i love. id 100% pick fsu if i had to decide again.",

Call the undergraduate studies office if you have any questions since theyre the dean's office for incoming students and the office that actually cares the most about summer students being in person. They try to get departments to offer more in person seats in classes so that students who are here can actually be in a classroom but it's not like they'll kick you out of school if you're taking online classes since they really can't prove you aren't here if you don't have classes to attend in person.\n\nhttps://undergrad.fsu.edu/departments/office-undergraduate-studies",

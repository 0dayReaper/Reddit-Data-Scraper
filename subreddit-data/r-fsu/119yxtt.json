In short a Systems Engineer oversees the life cycle of a specific project. FSU offers it as a masters degree fully remote. I received my undergrad in Electrical Engineering and a lot of my coworkers followed the path of EE/CE to SE. \n\nI was just curious if anyone had any personal thoughts on the program that have been through it. Like workload, professors they liked or disliked, or helpful resources they used.",

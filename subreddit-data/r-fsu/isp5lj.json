I'm asking you today to please share this post on any subreddit you can think of that may be able to help this out:\n\nIf schools are **refusing** to find a secure, safe way to proctor our exams, we need to force them to find a better method. Not by finding ways **Honorlock breaches our privacy, we already know** those. There have been posts of people sharing that sort of information. Instead of complaining to the universities, let's ***report the*** [Google Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/honorlock/hnbmpkmhjackfpkpcbapafmpepgmmddc). If enough of us report it, Google will have to **take it down** and our schools will find a better solution. Consider the **14.3k people here**, and if we share this post, the **possibly 100k** people reporting it. If Google receives thousands upon thousands of reports about Honorlock being a violation of user privacy, **maybe we can get rid of it** once and for all.",

Why assume that the backbone of our argument against Honorlock is that we plan to cheat? Thanks to covid, our education is currently already being screwed over due to everything being remote. You think we just don't care about learning? I'm sorry that I am concerned about my privacy in my own home. How dare us students voice an opinion",

And now cheating is easier.\n\nI personally prefer making tests that can be open-note or (like the previous poster said) set the time limit so that they don't have time to look up everything. But if I didn't, I would have to make the assumption that some students would try to cheat (as it is, I assume some will try to work together and write my tests accordingly). Because some always do.",

I have all the privacy options on Google turned on, and use DuckDuckGo occasionally for searching if I'm particularly concerned. I don't give Twitter any identifying information. Even if I did, that's not an excuse for Honorlock to do so. Just because that's how it's done, doesn't mean it's moral.\n\nOnce again, my concern isn't that the company is selling my data. My concern is that they are completely opaque about how that data is transmitted and stored.\n\nYou sound like one of those \"nothing to hide, nothing to fear\" kinda folks, so let me just address that argument. Imagine if an uber-vegan government were elected in 20 years or so. They decide to eliminate privacy so they can send any current or former meat-eaters to concentration camps. That's an extreme example, but it makes the point pretty clear. Just because someone doesn't have anything to hide from the *current* government, doesn't mean they won't have something to hide from a future one.\n\nA more realistic example, imagine if a supremacist group breached Honorlock, either through physically copying data from a person on the inside or getting entry to their databases from the outside. They then publish as much private information on non-white students as they can get their hands on. If Honorlock can't be transparent about their security, then they can't be trusted to be secure.",

Like it's just unnecessary stress and can literally affect grades. \n\nNot to mention it's just added stress on the professors too. For example, in my organic chemistry class we had to retake the quiz TWICE because honorlock wouldn't load pictures for like more than half the class (required to answer the quiz). Also, on our second quiz it was requiring an access code and the professor had to extend the quiz duration due to it. \n\nLike, we get it that everything is online and professors want to maintain academic integrity. However, honorlock has to be the worst way to do it. It's not a question of cheating, it's a question of the professors not trusting the student body and causing more stress for everyone.\n\nAs for the security of the student bodies information. I hate the fact that we have to trust honorlock won't sell our information to any company with big enough pockets. Granted google probably has more information on me than honorlock but still. It's stupid that we have to show our IDs every single quiz/exam, that we have to show our environment, or that some random person is watching me for 30-60 minutes. It's just sketchy all around.\n\nDo I think that anything will change? No probably not. So many schools have contracts with honorlock that getting their extension banned isn't possible. I appreciate others discussing the security of the student body but I just can't see honorlock going away anytime soon.\n\nAnyway that's just my 2\u00a2.\n\n(Also for any professor that thinks honorlock will prevent cheating is just ignorant or stupid... Maybe both)",

First off, even if I was exposing my privacy and data through all those things, that would be a personal decision and I would be accepting the risks on my own. Honorlock is being unjustly forced on us, and the only way around it would be to fail all the classes using it. The university either needs to ditch these sketchy companies or create their own platform that us students can verify as being secure. There is no real reason why we couldn't use canvas for our test taking",

You and your ilk yet have nothing to substantiate your dislike of the program other than your readiness to bitch about something that forces you to adhere to the honor policy. Again, go figure out some substantive injustice that has been committed, unless the activity of pointlessly complaining on the internet is your best form of amusement.",

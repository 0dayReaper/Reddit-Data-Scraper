Like any application or anything like that? Thank you for any advice!",

But they are worth applying to tho. \n\nThe fact that is very niche to your community makes it easier for you to win it. You can reuse your essays bc the prompts are usually the same. You might think $500 is not much, but winning many of these will stack money up. And trust me: THEY ARE WORTH EVERY SINGLE EFFORT. \n\nAsk your high school counselor / college counselor to give you a list of local scholarships. They usually receive it at the beginning of the month. \n\nIf you have any questions, you can always DM me :)\n\nGood luck!!",

My sister and brother both went to college/ university, they didn\u2019t get much, but I got quite a lot and didn\u2019t expect to. You never know, and all it takes is an application that you submit for FREE. It\u2019s free money regardless, so do it.",

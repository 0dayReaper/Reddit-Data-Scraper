    "postText": "I am going to fsu as a freshman but I\u2019m confused about my major\u2026 my eventual goal was to become an attorney so I chose political science but now I\u2019m not sure. I want to either become a corporate lawyer or patent but I\u2019m not sure if science is something I can succeed in. \n\nI am also an international student so I\u2019m not sure how likely will it be for me to be employed after college because I won\u2019t be able to practice anywhere else with US law license\n\nMy other option was clinal psychology but again I\u2019m not sure for how it would work for me as an international student and to be honest I\u2019m not even sure what the pathway to become a psychologist is.\n\nMy plan was to take basic classes for the summer and fall that would be mostly required by all majors. \n\nWhat classes should I take and what should my thought process be for deciding on a major and career?",

            "comment": "I was a political science major, worked as a paralegal, and was originally pre-law. It isn\u2019t actually very helpful for law other than being easy for a high GPA. The classes are too basic and don\u2019t require much skill development.\n\nStatistically, philosophy majors do by far the best on the LSAT and in law school because they study formal logic, have writing skills just as great as English majors, and analyze arguments at a very deep level, which are skills directly applicable to every aspect of law.\n\nI\u2019d suggest a philosophy and psychology double major for your goals. It\u2019ll prepare you for both law school and a PhD in clinical psychology (which is how you become a psychologist). You can also take biology, chemistry, and neuroscience classes as electives to meet the patent bar requirements (which only requires a specific amount of credits in specific fields, not a major in science).",

But, it doesn't really make a difference for that sense there is no such thing as a true pre-law major, at least if the undergraduate level. Majors that tend to be good in terms of providing skill sets that help in law school are philosophy, English, and economics. That said, political science, international affairs, and economics are three of the largest majors at FSU by count of students who apply for and get into law school.",

I\u2019m currently in law school and I studied international relations. But I\u2019ve never heard of a firm asking applicants what they got their degree in or even deny applicants for that reason so for law school it doesn\u2019t really matter",

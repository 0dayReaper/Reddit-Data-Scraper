I spent five years in Tally, and my situation wasn\u2019t common. \n\nThere\u2019s an apartment complex called the Preserve northwest of campus that had a security guard at the front gate. I was a delivery driver and off the top of my head that\u2019s probably one of the safer seeming complex\u2019s that I delivered to. I lived in a house a couple blocks over and that area\u2019s pretty nice.",

Rarely do people target specific houses and cars. The further you live from campus the less likely you are to ever see or hear of a break in. Less population density = less criminals",

You could look up the address by police reports and see the complexes that have the least amount of police reports filed. But reporting bias could exist. But the less crazy stuff will go on at the places that have the least amount of college aged kids typically.",

I called the security office, and I was promptly told \"lol we no longer service SHS\". I called the housing office, no response on their emergency line. Ended up calling TPD. SHS called me back in the morning trying to act like  I never contacted them and blamed me for not having the new security number saved (which they didn't ever send to me). Other awful things: there was an armed assault/altercation outside my complex and security never came after my neighbors called multiple times (it eventually escalated to a standoff with police), my car got towed despite being registered and labeled properly and SHS refused to pay to get my car returned, SHS ignored every ADA accommodation I was promised despite me only signing with them because they promised accessibility, failure to fix literally anything in the apartment after multiple requests\n\nStay far, far away. There are so many less shitty companies with safer complexes in Tally.",

It\u2019s not what you want to hear but I\u2019ve lived in 3 different apartments near fsu and every single one had shootings and break ins. I live on the other side of town. Peace and safety is worth a 4 mile drive. Plus student Apartment complexes see so much crime and drama if you have an issue they won\u2019t care. I lived in Aqua Club, Polo Club, and a townhouse in Frenchtown. I woke up to a man at the foot of my bed because they didn\u2019t change the locks in the townhouse. That place and aqua club had crackheads living above me sleeping in front of my door and beating eachother half to death everyday. My friends have had similar experiences. The roommate matching is a joke. I got stuck with psychos with no empathy or common sense. I had a friend who said their random roommate hid their knives under the stairs and stabbed holes in the wall. It\u2019s not what you wanna hear and it will probably get me downvoted into oblivion but the 32304 is the poorest zip code in the state so no one cares because they\u2019re all just trying to survive.",

The immediate area around FSU is the \u2018crime circle\u2019 of tally but don\u2019t let that scare you. It\u2019s mostly petty theft from kids leaving their cars or apartments unlocked. (By all means break-ins/violent crimes do happen, and unfortunately everyone should be prepared for one, but you won\u2019t be as of risk of one if you look further out from campus, as the crime rates are lower) \n\nBe smart and keep aware and you should be ok. \n\nI also recommend looking at this link: https://www.talgov.com/gis/tops/\nIt is a crime map of tally that shows ongoing and past crime occurrences. Good luck. \n\nEdit: Looking into that specific company, they seem sketchy. I\u2019m of the opinion that you should stay farrr away from any corporate-owned \u2018student\u2019 apartment complexes because they seem to be overpriced and always in horrid areas. It\u2019s hella late, but try to find some more local places that have actual landlords, or try looking a bit farther out from campus. Unfortunately the companies running these \u2018student housing solutions\u2019 are usually shitty.",

            "comment": "Honestly if you avoid places like aquaclub (now the social seminole) where the dangerous stuff is right at your doorstep, I'd say the easiest way to feel safe is to have roommates you trust. I would NOT trust any random roommate matching. Getting people who are on the same terms with you of keeping the doors/windows locked, not letting people they barely know inside, and respecting your personal in space is completely up to chance with roommate matching (especially at places that rent to a lot of people other than students, which is more common than you may think with cheaper complexes near campus). If you find a place that's decent seeming in terms of safety, having roommates you trust will make it so much better. With that being said, if you plan on living alone, I wouldn't live near campus unless it's in a dense/well-lit area like collegetown.",

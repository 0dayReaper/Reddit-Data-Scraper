    "postText": "I\u2019m currently living in France right now as an au pair and I am hoping to live here for another year here and start my FSU studies online. From what I\u2019ve read on the website, international study is encouraged but I\u2019ve also been told by others it is a requirement, but I have no idea if that is even the case at all. I have emailed the counselor but as my application has not been processed yet I haven\u2019t heard anything back from her. \n\nDoes anybody know what the course load is like/if the classes are offered online OR if I can apply to study in person somewhere abroad/what the study abroad options are or if they\u2019re just internships?\n\nI, no offense, hated living in Tallahassee when I lived there a couple years ago (not a big fan of the clubs on Tennessee + got a job at black dog only for the owner to be insane and have to work in a roach infested cafe) so I would probably just not even bother enrolling in classes and just drop the program if there\u2019s no choice but living there again. \n\nAll advice is appreciated or if you just have an opinion on the major as a whole I\u2019d love to hear, thanks!",

You could probably get some of the courses online but would end up needing to be in Tallahassee at least for part of the degree. \n\nFSU only has 6 fully online bachelor degrees. Social Science, Computer Science BS or BA, Criminology, Public Safety, and Financial Planning.",

You'd want to reach out directly to the IA program for specific information.\n\nI don't mean this with any disrespect, I'm sincerely curious - if you don't want to physically attend FSU and you're not interested in the online degree programs that are offered, why don't you look at other schools? It seems really cumbersome to try and jigsaw together upper-level major courses from other schools to transfer here when you could just get a degree somewhere that better fits what you're looking for.",

If you're already in the College of social sciences though, just see if you can switch to their distance learning ISS major",

It doesn\u2019t really matter anymore, this happened over a year ago, I\u2019m no longer at the school, but I\u2019m just curious. How does it work, and do housing contract numbers actually mean anything? I for instance filled out my housing contract at a reasonable time after committing. Neither early nor late. I ended up getting put on a waitlist, and ultimately was told part way through summer that there were no more rooms left for me. I ended up suffering living at The Hub (now known as \u201cACASA Ocala\u201d), even experiencing gunshots directly outside of the unit I was staying in\u2026 I had totally expected getting a dorm and was totally unprepared to get an apartment, but I digress.\n\nCoincidentally, I personally knew another kid from my school who not only committed late to FSU, but also wasn\u2019t in Honors. And I am absolutely, positively, 100% sure they also completed their housing contract later than mine. Like I\u2019m talking, they didn\u2019t complete it until the very last moment in May, like near due-date. Super late. And somehow this kid ended up getting a dorm despite having no official priority over me, a higher contract number than me, and (I assume) being further back on the waitlist considering I completed my contract before him. How does something like that even happen?",

The apartment complex has 3 different clubhouses which offer countless amenities such as two gyms, free trainer classes from Top Dog, study rooms, two pools, etc. Each room comes with a private bathroom and walk in closet. My current room is one of the bigger rooms in the unit as well (picture provided if requested!) The living area is incredibly spacious, including two desk areas, a huge laundry room, a lot of cabinet space and the unit includes a balcony. I also have a RESERVED parking spot which comes with the lease. The parking spot is located right in front of the building. You will also be paying my current rate which is SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER than most prices in college town, a total of $940 with utilities, rent, garbage pickup, etc. \nhttps://www.urbanenclave.com\nFeel free to PM me or comment down below \ud83d\ude42",

We currently live in a house but one of us is gonna be moving out soon, so we need someone to hopefully take his place. \n\nIt's a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom house near the corner of Ocala and Tennessee, with an extra office room. It's in a mostly quiet neighborhood so if that's your thing definitely come take a look. We've got our own backyard with a pool too. The house itself is kinda old and it's got a few quirks to it but it's comfortable and everything (i.e. all sinks, dishwasher, dryer/washer, lights, AC, pool, toilets, fridge, stove, etc.) works well. Rent is 617 per month and includes pool and lawn care, and the leases are by the room so you're only responsible for your portion. Also, we've already got utilities set up under one of our names.\n\nAbout us, we're 2 guys, 20 and 21 years old. We're super respectful roommates and we try to get along well with the people we live with. I like living here because it's quieter than the rest of all the places surrounding campus, and my roommate and I hopefully want to keep it that way; we're serious about school, we rarely have friends over, we keep our common areas reasonably clean, and we're as quiet as we can be in the morning or at night if one of us has gone to sleep already or is studying. \n\nObviously these are more general guidelines and we're not expecting you to be a perfect saint or anything, but if you're more the type that's focused on school and not really into partying, then definitely hit me up!",

The other rooms in the apartment will most likely be locked and unoccupied for the duration of the lease.

            "comment": "Main Details: \nHey! Im looking for two female roommates for the Preserve at San Luis at $629 a month plus utilities starting in early August. One room upstairs and one room downstairs, both facing the back of the apartment. My unit is technically the unfurnished cheaper option, but Ive been living there for years so the common areas and kitchen are already fully set for the most part. I am graduating soon and would ideally like someone who\u2019s just starting their career or a phD student, but am open to anyone. \n\nPets: \nI have a large shedding dog that stays in the living room majority of the time, and a dog walker for when I work. I would not recommend living with me if you have pet allergies or any fear of dogs. If you have a dog too, I would strongly want them to meet first at the local dog park just to make sure they get along. I do have a roomba downstairs and try to mop the floors once a week. I believe the unit has a two pet limit, so only one person could bring a pet. They accept cats, dogs, and caged animals like snakes, hamsters, etc. \n\nMy Personal Preferences: \nThe only things I really care about are quiet at night so we can all sleep, give a couple day heads up if you\u2019re throwing a party, if you smoke please do it on the porch, please dont leave dishes in the sink for days at a time, and if youre in a relationship PLEASE dont have your partner there all the time. Sorry if that seems like a lot, just had a particularly bad set of roommates last time so Im trying to find people with similar lifestyles/wants and would rather be upfront. \n\nMy Flaws as a Roommate: \nMy personal flaws are Ill forget Im doing laundry half way through, but youre welcome to throw my stuff in the collapsible basket I have if you need to do your stuff. I also tend to take up a lot of room in the freezer because I mostly shop in bulk, but Im looking into a chest freezer to help with that. Finally, my dog does have separation anxiety and will whine if she sees you and you dont pet her and will bark when other dogs walk in front of the house. She also will eat trash bags if you leave them out. I try to mostly keep to myself, so I may also come across as rude by accident by being in my room a lot. I think thats the most honest review I can give of myself, hopefully that helps you know what youre signing up for. If you have any follow up questions, let me know",

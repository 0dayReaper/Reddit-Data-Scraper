    "postText": "hey yall!! so i plan on transferring for the fall 2023 semester and by the end of this semester i\u2019ll have my AA, all pre reqs for my major (psychology) and have a good gpa (around 3.5). Im taking two math classes (MAC1105 and STA2122) this semester, because theyre in progress will that affect my chances on a conditional acceptance? (assuming i get in). I know theres a requirement that atleast one math class must be taken but im not sure if that applies for now or by the time of the admitted semester.\n\nThank you!!!!",

You'd get a letter on your application stating that your file is on hold with the university to wait for your math grade. You'll need to send an updated transcript once that grade becomes available so that the hold can be lifted. Then your application would be sent to your intended major for a final decision.",

Intermediate algebra will be counted as elective hours toward your degree but will not satisfy the math requirement for admission or graduation, so you'd still receive a hold for your current semester grades. \n\nAnd it sounds to me like you're in good shape academically, but your best bet would be to call admissions and request to speak to a transfer counselor to discuss the likelihood of admission. They'll be able to see all your info that you've submitted and give you a better idea if anything sticks out as a red flag.",

There are several apartments owned by Phoenix South in this area that are all relatively close to the school, but Jefferson Towers is a 3-minute walk to the Westcott Gate. Noise is a factor (mostly on weekends) due to close proximity to Potbelly's, several sorority houses, etc. I find the tradeoff to be well worth it for the great location and reasonable rent. The office staff is friendly, helpful, and prompt. Maintenance are a great group of guys who get work orders done quickly and efficiently.\n\nUnits go quickly, so I'd contact the office right away to set up an appointment and ask any questions. You can ask them to show you a vacant unit when you go in to talk to them about renting a place.",

Got an A-\nIt\u2019s possible but we started off with 12 students (majors only section) and after the first exam? It went down to 8, by the time the final exam came we had 3 students (including me) that had a fighting chance in passing this class and 2 students that took it with already registering the course again for the summer. \nSafe to say\u2026do not take him.",

I can\u2019t believe I actually forgot her name but it\u2019s probably because after a few weeks the class just called her satan. Ended up having to drop it and it was 4 credit hours so this was a very difficult decision costing like 800-900$. It really was insane we had to memorize dozens of different frog calls and identify them within 10 seconds before they moved on to the next call. We had to go all over to random streams and catch whatever herps we could but I actually loved that part. The test were absolutely insane and the first one was the week my grandmother passed away after my grandfather died a few weeks before. She was completely unhelpful and said there was nothing that could be done about the daily I clicker points I\u2019d be missing for having to drive to New Orleans and help my mom with everything. I ended up making up the exam and gave it back to her saying it\u2019s not even worth grading. I took the 1 credit bio seminar next semester and of course she\u2019s one of the professors talking about their career and advice. She goes on to talk about how she dealt with family issues while in undergrad that affected her studies greatly and her advice was to just let your professors know and they will likely be more than understanding. My jaw was probably on the floor the whole seminar as that\u2019s exactly what I did and found her to be entirely unhelpful or understanding.",

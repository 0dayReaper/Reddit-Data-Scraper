For context, I plan to major in International Relations although I would like to major in finance and minor in International Relations instead.",

I transferred in, and absolutely loved it overall. Get involved in clubs that are sponsored by your college, do diverse things to expand your vision, talk to everyone, participate in the community. It is what you make it. I made friends with some folks who didn't do those things until I pushed them, and have stayed friends with them, and they have said they now wished they had participated more. Good luck and have fun.",

I participated in career clubs, was a president of one, made the road trips for promoting the college , and no one cared how old I was. Half of what you build a resume on in college is participating in your community. All those active clubs, that you're an officer of, show leadership to future employers. It shows that you did more than just show up to class. As someone older than your average freshman, you'll have experience that will let you excel. Embrace that.",

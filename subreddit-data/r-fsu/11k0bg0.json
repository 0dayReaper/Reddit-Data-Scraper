However, there are reserve caps. it will not let me process my classes. When I searched for it's title online it says :  \"Seats are reserved for students who are pursuing a major in Psychology or Neuroscience.\" -- which I am. Who do I contact regarding this? The academic advisor or someone else? Thank you so much!",

I heard about the LLC thing, and that the Discovery and Exploration (which my major falls under) community stays in Bryan Hall - I\u2019m interested, but I also want to know that where I\u2019m living is nice. For anyone who has stayed in Bryan Hall, what was your experience? Is it a pretty good place to stay?",

Very dated and small, but overall the experience was ok. My main frame of reference is when I stayed in Magnolia over the summer and the quality difference is night and day, but that's probably expected from buildings that are around 100 years apart.",

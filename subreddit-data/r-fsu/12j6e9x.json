There is a rule in Florida that says if you have an AA from a community/state college, then you're guaranteed admission to a Florida university.\n\nIf you get your AA, you should get in regardless of your GPA. You can get into any state university: FSU, UF, USF, UCF, etc. So take your pick.",

However, I believe in reality, you will be admitted to every public school you apply. Private schools don't follow this rule so don't expect to automatically get into UM, Rollins, Stetson, etc.",

It will depend on your program and the pre-reqs they require (we do mapping here), so that would be my biggest concern. Might be a good idea to reach out to an Academic Advisor in the major you want to be in, and make sure that you are meeting the program requirements when you enter.",

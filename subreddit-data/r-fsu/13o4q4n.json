    "postText": "Sorry if this is a dumb question but I can't figure out the answer from FSU's transfer credit policy. I feel like it might be a different situation than if I dual enrolled while still in high school.\n\nI'm graduating next month and will be a freshman in Fall 2023. I potentially have a bunch of AP credits, not at the 45-credit limit though. I also know I'll have to take some comp sci for my major, which I don't have credit for or any knowledge about. I thought about self-studying a little over the summer to get familiar with the basics, or I can take an introductory class for cheap at my local community college (not TCC, I'm out-of-state). If I take and pass this class this summer, can I transfer the credits to FSU? Thanks.",

The only going rule (LAW) is DO NOT TAKE MORE THE 11 credits after high school graduation because you\u2019ll suddenly be a transfer student snd your freshman admission will no longer apply.\nThat disclaimer said feel free to take a class or two.  Most CS type classes taken at a CC will just be electives and not count toward degree. Still a little intro head start is a good idea.  Make sure the CC sends the transcript after your grade is posted.",

As long as they are freshman and sophomore classes you can transfer them, I'm almost certain however that you are unavailable to transfer Junior and Senior level credits.",

With out-of-state schools it's a course by course evaluation whereas Florida colleges and universities use a common numbering system so courses with the same course number just automatically transfer over as the correct course.",

I got my summer classes, but I didn\u2019t get a class I needed for fall because it was full. The system won\u2019t allow me to add a different class so I don\u2019t have the number of credits I need (12 instead of 15). Can anyone help me figure out what to do? How do I add a class to my fall schedule?",

I'm not sure what you mean by the system not letting you type a number into the form. I was helping students register this afternoon and both myFSU class search and schedule assistant were working. \n\nIf you're able to email the advisor you spoke to today with screenshots of what's happening, that's probably going to be your best bet for help!",

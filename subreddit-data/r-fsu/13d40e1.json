    "postText": "My home institution is obviously FSU. If I am a full-time transient student at my local CC, am I still eligible for financial aid from FSU? I already know that I will have to pay for my classes out of pocket and receive my BF refund from FSU later down the line but I\u2019d like to know about the financial aid award as a whole. Thanks!",

She is taking one class online FSU and one on line at EFSC as transient.  I think she talked to EFSC about deferring payment for that curse as well until after dispersion.\n\nCall financial Aide for particulars.  I would do this with CC as well. For some reason EFSC had her as an out of state student and wanted to charge tuition accordingly.  She had graduated from EFSC with AA during Dual Enrollment in High school so I have no idea how they screwed up but they did and it  took several phone calls to rectify.",

Last year I took some at my local CC and some online with FSU &amp; I had no problem getting my financial aid refund. I know that you have to be a full-time student (6 hours for the summer) to receive aid but I\u2019m not sure if that applies to my transient institution or only FSU. I emailed and left a voicemail for the OFA &amp; haven\u2019t gotten a response. Waiting on hold with 15 people in front of me doesn\u2019t work either because I get dropped after about 30 minutes.",

FSU will delay award until last class starts.  \n\nYes getting through to financial aide is on of the harder things at FSU.\n\nDid you use the Transient Portal .... (IM dumb right now) I forget what its called.  If so, then you should be all set.",

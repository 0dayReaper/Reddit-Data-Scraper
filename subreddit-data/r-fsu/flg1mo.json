    "postText": "First, I'd like to preface this post by saying I have worked the last 2 years in a position that directly deals with data security, privacy, and compliance (specifically to security frameworks like NIST and ISO 27001). There are huge privacy concerns with FSU's decision to use HonorLock for exam proctoring and I will be including snippets of HonorLock's privacy policy to reiterate these concerns.\n___\n\n# Webcam Requirements\n&gt; You\u2019ll start by scanning the room with your webcam to ensure that no one else is present and that you\u2019re not using any external resources, and then we\u2019ll have you verify your identity by taking a picture of both yourself and your photo ID with your webcam. \n\nI, as well as many other students, did not sign up to take online courses this semester. I already operate on a very tight budget since I pay for school, housing, and food (in addition to other things like internet, cell phone, gas, etc) out of pocket. Requiring us to go buy a webcam (and yes I'm aware they're \"cheap\") when some of us live paycheck to paycheck is incredibly unfair. If FSU is mandating that physical campus students now buy additional items more than halfway into the semester, will they be giving us the money to do so or provide them to us? Doubtful.\n\n# Storing recordings of students that use the software, as well as keeping copies of our government and/or school ID\n&gt; After your test, one of our exam proctors may review the exam session to look for any potential violations, and the recording will also be sent to your instructor along with any notes from our proctors.\n\nPersonally, the idea of a third-party having full Video and Audio recordings of me feel like a huge invasion of my privacy. Further, the idea that **they can potentially keep these video/audio recordings of you (as well as photo copies of your government ID) for an indefinite period of time** is extremely concerning.\n\n# Storing non-related Information (e.g. your browser history, cookies, and running processes)\n&gt; Like most websites today, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers. The log files contain data about the nature of such access, including the device\u2019s IP address, user agent string (e.g., operating system and browser type/version), and referral URL (i.e., the external source by which you arrived at our Website, or the pages you\u2019ve clicked on while on our Website). We may use these log files for purposes such asassisting in monitoring and troubleshooting errors and incidents, analyzing web traffic, or optimizing the user experience. \n\nThis is self-explanatory, **they are tracking everything you do while you run their software**, a proprietary and closed-source browser extension that REQUIRES google chrome (a notorious piece of software for data collection and telemetry). They are also potentially reading network traffic (again without an explicit disclosure of how their software works, we can't really know what data they're collecting), which may not even be related to the student and could be someone else that lives in the building (if on a shared network)... a huge no-no.\n\n# Distributing aggregated data among Third-Parties/Business Partners (aka selling your information to other companies)\n&gt; In an ongoing effort to better understand our Visitors and the Website, we might analyze your information in aggregate form to carry out, maintain, manage, and improve operations in connection with the Website. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services and the Website to current and prospective business partners and to otherthird parties for other lawful purposes. \n\n**They're going to sell whatever data they can to third-parties**. This is standard language used by websites like Facebook.\n\n# Encryption of Data\n&gt; We use secure encrypted protocols to save and view all student assets. Honorlock\u2019s certified proctors and your institution\u2019s faculty are able to review test session videos until they are deleted based on the school\u2019s retention policy. \n\n**Nowhere on their site, or in the browser extension is an actual description of what type of \"encryption\" is being used** in the transmission of any data that occurs on your computer (or on your network - which may include other people who do not give consent to being monitored) while their browser extension is running. This is a HUGE red flag in terms of their potential capability to distribute decryption methods/keys to third-parties. For those that don't know much about data encryption just read that sentence as if it said the following: \"We're installing locks on your doors, but we're not going to tell you what kind of locks or who we gave the key to.\" Also, what is a \"certified proctor\"? What exactly are they certified in? Do they hold FERPA certifications? Do they hold any security or data compliance certifications? These are questions that should be addressed in their privacy policy.\n\n# Potential Violation of FERPA\nAccording to FSU's [own policies](https://dsst.fsu.edu/newnole/resources/student-privacy-parental-access):\n\n&gt; **Any record that is maintained by an institution and that can personally identify a student or group of students is an educational record**. Since FERPA is technology independent, these records can consist of any number of media, including but not limited to files, documents, tapes, disks, film, microfilm, and microfiche.\n\nI would consider Video recordings of our persons, and our homes (which have incredibly strong privacy laws to begin with) a violation of FERPA. Additionally, HonorLock has a [legal clause that **forces you to personally authorize them as an exemption to FERPA in order to use the software**](https://honorlock.com/ferpa/).\n___\n\nIn the end, we shouldn't be forced to have a third-party company invade our privacy, and give up our personal information by installing what is in reality **glorified spyware** on our computers. It's bad enough that we aren't getting what we paid for, don't make us give up our privacy just because it's more convenient for the administration and colleges.\n\nWe have a right to privacy according to the University's own policies and I urge the administration to protect and maintain our rights.\n___\n\n# Edits Below:\n\n* It's important to remember that this is an unprecedented situation for the University, and guidelines from the CDC regarding social distancing really limit the options available to the administration. In the meantime, I encourage all of you to voice your concerns to your Deans, College Faculty, and the administrators at Student Affairs.\n\n* /u/Vexas posted a lot of info relevant to the company's CEO (who was demoted) and it's financials [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/fsu/comments/flg1mo/some_important_info_regarding_honorlock_and_why_i/fkynx1p/).\n  * It appears just today, HonorLock received funding of $11.5 million from a private equity firm called Defy Partners. Just a quick look into this company, I was able to find out that both Neil Sequiera (the managing director mentioned in the linked article) as well as Trae Vassallo (another managing director and co-founder of Defy) both have strong links (they are board members) to other companies located in big data analytics or business intelligence sectors (i.e. they work for companies that profit off of mass data collection).\n* [Reviews on the Extension we'd need to install](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/honorlock/hnbmpkmhjackfpkpcbapafmpepgmmddc)\n* [You can submit this document to block directory information from being released (since \"directory information\" such as your name and address are exempt from FERPA protections)](https://registrar.fsu.edu/forms/prevent_info_publication.pdf)\n  * It would be great if anyone with legal expertise in this area could chime in on whether or not this protects you from having to disclose any info to HonorLock.\n  * **Here is a list of information not protected by FERPA (considered \"directory information\"), unless you fill out the above form**:\n     * Name\n     * Date and place of birth\n     * Local address\n     * Permanent address\n     * Telephone number (if listed)\n     * Classification\n     * Major\n     * Participation in official University activities and sports\n     * Weight and height of athletic team members\n     * Dates of attendance\n     * Degrees, honors, and awards received\n     * Most recently attended educational institution\n     * Digitized FSUCard photo\n* Someone made a [petition](https://www.change.org/p/president-john-thrasher-ask-fsu-to-refrain-from-using-honorlock-which-blatantly-violates-privacy-rights) that you can sign if you want, the most effective thing we can do right now is bringing as much awareness as we can to all students, faculty, and administration.",

Atleast some students get loaners, but with no cams.\n\nIt would make more sense to me to enable use of testing centers alongside this new system for such edge cases.  Reduce max number of test takers, stretch out finals over 2 weeks or so and clean/sanitize each station after every use.",

It will only impact a very small percentage of students, but there still needs to be a plan to help them. The university I work for has one, and I\u2019m guessing FSU is working on one as well.",

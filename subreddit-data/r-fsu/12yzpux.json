It\u2019s generally not that busy, especially the third floor, and it also has study rooms that you can reserve if you have a library card. \nIf you\u2019re cool with people nearby, Calvin\u2019s coffee shop is nice. If you like to be outside but with few people, I used to study by the amphitheater behind kuersteiner. There\u2019s a little fountain garden.",

Calvin's is also cool, and if you want somewhere a little more niche and not a coffee shop a lot of the apartment complexes in college town have really nice study areas and it's not that hard to get in as the buildings require a key fob but most people will let you in",

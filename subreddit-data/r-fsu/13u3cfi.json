I don't think they really consider SAT scores unless you have something extremely low/high. I personally had a 1330, but I know people who had scores in the 1100-1200 range and made it. Personally, I would focus on writing a great personal statement and writing sample. A good portfolio would help, but I would say just focus on what shows you off as a storyteller if that makes sense. Hope this helped.",

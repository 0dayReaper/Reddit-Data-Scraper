No reason to waste money on general education classes at a university when you can get them half-price with probably higher grades at a community college.\n\nYou can also attend Tallahassee Community College which is only a mile away from FSU if you want, have a seamless transfer, and start the FSU social life from day one if you decide to leave home early.",

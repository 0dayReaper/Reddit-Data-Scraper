    "postText": "Title pretty much sums it up. I\u2019m a freshman with 65 credit hours. I currently have a 4.0 (based on 13 hours from last semester which was my first semester at fsu), but I feel like that 4.0 will be gone because of managerial accounting and another class. I don\u2019t know if I want to go to grad school yet, but if I do I want to know what gpa is typically needed. Please drop any advice or resources that can help :). \n\nThank you in advance fellow redditors!",

You will need recommendation letters for many grad programs and having a good relationship with a number of people makes that easier. Plus a more personalized letter is much better than a \u201c he was in my class. He did good\u2026\u201d type letter.",

            "comment": "If you're looking to get into FSU's college of business grad programs (other universities may obviously be different), you need a 3.0 upper division GPA (think of that as your last sixty hours and/or 3000 and 4000 level courses - every college and program can define that a little differently). But a lot of times solid work experience helps balance out if your GPA is hovering just above the 3.0 line. Strong test scores can help if the program requires an entrance exam (GRE, GMAT, etc).\u00a0",

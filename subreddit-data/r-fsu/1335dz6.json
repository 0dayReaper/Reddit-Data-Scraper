    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all, I\u2019m an incoming freshman majoring in CS and i had a question about the Computer Science BS requirements. On the course flowchart given to me by the advisors, they list MAC1105 (College Algebra), MAC1140 (Precalc) and MAC114 (Trigonometry) as degrees requirements. I essentially took all those topics as high schools classes and am currently taking Calculus, so do I need to take these three classes if they\u2019re on my high school transcript? It seems ridiculous to make me retake these classes when I took them 1-2 years ago and i\u2019m currently in a more advanced class.",

However again no matter your credits you must take the test (obviously if you have the credits to skip the class it doesn\u2019t matter if you do well on the test or not but still try)",

There may be a few exceptions (I know Theatre specifically has some offerings).\n\nHowever, I know one of my instructors in undergrad was a grad student and she did field work in Italy, and a couple of my professors in my current grad program have done conferences and research abroad. There may be opportunities for you to plug in through your specific program; you'd just want to speak to your faculty advisor and let them know it's something you're interested in if possible.",

They don\u2019t offer general education courses obviously since you won\u2019t need those in a Masters program. Instead, you\u2019d have to enroll in a specific program in one of the study center locations. When I did study abroad two Summers ago, my program included graduate students. We had the same classes, they just had a few extra pages required on their papers and such. If you can\u2019t find something specific to your field, you might look at doing an exchange instead (FSU does Global Exchange, just not sure if that\u2019s open to grad students or not).",

It's more expected and accommodated at the undergraduate level as others have mentioned. As grads it's a 'make it happen yourself' kind of situation because it' s not often that you will meet course requirements abroad. If you really want to study abroad I would encourage you to apply to foreign universities.",

It depends on the program however and I would discuss it with your advisor. Research also presents an opportunity to study abroad, depending on your field of study.",

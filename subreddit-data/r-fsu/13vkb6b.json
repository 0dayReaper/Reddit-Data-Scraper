    "postText": "Hey guys! For college I currently have a choice between FSU and USF and I\u2019m kind of torn. On one hand, FSU is supposed to be better for my major and has more a college scene while USF is kind of a commuter school, while still offering the opportunities that big cities do. Also it has an international airport which is a plus as I travel a lot. \n\nI\u2019m transferring and my old school was in a village which I absolutely despised. I\u2019ve always seen myself in the big city and USF will give me that. However, I don\u2019t have a solid idea on how big Tallahassee is. In terms of chains, my old school only had a Walmart. I have done the going to frat parties shebang but I\u2019m not sure if I wanna do that again. I can\u2019t go to bars in Tallahassee either as I\u2019ll be 20 when I graduate. I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll be depressed and out of things to do. I don\u2019t have a car either. \n\nShould I pick the big city over FSU?\n\nEDIT: since tuition is practically the same, FSU would be cheaper considering it\u2019s Tallahassee. Also, I\u2019m going for pre-med and I was attracted to USF as it has several hospitals on and near campus.",

Sure, Tampa is a \u201cbig city,\u201d but it\u2019s really just a suburban hellscape with little to do imo. If I were you, I would go to FSU for your degree(s), then move to the big city afterwards. The college town vibe is too good to ignore (I don\u2019t go to bars or parties, it\u2019s still great).\n\nBut really, visit both campuses sometime and make your own decision. And please don\u2019t just visit one and go with it, that\u2019s what I did 2 years ago when I chose USF and continued to hate my decision.",

                            "comment": "Not too difficult. I was denied my first try because I didn't meet my major's upper level prerequisites at the time. So I spent another semester at USF to get my AA degree and complete my prerequisites. I reapplied before that semester for the next semester and they accepted me within a week under the condition that I get my AA and do the prerequisites before attending.\n\nMy major is Computer Science. Pretty much all my credits transferred over\u2014specifically general education and prerequisite classes (Calculus II, Physics II, Prob/Stats, etc.) For some reason USF doesn't have CS students start CS classes until their 3rd or 4th semester, so I barely had any to transfer. My only one was \"Programming Concepts\" which didn't transfer. Also, since USF's CS major is in the Engineering College and FSU's isn't, I had to take some engineering courses (Foundations of Engineering and Lab) that didn't transfer over at all.\n\nTransferring set me back one or two semesters because of some credits not transferring and additional requirements (specifically language requirement), but I will still be graduating in 4 years total.\n\nI transferred because USF's CS department hardly exists and every experience I had with it at that point was awful, USF raised the CS upper level GPA requirements to push people out of the program (I know many people who changed majors) and I would have had to retake like 3 classes without being certain I would do better at them, I wanted more independence from my family, and I had wanted to attend FSU in the first place but decided not to originally because I lived near USF.\n\nI've only been at FSU for one semester so far and I enjoyed that one semester much more than my previous semesters. The department is better, the professors are better, the area is better, I've made more friends here, I've somehow gotten more scholarships here, and I love the independence I got with moving away from home. I wish I had started at FSU, but you live and you learn I guess.  \n\n\nP.S. Sorry for the long response. Hope it helps.",

I think you are going to need to prioritize what's more important to you - cost of city living vs education.\n\nTallahassee has the lack of resources like a small town and the crime rate of a big city. Not much to do outside of the school; it's wild to see how to morale of the city is completely dependent on FSU football. It is much cheaper than Tampa and easier to get around without a car. There are two hospitals there that are perfectly fine for interns and residents. FSU is an incredible school.\n\n There is so much more to do in Tampa, but you'd need a car to do any of it. Tampa is expensive. There are more hospital systems as well, TGH, Advent, Moffitt, the VA, etc. More specialized care, more opportunities for med students.\n\n\nTo be honest, I hated living in Tallahassee every second I was there, and left to go home to Tampa the first chance I got, although my FSU experience was world class. My husband graduated from USF and it was nothing impressive. My student debt was much less because I opted to live in a city that I hated for 8 years.

Traveling is absolutely terrible and you won't get a big city vibe here. \n\nUnless you are okay with fried chicken, mattress stores, and car washes, Tallahassee has nothing for you other than football gameday.\n\nTo get to the nearest city. It is two hours (Jax), and flights in TLH are overpriced.\n\nPro:\nBeautiful nature, some of the best parks in the state,\n\nBeautiful campus,\n\nGreat student life,\n\nRailroad square,\n\nCollegetown,\n\nOn-campus facilities (union, aslc, leach, IM fields).\n\nFaculty are amazing,\n\nGameday is the best here,\n\nLandis Green\n\n\nCon:\n\nNo downtown,\n\nNo real midtown,\n\nNot a city (more like a large town),\n\nYou will go to another campus and go \"wow, FSU really did not spend as much money as they should have for this cool thing every other college has\",\n\nLoved restaurants can and will die constantly here,\n\nGetting out of tallahassee is either an expensive nightmare or long and annoying drive (I-10 is the literal worst),\n\nThe locals can and will hate you,\n\nYou will learn to hate the locals and their terrible hamster wheel attention span on why the trashy thing that just opened is a godsend (Currently a Sbarro in a gas station. Was raising canes last month, was a Farm Store at some point too).\n\nCrime sucks here if you live on the wrong streets near campus",

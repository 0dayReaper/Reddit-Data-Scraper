    "postText": "About a month ago, I completed applying as a transfer to the school of education that had an application deadline of April 1st. Frank Amidon, academic support coordinator, told me directly that I had all materials in. After sometime, I emailed FSU admissions to see if they had an estimate of when I would hear back, and they responded with early April.\n\nI know it is still early April, but I'm just so eager to receive my decision. Does anyone have any advice or knowledge on this situation?  \n\n\nUPDATE: I GOT IN!!!!",

Frank said a lot of essays were turned in the day applications closed so it was taking them a little longer to get through them. I say just wait until at least the 21st. Also be aware your decision could come at any time mine came at 8:30pm on a Friday.\n\nAlso, the decision email comes from George Green and his emails don\u2019t get marked important, so don\u2019t overlook it.",

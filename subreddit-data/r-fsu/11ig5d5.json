I will say that it does require a bit of work but that's just me since I am in moving into an IT major from education.\n\n Some suggestion that I will say is that you need to plan your time management well since your deadlines are always due after two weeks after the last lesson. Also, you have to buy the textbook since it is where most of your assignments come from. Make sure you study too because depending on what professor you have, you might have closed-note exams. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut overall the class is good, you just have to put in the effort. And one last thing, if you run into any difficulties, GO TO OFFICE HOURS! DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE WITH LIS 2360 AT THE SAME TIME! (I am paying the price because you are supposed to take them separately.)",

I have some experience with other coding languages so maybe that\u2019s why I find it so easy, but all assignments are via mylab which allows for unlimited attempts.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am planning to transfer to FSU after completing my AA degree at TCC this summer.  I am in my final semester and due to receive my AA this summer.\n\nI started at TCC in 2019 and am just now about to finish (a number of factors contributed to me being very slow to obtain my AA, including work, changing my major twice, and being horrible at math).  I am taking two math classes (MAC1105C and MGF1107) and ECO2013 to satisfy my last elective so I can get my AA and ultimately transfer to FSU.  I have withdrawn from several attempts at different math classes, before I signed up for MAC1105C since that class is a pre-requisite for my major.\n\nI'm majoring in Hospitality and Tourism Management.  I have been working for Marriott for two years now and knew from the moment I started that this was my career, which is what ultimately caused me to change my major the second time, from Business to Hospitality.\n\nFor taking much longer than normal to obtain my AA am I likely in jeopardy of being accepted into my major?  I have a 3.01 GPA right now but with my grades being very good at the moment (2 A's and a B) that is likely to climb a bit.  I applied for Fall 2023 and was deferred (not denied) due to not having my math credits yet and was told to send in my updated transcript once I finish my math credits.  Will I be ok to submit my updated official transcript after this summer and still be able to start this fall, or should I reapply for Spring 2024?  Thanks so much you guys! :-)",

I finished a statistics class at TCC two weeks before I started classes at FSU. They just give you a provisional acceptance pending completion of the class, and as long as you send them your final transcript when you\u2019re done they change it to a full acceptance.",

Once you have your prerequisite classes finished you\u2019ll be accepted unless you have less than a 2.0 (which you don\u2019t). I\u2019m actually taking an IT leadership class at FSU currently and will be working on a project specifically helping transfer students to get into FSU. Shoot me a message if you have any specific questions. Cheers",

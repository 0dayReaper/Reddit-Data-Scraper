I\u2019m not entirely familiar with the hours BUT I believe it\u2019s from 5 pm - 11 pm on weekdays. Not sure at all about weekend hours. Consider checking out the track team\u2019s website for clearer info!",

I\u2019ve been doing it for years and never have. The side gate is always open and the slots on the gates are pretty big.",

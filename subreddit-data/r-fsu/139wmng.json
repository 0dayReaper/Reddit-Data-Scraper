    "postText": "Hello! I am a senior expecting to graduate this summer with a B.S. in economics, and am about to begin an accounting internship in a few weeks. The problem is that it only lasts through the summer, and I don\u2019t have a job lined up afterwards, and am unsure what I want to do afterwards. I confess, I should have been much more proactive in my job search earlier. I created both LinkedIn and NoleNetwork accounts, and sat down with a career liaison, but mostly neglected searching for a job during my time here. \n\nI have a few questions for Econ major graduates. Did you know what you wanted to do with your degree? How did you land your job(s) after graduation? I\u2019m asking because I strongly suspect I will spend the bulk of my free time looking for a job over the summer, so any advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated.",

If you do well they\u2019ll likely offer you a job at the end.\n\nEcon majors can apply for any business related job. Market research is a popular field for them, business analyst jobs, even Human Resources jobs are available.\n\nIndeed and LinkedIn are generally the best platforms to apply on.",

            "comment": "Start with the firm where you are interning. Be nice to everyone - some firms will ask the receptionists, admin assistants, etc for feedback on interns. An intern who is arrogant or rude to the receptionist could cost themself a job offer. Get your assignments done and try to meet as many people as you can. Network the office. If that office ends up not hiring, the people you meet there may help you with a lead and a reference. If they have social events, have a drink or two but do not get drunk. The places I have worked viewed the internship as an extended interview to determine whether we could stand to be around this person all day and whether they exhibit poor judgment. \n\nAs a graduating senior, could you make a post for incoming Econ freshman with advice on courses to take or avoid, professors to take or avoid, and other advice you wish you knew as a freshman?",

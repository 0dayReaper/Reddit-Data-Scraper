    "postText": "So I want to get into swimming as a form of weight loss/general exercise. I know FSU has a lap pool I can use but I want to know a bit more about using the pool. Do they have lockers? Showers? For the women who use it, do you feel safe/comfortable? Are pinkeye or yeast infections a concern? How often is the pool cleaned and when is it open?\n\nI have a pool in my community but it\u2019s not a lap pool and it\u2019s fairly small. Is the pool at FSU worth it?",

They have gender specific locker rooms with showers and lockers in the area where the pool is similar to those in the front part of the leach. The pool is chlorinated and cleaned regularly by campus rec maintenance. I would say the pool is worth it.",

            "comment": "I have been a good number of times this semester and have felt plenty comfortable everytime Ive been. The pool has ever really been busy in the evenings when there are practices going on. It is chlorinated and indoors, but the fans are really good and you can barely even smell it. There is a little bit of gear like kickboards and the like that you can use that they have set up on the deck. The pool edge is pretty high but they have a set of stairs on the shallow end to make getting in/ out easier. You get to the pool by going through the lockers/ showers area that connects the the first floor lobby in between the gear rental desk and the stairs in the back. Sorry its a wall of words, but if you have any other questions, feel free to reach out.",

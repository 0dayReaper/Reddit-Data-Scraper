            "comment": "Currently living in Dorman. It\u2019s clean, really nice. I love the courtyard (we share one with Deviney). We are very close to the Union and Landis. It\u2019s an extremely short walk if you know where to go. \n\nWarning that we are beside a Dennys and the Traditions Parking Garage. Depending on where ur room is you may be woken up by drunk folks at some times of the night, or by fire trucks and such\u2026 or just people revving their engines. \n\nOverall it\u2019s pretty good. I think the environment is fine but the people are likely to change each academic year so don\u2019t put too much stock into what I say here. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s a newer dorm. Elevators work well, never had them break down. People often set off the fire alarm but maybe that will change with your year. Also, we have had multiple scheduled water outages that end up fixed within a couple hours. None of these really negatively affect my view of the dorm though. \n\nI like it here and it\u2019s peaceful. It\u2019s kind of central to most things and at night it\u2019s cool bc you hear everything going on (when outside). \nIf you have many classes in the Psych building it\u2019s like a 5-10 minute walk depending on your speed. Diffenbaugh isn\u2019t too far. Even if you take a shortcut you have to walk up a hill.",

There are also lots of cool things around Reynolds, landis green, Powell green, and Calvin\u2019s coffee. Az is nice but I wouldn\u2019t want to spend longer than a summer there.",

Plus if the laundry is ever full, you can walk to the next hall- and same goes for study rooms. They all surround the dining hall, and have CFA and a mini mart next to it as well. Landis, the library, and most freshman classes are near that area too! Highly recommend.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm currently a freshman at FSU who will be living on-campus next year Fall 2023-Spring 2024. I completed the housing contract in the allocated time and made all required payments.\n\nIt seems like we are now allowed to make our room selection through the housing portal. I'm going to the housing portal and selecting the building/room type I would like, but every time I do so I get the message \"There are no rooms available that match your search. Please search again.\"\n\nIs this just a glitch, or am I messing up something?",

So if you have 60 (not counting this semester) then you are a Junior to them.\n\nAs for upperclassmen being randomly assigned to suite dorms, yes. I just transferred this Spring semester as a Junior and I got put into Degraff West. My roommate, who isn\u2019t a transfer but is a Junior and almost a Senior, got put here last Fall because he lost the housing lottery.",

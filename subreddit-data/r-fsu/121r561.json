            "comment": "Many people get minors because most of the classes they need for that minor are already inherent in their major. Sometimes it only requires one extra course. It's quite common.\n\nJust ask yourself why. Getting minors usually doesn't do anything for your future prospects. So if you are already close to getting the minor and it only involves an extra class or two that you are really interested in and is relevant to the niche you want to do in your career, then I say go for it. It'll help you get educated and make connections.\n\nJust don't give yourself more work because you think you'll get more clout. No employer will give a hoot about what minors you got in college. Zero.",

And then I kept enjoying the classes and decided to declare it as a second major. And *then* I decided hell why not get a dual degree, with a minor for each (I had enough credits already that this only meant a couple of classes more). \n\nIn the end, I was able to do all of this in four years without taking on more than 15 credit hour semesters and burning out, because it\u2019s what I wanted to learn about. And if you want to do more-in-four and have the credits to do it easily, more power to you. You can always end up not doing the second minor if you don\u2019t have the time.",

How would you approach it so that you can maximize classes to finish within 4 years?  I'll be starting either in Marketing or Entrepreneurship.  I would love to do More-In-Four, but I don't have any credits. Any words of advice would be greatly appreciated.",

So for example if you were a political science major, you could take economics as the bigger focus in the interdisciplinary social sciences major and the smaller focus could be geography or sociology.  Double majors will show up on your degree while minors don\u2019t.",

How were you able to do that?  How many of the Signature Classes did you have to take?  I'm interesting in pursuing a Marketing degree, so those classes don't interest me.",

There are just too many educated people and depressed salaries, thanks to several governors worth of administrations who have gutted and held down the salaries of the state workforce. If you're able to find remote work or move, I think you'll find your job prospects pretty good as long as the economy continues to hold.\n\nCongrats on your acceptace!",

I graduated from FIT in Melbourne and can't wait to go to a larger school, I wonder how big the program is. I'll see you in class!",

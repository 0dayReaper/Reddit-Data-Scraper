I didn\u2019t even think abt setting up an appointment so I\u2019ll get on that ASAP.\n\nIt\u2019s been such a run around.\nI called the CGE last week to ask about it and the person I talked to was no help. She just said to talk to the financial aid office and when I called that office they said to talk to my academic dean of my major. She also had no idea abt the scholarship and sent me the info from the website to try to help:\u2019)",

    "postText": "Hi! I'll be attending FSU starting in their Summer B term but I have a question about the housing move-in date(s). On their website, it says that classes for the Summer B term starts June 26 but the \"residence halls open\" on June 22. This worries me a little because my sister's wedding is on June 23. \n\nDo I have from June 22 to June 25 to move into my dorm? So preferably, I would like to move in either June 24 or June 25 so I don't miss this event. Sorry if this question is redundant but any help would be appreciated!",

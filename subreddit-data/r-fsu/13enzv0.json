She was admitted to FSU as freshman and it would have been nice to know what transferred (eventually every credit transferred) before discussing her freshman schedule.  The transfer credit report didn\u2019t get done until after she registered which happens during orientation.",

I\u2019m new to the country (moved here a year and a half ago) and I don\u2019t know of someone that has transferred with an AA, I have no one to ask to and I\u2019m really lost, I don\u2019t know how to do the statement, it would be really helpful to get an idea of how she did it (if she had to) thank youu anyways!! I hope you can help me",

Yes she had to write a personal statement which is a short essay that explains who you are and what you are about.  What subjects are you passionate about, what\u2019s it like being an immigrant navigating a new system, hobbies etc.  basically show them you\u2019re a great inspired person who will make a good addition to their school.  \nAre you applying as a freshman or actual transfer?  If actual transfer then tell them what you want to major in and what you want to do with your degree.\n\nExpect questions about 94 credits , they really don\u2019t like to transfer  above 90 because you must earn your last 30 credits at the school in order for them to award your degree. This means s an accreditation thing out to f the schools control.  On the upside my daughter had enough of the right creditors Td so that she only needed 30 credits for her BA in international affairs.",

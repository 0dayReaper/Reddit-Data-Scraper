    "postText": "How can a freshman get into ChemE car? There's too many requirements for the course that I don't feel like doing or are necessary for a course that's basically the business of STEM. (FYI: I'm technically a sophomore by hours and have an A in CHM 1045) \n\n If anyone knows how I can get into this class please let me know!",

            "comment": "You literally just stated that you knew it had a bunch of requirements but you don't want to do them. If that is your attitude about chemical engineering I would strongly reccomend switching out of the college of engineering before you waste any time.\n\nI hope this was a joke but I'm gunna tell you right now that that having an A halfway through general chemistry 1 does not qualify you to compete in a senior chemical engineering project. \n\nIn fact, before you spend 5 years of your life on chemical engineering, you should know that its literally the most work of any major at FSU, and that there's actually very little chemistry. In fact, all of the classes you will take your first 2 years are just *minimum* requirements to even pursue the major, and we have a lot of classes that are an unnecessary amount of work just to weed people out.\n\nAfter year 1, the most people quit in their junior year because those classes are brutal relative to what you would have seen the year before. It's the biggest jump.\n\nIt is a running joke that everyone who did chemical engineering did it because they thought it would be chemistry, but it's basically all physics and reaction kinetics.",

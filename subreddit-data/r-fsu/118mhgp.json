    "postText": "\nI recently got admitted to Florida State and it\u2019s definitely in my top 3 but I\u2019m having a hard time deciding. I figured the best way to find out the best choice would be to ask students who ready go there and get their honest opinion. I guess you guys could probably help out. I\u2019m from Miami and right now it\u2019s between FSU , UofSC, Penn State, Ohio State, and maybe Ole miss or LSU. \n\nWhat are the main Pros and Cons from your guys time at FSU? Anything I should be considering or be worried about ?\n\nI was also wondering if there was a platform I could get in direct contact with a student outside of Reddit. Thanks",

If you just want undergrad then FSU will be by far the cheapest while also delivering an education rated as high or higher than all those other schools. \n\nDepending on your major FSU might just have one of the top schools in the nation.",

            "comment": "Heads up, this is gonna be long.\n\nIf I have learned anything about my time here, your experience at FSU will hinge on two things; what you are looking to get out of college and what you are willing to put into it. Since I am not super familiar with the current culture of most of the universities you have on your list, I will use UF and FSU as comparisons. If you were interested in a liberal arts major I would recommend coming to FSU, but if you were more interested in hard science (particularly if you are looking at graduate school) I would recommend UF. This isn't just about what programs they offer but the faculty that teach there and their specialties as well as university-affiliated opportunities like RSOs (clubs) and university sponsor job learning opportunities. Look at what kinds of experiential learning courses they offer (think courses that are designed to get you accustomed to how your career field will operate).  Additionally, look at how hard it is to get your hands on the opportunities that you are interested in.\n\nBut degrees aren't all that make a good university experience. It is important to have a life outside of your academics. In some schools this is pretty much Greek life and Greek life only, others have less of a focus on that. Are there RSOs that fit any hobbies you have that are free to join on campus? Do they have requirements to join and what are they? If you don't see an RSO that fits your hobbies, how easy is it to make one? At FSU it is fairly easy to make an RSO so long as you have enough people, though it is more difficult to maintain that status and get funding. In other schools it is harder to become an RSO but easier to maintain once the status is achieved. \n\nLook at how the campus is laid out. FSU is fairly centralized into one main area and you don't have to cross many roads to get to different colleges, with exceptions for a few graduate schools and the engineering campus. This is really important if you plan to live on campus, you don't want to miss out on a class because it takes forever to get from one place to another on campus. If you plan to live off campus, think about how you are going to get on campus. Are there buses, do you plan to bike, are you driving, and if so what does parking look like? You can get from one end of campus to the next in 15 minutes - provided you know the right route - and even faster on a bike. However, parking can be a bit tricky for those driving. You learn where to park and how to schedule for finding a spot once you get here though, I have only missed one class due to parking issues and only been late twice (I have been here for 3 years btw, so plenty of time to have made a mistake). \n\nFor me, FSU has been great. being from South Florida I can speak from personal experience and say it is not the same culture. Sure there are similarities because it's the same state, but it does not feel the same at all. There isn't a lot of tourism compared to down south or even places like Jacksonville. On that note, if you do have a car it is easy to go to events in Pensacola and Jacksonville because they are about a 3-hour drive one way. Orlando is closer to 4 hours and Gainesville is about 2 1/2.  We also have an international airport in tally if that matters to you. We might not be the center of attention year-round (our tourist season is around home games and the legislative season) like Miami but we aren't isolated and there are plenty of local businesses and organizations that have interesting stuff going on. Check out the Railroad Art District, the Mission San Louis, Lake Ella, and Cascades Park for example. \n\nAs for FSU itself, check out NoleCentral to see the different organizations and events running on campus. There is Club DownUnder, paint-a-pot, the bowling alley, Midnight Movie at the ASLC, gaming nights, a Quidditch team (goes by Quadball now), at least three university-run magazines, a film club, several theatre clubs, multiple comic/card game focused clubs (recent addition has been the Magic the Gathering club), several identities focused unions and identity focused clubs, and my personal favorite Humans vs. Zombies (look it up, just trust me). With every club comes the e-board and every club leads to connections. I know at least three engineering students and I am a Psychology and English major. \n\nSome might worry about the Greek life and FSU being a party school, but as someone that isn't interested in that, I have never had to interact with it. My best advice for choosing would be to go to the schools themselves and talk to people there. For example, FSU has Market Wednesday, where vendors and RSOs post up on Legacy Walk to reach out to the student population. Walk up to someone tabling and ask them about their experience at FSU, in-person contact will give you a much better picture of what the vibe of FSU is like. I would do this for any other schools you are looking at as well. It really does come down to how much you reach out to those around you. I would also say, if you are looking and feel overwhelmed and don't know what it is you want, take a gap year. FSU has a Gap year program and the Gap Year Fellowship program also provides need-based funding. \n\nLastly, talk with your parents or trusted adults about the finances of every school. It's not just tuition and supplies, but food costs, board or rent, transportation costs, whether you will need to buy new clothes to accommodate the weather, and other such things. Where is your financial support coming from and how stable is it/is it contingent on other things, and how might you be able to minimize debt? For example, the InternFSU program guarantees a pay rate of $13 an hour for 120 hours of work over the course of a semester. Also, Engage 100-course leaders are frequently paid for their work. Look into these things because college is supposed to be a transition into adulthood and independence and financial freedom is part of that.  \n\nHope this helps and feel free to ask me any questions!",

Met life long friends who I stay in touch with nearly a decade later.\n\nCons: If you have any history of addiction or alcoholism personally or in your family please be careful. FSU is a big party school, even outside of Greek Life. I got two degrees at FSU and did a lot of hard drinking, etc., and I am now a year sober. I regret nothing, really, but I wish I had someone looking out for me when I was getting into it all. This is oddly personal and weirdly specific advice, but it is what I have to offer you.\n\n\nPace yourself. Be safe. Have the wild times but make sure you make it out. Some people don\u2019t.\n\nOther than that, it depends on your major. FSU has good programs but some are leagues ahead of others. Match your interest with each school\u2019s strengths.\n\nGood luck.",

Like if you want to enjoy sports, join a frat/sorority, excel academically, party hard, speeches, join clubs of all varieties, or anything you think of on a college campus it is probably here. Not to mention, I came from out of state and the tuition is lower here than some of my in state alternative options were, so I can say I would highly recommend especially if you are already in state. Here is the nice part of your decision making process though, any of the colleges from that list you\u2019ll probably love and won\u2019t know that another one could\u2019ve potentially been better because they are all awesome institutions in their own right.",

Still might not be worth the cost unless you got some scholarship money.\n\nFWIW I\u2019ve been to all four campuses and many more. FSU is one of the nicest campuses I\u2019ve walked on and the kids seem happy.",

            "comment": "As someone who had intended to go to Penn State and is now at FSU, I highly suggest looking into whether going out of state is something you can afford financially. While I had received scholarships from both schools, I realized that going out of state and potentially having a lot of debt as a result was not as feasible as staying in state and benefiting from bright futures and Florida prepaid. Ultimately, every school is going to have its pros and cons that differ from person to person and I think one of FSU's biggest pros is its affordability for in state students.",

            "comment": "I think your opinion of college is going to be highly dependent on what you want to get out of it, and what degree you've chosen to pursue.\n\nI came into this wanting a B.S. in chemistry, with the goal of getting into a Ph.D program. My goal was successful. I will graduate this semester, and I received an acceptance at an Ivy league school to pursue a Ph.D in inorganic chemistry.\n\nThat said, this project has made me absolutely miserable. I work outside of school to ensure I don't have to take loans, and I've worked endlessly to ensure my grades would be sufficient to get me into a graduate program. This semester is the first I've had in who knows how long that I have a day off.\n\nI burnt myself out and killed any joy that school brought me. My studies and work kept me from socializing as much as I'd like, and to be quite frank, I regret my decisions greatly.\n\nIf your degree is in an easier field, you may find that burnout is not a significant problem, and you may also find that the effort required to get grades adequate for grad school is minimal, which brings me to my next point.\n\nWhy are you going to college? You should internalize this, and find an answer that you are truly happy with. If your goal is just to party and have a good time, you'll be in good company at FSU. The academic performance of a lot of our students is abysmal. Too many people know too little because their only interest is partying rather than studying. If instead you actually want to pursue academics, FSU is perfectly good, but note that you will have a harder time finding people with a similar passion. \n\nMy greatest complaint about FSU is the inequality between departments and students. FSU's economics and business departments get a lot of donations from large companies. As you might be able to gather from this, their lecture halls and buildings are amazing, meanwhile, save for CSL, the new chemistry building, the arts and science buildings are lacking in quality. A ridiculous amount of money goes into FSU athletics. Students involved in athletics have their meds paid for by FSU, even meds not related to conditions caused by their participation in FSU athletics. They also get access to a special dining hall that provides significantly higher quality food than the other places on campus.\n\nI don't think many of these problems are unique to FSU, so just go into things eyes wide open, unlike what I did. College is a business and you are just a number to FSU. Don't imagine this place as anything more than a business. Think long and hard about what will make you happy, and choose carefully.",

I've made a lot of friends here (in grad school), but I will be honest and say there's a lot more stupid stuff that happens here than I'd like. Like sure, it's funny when a car drives on the student union stairs but the fact just complete idiocy like that occurs on the daily is worrying. \n\nAlso, don't get me started on the number of people who seem fine drunk driving here, it's horrifying.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m FSU alumni. First of all, I wouldn\u2019t worry about only being surrounded by people from Dade county. FSU definitely isn\u2019t a commuter school filled with the same people as high school. And believe me, I was also in the, \u2018Get me the hell out of Florida!!!\u2019 crowd. I got told right before entering high school that my dad was packing up the family and moving to Florida because he wasn\u2019t going to shovel snow ever again and I am still upset over that even today.\n\nSecond, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth going out of state to a similar type of big state school. Travel is a pain the further away you go even if you don\u2019t have to pay out of state tuition.\n\nFSU has a very national alumni base. Off the top of my head, I\u2019ve met up with fellow Noles in Chicago, D.C. South Carolina and California and I\u2019m sure it would be higher without 2 years of Covid hurting large gatherings. Here in the financial markets of Chicago, I met FSU alum with Econ or business degrees fairly regularly.\n\nThe Cons (which could also be Pros) are that Tallahassee is a small city and it\u2019s kinda isolated. It doesn\u2019t tend to make the tour schedule of most artists, so you\u2019re likely going to have to travel to see any big shows. Tallahassee weather gives you a taste of the four seasons. Winters can be cold and rainy, not bad at all compared to most of the USA, but not shorts in January weather.\n\nAlso, being isolated means that a lot of internships that aren\u2019t government related will be out of the city. It\u2019s not much of a business or scientific hub.\n\nI know there\u2019s one [FSU YouTuber](https://youtube.com/@ashtonherndon) You can get a lot of information about FSU on his channel.",

I got slammed with an extra 3k in bills last spring because they lied about whether I'd owe the university money for doing mental health drops on two classes, and then AFTER approving not paying out one of my scholarships for a semester, they paid it out anyways and had the audacity to slap me for that and a late fee during spring break. You'll also have to put up with very shitty traffic during game day weekends, a very pushy Toilet Paper USA chapter on Landis, our abysmal parking situation.

I\u2019ve heard great things about London and Valencia, but Florence would probably give you the best experience. The Florence FSU study center is brand new and in an amazing location. The Florence program is run by amazing staff and you will meet amazing people. Based on what I\u2019ve learned from talking to other study abroad students here from other universities, FSU has one of the best and most advanced study abroad programs in Florence. \n\nAgain, this is not really answering your question directly, but I would highly recommend doing the program. If you are out of state, and you do the full year abroad, you get in state tuition for the rest of your time at FSU, as well. Just some food for thought",

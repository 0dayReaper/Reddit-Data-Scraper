Only you and your roommate have access to the bathroom.\n\nDouble with Shared Bath: Two people are assigned to the room and the bathroom is shared with a single, double, or triple room next door (like a \"Jack and Jill\" bathroom). So, up to 5 people share the bathroom, but 4 sharing the bathroom is the most common set up.",

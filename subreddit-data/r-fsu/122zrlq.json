    "postText": "Howdy folks I don\u2019t go to FSU, I go to Ole Miss but I\u2019m also a Florida State fan and I really wanna go to a game in Tallahassee this year. The only problem is, I\u2019d prefer it be a night game. I just think the atmosphere is better at night based on FSU games I\u2019ve watched on TV\n\nI had originally planned to go to the Virginia Tech game since it\u2019s Family Weekend and Family Weekend games are usually always night games, but Ole Miss plays Arkansas that weekend and since I\u2019m in the band I obviously have to be in Oxford for the game.\n\nIf they don\u2019t select me for the Auburn pep band trip, I could go to the Duke game but since it\u2019s homecoming I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll be at night (here at Ole Miss our last two homecoming games against Arkansas and Kentucky were both 11AM games).\n\nThe week before that, there\u2019s also the Syracuse game, which is probably my best bet.\n\nMiami is gonna be a night game probably but I wanna go on the Georgia pep band trip so bad since Ole Miss doesn\u2019t play Georgia every year (Georgia\u2019s Sanford Stadium has a great gameday environment so I\u2019ve heard!) so I won\u2019t be going to the Miami game (but one day I\u2019ll hopefully watch FSU-Miami in Doak).\n\nWhich game(s) do you think will be night games?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/122zrlq)",

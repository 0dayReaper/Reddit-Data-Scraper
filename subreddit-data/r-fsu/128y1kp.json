So if any of y\u2019all are transfers especially from a community college could y\u2019all tell me what it is like to be at FSU now. If so I\u2019d love to hear y\u2019all. \ud83d\ude0a",

            "comment": "I was a junior level transfer student from Tallahassee Community College with an AA. The transition was seamless and amazing, it was slightly intimidating going from 30 person classes to 300 person classes, but you adjust quickly.\n\nPeople were extremely nice and easy to make friends with, I had a whole friend group built in less than a month. I still talk to most of them today, 5 years later.\n\nThe professors are great quality for upper division classes and really support their students, they were always there for extra office hours or whatever else people needed.",

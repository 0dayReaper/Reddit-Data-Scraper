You can read your statement at the meeting, or someone on our team can read it for you (you don't have to attend the meeting to submit a statement, though attendance really helps too!). You can also remain anonymous if you like.\n\nOur bargaining meeting is tomorrow (Friday 9/2) on Zoom at 10:30 am. Like I said, attendance really helps!

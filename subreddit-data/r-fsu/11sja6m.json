Ons job asked me after the interview to submit a writing sample, then a week later asked me for three professional references. I sent the references, and one of mine confirmed that the hiring manager contacted her. Is this a sign I may get the job? It\u2019s been over two weeks and still no offers, losing hope rn bc I reallllly need a job \ud83e\udd79",

I've worked with people who were absolute masters of the bureaucracy and if they had a good candidate, they could be through the process in 2 weeks. That's about the outside quickest, though.",

That took about two weeks from interview to offer, with another two weeks before starting because I gave notice at my previous employer and they were trying to get me on-cycle for payroll.\n\nMy previous position prior to 2013 took about a month from interview-to-start-date. I'm currently in the process again for another position within the university, interviewed two weeks ago and have submitted my references but still waiting for a yay or nay.\n\nIt's stressful, it really is.

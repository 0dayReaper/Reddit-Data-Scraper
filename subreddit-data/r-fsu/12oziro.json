Tally is a little bit different being that it is much bigger and it's the state capital. There's something for everyone in Tally. Probably the same for Clemson but I'm biased bc I graduated from FSU. I was in the same boat stuck between Clemson and FSU and I chose FSU bc of in-state tuition. I don't regret it at all. I miss it every day.",

Even as a premed if you don\u2019t get into med school with a bio degree you\u2019re pretty much stuck but if you have an engineering degree you can almost make 6 figures right out of college.",

If you are borrowing at all then go the cheapest and go as fast as you can.  I hate to say grow up fast but every additional dollar you borrow will chase you.",

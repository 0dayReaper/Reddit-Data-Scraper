    "postText": "Hi, I was recently admitted into FSU class of 27! I\u2019m very excited and thankful, but I checked my honors program application and I didn't get into the honors program. Some of my friends said this was odd since I received the Vires scholarship for academic rigor (12k total), so I was wondering if this is unusual or if I may have made a mistake by applying as Undecided on my major? Also, I was wondering if anyone has any advice for getting into the honors program in the future or if its not worth it to apply if you didn\u2019t get in the first time? Thank you very much!",

As for your preceding question, I wouldn\u2019t be too worried about honors, they inflated their pool last year and it\u2019s caused many logistical issues with honors courses. Stay consistent and motivated with honors and maybe join some academically challenging programs (like UROP) to ensure honors will be in your grasp. First semester without honors won\u2019t impact you too much.\n\nHope this helps! Congrats on getting into FSU hope to see you here soon :)",

    "postText": "I'm a 2nd year Biochemistry major and I'm thinking of adding a STEM Entrepreneurship minor, does anyone who has that minor or is an Entrepreneurship major have any insight on how the classes are, whether it's a good idea or not etc? I'm premed so I figured it would be nice to be exposed to some different coursework. I'm going to be going into Biochem 2 this fall so I will have room in my schedule for the classes, any thoughts are helpful tbh :)",

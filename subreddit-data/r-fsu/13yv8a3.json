    "postText": "My mom is a huge gators fan so I only really have gators shirts. I recently stopped by the bookstore and the garnet and gold store when in town for orientation but everything was more pricey than what I\u2019m comfortable with. Is there anywhere else that I could get some shirts for cheaper?\n\nI\u2019m an artist as well so I was wondering if I\u2019d be able to just make my own shirts as long as I don\u2019t sell them. I\u2019m also planning on painting my some of my pockets on my jeans with fabric paint. But overall it\u2019d be nice to have something to wear to games \n\nHere\u2019s one of the designs I made for reference as well",

            "comment": "Hi! First and foremost I LOVE your design. Secondly, it gets really expensive on campus and around college town. Finding cheap branded clothes is really hard. My best advice would be to look for attire on third party websites like Etsy, Pinterest, or Amazon. The bookstores also offer sales on older designs or if you join some organizations they can also provide discounts! Every Wednesday there is \u201cmarket Wednesday\u201d and there are plenty of local students and residents that sell FSU attire and more. \n\nNevertheless, I find cute game day wear on Etsy!",

They are always getting new stuff in so go weekly. Some days a find something FSU and other days I don\u2019t . Most shirts are between $3 and $6. Happy hunting.",

They usually have quite a bit on clearance at the governor's square location. \n\nAs for printing your own... if you aren't selling (craft show/etsy etc) and just making for family it's probably technically a no no (lol) but nobody's gonna stop you or get you.\n\nEdited to add... believe it or not as it gets closer to the season, Walmart gets some super cute stuff in and very reasonable.",

I routinely pick them up for $7-$15 each. Just look then over real good in the photos. I've only had one show up not sized as described, and really it was more short than wide. But most of the time, expensive shirts can be cheap and worth it.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m an engineering major at FSU considering my schedule for fall 23\u2019. I\u2019ve noticed for physics A there\u2019s an option for a studio class which meets less often. I understand that these are a bit more rigorously hands on with reading and so forth, but what interests me is if you need to take a separate lab or not to get a lab credit. Is there anyone who has taken this style of class who can let me know? Also, feel free to share any other opinions about studio physics. Cheers.",

It\u2019s more of a \u201cdiscover physics on your own\u201d type deal. It works fine if you already have some sort of background in physics.",

Also, I felt like I kinda had to teach myself everything in physics anyways so personally I feel like studio was a better use of my time for lack of a better word.",

It can be difficult if you have no experience in physics. Those who did take physics tend to do better.\nEDIT: If you have trouble learning on your own it can be very challenging.",

Hated it. \n\n\nJust some insight, but he writes a few equations on the projector in the first 5-10 minutes of class and then the other 2 hours and 50 minutes are dedicated to solving problems in groups. If your group is just as clueless as you are then it\u2019s even worse.",

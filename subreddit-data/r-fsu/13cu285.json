    "postText": "Hello, guys \n\nI recently made a major change from Special Ed to IT. I have taken the basic pre-recs for IT and passed them with B's. My question is where do you go on from here? I don't know where to start right now and I am graduating next year in Spring. For those in IT, I am too far behind? And if so, can you offer some advice?",

            "comment": "The IT degree is not necessarily hands on tech heavy. You get a little bit of everything, only a couple advanced classes if you actually choose to do them. Don't absolutely focus on going into a help desk after this degree alone. If you plan on going the IT Room/Networking/SysAdmin route, you'll also want certs: A+, Net+, Security, Linux, etc, lots of certs to advance, and honestly, you don't need a degree to do it unless you want to maybe be a Director of IT or Security at a major institution. This degree will lead you more towards consulting, auditing, client relations type IT jobs in all honesty. The people in my BS that went into hands on heavy tech usually had a CS or Engineering minor and would get involved in those. We had people go to Deloitte, GM, Citibank, Align, etc., Large companies doing more than fixing emails or installing Office. \n\nOn top of that, join the clubs offered at CCI. Talk to Ebe Randeree about what's available. The singer you're involved the better. Build that resume now, and keep adding to it as you go along. Build a website that is your resume you can update, LinkedIn, go to the clubs events with first speakers and campus recruiters. Get involved in your college community as an officer of a club, it shows you did more that just get good grades. But keep the grades up, if you want to get into Masters or hired by a large company they have GPA requirements. If you can pull it off, do your Masters right away, you'll learn more about management and team work. \n\nGood luck",

If you haven\u2019t already started start studying for CompTIA A+ Security+ Network+ cloud certs. You might need different ones depending on the specific subset of IT you want to go in.  With the summer starting a conservative estimate should you being able to complete A+ and Security+ or it\u2019s equivalents if not more (depending on the relevant certs for what you want to do in IT). A part time IT remote job wouldn\u2019t hurt either.",

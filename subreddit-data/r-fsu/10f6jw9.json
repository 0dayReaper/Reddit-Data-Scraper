Then was hired in what I was told was a relatively quick 3 months. Think it depends on the workload of the college HR (if they have one) and main campus.",

            "comment": "Some may not agree with this but do your own investigation. If you go on LinkedIn and you search the companies that are at the career fairs. Depending on the company it ranges but some companies don\u2019t even have a single FSU alum as having worked there currently. I think some companies recruiting departments are so massive that they attend any and every college event even when they have no prior history of hiring FSU alum on LinkedIn. After making this observation myself I do not go to job booths of companies that don\u2019t have FSU alumni working currently in the company. Not many people talk about it or even notice it. The person who runs the career fairs for fsu is honestly clueless and shouldn\u2019t be allowing companies in who have ZERO track record of hiring FSU students and they shouldn\u2019t be running the event in the first place if they couldn\u2019t even recognize it for themselves",

I would not expect transparency from fsu. If you haven\u2019t heard back by now you probably won\u2019t get an offer unfortunately",

If they get more or someone doesn't accept then the next in line is supposed to be offered the waiver.   How do I know this?  I talked to FSU admissions an hour ago.",

The office explained to me that scholarship offers are simultaneous, which probably you don\u2019t have any info about a scholarship, you didn\u2019t get it. You may have a little of a chance left since it may be handled differently from the traditional scholarship. From the graphic I saw elsewhere, a 31 on ACT was right at the average for admitted students.",

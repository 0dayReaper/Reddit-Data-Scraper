    "postText": "My brother is in college, though graduated with his undergrad degree early and is completing his master's degree, living with and receiving financial support from my family. He's currently under the age of 24 as well. I know FASFA considers him dependent anyways, but he *still* is in college and I wrote that as such on the FASFA under the # of people in the household in college, (two, including me, which I know I'm supposed to include myself).  However, FSU keeps on correcting my FASFA and changing it to one. This has wildly affected my EFC and for the first time ever, I'm not a Pell Grant recipient. I've gone back and corrected my FASFA *back* only for them to re-correct it *again.* I tried to call today, but no one could really help me.\n\nWhat's even weirder is that when FSU gave me my financial aid package a few days ago, I *did* have Pell Grant despite my EFC being, thanks to them, way too high, and then I checked again this morning and they took it away.\n\nThey also took away my Work Study, but I'm going to directly contact the Work Study office about that because they tried to do that to me last semester and I just called them and they fixed it. My boss even was confused as to why they took it away from me, but her hands are tied.\n\nGranted, I transferred to FSU in Spring, but I don't think that still would change anything. I also was selected for verification, but I always am, and none of that has anything to do with my household size I don't believe because they just asked for my parent's tax form + mine. Regardless of that, I always have put him in my household (and my other older brother back when he was in college, too) without any issues. Any tips, or any idea why this happened?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I meant that my brother is independent, sorry! ",

Still so confusing aha, as this hasn't been an issue in the past as this isn't his first year in grad school-- even with me always being selected for verification. In addition, considering that FASFA wants you to report if your parents are in college too, I bet that a sibling in grad school would be fine, too. Thank you, though.",

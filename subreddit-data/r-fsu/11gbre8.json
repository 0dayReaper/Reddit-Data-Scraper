Not expecting it to be super nice like all the ones in college town since its a few miles away from campus but if anyone has any info ab it lmk!",

            "comment": "Never lived at the flats but I live in a complex on high road right now and it\u2019s good. The rent is cheap, two bus lines go through the neighborhood, and it\u2019s typically quiet since it\u2019s far away from the bars and such. There\u2019s a target at the end of the road within walking distance or a few minute drive and then obviously all the fast food on Tennessee. We did have a drive by shooting in the parking lot in October, the area is obviously a little sketchy since it\u2019s cheap housing in Tallahassee but there are fewer drug smells than in other places I\u2019ve lived at/visited in town (last year my downstairs neighbors were smoking actual meth, so I\u2019ll take passing by a hotboxed car once a month in a heartbeat by comparison lmao). Hope this helps you decide about the area at least!",

            "comment": "I can\u2019t speak to how the flats on high would be in particular but from fall 2020-summer 2022 I lived at the Osceola in the 4x4 units and the floor plan was almost identical to the ones at the flats. Honestly when I first moved in I had way too high of expectations at the Osceola and student housing in general, but once I got all of my stuff put into place I became really comfortable with it and ended up really enjoying my time there aside from some issues with management but that could be different for the flats. It was nice because you have your own private entrance into your room with a kitchenette and mini living room essentially so if you really hate your roommates you hardly have to interact with them. Each space with your room is a little small but you get used to it and come to appreciate it in my opinion. My suggestion would be to go visit the flats and speak with their staff and take a tour of the rooms to get a better idea if it\u2019ll be a good fit for you. \n\nI\u2019ve also heard decent things about legacy not sure how much their rent is though.",

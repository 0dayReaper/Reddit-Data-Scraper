I absolutely LOVE Catalina cafe in college town, best coffee in my opinion, and very good homemade syrups! The Frothers Daughter is second for me. It is a coffee trailer, not a caf\u00e9. Find them on Instagram and definitely give it a try. Lucky Goat also has great coffee. Welcome to Florida State!!!",

It\u2019s a grocery store but they have a drink bar at the front that sells coffee and smoothies. The tables do tend to fill up fast but it\u2019s pretty good anyway lol",

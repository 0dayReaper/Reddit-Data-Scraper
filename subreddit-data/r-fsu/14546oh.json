It used to be called Aqua Club and they changed their name because of the horrible reputation.\n\nSeminole Grand is alright. I visited friends there a lot and it was fine, just car break in issues sometimes.",

When I lived there in 2020, the parking lot flooded from what looked like a burst pipe and our cars were tire deep in water. 32304, the zip code there is the second poorest in Florida, so the crime rates are also high. My roommate at the time had her car broken into while living there. Just be careful, and make sure to lock your doors and cars.",

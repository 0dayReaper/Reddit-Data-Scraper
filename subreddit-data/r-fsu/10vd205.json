    "postText": " \n\nHello writers, artists, and creators!\n\nWelcome to The Kudzu Review! The Kudzu is a literary magazine that features the work of undergraduate college students. Although we are based is Tallahassee FL at Florida State University, we accept and encourage submissions from undergrad students anywhere in the world. We are looking for original works of non-fiction, fiction, poetry, or visual art to feature in our publication. Our goal is to provide a place for aspiring writers and artists to showcase their works to a larger audience:)\n\nIf you're interesting in submitting, check out these general guidelines and click [the link](https://kudzureviewfsu.com/) to see the genre specific guidelines, our submission portal, and digital copies of past issues.\n\nWe ONLY accept submissions from current undergraduate students.\n\nUndergraduates who graduated one semester prior to the current submission period may also submit. (I.e., if you graduated in spring, you may submit the following fall, or vice versa.)\n\nWe are an international magazine, so no matter what university you attend in the world, we want to read your work!\n\nIf submitting multiple pieces, please do so individually. Do NOT submit multiple pieces in one file.\n\nWe recommend you make the file name the same as the piece\u2019s title.\n\nDo not include any identifying information within the document itself.\n\nIt is free to submit. While we are a non-paying market, contributors accepted for print publication will receive a complimentary copy of the issue in which they are published.\n\nWe do accept simultaneous submissions, but please notify us immediately if your piece has been accepted for publication elsewhere.\n\nOur editors may suggest a round of edits. Publication is not contingent upon acceptance of these editorial suggestions.\n\nOur early decision deadline for our Spring issue is Feb. 6th and our final submission deadline is Feb 24th.\n\nThanks so much for considering our magazine and we are looking forward to seeing your work :)",

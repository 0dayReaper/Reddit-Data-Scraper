    "postText": "I recently went to use the practice rooms for the first time and I noticed that it was understandably very crowded around the time I went (around 2 pm), I happened to get really lucky and caught someone leaving a room as I arrived so I was able to practice, but I still heard passing conversations on not being able to find a room. The practice rooms are pretty far from my dorm so I'd hate to do all that walking just to have to turn back, so is there any time frame where they're most available? If it's earlier in the morning so be it but I want to make sure",

I am blessed to have parents that can support things like rent for an apartment at fsu.\n\nIf I go to ucf I will be living with my parents (who are very strict and plan to enforce their strictness as long as I am living with them)\nIf I go to fsu I will be living in an apartment payed by them.\n\nI honestly think I will perform better and be happier by myself in an apartment, but I will also be 4 hours away from my family. I know almost nothing about fsu or ucf. Please help or give me suggestions/insight\n\nEdit: thank y\u2019all for the responses!",

Orlando has plenty of concerts, shows, sports, soccer, etc.  There's also lots of career opportunities with all the companies in central Florida.  But seeing how you want to become a dentist, FSU is probably be the better fit since their academic program is likely to be more rigorous and you should go experience the college life without your parents hanging over you.  When you don't have your parents monitoring your every move, it allows you the freedom to figure things out for yourself.",

But as someone who moved from Orlando to Tally a decade ago, it's a great distance if you still want easy access to your family without living WITH your family. The drive (or bus ride, if you don't have a car) is not bad. I'm in my 30s now and still make the drive pretty frequently to see my parents for a day or two at a time. \n\nI think college is a great time to put just a little bit of distance and start developing independence. You get a really balanced option with Tallahassee being less than 4 hours from Orlando.",

UCF is a fantastic university that has a humongous campus with so many amenities and things constantly happening around it plus the city of Orlando (clubs, parks, restaurants) all in one place. FSU is a much smaller community with the home town college atmosphere feel very similar to what you would get from an Auburn, Alabama, and similar schools. Pick the school that fits your needs the best, because if you take your studies seriously and do well, a degree from either will fit you perfectly.",

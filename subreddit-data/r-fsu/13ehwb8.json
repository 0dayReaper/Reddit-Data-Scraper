If it makes you feel any better, I\u2019ve never personally heard of IIT, but that\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean much. It depends on your major, and how that particular college in the university works for students. Ask a new question based on your major about FSU only, go to IIT\u2019s page to ask the same.",

But unless you're willing to pay $900+ for an apartment near campus, they all have something about them. Pick the cheapest and move on tbh. \n\neta: checkout Polo Club on High",

Now I live in college town and it is annoying with all the drunk people and screaming sometimes but I would take that over West Tennessee any day of the week also I feel like a lot of the apartment complexes there a shitty and overprice for what they are.",

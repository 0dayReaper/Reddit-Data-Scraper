I Love math and I want to study a major where I can apply math in the financial world\n\nOptions:\n\n1- Stay with Actuarial science\n\n2- Statistics\n\n3- Applied and Computational Math",

            "comment": "As an actuarial science major, I don't at all think the major is necessary to pass exams. There's an intro to actuarial math class that prepares you for the first exam, which I found very helpful. There's also a class in the department of stats that prepares you for the second exam, but I personally don't know anyone who got much benefit from the class. The actsci department has a few other classes that prepare you for future exams, but you aren't expected to pass those exams until you've entered the workforce.\n\nAs long as you have motivation to study for the exams on your own time (which you'd have to do as an actuary at some point regardless), you'll be fine pursuing some other major, like finance, applied math, etc.\n\nI do also find that it's easy to double major with actuarial science. So many of its class requirements are shared with finance, applied math, and stats, so adding any of those on will only require a few more classes. I have a secondary major in applied math, and I only had to take 3 or so extra classes for it.\n\nSo I guess in summary, my recommendation would be an actsci/finance double major",

Do you like more statistics or algebra type math? The business degrees generally stop at business calculus level. \n\nI don\u2019t think an Actuarial Science major is a dead end, there are plenty of jobs you can apply your skills to. If that\u2019s your only worry, I would say go for it. As another commenter said, you can pair it with a finance masters if you decide to go that direction.\n\n&gt; I love math and I want to study a major where I can apply math in the financial world\n\nThat is actuarial science\n\nAccounting is a lot less math than you think, I would compare it more to law in that you follow Generally Accepted Accounting Principles to apply transactions in different ways. One thing I will note is that I saw you were an international student and FSU focused on teaching U.S. GAAP whereas most of the rest of the world uses IFRS, not a big deal, but if you want to get a job in accounting outside of the U.S. you\u2019re going to have to relearn some things. But accounting gives you a very good basis for business.\n\nI would say Finance has a good amount of algebra to it but just slightly more than accounting (although accounting is generally harder).\n\nThink very generally about what you would like to do in the future (I know it\u2019s hard) but also look at the major course requirements and see if you\u2019d find those interesting. \n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "I double majored in stats and applied econ, and would highly recommend that path. Applied econ gives you some classes in finance/business, so it ends up being a very useful combination.\n\nYou do not need to major in actuarial science to become an actuary.  If you do major in statistics, make sure to at least take Calculus III even though it's not required, and also take STA4321 instead of STA4442. You can pass the introductory exams without Calc III and with STA4442, but you will need to teach yourself double integrals.\n\nIf you do want to go the actuarial path (even if you don't major in actuarial science), I highly recommend: [theinfiniteactuary.com](https://theinfiniteactuary.com) for online courses targeted towards the exam. They are clear and thorough, and will prepare you to destroy the exams if you are diligent. The courses are expensive, but there's a big discount if you're a full time student. I'm not an actuary, but I did pass a couple of exams before ultimately going a different route.\n\nLooking at the major map for actuarial science, it looks like a nice combination of math, statistics, economics, finance, and risk management. I wouldn't think you'd be pigeon holed based on the curriculum, but might be tougher to market yourself outside of jobs that follow the actuarial path.",

After talking to a few insurance companies on I-day, I immediately switched my major because I was bored out of my mind and couldn't be stuck doing that my whole life.\n\n I would recommend sticking to something more broad like applied math and taking the the FM and P actuarial exam classes and passing those exams to have more options.",

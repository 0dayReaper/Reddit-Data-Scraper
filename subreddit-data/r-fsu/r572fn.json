Get back in the car, still barely inching forward\u2026 and she rear ended me again less than 5 min after the first time!!! I know when she tells that story I\u2019m the asshole but maybe you wouldn\u2019t be getting screamed at had you not ran into my car twice! Luckily there wasn\u2019t any damage from the second one either but ma\u2019am put the phone down ffs.",

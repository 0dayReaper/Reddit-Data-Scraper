    "postText": "I am looking to transfer to FSU next Spring from a TX community college. I will finish out this semester with 30 credits and on track to keeping my 4.0 GPA. After the fall semester I will only have 59 credits.. will I still be required to have SAT scores to get accepted? I started college 10 years ago when I graduated HS and only recently went back to continue my education. I did not need to take SAT to get into the community college because I did well on my state tests.\n\nI\u2019d be a CJ major.",

Being such waives SAT/ACT scores and is solely based upon college GPA and the prerequisites being met. Without such, you will need to submit SAT/ACT scores along with \n\nDisclaimer: Keep in mind I am not an admission officer, nor do I work for the University. This advice is based upon my experience and the information that I am aware of. For more information on it I would recommend reaching out to the admissions office.",

If you take one of those exams for a class and pass, you will get all of the credits for that class. There are easy ones that you can take to give you 3 more credits, like sociology. Just study for like 2 weeks and take the exam.",

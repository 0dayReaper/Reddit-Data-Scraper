    "postText": "I was accepted with political science as my major, thinking of being on a pre-law track, but now I'm not as sure after reading some things saying it doesn't really prep for LSAT or law school in general. Also, if I decided not to go into law I don't really know what I would do with a degree in poli sci. I want to pursue law school but am very nervous it will not work out, will be too expensive, or I won't be interested etc. Some other majors I considered were criminology and international affairs. I read about editing, writing, and media as well and thought it would be interesting too since something in publishing would interest me. Also, saw posts saying philosophy would be good for pre-law? \n\nI would possibly like to get a dual degree, or double major, if the dual degree is a lot of courseload/more than bright futures would cover. And if I did do dual/double, I am struggling to see which combo of majors would make the most sense, and prepare for law school, but also allow some fallback for another career. And I'm more so stressing about my major since I have a decent amount of credits from ap and ib, around 36ish, that I'm assuming would require a faster decision. Any recommended majors, advice, experience, info, is appreciated, and please consider I really have no clue how deciding on a major works atp.",

            "comment": "Both of my sons went to law school. One majored in English Lit and said he felt well prepared because law school is 99% reading and writing. Other majored in history and also felt prepared for law school. From what they have both told me, you could major in what ever interests you, as it doesn\u2019t make a difference. As far as LSAT, a prep course is your best bet. If you have good grades and LSAT score (160+), you\u2019re likely to get a full tuition law school scholarship.",

He was telling me last week that the top 2 majors admitted to law school (our law school? Law schools in general? Idk) are Criminology and Political Science. After those two, most other majors are spread pretty evenly. \n\nI have a friend who was a math major and went on to become a criminal defense lawyer. I don't think the major selection matters as much, other than choosing something that interests you and that you are going to be successful in.",

            "comment": "I would avoid law school unless it\u2019s something you have always wanted to do and you get a full tuition scholarship. Otherwise you\u2019ll be grinding for 3 years while incurring a mountain of debt with misleading job prospects, and you still have to pass the bar. Many law jobs are low paying jobs, then coupled with high debt is not good. I just really suggest researching the ABA and actual jobs in law and the relative pay scales. Poli Sci could be useful if you want to work in government or alongside government in maybe a lobbying capacity. Maybe look to see if you want go down the criminology route and work in law enforcement. You don\u2019t have to be sworn either, you can do analytical work. Take a semester or so to research the different majors you are interested in and see what really interests you, and if you go the grad school route whether with Law or a Masters/PhD just really try to avoid grad level debt.",

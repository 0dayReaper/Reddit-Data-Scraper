STA 2122 is on the bottom if you can\u2019t see it. The class I\u2019m most worried about it STA2122 because I don\u2019t like math and this will also be the first College level math class I am taking",

It's much, much easier than algebra/calc sequence maths imo. \n\nI don't typically comment on \"rate my schedule\" type posts but your days are gonna be real long. My full time job has a shorter day than your Wednesday. That isn't to say don't do it, but have a plan for your downtime. Get into the habit of doing a little homework, bringing some lunch, and taking a break to socialize or do something entertaining to break up the day.",

Another suggestion would be to move maybe one of those classes to T Th bc having four in one day isn\u2019t very fun in college. but again, all of those things up to preference",

But from personal experience, the best way to make a schedule is to try and not have more then 3 classes in one day (if possible), start at the earliest 9:20 or 10:40, end at the latest 4:20, and if you do have three, don\u2019t have them all back to back to back. give yourself at least one class slot break to just eat or something. I hope that makes sense lol",

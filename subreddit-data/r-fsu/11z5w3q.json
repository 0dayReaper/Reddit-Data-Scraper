MadSo,Township, Coosh\u2019s, and Tim Lizzy\u2019s are all awesome depending on what you\u2019re craving. \n\nWarhorse makes affordable and good drinks, plus is connected to Gaines St Pies if you want to eat pizza too. Oyster City Brewing Company is also right there if you like local craft beers! \n\nIf you don\u2019t mind a pricier drink, Midtown is fun. Waterworks is a cool tiki bar and OverUnder has both a rooftop area and inside bar as well.",

It\u2019s almost always a lively atmosphere too. \n\nThat said, I much prefer the wilbury to any other bar in collegetown, but it\u2019s really just up to you if you like the environment in there.",

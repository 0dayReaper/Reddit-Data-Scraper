    "postText": "I\u2019m a current student at a community college in South Florida and plan to attend FSU for the fall semester of 2024 as a social science education major. I do fairly well in my classes but I do fear that the difficulty in work and class instruction will be very different from what I am use to. If anyone has transferred from a community college to FSU, can you tell me wether or not you experienced a huge difference in word difficulty from classes? I hope to hear from y\u2019all as I am very worried.",

(Finished CC with a 2.5, my FSU GPA is a 3.8) I\u2019ve chalked it up to starting my major and finally being interested in my courses, and maybe having 2 years to develop good habits?? Maturing over 4 years?? In addition, I was at TCC where many of my professors ALSO taught at FSU. As other mentioned, getting the life/school balance can be tricky for some, but it\u2019s not something to worry about!! Community college has helped prepare you, and you\u2019ll adjust in no time. Enjoy it \ud83d\udc4d",

Ended up double majoring at FSU in PoliSci and Art History. Had a great experience at both the CC and university levels. \n\nI think it helped that I established relationships with professors, engaged in extracurriculars, and acknowledged that I had to put in more work than my peers sometimes to get the same results. Don\u2019t be discouraged by setbacks and keep on swimming.",

Once at FSU, I almost had a 4.0 except for one B+ my last semester, same with the Masters. But, big but, I was highly interested in my major, and was kinda familiar with a few things previously from my own free time research and reading up on things. So ymmv, if you're here to learn and pass classes and are interested in what you want as a career that you're going to school for, you'll be fine. Just work at it, but don't forget to enjoy the clubs and extracurricular events that you don't really get at the CC. Good luck.",

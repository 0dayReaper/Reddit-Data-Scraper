    "postText": "Hey! I'm a psychology/neuro double major and I'm beginning this fall at FSU (coming in with an AA) and I was beginning to map out my schedule as I'm looking to knock out both psych and med school reqs (similar to neuro) without having an overloaded schedule. \n\nfor the moment I came up with the following classes: \n\nbsc 2010 + lab\n\ndep 3103\n\nSta 2122\n\npsb 2000\n\nPSY 2023\n\nI'm not entirely sure if the schedule is too heavy, I believe it is because I know labs are they're own classes as well, but I know because three of the classes are psychology/neuro classes I had similarly taken before that they might not be as hefty. Though I'm not 100%",

That\u2019s an extremely doable, verging on easy, schedule.\n\nThe lab is annoying because the TA\u2019s teaching it generally don\u2019t have the slightest clue how to teach and are brand new PhD students themselves, but other than that it\u2019s smooth sailing.",

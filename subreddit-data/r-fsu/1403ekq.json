Most places I've looked into have 1 year long leases, but I don't want to have to keep paying for a place I'm not living in or deal with the hassle of finding someone to sublease it out to. Does anyone here know of apartments that do ~6 month leases or something like that?",

Something along the lines of 90% of two months rent and you can cancel your lease. I know that is not cheap but it is better than paying another 6-7 months of rent on a room you don't need. I think it was installed during Covid.",

    "postText": "(long read, sorry\ud83d\ude41) \n\nHey guys. For the longest time ever, I thought that I\u2019d be 100% committing to UCSD. After getting waitlisted by all my dream/top schools, UCSD was my only option. Today I toured it and liked it too, was about to commit, until I saw an email from FSU. \n\nInitially, I was placed into rolling admissions by FSU because I didn\u2019t submit my SAT score on time. I thought that I\u2019d 100% get rejected as my score isn\u2019t even in their range, but they offered me the \u201cseminole pathway program\u201d. Basically, if I do my freshman year studying abroad and maintain a 3.0 GPA, I\u2019ll be guaranteed admission to FSU with an out-of-state tuition waiver. Even though I\u2019m a Cali resident, the approx. cost of FSU undergrad NOT INCLUDING AID/SCHOLARSHIPS ($97,668) will be less than my in-state UCSD financial aid offer with aid/scholarships ($110,640). I\u2019m really lost and don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ll list the pros and cons of each, so please help me decide. If anyone has any experience with these unis please share too! \n\nUCSD pros: \nclose to the beach \ntwo hours away from home\n#34 nationally\nAMAZING pre-med opportunities \nmany of my friends are going \ni have like 5 community college courses that will 100% transfer to UCSD\n\nUCSD cons:\nmore money\n\u201csocially dead\u201d\nquarter system\nweird ass college system\nugly\nmany people from my high school are attending (i want a fresh start)\n\nUCSD General Facts:\n34% acceptance rate\nIn a great city but the school itself is boring\nNeurobiology major\n\nFSU Pros: \ncheaper\n\u201cmedical honors program\u201d a bs/md 7 year program I can apply to sophomore year\nwill get to study abroad in spain (heard great things abt the program and i love spain) \nclose-knit study abroad community\nsemester system \ngreat campus\n\nFSU Cons:\nwill miss the \u201cfreshman experience\u201d \nharder to acclimate back after freshman year\nneed to maintain a 3.0 (easy but yk) \nno beach (im from la so saddening) \nfar from home\n\nFSU General Facts: \n32% acceptance rate \nfun school but boring city\nPsychology major\n\nBoth FSU and UCSD are in the top 75 pre-med schools. I don\u2019t know which one of them will give me the best shot at med school while having a great undergrad experience. I know I want to 100% study abroad sometime during undergrad, and I\u2019m not opposed to it being freshman year but please I need your advice. I don\u2019t know what to do. They said that they need a decision by April 12th (FOUR DAYS\u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f) and I\u2019m just so lost and confused and god I wish I only had one option.",

I like SD over Tallahassee but I mean they\u2019re very different places. I think if you grew up in CA FSU might be a nice change of pace and if you want to go into medicine you will probably perform better than your peers at FSU. CA has a better education system and I\u2019m assuming that since you got into a UC you have decent grades. Both are great but if you want a more \u201ctraditional\u201d college experience FSU is the way to go. Also everything is cheaper in FL (housing, food, electricity, etc.).",

FSU has a more tempting party scene, if you're likely to fall into that, it will suck your life away. Med school is very competitive, gotta stay on top. Plenty of folks have done study abroad and integrated back in fine afterwards. \n\n\nAlso FL beaches are lil nicer than CA. You can actually go in the water and not be freezing.",

As someone who dropped out junior year then picked back up eight years later, I wouldn't be too concerned about missing out on much if you aren't on campus for your first year. I actually lived in off campus dorms my freshman year and if I missed out on some experience I don't know that I did.\n\nYou said you're looking for a fresh start, I initially came to Tallahassee to get away for something new. It will give you that. I will say that being that away from my family was rough, especially when some friends could and would go home every other weekend. \n\nFlip a coin and see what school is the result. If you're not happy with the result, there's your definitive answer. Either way, this will be a life changing decision, but we all have those every day and hardly ever see the results or think about what ifs. \n\nBest of luck!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m an FSU undergrad alum and about to graduate from business school at UCLA (I know, not UCSD, but still a UC). I honestly can\u2019t state highly enough to go to undergrad a cheap as possible and do the big stuff for grad/professional school. Graduating with little to no debt will give you options and flexibility after.  While it sounds like you\u2019ll be abroad for Freshman year (which I know doesn\u2019t sound too appealing right now but you\u2019ll be so thankful for the experience 10 years from now when you can\u2019t travel much, trust me), you\u2019ll eventually get the college experience. Also, my sister did pre-med at FSU and had a great experience (I went to the film school so I had a very atypical college experience). She got to travel abroad twice for it and was challenged and got into med school after. \n\nOn the surface, Tallahassee seems small and boring but you\u2019ll end up loving the simplicity if you end up in a big city later on. Lots of nature close by for an afternoon or Saturday. Best beaches in the country two hours South. Bonus, it\u2019ll be cheaper to go out in Tallahassee than it is in SD. SD is my favorite city in California, but you can always end up there later on.",

She is very happy with her choice but she far away and it takes 2 flights to get home or for us to visit her. The quarter system @ UCSD is brutal. \nFSU  is known for Greek life and Football is a BIG deal. Large party scene.\nOne thing to consider if you go to FSU . Your breaks will be different from your friends and family in CA. School finishes end of April and goes back in early Aug versus ending Mid June and starting mid Sept.",

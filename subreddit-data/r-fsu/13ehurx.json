            "comment": "I recently graduated with MIS. Most of the classes are industry standard, information system lifecycles, SQL. It allows you to get a high level overview of a normally technical field and apply business tactics to it. I took business analytics as a minor and did most of my electives in that. I think it pairs greatly with MIS as you get a little more technical on the data side. I\u2019ve seen people double major in accounting/MIS, finance/MIS, or take a minor in CS.",

I hear the work gets very repetitive. Ask yourself, are you more techie or business? If the former, take CS. If the latter, do Business Management.",

Which one to choose?\n\nAlso I heard from seniors we can take electives from other courses. Like stuyding in MIS and take electives from CS program.? So in that sense what you\u2019ll suggest?",

If you want to learn not only program but more software development and algorithms, I\u2019d recommend doing CS. If you want to do both CS and business, I\u2019d recommend doing the BA track for CS, as that will allow you to minor in something like business management. You\u2019ll get the STEM background plus a business one.",

What is the best major for that?",

That way you\u2019ll have the hard science and math for the business world. I don\u2019t know much about the business analytics or entrepreneurship programs here, but frankly you could learn that on your own",

    "postText": "so i was accepted into summer 2023, and while filling out housing information and such, i realized i dont really understand how this all works (lol). what happens after the summer semester is up? do i just end up signing up for fall classes once im there? \n\ni realized while reading the summer housing contract, since they say to apply for fall/spring housing first since those spots fill up a lot faster. but will i be in classes during the fall and spring? does that just depend on what i sign up for?\n\nim pretty much figuring out everything about college by myself, so even general information gets me in a better spot than clueless. any help is very appreciated!",

Especially if you don't have a sibling or a close friend who's recently done all this, nothing makes any sense at first and most people are just pretending their way through their first steps. Never feel bad for asking!\n\nMost students enroll in 4-5 classes (12-15 credit hours) every Fall and Spring semester, and maybe a couple classes during the Summer. That's how you stay on track to graduate in 4 years. \n\nBecause you are a new freshman admit, you'll register for your first Summer and Fall semester during orientation, but usually registration for those terms runs from March to May. Spring registration doesn't start until usually October, but you will meet with an advisor during your Fall semester to plan your Spring classes. And so on and so forth moving forward.",

If you are admitted to the summer, you automatically progress into the Fall - it's not a separate admission consideration. At orientation, you will register for classes for both your summer and fall semesters. Then for spring, you will wait until course registration opens for that term (in October), but again, it's not separate admission, it's just actually adding the classes to your account.\n\nDoes that make sense?",

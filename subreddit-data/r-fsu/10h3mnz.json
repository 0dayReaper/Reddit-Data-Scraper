How is the statistics major at FSU regarding job prospects, internships, and education? I was planning to either double major/minor in computer science or computational science to go with it. Anyone here who is majoring in or has majored in statistics? Can you tell me about it?",

            "comment": "I am a current grad student in the statistics department who graduated from FSU with a double major in statistics and economics. In my opinion the biggest downside to the program is that there is a large focus on SAS (you can earn a SAS certificate if you want by submitting a portfolio). While the language is still used in some industries (insurance, pharmaceuticals, government, etc.), a lot of companies are moving to open source languages such as R and Python. There are some courses that use these languages, but they are not as common. In terms of teachers I have never had an issue with any of them, however I did a lot of undergrad remote due to Covid so that definitely influenced my perception. However, some of the introductory courses will be taught by graduate students who may or may not be great at teaching, and most of the courses will have a TA who does the grading and will hold office hours to help (I am one of them) if you don\u2019t want to go to the professor directly. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing something, so feel free to ask any questions if you have them.",

Also being a SAS programmer and pyhon programmer - SAS is not just a language but a giant library of working on data sets.  Python is just an interpreted language.   Learn both (lots of ez python classes tho)",

I am in the Applied Statistics with an Emphasis on Data Science program, but there is also an interdisciplinary masters in Data Science that the department of computer science, statistics, and mathematics have teamed up to create. I would have to say that it is definitely helpful to go to graduate school if you want a high paying job, but I would say that internships play a much larger role. There are a LOT of internship opportunities for statistics students, and they often lead to job offers (contingent on graduating). Additionally, you will be able to get a data analyst position within the state government with only a bachelors degree, and while this is not going to be a high paying job it does have good benefits and is often safer than working in the private sector. I will say that going to grad school will give you the opportunity to broaden your skill set since there will be electives that you will want to take, but may not have time to. I forgot to mention this in my first reply, but I\u2019m undergrad you are required to have a minor (or double major), but the prerequisites for the program will get you an automatic math minor.",

You will then know forsure if you need grad school, in what concentration, and what for exactly. You will have much more focus in your grad program because you will know exactly what it is you need to learn and you wont waste time about it. I am currently doing my MS in Financial Mathematics here at FSU and there is a clear distinction in those who came from industry and those that came fresh from undergrad.",

    "postText": "Greetings everybody! I\u2019m a prospective transfer student that has applied to the B.S. in Computer Science program at FSU for Fall \u201823 coming from an in-state college with an Associate\u2019s in Engineering; as such I\u2019m coming in with credits for MAC2313 and MAP2302, and hoping that FSU can be a place that allows me to continue pure math studies at a higher level either as electives or to satisfy the requirements for an additional BS in Mathematics.\n\nI am hoping to get insight from anyone who is pursuing studies in both CS and Mathematics who can tell me about some of the more nuanced details I\u2019ve come across in my investigation into departmental requirements and policies, maybe some of their own personal experience/tips. \n\nOf the things I noticed that I have questions on:\n\n1.  MGF3301 is apparently closed to students who have credit for MAD2104 according to the undergraduate bulletin page for (Pure) Mathematics. Given the department requiring it for the BS in Mathematics and to enroll in MAA4226, would it be advisable for someone needing both courses to fulfill requirements for each respective degree that they complete either MGF3301 first and then MAD2104, or just take them at the same time the first semester to round out their schedule?\n\n2. I recently got a chance to glance around the Love Building and noticed quite a few of the classrooms on the 1st floor were outfitted with desks that looked rather \u201cconfining\u201d or better suited for someone of smaller stature than myself. Would you say that, despite my first impression, accessibility for larger people isn\u2019t necessarily an issue? The idea of feeling cramped in a desk in a Mathematical Analysis course sounds like a nightmare\u2026\n\n3. Is the general environment of each department fairly friendly? Like most people, I think it\u2019s important that people conduct their studies in an inclusive environment where people are respectful to one another. I would say I\u2019m a fairly reserved/shy student but realize upper level courses are a good place to network with people who have similar interests and drive.\n\nIf you made it this far, you have my utmost thanks. Assuming I do find myself back in the Love Building as an FSU student, I look forward to hopefully befriending some of you!",

Few students take both. Math majors will be steered toward MGF3301.",

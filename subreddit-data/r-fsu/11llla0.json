    "postText": "I\u2019m planning to live on campus in an apartment-style dorm and eat lunches, at least, at the dining halls. Right now I\u2019m planning to meal prep dinners, but I know myself well enough to know I probably won\u2019t manage it every week. Is there a meal plan that would allow flexibility for that without risking having a bunch of leftover swipes? I could just not get one, but $10.10 a meal is a lot to pay for someone who can\u2019t (long story, I walk with canes) carry out food for later.",

Iirc it was cheaper per swipe with the meal plan and you can use those swiped 1x a day at retail locations for like $6. You can get a plan with few swipes and add dining dollars or I\u2019d recommend FSU cash so you can use it on laundry and printing as well unless seminole dining runs a special on buying dining dollars. However, if you see yourself almost never going to the dining hall and honestly I don\u2019t blame you it\u2019s only okay at best then dining dollars/fsu cash are the way.",

They have special meal plans for assistantship holders that are 20 or 50 meals per purchase and they don't expire.  It looks like it is 6 dollars a meal to do that or you there is also an option to pay 20 or 40 dollars extra to have cash equivalency.  When you exhaust the 20 or 50 meals just add more meals.  You would need to provide them with some employment information as its a special type of meal plan.

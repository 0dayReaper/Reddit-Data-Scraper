    "postText": "Please for the love of God either have some sympathy or put in the same time and effort you would during any other year. I will more than likely take a semester off next semester because I have never seen FSU professors so disinterested, uncaring, and unkind. If this isn't you, then that's great.\n\nThe 200 people class average on an exam was 60% and of course, that was the classes' fault, no curve. Despite the class being 2 hour lectures with zero substance and just slides reused year after year with no care.\n\nMy supposed to be in person classes have gone from an online lecture to \"here's some videos I made 15 years ago.\" One of those classes has my professors wife moving around and vacuuming in almost every single video with a completely monotone voice.\n\nI get it, it's hard right now but you have a job to do too. If we're expected to sit here and learn in a harder format than usually, then you should be expected to teach in a more engaging and interactive way than usual, even if it's challenging.\n\nI'm sorry if this came off harsh, I do have respect for my professors but right now everything is going against all of us and it feels like nothing is being done to help people who are struggling or have issues focusing and it's honestly one of the saddest things I've seen out of a major R1 university.\n\nPlease, just be kind and help, and teach next semester, even if it involves awkwardly setting up your computer in your living room, that's what we all do to watch lectures anyways.\n\nI put this here because course evals don't mean anything, they're usually hastilly filled out and don't give any accurate reflection on the course.\n\nEdit: sorry my grammar and writing is shit, I'm exhausted and trying to study. \n\nIf you don't want to hear it from a student hear it from a professor at EMU\nhttp://stevendkrause.com/2020/04/06/no-one-should-fail-a-class-because-of-a-fucking-pandemic/",

It would have been nice to hear my name at least being called out during that bullshit online graduation but not even that. I just had to see my name on a slide along with thousands of others.

I\u2019ve been told by professors (as have many of my peers) that we spend too much time on teaching. We\u2019re literally told to spend as little time on teaching as possible so that we can work on our research; if we tell our advisors that we\u2019re focusing on teaching instead of research, then we\u2019re likely to lose both social and financial support for that aspect of our work, and it\u2019s research output that determines our ability to get jobs after graduation. For faculty, tenure is based on research output and your ability to secure grant funding. Teaching isn\u2019t really on the radar. The R1 structure actively disincentivizes putting effort into teaching.....research output is much more heavily weighted. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it *should* be this way (it most definitely shouldn\u2019t). And I\u2019m not saying that all FSU instructors stick classes on the back burner. However, teaching is not your instructors\u2019 main priority, and many instructors who prioritize teaching more highly are doing so at their own peril. That\u2019s a major issue here, and a big part of the reason that some of these classes have been such garbage quality. \n\nAdd to that that (1) your instructors are being forced to entirely restructure their classes to a new format they likely have no previous training or experience in, 2) reported cheating issues have increased by more than 30% this semester alone, which makes for *a lot* more work on your instructor\u2019s part, and (3) instructors now have to individually manage exceptions and deadlines for dramatically more undergrad students due to the myriad issues impacting students right now (e.g., the new format, slumping economy, worsening mental health outcomes, lack of consistent internet access, housing/food insecurity, COVID). Even the instructors who give a damn are struggling because these factors have made teaching more time- and labor-intensive. And remember: your instructors are *also* dealing with the pandemic in their own personal lives. They are also getting sick, losing family members, suffering from worsening mental health, and in many grad students\u2019 cases, dealing with food and housing insecurity. It\u2019s a shitshow all around. \n\nThis is in no way intended to minimize your concerns as students. Your concerns are valid. I just thought that a peek behind the curtain would help to clarify how/why we\u2019re in this mess.",

                    "comment": "Yeah, I just wish that the university and more professors pushed for a more fair and honest way of examining during a pandemic. While we're online it's really difficult and weird to just test memorization via multiple choice or just basic questions, it doesn't really take into consideration what research has found with how people perform in online situations. Cheating is honestly probably up way more than 30%, I see people openly talk about cheating in group chats and I've never seen that before.\n\nI'm just annoyed at the fact that some professors are being super hard on deadlines and it feels lame that a lot of my classes that were previously supposed to be synchronous are now asynchronous because I find it reallt difficult to learn during lectures like that (I don't know why, but other students share my concerns). Professor Brady is an example of a really well put together online class though.\n\nA lot of my synchronous classes have gone asynchronous and atleast with the way my sample size of 2 has sent out emails, they think that their time in the class that doesn't exist anymore from showing up to lectures and teaching is gone for us as well and our schedules are more open, they're not. Just because there's a 5 minute long video instead of a 50 minute long lecture doesn't mean that we don't have to spend 50 minutes to understand it because a rushed video taught us nothing.\n\nIt's things like that that really piss me off. Like there are ways to get through this and seeing friends at other R1 universities, this hasn't been there experience. But this has been an experience shared by friends and peers here.\n\nI know we've all been going through a lot, but I feel like to hold expectations for us the same throughout this is ignorant and would expect students to hold that specific professor to the same level that they usually perform at just in teaching. \n\nI'm not sure if you can see where I'm getting at, and I know it's not all, I know that there are professors bustinf their ass for this but I just feel unlistened to as someone who shows up to class, watches all my lectures and is trying to work, etc. Thanks for listening though.",

                            "comment": "I can certainly see why this would be frustrating. It wasn\u2019t so long ago that I was an undergrad, and I didn\u2019t have a pandemic to deal with. There are several reasons an instructor might be a stickler about a deadline in a time like this (and admittedly, not all of them are good reasons). One obvious one is that it\u2019s just easier that way; ease shouldn\u2019t be the primary motivator for declining deadline adjustments, but allowing any and all requested deadline adjustment would take away from the overall quality of the course because a lot of time that would otherwise go toward the class as a whole must then be diverted to crafting specific adjusted assignment plans for students needing extensions and responding to their emails. Being flexible with one student means you have to be willing to offer the same flexibility to every student with similar circumstances, and keeping track of tons of personalized deadlines with idiosyncratic differences in the leniency provided based on circumstances can be challenging, to say the least. For example, in my class of 220, I had ~12 students who needed personalized deadlines for their exams, and making a call as to who gets additional extensions on top of that (because some students *will* ask for that) gets tricky when I have to try to keep all 12 students personal circumstances straight on top of running my normal class. That also means that many of those students will want to meet one-on-one outside of office hours, which also takes time. \n\nAnother reason some instructors are hesitant to be lenient is because they want to maintain the rigor of the course. For some, this is a matter of ego (e.g., \u201cMY CLASS will remain appropriately rigorous, by gum!\u201d). For others, it\u2019s a matter of scale; they want to make sure that your degree means something when you graduate, and they\u2019re worried that that won\u2019t be the case if they\u2019re so lenient that they\u2019re basically handing out A\u2019s like candy on Halloween. \n\nAnother reason: fairness. I shouldn\u2019t give out an extension to any single person that I wouldn\u2019t be willing to give to everyone else with the same set of circumstances, and sometimes that\u2019s just not possible. As instructors, we have to make sure that we\u2019re not inadvertently being unfair to the rest of the class by offering extensions to one or a few students. \n\nUltimately, instructors are trying to strike a balance between maintaining academic rigor and fairness on the one hand, and making sure that they\u2019re accommodating the students who need it on the other. It\u2019s a tough balancing act in a normal semester, but doubly so right now. Some instructors are better at handling it than others. And yes, some instructors put more effort into handling it than others. I am sorry that you\u2019ve had instructors who\u2019ve practiced this consideration poorly or not at all. There are ways of handling this by building flexibility into your class structure; that\u2019s partially why instructors opt for asynchronous teaching. As it happens, I have a good friend whose Master\u2019s in Education focused on higher education admin and student engagement, and I chose an asynchronous course format because she informed me that, empirically, students perform better in asynchronous online courses than synchronous online courses. It gives students with busy or unstable schedules the flexibility that they need to cover the material in their own time. Of course, this method has its drawbacks, not the least of which is that asynchronous classes have less structure and can therefore be easier to put off or fall behind in. Personally, I set up a super flexible deadline schedule this semester to try to preemptively accommodate the inevitable tumult in students\u2019 lives, but unfortunately, sometimes that\u2019s still not enough. \n\nI should note here: if you\u2019re dealing with extraordinary circumstances, like consistent health problems, food or housing insecurity, or something else of this variety, then contact Case Management (https://dsst.fsu.edu/cms). They can help connect you with the resources you need to get by, but they will also send an official email to your instructors letting them know that you need additional flexibility and consideration. This can go a long way in getting the additional help you need from instructors. I\u2019ve had to refer a lot of students to their office this semester, but then again, I have more students than usual this semester who are homeless or financially supporting their entire families in the wake of the virus. These are strange and unfortunate times.",

Rather, I meant that specific class was kind of a let-down. The Crim department is surprisingly low-demand in terms of budget, yet it generates a ton of revenue through the research it produces (albeit through questionable methods at times). I think part of the reason the Crim dept classes are so dry is because there is no reason to change its method of teaching. Crim is a branch of sociology, and it's hard to demonstrate those theories practically like CS or another hard STEM major can--this isn't to say Crim isn't difficult, but that it's considered a soft science instead of a hard science because of its reliance on indirect measurement. So, I get \\*why\\* their classes are like that, but it doesn't make it entertaining by any means.\n\nSurprisingly, my favorite Crim classes were taught by people who practiced in the field. Will Doerner's (a former Police chief) Police Methods class and Krista Flannigan's (a former state prosecutor) Courts class both stand out to me as some of my favorites.",

This pandemic is actually exposing a big problem that our student body doesn\u2019t have proper expectations for college or the skills to pull it off, making it even more difficult for us as instructors. \n\nThe thing that kills me right now is that students are screaming, \u201cteach me better!\u201d But honestly look back last year. How many students blow off work and just cram the week or night before? So many! So let\u2019s drop the \u201cI\u2019m here to learn and FSU professors won\u2019t step up and teach well.\u201d \n\nAlmost every professor I know is busting ass trying to adapt and it\u2019s fucking hard for us too. Critique professors that aren\u2019t but if you try and lump us all together don\u2019t be surprised if you get lumped in with every other bonehead student out there.\n\nAnd one last thing, drop the \u201cfull tuition injustice\u201d bit. FSU isn\u2019t making a profit off your tuition. It employs real people with real families. If they cut tuition rate for these semesters, that would mean staff getting laid off, less instructors, and bigger classes - all of which would make your experience in and out of the classroom worse. Tuition costs are a real problem in this country but you should be talking to your government to fix that. \n\nDownvote me all night. I truly don\u2019t give a fuck. I\u2019m shooting real truth here. Students need to take responsibility for their education and having a bad experience with this pandemic is universal.",

I have seen previously synchronous classes switch to asynchronous. If professors want to change the whole style of the class after the semester starts, then we need to be given a way to drop the class with no impact to our scholarships. I know it's not like highschool, I knew when I decided to go to an R1 school that I would be experiencing less care from professors than I otherwise would be at a school like Stetson or even TCC. But the bar is so low right now, you guys are acting like you expect the same fucking work right now and it's mind boggling and idiotic and goes against any piece of pedagogy for online teaching. Maybe it's not \"we're suffering so students must have to as well\", maybe it's a \"let's create an easier environment for everyone.\" Or maybe, use your job to make it easier for someone having the same shitty time as you, just don't sit here and say it's the same shit with a covid facade. I have spent more time doing school than any other semester, rarely get to leave my house (My girlfriend and I have asthma and other things that could complicate our time with covid).\n\nI have worked my ass off this semester but feel like there is no consideration to how online teaching is supposed to be done (I was an education based major coming in to FSU).\n\nThe thing is, is you are the people in the position to change this shit and make this pandemic better for everyone. But instead it's a \"fuck you\" mentality that doesn't help anyone. When I complain it's because I can't control shit and I'm stuck in the situation that I'm in, you do have the ability to help people and to be understanding to people and change shit. \n\nAnd I didn't lump you in with that group, I said if you're trying than this post isn't for you, maybe read the post before getting all angry at fucking students.",

That was supposed to stay secret.\n\nIn all seriousness, if you knew how ridiculous all your accusations sounded you\u2019d need embarrassed. My department did a summer long pedagogy seminar just for teaching remote. We\u2019ve been in constant meetings and get constant assistance from the pedagogy institute on campus to help us. We have our own canvas sites dedicated to assisting one another and discussing pedagogy technique and concerns just for remote teaching during COVID. We, of course, all talk to each other regularly and help one other day to day. \n\n(You also don\u2019t understand how our research works in relation to teaching. Research keeps our job; teaching doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s not a choice - it\u2019s systemic for R1 universities. As I said, me and most of my colleagues have had almost no time to progress our research with this transition to remote, which jeopardizes our job. Most of us love teaching but we can\u2019t all just stop everything to hand-hold every class to an A. Our own livelihoods are at stake and, like it or not, teaching well won\u2019t keep it.)\n\nOne of the main concerns we have is around grading to account for the difficulty of the circumstances while still having some integrity in passing students. I can say without any question that 99% of the instructors I know are grading much easier and have given much more leeway this semester, even in the preparation of the syllabus.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve had a bad experience with some professors and your generalizing it to all or most in the entire university. I read your little qualifier at the start. Then I read a barrage of generalizations. If you want your concerns and critique to be heard, frame it better. Don\u2019t over-generalize and be specific. You don\u2019t know me and you\u2019ve generalized me into your vision of professors. Me and most of my colleagues have busted ass to make this semester productive and good. Your bad experience doesn\u2019t reflect the majority of what I\u2019ve been seeing behind the scenes at all.",

Not only are you forced to be on your laptop, computer, or tablet--which encourages people to wander onto other sites away from the lecture--but it's also harder to pay attention to the professor's screen if it's just a static image of a powerpoint slide when there is group chat happening to the right. Eventually, my teachers came to just pre-record lectures and offer office hours during normal class times. I felt like that was a better trade, because it let me watch the videos on my own time and also have a solid amount of time to get questions answered if I so needed it. The downside was that my day completely lost structure without going to class at a specific time each day.\n\nNone of this is the professors' faults, and I know they had little control over what they could do. That said, using Zoom over in-person lectures is a raw deal. I'm not advocating that we go back to in-person lectures just yet, but rather I'm providing support for my statements.",

When you go on the get a masters or PhD, they do not teach you how to teach. They teach you how to conduct research in your field. Also, some of the professors are old are not good at technology ( they didn\u2019t need this level of tech when they became professors), but many of them are still trying their hardest to adapt and create the best learning environment as possibly. One final note, FSU is a R1 university, which means that research is their top priority, not teaching. Research is what pays their salaries and they are required to produce a certain quota of research papers published to a certain tier of academic journals. Most professors are not hired to teach, but to do research. Teaching is just an addition that the university tells them to place below their own research.",

This is an honest question how do you expect us to engage students who don't show up?

I have a 15-page paper due tomorrow (that's just one of the smaller projects I have due this week), but I have had students emailing me all-day asking for grade changes. \n\nSo I have to take a break from my own school work and possibly risk messing my own grade up to respond to students who could have been more proactive earlier in the semester. On top of that, I also have to attend lectures and work a second job. My entire point was that it is unfair to put all the blame on your professors if you can't even show up to class and do the bare minimum.",

Have you tried interacting with students or engaging with the smaller class size? I show up to every lecture, I try to watch every lecture and do everything to participate and be active.

I prefer having smaller classes and was very fortunate to have at max 40 students in my classes as an undergraduate. However, it is not feasible at a large university like this where students are required to take classes in multiple disciplines. I have first hand experience with what happens when you already have small class sizes as it is and all of a sudden your department becomes short staffed resulting in less classes  being offered. When I was in my last semester of undergrad, two of my professors retired and a hiring freeze resulted in the termination of a temporary professor because their contract could not be renewed. The department was already short one person as well and were in the process of hiring before the hiring freeze happened. I had a couple of friends in their junior or senior year trying to fulfill their liberal studies requirement of multicultural awareness. They were pissed when they couldn\u2019t get into any of the intro classes in my department because there were less classes that filled up quick. My department had to offer less intro classes, because they had to offer specific courses for people in the major so everyone could graduate on time (e.g., some of the classes had to be offered for graduating seniors, while other required courses are not offered every year). \n\nMoral of the story is that many smaller sized classes are not always feasible. Having larger lecture classes for your general education courses is very common at universities across the board. Especially for large universities like FSU. If you don\u2019t like having large lecture classes then you should attend a small university.\n\nOne final note, it is difficult to engage students in classes of 100+ students. This can make the class very boring, but it is just part of life. You need to suck it up and move on.",

I have these students contact the professor, because as much as I sympathize with them, the professor needs to know what is happening since the professor makes final grade decisions. The professor I TA for has been extremely understanding and has helped students struggling who communicate with her. Communication is important. When you have 100+ students in a class, you can\u2019t know everything that is going on for every student, so students who are struggling need to communicate if they want help. Now you might be thinking \u201cwhy should I tell them about my personal life. Thats none of their business\u201d. I have first hand seen how bad of an idea it is to have this mentality if you except sympathy and understanding. When I was an undergrad doing research for a grad student, they disclosed to me an issue they were having with a professor. The professor was irritated that the student was not going to many of the departmental events, which is an unwritten requirement for grad students. She had a legitimate excuse to miss events on the weekends, that appeared to be non legitimate. She went to every Penn State home game with her fianc\u00e9. The reasoning behind never missing a game was because her fianc\u00e9\u2019s mother would bring his son to the games so he could get some quality time with his kid. She wanted to be present for this because she was going to soon be the kid\u2019s stepmom and wanted to be a part of his life. I suggested that they tell the prof and they responded with how it wasnt the professor\u2019s business. If they had been honest with the prof, the prof would have understood and they would not have been is trouble for missing events. I know a lot of people don\u2019t want to share personal details with their professor, but if the prof doesn\u2019t know your circumstances, they can\u2019t help you. It also then leads to the appearance of students being lazy when that is not the case.",

The professor came up with a solution for them so they could still take quizzes without needing a webcam. There was one problem with the student though. There first quiz was at the end of class from 4:20 to 4:50 and they waited to email me at 6pm to say that they didn\u2019t have a webcam and were not sure how they were going to take the quiz. The professor gave them a practice quiz the week prior and told the students to take it to make sure honorlock worked for them. She also kept the zoom session going for each quiz, so that if students were having technical difficulties that resulted in losing time, they could notify her and she could give them an extension through canvas.",

Us responsible people haven't seen friends and family in 9 months. Were alone, were stressed, our worlds are crumbling, and many of us don't even have the option to take a gap semester or even less than 12 credits.

A few thoughts:  \n\n\n* I'm certainly not going to apologize for/defend what sounds to me like pretty bad teaching, and there's no shortage of that in higher education. Of course, you could easily have had very similar experiences in a f2f class with no covid, etc. \n* Also not going to apologize for faculty lacking any empathy or kindness or at least reasonableness with students. It's never good, it's worse during a pandemic. And one of the lessons I've learned from teaching during this is a little extra kindness and empathy and flexibility on some deadlines and stuff is pretty easy for me to do.\n* Both of those things said: a lot of faculty/instructors across the country at lots and lots of different institutions feel like they've been completely ignored and/or seen as expendable by their administrations. And a lot (most?) faculty/instructors have some of the same problems/challenges teaching online and from home that students have too-- I mean dealing with the disease and how it's impacting their lives, dealing with family members or children all under one roof, dealing with a loss of income from spouses/partners, etc. Plus most faculty don't have a lot of experience teaching online and being suddenly pushed into all online all the time, well, that's not easy.",

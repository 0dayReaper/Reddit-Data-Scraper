The information I received with my gown about returning it does not have a \u201creturn by\u201d date for it to be returned, only instructions on how to print the return label. I have not received an email or notice or anything about returning it. Any idea if I can keep it or possibly pay a fee to keep it? Has anyone else kept their gown with no problem? Thanks.",

    "postText": "So I\u2019ll be graduating in December and I always envisioned going to London for my last semester. But lately, I\u2019ve been having a change of heart, and it mostly stems from not being ready to leave Tallahassee and not being ready to graduate college. I\u2019ve looked into combined pathways with MAAPP, and Honors in the Major to try to extend graduation until the Spring and stay in Tallahassee. If anyone can share their London IP experience, MAAPP, or HITM, that could help me decide. Honors in the Major is a stretch because the first deadline is Friday, and I don\u2019t have a faculty director yet. IP deadline is in 2 weeks.",

I cherish that experience so much and would recommend it a hundred times over!\n\nThat being said, I\u2019m a little confused about your perception of the pathways program. MAAPP is a 36 hour program. Doing pathways means that a you would do a few credits during your remaining undergrad, then you would apply and complete (as long as you get accepted) the MAAPP program, so you wouldn\u2019t be able to finish it by the Spring. Furthermore, London won\u2019t offer any of those courses. So your entire Spring semester would be grad classes (of which you can only take 12 hours max). Then you\u2019d stay another two 12 hour semesters to finish it.\n\nIf you\u2019re aware of this already and don\u2019t mind, then I would say it depends on your career goals. MAAPP is a degree best suited for those who want to work in Florida government. Much of the degree is a practicum where you do just that, work in FL government. It\u2019s not a common program that\u2019s easily recognized outside of Tallahassee. It\u2019s probably not worth it unless this is in line with your career goals.",

Kearley likes to wait a day or two before quizzes and exams to post answer keys which may be a problem if you don't go to office hours regularly, which can take hours from what I heard. Hilinski also curves more than Kearley plus he posts PowerPoint slides of materials. If you plan on getting skoolers, the material there would be more closely aligned with Hilinski's class.",

I had to drop Kearley despite having a paid grad student tutor to help me because the man expected you to have organic 1 completely memorized to perfection. He also made me cry in his office hours because he berated me for having a paid tutor, insisting he was stupid and so was I for paying him. Do yourself a favor and don't take Kearley.",

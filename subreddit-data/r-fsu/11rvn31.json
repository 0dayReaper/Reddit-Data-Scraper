It's incredibly relevant but it very closely toes the wrong side of the no politics rule.\n\nBeing how important this is and how.impactful this can be on education in Florida and at FSU this post is going to stay up.\n\nKeep the discussion as relevant as possible to FSU. Avoid name calling and comments that are nothing but incendiary to either side of the political spectrum. I'll be checking the thread regularly to maintain moderation, but report any comments you think might be too far and we will review.",

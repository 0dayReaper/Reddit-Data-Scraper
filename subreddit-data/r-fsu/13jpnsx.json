    "postText": "So, I'm going to be visiting the main campus this weekend to start getting the layout and figure out how to work my fall schedule. I do have a few questions regarding this if someone can help out.\n\nIn town, I'm hoping to get my FSUid card updated (mine is over 7 years old and from the PC campus) and the parking permits. What office/building handles this?\n\nWould I be able to immediately take a tour when I get in town or should that be scheduled ahead of time?\n\nWhat building is the data science and computer science grad classes in?\n\nI will be commuting from about 2 hours away. Based on my recommended schedule to help with gas and everything I may need just 1 night a week stay in Tallahassee. Do any hotels nearby offer like a 1 day a week deal for this for the semester?",

            "comment": "Regarding the first question, the FSU card center will handle it. they are right next to the bookstore outside of the union. When it comes to tours, you should try scheduling it ahead, simply because its easier. A quick search on their website should do. i\u2019m unsure about the other questions but i bet others have answers!",

The Love Building is where all of the Computer Science department stuff is, but classes are held in various buildings around campus. I took a CS grad course that was in the health and wellness center; it's really wherever they can find a room to fit the number of students.\n\nRegarding the commute, I don't know anything about hotels offering regular stay discounts. It sucks but, realistically, it might be most reasonable to tough out the 4 hour round trip commute if you're only having to be on campus once a week.",

My experience with FSU has only been with the Panama City campus, we essentially have all the CS classes in a single building between 2 floors.... At least thats how it was 7 years ago! But, considering the larger campus in Tally, I can definitely get that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll ask around when Im in town, from the schedule Ive been advised to register for (obviously i cant confirm this until august, but just rough advised) Ill be on campus 3 days a week. T/Th/F.  I would only need to consider having a room to stay for Th nights in this scenario. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks so much!",

My wife or I have stayed there several times for 1-2 nights each to visit our daughter for various events freshman year. It's actually more convenient and reliable than some of the better hotels like Sheraton 4 points which is what I did last Friday at twice as much.",

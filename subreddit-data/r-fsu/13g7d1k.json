    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m a non-nusing major that\u2019s trying to regsiter for a nursing course this summer that had (has?) a reserve cap. I emailed the nursing advisor earlier this semester who told me that the reserve cap would lift the week of drop/add, which is today at 12:01am for course I\u2019m aiming for. I\u2019m still receiving the same error message saying that \u201cavailable seats are reserved and I do not meet the reserve capacity requirements\u201d, so clearly the reserve cap did not lift yet. There are still 6 seats available, so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s full either.\n\nI was wondering if anybody else has had similar experiences with reserve caps, either in the nursing program or otherwise, where the cap lifted after 12:01? I was going to keep trying this weekend and hope it lifts but it seems like on Monday, when I can reach out to nursing advising again, it will be too late to add the class as that\u2019s when the $100 late registration fee starts. \n\nIf anyone has any information or tips please let me know, thanks!!",

For future reference, if you want to avoid the late fee, and you know you are taking a class, just enroll in a course to avoid the late fee, then make sure to get the swap done by the drop/add deadline.",

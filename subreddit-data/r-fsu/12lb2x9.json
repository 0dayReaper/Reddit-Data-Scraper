            "comment": "Discrete Math is a coinflip, ive never heard of a person who had a moderately rough time in the class, you will either breeze through it or it will hit you like a ton of bricks and theres no real way to tell till you take it.\n\nComp Org is just a bitch of a class. But, I took it with Tyson last fall on a 19 credit hour schedule and passed with an A, so it is doable. The class requires very little regular work but the projects are significant sudden escalations over anything you would have done up to that point and take a lot of time. The tests are just impossible, Tyson will openly admit the average is *supposed* to be somewhere between a 45-60 on them and he curves appropriately, so dont stress too hard about that.\n\nI never took a language or physics at FSU so I cant speak to either of those classes. What I will say is that to me it looks like you have a very reasonable schedule, but I also tend to take lots of credits and you have 0 \u201ceasy\u201d classes, so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nLast note, Tyson is easily the best lecturer ive ever had, his course is set up like shit and he cant return grades quickly for anything, but he is a ridiculously good teacher. Attend every lecture, take tons of notes, his slides are not nearly enough to keep up with the amount of information he provides during class and missing a class will absolutely mean you miss a huge chunk of what you are supposed to get out of that course. Best of luck.",

I had many professors pull me to the side at the end of the semester and thank me for taking their class because I participated and made it more interesting for them. \n\nDistinguish yourself in the classroom! Don't just show up to office hours thinking you will small talk your way into their good graces.",

Some classes might only have 25 or 30 people in them, some even less. Very easy to catch them before or after class and have a 2 min Convo, or office hours. At that point they'll remember your name much easier, especially if your a good or enthusiastic student. \n\nYou might have to grin and bare it through the first two years, but it will get better.",

    "postText": "It is really bad that there is only one party and that is is directly controlled by Burning Spear. The students need to form a resistance and take back the student government for the students, not just a secret society. \n\n\n\nI obviously cannot do anything but fan the fire. Voter turnouts are less then 20% even with 50% voter turnout we can beat them.\n\n\nPoll the student body to determine the biggest issues and how you would fix them.\n\n\nP.S. Current student government robs your money per credit hour.",

It's like the skull and bones you always hear about US presidents being part of. It's old money controlling shit by manipulating how things turn out. Instead of the student body getting to pick the president they want based on their approved agenda, this secret society is pushing its own agenda.",

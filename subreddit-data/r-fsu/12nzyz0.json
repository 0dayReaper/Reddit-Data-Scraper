I'd recommend finding people VERY ahead of time that you know are not using all of their tickets and asking if you could buy them. They are in absolutely no way obligated to give you or sell you those tickets, but that's usually what people do. Just don't harass people for them or make friends with people *just* for tickets because it's rude.",

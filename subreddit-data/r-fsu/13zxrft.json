    "postText": "Hey I plan on applying into this upcoming Fall 2024 cycle for the upper division in the nursing program as a transfer student. My freshman fall semester I ended with a 3.88 with all As in pre reqs and spring semester I finished with a 3.92 also with all As in science pre reqs also. Im currently about to acquire my cna license in a couple of weeks also. I plan on starting working this summer and continuing in the fall. Im still nervous about getting into the program even though they lowered some of the requirements and made the class size larger because of the competitiveness. I still have to finish a couple more prereqs in this summer and fall. Anyways I could help make me stand out as a better applicant? Also anyone who got into the program any tips with the application process?",

    "postText": "Hey, I was wondering if anybody knew much about the program and could tell me about their past or present experiences? I recently submitted my application and also would like to know my chances. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in health science. My Gpa was 3.4 cumulative. Received 3 great recommendation letters and my personal statement is very good. I also have some volunteer hours, joined a few organizations, and maintained a job throughout all 4 years. Should I be okay with getting into the university?",

            "comment": "I graduated a few years ago and was an ambassador for the college of SW during my time there (undergrad and grad). They look at your personal statement more than anything else because SW is a mostly passion-driven career choice. The professors are wonderful and most of them have worked in the field for a long time, so they have a lot of firsthand knowledge to share. The program staff are also great and were very helpful in directing my steps toward licensure after graduation. I can\u2019t say enough good things about my time there. Feel free to DM me if you have more specific questions!",

I left the field for other reasons but I think about that class often and use it in my career even now. The knowledge was so impactful and useful for most every career field and every day life. The internship part was what caused me to need to transfer out. I had a baby and couldn\u2019t manage being a full time mom while needing to work full time with an internship as well. But overall the program is great",

            "comment": "I just finished mine in December and was underwhelmed with the course selection (I wanted more of a software focus) there was a lot more data science offerings. The professors were alright, just a few that I liked and thought structured their classes well. With that being said I Ta'd the whole time and my only real cost for my masters was the cost of living. I was able to get a job as a C++ developer pretty easily afterwards. So it depends on what is important to you",

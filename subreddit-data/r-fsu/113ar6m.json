            "comment": "Living in Landis right now, and I have honors friends in Azalea right now. I'd say that there are benefits to both, but it all ends up depending on who you room with. \n\nI like Landis for the proximity it has to basically everything on campus, not many things are more than a 10~ minute walk away, and the dorm itself is well kept, has a very large laundry room, and is all-in-all a lovely living situation. And if you end up getting nice roommates, that'll make the situation even better. \n\nAz/Mag are very pretty buildings, are newer than Landis is, and have the 1851 directly underneath them. The courtyard between the two buildings is also very nice, and keeps the general area shady and cool, which is very nice in the hot months. Az/Mag do have smaller laundry rooms though, which matters more than you may think. \n\nTL;DR- Either choice you make will surely make you very happy. Welcome to FSU!",

            "comment": "Hello! I have lived in Azalea and have plenty of friends in Landis. Both are great but I'll explain the perspectives of both in detail.\n\nlocation: First of all, they are very close to each other, so the location isn't as big of a deal. I will walk to Landis hall from Azalea in a few minutes. Landis is directly on Landis green where many people \"people watch\" and honors-related things are hosted in front of the hall, compared to Azalea which is mostly regular students. Azalea Hall has 1851 but you will walk there all the time anyway if you don't live there so it doesn't matter much (just bragging rights). \n\ngen dorm hall styles/layout: I do believe Azalea has bigger rooms from my memory of visiting dorms in Landis but the rent may also be more bc of that. Not a huge difference. Both have good study rooms (Gilchrist students go to the Landis study rooms often bc Landis has the \"better honors\" dorm). Azalea is often compared to a hotel with its bright lobby and Landis seems to have a drier atmosphere with fewer people hanging out in the common rooms (some people like that Azalea is always busy and some do not, depending on you).\n\nbiases: I have also experienced Azalea as the \"best hall\" (as most freshmen will say) but also the one with the most drama (as most RA's will tell me and I have witnessed). Landis, IMO, has always been lowk quiet with little to say concerning drama as it is an honors hall and I assume, held up to a standard. Azalea and Landis are both freshmen filled so you will meet many people from it. Do you want a mostly honors dorm or a regular dorm with a few honors in it? \n\nAsk any questions if you feel the need to as it's a big decision, but you can't make the \"wrong\" one. Keep in mind, Azalea and Magnolia are literally the same exact dorm but people hype Azalea b/c of 1851 (but Magnolia never seems to have much drama from my experience and that may be appealing to you). Azalea kids will always brag because they have the newest dorm. Landis kids will brag because they got the main honors dorm. And many of my honors friends were put in Gilchrist because Landis had no room, so if you do not want Gilchrist (which is crustier compared to Landis), I would prioritize Landis and THEN Azalea if it's an option.\n\nHope this helps!",

I was honors and chose Magnolia. Landis isn\u2019t bad but rooms are generally smaller and older-looking. But the study room is really really pretty!

People messing around pulling the fire alarm leaving weird stuff in the elevators, ya know college kids being dumb. I will say I\u2019ve never experienced anything like that in Landis probably because most of the students here are quiet and study. Don\u2019t let that deter you though, my first roommate loved to go out to parties.",

HSA often does little events in the lobby/right outside. The back door also opens up to the Greek gardens (great for hammocking) and Landis is street accessible on two sides which is HUGE for move in, picking up friends, food delivery, etc (azalea is not street accessible, and the parking lot right next to it is exclusively for FSUPD/maintenance). Something I haven\u2019t seen people really talk about is the sky lounge\u2014Top floor of Landis has huge vaulted ceilings and gorgeous cathedral-style windows that look out over the green!",

Landis on the other hand is much closer to Suwanee, Stroz, and Chick fil A. \n\nDo keep in mind that Azalea and Magnolia are only 1-2 per room suite style with a shared bathroom with another connecting room, while Landis can have up to 3 in a room suite style, so you could be sharing a bathroom and shower with up to 6 people. \n\nLandis however does have access to the sky bridge which can get you all the way to Jennie without having to step outside, which can be super helpful in the Florida thunderstorms. \n\nRegardless of which one you choose, you\u2019ll have an amazing time at FSU!",

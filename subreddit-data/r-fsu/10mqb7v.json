    "postText": "So I received all my college decisions and I'm kinda torn between fsu and Texas Tech University (electrical engineering major). Just by ranking, ttu is nowhere near fsu (55 vs 219). I've read some not-so-positive reviews of the FAMU-FSU engineering college but all of those are 6-7 years old. Can anyone pls share your recent experience with fsu engineering? Also, as ttu is a STEM-centred college, would it be wise to enroll there based on that? I also liked the vibe of fsu just by reading other posts and I feel like I'll have an unforgettable college experience if i go to fsu\n\nEdit: Both the colleges offered generous scholarship so cost isn't an issue",

Lubbock isn\u2019t a wonderland but it is a fine place to go and get your degree (and then go wherever you want). I\u2019m currently in the northeast at a fairly prestigious academic center and wouldn\u2019t trade my experience at Texas Tech for anything.",

So the academics are about the same, but FSU is much more prestigious overall at 55 nationally and top 20 public. Personally, I was going to go to FSU-FAMU engineering over UF and UCF but I took a greater interest in statistics/data science!",

FSU is much older, \"prestigious,\" and better ranked overall. I'm pretty sure that FSU's MIS program is a top 20 program amongst public schools and no. 21 overall. FSU has a data science masters degree that is newer so it's probably not ranked yet, but I've heard good things. That aside, FIU isn't too far behind and is a fine school with a lot of opportunity in Miami!",

FSU engineering is off campus and shared with FAMU (have to drive / take a bus there). FSU will give more of a big college experience and Texas will be more specialized. Dependent on what matters to you both seem like fine options but Texas tech is more of engineering school.",

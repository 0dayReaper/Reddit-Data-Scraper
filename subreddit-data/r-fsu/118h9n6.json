    "postText": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m currently a transfer applicant for Fall 2023. I recently changed my major early on my application and now I have to change my current/ upcoming college schedule because the original major I applied with had a prerequisite that I was planning to take for the summer semester. Because I changed my major, I\u2019ve not required to do that prerequisite, and instead, I could take an elective to fulfill my AA degree. On my application, I created a new course schedule but after submitting it. The new course schedule isn\u2019t going through the system since it shows that the date submitted is the prior course schedule. I tried it again and it still didn\u2019t change. Do I have to wait a couple of days to let it process? Or should I contact admissions?",

            "comment": "The student view of the status check is always going to default to the earliest date of submission, annoyingly. It will never show you the most recent date. However, it very likely did go through. On the staff end, admission reps can see all forms submitted, and in the review portal it defaults to the most recent submission first.\n\nWith that said, the answer to \"should I contact admissions\" is pretty much always yes if it's something that's worrying you. They don't mind double checking.",

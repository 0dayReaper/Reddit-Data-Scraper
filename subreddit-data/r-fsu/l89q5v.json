    "postText": "I passed by some club by campus and saw a line going out the door of probably 100 or more slack jawed idiots, shoulder to shoulder, without a mask in sight.\n\nObviously that pissed me off.\n\nSo I did what any human being with more than half a working brain cell would do, and I rolled down my window and yelled at the morons to put on a fucking mask. When they all turned to look at me, I shit you not, there was not a single glimmer of intelligence behind any of their faces.\n\nHow hard is it for you Neanderthals to get it through your thick skulls? YOU\u2019RE KILLING PEOPLE. Obviously none of you have lost anyone to this shit, or actually taken the stay at home order seriously at all, so you don\u2019t understand how fed up everyone who hasn\u2019t seen multiple friends at once in months is.\n\nI\u2019m fucking tired of it. Stay home, or use your collective two brain cells to put on masks, at the very least.\n\nWe\u2019re so close to the end of this pandemic but you impatient children can\u2019t wait another goddamn month.\n\nFuck you and everything you stand for.\n\nEdit: thanks for the support everyone, I love and feel for any of you who have lost anyone close to this shitty situation. I wish there was real repercussions for these assholes but for now we just need to stand together.",

I'm not saying your overly triggered fear of covid is a bad thing.... but .. not everyone is as scared and worried as the media makes you think that you need to be. Ever since Trump lost the election MSM doesn't even hardly report on covid-19 or the deaths. The human population goes through these outbreaks every so many generations and all it has actually done is make our immune systems genetically stronger and passed down to our children and so on. This isn't the black plague  we are talking about here, it's covid... the happens naturally to help weed out bad immunity gene pools (natural selection) and make the human race stronger. Although I'm very convinced THIS viral outbreak was without a doubt a man made, and purposefully released event. I own a business in the construction trade that deals with vinyl/aluminum materials and glass, and the majority of the precursors we need to supply and make this extrusion vinyl IE lacqure ect is supplied by.. you guessed it. China \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 and now they are sending so little of the material and chemicals we need that's it caused product manufacturing lead times to go from 6 to 8 weeks up to 28 to 30 weeks. I find that no coincidence especially since the virus started in China. The country Trump was working so hard to stop taking advantage of us and our tax trade and tarrifs. Now the reduction of trade barriers and import tariffs with them is slowly destroying the construction industry, manufacturing of goods and will eventually lead to another economic depression like Obama faced in 2008. I know when you are IN college you don't understand how the real world of business and finance truly works, only what you see at these little Twitter orchestrated protests against the \"government\" and capitalism but once you get that degree and you finally try to put it to use in the real world you will realize how manufactured this entire event was and is. It's not dooms day... but MSM who is owned by billionaires who are in bed with Chinese communists and globalists have created a pandemic and fake panic in Americans to turn over our freedoms for safety \ud83e\udd14 hmmm.. give me liberty or give me death. I choose to not wear a mask. Sorry not sorry. Especially while at a night club on campus where I'll be drunk and have a better chance of catching the clap \ud83d\udc4f then covid-19. Also how can one say they are against the government having too much power and being a \"big brother\" and thinking you are so \"woke\" yet you stand side to side with big tech like Twitter, Amazon, Facebook to \"change the world\", that is not being a liberal. Censorship by big tech on our free and open internet being pushed as being \"on the right side of history\" as someone else posted earlier, and covid being the means to push out this new agenda, deplatform a sitting president and keep you as a free American stuck at home, making absolutely NO human face to face interaction is exactly what the globalist socialists want. So you can't think for your self, only what you read on Twitter or reddit, and only one side of the isle is considered correct or you're deplatformed and don't get to have a voice. Standing with MSM and big tech to change the world and fix the country is litterely the biggest boot licking, knee bending thing I've ever heard. Covid is not the real danger here. Think about that my friend.",

Most of the faculty is fantastic. You can easily get involved in research as an undergrad, even in theory (Dr. Febres-Cordero is fantastic!) \n\nThe bad: You absolutely will have to sacrifice your life outside of academics to succeed in the major (Full disclosure, this is why I left the major - it was a choice between physics and literally having any life outside of school.) Once you reach 3000-level courses, you can easily expect to spend 30-40 hours a week minimum on homework. For exam prep, I was easily putting in 50-60 hours in the week leading up to the test. While none of your professors will be bad at teaching, there are a few who are honestly just awful people. The professors for mechanics and math physics casually demean students during class. \n\nSome of the bad is I\u2019m sure true for every physics degree, but this was just my experience. Lemme know if you have any questions, I\u2019m happy to answer them.",

The engineering program and the physics program aren\u2019t really comparable in terms of difficulty. The engineering programs are a ton of work to keep up with the workload. The physics program is hard to keep up with because the material is bash your brains out difficult. You have to know plenty of programming and tech skills and other nonsense for the physics major as well. And in terms of creativity, the work in the physics major requires much more creative problem solving than I ever encountered in engineering courses. There\u2019s a reason that plenty of physics majors go on to get a masters in engineering, but the reverse is very rarely the case. The level of rigor necessary is just not present in engineering programs.",

The courses are taught at a high level and absolutely prepare you for graduate level coursework (if you're planning on that). There are ample research opportunities in any field you like, especially in experiment. I can also say that there has not been a single professor who was not willing to offer me advice when asked (and typically spent a significant amount of time doing so), which was invaluable during the graduate school application process. And if you're worried about UF somehow having more prestige than FSU in undergraduate physics, that should not be a deciding factor - I chose FSU over UF when I was deciding where to transfer, and I have been accepted to several top 15 physics PhD programs for next fall. The schools are essentially equivalent, and for grad school having more individual attention/opportunities is most important - if you're not getting that at UF, then leave. \n\nI don't agree with the comments regarding demeaning or non-encouraging professors. In particular, the mechanics professor is quite possibly the best teacher in the department. If she tells you that your knowledge is lacking, it's not because she's trying to embarrass you, it's because she cares and she wants to let you know what you have to do to improve. If you show adequate effort, there is not a single professor in the department who will not support you. However, the person who stated that the work load is difficult is not exaggerating - it's a full-time job, and that is not realistic for many people. That is the cost of getting a good physics education, and you have to love it and want to do it. It helps that the cohorts are generally close knit, and you will make many friends while you're going through these tough semesters. \n\nFinally, the professors really care about being inclusive to all students. There is a panel on the topic that meets regularly with professors, grad students, and undergrad students. Additionally, the department arranged for a review by an external committee, which included meeting with undergrad and grad students and asking them questions about their experiences. The results will be summarized in a report, and I can guarantee you that the professors are going to care about what was said. \n\nIf you have any other specific questions, feel free to PM me.",

The introductory physics classes are deliberately made gruelingly difficult by some professors (in my experience, particularly Chiorescu - also Hori based on hearsay). They expect you to have a conceptual grasp of mathematics you have not yet been required to learn and have an aptitude for problem solving that is not characteristic of most introductory physics students. Once you get past that, the vast majority of the faculty are either extraordinarily kind and helpful individuals (Reina, Tabor) or are intimidating at first but overall nice and helpful (Prosper, Blessing). Additionally, the physics advisor (Valencia) is very nice and helpful. It\u2019s a good choice in my opinion - I have enjoyed my experience as a first year undergraduate so far. Just make sure to research who your instructors are.",

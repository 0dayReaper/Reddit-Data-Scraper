Today I put an alarm for 5pm so I can register for the 5-6pm class Monday because registration opens 24 hours before, but I randomly checked just now and it already says there\u2019s no more spots left?? It\u2019s only 4pm?? So now I\u2019m extremely confused. Is this a class you have to register for in person and not through the app? Is it only reserved for a select group of people? Anyone else having this problem?",

    "postText": "I feel a little embarassed writing this considering im a 3rd year entering my 4th next fall. Regardless of this I feel like this is this subreddit is my last option. Ive had a really hard time socializing here at FSU (even when I go to club events), if I ever do hold a conversation its usually nothing worth becoming long time friends. I am in a long distance relationship and my girlfiend is at a point where she feels guilty for going out because I dont really have a social life anymore. The clubs I go to are usually the bigger events ran by the bigger generized clubs so I wanted to ask if there were any niche clubs or just normal ways to make friends here that imignoring.",

I find just asking people to study with ya and then inviting them out for drinks or movie watches just let\u2019s you connect with people more than you ever would at a club.",

I'm a huge introvert and I've made lots of friends there. \n\nThere's a free beginner lesson every Friday night at 8pm in HMU114, no dance experience needed. I didn't have a single ounce of dance skill and I loved it, so don't be intimidated if you think you can't dance! Once you're comfy with that, we have advanced lessons as well where we learn different styles of swing dance and stuff like that. You can also follow the Instagram @/swingdancefsu and get added to the discord for more info/announcements when you come to a meeting.",

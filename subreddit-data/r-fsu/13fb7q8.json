    "postText": "Hi, I got an email from admissions saying that since I have 90+ credit hours (I\u2019m transferring with an AA) I need to submit a personal statement including how I accumulated those hours, why I hope to transfer to FSU, why I selected my major an a plan for a timely graduation. Has anyone submitted this? Should I be concerned? I hope you can help me, thank youu!!",

Answer each question completely and try to demonstrate that you have a plan in place for success once you get here. They aren't looking for reasons to deny people but they do take the statement (and your academic patterns) seriously when making decisions.",

They are looking for why FSU , Why your major and how many credits you\u2019ll need to complete the degree.  They are very proud of their on time graduation statistics and this is one of the things they make students do to show you are likely to graduate in a timely manner.. if you are lucky or well planned you will be able to show you can graduate in less than 45 credits.   Daughter only needed 23 so you are probably alright.  Remember there is a excess credit 120% of credits for degree) and then they charge out of state tuition, they don\u2019t want you in that boat either.",

For her that threshold happened at 153 credits (and none of her transfer credits counted against this) so she needed 60 credits for engineering and 27 for international affairs .  90 is less than 153 do it was easy to justify.  You need to sit down with s department advisor and figure out how far into your degree you are.  I\u2019m guessing you have all the prerequisites.  Some degrees count other things toward major.  You need to show a plan .",

I hope everything turns fine for both of us! One last question, you wrote it as an essay right? I\u2019m new to the country so I\u2019ve never done one of these and I have no one to ask but yeah is supposed to be an essay and how big was it?",

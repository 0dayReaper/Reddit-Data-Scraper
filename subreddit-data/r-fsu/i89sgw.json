Staff were pretty adamantly opposed to this headline, but the supervisor from Gannett (company that helped the paper operate) pushed for it so it got published. Myself and others were kind of upset because we felt it was like a tabloid headline and like it cheapened the achievement of the team.",

On the other hand, it\u2019s sometimes okay to go low brow to please the masses if you don\u2019t make a habit of it. Thanks for working on the paper! It was one of my favorite reads during my time at FSU.",

Most of the time we didn\u2019t take ourselves too seriously and we definitely had our fun...just really disagreed with this headline. Talked to the old editor in chief this morning and he said he was fine with it. Maybe I\u2019m just a stick in the mud!",

            "comment": "The crazy part about this game is that FSU won it in basically the first five minutes. SCAR was driving down the field in their opening possession. On 3rd and 4 at FSU's 20yrd line, Garcia tosses a pass to their star RB Marcus Lattimore, FSU's Greg Reid spies it, and heads straight for Lattimore with a full head of steam. He lands one of the most brutal and clean hits you'll ever see, creating a turnover and knocking Lattimore out for the rest of the game. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3PIURaEvFc",

    "postText": "I'm going into my second year and wasn't able to get an apartment style on-campus with my desired roommate, so now we've been looking for apartments off campus. Right now we like University Village and Whitehall the most. Does anyone have any opinions on these? We're considering 2x2s so I believe this is Oaks University Village (which has pretty bad reviews). Whitehall has mixed reviews but we liked it.\n\nAlso, if anyone is looking for a Rogers apartment style spot in a 2x2 please contact me. I might be giving it up depending on how this goes.",

            "comment": "Whitehall is solid for the price. I did a 2x2 a couple of years ago and was pleasantly surprised by how much space there was in the rooms. The walk to campus is minimal and parking is pretty much always guaranteed on site. Only downside is that there\u2019s essentially no amenities (pool, gym etc). My gf did university village for a year and it was pretty horrible from what I remember. Constant leaks that lead to mold and maintenance for any issues took weeks to resolve. But on the other hand they had a pool and gym. Don\u2019t know about their rates on a 2x2.",

You can\u2019t lease thru their website so you need to go to their office (the small building in the back) and talk with the Landlord or an employee, I hope they have spots left!! I would also email/call them if you can!",

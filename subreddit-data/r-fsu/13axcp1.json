    "postText": "Has anyone solved the issue of the fire alarm going off when you even just try to turn the coils on? Coil stovetops usually burn off any excess oil while heating and that produces some smoke/burning smell which trips the (insanely) sensitive fire alarm. Any safe hacks to help alleviate this issue? I have the stove fan and two other fans in the kitchen aswell to no avail. Thanks for any help",

So if something says cook on high instead of putting it at like 7 I\u2019d put it at 5 or so.",

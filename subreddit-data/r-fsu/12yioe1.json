    "postText": "FSU has no song for Football games. To the tune of Alabama\u2019s \u201cDixieland delight\u201d or Tennessee\u2019s \u201cRocky Top\u201d. This song says Osceola and Seminole plenty of times and is a great song from the 90s! It is about Okeechobee and the Everglades being destroyed by man made intervention so it has a good message.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/7xdQBiKGzfN8ripbLkihWu?si=P5SdcvneRM23VCl8cOg_Jg&amp;dd=1",

Many of FSU's students, past and current, are from South Florida.\n\nMy understanding is that the song is openly critical of the fact that the everglades were drained for housing developments and the growing of sugar cane (one of the thirstiest crops in existence and destructive to the land during harvesting). It's essentially calling for the everglades to be reflooded which would wipe out a couple significant communities and farming industry (requiring the use of an alternative sugar source such as beets as well as base resource for ethanol)\n\nNow, depending on your stance, this is either more or less important: The song is slow as hell.

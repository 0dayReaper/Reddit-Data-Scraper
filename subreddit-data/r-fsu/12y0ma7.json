Personally I\u2019m looking to pursue a PhD program but I chose neuroscience because it combines psych and bio my two favorite subjects. I\u2019ve had good experiences with the majority of my professors in the program so far. I was/am deterred from the regular psych program due to the lack of rigor for what I wanted to do but it works for some students.",

            "comment": "i knew some neuroscience majors who were interested in med school down the line, and they said that was their reason for pursuing neuroscience (bc like you said, the required classes for pre-med are built-in to the major's core requirements). i assume if you do a psychology major on the pre-med track, not only would you have to fulfill the psychology requirements but also pre-med stuff on top of that (which may be doable within 4 years but it's better to try killing 2 birds with 1 stone when you can, i.e. take 1 class to fulfill 2 requirements)\n\nfrom my perspective, the neuroscience professors i've had were pretty good and i enjoyed the classes despite not being very big on neuroscience myself lol\n\ni also volunteered in a neuroscience lab for a year which is really rewarding if you want research experience! didn't have many issues there, and there were opportunities to grow and learn a lot of skills in that lab \n\ni was a psychology major (not pre-med) and really enjoyed it! the psychology dept at FSU is great and i rarely had issues with professors/classes. you're right that it is easier than a neuroscience major, but the way the neuroscience major is set up is better to prepare you for med school imo",

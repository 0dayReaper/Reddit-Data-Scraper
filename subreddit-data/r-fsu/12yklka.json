            "comment": "i've done both, but i think UROP is good if this is your first time trying to get in a lab \n\nin UROP, they give you a list of professors who are actively looking for UROP students for their projects. a lot of them are aware of the workload you are required to do and will help you get the required hours, do your poster presentation, and write a letter of recommendation for an award at the end that you can apply for. \n\ncold emailing is also okay if you don't want to go to the colloquium class and do UROP-specific assignments (just a few basic writing assignments and quizzes about introducing you to research). it's not a hard colloquium by any means, the bulk of your work is gonna be with your lab. also, they mostly offer UROP to freshmen and sophomores, so that's something to consider if you wanna take the opportunity while you still can. \n\nwith cold emailing, you may not be guaranteed a volunteer/DIS position, and it's not guaranteed that you will be able to be part of presentation based on the needs of the lab. i'd do the UROP route for that reason, too, because the required presentation looks really good on your resume. an upside to cold emailing is that there are multiple ways you can participate in a lab- you could be a DIS student, FWS student, or just a general volunteer. in UROP, i believe you can only get volunteer hours. \n\nin my experience i think it was easier to find another lab (by cold emailing) after i finished UROP because they saw i had research experience before, but some labs are willing to take beginner volunteers with no issue! that's just my personal experience lol",

            "comment": "So I both did UROP and just finished up the leader prep course to teach the colloquium next year. I will say UROP is a really great experience and does provide you a lot of really great resources to help support you throughout undergrad, especially by connecting you more with the CRE. There is, as others have said, some busy work in regard to attending some required events (making a poster for the symposium, going to the presidents showcase etc.) but the actual colloquium only meets twice a week. The non-research parts of UROP took a negligible amount of time, and although some things imo are a little arbitrary, I cannot recommend the experience enough. Even the required parts of UROP I personally found to be extremely useful, and in my opinion really helps you not only to get involved with research, but learning how to communicate and present research effectively. \n\nEven if you don\u2019t match with any of the mentors that sign up to take UROP students directly, you can still cold-email professors regardless and if one of them takes you in then that can count for UROP. The benefit I see in UROP is that if all else fails you\u2019ll still be matched into research in some capacity. And again, like others have said, cold-emailing professors after UROP and having that experience in your resume is a great advantage!",

If you want to apply go for it, but if you don\u2019t match with a lab that you are interested in or see yourself doing something with drop out of the program. I stayed in it and worked on a project that was unrelated to my major or what I want to do and the project and class while it provided research experience felt like busy work. \n\nThat being said I also cold emailed and applied for DIS positions independently and matched with one. If I were to do it over I\u2019d probably go with cold emailing, just something to think about.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m an accounting Major here at FSU and I am looking towards getting my CPA. I can easily fulfill all of the requirements, except for the 30 credit hours of ACG and TAX without having to go through a masters program. FSU seems to only offer 24 ACG and TAX credits out of the 30 we need to get a CPA with only a bachelors degree. Anyone who has or is aiming for a CPA can you please help me and tell me how you are getting all 30 class credits? Thank you!\n\nAlso I know I can do an internship class but I need to complete two late classes firsts and I am a freshman right now.",

            "comment": "Graduate FSU\n\nEnroll in University of West Florida as a non-degree seeking student. You should easily get in. Take 2 accounting courses offered by the university. Should cost you $500-600 per course. \n\nIf you don\u2019t wanna do University of West Florida you can take the classes through LSU or University of South Alabama. They\u2019re about the same price. Keep in mind you don\u2019t need to \u201cpass\u201d these classes. Even getting a D will count towards your CPA credit hour req. As long as you don\u2019t completely fail you\u2019ll be fine. The only other requirement for the CPA credits is that the classes need to be on a semester or schedule of some sort. So an online class where you go at your own pace and offers a Pass/Fail (such as WGU) don\u2019t count. Just keep that in mind. \n\nThen enroll in community college and take 8 courses of anything. They can be about basket weaving, cars, or the medieval history of the frogs for all they care. Just take something.\n\nBoom! You got the credits you need for the CPA.\n\n**NOTE: if you don\u2019t plan on living in Florida then these requirements don\u2019t apply. I\u2019d still recommend doing the Florida CPA Licensure requirements because Florida and New York have the most difficult CPA requirements. If you can meet licensure in FL you\u2019ll meet the requirements in every state.**\n\nOverall you\u2019re looking at this costing you about 4 grand if you do this all online. Much cheaper than a MAcc. This is my plan after completing my internship with PwC. Graduate in this coming fall",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m an upcoming student who has 2 holds on his FSU account. One is the immunization form which I understand somewhat what to do, but the second hold is my orientation hold. I\u2019m mostly confused about the orientation hold because I\u2019ve already applied and set up who is joining me for orientation. Is the hold there until the actual physical orientation finishes? Or am I missing something?",

The syllabus implies there will be no makeups and if you miss the exam you're screwed.\n\nedit: thankfully she's letting me reschedule. ",

For what it's worth, contacting \"the administration\" or \"the dean\" Will always result in a referral back to the instructor to first make sure you attempt to resolve the issue with them. After that, it escalates to the department chair. Fun fact, a Dean's office, academic advisor, or anyone else like that has no role in any grade dispute. So don't contact them it's just another email at a busy time of the year",

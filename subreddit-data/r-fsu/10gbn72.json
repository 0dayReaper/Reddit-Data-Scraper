    "postText": "Hello! I'm a rising sophomore and I have a group of 4 confirmed roommates for next semester. I have the highest number of credits, currently at 62, and I will have 74 by the end of the semester. I believe they only count credits completed in Fall though. How are our chances of scoring either a 4-person apartment in Ragans or 2 2-person apartments in Traditions? We prefer Ragans because we would all be together and it's cheaper. Please share your experiences/knowledge! Thank you :)",

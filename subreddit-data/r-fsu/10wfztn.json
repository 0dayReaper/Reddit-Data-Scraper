Does anyone have any experience working full time at FSU while being a part time student? How flexible are the class schedules vs. work schedule? Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "It really depends on your role and supervisor. By policy you can only take one class during working hours so if you\u2019re doing a program that doesn\u2019t really offer classes outside of work hours it can be a problem/may take longer. It\u2019s a good program overall, but since it isn\u2019t a guarantee you can have a different experience in different departments.",

I did this through the last 2 years of my undergrad and I'm currently a year into my grad program doing the same!\n\nClass schedules are going to be super different from dept to dept - most grad programs try to keep working students in mind but it's varying degrees of thoughtfulness. The earliest courses in my program start in the afternoon after lunch, and most courses are offered in the evening or online. My supervisors have always allowed me to flex my work time if I needed to take a class during work hours, and I currently supervise an employee who flexes to accommodate a Wednesday morning class. If your supervisor is chill, it can be worked around. \n\nIf you have any specific questions, I'm happy to answer what I can. My experience with this setup has overall been very positive.",

My boss was incredibly supportive, and I think you'll find most are. Mine didn't care when my classes were,  but I found that I really did better with 8AM classes, then go to work afterward. When I took one in the middle of the day, it was tough to shift gears and also tough on my work schedule (I had a lot of ad hoc meetings come up; just the nature of my role). Everybody's a bit different with what they do best at. If I couldn't get an 8AM section, I took the class online.",

            "comment": "This is my 4th semester using the waiver and I\u2019ve had no issues with it. \n\nSome details on the actual waiver - the waiver usually covers most of the cost of the tuition, for the first 3 semesters I only had to pay about $500 out of pocket rather than the $3300+ for the two classes. The waiver was just over $2800 per semester. This current semester I only had to pay $6 out of pocket, so it can depend from semester to semester. The costs depend on your program, class choices, and any fees associated with the class like lab fees or tech fees. \nYou will need to complete the tuition waiver form and send it to your supervisor and department head and they will sign for you. You used to have to include the course number and time of the class, but that\u2019s no longer needed. \nAs for classes - thankfully, none of my classes have been during my 8-5pm schedule, and have been either 8-10pm or 6-8pm online using Zoom or Blackboard Collaborate. You are allowed to take one class during your schedule but you must clear it with your higher ups, which shouldn\u2019t be an issue. You shouldn\u2019t have any issues getting the tuition waiver as long as you\u2019re accepted to a program and you have completed your 6 month probationary period. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have any issues anywhere along the chain. My supervisor brings up me being in the masters program all the time to the various groups we work with around campus. \nBest of luck to you, we are excited to have you with us as faculty/staff and as a student!",

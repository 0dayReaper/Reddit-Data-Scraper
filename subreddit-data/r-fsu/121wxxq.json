Sometimes they have events or water polo but it would be marked.",

All FSU swim and dive meets are held at the Marcom aquatics center at innovation park. \n\nThere is never swim meets at leach, but you may be seeing swim club, which holds their own practices. Also, if members of the swim team choose to swim at the leach pool, they are doing so as students, like anyone else.",

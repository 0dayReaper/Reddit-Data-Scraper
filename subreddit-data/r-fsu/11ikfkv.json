            "comment": "I saw your post on A2C! There is no harm in applying, but I commented this on your post: \n\nChiming in because I'm going to FSU as an instate student. In my opinion, there is no reason to go 80k+ in debt for either school, and instate tuition/parent contributions is a HUGE no brainer. I'm going to FSU for free with their scholarships, Florida Bright Futures, and money my parents saved for me. However, if I chose UMass, I would easily be tens of thousands of dollars in debt. In this day in age, you can learn most of the contents of your degree online for free or a small cost. After your first job, no one will even care where you went to college. If you went into debt by going to FSU when you could have gone to UMass for the same education for free (or paid for), you seriously put yourself in a poor financial situation that will effect your life in the future.\n\n\\-\n\nFSU is a great school, but no college is worth going in debt over. You can move to Florida or a warmer climate after you graduate, which you could do with zero debt! Without parental contributions and very rare scholarships for out of state students, it is very unlikely that you would be able to attend FSU without compromising your financial security. The education you will receive is about the same at both schools and are not worth going into debt over.",

If you\u2019re a good student you can even get a scholarship that makes your tuition pretty much the same as in state. Again, not sure what the tuition situation is in Mass but I agree with not going into massive debt for college if there\u2019s a cheaper option.",

            "comment": "If you can cover the app fee there\u2019s no harm in at least applying. FSU has really generous out of state scholarships\u2014 most of my friends freshman year were from OOS because it was cheaper for them to go here than to go to any school in state. \n\nJust saw the aforementioned post on another sub. If your main reason for wanting to come down here is the weather, keep in mind that the grass is always greener on the other side. It\u2019s hot af down here nearly at all times\u2014 summer starts in February and ends in November. People I know who are on campus all day long pick extra shirts in their backpacks because you sweat through them throughout the day. Most of the year it\u2019s 80+ and in August/September it occasionally cracks 100, with 95-100% humidity for months on end. If the weather is a big component of you wanting to do this, I\u2019d maybe even recommend you take a gap year after high school and move down here to work and check out the state for awhile before spending tons of extra money on school for the sake of the climate. \n\nTotally get desiring independence and the people being snarky in the other sub about how you can\u2019t have independence if you want your parents to help with school are full of it or at least missing some nuance. Having physical space from your parents, a social life where you don\u2019t have to ask permission to go grab food with friends, and the opportunity to do daily life on your own terms (maybe you find that you prefer doing dishes in the morning rather than at night like your family does\u2014 you\u2019d never find something like that out by living with them!) is a really important part of social development in the US and it\u2019s not stupid to want that\u2014 you don\u2019t give many details on why your parents will only pay for UMass, but if one of the reasons is that they live nearby and want you to live at home, I would absolutely say going to another school for independence is a valid choice. Part of why I picked FSU was it was 4.5 hours away from my parents and I could have the space to grow up a bit without them, and that was a great move that enabled me to come really far as a person. FSU isn\u2019t your only option for that though\u2014 maybe you could reach a compromise about attending a different school In Massachusetts or a neighboring state. \n\nIf you\u2019re really set on this, try to talk to your parents in a logical way rather than an emotional one. If you\u2019re coming out of high school you\u2019re still very young, and if the only argument you have for yourself is the weather and wanting to have a fun experience, your folks are unlikely to consider your position because you\u2019ll be coming off as a kid. Think about what draws you to FSU (especially beyond the weather/distance)\u2014 is it because we\u2019re a top 20 public school? Do we have a degree program you\u2019re in love with? Research opportunities? Are you passionate about joining our circus? Having some evidence for your position could help. Also try to understand where your parents are coming from and why. Unless they\u2019re abusers or awful people, I bet they have a good reason or two as to why they\u2019d prefer you go to school in Amherst. Maybe there\u2019s a really good scholarship or discount they know of which will cut the cost of college down substantially. Maybe they feel like you aren\u2019t ready to leave the nest yet (be curious\u2014 why might that be? Could you do something to help assuage their fears?). Try to listen to them to understand where they\u2019re coming from. Treat this conversation as \u201cyou and your parents vs. the decision\u201d rather that \u201cyou vs. your parents\u201d, I think you\u2019ll find it\u2019s much more productive. \n\nIf the decision comes down to your parents refusing any help at all, I\u2019d say think carefully about the decision from a pragmatic and financial standpoint. If you\u2019re set on FSU and paying for it yourself, don\u2019t take out extensive loans to cover a $2000/month one bedroom apt and party until you drop out. Try to reduce use of loans and cost of living as much as possible. (Have roommates, live further from campus to get cheaper rent, work part time, stay away from Uber Eats and the bars.) Consider whether you\u2019ll be able to pay the loans back at all. As unfortunate as it is, education in liberal studies and fine arts do not present a great return on investment. It\u2019s a very different thing to take out loans for an actuarial science degree (pretty much guaranteed 60-70k salary the day after graduation with good potential for growth) than for a BFA in theater (pretty much guaranteed you\u2019ll be a barista). If the major you want to pick is unlikely to pan out into well-paying work, first consider whether college is actually needed for that (it may be better to take online or rec center drawing classes in your spare time than a 4 year studio arts degree) and then whether you\u2019re willing to be saddled with an insurmountable loan payment for the rest of your life if you\u2019re determined to go to FSU to get it. \n\nThis is a nuanced decision. Try to approach it with as much maturity and careful thought as possible. I hope you and your family arrive on a decision that\u2019s best for you!",

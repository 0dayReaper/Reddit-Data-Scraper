I am in Tallahassee campus, so does this mean I can't enroll in it even though its online?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Reached out to the Stats department and they said were made aware of this yesterday and the Panama City campus is working building it.",

They normally update the available classes up to the first enrollment day, which is March 6th, so I wouldn\u2019t be worried. Also, every previous years summer class snapshot has showed STA 3032 available so that\u2019s reassuring.",

I'm trying to see if engineering will be a good option for me at FSU. Also random but what is the  pre req engineering class like at FSU? (it's called FYEL i believe)",

All the other typical pre req classes like calc sequence, physics seq etc are difficult but you can mitigate that by studying",

She still has a year to go and has already interned with LM last summer full time, remotely this whole year and will full time this summer.  Her boss has told her he will match any competing offer she has before graduation.  Don\u2019t worry you\u2019ll be fine at FSU CoE.  FWIW U know kids in CoE at UF and UCF.  My daughter has much better access to engineering profs than her peers at the other two schools.  One prof called her last Saturday to help her with last minute finals prep.  I never saw that at UCF or UF.",

I had a similar experience, had around 50-70% for months then poof a 94 or something.\n\nGot a 32% on the first project I believe, with major points taken off for somewhat minor errors. Although they admitted it was basically a hazing class since upper level engineering classes/the engineering career are super detail-oriented. They gave huge extra credit opportunities near the end of the semester.",

Some of my colleagues also graduating: turbine engineer at Blue Origin, test engineer at Air Force Research Laboratory, and a structural analyst for JPL. \n\nTLDR: FAMU-FSU College of Engineering can lead to excellent job opportunities. Definitely check out the ongoing research at the Florida Center of Advanced Aero-Propulsion on the COE campus.",

Internships give employers an opportunity to see how you actually work, so whether you get a reference from that internship or a job offer, it can be more valuable than the name on your diploma. One of my former high school math students got an internship at the mag lab while at COE and the job offers poured in after she showed what she was made of there.",

From an outside observer looking in it seems like it\u2019s very possible if your a go getter and understand that what you learn in class is only a portion of what companies expect you to learn but that goes with nearly every major. Especially anything STEM. I think the biggest difference was the two kids applied themselves did stuff beyond what was just in their classes and clubs like networking, personal portfolio projects, career fairs etc.\n\nEdit: LH to LHM",

US News has it currently at #92, and #4 in Florida. Since they rank 10 schools in Florida, FSU is in the upper half.\n\nIt's probably never going to happen, but I think FAMU and FSU would probably be better off if each university had an engineering school on campus and specialized in different areas. Like agricultural engineering and mechanical engineering are in FAMU's name. FSU could specialize in other programs like aerospace and biomed since FSU already has a jet propulsion lab and medical school.",

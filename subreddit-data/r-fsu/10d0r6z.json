    "postText": "Hi all, need a 1 credit class to meet requirements for an application to grad school. Is it fine to take something easy? Or should I look into a full class / science lab 1 credit course to be safe? This would be for the summer term. \n\nI have a robust GPA (3.9) and multiple research projects, so I'm hoping my application is good enough to let the easy credit class slide. During the summer I will be working two jobs (50 hours expected a week), plus work as a tutor on the side at FSU, and will be taking 4 credits for linear algebra. That said, would taking an \"Easy\" 1 credit class alongside all that be best considering workload? Or would that harm grad school applications? I want to be reasonable about my limits, but I don't want to look as though I'm copping out by taking an \"easy\" and unrelated 1 credit class such as Pem 1121.\n\nAlso STA 5920 \"Stats Colloquium\" is a listed course. I'm not sure what it is or how to get involved as an undergrad, but if anyone knows more about that option please let me know. It's a more related subject than a science lab, so if it's viable I'd rather take that. \n\nThanks for any help!",

            "comment": "there are not many statistics classes offered in the summer session. i\u2019m not positive but I doubt they would offer 5920 and doubt you\u2019d be able to take it as an undergrad. my last semester of undergrad, summer 2020, I took linear algebra and needed one more stats class to finish my major and the only one offered was 4321 which is 3 credits and I would not recommend taking it unless you needed it. if there are no specific courses you need I would just take an easy 1 credit one, there likely won\u2019t be any statistics-related 1 credit courses over the summer unfortunately",

Diphenhydramine, the active ingredient in Benadryl, while exceptionally good at reducing the symptoms of allergies, is very hard on your liver, and can also cause brain damage. Brain damage from DPH use has been observed both in cases where individuals took a very high dose, and in those who took the medicine regularly.\n\nUnless you're having a really bad allergy day, it would probably be wisest to use Claritin, Xyzal, or Zyrtec. I personally prefer Zyrtec, as I found it handles my allergies well.",

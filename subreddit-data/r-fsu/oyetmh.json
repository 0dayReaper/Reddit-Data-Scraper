They haven\u2019t said how random tests will work if they happen at all. \n\nSo yes you are probably right, it will probably spread freely amongst vaccinated people but eventually I suppose globally we have to get to the point where we don\u2019t worry about the vaccinated anymore and let them handle themselves.\n\nI\u2019m not sure FSU has the resources to test all students regularly even the vaccinated ones, if they even wanted to. Resources, to me, would also include logistics such as how that would work with so many people to regularly be forced to test. To me it sounds like a nightmare to enforce and perhaps not even possible.",

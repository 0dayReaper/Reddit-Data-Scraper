I will be majoring in biology on the pre-med track and have gotten into both honors colleges. I live in Tennessee but both schools are the same cost.

Personally i think fsu is a better school academically and campus is gorgeous - the trees and vibe is different and more scenic but UT campus is great too. Knoxville is awesome. Layout is different - all the action is on one street - cumberland/the strip. Tally seems more spread out for bars restaurants but i have only been there for a long weekend. I would look into their med schools as far as an edge getting in from their undergrad programs. If you dont know any students at UT and have any specific qs let me know. Btw my son at ut has been to fsu twice and loved it. Visit both and trust your gut - thats what i told  my kids. Good luck",

    "postText": "i got accepted to both UF &amp; FSU, i was dual enrolled so i\u2019ll be coming over with my AA. idk which school to choose, it\u2019s really 50/50 so can anyone tell me what pre vet at fsu is like? obviously they don\u2019t have the vet school, but i\u2019ve heard the classes are less competitive/teachers are more attentive &amp; they have the pre vet club. my main question tho is how i\u2019d take the 2 animal science courses that fsu doesn\u2019t have? would i take them online while at fsu (through another college) or after i\u2019m done at fsu before applying to a vet school..how does that work?\ncan someone also explain the social life of fsu? it\u2019s stereotyped as the party school out of the two but me being someone who\u2019s more introverted &amp; rlly anxious i don\u2019t want to end up hating it",

I\u2019ve gone out 3 separate times, you have to a few times to experience it, and it really isn\u2019t for me. You can 100% avoid going out if you find the right friends who will respect that. You will see people going out or coming back from the club almost every day, but as long as you do what YOU want to do, you\u2019ll be okay. \n\nThere are over 800 RSO\u2019s that can provide you with anything you could possibly want!",

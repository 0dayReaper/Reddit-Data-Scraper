Would also like some alternatives maybe? I\u2019ve recently switched majors to pre-engineering.",

CHM2210 took over my life and MAC2311 I dropped and took it at a CC. I took calc in high school and passed with an A. I thought calc here would be the same. The TA who I had taught it as more a philosophical dive instead of just drilling doing the math. Not a good time.",

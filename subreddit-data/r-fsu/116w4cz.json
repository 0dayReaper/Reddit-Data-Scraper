    "postText": "I am looking for apartments via Student Housing Solutions. I just have a couple of questions.\n\n1. The posted monthly rent for a one bedroom at Villa Lucia is $948. Although, when I added up the one-time fees (application, Express Checkout, Pet), they don\u2019t quite add up that $948. Not even when I add the monthly fees (excluding Occupant, Upstairs Unit). Is it some kind of printing error or something?\n\n2. What exactly is Express Checkout?\n\n3. Exactly how furnished are the apartments? Fully furnished? Just furnished? Semi-furnished?",

            "comment": "Express Checkout means you pay a fee when you sign your lease, usually like $200-$300 or so, and that covers them cleaning the apt when you move out. It covers normal cleaning like carpet steam/shampoo and sanitizing bathrooms, changing light bulbs and other minor stuff. It DOES NOT cover major cleaning things like scuffed or broken walls, garbage bags or other items left behind. You will get a separate charge for those. \n\nSome complexes require the express checkout and others it\u2019s optional but if you don\u2019t do the express checkout you\u2019ll need to leave the place in a very clean condition when you move out and possibly show a receipt to prove that you had the carpets professionally cleaned close to your move out date. They are gonna ding you for every minor thing, so good luck if you take that option.\n\nThe fun of dealing with student housing!",

            "comment": "I lived in Villa Lucia for 2 years and I really enjoyed it. It was my favorite place I ever lived. That was probably more of a function of me getting by far the biggest room in my 3x3 and really doing some cool stuff with it. The complex was fine, nice neighborhood, convinient location, and the pool was usually well maintained.\n\n$948 sounds insane to me per month because I paid $600/month (not including utilities) up until I moved out last summer. \nPart of that was me being grandfathered in at my previous price when I signed, for a non furnished unit, back in 2020. \n\nI know rent has gone up everywhere in Tallahassee quite a bit, but damn that still sounds so expensive.\n\nAnyway they have options for furnished. I'm pretty sure they can make any unit furnished, and all you get is a bed, a dresser, and a desk. \n\nIF every other person in your unit also gets it furnished then you get a couch, TV and coffee table. \n\nI saw my roommates furnishings and was not impressed. For me, I took the money I would've spent on renting furniture and just bought cheap furniture on Craigslist or Facebook marketplace, for less money, and then sold it when I moved out and got a bit back.\n\nExpress checkout is their cleaning service when you check out. I'd highly recommend it because I have heard that they are really strict about their cleaning rules if you don't buy it. But I don't think you need to decide when you sign?\n\nAnyway, I did the express checkout and had some small holes and scuffs all over the paint, as well as stains and other things and they didn't charge me for anything. They're pretty chill if you do express checkout, but it obviously won't cover major damage. Just keep up with your maintenance requests and it should make it easier when you move out.",

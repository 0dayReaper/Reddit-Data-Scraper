But the University President does appear in the video, and it's Sandy D'Alemberte which means the video is from his tenure, which was 1994 to 2003. Later on in the video it's also mentioned that the University Center is new, which places the video in the late-90s, as the University Center complex wasn't 100% finished until 1999 (parts were open before that though). That's as close as we could figure.",

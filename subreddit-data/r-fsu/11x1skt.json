It was 39 at my toss, but one of my friends went in when it was below freezing. \n\nCome prepared with the warmest change of clothes you have and don't hesitate to change once you get out. \n\nWear the biggest jacket you have to the toss, and take it off immediately before you go in. You'll be fine. Happy bday.",

    "postText": "So I planning on dropping a class for late drop, and it was covered by bright futures. I know that I have to pay it back. I wanted to know if anyone has done this before how is the process like paying it back, I assume it's through the FSU portal, but when do I have to pay it by, can I extend deadline for payment, etc?",

    "postText": "Does anyone have any input on the HSC CMA Internship and whether it's worth it or not? Or should I try to just get an actual job as a CMA? For reference, I am taking 10 credits over the summer (Physics A, Animal Diversity Lab, and Exp Bio Lab) on top of regular volunteering.  The thing that worries me is being able to find a CMA job that is part-time in the summer since a lot of students will be working then as well.",

            "comment": "Oh I did this during the summer as well.It depends. Also I hope you mean you finished the course but are just unsure about doing the internship part .\n\nIf so I didn\u2019t do the internship. It was during Covid so things got thrown off. I believe you can find a job still. I got a job at an urgent care. The issue is you really get thrown into the deep end. So you have to learn fast and on the spot whereas the internship allows you to ease into it. So it depends on you. You can survive without an internship but you\u2019ll need to find a place that trains you well because you didn\u2019t get as much practice as people who did a year of an internship. So it\u2019s possible but also may be harder. I got lucky because it was covid so they needed anyone. But idk if places will be picky about you not having the internship experience, but again those places are out there.\n\nHowever I would be careful because that\u2019s a full summer and you want to work? Animal Diversity Lab isn\u2019t hard but a lot of detail to memorize. Then Physics is tough and a lot of work. You\u2019d probably only be able to work part time as a CMA .  \n\nLong answer short it isn\u2019t the end of the world if you don\u2019t do it. You can still get a job but looking back I wish I could have done it just to have more practice and not have to be stressed learning on the job. I learned and did fine though so take that as you will\n\nEdit: Also a plus to the internship is that you can use that as patient care hours outside of employment. That helps with whatever field you go into whether it be PA or med school. But I think it\u2019s very valuable, however if you don\u2019t have time for it it\u2019s not the end of the world just know that you\u2019ll have more limited job options and work harder in whatever job you do find",

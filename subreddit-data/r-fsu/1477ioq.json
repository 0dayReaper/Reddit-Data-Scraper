    "postText": "Hi I am an incoming freshman starting FSU in the fall this year and I was using the schedule assistant online. I am a biological science major and as I looked through the classes online, there seemed to be only two for freshman, BSC 1005 (GEN BIO NON-MAJORS) and BSC 1005L (GENERAL BIOLOGY LAB). Am I supposed to only select these two for my schedule? I am not familiar with how the scheduling goes.",

            "comment": "BSC 1005 (and its lab) is for non-science majors I believe. Looking at the [requirements for the Biology major](http://undergrad1.its.fsu.edu/academic_guide/guide-display.php?program=biological-science), it looks like your first Bio course should be BSC 2010. When scheduling courses, you should select courses that satisfy stated requirements for your degree.",

            "comment": "I was a biology major as well! Your first semester, you will take both BSC2010 and BSC2010L. Then your second semester you will take BSC2011 and BSC2011L. But if you already have credit for MAC1105 (college algebra) usually advisors will tell you to take chemistry (CHM1045 &amp; CHM1045L)  first but that is totally up to you. \n\nBelow is a sample degree map (although it shows taking general chemistry first) \nhttp://undergrad1.its.fsu.edu/academic_guide/map-display.php?program=biological-science\n\nFor example, my first semester I took:\nCHM1045, CHM1045L, ENC1101, MAC1140, and a random core requirement (13 credits)\n\nIf you already have credit for ENC1101 sign up for ENC2135! \n\nHope this helps",

            "comment": "Schedule Assist is a little funky. Good for seeing your course layout, not for choosing classes. Talk to an advisor or look at the course map for your major and sign up through the regular no frills version of the website, then use Schedule Assist to look at the schedule you\u2019ve created for yourself because it will tell you if there are any accidental overlaps.",

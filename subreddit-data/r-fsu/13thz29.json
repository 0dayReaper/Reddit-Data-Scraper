But I definitely wouldn't lock it up at night or at an area on campus that is low traffic during the day time.  Also put a few Airtags on it so you can track it just in case it gets lifted.",

I bring it in lecture halls, food areas, strozier, the union, etc. Not sure about dorms but I\u2019d say you can prob charge it in the dorm, but maybe don\u2019t ask and just do it lol. Goodluck to you!\nedit: grammar",

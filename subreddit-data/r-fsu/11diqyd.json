    "postText": "Hey everyone, I got accepted into UCF and FSU. I am doing data science BS and I am in a situation of choosing. I like both colleges, however, I do not know anyone who will be going to UCF with me and I would be going to dorms alone and wouldn't have any friends. However, going to UCF is better for my career because of the partnerships they have. (Not sure if this will lead to more internships). If I go to FSU I will know a few people and will be able to dorm with them and it is number 19 in the state. However, I am not sure how good their data science/computer science program is. I am not trying to flame both colleges as I love both, so any advice would be much appreciated.\n\nThanks.",

            "comment": "I can't say for sure how good the computer science program is, however I know it is incredibly popular and from what I always hear it is very challenging. My two cents would be to choose FSU for the simple fact that it is rated higher than UCF and harder to get into. But choose what you feel is best for you!!",

            "comment": "Both schools are good but consider the environment you want. FSU is a very college centered town so it\u2019s fun when you\u2019re in undergrad (alumni speaking ). I\u2019m at UCF for a Masters which is very different but Orlando is harder to adjust to because it\u2019s not a college town. It\u2019s a regular big city. So there\u2019s way more to do than Tallahassee but can seem overwhelming . So consider which vibe you prefer. And if you know people at FSU that\u2019s pretty comforting. So that\u2019s a factor but yes look deeper into the programs. I know at FSU you can look up a major map and see the requirements for the major. Compare that to UCF and see which one is more relevant or structured better. Majors differ across colleges. For example, some colleges make biology just a biology major , but in others it\u2019s automatically a premed major so you\u2019re required to take extra stuff that another bio major elsewhere wouldn\u2019t take. So look at the course list",

FSU is a great school daughter attends getting dual degree in  Computer engineering and International affairs.  Faculty and admin she has had interaction with have been fabulous and she has made great friends.\n\nUCF has internships.  These pay and you get experience that definitely matters when graduating and looking for first job.   I live in Central Florida and was able to have her intern with Lockheed at KSC last summer.  They offered to let her continue interning throughout the school year remote.  She is the only person in engineering she knows with a part internship during the school year.  I know lots of kids from UCF who intern for any number of companies from Space to Disney.  So you are right to think about your goals in college.\n\nApart from internships ,  UCF is a huge commuter school.  FSU is an almost everyone is from somewhere  else traditional college experience.  \n\nIn both cases you will get out of it what you put in.  And both will produce degrees that will will make you marketable.",

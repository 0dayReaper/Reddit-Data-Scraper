    "postText": "I recently got into FSU honors undergrad for econ and I\u2019m at least 90% I\u2019ll end up attending, although I\u2019m not committed. I really want to visit FSU/Tally at least once before committing because I\u2019ve never been (only to other parts of Florida) and want to know what it\u2019s like. I don\u2019t think I can truly understand that vibe from YouTube videos and virtual tours.\n\nHowever, since I live in NJ, even a one day and night trip would currently cost around $1k, and my parents aren\u2019t happy paying that money. That\u2019s whether we fly into Tally or Jacksonville with a rental car. They also aren\u2019t sure about taking a trip closer to or in the summer, multiple reasons for that, not important. The only thing I\u2019m asking is if there\u2019s a less costly way that we can make the visit. The plan was for us to leave on March 20-something after a school day, fly in, spend the night, tour FSU the next day (skipping school), then fly back. No time for a road trip. If not, that\u2019s fine.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ll continue looking, it will be tough with my dad and I\u2019s tight schedules (he\u2019s the one planning on flying with me) but I hope we\u2019ll find something, and in any case I think I convinced my mom of how important it is for me to visit FSU before committing.",

Flying into jax/Tallahassee is expensive.\n\nAre you close enough to NYC to fly out of JFK/LGA? Could probably save $$ if you flew out of one major airport into another.\n\nYou can fly from NYC to atlanta, Orlando, or Tampa for about $100 round trip based on current google flight results.

            "comment": "Yeah your only options are to fly into tallahassee or fly into Jacksonville, Panama city, Orlando and drive. As other reply said this was the hardest part about FSU is the geographic isolation. I\u2019m from PA so the flights were usually on the pricier side to go home and I always had a connection. If you have a car or reliable friend with a car you could fly from another airport. I did Jacksonville the most since their parking was always the cheapest for me and I had a friend there when I didn\u2019t have a car. I rode down to Orlando on redcoach tho definitely lucky I made my flight with how much could have gone wrong. Panama city the parking is insane to pay and theres no way to get there without a car. I did Atlanta once I got my car but my extended family lives there so I parked at their place for free and usually got a ride. Depending on where in Jersey you could try Southwest, Spirit, Frontier, or Allegiant to Jax, orlando, or pcb (has southwest I think) and can be cheaper and will probably be a nonstop from Newark or Philly.",

It has a stop within campus and takes around 4 and a half hours from the orlando redcoach stop. You could also drive down to orlando. And you can definitely find cheap flights ewr-mco ( I got a return fare at 330$  during christmas-new year's time) thanks to united having quite a big presence in both airports.",

UF also doesn\u2019t allow in-person second bachelors, online only, so you can\u2019t even go back for the major you actually wanted.\n\nIt\u2019s just a cash grab for the university essentially. Instead of rejecting people they\u2019d usually reject who would then go to community colleges and transfer in, they just accept them as second class citizens to take their money instead.",

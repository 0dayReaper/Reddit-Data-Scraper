    "postText": "So I am currently taking a class and unfortunately I am not so confident in passing. I know if you retake the class and get a passing grade, it can exempt your failing grade. I was wondering however if this works in the transient level. Can I retake the class in another college, transfer the credits, and exempt the failing grade?",

You can replace a grade for the purpose of admission to a major that requires a specific grade in a course or meeting a course grade requirement for graduation (usually) but the original grade will still also be calculated in your GPA. Same deal with transient work.",

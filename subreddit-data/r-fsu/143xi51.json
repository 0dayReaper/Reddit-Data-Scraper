            "comment": "Personally I had a grad student who taught my philosophy class which made it very unstructured and unnecessarily complicated. The subjects of the course are honestly pretty interesting but gathering the will to do the readings as well as constructing the arguments for the required papers made it challenging. All in all, it\u2019s an intro course so don\u2019t be too scared. Just make sure you show up and stay on top of the coursework to make it easy. I found YouTube to be super helpful for simplifying argument structures and the more complex readings. If you have any other questions lmk",

Our grade was only made up of a few quizzes and essays. The quiz questions were extremely vague and confusing so the class averages were always low. For the essays, we were given a short prompt and had to play mental gymnastics to figure out what exactly he was looking for. I learned that the best way to get high scores was to get started as soon as the prompt was posted and send your drafts to the TA to get feedback. If I remember correctly I ended with a B+ with some of the highest essay scores in the class. The quizzes are what really brought me down. Also, class would often get cancelled at the last minute and he never responded to his emails or went to his office hours. I might have just gotten really unlucky with my prof but from what I\u2019ve heard PHI2010 isn\u2019t a great class for most.",

I got an A- with absolute minimum effort and I had a friend who got a B+ in the course reading 50+ pages per week so just make sure you pick a decent teacher. Regardless, if it is a six week class, it should not be too difficult.",

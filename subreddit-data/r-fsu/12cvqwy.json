    "postText": "We are in Tallahassee for a baseball tournament.  We just took a campus walking tour and my son fell in love with FSU.  It wasn\u2019t really on our radar before this.  Now it\u2019s all he can talk about.  \n\nCan anyone tell me what grades and test scores might be needed to qualify for the out-of-state tuition waiver?  The admissions counselors at the tour were a little vague but said most people qualify for some sort of financial aid.  \n\nMy son is a really good student (gifted program, 6 AP classes, dual enrollment, double accelerated math, all A\u2019s).  Good work and volunteer experience.  His SAT test scores are low though.  He\u2019s not great at standardized tests.  We are working to get his scores up with classes and tutoring.  \n\nI know FSU is hard to get into, especially out-of-state.",

            "comment": "As the parent of a senior who will be attending this fall, test scores are definitely a deal breaker. My daughter had a 4.6/4.0 and a 1340 and was offered no merit aid and didn\u2019t get into honors. I was directly told that her problem was her test scores. She took 12 APs (already passed the 8 she\u2019s taken), 14hours of dual enrollment, has been working steadily at a job for two years, did summer programs at FSU Med, interned at a doctor\u2019s office, and still has great traditional extracurriculars. \n\nThey may have more leeway with the OOS waiver scores, but I also saw people with similar profiles to my daughter not even get in, so who knows.",

Out of state applicants can\u2019t apply EA so you have to do RD by Dec 1 but I sent my app in October because I was done and applied honors which I think possibly showed the admissions board that I really wanted to come so perhaps that could help.

I think it went up this year. 32 ACT or 1410 SAT or higher is probably correct. Once we visited it was game over. So far he loves it and the savings is tremendous. FSU is no longer a safety school for anyone.",

My daughter is a junior and her year was definitely a 31 ACT as that is what she had and she got in, Also, they super score both ACT and SAT.  GPA minimum is 4.0 with their weighted system, not whatever an individual school uses.  But even if GPA is amazing, if the SAT/ACT doesn't meet the cu off, then you can't get the waiver. My daughter BTW did much better on ACT vs SAT, so if your son has been struggling with a good score on SAT, perhaps try ACT, or vice versa.  Good luck to him!",

            "comment": "My daughter got an oos tuition waiver for music. It was worded \u2018for exceptional musicians\u2019 so there may be something your son qualifies under. However, she will be using veterans administration money and she will be given in state tuition because it\u2019s federal money. The oos is not applied once that happens. She did get a separate music talent scholarship as well, and the oos had no baring on that.",

I'm a FSU grad and we threw in an application before the Dec deadline but Auburn had always been the leader.  She got into FSU with an out of state waiver.  We visited last month and it was all over!  My daughter matches the last post indicating 4+ GPA, No C's, 32+ ACT.",

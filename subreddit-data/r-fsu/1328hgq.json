    "postText": "Hello Reddit Users,\n\nIf you need to satisfy your communication requirement, take Online Communication and Presence (COM2080) with Dr. Svitlana Jaroszynski (Dr. SJ). This class is so easy, and if you do 3 surveys on SONA, you will get 3% added to your final grade; for instance, if your final grade is an 89%, with SONA you can get bumped up to a 92%. This class only requires blogs, speeches, along with a midterm exam and a final exam.",

I had a TA that interpreted the syllabus using the word \u201cmay include\u201d to mean \u201cis required in order to get an A\u201d. She said multiple times that in order for something to get full points it needed to be completely perfect- and I often felt like she was searching for things to mark off. \n\nI passed the class with a very high A, (98%+) but I really disliked the class because of the TA.",

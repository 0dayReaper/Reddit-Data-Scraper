    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI am looking to receive a medical drop. I know some of my friends got it for the covid semesters. My only question is does the university call your doctor to verify your documentation? My doctor who did my covid test is a family member of mine and if the university is calling, its gonna open up a whole can of worms w my family asking me why I need it or why I have not been doing well in school. \n\nThank you so much.",

            "comment": "COVID in and of itself is not enough to get a medical drop approved. The general standard for medical is that it has to impact at least two weeks of classes And so there would have to be documentation to show that there was some type of bad COVID that really knocked you out for a couple of weeks.\n\nRegardless, first step in a medical or mental health course drop is to request the petition packet from your Dean's office. Once they send it to you, you submit it and documentation to the university committee for review who makes a recommendation to your Dean's office. Standard policy on campus is that Dean's office is always follow the medical drop committees recommendations since they are the medical professionals.",

In fact, if you don't also sign the authorization form in the packet, they can't consider documentation from your doctor because otherwise it constitutes the doctor violating your medical privacy rights.",

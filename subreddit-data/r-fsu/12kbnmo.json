Yes, it costs a little more, but your time is worth something, too, and I don't find 3 hours of extra driving worth it for the once every few years I need to fly.\n\nTallahassee airport is small, with limited flights, but that means getting in and out is quick. The only downside is the last flight in at night, whether American or Delta, is often late.\n\nYou're about to be in college. Make your life here if you decide to come to Tallahassee. Save the trips back to CO for the longer breaks.",

TLH is so small and has so few flights a day that are all usually ridiculously expensive. \n\nI don\u2019t have a car in Tally and so what I do is either get a ride from a friend, or take the redcoach down to Orlando (the redcoach stop in Orlando is a 10 minute Uber from the airport, and the redcoach stop in Tally is right next to the Pensacola St Garage). \n\nFor a bit of price comparison a flight from TLH to where I\u2019m from (major northeast city), would be $450-650 round trip for a weekend trip home and would take like 5-6 hours due to connections. To get to JAX or MCO and then fly from there would be like 6-8 hours (3 hour flight and 3 hours to JAX or 4 hours to MCO) and would be $200 ($150ish for the flight round trip and if you had to take redcoach add another $50-70 round trip). Me personally, I\u2019ll take the slightly longer day of travel to save that $250+.",

There was a small hotel (forget the name) I used to stay at that was v cheap, but provided a shuttle to the airport and you could leave your car there during your trip. It wound up being even cheaper than parking in the airport lot. \n\nSo id leave Thursday night and fly out of Jax Friday AM.",

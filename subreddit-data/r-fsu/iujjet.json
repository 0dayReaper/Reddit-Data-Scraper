                    "comment": "There won't be much of any problem with USPS getting ballots out to voters. They get mailed to voters a full month in advance of the election. I don't think many experts are worried about that not being enough time. And if you are truly worried about this, at least here in Leon County you can elect to pick-up your vote-by-mail ballot directly from the Supervisor of Election's office. \n\nThe worry is that there might not be enough time for voters to complete them and mail them back, _especially_ if they wait to do so until closer to the election. But this problem is easily remedied. Here in Leon County, you can hand-deliver your vote-by-mail ballot to a dropbox at any Early Voting location or the Supervisor of Elections office. You can also track the status of your mail-in ballot to ensure it was received, your signature was verified, and your vote was counted using the tool on [their website](https://leonvotes.org). This is how I did my mail-in voting for the August primaries. It was the easiest my voting has ever been, and I've been voting for almost 20 years now. I didn't even need to go inside the Early Voting location. The dropbox was set up outside, with a socially distanced pollworker standing nearby to keep an eye on things. It was so easy I plan to vote this way for the foreseeable future. \n\nAlso, please rememeber that in Florida, we do not have a postmark law for vote-by-mail. This means your ballot must be received by the time polls close on election day. So if you're returning your mail ballot with less than a week to go until the election, you should definitely hand-deliver it to ensure it is received on time.\n\nhttps://www.leonvotes.org/Vote-By-Mail/Vote-By-Mail-Information",

Since most by-mail ballots should be staying within the county, I imagine local voters should receive their ballot just 2 or 3 days after it is mailed. If you live further away, or had it sent to the old address and forwarded, that'll take a bit longer. Also, if you signed up to vote-by-mail after the initial mail-out, your ballot would have been mailed out about 2 days after you signed up (according to Leon County SoE).",

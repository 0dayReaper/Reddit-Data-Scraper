Or is it a standalone FSU study center? How do you ensure that the classes they offer are very similar (if not exact) to the first year courses at FSU main campus (Tallahassee) pertaining to your major? How many credits are needed for successful FYA (15x2=30 credits) program so that you can get out-of-state tuition waiver for the remaining 3 years? You can DM me if you like. Thank you so much.",

It\u2019s even sort of a running joke that it\u2019s hard to learn Italian in Italy because many Italians want to practice their English with you\n\nLearning Italian is far from necessary especially in Florence, but the locals will definitely appreciate it and be impressed if you know some Italian\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention though, in smaller cities, it would be beneficial to know some Italian. In many of the smaller less touristy towns people don\u2019t speak as much English. But in Florence most everyone speaks English",

It would save us money in the long run since I would get in-state tuition, about $40k, but is currently unaffordable.

    "postText": "Extremely disappointed to see that the school hasn\u2019t done nearly enough to prevent tailgate parties and limit the spread of covid. FSU has the most cases of any Florida school and is located in the poorest part of the state, which means all of these selfish college kids with full health insurance are absolutely screwing the low income residents of Tallahassee. On or off campus, FSU absolutely has a responsibility to prevent new cases amongst its students. \nI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s ruining your college experience, it\u2019s ruining lives. Do better.",

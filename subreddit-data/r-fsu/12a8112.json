To those who have graduated, do you have any regrets? Anything you wish you would have done differently, places you wish you had explored or visited, things you wished you had prioritized or appreciated more? I realize I'm a lot more worried than I should be, but I'd like to do as much as I can to make the most out of my last couple months here.",

It becomes incredibly difficult to make even surface level friendships after college. I have a handful of good friends from college, but I wish I had developed the others too instead of letting them go by the wayside due to my own stresses at the time.\n\nYou can always get more degrees, or go sightseeing later in life. You really can\u2019t replace deeply developed friendships built over 4 years.",

I graduated 10 years ago and even now when I have that first warm day in February it always makes me think of the first day of the semester seeing landis packed with people on blankets and tossing frisbees. \n\nAnd remember, whatever you\u2019re doing is enough and FSU will always be there for you to visit. If your first time going to Momo\u2019s is as an alumni that is okay too. This was fun for me to think about those brick buildings and beautiful trees again.",

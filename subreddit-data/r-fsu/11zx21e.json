    "postText": "I live off campus but spend a lot of my time there studying. I hate going back to my apartment for lunch (inconvenient) and prefer warm meals over a snack. I\u2019ve never had a meal plan before but have payed to eat at the dining halls and around campus. I got an email about the new block 25 meal plan. Those of you who have had meal plans before\u2026do you think it\u2019s worth it? \n\n250 dollars for: \n-25 meal swipes\n-25 dining dollars\n-a Daily Cash equivalency swipe ($6.50)",

            "comment": "Its not much of a discount off the door price for the all you can eats.  Probably better to just pay for your meals with your credit/debit card, and you can then also use the retail food courts as well.  The meal plans are convenient if you live on campus, but in that case you would be getting a larger meal plan where the prices are a bit reduced from the door price at the dining hall.",

            "comment": "Don't bother with a meal plan as savings are minimal and unused swipes are lost if not used so could end up costing you money instead of saving.  If you get dining dollars there's a slight savings over cash. Dining dollars unlike swipes don't expire.",

Whether you use every swipe for a retail location or go to the dining halls, you're still saving money, even if it may not be a huge amount. Plus, you don't have to waste time/gas (if you drive) traveling, and Dining Dollars are tax-free, unlike credit/debit and FSUCash.",

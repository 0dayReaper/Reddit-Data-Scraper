I\u2019m sad about this negative interactions - aside from being sad that he\u2019s leaving . \nalso his birthday is coming up and I wanted to do a trip just him and I mother / son trip to LA but I\u2019m scared he\u2019ll not want to go and it will break my heart \u2764\ufe0f. He\u2019s my youngest and I just want to make it great \u2764\ufe0f",

It\u2019s avoiding the topic so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about leaving the life he knows and dealing with so many unknowns in the future.\n\nHe also might feel like you\u2019re pushing him out and want him gone if you mention it nonstop, like you\u2019re excited to see him leave.",

Instead of \"Do you want to practice for living alone?\" OP could instead just ask for help with the task or ask that he does them as a favor.",

Ask him if he wants to go to that Marvel movie instead and make actual memories with him. Let him grow up on his own. But have fun with him like your kid in the meantime. It'll relieve the pressure on him and you. He'll call or ask a friend if he has a question in his new place. Hell, let the girls he meets show him how to do laundry, isn't that one of the fun things in college?",

If he\u2019s living in the dorms or has a meal plan the cooking isn\u2019t as important yet, and if he\u2019s in an apartment sometimes we have to fail on our own before we learn, especially at 18/19. Just enjoy the time you have left with him and by parents weekend he will be excited to see you!",

I mean , how would you want to be talked ti if you were him?  \n\nDo you want to be micromanaged on what kind of pillow to buy?  no.. also at age 18 or 19 , would  you want to go on a vacation with your mother?  ( to LA? I don't get that  WTF is in LA?  That's where YOU want to go, it's not where he wants to go, try  Costa Rica maybe , Spain, Greece)    \n\nLet him go. \n\n You want to do something nice for his BD?   Buy him a nice laptop. or a new phone. He'll appreciate that .",

When I was in his shoes, I was pretty snappy with my mom when she\u2019d constantly bring up these topics bc I don\u2019t like nagging, but also because I was insanely nervous and didn\u2019t want her to see me that way. It\u2019s not a good reaction, but it happens at that age sometimes. I\u2019d say to introduce these topics to him slowly, like baby steps. Maybe do 1 topic a week and then move on to a different subject once you both have gone over it until the next time. That trip sounds like fun! My mom and I did a girls trip and it was a blast \ud83d\udc97 you should totally introduce it to him, but maybe not for his birthday? He might want to do something at home. Definitely go on it together though either before or after! Goodluck mom you got this\u2764\ufe0f",

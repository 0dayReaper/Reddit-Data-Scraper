On the Windows side, Skip the Dell (their heyday has waned) and I will echo others opinions here and recommend a decent Lenovo.  Not a bargain consumer model (ThinkBook) as they are generally heavier, lower quality materials, and lack much of the famous durability.  Get a ThinkPad or a good quality Yoga to get you through your 3-5 years here and you won't regret it.  Buy accidental damage if you tend to be less than careful with things (read: broken more than one phone in your life)  Just my two cents.",

    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m kinda freaking out because I am terribly sick since Wednesday. I have an exam tomorrow morning and even just walking to and from the healthcare clinic on campus made me very dizzy. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do well on this exam when everything like light hurts me. I gave my Professor a photo of a thermometer showing I have a fever of 103.8, and proof of clinic visitation that states I should not return to class until 24 hrs fever free. \n\nMy professor hasn\u2019t responded about my possibility of a retake exam and it\u2019s stressing me out. Should I just be patient or should I contact someone else about this?",

He\u2019s nearly impossible to get to respond in email. If you tell him you\u2019ve emailed ahead of time, that would also be good so he has proof before the exam as well.",

Just double check your syllabus to confirm there aren\u2019t other instructions there about missing a test.",

Continue to follow up by email. If you don't hear back, find your professor in person when you are no longer sick and provide the evidence.",

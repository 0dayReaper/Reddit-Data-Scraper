I\u2019ll say it\u2019s pretty hit or miss but with that bein said they weren\u2019t going to revoke me, but they wanted to see me grovel. They might make you write an explanation paper as to why you got that grade, but they won\u2019t not accept your $!",

And if you get anything lower then a passing grade you can also write to admissions and explain why and if it\u2019s good there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll still get in I know three people who did that last year when they got a F",

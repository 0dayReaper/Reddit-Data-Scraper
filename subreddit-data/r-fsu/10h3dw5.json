You\u2019re making shit up now putting words in my mouth. Have you ever heard of the concept of false pricing? When FSU meal plan purchasers are expecting to get a certain value per meal based on the agreement they signed up for and yet they get charged a price they did not agree to. Stop trying to defend something that is literally illegal. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 817.41 Section 1. The price for meals at the union are literally advertised on the meal plan purchase advertisements yet students are charged more than they should. Don\u2019t defend illegal actions of others it\u2019s not a good look. Now get off your high horse buddy. Your defending law breakers at this point.",

If dining dollar was hit on accident I can tell you right now there is 0 form of refund they can offer you directly (POS doesn\u2019t allow refunds that way) and you would have to fight it with whoever is in charge of meal plans, when a person swipes for meal swipe it asks the cashier to confirm, but it DOES NOT for dining dollars which is a huge platform issue that the cashier can\u2019t really control but they should notify you if it was accidentally charged.

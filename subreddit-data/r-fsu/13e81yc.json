The amount of time to go thru each course is an estimate.   I think UCF charges $60 for the testing fee now, Valencia charges $30 unless they increased price, or you can online proctor from \"home\" for $30.\n\noh and you can change testing locations and be sure to set up your testing appt asap\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood Luck",

Daughter did composition and college algebra as sophomore in HS (her best SAT was 1280 to give perspective) and passed.  They aren\u2019t that hard , don\u2019t overthink and you will be fine.  Locally some competitive DE kids have earned 45 credits taking CLEP exams ,  some kind of wierd who can have most college credits at high school graduation competition amongst friends.  Obviously they aren\u2019t that hard (they say easier that AP)",

The English caused problems because it meant she had already satisfied all of her college English requirement but was still 2 high school credits short in terms of English credits for graduation.   Eventually I got the School district to accept some higher level Literature courses at the college to satisfy High school English.",

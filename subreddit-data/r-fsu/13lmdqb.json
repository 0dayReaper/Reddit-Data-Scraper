    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019ll be attending FSU as a Freshman starting in the summer. I plan on getting there from Fort Lauderdale using the RedCoach bus system since it\u2019s the most affordable option and I don\u2019t have a car. It says that i\u2019m allowed two pieces of luggage and one carry on free of charge. However, i\u2019m kind of worried that this won\u2019t be enough space to bring all of my stuff. Has anyone had any personal experience related to my situation? Any insight is appreciated!",

Also, there are tons of people heading between tally and ft laurderdale all the time - I go multiple times a year - so you might be able to find  someone to drive some stuff.  And consider if you\u2019re going to head home between summer and fall or any time between now and December.  Tip: it\u2019s Florida, but not south Florida.  It was in the 20s for a week in December. So you may acquire some different clothes in the fall that you\u2019ll need to take home.",

You won't need that much there clothing wise. Winter comes later and it's mild. Bring those clothes on thanksgiving break. You will also get lots of tshirts there. Don't pack your fears, pack your needs. Also amazon delivers. Things link laundry baskets should be those mesh ones that fold up and weigh nothing. Target and Walmart are nearby as well as a cvs.  A duffle also folds up nice. Please don't bring hard sided luggage. That said you can also buy cheap square duffel bags off Amazon or eBay.  You may want a little safe or book safe for things like papers, passports and spare atm card etc. also grab some AirTags. One on your keys, in your wallet and in ur backpack with laptop. When you leave one behind it notifies your phone. Super handy.  As for shirts, there aren't a lot of logo or branded stuff on campus. I mean the student body is super casual. You are definitely gonna want some good walking shoes.",

They\u2019re huge and I fit 75% of my stuff into that and the other 25% in the luggage. Red Coach drivers are generally pretty chill, especially if you\u2019re taking a super early/super late trip. Donate as much as you can, and get a camping suitcase.",

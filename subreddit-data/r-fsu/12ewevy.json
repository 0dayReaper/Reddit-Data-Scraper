            "comment": "Lots of nature -- [the Rez](https://campusrec.fsu.edu/outdoors/rez/) but also the city park system is great and there's everything from very manicured parks to more natural ones. Tallahassee Nursery is also fun to walk around. \n\nTake advantage of the free/reduced price stuff on campus -- the Student Life Cinema, bowling, pottery painting (I think they still have that?). There are clubs on campus for just about anything you can think of too.\n\nMidtown is great for different restaurants and more grad student/local vibe. There's also a rockclimbing gym. The AMC in the old Tallahassee mall has super comfy recliners. Midtown Caboose has some crazy burgers to try (and you can get a Beyond burger or black bean burger if you're vegetarian). \n\nFirst Fridays in Railroad Square can get busy, but it's a more artsy/alternative crowd. There's still drinking, but it's not Greek party-level. There are art galleries, thrift stores, a used book store with cats (Fat Cat). The Bark is nearby, which is a vegetarian place that will have events like live music and karaoke weekly. 926 also has karaoke nights. Both places have an alternative/queer vibe if that's your thing. Tally Cat Cafe is another option if you're a cat person and they have great coffee. Finnegan's Wake and Ology are both bars, but they are also an older crowd and have jam nights. \n\nThe beaches and whatnot about an hour south are great too. \n\nTLDR: There's plenty to do here outside of partying. I hope you enjoy your time here!",

Crochet club? International coffee hour? Pottery?  Art museum? That\u2019s all on campus.  You can get to a \u201cbeach\u201d (sand, water, marshland, gorgeous sunsets, lighthouse) like St Marks Wildlife Refuge in less than an hour.  You can get to a more classic beach experience (St George, Gulf of Mexico) in under 2. Concerts at Cascades park, bike trails, festivals, art shows, disc golf courses - basically if you like art or nature, you\u2019re set.",

St George has decent bodysurfing waves, a beach town feel (ice cream shop, bike rental, seafood bars, long stretches of white sand). The state park there has camping facilities, the main beach has public bathrooms and beach showers.",

First Friday at Railroad Square. Lots of food. Breweries if you want to enjoy a beer or two without being in a party environment. If you have an apartment outside of campus and have the room, looking for their or deals on stuff online can be fun in Tally, lots of college folks getting rid of stuff, lots of old folks getting rid of stuff. There are a couple of bowling alleys, one on campus. A few music choices around town. They're are the McClay Gardens to explore. Lots of parks in the city. Lots going on in Tally if you look around. There used to be books you could get as travel guides that were good, Fromers, try to find one of those to help find hidden things.",

There\u2019s also a lot of sports activities on FSU, and there\u2019s usually always a sport to watch on campus. CMX theater is the nicest theater in town, and there\u2019s a gorgeous state park in the Killearn area. FSU always has events going on, so I\u2019d like out for those. Downtown isn\u2019t as alive as it used to be growing up, but it has so pretty nice eats.",

    "postText": "So basically I was fully rejected from FSU yesterday with a 1300 SAT and 4.5 GPA. I also had numerous extracurriculars that aligned with my major. I applied for summer term. FSU was my #1 choice/dream school. I was wondering if there was anything else I could do. Would it be a good idea to re-apply for rolling admissions as the deadline is March. Or should I try to appeal the decision with my mid-year grade report. Please let me know if anyone has suggestions or any type of help. Thanks.",

Just get the AA as soon as you can (including credits that you may already have) and transfer to FSU. When you graduate, your degree looks the exact same as somebody who was there for the 4 years.",

At TCC you'll get FSU professors who are moonlighting to get extra $$$. Then after 2 years boom you're in FSU. My gf, now wife, went to TCC first two years while i went to FSU. She received a much better education for all the liberal arts classes. Smaller class size, more interactions with better teachers,  and of course...way cheaper! She still went to all the fsu football games and all the extra curricular stuff",

Don't be so hard on yourself. \n\nWhen I was 17 I failed (with a D) an extra DE class my last semester of my senior year and when I was at orientation at FSU they did an all-call to call me to Admissions. They revoked my acceptance until I could prove I could handle it. \n\nNow I teach high school AP English. A student who failed both her AP English exams texted me this week saying how impressed her professors have been with her essays,  but she was frustrated because she failed the exams... but she was PREPARED for college! That is what matters to me. \n\nMy best advice would be to call admissions and see what they suggest. Plan z, you attend TCC for a few semesters. Obstacles are good. You're going to be fine, I promise, as long as you continue to preserver.",

You did everything right and sadly the way admissions are decided is basically someone makes a coin toss.\n\nLots of people saying \"do two years at community college...\" Personally, I dont even think it takes that long. One semester, to my knowledge, will immediately change your status as a first-time applicant to a transfer student. I have NEVER heard of any transfer student regardless of how many semesters/credits they are transferring with getting rejected.\n\nFor what it is worth, I wholeheartedly believe you should not go to college immediately after high school until you have at least two years of community college and ideally some work experience under your belt to REALLY solidfy what and WHY you are pursuing an education in the first place. Too many students are force fed into the machine and spat back out with stress and anxiety disorders among lots and lots of student debt. Sadly, nothing has changed in the past 10 years (when my college journey first started) from what I can see",

Sometimes admissions can work with transfer students before the AA who were denied as freshmen but were very borderline, you'd just need to reach out to admissions to see if you would fall into that category and what you would need to take to be eligible to transfer.\n\nAs a former transfer counselor, lots of transfer applicants are denied. Admission for transfers is much more straightforward than freshmen, but you do have to be strategic and knowledgeable about what you're taking, when you're taking it, and when you choose to apply.\n\nAll this to say - call admissions and request to speak to a transfer rep if you're considering the option!",

Also, I think one semester at any community college would change your status from first time college student to transfer student. You don't even have to go to TCC - you could take one semester and stay in your home town and reapply for Spring. :-)",

            "comment": "One thing most people fail to realize in the admissions game is the numbers mean nothing on their own.  To say you had a 4.5 GPA, means little without context.  Was it a 4.5 taking only AP and DE classes or was it a 4.5 taking an easier level course load?  Additionally, schools like FSU look at the strength of your Senior Year schedule.  Did you take the bare minimum of classes or did you challenge yourself with the most rigorous courses and a full schedule including a high-level math?  The answers to these questions help to distinguish why some people with seemingly lesser stats got accepted while you were denied. \n\nI am a college counselor and have had to have many uncomfortable and frank conversations with students who expected different results than they got when it came to the admissions process to their dream schools.  I am truly sorry for the way things worked out for you, I know you are very disappointed.  My advice to you would be to go to TCC and then transfer as soon as you are eligible.  In the end your degree will say \u201cFSU,\u201d it WON\u2019T say \u201cFSU(with a delayed start at TCC)\u201d",

Do some programs have more \"slots\" than others?  For example, International affairs is seen as easy to get into while Biology or CS are more competitive.  \n\nHow much does Dual Enrollment (with AA) look at major pre reqs taken during DE?  For example does having Macro/Micro Econ and Financial/managerial accounting completed during DE help?\n\nFinally, (only because I know a student who did this) How much laughter would a DE freshman applicant get by admissions at if they had 100+ credits including all engineer pre-requisites (calc123, Physics 1&amp;2) if they applied as undecided?",

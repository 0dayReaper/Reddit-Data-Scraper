What you should focus on is knowing exactly when deadlines are and start the process early incase something goes wrong. To be a little blunt, knowing the deadlines and requirements is more important than good scores, since your good scores mean nothing if you miss deadlines by like 7 months lol",

It\u2019s just odd that you were out of the loop when everyone around you is applying to university (assuming that you\u2019re taking AP and college level classes).  Also I don\u2019t think you need that high of an SAT, most people that I\u2019ve talked to got an 1250-1400 or a bit more. I feel like 1500 may be overkill. You may just want to start working/getting involved in the field of your major. Because studying and paying money for the SAT again seems like a waste of time.",

Should I expect to be able to pull this same maneuver at the UF game or will seats be in high enough demand that I\u2019ll want to reserve tickets?",

So you are quite screwed if that doesn\u2019t work and have to go secondary market. The same is true for football btw with any big game. Clemson or Miami etc\u2026 this year it would be Miami.",

    "postText": "I know FSU is an amazing school and I have lived in FL for nearly ten years. I am growing more concerned with the living standards in Florida by the day. (And no, I am not looking to debate this. There are many who still see Florida as a utopia. This post is not directed toward you.) \n\nI began thinking that there have been other scary times in FL - whether coming in from out-of-state or deciding to stay in FL - how did you make the choice to attend during uncertain political times? How did you find the school's protection for free thought/free speech during these times?",

You *might* be able to trust a particular department to have your back, but their reach can be limited.\n\nMore tangibly, perhaps, you should not rely on stipends and other benefits (such as healthcare subsidies) staying at their current level for an extended period of time. There is a substantial -- not definite -- chance that the grad student union soon gets decertified, which would give the university free reign to change the terms of minimum stipends and benefits. If you're going into a wealthy department, they may simply pay above the minimum, so it won't be a huge deal. Still, you would lose certain important protections against workplace harassment and overwork.\n\nIn all, I think it should be a consideration.",

            "comment": "As a graduate student I fail to see how the current political climate of Florida will affect your ability to get a good education. There is an exception to this and that depends on your degree program/field of study. Are you in STEM, business, international affairs, the arts? You're fine. If your degree happens to fall more under the humanities, particularly with respect to sociology, I think you have a right to be worried about potential mentors leaving. \n\nThis raises another point. If you're a non-thesis master's student, then none of this matters. You're coming to take classes. That's it. I can't see them just saying \"no more classes, leave with no degree\". Depending on your field, you may or may not have a slightly altered curriculum, but I'd go as far to assure you that most professors tend to scoff at things like this and still teach what they like. With the freedom behind course design, this is more than likely what will happen. Standardization of the state college system would essentially send the educational pedigree of Florida into the abyss, and the partisan language coming from the government while concerning, doesn't want to discourage people from not moving to Florida. \n\nNow, if you're a doctoral student or if you'll be doing a thesis and you happen to be in the subgroup I defined in my first paragraph, you need to contact any and all advisors you would potentially want to work under/with. Your primary concern as a graduate student at this level should be that the professors you want to work with would be pissed, field offers from another institution, and leave before you finish your degree. That's really the primary thing that could go wrong.\n\nThe Florida secret police aren't going to kick down your apartment door and muzzle you and send you off to re-education camps. Freedom of speech still exists, and as a graduate student, your opportunities to learn and grow as an expert in your field should not be hindered. Now, if you were a professor in the humanities weighing job offers, then we'd be having a different conversation. But you aren't. If you liked FSU and if there are people there you're excited to work with, go. Feel free to dm me or continue this thread if you'd like. Best of luck in your decision and Go Noles!!!",

As yourself and others have pointed out, it\u2019s a solid reason for a faculty member/recruit to go to another state. The current political climate discourages diversity and serves as a deterrent to FSU as a whole. The beliefs that are being targeted are not exclusive to the humanities. Diverse faculty members/recruits and their allies in other fields are going to be affected too\u2014 especially if they serve on diversity/inclusion committees within their respective departments, which now have to be disclosed to the state government. It\u2019s a real possibility that your department, no matter the field, becomes weaker over the next few years as people leave, the university fails to attract top talent, and policy potentially becomes more restrictive.",

                            "comment": "Thank you for sharing your thoughts. As a point, I am currently a graduate student in STEM, so I've been in science at this level for years now. I went to FSU for undergrad. I am currently at an R1 institution working on my doctorate. I say this not to say I am better than you or smarter since I've been in grad school longer, but rather to offer context for what I'm saying. There is always a probability that a mentor will leave. I would agree with the statement that in STEM, the probability of this in Florida is slightly higher. I do not believe the change to be significant. While professors may be bothered by the climate, we need to consider what it would mean to move. I can outline this in a few points. First, will adjuncts/teaching faculty perhaps move to other institutions? Of course. I would argue this is the majority of \"professors moving to new states\" that we have been hearing about. Does this suck? Yes. Does this affect the ability of OP to get a strong education in a STEM field? No. Adjuncts and teaching faculty are plentiful and they are desperate for positions. They would quickly be replaced and the ability of OP to get an unhindered graduate-level education remains unchanged. Is it morally problematic for us to view those in these positions as such an easily replaceable commodity? Sure, we could have that discussion, and I suspect we would find quite a bit of common ground. But that wasn't what OP was asking about so I didn't discuss it. \r  \n\r  \nThe second point relates to Tenure-track research faculty, whom OP (if they are in a STEM field) may consider speaking to about joining their labs. Tenure-track positions in STEM are not plentiful. They are rare to come by and they are incredibly competitive. May some faculty be unhappy with the current political climate in Florida? Yeah, probably. I would say most probably are to be honest. Does that mean they're about to uproot their entire family and lives to venture out into the abyss that is academia all over again and leave behind a tenure-track position that they've already fought tooth and nail to get in the first place? No way. Some may put out some feelers to see if it\u2019s even an option but ultimately, there aren\u2019t a surplus of positions out there for professors to just pack up and move to another comparable university of their choosing. \r  \n\r  \nFinally, we get to the last point which is that of funding and prestige. Most funding for research in STEM fields comes from federal or private organizations. State organizations may contribute a bit, but not really a meaningful amount in the grand scheme of things. Importantly, federal and private organizations are not under the control of the government of Florida, nor do they know the grant they are reviewing is from a professor in Florida (as that could raise personal biases). So, it\u2019s not like STEM labs across Florida are going to suddenly be defunded which would be the only other hyperbolic situation in which I could picture a mass exodus of faculty from the state. \r  \n\r  \nAll this to say; my point to OP was to consider what field they may be in, think about how politics may affect that field. Is your primary field of research related to racism and/or gender? You may have some real and serious concerns as to whether your possible mentors will stay/be fired. You may even be worried that you won\u2019t be able to research what you want. I\u2019ll point out, however, that the proposed tenure review would come up only once every 5 years. This means that even if your mentor was found in violation and was fired, OP would probably graduate no problem anyways. This is also assuming tenure review passes. Remember, a lot of professors are part of unions, and making a serious play at taking away tenure is sure to result in a long, drawn-out legal battle. I find the political climate reprehensible right now, but it's ultimately my opinion that if OP happens to be in STEM, none of the climate really has a serious risk of affecting their ability to get a great graduate education from a great university and work with great people in their field. \n\nI\u2019m most likely going to stop responding in this thread since I think I\u2019ve been long-winded enough at this point but if you or anyone else would like to continue the conversation or ask me questions, I\u2019m happy to do so in private messages. Thank you for disagreeing respectfully and sharing your points. I wish you luck as you enter grad school and start your doctorate. As someone who is a few years in, it\u2019s a ton of fun (and also really freaking stressful)!",

I teach CRT and the university has been (surprisingly) supportive against the laws attempting to restrict our teaching. However, I\u2019m not sure how long that will last. \n\nIf you are transgender, teach CRT (or subject matter related to diversity and inclusion), or would be in a department effected by the upcoming laws, I\u2019d look elsewhere. Tallahassee is a liberal haven in a swamp of deep red, but the state\u2019s pretty fucked. Honestly, if you have options elsewhere, I\u2019d consider them no matter your department. \n\nIt\u2019s a tough decision. Best of luck.",

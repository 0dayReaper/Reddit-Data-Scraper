    "postText": "hi! i know this has been asked before but i read there was a recent change in policy, i'm just not sure if it applies to undegrad. I just realized I got a C- in a class last spring I thought I earned a B in, I'm not sure exactly what made my grade drop so much in the end. Could I take it again for a better grade, or is there another sort of thing I could do?? I'm about to be a senior so I'm getting real stressed, it's my only other C ever and they're bringing me down more than I thought they could",

Some departments won't give you credit for the repeat but the grade will calculate into your GPA. I think the biology and chem department are examples.",

A lot of apartments around here have mold problems.\n\nMy ex girlfriend's apartment had a mold problem that was making me really sick. Took me an embarrassingly long time to figure out I would get better by simply not going to her apartment.\n\nIf it is allergies, I recommend Zyrtec cause it doesn't make me drowsy, and Flonase (fluticasone proprionate) to manage runny nose/cough/post nasal drip.\n\nETA: I should probably mention that while Flonase works great, it can cause nosebleeds if used too often. Typically one spray in each nostril per day won't cause problems, but more than that and you're looking at potential nosebleeds.",

I finally figured it was the vent because I'd wake up fine when I stayed over at my boyfriend's or with friends. Put in a maintenance request and I was fine for the rest of the year.",

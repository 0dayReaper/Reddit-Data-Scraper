    "postText": "I feel like both gyms are always so crowded, and it is super frustrating to always have to wait to use machines. When are the gyms less crowded? Also, is anyone else bitter that the gyms are always closed during breaks and that the FMC isn't open on weekends and has such limited hours? Why do we pay for recreation if we can't even use anything bc it's so crowded?",

Throughout the rest of the day it\u2019s going to be crowded, there are 45k people who attend this school so it makes sense. \n\nThe FMC opens in the middle of the day so it\u2019s always crowded unfortunately.",

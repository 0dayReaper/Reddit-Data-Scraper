I use a refillable water bottle, so I\u2019d like do know if I need to get a Bria filter or something.",

I kept a Brita pitcher in my dorm freshman year because my room was as far as possible from our floor's water fountain in Landis and it was nice to have nearby in the middle of the night, but otherwise Britas aren't super necessary especially with how small the fridges are.",

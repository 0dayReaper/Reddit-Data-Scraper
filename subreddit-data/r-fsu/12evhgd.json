    "postText": "Hey everyone, \n\nSo I recently attempted to register for CHM2211 to take over the summer, and the class closed within two minutes of the reserve caps lifting. I have already made the commitment to stay in Tallahassee over the summer, and I really need this class to be able to graduate on time. I was wondering if anyone knew my chances of being able to get into this class or any suggestions for who to contact (other than my advisor).",

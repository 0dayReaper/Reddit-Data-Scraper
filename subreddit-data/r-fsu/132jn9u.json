More than once I had being approached by drugged homeless people asking for money and they can get mad if you dont give them anything. And, the only school cops I see there is giving student parking tickets and then leaving in a hurry!\nEveryone has to say something, we just can't sit around and wait for something bad happen to one of our kids. We have to see new changes any deterrent will help.",

They cost money that people don\u2019t want to spend, bottom line.\n\nThe case was against an apartment complex that knew (provable by email correspondence) that they had a consistent problem with gang activity and violence on their property, and did nothing.\n\nFinally a pregnant women was hit by a stray bullet and died, while her three year old child looked on.\n\nRound the clock armed security is by the far the most effective (and expensive) deterrent to this kind of thing, and if there is an obvious problem with violence FSU needs to take action BEFORE someone dies.\n\nWe found for the plaintiff and awarded a trust of tens of millions of dollars for her toddler, to his legal guardians.\n\nI did rough math on this. If you had to incur a cost of $20 an hour to pay a guard to sit there 24/7, that is $480/day. That\u2019s about $175,000 a year.\n\nFSU could pay for that security presence for A HUNDRED YEARS, and still not pay the amount of money we awarded the plaintiff in that case. It also could save a human life.",

Tell me why degraff can\u2019t have one armed, off duty police officer working security as a side gig (that\u2019s the industry standard), or an FSUPD officer dedicated to that lot, at least after dark.\n\nDeGraff is in a dangerous area. There is nothing else FSU can do, but invest in armed security on that little island property, and protect the students who live there. Otherwise they need to tear it down and make it a park or something.\n\nI don\u2019t see why one armed guard can\u2019t happen, so please. Enlighten me.",

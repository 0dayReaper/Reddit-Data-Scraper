This was the pool you got taken to during summer camps in the 80s/90s. The sides were made of metal, so they were basically untouchable in the heat. We also weren't allowed to swim in the lane areas, just in that weird little section up at the front, and that had to have been at least 5 ft deep. So bear in mind we're elementary age children swimming in this tiny area....your feet don't touch the bottom and then anytime you try and grab onto the walls you burn your hands. It was a bad time",

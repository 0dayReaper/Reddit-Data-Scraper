    "postText": "Anyone have a problem with scammers? I was looking for an extra ticket, and my mom found some guy in the FSU class of '23 FB group. Figured out he was a scam, so I told her to what to watch out for. She came back and had me pay someone half the agreed-on price before they sent the ticket, and half after it was done. Sent the first payment and they ghosted. Come to find out, my mom never even asked for proof that the tickets exists\ud83d\ude2d. Anyone else have a similar experience?",

If you can't find ANYTHING on their page saying they're attending FSU or can't even find them on the FSU email directory (which is possible btw), they're most likely a scammer. I always liked to check in with the FB page as well and even make a post asking if anyone else had received an offer from that person or if anyone knew about potential scamming.\n\nPersonally, I asked my person to send me a screenshot of the email confirmation with the link to their tickets. Always verify that they got that email, that they're a student, and that they're not overcharging you.\n\nBest of luck and congratulations on your graduation!!!",

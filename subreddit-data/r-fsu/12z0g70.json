I think this is something I will strongly regret a few years down the line, like I \u201cmissed out\u201d on the \u201cbest four years of my life\u201d or whatever, but I just don\u2019t even know where I was supposed to start.",

            "comment": "Get involved instead of just going to class is the easy answer but I see this question all the time here so I\u2019ll go more in depth. What are you interests or major? (rhetorical question). FSU most likely has a club that fits you interest/major and that\u2019s a great way to make friends who share a common theme and it looks great when you are applying for an entry level job. Make a GroupMe, now that you\u2019re a junior you will be in your major classes which shrinks the amount of different people you will see. I used to ask people in the first week to join a \u201cclass GroupMe\u201d where people could post reminders and study sessions,eventually it will branch out to social events  (I promise nobody is gonna judge you by asking to join a GroupMe). Even if it doesn\u2019t you still have grown your network of likeminded professionals. I personally have had more fun on life post college so don\u2019t get too down on yourself.  I believe the Student Affairs office holds different types of meet and greets as well (I graduated a few years ago so it could be different). The overarching lesson is that you are going to have to put in ACTIVE effort because pop culture over hypes the social aspect of college, you are just 1/40,000 students at FSU it\u2019s easy for you to blend in :) hope that helps and doesn\u2019t sound condescending.",

I proactively put myself out there by joining a bunch of clubs, and specifically a business fraternity where I met my current best friends - 10 years later.  Can\u2019t recommend it enough.",

I worked at a few bars in town. Began serving and barbacking and eventually started bartending. Same people came in every week so naturally you develop friendships. That to say- there was a NY times article a few years back that dissected adult friendships and why they\u2019re difficult to make. They posited that friendships boiled down to proximity and time. Most young kids formed friendships with children that had similar last names because they were around one another most often. My advice, much like others, would be find something you are interested in. Whether it be sports, jobs, or clubs. Friends will follow. Worst case scenario is you gain a skill/money for the future!",

Search here: https://nolecentral.dsa.fsu.edu/organizations  You can also find clubs at market days, walking around landis, going to international coffee hour- it just depends on what you\u2019re into. Campus ministries are another option. Landis is great - you\u2019ll see people painting or in the middle of a nerf battle. Go where people are.",

I have met all my friends in classes and through going to tutoring oddly enough. Tutoring groups always have a bunch of people who are struggling and so it gives everyone something to talk (complain) about. I just exchange numbers with whoever is there and ask them to study together. Then just by studying with others I have met some really awesome people!",

Board games, poker, video games, sports what ever you like just go do it and around others. On of my friends today I met because he was just walking around the dorm asking random people if they wanted to play the board game Risk.",

    "postText": "This seems like a very generic question and probably has been asked multiple times on this reddit, so sorry for its repetitiveness. I\u2019m an engineering student just looking for simple scholarships, just to pay off some books and lab fees. I luckily have bright futures to cover my credit costs, but as some know those stem fees are no joke. Any recommendations for scholarships/websites to look at for extra aid?",

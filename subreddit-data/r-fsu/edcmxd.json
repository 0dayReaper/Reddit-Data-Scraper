            "comment": "Congrats!  I was a cc transfer too to FSU and I had a great time. My suggestion is to look into joining professional organizations / clubs on campus right away - it was an awesome way to meet people being an incoming JR (you miss out on the bonding that typically occurs living in a dorm your freshman year, so this can make up for that) and I\u2019m still close friends with a lot of these people 12 years after graduation. \n\nIf you\u2019re a business major or even looking to learn more about business and have a good time, might I suggest Alpha Kappa Psi/AKPsi (professional business fraternity). It provides much more social value and activities than just joining a typical club, sharpen your skills and increase your confidence when you start interviewing for your first job and/or grad school.",

            "comment": "The difficulty, in my opinion, completely depends on how many credits you come in with and if/how those credits apply to your required courses. \n\nSome people that do the program have a completely regular class load, and take a regular semester of masters courses in their final year. \n\nAnd other people also bust their ass and do extra classes than a normal class schedule to ensure they are able to do the program. \n\nIn my opinion, it\u2019s pretty individual",

Thats actually degree in one plus masters.  So if you want a good answer talk to advising or GPS for your major and look at where you are and what you\u2019ll have to do.",

Things are slightly better than they were, but it's still hell.\n\nDepending on your budget and what you want compared to their stock, CarMax is easy to deal with. They do tend to be more premium priced (though hell, anymore everyone is), and they don't really haggle, but it's basically a \"here's the car, here's the price, let's do paperwork\" experience.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s not the answer you are going to want to hear, but you are better off buying in Orlando or Tampa. I was searching for a slightly used 4Runner like 3 years ago, and the same car/same mileage in Orlando went for like $4k more in Tally. Jax is also better priced/more options than Tally, but Orlando/Tampa are better. I actually arranged to buy mine in WPB - I bought it out the door for $24k, where the same thing was going in tally for $30k. \n\nIt\u2019s worth the drive/time if you have a friend where the car is located that you trust/has common sense that can test drive a few things for you if you know exactly what you want. You can set up the appointments for them to test drive, and then just take them out to a nice dinner or pay them for their time.  Could also FaceTime so it\u2019s almost like you are there. \n\nI did my research ahead of time so I felt comfortable negotiating over the phone. We even negotiated my trade in over the phone, so when I went into the dealership, all I had to do is check out the car myself, and sign the paperwork.  The process may take a bit longer, but it was more than worth it for me.",

    "postText": "Hey I am considering to go to FSU next year and I would like to know if I would get a better opportunity hear academically than my other colleges. I am planning to major in finance. My other colleges are NYU ( if I get in ), Rutgers, and IU (Kelley). Rutgers is my in state school, however it costs about the same as FSU. Kelley is more expensive but its ranked higher for business. FSU has a beautiful campus and I think it has the best social life out of the four.",

It\u2019s a a town that happens to have the state capital. I love it here but I don\u2019t love big cities so. The school atmosphere is unmatched though! If you want a lot of camaraderie in a school then FSU or IU are probably your best bet.",

I went to FSU for college and live in NYC now, I always knew I wanted to live in NY but as for college I also knew I wanted the traditional university experience.\n\nThe college experience in NYC will be different than at a southern state school. Not better/worse, just preference.",

They\u2019re not in the same leagues in any category. NYU is in Manhattan, the best social life in the country, and is a top 10 business school, the connections there cannot be matched. \n\nOther than NYU, FSU is the clear winner though. Amazing college-town social life experience, very supportive community, and location in Florida is far better than Indiana and Jersey. The business program is solid too, not elite like NYU, but solid.",

Yes, Tallahassee would have banks that you could intern at but there are fewer large banks and no headquarters for banks in Tallahassee.  There are a couple of credit unions that have headquarters in Tallahassee though I am not sure if they have large enough offices to take on interns, but you could try to find out by writing an email to the finance department at FSU college of business to find out what kinds of internship placements they have for students.",

            "comment": "Like others have said for finance NYU is the better bet simply because its in Manhattan. For everything else FSU is going to be better. I certainly would not pick Rutgers over FSU.\n\nI went to FSU in 2002. In the 20+ years since I don't know that I've ever met anyone who regretted going to school there. There were many people who did different things afterward or did grad studies elsewhere, but I don't know too many people who didn't really enjoy their time in Tallahassee. It's a great place. Maybe the best decision I've ever made. I live in NYC now, but always look to find fellow Noles here. What you'll get at FSU that you may not at NYU is a lasting comraderie and connection to a broader community. When I went home to California I can go to a football watch party and be in a room with a hundred other people who I don't know and we're all buddies because of our mutual connection to Florida State. You're sort of connected to the broader alumni base even if its just superficially. NYU isn't quite like that unless you're in the film school.",

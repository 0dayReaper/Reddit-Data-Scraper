It\u2019ll be on for a minute then go out for 30 seconds. Is anyone else experiencing a similar issue? Any suggestions to resolve the issue?",

The ITS service center on their website also has status checks which tells you if there is a known problem, and you can report a specific problem if you don't see a status about it",

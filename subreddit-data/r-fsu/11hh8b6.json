But I worry that it would be weird or that I would end up living with freshmen. Does anyone here have any experience living on campus as a grad student, especially one with an assistantship?",

Plus you almost definitely wouldn\u2019t be in a freshman dorm\u2014 most likely in apartment style w upperclassmen + a few grad students. I rly recommend calling housing they\u2019re rly helpful and nice!! Also office of accessibility services.",

            "comment": "Traditions and Ragans are where normally grad students are placed.  Both have single rooms, though you can submit documentation to request a single room for medical reasons if you are not able to get one of the grad student halls.  The only thing I could think that would be awkward would be if you were teaching a class section or break out session and you had your apartmentmates as students which would be unlikely and you could seek help from your department if it happened.  I lived in Ragans while being a grad student with an assistantship and the housing department was fine about it.  Though Traditions is the hall you probably want as a grad student so you don't have to move out between the spring, summer, and fall semesters as Ragans no longer is a year round hall as it was before Traditions was built.  Ragans and Traditions would place you in a non-traditional students apartment which would mean your apartment mates would either be grad students, or undergraduates over 23, or transfer students from community college having already earned an AA.  It is possible that if you live in Ragans in other portions of the building there would be Freshmen, but they would probably be on other floors, though with Freshmen living in your building there is a higher chance for fire alarms going off because they have not figured out how to cook without making enough smoke to setoff the fire alarm.",

    "postText": "** living, not lining, ugh\n\nMy daughter will be an FSU freshman, fall 2023. She\u2019ll be coming in from out of state, and she\u2019s hoping/planning to live on campus. \n\nFor a variety of reasons, we\u2019re hesitant for her to have a car there. (Primary reason simply being that she\u2019s a new and inexperienced driver.)\n\nHow easy or difficult is it to manage campus life without a vehicle? She\u2019s wondering about how to get to Target, grocery store, etc. I\u2019m wondering if between Uber and Instacart, is it that big of an issue to not have a car? \n\nThanks in advance for your insights and experiences!",

Grocery\u2019s can be found about 15 min walk off campus at a really nice greenwise.\n\nAs for other kind of living, you really don\u2019t need a car on campus if you stay on it. The entire thing is walkable in about 20 min, and all your amenities are within 10 min of campus. If your daughter likes to travel or go to the Rez (beach-like lake) then I\u2019d ofc bring your car. Parking is one of the biggest drawbacks on campus, but I brought my car up freshman year and greatly enjoy the freedom! \n\nDM me I\u2019d you have any more questions! Hope this helps :)",

Your daughter will be living in suite style dorms without only a communal kitchen for the floor and a very small fridge/freezer. I doubt she will want to cook beyond the microwave. If she has a meal plan there is no reason more than an occasional trip off campus is needed for supplies and that can be done with friends that have cars. You have anything you would need in your day-to-day on or super close to campus like CVS just steps away. You can also order stuff online. A car is more of a hassle and my friends hated driving places because parking is a pain on campus. The biggest downside is she will not be able to easily leave Tallahassee say to go to JAX for a larger more affordable airport but I had friends from JAX that offered to drive me especially if I paid for gas. With that said I did fly from Tallahassee a lot as it just was easier and the cost usually made the hassle of going to JAX/MCO to save $100-200 not worth it.",

She\u2019ll get used to walking but honestly everything I needed was pretty nearby like max amount I\u2019d ever have to walk is 20 minutes and that was for special occasions on the usual everything is within campus. There\u2019s a target or Publix near one side of the campus. A CVS on the other for basic needs. Then the campus bus takes you there as well even without it you could walk it. The only times I had to Uber was if I had appointments made off of campus but the campus has a health and wellness center for primary care and other speciality visits like psychiatry and dental etc. She will be totally fine without a car\n\nEdit: Instacart will also definitely cover getting groceries well enough and she\u2019ll rarely have to Uber. Even if she wants to hang with friends at least one person will have a car and she can manage. A lot of hangout spots for undergrads are walking distance from campus anyway so she\u2019ll do fine",

Like others have said you tend to make friends or find people with cars that will give you rides. It have never been a problem for me, so I would say it\u2019s very manageable. Insta-cart is another option for groceries and greenwise although expensive is within walking distance. Otherwise an Uber every so often is perfectly viable.",

Driving is a crucial skill specially when emergencies happen wether it be needing to go to a hospital or leaving the city during a hurricane. Being able to do so on your own and not depending on others is good. OP let her drive. She can even find people to help her practice.",

Is it an absolute pain in the ass for your kid, also yes. \n\nThere is on-campus dining and if you purchase a meal plan then yeah she will be ok, but the closest grocery store to campus (at least most dorms) is the greenwise which 1-2 miles away depending on location of the dorm. \n\nShe could always Uber to target and wherever else she needs, but IMO that\u2019s an unnecessary expense. My parents use walmart+ and get free shipping so I just have everything shipped to my dorm but again, it\u2019s a pain in the ass. \n\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not just on campus living. There have been multiple occasions I\u2019ve wanted to visit friends at other schools, travel for football games, go home when I\u2019m homesick, etc and I haven\u2019t been able to. My parents have spent probably 2k just getting me to and from campus every time I wanted/needed to go home. \n\nBut to answer your question, yes, it\u2019s possible, but be prepared to deal with many issues that will arise.",

There's a greenwise on Gaines street, and a CVS right across the street. Everything else (like Target/walmart/etc) is pretty far from campus and Tallahassee is one of the most pedestrian unfriendly cities I've ever lived in. If you don't mind spending extra on uber/instacart/delivery, you're ok. However in my personal experience those charges start to add up. I would save your uber money if you like to go out at night, because the city buses don't run into the night and night nole only runs in areas around campus. The city bus is a cheaper alternative (free for FSU students), but it's a little iffy. The bus app is off lots of times and will suggest that you get on buses that aren't running that day, or lead you to the wrong spot for a stop. Parking on campus is a nightmare, so even if I had a car I wouldn't want it here. Your best bet is to have friends with cars in my experience.",

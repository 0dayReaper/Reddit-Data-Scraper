Even among conservatives, students have the options of going to now double-champion UGA or GT without the added drama.\n\n4) No, FSU isn\u2019t going to rise in rankings.",

Once that information was in hand, Dr. Ayres said, the team ran simulations giving various factors different weights to see the potential outcomes before deciding on a final method.\u00a0 \n&gt; Dr. Ayres said that approach violates fundamental social-science research standards in which the methodology is specified ahead of time to prevent anyone from reverse-engineering a preferred result.\n\nI get that college administrators care a lot about these rankings. But I don't see a good reason for students or anyone else to spend even a moment giving them a thought.",

Not caring about them would be ignoring the very people administrators are paid to address.\n\nAbout the method, we have to get used to the fact that measures, especially those that have perceptual components, are flawed. But that doesn't mean they don't matter or that they don't pick up on important data. In fact, my degree from FSU is much more valuable than it was when I got it because we're now a Top 20 public university in the US News rankings. Yours will be more valuable if we go from 20 to 15, and so on.\n\nIgnoring the rankings based on some misguided attempt to take the high road is a losing proposition - one that we tragically followed until Barron and Thrasher took over. Let's not go back to those dark days.",

Our new president is also focused on growing our medical research, which will generate a lot more revenue. The biggest problem is FSU's relatively small endowment. If FSU could land a huge donation in the hundreds of millions, it would move FSU up a lot in the rankings.",

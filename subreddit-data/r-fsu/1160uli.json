Is this still true or just an artifact from Covid? I don\u2019t mind an online class once in awhile  but want a mostly traditional college experience!",

Some programs also like to reserve their in-person classes for students who are actually in their major - political science is an example of that where are they only let political science majors into their in-person intro courses. Everybody else who takes them for whatever reason has to take them online.",

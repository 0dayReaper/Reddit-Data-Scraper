Tighten up or accept the fact that you're imposing consequences for your behavior on everyone, which includes you petulant children who can't be bothered to follow basic public health advice. \n\nWe're ALL sick of this pandemic shit\nI wanna party too, I miss meeting girls. I'm single in the middle of all this bullshit and I'm not letting my dick do the thinking. I was making musical breakthroughs and getting ready to play shows before the lockdown, you think I don't wanna pack people in a room and make them dance? Of course I do, but this ain't the time to be selfish, because your actions affect the people around you. \n\nPlease wear your masks correctly, over your nose. Figure out ways to hang out with people that don't involve literally poisoning your immune system and packing into buildings like sardines. Cmon yall, think outside the box. \n\nFucksakes.",

If your account is new or very little activity and you do this it is a permanent ban.",

Nope, you get to look at my masked dumb face and get irritated, because guess what, this shit is happening and anything other than full compliance is some weak shit you WILL be judged for, years from now. \n\nI have an idiot friend I split with who is currently alienating a lot of people, including me, by not taking this seriously and putting his ego over the possibility of him being wrong. It's personally made me loose all respect for the guy, to the point where anything outside of a public apology and complete acknowledgement of his arrogance isn't gonna get him back on my island. And I'm going places and doing cool shit, when the time comes to bring people along for the ride he ain't coming.\n\nThere's a permanent record of your stupidity and selfishness, remember that.

Pretty much every other country has got a handle on this except America.\n\nI mean you're totally right and people sould def not be partying, I just don't like this narrative that the FSU administration and our federal and state governments are handling this more or less fine and the reason we have all these cases are poor choices by individuals instead of a failure to act by the government and the school.  If we lived in a civilized country this would have been solved months ago.  Instead, our leaders are having thousands of students come onto campus and having football games while acting like it's all these dumb kids fault...  They need to take some damn responsibility instead of acting all surprised when college students party.",

    "postText": "Back when I attended USF, they offered [official t-shirt](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/student-government/tampa-sg/tampa-services-involvement/ourshirt.aspx) to be worn at\u00a0all USF athletic events. Every year, the shirt is designed\u00a0by students, staff, or faculty members and chosen by students via popular\u00a0vote during the spring Student Body General Elections. It was sold at the USF bookstore for only $5 and it was decent quality. \n\nSo does FSU offer something similar?",

I think we stole the idea from UCF, not sure how common it is otherwise. \n\nI would check out the store at the stadium. Post football season, they usually have pretty good clearance.",

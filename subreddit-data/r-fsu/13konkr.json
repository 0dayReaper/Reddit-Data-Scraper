    "postText": "I wanted to ask a genuine question regarding ACG 2071. It is so infamously difficult among business majors however I feel like most courses at this school are difficult for some folks. I had heard in the past that Skoolers was almost required for ACG 2021 and I did not use it and still managed to get a solid A in the class. Would I be foolish to not use Skoolers for ACG 2071, or are the naysayers really not putting in enough time and effort to truly understand the material of these courses?",

I took managerial accounting this past spring semester and after the first exam I knew that I needed skoolers. IMO, managerial is 100X harder than financial, and skoolers is a necessity. I barely passed managerial with an A, but I credit any/all learning I had in that class to skoolers.\n\nFind what works for you, but I HIGHLY recommend you get skoolers for managerial",

I just genuinely struggled with managerial (hardest class I\u2019ve ever taken) and I found myself needing it. \n\nI\u2019ve heard that if you are good at financial you\u2019ll be bad at managerial and vice versa. That was the case for me, but it may not be for you. Most of sudanos in-person students did very well and a lot of them didn\u2019t use skoolers. I was an online student of hers and I found it necessary. That may also factor into any decision for you so keep that in mind as well",

You *will* have a LOT of studying to do (like 10-15 hours a week) and it will be frustrating throughout most of the semester. It is doable, tho! Just gotta get through it lol.",

I attended and took notes for every lecture, studied regularly during the week, and began preparing for exams a week in advance by using Skoolers, office hours, and ACE and I only passed the class with a 76 (2 points of which was extra credit). To the person who says only lazy people don\u2019t pass, literally fuck you.",

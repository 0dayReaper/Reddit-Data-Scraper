I'd just wear my headset when I lived there.\n\nJust a warning, some of the rooms there are infested with roaches, and no amount of requesting an exterminator will help.\n\nMy room was so bad, they let me out of my lease at the end of the fall semester.\n\nHope you have a better experience!",

Never saw a single one in the year I lived there. 1 room down from us, absolutely horrid roach infestation.\n\nIt's hit or miss. Probably wouldn't be as bad if housing would actually pay the exterminators to actually exterminate the damned things.\n\nThe exterminator would come like every 2 weeks and put the smallest amount of some insecticide around our sink and shower drains. Needless to say, it didn't work cause the roaches clearly weren't coming from the drains.",

You can hear the footballs games going on as well, and during the spring the lacrosse teams use the field so if anything they tend to be the loudest when they have games. The halls are relatively quiet since the dorm is for upperclassmen and we know how to handle ourselves lol. Also I've never had any issues with bugs so don't worry too much",

Every Sunday at 2pm there\u2019d be a weird crackly noise out of the fire alarms in every room in the building. This is normal and happens every week without fail, it startled me every time but it\u2019s not that bad. It was my favorite on campus accommodation! (And for the record, I never once saw a roach when I was there)",

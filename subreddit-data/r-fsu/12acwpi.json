    "postText": "Hii! I committed to fsu for the fall semester and I have paid the admissions deposit and submitted the housing contract.  My next step is to register for orientation but the dates are in june and july for which I can't come in person. (I'm from Asia btw)\nI emailed fsu orientation and new student services but haven't heard back yet.\nSo my question is, did any of you face the same issue and how did you register for orientation?\nThanks a lot!!",

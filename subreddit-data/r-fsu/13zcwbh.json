    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m planning on transferring to FSU this spring. It would be the second semester of my first year but I have more credits due to early college. I\u2019m wondering if transferring would make it harder to get friends there\u2026 I also would love to rush for a sorority but don\u2019t know if fsu has a spring rush/how it is. Any information can help!",

You could make friends with similar circumstances as you there. If not, there's always a club for any given interest. Pick what you are passionate about and go make friends.",

Put yourself out there and you'll make friends. \n\nSpring rush is essentially based on numbers from Fall rush, so you won't know who has spring rush until closer to that time. Typically, though you'll have at least a handful to half of the sororities recruiting in spring. There was something called winterfest , which is a casual intro to spring recruitment. Genuinely not sure if it's still a thing, but keep an eye out for that and see if it's your vibe.",

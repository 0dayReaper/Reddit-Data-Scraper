    "postText": "So my university offers exchange programs and one of the schools that caught my eye was FSU. I've obviously heard what everyone else hears about this school and I think it's got a pretty good rep. I don't know many aussie girls that currently attend FSU, but me and my friends are looking to go for a semester and see how it goes. As far as education goes, I want to obviously prioritise that but also have a bit of fun without completely binning my degree. What are some things I should be wary of? Are people from there familiar with aussie culture? Do they even like it lol? Some tips would help! Much thanks.",

            "comment": "As someone who\u2019s worked with the FSU Global \u2018Noles, the group that helps exchange students acclimate to life in Tallahassee and America, I\u2019ve heard a lot of what people love and complain about. Also, as someone who\u2019s thinking of going to grad school in Oz, I\u2019ve done a bit of research into the differences between living in both countries. I\u2019ll provide some of the biggest things I think may be helpful below:\n\n1. Parties and fun: this is the biggest strong suit of being in Tally over other college towns in Florida; there is always something fun to do. Some instagram pages I would recommend following are @thescene_tlh, @thebarkfl, and my good friend and DJ Dylan at @Dal3di. They put on great raves with their friends and in really cool places as well. Very progressive space and tolerance is maintained through security and the atmosphere in general. Generally parties have a cover to pay and someone acting as security so people can feel more safe (except for fraternity parties lmao). Every first Friday there is an event at \u201cRailroad Square\u201d, an art district just south of campus. For outdoor activities FSU is great. Students get into a place called the rez for free, with kayaking, rock climbing, and other things free. Piney Z and Lafayette heritage parks are good for hiking. Lake Jackson mounds has 800 year old Native American mounds that are very interesting. The Tallahassee museum has zip lining and other fun. \n\nWalkability: this is Tallahassee\u2019s biggest flaw. I know Australia can be pretty un walkable too, since both countries followed similar development patterns, but I think the us is just a bit worse. It is crucial picking an apartment to make sure you\u2019re close enough to walk to a supermarket or class, or else you will have to buy an Instacart subscription and spend far too much money. Public transit (buses) can be unreliable, but also a life saver. FSU website has a detailed instruction page for how to get the route on an app. Also apartments are extremely competitive here, so it may actually be worth getting a sublease from someone who dropped out or picked another apartment. A lot of subleases are officially done through the management company and can get you into a top level apartment that was filled since last October. Otherwise just be careful and be aware that apartments inflate their reviews through buying fake accounts. Being on campus might not be the worst decision, but If you\u2019re lower classmen then sharing a room that is difficult. \n\nClasses and campus: I think this is another strong suit of FSU is that it\u2019s campus is amazing. It seemed like our exchange to Aus (Brisbane) had smaller spread out campuses for different majors, but everything here is in one place. It lets you make friends with people on vastly different tracks, and generally is a very convenient thing for going between classes. There are plenty of dining options on campus (some better than others), but you\u2019ll be totally content spending a whole day here. All classes are a 10-15 minute walk, and the architecture is very iconic and consistent. There are specific places to visit on campus, like the student life center that has free movie theater, board games, gaming computers, and pottery painting, or the student union, which has extremely cheap bowling and billiards. We\u2019re a top 15 public school, so you won\u2019t be throwing away your education. \n\nClimate: this is a struggle in Tallahassee, especially for fall semester because it goes straight from hot to cool, but it\u2019s kinda like the worst day in Brisbane but every day. Humid, stagnant, and no sea breeze to relieve you. But, once it\u2019s fall it is dry and crisp low 20s high teens Celsius. Just be prepared for that first month, especially since you\u2019ll be walking. The buses aren\u2019t so bad lol. Also holy shit, there are bugs. It\u2019s funny that I\u2019m saying this to an Australian, but our bugs are a different genre of bad. Queensland has the \u201cyou\u2019ll die in 15 minutes\u201d ants and we have the flying roaches and extremely painful caterpillars. If you see a fuzzy caterpillar do not touch it. Also we have these bright orange ants and they are called cow killers. Generally these are very rare but Tallahassee is a wooded city so bugs are much more at home here than a concrete jungle. The only thing that could kill you are water moccasins, but they don\u2019t hold a candle to king browns or anything in Aus nature. Also with humidity don\u2019t put your bed against a window because it will generate mold, and it may be a good idea to get a dehumidifier for certain first floor rooms. \n\nClubs and orgs: there are over 700 clubs on campus and they are super diverse in what they cover. Check on nolecentral.dsa.fsu.edu for the specifics, and that site also posts all interesting campus events. \n\nCulture: fsu is less diverse than a lot of schools in the US, much less Australia. Luckily there are student orgs to be a part of for any culture or identity that put on fun events and things. Global \u2018Noles puts on events for exchange students and works very hard to accommodate needs. If you get a mentor, not gonna lie you can make them your chauffeur. I loved doing it for my mentees because it was an excuse to talk and learn something. \n\nRegarding specific people who know at least a little about Aussie culture, I wish I was here next year but I\u2019ll (hopefully) be off on an exchange myself. I do know a girl who studied at ANU for undergrad, and another who is South African-Australian. I don\u2019t wanna drop their @ in a public forum for obvious reasons but if you want I could DM them. Generally Americans are gonna like the accent and think it\u2019s cool, but they won\u2019t know very much about Aussie culture. I think cringe comedy is less popular here so it might be hard to get your roommates to laugh at Fat Pizza or All Aussie Adventures. But generally though, the only annoying thing is gonna be dumb misconceptions people have. I don\u2019t think a lot of people know that Australia is the richest nation on earth and has a ton of really cool cities and great nature. They just imagine the Northern Territory and FNQ. \n\nOverall: overall I would say that FSU is the Quintessential American school. Everything great and everything evil. We have an amazing group of students and faculty, and we also have a far right governor who banned abortion past six weeks, and is trying his hardest to limit the curriculum on our campus. On the other hand FSU has CHAW, a very progressive health organization that does STD testing for free and helps with contraceptives and pregnancy tests. The staff there are heroes and I love a lot of what they do. There is a lot of love and support here and as much as Florida or the US is frustrating to live in at times, I\u2019m proud to be here.",

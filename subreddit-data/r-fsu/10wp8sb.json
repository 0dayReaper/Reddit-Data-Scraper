    "postText": "I am a finance major in my junior year. I was thinking about picking up real estate as a second major, but everyone I have talked to said it would be a waste. Mainly because of how easy it would be to get my license instead of taking the major. I wanted to add the major to learn more about it instead of just getting a license. Any thoughts or comments are appreciated.",

            "comment": "Absolutely disagreed. I went to FSU and picked up a real estate major. It is truly helpful if you want to do anything with real estate. It goes into advanced real estate issues such as major developments, valuing apartment buildings, etc. etc. I also went to real estate school for a license. It is basically third grade elementary school compared to The FSU real estate major",

You\u2019ll be able to get finance jobs in real estate investments firms pretty easily with both.\n\nThat being said, if it extends your graduation date at all, don\u2019t do it. There are a bunch of real estate masters degrees you can do instead while getting the same knowledge at a higher level.",

    "postText": "I was checking my portal in anticipation for a decision regarding my Honors application for this fall, and I saw a new button and video that I was selected as a semi-finalist to be a Presidential Scholar! However, I don\u2019t have an updated letter/status update, and no information regarding acceptance as an Honors student. Does anyone have info regarding if I should still be waiting for my Honors decision, or if this means I was accepted? Also, does anyone know how competitive it is to be chosen as a Presidential Scholar? Thanks!\n\nUPDATE: 10 minutes later, my portal now shows no sign of being chosen as a Presidential Scholar Semi-Finalist. The button is gone. I\u2019m hoping this will be resolved by this afternoon.",

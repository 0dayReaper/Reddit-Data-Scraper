    "postText": "Hey all! \n\nI opted to skip one of my finals for a class that wasn\u2019t really important (i only took it to keep my fin aid) and without the final I\u2019ll end up with a B in the class. Now, i\u2019m graduating this Friday and i\u2019m supposed to be magna cum laude but with that B, my gpa is definitely dropping below the 3.7 cutoff. \n\nI already have my cord for it, so i\u2019m wondering \u2014 will I be still be able to graduate with that honors at the ceremony? Do they even mention the distinctions during it? \n\nNot that it matters too much (i\u2019m just glad it\u2019s finally over lmao) but I am curious!",

You just can\u2019t put it on a resume or anything.",

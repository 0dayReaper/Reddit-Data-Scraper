The problem I have, as a grad student, is that we still have to \\*\\*work\\*\\*, proffesors still have to \\*\\*work\\*\\*.  The reason \"this would have happened anyway\" is frustrating is our ability to go back to work (or feel comfortable working) is inhibited by the campus community being open in general to people like this.  Other work establishments can incorporate a basically \"back to regularly scheduled buisness\" because their safety measures will work and have far fewer moving parts.  If campus does a full shut down, that means even employees can't go back to their office until campus implements a repopulation protocol.  So, even though the likelihood of us interacting with anyone when our building has one person to the office shifts and is only occupied at 50% capacity, we have to start from zero again if events like this keep happening.",

If your lease is genuinely unbreakable, your money is *gone* whether you came back to Tallahassee or not. If you had a housing option elsewhere that doesn't cost more money (like with your parents), the money you put into your unbreakable Tallahassee lease only really bought you a higher chance of catching/transmitting COVID. And this has been true since March, so people have had time to think it through. We're just not wired to do it very well.\n\nObviously, not everyone's in that situation: some people needed to move to get work done, or would've needed another lease to stay somewhere else, etc. But \"unbreakable lease\" by itself *does not* mean \"I had to come back to Tallahassee.\"",

I lost so much sleep living here, my mental health plummeted. You\u2019re just not safe here. At least I don\u2019t feel that I am. There\u2019s so many domestic disputes, the cops are here at least 3x a week. We got a text about two months ago that TPD is going to be making rounds around the complex more often. It\u2019s only gotten worse since I moved in. Please please please do your research. I hope you find something :\u2019)",

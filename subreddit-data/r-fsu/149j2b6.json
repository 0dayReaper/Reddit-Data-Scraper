However, I just transferred to FSU with an AA degree so I have some experience with that process.\n\nIf you have an AA and want the best chance at being admitted you should have all the prerequisite courses for upper division completed.[http://undergrad1.its.fsu.edu/academic\\_guide/guide-display.php?program=physics-astrophysics](http://undergrad1.its.fsu.edu/academic_guide/guide-display.php?program=physics-astrophysics)\n\nSpecifically:  \n\\- MAC X311 (4) Calculus with Analytic Geometry I  \n\\- MAC X312 (4) Calculus with Analytic Geometry II  \n\\- MAC X313 (4) Calculus with Analytic Geometry III  \n\\- \\*CHM X045, X045L (3,1) General Chemistry I with Lab (or equivalent)  \n\\- \\*CHM X046, X046L (3,1) General Chemistry II with Lab  \n\\- PHY X048C (5) General Physics A or PHY X048/X048L  \n\\- PHY X049C (5) General Physics B or PHY X049/X049L\n\nIt says that chemistry is a Florida prereq, but not an FSU prereq, so I'm not sure if you need those. You should contact the department and ask.\n\nIt also recommends taking MAP 2302 (3) Ordinary Differential Equations before transferring, but that's not necessary.\n\nYou shouldn't need a \"Physics AA.\" Just a regular AA and those courses will work.",

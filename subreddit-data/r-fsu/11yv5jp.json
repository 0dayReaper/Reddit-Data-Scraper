Or is \"2022\" a typo? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mmfeevhzlcpa1.png?width=1066&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d4d7f442c80172ac92df8355fc23bee0a7a17a5d",

It\u2019s strange that a scholarship would ask for that. You should clarify with them because I doubt anyone else applying will be able to comply with the request regardless of institution. Not even high schools do that. Good luck!",

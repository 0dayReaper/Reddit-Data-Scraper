    "postText": "Hi! so I really don\u2019t have any spanish experience and I just finished spanish 1 here at FSU. Regardless of those, I think i\u2019m gonna try to take the spanish placement exam to test out of spanish 2 and 3. Id much rather study really hard for a couple of months to get out of those classes then to take/ pay for them. For anyone that\u2019s taken it, is this even feasible? Also, what tips would you give to prepare? Should I use duolingo? Quizlet? something else? Thanks!",

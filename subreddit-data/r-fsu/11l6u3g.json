I took it online and managed an A- but that was mostly because several students would get on Zoom calls before exams and help each other study so I have them to thank. If you\u2019re worried about the difficulty, I would recommend trying to do it in person, but if you think you\u2019ll have a handle on things then online would be fine. Think standard deviations, t-statistics, and that sort of thing in terms of content. Basically one step further than basic stats with a political research context.",

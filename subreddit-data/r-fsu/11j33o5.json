            "comment": "Do you know anyone you can room with?  My best housing experiences were sharing a small rental house, duplex, or townhouse with friends.  Unless you really want a pool, there are a lot of perks to a house vs an apartment.  There are lots of small property management companies so that you still have management vs an individual. There are trade offs with every place.  Also, a mile off campus can mean very different things depending on the side of campus.  Neighborhoods vary, but also, being a mile from the stadium is very different than being a mile from the library, depending on where you might want to walk more frequently. It\u2019s a little over a mile between the stadium and the library, so something to think about if you plan to walk to campus (parking is terrible, so walk/bike/skateboard).",

            "comment": "I've yet to have a really good apartment experience in Tallahassee so at the very least I can tell you what to avoid. \n\nI didn't like Quantum. My roommates were partiers, walls are paper thin. I was right by an entry way and was constantly woken up by drunk groups of people coming in. The management isn't really that great either. In my opinion it is also really overpriced for the tiny ass room. Parking also SUCKED, you share a parking garage with another complex and it was just hell sometimes having to haul groceries from the fifth floor, down elevator, walk to door, etc...\n\nPreserve isn't too bad. Kitchen is a tad outdated and we had a bug problem that never got taken care of.  I could be wrong but I don't think it's in the best part of town? I constantly heard gunshots and break ins were common. I wasn't a fan of having to get packages through the front office. Once they lost my roommate's package and kind of had a \"deal with it\" attitude and claimed it wasn't really their fault since they have to deal with so many things. Other than that room is a decent size and it was overall a good complex. Really only moved since I had plans to move in with a friend. \n\nI'm currently at the Social 1600, or I guess now it's under new management as Acasa Bainbridge. I cannot wait to move out. I'd say roughly 90% of apartments are so dirty and beyond basic cleaning. All of these units need serious renovations. On the day I moved in, a buuunch of people dropped out of the lease because of how filthy the apartments were; they were not ready to move in and I remember someone showing me a picture of their furniture being ripped/broken. My apartment wasn't in terrible condition but there were a lot of things like the cabinets being filthy, the tile in the foyer being cracked and forming a hole (after numerous requests, never fixed). Management also is a circus. The property manager left so now the only person who is even qualified for the position is dealing with everything. They have only 2 people working in the office at the moment. I had to change units due to roommate issues, and at the least I can say they were accommodating and understanding and quickly helped me out. \n\nFrom what I've heard, stay away from anything that has \"Social\" in it. I also advise against student housing. But I get that isn't always affordable. I hear Polo Club is nice, but I toured it and I personally think, like most student housing places, rent is way too high for a tiny room. \n\nI hope this was at least a little helpful and good luck searching.",

They're starting a new policy where they have an income bracket though. I think the price is reasonable just unfortunately there's no telling the quality of your apartment or roommates.",

The fact that the apartments are next to big frat houses scares a lot of people away, but they keep to themselves and you never notice or hear them in my experience. Maintenance and staff are very competent and speedy. I've had maintenance requests completed on the same day I requested them, and never longer than a week after the request.\n\nIt's about a 30 minute walk to the middle of campus, with biking and bussing also being good options.\n\nOnly downside is that they're increasing prices substantially for the next year (I think \u2248$800/month)",

It\u2019s on 2 bus lines and management has been great this year (although the property manager did just leave bc she got promoted to regional manager\u2026 no issues with the new one so far but I haven\u2019t met her personally). The un-renovated units are kind of sketch but the renovated ones are really nice\u2014 mine is huge (about 1000 sqft) and cheap (I pay $525 for the smaller bedroom, bf pays $545 for the master suite) which is a great combo around here. We did have a drive by shooting in the parking lot in October but it only happened once and in Tallahassee you can either be picky about that kind of thing or pay under $800 a month but not both. I smell weed less often here than on campus or at any of my friends\u2019 current or former apartments. I think they\u2019re changing the system so you have to lease the whole unit instead of the bedroom for next year so either do a 1b1b or trust your roommate very well. Good proximity to campus and the tiny target is less than a mile\u2019s walk. They\u2019re prompt about maintenance and try to have fun perks and events (at Christmas they had one where if you came by the office between noon and four on one specific day they\u2019d give you a free blanket and fluffy socks). After 8 months of living here I think I can honestly say it\u2019s the best complex in town and would recommend it to my friends.",

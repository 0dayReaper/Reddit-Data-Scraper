    "postText": "I need five more hours of non music electives for my last semester over summer. So far I am taking muh3212 music history II which is required for my major, daa1000 contemporary dance I for non dance majors, and pem1121 stretch and relaxation. I wanted to do the education minor, but it seems as though they are not offering the remainder of the courses I need. Thank you.",

If you use another IDE other than that, make sure it compiles and works perfectly with Clion, or as others have said make sure it works through the unix systems. Emacs, vi/vim.",

Its mostly about basic commands, how to compile, flags, how to turn in an assignment. It really depends on the course. I\u2019m also referring to  undergrad. I have no idea what graduate school is like.",

Personally I use the Jetbrains suite for everything, you can do pretty much everything in the major with IDEA, CLion, and Rider (just for C#). The only time there was ever any reason not to use one of those 3 was a Data Structures project where we had to use a Linux specific library and so Mac/Windows users had to develop on linprog (the cs linus server) with emacs/vi. Beyond that its just up to personal preference.",

    "postText": "Hello. I just received the opportunity to be an undergrad TA for Fall 2023 and Spring 2024. I am having trouble finding information about it. I know that graduate TAs get a stipend/tuition waiver/etc. \n\nSo as an undergrad TA, will I receive the same benefits or what other benefits? What things would I need to do and is it even worth being a TA? I am potentially graduating Spring 2024.",

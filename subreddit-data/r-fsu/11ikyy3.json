Many of the professors were lazy in their grading/feedback/responses. Much of the course content was outdated or irrelevant for use in the real world with no intention of changing it anytime soon. Overall I was very unimpressed with the CS program. Maybe it has changed since then or other programs are better but I doubt it. The whole experience has made me skeptical of and cynical about the entire college education system in general so take this with a grain of salt... but yeah that's my 2 cents.",

Although, I have no context in comparison to other Florida universities.\n\n- There are some professors actually trying to revamp the program like C. Mills and S. Jayaraman, but there's also lots of red tape from what I hear.\n- I was forced to do most of my mandatory classes in C/C++, but it's to my understanding that they're starting to allow Rust in some of them, which is neat.\n- FSU requires Theory of Comp for their degree, which I don't think other universities do. IIRC, UF has it marked as a CIS4930 elective.\n\nIt's to my understanding however, that generally any FL CS program is \"held back\", because of the fact that FL high schools allow students to graduate with little math credits. All you need to graduate HS in FL is Algebra 1, and most CS classes require Calc 1 as a prereq. To get there you need to take Trig and Precalc, and both of those require College Algebra or a good ALEKS test score. Worst case, that's a 4 semester delay. They're obligated to design their degree so that it's possible that everyone can graduate in 8 terms, so everything CS specific must be able to be crammed within the last 4.\n\nI would argue the CS professors are trying to keep the program up to date, but... It's hard.",

The definition of a mascot means to be a person (or some other things) adopted by a group as a symbolic figure https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mascot. \n\nSure it\u2019s not our official mascot, but it performs most of the same functions as one. And above all, people see it as one. It is an official symbol of the university. And yes, we try to be respectful with our depictions of Osceola and Renegade, so we won\u2019t see the performer do anything dumb like some other mascots might. Though, FSU has the brand of the Seminoles. That brand is something the university has to always treat with respect. And again, it\u2019s debatable whether the use of certain imagery is respectful. \n\nhttps://unicomm.fsu.edu/brand/understanding/faq/seminole-imagery/\n\nAll in all, I wouldn\u2019t mind it if the university decides to pull away from using the Seminoles as the main symbol of our university. It sure would simply things. Additionally, We still can honor them in other ways and not every tradition has to be removed as well.",

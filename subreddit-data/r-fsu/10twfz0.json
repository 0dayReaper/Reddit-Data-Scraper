The building is aging\u2026 and not well after poor upkeep and college. Not to mention when I moved out the manager lied to me about closing my utility account so both my roommate and myself got hit with a big fee (they were basically charging us both for the same electric bill) after they told us to close the account. There was zero accountability in the office. Whatever it was a mostly safe, mostly quiet place to live for a year close to campus not sure if anywhere is actually better all complexes have issues.",

The rooms are horribly outdated with broken appliances, horrible lighting and terrible amenities. I\u2019ve had my washer break 3 times, my stove doesn\u2019t turn on and the walls are so thin that there is barely any privacy. It used to be a cheap place to live but they raised rents 200$ which is unbelievable for how old the building is. The security is terrible, there have been alerts about people keying cars in the parking lot, trash that filled the hallways entrances on multiple occasion. There are much newer places that are at the same price as the Luxe but offer much better amenities and quality rooms. I fucking hate it here",

I like the idea of a parking garage but the garage is so small that ever time I try to drive out a car nearly crashed into me going around the bends. Save your money and live elsewhere",

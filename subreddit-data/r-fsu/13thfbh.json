If you dont have the credits already an intro to statistics course might serve you well as I saw you mentioned you are a BS major and youll have to take calculus based statistics eventually. The intro to applied statistics class can almost always be taken online, takes minimal effort, and sets a good foundation. Other than that it looks good, best of luck in the Fall!",

Philosophy oddly is a good prep for discrete math, I took intro to philosophy at a community college before coming to FSU and it covered formal logic which is incredibly helpful for discrete 1, but I dont know if FSU\u2019s class does, may be worth looking into anyway. Statistics like I said is a good option generally, and the earlier you can knock out your science requirements (bio/physics) the better, although I definitely wouldnt recommend taking calc 2 + science + discrete in the same semester if you can help it. Getting at least part of that science out of the way before that semester comes may be worthwhile. There really arent any bad choices as far as gen ed classes go, as long as they dont overly hinder whatver major classes you are taking at the same time.",

So if they fund you at Fulltime 12+ hours, you need to pass 12+ hours. This means that if you take 15, you can fail one class and still be fine with Bright futures because 12 credits is still fulltime. But if you only take 12, and fail a class you\u2019ll be in trouble with Bright Futures, because only passing 9 credits will drop you to 3/4 time. The rules are weird you can call bright futures and clarify but you\u2019ll be good with 12 credits. The only consideration is you have the FSU freshman scholarship they have different credit requirementz",

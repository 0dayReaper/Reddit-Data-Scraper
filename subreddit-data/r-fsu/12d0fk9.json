    "postText": "Hi. I just found out yesterday I was selected as an alternate for the Presidential Scholars Program. I know this means I am basically on a waitlist, but does anyone know how the process of being selected from here works? I\u2019m also curious how many scholars were chosen this year and how many alternates they choose? Can anyone shed some light onto how good my chances are? FSU is a top choice of mine and I\u2019m really honored to have made it this far.",

But, even if you end up not getting the scholarship, I would really recommend coming to FSU. \n\nAnd congrats on being an alternate!! It means they still want to see you in the fall and would love to have you in the class :)",

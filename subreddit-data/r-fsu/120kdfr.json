    "postText": "Scholarship displacement. Its where someone who receives financial aid gets any amount of private scholarship money received taken off of financial aid. \n\nEx. Let\u2019s say a student received $20,000 in financial aid, and they received $2,000 in private scholarships. You would be forced to report the scholarships you won to the college, and in turn the college reduces students financial aid to $18,000 and adds the $2,000 to that aid package.\n\nIt\u2019s a total scam for low and middle income students.",

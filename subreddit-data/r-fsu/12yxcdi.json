Would they still be able to go on the campus at least a little without it? On that same note, do I need to stay on campus during it? We\u2019re just gonna get a hotel and I\u2019d rather do that. Just kinda confused on the specifics of orientation.",

As a student you will get a significant value from orientation, your parents won\u2019t learn anything they can\u2019t read on the Internet in ten minutes.\n\nAlso, for the many freshmen with helicopter parents, being willing to send their student off to orientation alone is a good way to start letting them figure things out on their own.",

I wanted to see the inside of a dorm room. Not able to! I wanted to understand financial aid and how my son went about getting it. You had like 20 minutes to maybe talk to somebody. It was not worth the flight and the hotel cost in the end. I think they should set up virtual meetings with parents to review information for out-of-state. All they talked about was Florida scholarship and bright futures. Nothing for the parents that came from out of state. And we pay three to four times more than the in-state parents. If you ask me, we should have been given more priority because we pay more and we don't have easy access to deal with issues.",

For parents its going over stuff that you can read about online, and a lot of the information isn\u2019t really that important for parents as in college the students are adults and have to do the business interacting with the university themselves, which is a big difference from K12 where parents are quite a bit more involved in what is happening with the school.",

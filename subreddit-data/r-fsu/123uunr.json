    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI am a potential transfer student coming in as a Junior. I wanted to ask about the social life for transfer students and how easy it was to make friends. I am gay and introverted so I do not see myself going out more than twice a month. I just wanted to hear the experiences of other transfer students and how they acclimated (Friends, Clubs, Etc.). Thanks",

            "comment": "I was a junior transfer student and am bi. It was incredibly easy to make friends, and FSU has a pretty robust LGBT community. There\u2019s a gay nightclub called 926 which is near campus that\u2019s fun, and there\u2019s a decently large student organization called \u201cpride student union\u201d where you can meet people.\n\nI had my FSU friend circle before I even technically was an FSU student just by going out in Tallahassee the summer before my first semester and meeting people from this exact Reddit page.",

I\u2019m not gay but I have a ton of friends in the community and there\u2019s plenty of clubs (meaning school organizations) that have many members in the community (Queer Hikes, ESP, etc.). Also the actual club 926 is super fun and pretty welcoming for all. I\u2019ve made tons of friends through clubs and intramural sports, plus frequenting places like Kavakaze and the Innovation Hub. I\u2019m graduating and don\u2019t want to leave. lol. But it\u2019s been a good time.",

Yes, the party school reputation is real, but there are so many other options and a lot of very welcoming clubs for any interest imaginable. Nerf club? Pottery classes? Larping? You name it, you can probably find a group for it at FSU.",
